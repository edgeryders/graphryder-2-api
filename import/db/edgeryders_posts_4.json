You can rinse it with some vinegar before and after to clean it out. If you happen to have sturdy ones made of fired clay or similar they will be even better for cooling. I'm not sure how the surface is where you'll be, so watch out that no one slips (e.g. have sth to dry off feet). If a wire from a notebook drops into the water, it should not be dangerous as they generally use 16-20V or so. Nothing really dangerous.\n\nIf you are not all sitting at a table - see you can find wooden boards (20-50% larger than the notebook, about as thick as a finger) to put it on. It fixes the heat problem and also makes things much easier on the notebook, e.g. when you carry it around. If there will be a lot of people you want to have 2 quiet ventilators (one moving the air in, one pushing it out in the direction of the wind). Each person or notebook heats with around 50 W. So 10 people + notebooks are like a plug-in heater on full power...\n\nPhysical well being is really important if you want to get good results at a meeting - but I'm sure given your background you know this better than I do.

Took me a while to reply because [I had a deadline](https://twitter.com/andrestaltz/status/1213814520147324938). \n\nOn collective intelligence, I realize Alberto has quite different intuitions about it than I do. The things I was envisioning during that interview were specific designs that could shape internet interactions towards being more \"meaningful\" or \"efficient\". Two designs I'd like to share:\n\nSocial bookmarking, but not the way it has been done so far. When you browse the web with a classical browser, it highlights visited links in purple, and non-visited links in blue. It shows *your footprint* of browsing the web, but no one else's. What if you could see links that others visited too? Now, before you think about the privacy implications of that, we could bypass that problem by only highlighting links that others have *shared publicly*. And by *others*, I'm talking about friends, or people you follow. This design is quite achievable with Scuttlebutt: it's a matter of processing all the web links shared on SSB, indexing them, and then in the browser through an extension we can highlight links with a special symbol, in case they were shared by friends on SSB, and we can annotate those links with the comment they placed when they shared the link. What Wikipedia did for the collective compilation of knowledge, we could do for the collective exploration of the internet.\n\nAnother idea is to extend [WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com/) (or an alternative to it, such as Orgmode) with MMO (massive multiplayer online) capabilities. I use WorkFlowy for all my personal info, notes, journaling, etc. Its slogan is \"Organize your brain\". What if we extend the \"your\" to \"our\"? With @zelf and other Europe-based Scuttlebutters we started using WorkFlowy to sketch our notes, and the collaboration model is quite similar to a shared Google Doc. But with the difference that with infinitely-nested lists, we can have just one document and refactor that as we go. So far the experiment has been very fruitful, and we're getting really efficient at using it. One person may make a sublist for a certain bullet point, and insert a \"where is web link for this?\" and another person may suddenly web search that and fill in that info. When we're online at the same time it feels like collective lego playing, but with nested lists. It's essentially mindmapping, but *productive*, uncluttered, and efficient, with more emphasis on productive than on mindmapping.\n\nMaria, I recall seeing this H2020 initiative with Worldbrain and others from somewhere!

We concluded that the drivers for adopting technology \u2013 any \u2013 in schools are generally driven by proprietary interests with little or no philosophical or ethical value ground. Proprietary software providers have the resources for marketing and lobby, plus, access to decision makers and policymakers.

This raises many questions.\n\n\u2018Not even software developers\u2019 seems aware about the fundamentals of open source and the four freedoms. Since those are the baseline for all legal frameworks within open source licenses, copyright law, patent etc. this raises also more questions on how practice and policies are made in real life.\n\n**==== Research Question: #2 Summary ====**\n\n> *\u201dArticulate a few core principles or concepts that would help teachers navigate when educating in the age of internet and computers.\u201d*\n\nI found that its difficult to form consistent or shared thoughts on ethics without a common ground on which to base these ethics on. Despite the enlightened crowd participating in the workshop, opinions on \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d in software is not well grounded.\n\nMost people learned about \u201ccomputers and internet\u201d late in their lives and the age of the participants was relatively high (about 30), which also reveals the immaturity of these issues at present day. It raises more questions about future generations, which was also the motivator for the workshop itself.\n\nIt was a shared opinion that questions on ethics and morals in relation to software in general were much needed in education.\n\n\n**Exctraction from participants:**\n *Translated and minor edits to English from Swedish.*\n\nName a few things important to learn in schools:\n\n> \u201dParticipatory culture, the complexity of the works and noone should be just a consumer nor just producer.\u201d\n\nName a few positive outcome from teaching open source in schools:\n\n> \u201dStronger democracy, co-creative citizens, increased empathy, more active, more self reliant and responsible.\u201d\n\nHave you ever reflected over ethics in relation to computers and internet?\n\n> \u201dYes, how it affects Exposure and Exclusion\u201d\n\nWho are the most influential sources to what is taught on computers and internet in schools today\n\n> \u201dPoliticians and Skolverket (Department of Education) but there is a responsibility with the parents.\u201d\n\nHave you ever reflected over ethics in relation to computers and internet?\n\n> \u201cA society divided between owners/capable, vs, unpropertied/incapable will have a bleak future.\u201d", "created_at": "2019-12-21 13:53:09.256021", "updated_at": "2019-12-21 13:56:54.245226", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 644, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 113.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4934, 5661, 5083, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87132, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14893, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Dear community,\n\n*Seeing the way conversations and topics develop overtime on this platform of ours I decided to go to a seasonal schedule with the conversation overviews as I think this actually allows us to present you a better overview.*\n\n**That said, I would like to invite you to check out the discussions ongoing this autumn. Recently it is all about learning:**\n\n\n**What do we teach our children about technology while working from home?** We had an event together with freelancer week on the topic of https://edgeryders.eu/t/freelancing-remote-work-technology-and-childcare/14530 which touched on many interesting topics from workspace/time boundaries, over shifting perceptions to use of technology by children. This discussion on \nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/children-using-technology-polarising-potential-what-do-you-think/14892 does now follow up on one of those points. **Please, share your thoughts on experiences on the topic of children and technology, especially if you yourself are an avid technology user!**\nConnected to the topics of children education and technology I would also like to highlight two more posts: https://edgeryders.eu/t/media-and-information-literacy-and-open-learning-in-public-libraries/11464 and https://edgeryders.eu/t/assorted-thoughts-about-it-that-i-wish-i-knew-when-growing-up/11985.\n\n**Not only children need to learn. Remote workers and freelancer need to learn how to collaborate and unite.** In another event with freelancer week we discussed https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-freelancers-really-need-how-can-technology-help-freelancers-to-thrive-and-where-do-we-desperately-need-to-improve/14488. Our panellists raised great points about how you can now learn new skills online, good starter programs for new freelancers, networking and they all stressed one thing: **The future of freelancing is in collaboration.** We now need to go from \"one can do it all\" to \"everyone can work with everyone\" and the need for new tools designed to enable collaboration between multiple freelancers. Read the summary of the panel discussion here: https://edgeryders.eu/t/collaboration-over-competition-freelancer-technology-event-follow-up-article-1/14709\nAlso in reaction to the topics raised during the freelancers and technology event, @johncoate raise the topic of internet monopolies which is very relevant. https://edgeryders.eu/t/do-you-feel-threatened-by-internet-monopolies/14638\n\n**What can we learn about dealing with technology that could learn itself?** Anton Ekker won the first case in the EU against the sue of an AI algorithmic decision-making system and joined us for an AMA: https://edgeryders.eu/t/hi-i-m-anton-ekker-and-i-won-the-first-case-in-the-eu-against-government-use-of-an-algorithmic-decision-making-system-ama/14766\n\nAnd finally, we would like to invite you to join us to see what we can learn about economics from science fiction in our webinar about the progress of our Worldbuilding Academy and the 7th of December: https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-to-build-a-world-a-webinar-with-the-worldbuilding-academys-core-team/14773\n\nHave an educational autum and thank you for being a great community!", "created_at": "2020-11-18 15:29:13.504668", "updated_at": "2020-11-18 15:42:04.296837", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 521, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 187.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4096, 5485, 5083], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64569, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11337, "post_number": 20, "raw": "ping @hana_elsafoury_4 :).

As partners in the housing cooperative, residents aren\u2019t just safe from fire, they\u2019re sheltered from the ravages of the speculative real estate market by low, stabilized rents.\n>\n> The experimental group-housing project has been called Berlin\u2019s biggest WG. Each floor was \u201ccast\u201d with a compatible cluster of residents who live like an extended family. They share a communal living room \u2013 a kitchen, sofa and sometimes a table soccer game all surrounded by exposed wood floors, ceiling and columns.\n>\n> Around that space are private apartments, each around 60sqm. The project got a big boost from Berlin\u2019s government, a \u20ac2.5 million grant. In exchange, half the units are for people on financial assistance, with monthly rent around \u20ac6.50 per sqm (the city average is \u20ac10).\n> There are flats set aside for refugees and persons with dementia. Rents climb to \u20ac13.50 on the penthouse level. Back at ground level, Holzhaus has a caf\u00e9, day-care centre, and rehearsal space for musicians. Its diverse mix of people, functions and income levels is a model for urban development that resists \u201cghettoisation\u201d.\n\nI know there's stuff going on like the superblocks, but I'm not aware beyond that right now.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZORzsubQA_M\n\nSuggestions welcome :+1:", "created_at": "2019-09-07 19:25:35.410220", "updated_at": "2019-09-12 08:00:35.468994", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 327, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 46.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47168, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9005, "post_number": 19, "raw": ">as a computer scientist helping you guys to deal with and make sense of the data, one concern I have is >to identify approaches that can help ER's methodology to scale.\n\nWhere does machine learning come into the picture, if it does at all?  @hugi and I have discussed this a few times.  I used it back in the 90s to analyze multiple news sources so I could combine them onto single pages based on subject (for which we devised a categorizing system).  Back then it was all very proprietary, but nominal searching today shows that there are some possibly interesting open source products such as [RapidMiner](https://rapidminer.com/) with the [Aylien](https://aylien.com/) machine learning extension that evaluate text and graph it, including clustering graphs.\n\nDo codes ever get \"settled\" enough to trust augmentation of this sort, or of some sort?  Is this kind of augmentation too crude by our high standards?\n\nBecause it does scale. These products were created by large multinationals demanding so much from the \"document delivery\" community (\"super searchers\") that they needed help in their attempts to categorize and cross references thousands of pages of documents once they all got digitized.  Our using this to analyze news was unique at the time, which caused one of the big companies in the field, Autonomy, to work with us gratis, or nearly gratis, so they could enlarge the scope of their product. It was pioneering stuff at the time.\n\nSo in order to deal with how labor intensive document analysis is,  I wonder if we can go from one super ethnographer (Amelia) to a larger community (taught to use OE via the Academy), to a relatively stable code set, to something helped by machine augmentation.  Is this realistic?  Or, does it break over each data set (such as a set of conversations about populism vs. a set about the future of the internet) needing too many specific codes?  Or does it break because of something else?", "created_at": "2018-09-07 15:34:02.993684", "updated_at": "2018-09-07 15:34:02.993684", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 332, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 17.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [47154], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60636, "user_id": 4892, "topic_id": 10986, "post_number": 4, "raw": "thx much !!!", "created_at": "2019-10-04 08:50:22", "updated_at": "2019-10-04 08:53:38.409912", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 42.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [60633], "is_liked_by": [4934, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61302, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11073, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Thought you might find this useful for the event...\n\nData for Environmental Intelligence: A mega list of Earth System Datasets covering earth observations, climate, water, forests, biodiversity, ecology, protected areas, natural hazards, marine and the tracking of UN's Sustainable Development Goals \n\nhttps://github.com/rockita/Environmental_Intelligence", "created_at": "2019-10-14 10:26:08.299616", "updated_at": "2019-10-14 10:26:08.299616", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 47, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 43.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2567, 5040], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51548, "user_id": 4736, "topic_id": 9468, "post_number": 5, "raw": "**III.

I don't trust Breitbart. And I don't trust Fox. These are sources too, regularly invoked in many debates. Also, they sometimes publish accurate facts, when the facts suit their political agenda. In those cases, I will be making mistakes: I will think \"bah, these guys are liars\" and fail to recognize the truth. And yet, these are cases: on the whole I find my world map are more accurate if I ignore entirely certain sources. \n\n[quote=\"jasen_lakic, post:34, topic:14462\"]\nDoes it sound like science to you that billions of public money are spent to buy vaccines which haven\u2019t even been tested or manufactured, while we have only censured anything contradicting that vaccine-is the-only-solution narrative???\n[/quote]\n\nThat sounds like procurement. Which is a highly political process, with all the known bugs of capture, posturing, short-termism etc. etc. Why would you call it science? \n\n[quote=\"jasen_lakic, post:34, topic:14462\"]\nWhere is the science there? Is that science or politics and lobbying? So yes, I trust science and scientific method. But when I see examples like this one, which are facts, my trust in the policy makers goes down drastically.\n[/quote]\n\nBreaking news: science *also* is very, very far from perfect. \"Perfect\" is not on the menu. You know it, I know it. \n\nThat said, the science here is in Lancet's (and other journals') retractions. It is unfair to complain to \"science\" because the media misreport stuff. Also, I am frankly surprised that you are surprised. Misreporting is endemic. It was around before either of us were born, and we had to develop navigation tools around them. Using them is more effective than complaining. \n\n What it comes down to: intelligent people, like me, do not \"move like automatons\". We pick our readings. I, too, cited some of my sources. Occasionally I even read medical papers. Since I have a PhD in quantitative economics, I understand statistics, and I am a bit better than average in interpreting quantitative results (pro tip: \"to increase death\" is a poor formulation). And I certainly don't get my salient facts from Facebook and YouTube videos. Come on, man! Really? We have known it's tainted at least since 2016. If you want a bibliography for that, I will be happy to oblige.\n\nI run a high risk of picking the wrong sources, and missing out on the right ones. But then, so do you. It's life. If you, given your readings, want to go for hydroxycloroquine, more power to you. We stand to learn from what your actions. Will you treat me, and the rest of us, with the same courtesy?\n\n[quote=\"jasen_lakic, post:34, topic:14462\"]\nLet\u2019s take a subject like race superiority:\nWhat happens if you censor the discussion about it?

The article is filled with indications of social patterns that are incoherent, double-standards and lack relevance. Intimacy has been drained of purpose, it becomes an empty ritual that simply doesn't make sense. To me intimacy is both an inward and outward movement though it the inward part is often missed. Maybe what we are witnessing in Japan is a purposeful redirection of intimacy inwards?\n\nWhat if this is part of a much larger picture that is just beginning to unfold. What if this is one of many expressions on a planetary scale of induced degrowth that is critical to the welfare of this ecosystem we call Earth? Just this morning I came across this article (see Japan reference at the end): <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/books/review/countdown-by-alan-weisman.html\">\"There are too many people\"</a>\n\nand for further reflection ... in stark contrast (or same underlying vibe?) check out this article [Matthias] sent out on twitter in recent weeks: <a href=\"http://www.aeonmagazine.com/living-together/why-young-women-in-rural-china-become-the-mistresses-of-wealthy-older-men/\">Why young women in rural China become the mistresses of wealthy older men</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-21 04:44:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:43.509899", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 242, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29468], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50134, "user_id": 4793, "topic_id": 9365, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![Kocyba%20Falanga%20i%20FN|690x461](upload://11U2iU5Qy6rRD8mONMXUJh9vMJE.jpeg) \n\n###Why are you here?\n\n\nI am concerned about the rise of right-wing populism, not only professionally, but also personally. As an anthropologist, I am trying to figure out how people\u2019s understandings of the world influence their political affiliations and actions. Particularly I want to learn more about the rising popularity of various forms of illiberalism and populism. But this interest has a powerful personal dimension. Like all families in Eastern Europe, my parents and grandparents had suffered tremendously during WWII and I grew up surrounded by the tortured memories of the horror inflicted on the people by the earlier versions of right wing populism, fascism, Nazis, and the Stalinist communism, all version of illiberal, non-democratic systems. I worry about my children; I do not want them to experience what my parents had to go through.\n\n###What are you interested in?\n\nI am dreaming about finding a place for myself among those who want to make the world a more friendly, open, and tolerant place. I would like to be useful, outside of my routine, job-related tasks of researching and teaching. I am trained to study the workings of culture and would like to figure out as many ways as possible to help change culture in the direction of more openness and mutual understanding. Our work with Edgeryders promises to provide a place to engage with many people, understand better how they think and form their views, particularly collectively. I am interested in devising effective ways of helping people to overcome their fears, that often drive them to accept extreme views and solutions, and to be abls to challenge at least some  biases, stereotypes, and prejudices that drive their thinking.\n\n###What are you struggling with?\n\nI am struggling with two kinds of anxiety. The first one is related to the growing aggressiveness of public life in many countries, particularly the two I have close links with: the US and Poland. It is diffuse yet exasperating. The second has its roots in the frequent feeling of being overwhelmed by too many responsibilities, by being engaged in too many projects. The paradox is that this over-commitment is also an effective method of dealing with the first anxiety.", "created_at": "2019-01-18 10:19:57.851822", "updated_at": "2019-03-04 14:14:36.274653", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 377, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 153.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904, 4, 3, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64118, "user_id": 4640, "topic_id": 11397, "post_number": 3, "raw": "The search for social position is not what \"our system has become\" -- it is what human beings do -- take a look at Thorstein Veblen's famous book \"The Theory of the Leisure Class\" from 1898.

So many good points I can hardly keep track.\n\n>Let\u2019s say Facebook releases a new algorithm on a billion people, we could introduce certain requirements. I think that\u2019s kind of a basic step. You have some key criteria, you have some transparency, and documentation requirements about how the systems work, what it\u2019s trying to maximize.\n\n> how the systems work, what it's trying to maximize.\n\nThis is what they are not going to tell us no matter what. This to them is like the recipe for Coca Cola.  But it is the thing we most need to see, because otherwise a more honest title for the business might be RatMaze.  You can poke around here and there but ultimately you are going to go where they want you to go.\n\nYou spoke of the \"self reinforcing loop\" up there.  I was thinking about this same thing through many of the paragraphs prior to you naming it.  You also named part of the problem that contributes to this loop when you said that government doesn't understand the technology, or words to that effect.\n\nI think part of the reason why this is true is because government workers and tech people are usually two different kinds of people.  Neither the government worker or the private sector, usually engineer, person is smarter than the other one. Rather, one - the private sector programmer or engineer tends to be more of a risk taker and the government person tends to be more stability seeking.\n\nI know this might seem like an over simplification, and maybe it is. But what informs me in this comes not so much from a government perspective, but from years i spent managing a digital media project for a large privately owned newspaper and TV company in the San Francisco Bay Area during the height of the dotcom boom of the 90s.  \"Privately owned\" meant that I could not offer stock options for my \"startup\" (which was a very cutting edge media project for that time), only good salaries and benefits (important in the US where there is no govt healthcare) and stability.  So I had to seek out those kinds of people.  Almost all the seriously inventive programmers and project people I knew - and I knew a good number of them from the years I spent in online community management - wanted the higher stakes poker tables of silicon valley where their work could bring them the chance of big paydays but also they could be on the street anytime.  These are the makers. The stability seekers tend to be more comfortable mediating between the makers and the rest of society in one way or another.  That keeps the public happy and wanting the stuff.  So tech has a big self reinforcing loop going right there.\n\nSame with cyber security where often the ones who commit the crimes wind up working for the government after they pay their debt to society so to speak and are thus watched all the time anyway.  My point is, in addition to all the other complicating factors, the dynamic between these two types of people/workers is part of it too.", "created_at": "2019-11-18 18:25:30.231579", "updated_at": "2019-11-18 18:25:30.231579", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 548, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 142.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67087, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12133, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![communitycalls%20logo%2010th%20dec|690x488](upload://nAC5Q7VkWOC5XFQOiJFm3mycYQF.png) \nComing together for Collective Intelligence!\n\n**After the festival, we are back to topical community calls!**\n\nSince **\"Collective Intelligence\"** has been a big topic the last few days and also offers us the opportunity to explain Edgeryders Semantic Social Network Analysis a bit we decided to make this the topic of the next call on Tuesday the 10th of December.\n\n**Looking forward to seeing you 10th of DEC, 18:00-19:00 Brussels time at: [https://zoom.us/j/489971765 ](https://zoom.us/j/489971765)**\n\nIf you want calendar reminders, please download and import the following iCalendar (.ics) files to your calendar system.\nWeekly: [https://zoom.us/meeting/uZwkfu6pqT0vVYoNECnUgDF3EfwNQ2Fjhg/ics?icsToken=98tyKu2gpzItG9OTtVztRa0vA9r9b8-xlEd3pY14vxHQBAR1MSbwIcxzYJR1GN-B ](https://zoom.us/meeting/uZwkfu6pqT0vVYoNECnUgDF3EfwNQ2Fjhg/ics?icsToken=98tyKu2gpzItG9OTtVztRa0vA9r9b8-xlEd3pY14vxHQBAR1MSbwIcxzYJR1GN-B)\n\nPlease ping community members that you would like to join the call and send the link to others in your network who are interested in the topic :slight_smile:\n\n@lylycarrillo, for example, agreed to introduce her perspective in 5 minutes for this call, I will quickly present the SSNA, do some other members of the community and maybe specifically theses discussions also present something?\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/open-collective-intelligence-labs-call-for-mentors/11661\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/applying-for-the-h2020-collective-intelligence-call-looking-for-operational-partners-and-collaborators/11974\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/collective-intelligence-in-edgeryders-the-big-picture-seven-years-on/10113 \n\nAlso, from now onwards, as mentioned we are going back to topical community calls.

He and @simonaferlini are thinking of a new bottom-up initiative. Through me, they are asking Edgeryders for help. Marco \u2013 a doctor \u2013 and Simona \u2013 a public health manager \u2013 both in Italy, are on the frontlines, so I am going to do the writing here.\n\n**It turns out that the health care system, in many countries (but not in all), got overoptimized over the years**. It was honed to be efficient in the context of a predictable environment, with a known mix of pathologies. Over time, it discarded redundancies and second lines. It is now badly equipped to deal with unknown unknowns and black swan events. \n\n**Overoptimization also happened in agent space**. Not only hospital wards not running at full capacity were closed: the people who got promoted to leadership positions in public health tended to be narrow specialists, who build their career on, say, hepatitis B. Their epistemic horizon is *also* made for stable environments. They do not know how to move in an epistemic space where evidence is absent, or ambiguous; they are not used to questioning evidence, and dislike doing so. \n\nThe result was a situation where *evidence from China was not sifted and interrogated, but mistrusted*. As a result, many countries in Europe underestimated SARS-CoV-2 (\"mortality is like a flu's\", which is of course true *if you have the resources to treat every affected person to high standards*). At this point, in Marco's reconstruction, the whole system went into emergency mode. The emergency, plus the epistemic rigidity, mean that the protocols that are being communicated to doctors on the frontline are shaky at best, and \"magical thinking\" at worst. Ward directors and even government guidelines (Italy) will tell doctors to \"keep working on patients *even if you test positive, as long as you asymptomatic*\" (!!!), or to wear makeshift masks if you do not have any proper ones \"because they are better than nothing\". Intensive care wards are being erected in a few days, by reconverting space from, say, psychiatric ones. Additionally \u2013 and this is very, very serious \u2013 there are strong suspicion that actual data are being hidden or misrepresented. Hidden: I have some personal evidence, as the open data community in Italy (@napo, @piersoft) is desperately asking regional authorities to release the data with open licenses and proper documentation. Misrepresented: it turns out that, in places like Bergamo, only 10-25% of the extra mortality with respect to seasonally adjusted average is explained by the official deaths by COVID-19. It's hard to really figure out what is going on, also because shifting criteria of access to testing ([Italian](https://www.adnkronos.com/fatti/cronaca/2020/03/28/coronavirus-medici-lombardia-dati-inattendibili-per-nascondere-caporetto_zDgE6wbV5lCsiojvwsSGpK.html)) mean that there is no way to even observe the statistical trends.\n\n**Epistemic resilience means, instead, being critical of evidence, and disobeying if that saves lives or unnecessary suffering**. In the case of masks, we *do* have evidence: a makeshift mask is to a mask what a blanket it to a parachute. It is not \"better than nothing\", it is exactly the same as nothing. A makeshift hospital ward might have intensive care machines, but it risks infecting patients in nearby wards *unless air circulation is addressed seriously, with proper ventilation and filters*, which is a feature distinguishing makeshift wards from proper ones. Plus, these things might create a false sense of security \u2013 again, we have a literature on this, more from finance and from war medicine \u2013 and distract us from taking measures that, while far from optimal, are indeed \"better than nothing\". Example: isolate people at home, and send them cheap DIY ventilators or some such. \n\nMarco and Simona think that epistemic resilience for the medical community means three things.\n\n1. **Build a trusted knowledge base** on practices to deploy in the face of the evidence we have, and that we do not. Right now, doctors are getting advice off YouTube channels, and randos on WhatsApp. Some solid stuff is there, but also people who say the government has created SARS-CoV-2 to kill all the NoVax. I think of this knowledge base as the kind of document that @matthias and @lucasg are good at maintaining. This is necessary, because in the face of bad instructions doctors and nurses need some evidence-based good knowledge to push back. This need is why they are all on WhatsApp. Marco thinks this would consist both of articles and of stories from the frontlines.

It would be tempting to just add a text field asking people where they come from, but it turns out the clean way to do this is to run mapping modules that geocode correctly that information. I found a recent <a href=\"https://drupal.org/node/1704948\">comparison of mapping modules</a> on the Drupal website. Earlier this year I did a seminar on geodata. The teacher advocated Leaflet (visualizes against OpenStreetMap instead of Google Maps, which is probably better for Edgeryders commitment to openness); apparently, installing the Leaflet module you get an option in Views to output the view as a map. Sweet!\n\nI am asking around for a recommendation as to which modules to use.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-31 21:35:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:27.807082", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 144, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12519, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 2564, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>UI quirks</b>\n\nOk, it seems we have to fix some UI issues before inviting more people.\n\nSome explanations about how it's meant to be: your surprise that you can't give a price when creating a \"wish\" might perhaps be because the word \"wishlist\" implied for you that it's a public list, something like want ads. It was meant more like your own shopping list (non-public). Maybe we should rename it.\n\nAnyway, your idea to make wishes public to motivate people to offer something they have around seems good. For building up the initial set of offers it's great even. Later, when there's everything to be found like on eBay now, it might no longer be needed (and could even be exploited for push-marketing maybe). I can imagine a feature that would let users see services without offers and say \"I want this\"; and similar for products by creating a \"wish\" with indicative bid price and requirements. Sellers can then browse through open wishes and say \"Offer this\", which generates a notification for the users with registered wishes and adds them to their respective wish in \"Shopping -&gt; My Wishlist\" (still inactive though, as users need to decide if they trust the supplier enough to order).\n\nAbout the \"market\" word: your concern seems legit. We <em>want</em> symmetry between buying and selling parts, so it could be renamed to \"Go shopping!\", and adding \"Go selling!\" in the other menu.\n\nFor creating a service, an \"Offer this\" link is on our to-do list. For now, <a href=\"http://www.makerfox.com/services/new\">creating a service</a> (in \"Selling -&gt; My Offers -&gt; Services -&gt; +\") like you tried is the way to go. (Type \"subtitling\" into the category / service selection box to make it filter down to include the service you want to offer.)\n\nBTW, the categories field is a (pretty cool) AJAX based filter field: start typing, and you get other results than those starting with A / B. But we found that two category levels are sufficient, so they could be later selected in a two-column hierarchical selectbox. Current product categories were taken over from some dataset, but I need to replace it completely because it's not the right thing for the maker economy ...\n\nOk then, thanks for the initial testing, my teammate will care for the issues.

I'm an open source guy (well, actually a Free guy, to use Stallman's Distinction, but more pepole understand Open Source than Free these days!).\n\n<a href=\"http://star-tides.net\">http://star-tides.net </a>was the major output of that process. It's a big open clearing house for disaster relief information and an ongoing conversation about those issues of sharing and cooperation between a variety of miliary, civilian and state actors. They do really good work.\n\nNow we're in a rather interesting situation. Open Data and Open Government go closely together but it's also blurring ownershp of certain types of capability. A really simple example is searching government web sites: people use Google. But the government doesn't own Google, and neither do the people: the most advanced user of the goverment's data is actually a private company, which is now providing a service to the public based on government data, but not actually accountable. Although *in theory* the Public could build something to replace Google for searching their data, in practice that's not happening.\n\nIn the case of novel applications, where there's a possibility of patenting a method or an application which runs on top of publid data to produce a proprietary-and-non-replaceable service, Open Data starts to export capability from the State to the Market in a way which we've found, historically speaking, is Unhelpful.\n\n<strong>So (and excuse the length of my preamble) here's my question: do we need to mandate that Open Data can only be used in Open Source applications to prevent proprietary applications basically renting the public's own data back to them, with patent coverage to prevent competition?</strong>\n\nOr is that an issue we don't have to face at the moment?

Please also note that we could very plausibly be wading into a huge horror scenario anyway, and a more or less reflected nuke industry might not make a big dent. \n\nIn my book however, a desperation and wishful thinking driven nuclear industry would very much hold the potential to turn a 500 year fuck-up (moderately good CO2 scenario) into a something approximately 100 times as bad and 100 as long.

I beleive that this is the path I need to follow, but also feel the pressure of time.

I looked again through all free software QDA applications I could find, installed and tested some, and I like RQDA best now. It's the application that we also used as export target for the Open Ethnographer prototype, and I still have the script I used back then. So except you're far in with this task, maybe I can take it over and implement an export to RQDA instead?\n\nMy reasons for RQDA:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong><em>Not</em> web-based.</strong> In text analysis, the delays in CATMA are very annoying for productive work. I originally searched for a web-based tool to allow live syncing, but did not realize how annoying the delays are (and the inability to use it offline).</li>\n\n<li><strong>SQLite file format.</strong> Which is great to handle for exporting to / downloading / archiving. Unlike CATMA's multi-file XML stuff.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Single-user data structures.</strong> What annoyed me most in CATMA is its uber-complex UI and concept structuring, coming mostly from trying to support multi-user / collaborative work, and from bad UI design. We completely don't need these multi-user features, since in our case Open Ethnographer is for the collaborative part, and text analysis (everything after the exports) is every ethnographer's own business. RQDA has a much simpler UI because it targets such a single-user analysis scenario.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Better handling of query complexity.</strong> In CATMA, they have a kind of proprietary query language that however misses some basic features (for example, there is no way to search for all tags at once, so no quotation manager feature; and even if there was, the search result presentation does not provide enough context to read vertically).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI am not against having CATMA export at some point in the future, but for now I think RQDA is much more appropriate.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-07 02:10:48", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:46.250239", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 376, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79358, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13414, "post_number": 36, "raw": "I am adding my comment on first generation academics from the call to this thread: I am from a rural area and in fact most of the people I graduated school (A-levels) with (as myself), were the first in their families to go on to university. 10 Years after starting our studies, getting good academic jobs seems often to have to do with connections and confidence, both of which a lot of first generation academics lack. We also do not have guidance and reaffirmation to go on in that direction from our families. What I have observed is many of us defaulting to other or administrative work after their studies, unable to break into the next level.\n\nMaybe it is not a coincidence that the economical situation of especially young academics has become worse while there have also come more first generation academics who are not aware what to demand, what would be the best career moves and how to protect their rights.", "created_at": "2020-06-22 16:20:39.944132", "updated_at": "2020-06-22 16:20:39.944132", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 164, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 37.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 3816], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70748, "user_id": 5667, "topic_id": 12733, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Great!

We don't do counts and there is not really a decision making process for these principles to come into the world, rather they are formulated on the basis of common practice and leadership and insights from their author. They have an overarching vision behind it - and that is as simple as freedom in my books :slight_smile:\n\nMany times, it could be that depending on who you ask in Edgeryders company or community you might get different answers and we kind of decided a while back that it is ok, in fact it is desirable that it is like that. \nNot sure if what @hugi told you and how this post reflects his message (I'm actually curious!), but the closer you are and working on daily operations in edgeryders, chances are these get instilled easier.. so I think Hugi sees it in a pretty compatible way.  \n\nThe good thing is that while these are the lived reality in our company (much more than a manifesto or rulebook), they dont need to be formalised for the entire community. After all, we are 4500 + people from all over with very different levels of engagement in edgeryders. All we can do, those of us who are more involved, is try to grow the culture and that means it will evolve continuously.\n\nTo give you an example - in 2013 we were more along [these principles for community -company](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-as-social-enterprise-what-you-can-do-with-it/1044), a little more loose and free as I re-read them and think with hindsight.

The use of up-voting &amp; down-voting to improve answer-finding (specifically) is proven to be effective in the real world by excellent and long-running sites such as those in the StackExchange family; in concert with a context (the video), this is a force to be reckoned with.

In a traditional lecture, there is a need for the lecturer to 'fill their slot' exactly to the allocated time for which they have the lecture theatre.

We and many of those I talked to want to travel less in the upcoming year and in a project with Climate KIC, Edgeryders works on recommendations for people how to improve remote collaborations to decrease the need for travel.\n\nI believe that one of the reasons that online remote work is sometimes perceived as insufficient or lacking in social aspects and the need for travel arising from that is that we have not yet consciously grasp the characteristics and needs of each channel and learn social cues, conventions and strategies to use those channels best.\n\n**Certain signals are heightened or dampened in a video call or chat in comparison to a direct conversation. We need to learn new conventions and \"Best Practises\" for those channels.**\n\n\nTherefore I want to ask you here for your stories, experiences and ideas:\n\n**For example: Compensating social signals/interactions by including personal aspects in professional virtual meetings.**\n\n> During our Edgeryders team calls the cats or children of teammembers sometimes walk by and are then introduced to us. I feel that this makes the atmosphere in the video call more direct and relaxed. \"Professionalism\" could have different boundaries and faces in this channel. If I do mainly meet my coworkers via such a channel, I actually appreciate if their pets or children come by or if they share something about private projects they are pursuing, because this makes them more human and real to me.\n\n\n**It is also easier to remember and connect community members that have jined in the Comunity calls or told more about their concrete histories, experiences and personalities in their introductions and their profiles gain resolution, depth and therefore reality and memorability. We want you to share your personal stories here instead of just a research report or project pitch because those personal details are what enable us to connect more deeply even when discussing and collaborating remotely asynchronous. The internet of humans has to find ways to allow for and use the developed cognitive ability of the human brain to make social connections.**\n\n\n* ***Which methods and moments have made remote collaboration and communication richer for you?***\n#\n#\n \n**I would also appreciate your opinion on how to deal with workload management and reporting in a remote and asynchronous collaboration architecture:**\n\nWhen you are responsible for contributing to multiple different aspects of different projects with collaborators that are based in different places and systems it is hard for you and them to gage your workload. We have to heavily rely on self-reporting, which in itself is a management skill one needs to learn. \n\n* How do you estimate and keep track of your workload?\n\n* How do you communicate it to your collaborators who can not see the bags under your eyes or you frantically typing away in the corner of the office?\n\n* How should we remind each other of the tasks we committed to?\n\n> If you would work in the same office, just seeing your colleague over there would maybe already remind you to finish that job for them you committed to. If you do not see them you might forget. If they keep reminding you via chat it can build up anxiety, especially if the messages come in constantly (even weekends).\n\n* What are good ways to remind each other of what needs to be done?\n\n**Please share examples of when remote collaboration/interaction worked especially well for you or what definitely not to do :slight_smile:**\n\n*Let's develop those new social conventions for remote communication and collaboration together :).*", "created_at": "2019-12-06 13:37:51.996698", "updated_at": "2019-12-11 15:51:39.903465", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 802, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 246.4, "like_count": 9, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5538, 4022, 2915, 5698, 5, 4265, 2551, 5201, 5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54592, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 10064, "post_number": 30, "raw": "Here's mine kocian@fsv.cuni.cz", "created_at": "2019-06-05 16:00:59.780983", "updated_at": "2019-06-05 16:00:59.780983", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [54573], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76466, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13448, "post_number": 9, "raw": "No, I disagree with the assessment.

Where we depart is mostly in that I emphasise interdependence from future and potential brethren, whereas most Matera veterans draw a line at the House and at the people who they can speak to over breakfast. The departure is not trivial: it means I think of brethren as a network, which have no in-out borders but rather a gradient of centrality; and you think of brethren-ness as a category, you are either in or out. Furthermore, it means I think of \"being an unMonasterian\" as an\u00a0<em>identity,</em>\u00a0whereas I think of it as a\u00a0<em>behaviour.</em>\u00a0For me it's just that I do not like to stick labels on people, because <a href=\"http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html?goback=.gde_1838701_member_179729766\">ontology is overrated</a>.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-08-22 10:44:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:15.836714", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 368, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73580, "user_id": 206, "topic_id": 13089, "post_number": 28, "raw": "Sounds like a worthy conversation to have.

So as to ensure that these attributes and stories are carried into a new civilisation.\n\nIt came to mind yesterday during the Scifi Economics Lab. Both when Cory spoke of fully automated luxury communism and when Kirsten spoke of new narratives. I would argue that a not insignificant part of narrative building is tied to place. It's easy to disregard the deep ties that people have to a place and the stories tied to it...\n\nHow these narratives can carry people through rough times due to a sense of being a community of fate. The rituals, again tied to place and people, which everyone of the place has internalised often have the role of weaving together communities. The older they are, the more thoroughly they are grounded in your person - because of childhood memories etc. A solid common ground. \n\nIt's all good and well to talk of larger causes, or your choice of tribes. But how does that work when your people include family members in different parts of the world? How strong is the sense of common fate as a motivator for sticking together when conflicting loyalties and multiple stories arise?\n\nWhen you are part of an ethnic group and community of fate, yes you have some feud going on with your neighbours but when militia come for you or attempt to displace you, it's a common fight. Also because you have relatives in common etc. \n\nHow this is linked to doing tech for good? 24 hours a day requires focus.\n\nWhat technosocial developments that it makes sense to put your energy fighting for will depend on whom you are fighting for. And what rights you can rely on - e.g how large is the probability that if you are arrested you will be kicked out of a country?  \n\nDo you focus on introducing and building capacity around use of certain technologies for the local good? Are you fighting nationally to get Microsoft out of your educational system.

As you know, publishing open research data is a requirement under Horizon 2020, and even if it were not I would like to do it anyway. I want to do it myself, because most academics are not invested in the publication of open data, and tend to play fast and loose, not document datasets and accompanying code properly, and so on.\n\nThere are two set of problems that the tools need to address.\n\n## 1. How close to graph form?\n\nSSNs are graphs; the whole interpretive framework is based on this. But the Discourse DB thinks in tables, not in graphs. Hence, graphs for SSNA require external software to build and navigate them. \n\nGiven this, when we store data we can do two things. \n\n* We could just export an \"as is\" dump of the relevant part of the DB in JSON form, and leave it to the future user to re-assemble it in graph form.\n* We could \"pre-cook\" our data dump into a graph-ready form. For example, you would have a JSON file encoding nodes (users), and another one encoding edges (interactions). This makes it super easy to build a graph with any software. I would probably stick to JSON as a format; storing data in graph format (like GraphML or Tulip) won't make the work of the re-user much easier, and those formats might even put off some people, since they are far less universal than JSON.\n\nThis choice implies a choice of investment in possible audiences of re-users. Code-literate folks do not have many problems going from tabular data to graphs. Guy, or Bruno, or Ben could code up a script in less than an hour. But then there are people like me, from a social sciences background but with some coding skills; and humanities researchers who *use* software, but do not code. @amelia, do you have any recommendations here? Are there people out there who would consider re-using our data but might be put off by the idea of having to re-assemble them into graph form?\n\n## 2. Pseudonymizing\n\nThis is something I have never done. \n\nI understand the minimum requirements we must meet are the following. Matthias, can you confirm? \n\n* the data do not contain any username\n* the user IDs are scrambled (user IDs are accessible to anyone via API call).\n\nI would do this in the following way: \n\n1. Loop over usernames.\n2.

Most complex challenges (like getting food on the table for your family from a hundred sources and locations), are not one well-defined problem (grow apples), but a constellation of interdependent issues (transportation logistics, factory sorting and processing, demand & supply negotiations, regulation etc) undergoing constant redefinition and renegotiation. Any one organisation, no matter how efficient and smart, has no hope of containing any such challenge.\n\nAt the same time we see that in the face of large shocks to the system, organisations optimised for efficiency and profit cannot provide the means for material, relational, and existential resilience of neither individual nor society at large. Case in point: When supply chains are broken, even benevolent governments in affluent countries cannot access the equipment or protective gear to protect frontline workers on which we all depend to stay alive.\n\nOn the other hand, communities are getting smarter. The Internet has produced decentralized, scalable tools for coordination, archiving, and retrieval. It has also spawned cultural practices and ethical rules that incentivize people to collaborate with strangers. As a result, leaderless \u201cswarms\u201d of dedicated citizen experts are writing encyclopedias, mapping the Earth, doing science, developing and maintaining complex, successful software stacks. In each of these areas they outperform powerful businesses and government initiatives.\n\nThese initiatives display uncanny speed and efficiency, because communities are better than organizational hierarchies at making use of human intelligence. They treat every person \u2013 not just the top echelon \u2013 as a potential or actual expert, rather than as a passive consumer or beneficiary. They ask people to help, rather than charting their needs, and they have more human talent to throw at problems. They weed out under-performing initiatives in a healthy and natural way, making way for new life to emerge.\n\nWikipedia\u2019s a good example of the combined power of Smart Swarms to change the world. We all use it every day, and it\u2019s taking effective action on both poverty (poor people are using it too, all over the world!) and ecology (it\u2019s saving huge numbers of trees on paper books.) People are working together to solve a real human problem - access to knowledge - and it\u2019s improving everyone\u2019s lives. There\u2019s a tiny thread of financial capital \u2013 running the servers, say \u2013 but Wikipedia is a community-driven enterprise. It shows what can be done.\n\nWe want to achieve resilient lives and livelihoods. Contributing to Wikipedia doesn\u2019t put food on the table or ensure that communities support one another to mitigate the consequences of social distancing. Or even keep our mental health intact when automation wipes out the need for many professions, the foundation on which many of us build our identity and sense of purpose. We need to use a similar kind of effect to meet the material, relational, and existential needs of individuals and communities. And we need to develop sources of prosperity that secure their resilience by serving these needs.\n\nThis is not just semantics: it is about reframing livelihood generation from a lonely, competitive activity that only is accessible if you have money to sustain yourself while you build your business or have specialised training. To one that is collaborative, mutualistic, and accessible to all, regardless of your personal background. We frame the building of sustainable economic livelihoods as that of building an ecosystem, made up of many overlapping circles of people engaging in different activities. Commercial activity always relied on cooperation more than competition (but that was called an old boys club).\n\nThis summit is part of a series of activities aimed at co-designing experimental new social, business and investment models to withstand the shocks which will besoon be upon us as climate crisis and ecological devastation unfold. Ecosystems of economic resilience and regeneration.\n\n### Tactics and technologies\n\nEcosystems are not designed: they evolve. We do not start from scratch. We focus on accelerating the evolution of the ecosystem of already existing movements, social innovations, businesses and policies. We:\n\n* Start with \u201cviable mutants\u201d. We identify suitable initiatives that have achieved tangible initial progress. Many are already known to us through our extended networks.\n* Provide conditions for expansion. We fund a scaled-up deployment of each initiative.\n* Speed up the rates of adaptation. We push initiatives out in the field early, encouraging prototyping and rapid learning. Knowledge sharing practices borrowed from open source developers enable initiatives to imitate each other\u2019s tactics, further speeding up adaptation.\n* Promote niche discovery and colonization. Knowledge sharing institutions are a natural venue for initiatives to trade with each other. This promotes specialization into emerging niches in the ecosystem and enriches it.\n* Enforce natural selection. Initiatives that fail to complete any step of the process are dropped. Initiatives are encouraged and supported to become self-supporting by the end of the process.\n* The technology that supports this evolution is the Edgeryders stack: an online platform, community management and open source digital tools to enable meaningful dialogue and distributed collaboration at scale.\n* Finally we document and disseminate the results widely, seeking to challenge the prevailing narrative of how successful business ventures and ecosystems are born and sustained.\n\n### How you can partner with us\n\nWe need you to partner with us around this effort.\n\n* People who run pension funds. We will give you new options for how you can lessen dependence of your investment models on complex supply chains.\n* People leading trade unions, and their members. We will help you to pressure governance institutions to experiment alternative economic development and livelihood models with an emphasis on resilience.\n* Leaders of public administrations, with focus on specific cities and regions.

The camp, funded by [Advocate Europe](https://advocate-europe.eu/en), offered a rare occasion to 30 something activists to slow down and reflect on our work; with yoga, meditation, ecstatic dance intermissions (sic!), and no hard commitment to produce an artefact by the end. One could wander and ponder about whether pairing people with radically different political worldviews changes their civic behavior, but also chat about good apps for practicing mindfulness (I hear it\u2019s Headspace).\n \nOf 40 people around the camp, about half of us were \u201cparticipants\u201d, while the other half were organisers and hosts, an extensive team affiliated to Open State and the place.\n \nIt was the Place which really made my camp experience. With scarce Internet and mobile signal, vague appearances of machines, we found ourselves in a nature park with a history, at a two-hour train ride en route from Berlin to Hamburg. Wir Bauen Zukunft (translates We Build Future) aka \u201cthe Nieklitz crew\u201d is a collective that in the beginning of 2016 bought 18 hectares of land with a loan from a generous private person. This was previously a biology park, a multi million euro technical project of a local architect in the late 90s which failed to bring in enough visitors or people to fill spacious workshops. The ensemble had severely deprecated  due to lack of maintenance and use. Since 2016, the Nieklitz crew rebuilt most of it, with a lot of attention for craft and design. It is quite an experience to walk between The Hive main hall and kitchen, the Scent House and House of Flowers, all equipped with a few dozen beds, toilets, indoor and outdoor shower(s); or to walk the green paths between large workshops and storage spaces, old trailers, camping and camp fire spots. See it for yourself:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3f4c0888d2f8c861fc8f89afbab99701066494c6.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n_The Hive is the hq, with event space, kitchen/dining area and living quarters too_\n \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cf2a73de0dc7b8d6cd5a2245565b8619e379bf27.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n_Main hall and dining area_\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/75785093307ee64ef5f605c647290e84bb1b5fa5.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n_The Flower House_\n \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6c4de96ff92eeece3635863971f1b6442a8e729a.jpg\" width=\"388\" height=\"690\">\n_The Scent House_\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/77291809ab0150732b94e9c24458325747f87c3d.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\">\n_The outdoor shower (CC-BY-SA - Open State)_\n\nIt is my understanding that the group works for Earth sustainability, with a mission of co-working in nature (the lack of working Internet was temporary). They partially use geotermal energy (underground pipes for heating); research water efficient biogas stoves (to work through methanization); plan an upcoming earthship; organise renovation and building camps on the land. All these build up a sustainable space, with awareness that \u201ceverything we produce we need to sell\u201d, as someone said to me. All would then call for how-to innovation workshops, for others to learn how to do it. They also host organisations/ events to make temporary use of the space, and encourage deeper exchange: permaculture meetings would teach everyone new practices, while experimenting on the Nieklitz land. Like most skilled communities I have seen, the boundaries between those who host and those who cross their path are purposefully blurred.\n \nIt also reflects in the group\u2019s structure. Formally, it is a cooperative (in German the legal term is genossenschaft) where members buy-in an amount of 5K to co-own the property. There are 18-20 of them, with many active supporters - Open State itself has contributed large share of the camp funding to equip the space for future uses. About 10 people also live in the space, putting their time and skills into servicing it, but needing to make ends meet in the real world still.\n\nI asked everyone I got the chance about their involvement and how the community develops. The points below are valuable takeaways for me and hopefully for edgeryders[ OpenVillage](http://openvillage.edgeryders.eu) in-the-making:\n\n**1. Reaching out to fitting partners in a strategic way.** Securing the resources to get started involved 3 questions: What\u2019s the topic? Who\u2019s around to partner up with? Where does the money come from? It could be that the OpenVillage solves 2) and 3) by being hosted temporarily in a community whose values are aligned, which has the space for us: could be an industrial park, an eco-village, a farmland and so on.\n\n**2. Time set aside for planning, group structuring and reflection.** The core group had known each other for about 3 years prior and intersected in various projects. The cooperative model looks promising because in it, members share clear rights, but they also share the responsibility in a way that doesn\u2019t break the structure when someone drops out. Everyone participates in weekly meetings and they apply sociocracy 3.0 to all decision making. Reportedly, it is not easy, but the collective understands that it\u2019s a process and gets help when needed (professional coaches).\n\n**3. A healthy mix of working, living, and the space in between** In the Nieklitz group, I found a surprising combination of brain meets the heart meets the hands. It is not a hackerspace with living quarters, nor is it a hippie commune. Or if it is any of them, it escaped me, as I was talking to such diverse people - designers, artists, cooks, planners and highly skilled builders. The space reflects that: as part of the package one can try three different kinds of showers \u2013 the inside shower, the outside shower, and the love shower :-)\n \nMy own questions about making a life for oneself lingered. It seemed that the deep personal investment of people is not only in making a project happen. Someone I spoke to framed it as having a chance to live the lives we want, outside the oppression experienced in the city. Wir Bauen Zukunft and their extended loving arms like Open State are building future, in much needed radical, but gentle ways. Chapeau!\n \n_Thank you so much Anja, Lale, Laurent, Kyra, Felix, Kari, Cristoph, Ele and everyone for the time we spent together.

The notes are specifically from the \"technical group\"'s work in the group session, of which I was a part.*\n\nThe question that we discussed \u2013 from various angles \u2013 was: How can we make buildings more ecologically sustainable? Relates to building materials, household appliances, the inhabitants' \"behavior of living\" etc.. Notes by contributor:\n\n**Malcolm:**\n\n* Influenced by Brent and Robert Vale's book \"The Autonomous House\", an influential book in the 1970s. They approached a house as an input / output device. An \"earthbound spacecraft\" that should be self-sufficient. They thought about the flows going in and out: air, water, sewage etc.. And then how to minimize the flows.\n\n* The capital consumption (embodied energy etc.) to build a perfect building has to be considered when thinking if a building is ecological or not. (Comment by Ilaria: That's the basic idea of circular economy.)\n\n* Insulation: Usually you'd first insulate, then heat (as much as still needed). But there are challenges: Adding wall insulation on the outside of existing buildings is a problem. Because it may inhibit windows from working. And if you add insulation on the inside, the thermal mass of the building is of not much use for keeping the room temperature constant.\n\n* Directly heating buildings with wind turbines would work. It's the same hydraulic brake technology as on aircraft carriers, where the jet capture wire has to be slowed down rapidly.\n\n* In older years, hot fill dishwashers and washing machines were standard. Not anymore. Reason? The policy seems to be an all-electrical energy supply now. At least in Belgium.\n\n* When teaching physics in school, Malcolm asks children the ethics of moving from slaves to power tools and robots. A power tool is like having 20 servants. Even music was non-electric 200 years ago. Not anymore.\n\n* Should we employ people to clean the place, or do that with robots? This is an interesting moral question. Cleaners nowadays are annoyed if they have no automated equipment \u2013 even if offered pay for longer hours of work in compensation.\n\n* Resource hint: \"Center for Alternative Technolog\", Wales.\n\n* Malcolm has a rainwater system, from the early 20th century; then suddenly it started to stink; even the toilet smelled worse after flushing; the cistern had to be cleaned from the inside; before one could do laundry with it; the FAC website has the equipment for rainwater tech.\n\n**Isabelle:**\n\n* Might converting a building to be green be more expensive than building a new one? (Comment by Malcolm: Even if so, it's also valid to make a conversion as a demonstration project of what can be done.)\n\n* In France, there is a lot of subsidy for insulation etc.. (In Belgium, not so much, according to Malcolm. Due to historical building status, the commune even wanted to have single glazing back in his building at one point.)\n\n* What low-tech solutions are there in order to not be addicted to market-provided high-tech solutions? Because that's needed to really be sufficient with the existing resources.\n\n* Can low-tech solutions work in urban areas?\n\n* Would generating electricity for the building with bicycle generators work? (Comment by Matthias: It's just not enough. If you cycle 24 hours a day, you'd generate 2.4 - 3.6 kWh, out of the 6.5 kWh a typical person uses per day, taking the example of Germany.)\n\n* To be ecological, it also has to be fair. In Isabelle's work with utilizing abandoned buildings, the principle is that everything is based on free contribution, and everything has a value. This is \"ecological relationships\" as the basis.\n\n**Ilaria:**\n\n* Wood burning is polluting. In Milan, they proposed a law that says chimneys can only be used beyond 200 m altitude (\"in the mountains\"). But that got not implemented in the end. A lot of pizzerias would be affected, so they were against it. The problem here was that Milan is in the Padana plain, an industrial region with no wind and mountains around. That creates air pollution issues.\n\n* With open source tech, a lot of things become affordable for everyone.\n\n* Caring for the environment (the culture) is a closed, bourgeois club these days. It costs energy to choose ecological behavior. It has to open up. Changing behavior only happens when you see the value.\n\n* Not everyone has the passion for the environment. People need to see the value for their own lives to engage in ecological behavior.\n\n**Matthias:**\n\n* Behavior setting theory is a nice framework for effecting behavior change by incentives in the physical environment. Could be well integrated into green buildings, as it deals with the connection between behavior and things that we found to be important for low-resource-use living.\n\n* Recourse link: [Low-Tech Magazine](https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/).\n\n**Vincent:**\n\n* The Romans did not achieve the industrial revolution (even though they were short before that) just because they did have slaves, and did not need machine power.\n\n* What are behaviors / rules for common living that make buildings more ecological?\n\n* It's necessary to define to what degree / extremeness you want to be ecological with your building. It's easy to be extreme, in a way. But when it means that the comfort level drops too low, you have to warn people before they join, or visit.", "created_at": "2019-11-19 15:01:02.934257", "updated_at": "2019-12-20 17:17:45.097281", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 892, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 38.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 5698], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74573, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 13222, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Sure, but we'd need first to finish the visualization.

My main goal is to position technology developer in the Research and Innovation ecosystem of Europe so they can develop further themselves. Extremadura is the region where I come from.

However, thanks to that marginalisation we have an extraordinary environment in terms of biodiversity. \nIf I can say something about myself relating my job, it that it is quite a honour to represent a region as mine and working next to the knowledge generators of my regions, the innovator that did not emigrate as many other did to find suitable solution for Extremadura. \nConcerning the question of the doubts that I may be holding at the present moment, some of them are relate to the lack of coordination we face in my organisation which is nobody's faults but it has become a big snow ball. \nBesides, if one day I should leave my job, I am happy to say that technology solutions, the development of rural areas through sustainable bioeconomy, ICT technologies on public services, such as Personalised medicine, are aspects of my current job that I would like to exploit on my next one and share with anybody that it is interested on the same topic (If I am fortunate enough). \nI also, was always quite passionate with reading, and writing. \n\n**Great, now that you've made it easier for us to introduce you to the others \u2013 start to think about the topic and purpose of the event itself.

Namely: you run an analysis with 135K sessions. This encompasses much more than your two months \u2013 my guess is that sessions have been about 15K during that period. So, you are essentiallhy looking at the whole Edgeryders history. And yet, even there, Facebook is bringing home 364 signups, with a conversion rate of 1.85%. The website average is 1.86%.\n\nI run my own analysis on traffic coming from social media in the 15 April-15 June 2014 period. Here it is (click to enlarge):\n\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3066878bf85162b04245f5b1c3f62578954ed3a2.jpg)<br></a>Same story. Significant number of conversions (134 in two months means over two a day); the conversion rate is about the same of the website's average, 2% \u2013 actually nearly 3% for Facebook, less than 1% for Twitter.\n\nIf I try the other significant goal, \"visit at least 4 pages\", I get a similar picture. 1123 conversions in two months, 20 a day, with a conversion rate very similar to the website's average. The number of pages per session is 4.2 for traffic coming from Twitter, and 3.41 for traffic coming from Facebook. That's not bad. I checked the website of a similar project ([http://www.progettokublai.net/](http://www.progettokublai.net/) \u2013 I still have the access to the analytics because I used to direct it) and its average number of pages per visit is 2.51, whereas ours is 3.76. \n\nThat does not mean that social media engagement drives this good stuff, in this I agree with you.

And it is a chance to create a beautiful and welcoming culture at that and one that in my opinion can have even stronger ties, because we choose consciously with whom to stay in contact and when we need to search for new direct contacts in person where we end up. But it also means that we are creating a cultural layer that A: makes it harder for us to relate to the experiences of those who are not part of it and B: might never really live in the culture of the place where we happen to end life but rather mainly stay in this international culture of people moving. \n\nYou probably have a very strong web of very different and carefully chosen people you decided to stay in contact with from a large pool of people you met new in different places and situations and that might be a richness in itself and a web to rely on.", "created_at": "2019-11-12 17:56:17.610769", "updated_at": "2019-11-12 17:56:17.610769", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 281, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 33.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [63641], "is_reply_to": [63641], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41962, "user_id": 4286, "topic_id": 8126, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Hi @Ghassan_faisal, I hope to meet you soon", "created_at": "2018-02-19 15:04:35.348492", "updated_at": "2018-02-19 15:04:35.348492", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 32.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4314], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74642, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13262, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![image|690x690,100%](upload://2g2KgzPv1MlYnGZbe1mOhq5Lj5l.jpeg) \n\nRecent events (including the great [Surveillance Pandemic discussion](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-results-of-the-community-listening-post-on-risks-for-freedom-in-the-wake-of-covid-19/13183) we had recently) and reflections from @nadia and @matthias have made me give some thought to what our role is in enabling our community members to get through COVID-19 in the context of our NGI work. \n\nI have been turning over the concept of contact tracing, which the EC seems so keen on (and the efficacy of which our expert interlocutors questioned deeply). I think that 'contact tracing', removed from its other context, actually describes our SSNA work very well. A better kind of contact tracing -- where we trace how community members are helping each other already, and what they need to do that; and a tracing that enables more contact, not less, as we connect people together who we see are working on the same or compatible issues. \n\nThe platform is already so much more alive with meaningful stories of these kinds of contact. \n\nThe ethnography team is creating a new \"COVID Codebook\" and think we should create an SSNA mapping these \"COVID codes\" to show how people are innovating and dealing with the crisis. In a way, this could pave the way for SSNA as a crisis management tool --- like in Open Care, mapping what communities are already doing and where they need help and support most. \n\nThis builds on the Open Care finding, especially relevant given what is going on with the EC's divesting of funds to an app, that NGOs and governments are constantly putting money and resources in the wrong place. We already have concrete evidence of that from the surveillance pandemic and we have only just started this phase of community listening in the time of COVID. I am sure that @alberto, @noemi, and @johncoate remember these lessons well from Open Care.    \n\nI want to share some stories from Open Care to show what I mean -- how community members are already expressing what they need in times of crisis; how those needs aren't being served by the big organisations that are trying to help them, because those organisations don't have the infrastructure in place to listen to what they need; and how community members use technology in creative ways that bring people together, when that technology is tailored to their needs and not designed elsewhere and handed to them as a pre-packaged solution that doesn't take into account their context. \n\n\n@alex_levene turns our attention to mental health issues in crisis scenarios (not unlike our healthcare workers today, volunteers in refugee camps face giant welfare tasks under enormous resource strain): \n\n[quote=\"alex_levene, post:1, topic:503\"]\nMental health for the volunteers is a concern. Everyone lives on a knife-edge. Most volunteers self-finance their time working in Calais. They live frugally, stretching their money out. This means they end up living on top of each other. The warehouse team has a caravan park attached to the building. Volunteers with no money can stay there. Living up to 6 people in a caravan, with limited access to hot water and personal space. Volunteers who live in this enclave have a different experience to those who stay in private accommodation or hostels.\n[/quote]\n\nHe stresses the need for mental health resources, but shows us that resources often don't get where they need to go: \n\n[quote=\"alex_levene, post:1, topic:503\"]\nEveryone experiences some form of trauma. Most experience exhaustion. Often trauma comes from being in scary situations that you aren\u2019t trained to deal with. Occasionally volunteer social workers, therapists and psychologists stop by the volunteer camps. They offer their services for free. As always, the people who need it the most are most likely to not take advantage of these services.\n[/quote]\n\nWe learned this fact from @aravella_salonikidou as well, who put together backpacks for refugees when she noticed that aid organizations and governments frequently make decisions without consulting refugees or people with expertise in refugee issues, so often resources go to waste and people do not get the kind of materials they need:\n\n[quote=\"aravella_salonikidou, post:1, topic:517\"]\nLocal authorities and their services operated superficially while the government was obviously unprepared. On the other hand, citizens reacted vigorously and passionately despite the fact that they didn\u2019t mobilize immediately.\n[/quote]\n\nHer expertise and  research lead her to come up with solutions that would actually meet people's needs on the ground: \n[quote=\"aravella_salonikidou, post:1, topic:517\"]\nDue to my profession as a fashion designer and manufacturer, when I heard about all those calls for clothing needs I started wondering who will manage all these diverse supplies. When facing a disaster, food and medical aid are considered top priorities but it\u2019s not widely known that wearing inappropriate clothing under extreme conditions can become life threatening.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that if we focus on specific issues we can come to interesting conclusions e.g. Public misinformation by \u201cofficial\u201d announcements that were based on internet searching or common knowledge about clothing. As a result, there was a shortage of A-shirts (tank tops) while, considered useless, thousands of used socks were gathered although it costs less to buy new ones. Also, acrylic socks were suggested as the most appropriate. But when there\u2019s no luxury of changing them anytime, other materials are more suitable like; wool, bamboo, cotton, tactel etc.\n\nObviously, a problem, arisen from common everyday items, is more complicated than initially thought and requires an expert\u2019s opinion.\n\nSo, without surprise, no one reached out to experts from the clothing sector for professional advice and assistance. Moreover both government and UNHCR ignored any proposals or contact efforts.\n[/quote]\n\nMeanwhile, she notes, resources were going horribly to waste: \n\n[quote=\"aravella_salonikidou, post:1, topic:517\"]\nThe inadequate coordination among government authorities, NGOs, solidarity groups and other stakeholders in combination with the anxiety of refugees led to a disappointing result. Large amounts of food, clothing, medicines and a lot of useless things (that could be a separate funny story), were being carried around Greece like a giant pinball machine. Unnecessary shipments, aid wasted, corrupted by mold, insects or still remain in inappropriate warehouses. A serious waste of resources.\n[/quote]\n\nSeveral community members also lamented attempts to use technology as a cure-all for refugee problems. As Alex asks:\n\n[quote=\"alex_levene, post:1, topic:6249\"]\nHow do we stop building apps and start building communities?\n[/quote]\n\nAttempts to provide care that are not localised and do not consult people themselves, in short, do not serve peoples\u2019 needs best. Tomma found this when observing how refugees are creatively using limited resources to transform their living spaces:\n\n[quote=\"tomma, post:1, topic:670\"]\nwe were shown the little gimmicks to improve the bare rooms where they are living in at the moment: How they pulled out screws and nails from the walls to make clothing hooks; how you make a wall-mounted phone holder with just duct tape and a piece of wood; where to store the food; they showed us how they hack the beds to create more privacy and how to shield the light falling onto the upper beds with merely pieces of wood and a blanket to a point where one could create an entire ceiling with just white cloth.\n\nWe learnt quickly that the ideas of how to use the space could never occur to someone who has never been in that exact position:\n\n**It was evident that they know best about the needs and necessities in their very situation and environment.**\n\nWith the creative potential, the only problem lies in the lack of tools and materials.\n[/quote]\n\nThese are just a few examples of many, from Open Care, that indicate that SSNA's value is in **enabling contact through contact tracing**  -- seeing what community members are already doing to help each other, what resources they are articulating that they need, and connecting people together who are doing similar or compatible kinds of work.", "created_at": "2020-04-20 12:23:51.906225", "updated_at": "2020-04-20 16:39:05.893760", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1355, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 633.8, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [536, 550, 6282, 703], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 2915, 8, 5059, 3, 5209, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31888, "user_id": 212, "topic_id": 3250, "post_number": 26, "raw": "<b>great</b>\n\nthanks!\n\nM\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-30 08:50:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:55.323368", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78630, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13827, "post_number": 6, "raw": "We can make a post there and see if people get into it.", "created_at": "2020-06-10 09:45:58.781894", "updated_at": "2020-06-10 09:45:58.781894", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [78608], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59656, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 10755, "post_number": 21, "raw": "And then there are the perhaps easier to identify situations where there is _not_ a fallback.

This time, we will be somewhere in Scandinavia, and the software we are working on is Dreams. You can see it [running for the Borderland](http://dreams.theborderland.se/) ([a co-created event in Denmark](http://theborderland.se/)) or check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Metaburn/dreams). \n\nDreams is a platform used to co-create events. Any participant of an event can create something they want to do, set a budget, and all participants can then decide what to fund with tokens. Over the years, we've gathered a lot of ideas on how we could improve Dreams and make it even more usable. Some of these improvements could be:\n\n* To make it possible to have the Dreams platform run on a single site and allow any organization to simply create new events without having to first set it up on their own servers.\n\n* An admin interface for Dream guides, the people who are helping project creators live up to event guidelines.\n\n* Different categories with different pots of grants (for example, have 30% of the grants be earmarked for art that stays on site of the event)\n\n* Ability to donate more money to the Dreams fund by buying more Dream coins.\n\n* Integrate placement in Dreams.\n\nWe still don't know what the priority would be of these improvements.\n\nI want to plan a coding retreat somewhere in the Scandinavian countryside, for one week, probably end of March (week 13) \u2013 though that can change depending on availability of people and places. I have some funding available from the Participio project,  but I would like to ask for a contribution from the Borderland for renting a suitable location for a week.\n\nDuring this week, we would also prepare the Dreams platform for the Borderland 2019. Doing this in the past has unfortunately been solitary work during long nights in front of a screen, and I'd like to add some magic and community feeling to that experience.\n\nYou can participate in this project in three ways. The first two ways of engagement are currently mostly for those who are participating in the [Borderland event in 2019](http://theborderland.se/), but the third is open to anyone with the right skills and interest.\n1. Participate in pre-development planning of which features are to be implemented.\n2.  Participate in an open hackathon during the first weekend, where we explore the possibilities, experiment and do some coding.\n3. Participate in hands on coding, UX/UI design and other development during the focused development week, which will end with us deploying a new and improved version of Dreams.\n\nFor those participating only in the weekend hackathon, they will be asked to cover their own travel expenses, but food and accommodation will be covered. \n\nThose who want to work on the developing the platform for the following week will apply.

I'm Edgeryders' community journalist and have taken the liberty to edit the transcript. If you feel like this explains who you are, you can replace it as the first post here:\n\nI&rsquo;m a social entrepreneur and technology researcher, currently enrolled as an MSc candidate at the Oxford Internet Institute. I&rsquo;m interested in the global governance of emerging technologies, and how we could possibly shift the narrative shift from &ldquo;cyberwar to cyber peace&rdquo; as a practical utopia and a guiding north star, including internet-related technologies such as the governance of AI.\n\nMy journey of becoming politically aware started when I was quite young, I was about 12. I became passionate about figuring out how we can get to a world with hundred percent renewable energy as fast as possible. And that was my utopia, it really inspired me and got me going. It&rsquo;s a topic that is actually now all over the world and in the headlines, but back then, it wasn&rsquo;t so much.\n\nComing from a small town in southern Germany, I travelled to different places for protests. And this what connected me to research and political institutions. But at some point, I wondered what impact have those discussions with politicians and lobbyists and activists really? In the end, how do both the ecological imperative and the changes we need to make globally bound by our ecological reality?\n\nUnfortunately, the economic argument has won until now. And within this political arena, I became very frustrated with it. But it also made me think: if the economic argument wins, maybe I should learn better how it works. That is how I got into business ethics, asking the question: how can we reimagine how the economy and how businesses work, to challenge the money making paradigm, moving towards about thriving humans and the common good \u2014 and which contributions companies should aim for.\n\nCompanies can slow down due to technological developments. So, I realized that if we can get the technological change right, it could also be a good opportunity to change how our economy and society work for the better. Because it&rsquo;s technology which are the moving pieces shaping new things, and our generation has the opportunity to co-shape these technological changes. That&rsquo;s the opportunity I want to take, to use technology together with our human insights, intuitions and values, to create a more humane society and economy.\n\n## A Tech Philosophy\n\nI find egalitarian philosophy very appealing, particular, John Rawls&rsquo; idea that freedoms should be equal and that everybody should have some basic civil liberties. When we look at material conditions and apply how unequal division of resources is only legitimate if it actually benefits those that are least well off \u2014 a different principle formulated by Rawls \u2014 we can see that our current system isn&rsquo;t justified. It isn&rsquo;t upholding that standard, in the sense that the technology is often not centered on the most vulnerable people in our communities and societies.\n\nWith regards to Silicon Valley culture: start-ups often purports to save the world, but are bought by venture capitalists, which then again are owned by those who already own the world. It&rsquo;s self-feeding.\n\nI find it sad that all this beautiful technology, which could be built into incredibly meaningful solutions, have to &ldquo;make a profit.&rdquo; For example, social media companies \u2014 they innovated, but were immediately pressured to become profitable. The copyright debate falls exactly within this sphere, although I could imagine we arrived here through different paths.\n\nThe philosophy I&rsquo;ve developed around these issues, means we really have to be willing to think radically different about how to make changes, in a massive way.\n\nI don&rsquo;t like to merely complain about how things should be very different. I didn&rsquo;t like to only talk about business ethics, so I also dived into social entrepreneurship and founded companies myself. I tried to not just talk about how business should be run differently, but do it. And that&rsquo;s quite difficult.\n\nThe methodologies of business could be useful when applied to different ends. For example, Muhammad Yunus idea revolves around the idea that you found a social business, and use business means for social ends to solve real social problems \u2014 not for the kind of problems they&rsquo;ve been conventionally associated with.\n\nOne more additional thought that helped me to develop my own philosophy, is what I call pragmatic idealism: hope without critical thinking, is just naivety, but critical thinking without hope is just cynicism; confidence without humility, is just arrogance, but humility without confidence, is sheepishness; and pragmatism without idealism is just opportunism, but idealism without pragmatism is just wishful thinking.\n\nI found that pragmatism and idealism need to work together: we need to have really have ambitious goals, but also be really pragmatic about where we start.\n\n## Reshaping the internet\n\nI have several different utopian visions on how to reshape the internet. During my undergrad degree in Amsterdam in Social Science, I wondered how international relations in global politics fits into the cyberspace which we are increasingly living in. How do we combine global politics theories with these new technologies. That&rsquo;s when I came up with the idea of moving from cyber war to cyber peace.\n\nI noticed that my computer for some reason didn&rsquo;t recognize cyberpeace as one word, but did recognize cyberwars. I looked it up in different word processing programs, and none of them knew cyberpeace, but all knew cyberwar. That was an interesting revelation: the vocabulary that we have in the conceptual space of the internet, is conceptualizing it as war, we don&rsquo;t even know how to talk about it in terms of peace, because we don&rsquo;t have a word for it. That obvious asymmetry means that cyber is somehow linked to a very aggressive and violent place. Which made me realize there&rsquo;s some utopia missing.\n\nTo define cyber peace, we should first examine peace in the real world. The idea of world peace has always existed, but somehow we&rsquo;ve not achieved it yet. Immanual Kant argued in his 1795 called Perpetual Peace, that the states with a republican constitutions \u2014 in other words democracies \u2014 should all guarantee each other security. When they would do so, we would have an ever expanding union of peace, because nobody would ever attempt to attack such a block of countries. And we could have an ever expanding unit of peace.\n\nDecentralization is another important part. Kant argued that we don&rsquo;t need a centralized contract or an institution, or a treaty: it would emerge out of the enlightened actions of individuals and countries.\n\nBut perhaps 18th century philosophy doesn&rsquo;t completely explain the internet, as it is a very different beast. If you look at the long term trends, we have not achieved real peace. But overall, we live in a more peaceful world than ever before. And I think we should continue to have progress in this sphere. When we speak about the internet, we often discuss cybercrime and a cyber war between countries. But what we really should aim for is to have a utopian vision\n\n## From Cyderwar to Cyberpeace\n\nI believe cyberspace actually could be a much more peaceful place than the world we live in physically. That&rsquo;s because of the different dynamics of security in cyberspace. It&rsquo;s very asymmetric. And it&rsquo;s very different from the 20th century Cold War thinking, which often has been the only dominant security paradigm applied to the internet. The superpowers which are emerging, are basically trying to copy these old patterns into this new world.\n\nBut I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to work out and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s desirable, it doesn&rsquo;t work that way. That&rsquo;s because because of the internet&rsquo;s asymmetry. A commonly heard argument is that on the internet you don&rsquo;t know who your attacker is. If you don&rsquo;t know who your attacker is, you can&rsquo;t retaliate, even if you have offensive capabilities. If you have a nuclear bomb, the other person is not going to bomb you because you can retaliate. This Cold War logic doesn&rsquo;t work with the internet. And anyone can destroy somebody else&rsquo;s offensive capability by building up their own defenses. Meaning that if you have security for yourself, and if you do security research, and you find vulnerabilities, then you can basically destroy the offensive capabilities of others \u2014 because they rely on these vulnerabilities. You don&rsquo;t know if I have a nuclear bomb, and just because you build some protection doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t have a nuclear bomb. But if I have an exploit to which there are no fixes yet, and you close that gap, then I don&rsquo;t have a bomb anymore, I don&rsquo;t have a weapon anymore. Basically, you can take away somebody else&rsquo;s offensive capability by building good defenses. I think these dynamics have not been fully understood yet by policymakers.\n\nI also believe that security could move away from being state-centric. My vision for cyberpeace is involving everyone in a certain union \u2014 and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a contractual union \u2014 which works towards building collective defenses. In other words, a global norm for &ldquo;zero day&rdquo; reporting in which countries report on these &ldquo;zero days.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll not only improve their own security, but also the security of everyone else. To many, this might sound too idealistic. But I don&rsquo;t think it is. I think there are very pragmatic reasons to do so. If you&rsquo;re part of this defensive union, then you will be much safer than if you&rsquo;re not.\n\nGenerally, I would apply Kant&rsquo;s vision that, in the end, we want to live on a peaceful planet or in a peaceful cyberspace. Hopefully, the whole internet will be a safe space, but we can start by creating smaller safe spaces. There will always be cyber attacks. But we can minimize the impact and increase the integrity of everybody&rsquo;s experience on the internet\n\nA global norm for &ldquo;zero day&rdquo; reporting encourages everyone to contribute to everyone&rsquo;s security: you can&rsquo;t close the vulnerability for yourself only, you&rsquo;ll do it for everyone. At the same time, the only &ldquo;them&rdquo; are those who don&rsquo;t want to work together to make everyone&rsquo;s experience safer, which is basically the people that want to keep the exploits to themselves.\n\nI do not have a very clear institutional setup of how this would work, because obviously, it&rsquo;s very difficult to control it. But my point is more on shifting the narrative from a place where a lot of war is happening \u2014 cyber war \u2014 to a place where cyber peace is possible, and where we should make sense of peace.\n\nIt&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s responsibility to make this shift happen, but I think institutions such as the European Union are well equipped for it. The US&rsquo;s current administration, \u2014 which obviously controls the most powerful capability \u2014 is not going to be willing right now. But, I hope that this could change given history&rsquo;s trajectory. We didn&rsquo;t think it would be possible to start a counter proliferation movement in the nuclear age, but we now actually live in a world with less bombs than 50 years ago. I know with the internet it&rsquo;s a long shot as well, and it isn&rsquo;t going to happen overnight. All the talks at the UN level are basically non-existent on this topic. But I really do hope that we could live in a world where we have less, not more, attacks and more integrity of everybody&rsquo;s devices.\n\n## On AI and Ethics\n\nWhen I started focusing on the narrative shift in cyber peace, I realized that besides being state centric, there were also several practical problems with it. And so I wanted something more positive than that. And that&rsquo;s when I got more interested in AI, as I believe it offers an opportunity to positively shape human thriving in many ways. To unlock this potential, we need to avoid its many risks, which are often discussed and which are very real.\n\nSomehow, every utopia involving machines which can do more than we do, always ends up being a dystopia. This means we still have to do a lot of work on which utopia we actually want out there.\n\nAs I&rsquo;m a pragmatic idealist, my ideals are also based on my pragmatism. This means I don&rsquo;t believe in a world where we get rid of AI. Let&rsquo;s take as an example the unabomber, who bombed scientists, because he believed that the progress of science and technology would destroy human society. And given that I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a viable path \u2014 living with less technology \u2014 then the question arises: how can we shape the current trends and the current technologies that are benefiting humans instead? And how can we consciously decide not to use them?\n\nBut, overall, I&rsquo;m convinced that we will be able to create machines which will be better at performing certain tasks than humans are. Given that&rsquo;s going to come, the question is: how do we want to do that? The biggest problem is related to human centrism. So, how can we ensure that the tech aligns with our values?\n\nWhen we look at AI governance questions \u2014 such as the one pioneered by Nick Bostrom: what do we do when general AI outsmarts humans? \u2014 they are extremely valuable questions to research. But we shouldn&rsquo;t forget the short term questions. For example, if we have a system making legal decisions in a public administration, what laws do we want to be imbued into that? Do we want some sort of human mandate, or democratically elected institutions, or do we want this to be done by an AI? In addition, do the outputs \u2014 in the material sense \u2014 have to be fair if it&rsquo;s cheaper and faster? Do we just accept that? Or, do we want to also be able to actually understand the process to be accessible for humans? This is crucial, as many advanced machine learning programs are currently black boxes to us, we can&rsquo;t really understand them.\n\nThe other question revolves around the idea that if it&rsquo;s trained on human data, human centric data, then it&rsquo;s going to take human vices with it. Even more so, it could aggregate and exaggerate them.\n\nThere&rsquo;s a lot of open questions, and I don&rsquo;t really have all the answers of course. My utopia is quite abstract right now, because there&rsquo;s a lot of research and thinking and testing and acting to be done in this field. What we should focus on right now is to reap its benefits and avoid the risks: to ensure that we humanize the technology that we live with, in the sense that we really challenge what it means to be human ourselves. And right now, we don&rsquo;t. If we first figure out what it means to be human, then we can also tell how we want technology to help us to thrive.", "created_at": "2019-11-05 14:10:09.514736", "updated_at": "2019-11-05 14:10:09.514736", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2650, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 41.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [62431], "is_liked_by": [8, 4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18505, "user_id": 2010, "topic_id": 2749, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>The main challenge for a coworking space is financial aspect</b>\n\nHi, Noemi.\n\n<span>Actually I have a ft job (which I also combine with a university program).

On the other hand, this has also the consequence that we move very slowly forward. Our current status is that we have about 5 members, and we are hosting a number of events starting from next month.</span>\n\n<span>About the <em>too social</em> aspect of a coworking space, I think this is something we have to think about...

I think diversity can be an advanteage for your coworking space, but it also may be a challange if you want everyone to feel part of a community..</span>\n\n<span>Anyhow, I think maybe the common model of a coworking space -- a large hall with 10s of coworkers -- is maybe not the best environment for freelancers to feel 'home'. More and more I come the opinion that the best coworking space is one wich consists of smallers spaces (rooms with 4-5 coworkers), with other words: community which consitst of smaller communities<span>.

Chaos informacyjny jaki wytwarza si\u0119 przez nagromadzenie wiadomo\u015bci z r\u00f3\u017cnych stron sceny politycznej powoduje, \u017ce trac\u0119 zaufanie do swojego ogl\u0105du sytuacji i czuj\u0119 si\u0119 niepewnie. To co wydawa\u0142o si\u0119 jeszcze kilka lat temu stanem jaki znam niemal od dziecka, dzi\u015b ulega silnym zmianom.

Czego zatem brakuje? Czego potrzebujemy? My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce potrzeba nam rozm\u00f3w, debaty, dyskusji, otwartego &quot;bezpiecznego&quot; konfliktu. Najgorsze w tym wszystkim jest to, \u017ce niezale\u017cnie od tego czy zmiany obecne s\u0105 dobre, czy nie, to s\u0105 to zmiany, kt\u00f3re nie zosta\u0142y wsp\u00f3lnie wypracowane w pocie czo\u0142a spo\u0142ecznej dyskusji, ale w\u0142a\u015bnie narzucone przez silniejszego. Cierpi na tym tzw. zaufanie spo\u0142eczne, kt\u00f3rego poziom od lat i tak plasuje Polsk\u0119 w tyle europejskiej stawki. Ma to wp\u0142yw nie tylko na wielkie wska\u017aniki, ale na nasz\u0105 codzienno\u015bci. Na zaufanie do w\u0142adz, do s\u0105siada, policjanta, s\u0142u\u017cby zdrowia, nauczyciela etc.\n\nNiezale\u017cnie jednak od wielkiej polityki, ludzie coraz cz\u0119\u015bciej bior\u0105 sprawy w swoje r\u0119ce i to chyba jest jedyne remedium na taki stan rzeczy. Miodem na moje serce jest przygl\u0105danie si\u0119 zmianom (zmiana!) spo\u0142ecznym zachodz\u0105cym w Warszawie.

But before we enter the magical world of OS philosophy i had to be mind blown once again.\n\n<a href=\"https://re-publica.de/en/16/session/what-you-need-see-immersive-storytelling\">Immersive storytelling</a>\u00a0\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) is a new technology that for most of us still looks as gadget, but for the company RYOT it is a change maker in immersive journalism. With the motto: \u201cA riot is the language of the unheard\u201d by Martin Luther King they want to give the 360\u00b0 camera to people in places that normally aren\u2019t heard. VR can make you feel immersed into a story much more easily than any other medium. Instead of explaining how children have to walk to school in Beirut, why not show them through the eyes of the concerned. Everybody can be a storyteller when you can film your surroundings like that, it seems that<a href=\"http://ryot.huffingtonpost.com/\"> RYOT</a> found the right spot to bring VR to a whole new scene.\n\n<a href=\"https://re-publica.de/en/16/session/innovation-refugee-camps\">Innovation in refugees camps</a>\n\nWhen the first giant refugee camps where set up, the people who worked there assumed that they where a short-term solution. But now, 25 years later a lot of those camps are still their and sometimes more then 300 000 people are living in that temporary space. What happens to those people living in a daily struggle, having an urge to settle, but also always having a chance to be evacuated?\u00a0\n\nThrough this lively panel made up by four on the field specialist we learn that we have to stop as society to victimize refugees. We need to search for empowerment tools, and we could find it in innovation. The people there are resourceful, but just need the right chances to work it out. Invest in refugees, not the camp. They will find the material stuff easy, give them energy (electricity and water), the tools for education and it will possible have a far better outcome then any specialist that will construct the camp.\n\nBut of course it isn\u2019t that simple. A lot of barriers are in place to keep refugee camps from becoming own entities: Politics, Legislation or even big stakeholders on an economical level don\u2019t see the camps as an opportunity to learn how to deal with conflict and solution based thinking in times of crisis.\n\nOne of the solutions a person of the panel was giving was the need of a resource mapping tool. Just showing the people where they can find resources around could give them far more independence. We need to start connecting with them on an equal base, don\u2019t look at them as \u2018lesser humans\u2019. By changing our attitude on how we look at them we could help them much more.\n\n<a href=\"https://re-publica.de/en/16/session/open-source-society-and-sustainable-development\">Open Source Society</a>\n\nManuela Yamada was one of the persons i met at POC21 and already then I was impressed how strong-minded she was towards open source and sustainable materials. She is the founder of Materiabrasil an open source platform showing all the specificities of sustainable materials.\n\nThrough her lecture she explains how Open Source models can bring much change in the way we interact with each other. Classical consumerism is dangerous on the long term because it follows the logic: what we can make, we consume.\n\nShe pleads that through empowering civil society in an open source environment we can bring the change we want in our environment. She showed different examples on how already now Open source ideas are better and cheaper as the alternative. Like Open Energy Monitor or her own created low-tech Coconut fiber that uses a material that is in abundance in Brasil and gives it a new use.\n\nOf course when the public could react that one question that always pops up discussing open source was asked: but how do you make money? And Manuela had a charming and complex answer: dedications, diversification, thrust and still a lot of hope. Cause making money in a open source business model isn\u2019t perfect at the moment. It is in an experimental phase, but if you have in return a warm contact with your clients, a sustainable product and an ethically way of dealing with partners and your team, it is worth the try!\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"https://re-publica.de/en/16/session/neo-tribes-future-tribal\">Neo-Tribes: The Futur is Tribal</a>\u00a0\n\nAlexa Cley was also part of the POC21 community for a week to observe the \u2018tribeness\u2019 of POC21. She comes from a family of misfits: thanks to a father studying ancient tribes and a mother observing Alien believing people she got the right amount of \u2018outside the box\u2019 thinking already from her childhood. That immersions in other cultures give her the spark to start neo-tribes: an observation and knowledge-sharing platform about post-modern tribes.\n\nWhat can we learn from Gangs, pirates or hacker collectives? After spending time with each of those groups Alexa found out that, even if their business isn\u2019t the most ethically correct, the way they organize themselves is resourceful and sometimes much more efficient and meaningful than how we organize ourselves as a society. They have codes, respect for each other and are a much stronger group. They have cooperative reflexes that we thrive, but can\u2019t manage to organize.\n\nAnother reason she started Neo Tribes is because she felt the urge to answer a necessity from a lot of young people to jump out of society. There is a crisis of meaning, burn outs all out and time poverty lurking at every corner of our society.\n\nSome of the colourful tribes she met with:\n\nGangs: they have the skill to make feel people part of a community\n\n<a href=\"http://labarbelabarbe.org/\">La Barbe:</a> A woman action group going to mostly manly events and through fun actions try to represent minorities.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.prepperwebsite.com/\">Preppers</a>: people that are preparing for the end of the world\n\nCults: there are still some witches around\n\n<a href=\"http://www.enspiral.com/\">Enspiral:</a> a tech-savy group of researchers in New-Zealand making tools for enhancing civic society.\n\nSurprisingly she mentioned a group I wouldn\u2019t have seen as a tribe, but from where she learned a lot: LARPing is a form of live action role-play that could be used to prototype the future. What can we learn from an immersive play for a weekend around a post nuclear society, or where roles are inverted or money became obsolete. LARP gives us the possibility to invest new ways of living without the constraints of being trapped in it.\n\nFinally she evokes the question a lot of people have had after an awesome festival experience: why can\u2019t we bring the festival culture to our every day live? For her the biggest problem of festival is that it still is a tool of escapism, how long can people be conscience about the way they live in a festival. Without a structure or model, the festival atmosphere will fall like a castle made out of cards. Even examples as Boom Festival or Burning Man can exist because they aren\u2019t an everyday occurrence.\u00a0So Neo-tribes is still going a long way, but it is great to see and hear that we can learn from every kind of misfits, even the Amish!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-18 14:02:03", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 05:28:50.928990", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1370, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64368, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 11569, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Have not tried it.

Ro\u0111ena sam u Vukovaru, gde sam zavr\u0161ila osnovnu i srednju \u0161kolu. Nakon toga dolazim u Novi Sad na studije i ovde \u017eivim poslednjih desetak godina.\nOd malena sam naklonjena humanisti\u010dkim naukama. Interesuje me li\u010dni razvoj kao i pomaganje drugim ljudima da \u017eive kvalitetnije \u017eivote i ispune svoj potencijal. To tako\u0111e zna\u010di i prou\u010davanje funkcionisanja ljudskog mozga, emocija, mi\u0161ljenja i pona\u0161anja, me\u0111uljudskih odnosa\u2026  kao i te\u017enja za ispunjenjem potreba du\u0161e i duhovnog dela sopstva.\nZavr\u0161ila sam visoku \u0161kolu za vaspita\u010de, sa specijalizacijom za likovnu umetnost. Nakon toga zavr\u0161avam osnovne studije psihologije i student sam prve godine master studija poslovne psihologije. Tako\u0111e sam edukant tre\u0107e godine Ge\u0161talt \u0161kole za psihoterapiju. Smatram da ova edukacija doprinosi mom  profesionalnom i li\u010dnom razvoju.  \nTrenutno sam u potrazi za praksom kao psiholog u sektoru ljudskih resursa i planiram da u tom pravcu razvijam svoju karijeru. Mislim da poslovna psihologija i psihoterapija mogu lepo da se uklope u svetu biznisa, kroz bolje razumevanje ljudskih potreba, pobolj\u0161anje uslova rada, zadovoljstva poslom, motivaciju zaposlenih, razne edukacije i treninge, \u0161to sve zajedno uti\u010de na produktivnost na random mestu. Tako\u0111e se otvora mogu\u0107nost doprinosa kroz psiholo\u0161ki konsalting i intervenciju u organizacijama.\n\u017delja mi je da jednog dana, pored posla u organizaciji, pru\u017eam i privatno svoje psihoterapijske usluge.\nU slobodno vreme volim da \u010ditam, da se dru\u017eim i upoznajem nove ljude, boravim u prirodi, eksperimenti\u0161em sa vege receptima, slu\u0161am muziku i ska\u010dem po stanu :) , crtam ili stvaram ne\u0161to kreativno. \n\nSmatram da, ako \u017eelimo da u\u010dinimo svoj \u017eivot boljim i menjamo svoju okolinu, trebamo krenuti od uzroka, umesto da se baviti samo posledicama. Ni jedna promena nije laka i ne dolazi brzo, stoga trebamo uzeti odgovornost u svoje ruke i u\u010diniti onoliko koliko je u na\u0161oj mo\u0107i da doprinesemo okolini u kojoj \u017eivimo, a posle i \u0161ire. Kroz edukovanje mladih mo\u017eemo dru\u0161tvu pru\u017eiti \u0161ansu da se postepeno menja i formira bolje i kvalitetnije okru\u017eenje. \nOno \u0161to mislim da karakteri\u0161e na\u0161e prostore jeste generalno nezadovoljstvo \u017eivotom usled nedostatka prilika za zaposlenjem, lo\u0161eg obrazovnog sistema, kriminala i korupcije, zaposlenja preko veze-\u0161to podrazumeva zapo\u0161ljavanja nestru\u010dnih kadrova i omalova\u017eavanja kvalitetnih stru\u010dnjaka, nedostatka prilika za razvoj mladih, manjka promovisanja pravih vrednosti kroz kulturu i obrazovanje i jo\u0161 mnogo toga. \nOsvrnula bih se detaljnije na jednu od navedenih stavki, a to je \u2013 nedostatak prilika za razvoj i uspeh mladih ljudi. Susre\u0107emo se sa apsurdnim zahtevima gde se od kandidata za posao o\u010dekuje bogato radno iskustvo i stru\u010dnost, a pri tome nedostaje prilika gde bi se takvo radno iskustvo steklo. Ne postoji poveznica izme\u0111u teorije i prakse, kao ni prilike za u\u010denje prakti\u010dnih znanja.\nStudenti provode minimum tri do pet godina svog \u017eivota u\u010de\u0107i teoriju koju nemaju gde da iskuse. Sa fakulteta  se izlazi sa gomilom informacija, gde se \u010desto nau\u010deno razlikuje od primenjenog. Ako osoba ima priliku da se zaposli, susre\u0107e se sa tim da neke stvari primenjuje potpuno druga\u010dije od onog \u0161to je do tada u\u010dila. Ono \u0161to tako\u0111e opa\u017eam, \u0161to sam iskusila i na svojoj ko\u017ei, jeste da postoje pote\u0161ko\u0107e ne samo pri pronalasku posla, nego i pri tra\u017eenju prakse ili volonterskog rada. Mladi konkuri\u0161u na dosta mesta i ne dobijaju nikakav odgovor ili im kompanija odgovori da trenutno nemaju prilike za praksu. Ve\u0107ina kompanija ne \u017eeli da tro\u0161i svoje vreme na obu\u010davanje mladih ako od toga nemaju odre\u0111ene koristi, tj ako u skorije vreme ne planiraju mesto za novog zaposlenog.\nUkoliko ljudi nemaju sre\u0107e da prona\u0111u posao, kasnije se susre\u0107u sa ejd\u017eizmom- bivaju diskriminisani zbog toga \u0161to do odre\u0111ene dobi nisu stekli priliku za zaposlenje. Mladi ljudi imaju ose\u0107aj da gube vreme u ovoj dr\u017eavi bez prilike da iskoriste svoj potencijal, \u0161to rezultira odlivom mozgova tj odlaskom u druge zemlje za boljom budu\u0107no\u0161\u010du. Smatram da je to katastrofalno po na\u0161e dru\u0161tvo. \n\n\u017delim nekako pridoneti tome da se ova situacija promeni. Verujem da je to mogu\u0107e i da se mo\u017eemo ugledati kako to izgleda u nekim razvijenijim dr\u017eavama, gde je sistem obrazovanja moderniji i uskla\u0111eniji sa vremenom i potrebama.\nZbog toga smatram da je povezivanje ljudi i ideja jako va\u017eno za bilo kakvu promenu u dru\u0161tvu.\nVolela bih da postoji na\u010din na koji bi fakulteti vi\u0161e sara\u0111ivali sa raznim organizacijama. Za sada na nekim fakultetima, uklju\u010duju\u0107i i moj, postoji saradnja sa pojedinim organizacijama u vidu kratke prakse u trajanju od nedelju dana. Smatram da je to premalo da bi se i\u0161ta nau\u010dilo i slu\u017ei vi\u0161e da bi se studenti bar donekle susreli sa tim kako njihova profesija izgleda u praksi, bez mnogo aktivnog uklju\u010divanja.\nOnako kako ja zami\u0161ljam pravi vid saradnje jeste da su fakulteti i organizacije mnogo \u010dvr\u0161\u0107e povezani na na\u010din koji je sistemski razra\u0111en za dobrobit svih strana. Saradnja u kojoj bi studenti bar 1-2 puta nedeljno odlazili u kompanije i bili zaista uklju\u010deni u posao, te primenjivali znanja koja u\u010de na fakultetu, gde bi program fakulteta pratio aktuelne trendove poslovanja. \nIdealna opcija bi bila promena celog sistema obrazovanja, gde bi npr jedan semester bio teorijski, a drugi prakti\u010dni, ali to ve\u0107 iziskuje promenu na nivou dr\u017eave, \u0161to je jako te\u0161ko i sporo. Nadam se da bi neki manji, ali vredni koraci doprineli tome u budu\u0107nosti.\nKroz ovaj oblik saradnje na nivou od 1-2 puta nedeljno, studenti bi pri zavr\u0161etku studija mogli odmah biti osposoboljeni za rad. Kompanije tj poslodavci bi bili motivisaniji kada bi imali vi\u0161e koristi na na\u010din da bi za po\u010detak dobijali besplatnu radnu snagu, sve\u017eije ideje i poglede na rad, dobijali bi neki vid garancije fakulteta o kvalitetu studenata na praksi, mogli bi da oblikuju studente po svojim potrebama poslovanja i da prate njihov napredak. To bi rezultiralo krajnjim odabirom najkvalitetnijih studenata za zaposlenje, kao i povezivanjem, preporukama za dalju saradnju. Tako\u0111e ne bi morali da tro\u0161e dodatno vreme i novac na obu\u010davanje novozaposlenih. \nKlijenti koji koriste usluge kompanije bi tako\u0111e mogli da dobijaju, zavisno od profesije i oblasti rada, usluge studenata po ne\u0161to jeftinijoj ceni ili kroz volonterske usluge (npr savetodavne i psihoterapijske usluge). Pitanje je na koji na\u010din motivisati organizacije i doprineti njihovom osve\u0161tavanju koliko dobrobiti od ove saradnje mo\u017ee imati celokupno dru\u0161tvo. \n\nOno \u0161to mi se \u010dini kao super ideja jeste da bi za po\u010detak bilo dobro kada bi se oformilo bar jedno udru\u017eenje/organizacija koja bi svojim delovanjem ohrabrila i pokazala dobar primer ostalima koliko dobra mo\u017ee da se uradi saradnjom i povezivanjem zarad dobrobiti svih. Moja ideja je da ta organizacija bude neko \u201cUdru\u017eenje primenjene psihologije\u201d gde bi mogli da budu uklju\u010deni stru\u010dnjaci iz svih oblasti psiholo\u0161kih nauka ( gde bi se bavili npr psihologijom rada i mena\u017edmenta ljudskih resursa, psihologijom marketinga, pedago\u0161kom psihologijom, klini\u010dkom psihologijom, mentalnim zdravljem, psihometrijom tj konstrukcijom psiholo\u0161kih testova, psihoterapijom, pa \u010dak i osna\u017eivanjem mladih da pokrenu svoj privatni biznis itd). Udru\u017eenje bi imalo svrhu direktne saradnje sa fakultetima psihologije, gde bi studenti obavljali redovnu praksu uz mentorisanje stru\u010dnjaka. Na taj na\u010din bi pripremili studente za rad pri samom zavr\u0161etku fakulteta. Ovo udru\u017eenje bi vremenom imalo i mogu\u0107nost pro\u0161irenja kroz zaposlenje studenata, kao i povezivanje studenata sa organizacijama koje bi na najbolji na\u010din dolazili do proverenog stru\u010dnog kadra.\n\nSvi smo deo jedne velike celine i na\u0161e akcije itekako uti\u010du na sve oko nas. Mada, \u010dini mi se da u dana\u0161nje vreme ljude sve \u010de\u0161\u0107e treba podse\u0107ati da su dru\u0161tvena bi\u0107a i da \u0107e \u010dak i kao jedinke za sebe mnogo br\u017ee napredovati ako su povezani me\u0111usobno na pravi na\u010din.  Svesna sam da je to veliki izazov za nas, sve dok su ljudi u poziciji pre\u017eivljavanja i borbe za opstanak, zato \u017eelim da vremenom svi postanemo deo ove promene.

It seems to be forming a playground where new and radical ideas can be tested and implemented. The original developer of Scuttlebutt, Dominic Tarr, describes his MO as: \u201cnot to build the next big thing, but rather to build the thing that inspires the next big thing, that way you don\u2019t have to maintain it\u201d and this seems to have set the tone for Scuttlebutt itself.\n\nOne of the core elements of Scuttlebutt is that users can host data for other people on the network without being directly connected to them. This has the positive effect that users in countries where internet usage is highly restricted can connect via other users - though on the other hand, this also means that users could unwittingly be hosting information they would rather not propagate. There have been instances of the Norwegian alt-right using Scuttlebutt to communicate. Scuttlebutt has been working to address this issue but solutions are imperfect so far.\n\nThe bottom line is that distributed systems such as Scuttlebutt are both democratising and empowering and they come with a whole new set of possibilities and challenges.\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Hugi here:**  [Data Terra Nemo: First report & Scuttlebutt](https://edgeryders.eu/t/data-terra-nemo-first-report-scuttlebutt/9928/4)\n\n*Join our Workshop on Inequalities in the age of AI, what they are, how they work and what we can do about them.

Dosta ljudi iz sela koji su se slili u grad, ali nisu postali malo urbaniji, nego su uticali sna\u017eno da grad, koji se uveliko napu\u0161ta, postane malo zadrtiji, malo tvrdji, malo ograni\u010deniji. Govore \"\u0106uti, mo\u017ee i gore\". Navikli su na te\u017ee od toga da sagnu glavu. Ovo nije univerzitetski grad. Kada zavr\u0161e srednju \u0161kolu, mladi odlaze na fakultete, oni sa nekakvim ambicijama. Oni koji ostanu upadaju u rutinu, za\u010darane krugove, \u010desto ma\u0161taju da nisu tu. Zanimljivo je \u0161to mladi ipak odlaze na fakultete s obzirom na \u0161iroko rasprostranjenu svest da obrazovanje ne zna\u010di ni\u0161ta i nema nikakvu vrednost. \nPrvo sam, ka\u017eem, bila besna. Pa mi ih je bilo \u017eao. Jasno mi je da kada ne zna\u0161 za mogu\u0107nosti ne mo\u017ee\u0161 ni da bira\u0161. \u010cija je krivica? Ose\u0107am da treba da budem zahvalna svojim roditeljima. Izgleda da neki ljudi nikada ne vide raskrsnicu, pa samo idu tom stazom napred, makar ih vodila u ambis. \nIpak, postoji ta stvar sa vremenom.... Ovde vreme druga\u010dije te\u010de. Laganije. Smirenije. Kada sam pre nekoliko dana izgubila sat i po' vremena u beogradskom gradskom prevozu osetila sam se kao da sam pretrpela nenadoknadiv gubitak. Kao da mi neko duguje to vreme. Oteto. Besmisleno potro\u0161eno. Nepravda. Nagrnula su se\u0107anja na sva ta \u010dekanja, stajali\u0161ta, autobuse, rentirane stanove, hladne, vla\u017ene, na stanodavce ovakve i onakve, selidbe, torbe kroz gsp... \nKvalitet \u017eivota.

Thank you for taking the time to so deeply consider pathways for Edgeryders research and our ongoing collaboration with you! \n\nIn terms of: [quote=\"francesco_maria_zava, post:3, topic:7602\"]\nhow much it might be possible to define a kind of future program on the directions and modalities of \"doing research\" that could characterize Edgeryders' path.\n[/quote]\nthis is a pertinent and timely question. Indeed, as with all of our work, it is just as much a question of the **_how_** as the **_what_** - and I appreciate you foregrounding the importance of mapping out the landscapes with possible methodologies and postures that Edgeryders research might engage. Soon I'll start a separate thread opening the question up to the community and will be sure to tag you as your insights will be appreciated.\n\nAs for: [quote=\"francesco_maria_zava, post:3, topic:7602\"]\na plan that identifies trends and tries to contemplate the different ways through which to build synergies and develop strategies both with the institutional infrastructure \"consolidated\" and with the innumerable initiatives and experimentations born and raised in the field of open source culture and knowledge sharing.\n[/quote]\nagain you are spot on to foreground this here and I appreciate your approach. This is certainly something that will be core to the research unit's work and one of the ripe opportunities we have. I've begun thinking about it across the scales of _**onsite**_ // _**online**_ // _**meta-strategic**_ as I find this consolidates the various infrastructures and processes that encompass Edgeryders' overarching projects with our networks P2P initiatives. I think the key will be balancing : \nmaking sure that we keep listening to the collective intelligence of the network through emergent processes such that we sustain a ground-up responsiveness to research and action-based-research opportunities, \nwith \nhaving a strategic, overarching vision that harnesses the shared processes and interconnected insights for long-term mutual benefit and social change. More on thinking collectively through how we do that soon! \n\nReally look forward to collaborating more with you on this.

Lawsuits regarding free licenses are very rare; there is a <a href=\"http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Law\">list of controversies regarding Creative Commons license</a>s on their website, but it is very small. I don't know if it is comprehensive, but I think it covers most of the cases gone to the court.\n\nMoving to free software, there is a <a href=\"http://gpl-violations.org/index.html\">whole site dedicated to GPL violations</a>. However, although <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License\">GPL</a> has a much longer story (starting from '80) than Creative Commons, and a wide diffusion, there are few infringement cases. I think that the first case gone to the court was in the early 2000s. Some people have seen this as a weakness; some others as an evidence that nobody dares to challenge the GPL.\n\nIf your point is \"what can I do if I realize someone is violating the license of a work of mine?\", well, as for any infringement, you have two options:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>persuade the infringer to abide by the license;</li>\n\n<li>sue him.</li>\n\n</ol>Of course, you probably don't want to choose the second way. If the first one doesn't work... well, it depends on how much energy do you want to spend in it.\n\nThe Creative Commons organization makes clear that they don't provide legal assistance. However, there are some groups that give free advice about free licenses (like <a href=\"http://selili.polito.it/\">SeLiLi</a> in Italy), albeit not legal assistance in court.\n\nAs for the situations where free licenses have enabled people to do things (almost) impossible otherwise, an example are large collaborative projects. What I have in mind is Wikipedia: it is based on the work of a huge number (hundreds of thousands?) of people, who work also on the same page and in an unplanned way, therefore it is essential that each one of them has the possibility to edit what the other ones wrote. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Licensing_update\">Since 2009</a>, Wikipedia uses Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike, but also before a similar license (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License\">Free Documentation License</a>) was used. Without such a license, it would not be possible to build anything like Wikipedia.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-05 09:07:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:06.013058", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 433, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8346], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86309, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14712, "post_number": 14, "raw": "@amelia and team, I have done some more work on this.

In this case, I first created a graph where each co-occurrence gives rise to its own edge. This is the only way to make sure each edge belongs to one, and only one, language forum: each edge is induced by a post on which the two codes co-occur, and each post belongs to one and only one forum. \n\nSecond, I created forum subgraphs, and color-coded the edges accordingly. \n\nThird, I created stacked graphs from each forum subgraph. \n\nThis means that each stacked subgraph is a faithful reconstruction of what goes on in that subforum. On the other hand, the subgraph ignore each other: the one for Polish only knows the value of `k` *in the Polish subforum*. The only way to get a rough idea of how much the different fora \"agree\" is by looking at where they position themselves in the graph (I applied the layout on the root graph). \n\nI also provide an updated [documentation](https://github.com/edgeryders/network-viz-for-ssna/blob/master/README.md) in the repo. \n\nI plan to attend tomorrow's meeting, I guess you will have questions. :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2020-11-05 16:48:05.084668", "updated_at": "2020-11-05 16:48:05.084668", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 248, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 41.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4779, 6484], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65217, "user_id": 5211, "topic_id": 11743, "post_number": 2, "raw": "![9650|645x645](upload://1MmnzgwWsfLtXmWVntSJcpASMbq.jpeg)\n... zrejme nejakej vasnivej ctenar/hrac... jakym zpusobem se budes seznamovat priste, pres Renatu asi uz ne, co?!:)) Dej vedet, pridal bych se... ;)", "created_at": "2019-11-22 18:19:54.657576", "updated_at": "2019-11-22 18:19:54.657576", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65275, "user_id": 5823, "topic_id": 11759, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Ask the person who is speaking right now what their name is, and if they already have an edgeryders.eu account?

I know I promised to give an update about my activities since moving to Nagorno Karabagh/Artsakh last autumn to some of you, including @alberto,  @alex_levene and @unknown_author so here we go. \n\nFirst of all, I regret I failed to participate at Openvillage Festival in Brussels and the camp in Morocco (I can't believe I am not there) while relocating and reorganizing my life due to circumstances. I also fu*ked up and lost some side projects that provided me with a minimal income keeping me afloat because bad internet, oh well. \n\nIt's been hectic and disturbing at times, but I guess I made it, after 5 months, I can finally say I feel home in this war-torn region where people are still traumatized and need healing. I got a community too! \n\nI felt lonely and questioned my decision many times, but then I decided to view my time here as a voluntary exile, a sort of residency, with time to reflect and work on my future projects related to human borders, war traumas, collective memory, conscription and how it affects lives...away from the bubble of Yerevan and putting myself and my capacities to test, feeling what I always felt, but sharper and stronger.\n\nSo, here are the things I've been doing since moving out of my comfort zone:\n\n* I managed to coordinate and curate [a group exhibition in Yerevan about the lives of Syrian refugees in Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/12/refugees-improve-armenia-social-fabric-171214061224398.html) in Yerevan\n\n* I finalized my project draft \"Juggling Dinosaurs\" that tackles the issues of parenting and the role of mothers in Post Soviet reality.  The project aims to interrogate female art practitioners experience of being mothers, and to question social expectations and norms which frame this role. After completing my research I plan to host a residency for parents in Armenia, providing the freedom for them to work independently or alongside their children, encouraging opportunities to work in collaboration with other artists by creating a supportive and inspiring network.\n\n* As I've witnessed a lot of violence in this society(a vicious circle of army, patriarchy and war) which exists in families and outside, even in institutions like my daughter's kindergarten, I'm working with the local government/Ministry of Education, trying to find ways to train the teachers and teach about non-violent methods of education. I made a deal with [an alternative school in Yerevan](http://www.mskh.am/) that agreed to host and train teachers from Martuni free of charge, now waiting for the Ministry of Education to approve the project(meeting with the Minister this Friday). The training will be followed up so it's not going to be a one time event. Alternatively I am drafting a project to host seminars here for parents and teachers on healing the war traumas in collaboration with the [Women's Resource Center](http://www.womenofarmenia.org/)\n\n* Organising a contemporary art festival in Stepanakert, Nagorno Karabakh with the aim to decentralize art and culture from Yerevan and help Stepanakert evolve into a thriving international cultural center. Ultimately\u2013the project will help rebuild essential infrastructures and establish processes that will advance economic viability within the region\u2013all the while contributing to world culture. The venue for the festival is the Stepanakert Drama Theatre established in 1932, located on a beautiful central historical street in Stepanakert. It is currently left vacant and awaiting demolition, though it continues to be the favourite spot for the local youth to meet up. From outside the \u201cbeauty of Stepanakert\u201d as it used to be referred to, still looks great and it has preserved its initial charm with carved doorways and magnificent arches. I already got the OK from the Ministry of Culture of Nagorno Karabakh to use the space and I am working on raising funds from private donors and diasporan agences(most of intl organisations do not operate here because this is an unrecognized/ disputed territory which limits the funding opportunities) but I definitely hope to make this work. The festival is scheduled on 17-20 May, 2018 so I still got some time. Please, let me know if you know of any organisations that I could apply for funding and also, if you are interested to contribute or participate, I can send you the project concept and details by email. Here are some photos of the theatre building that will host the festival. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/199229919f2c24c203a909fdb1cf4310d1ff7039.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e1ade3d92ff68dff8eb5530c2d8a38cae1fd992d.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/033e35277f18be6c87c131066341fa460404adbb.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/52190eca8d787fdf7682ab805a3070bf3e9cc2eb.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\">\n\nSo yeah, I've been quite busy, living off my savings, but now I need to find a source of income asap, so let me know if there is anything I can help you with, good people @nadia @noemi PS: got good internet too! :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2018-02-19 08:51:13.030515", "updated_at": "2018-03-09 19:43:21.678132", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 858, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 352.6, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3811, 5, 3791, 347, 3, 4022, 3799], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7127, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6426, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>\"We have no capital, no investors, no shares.\"</b>\n\nFor me, seeing you guys at work it's been highly rewarding: fairly technical projects requiring hard skills are\u00a0crossing over to ask fuller questions re: sustainability whose answers can only become a common resource for those of us struggling with the same.\n\n@breathinggames the four obstacles lined up above are something to include in your session description I believe - for the discussion after.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-07 09:37:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:41.994234", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 79, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31235, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2766, "post_number": 23, "raw": "<b>Re-instated community calls</b>\n\nHi guys,\n\nI've been reading this from afar, and first I want to say that community calls are back.

The Reef: where we are now\n\n![PNG|690x379](upload://sHbkU9EasEMamccJ1vgeBwGbt3s.jpeg)\n\n\n## 2. Who is the community?\n\n![Photos%20banner|690x85](upload://fu2C9XSbVNuBO6b3PFbwOm2hJa9.jpeg) \n\n* cca 35 members aged 20 - 56+, most of whom are aged 25-45\n* Belgian, German, French, Lithuanian, Spanish, Romanian, Italian, British, Luxembourg, Uzbek, Bolivian!\n* urbanists, sociologists, climate advocates, teacher, lawyer, architects, researcher, organisational developers, IT account manager, designer, agroecologist, receptionist, mother, entrepreneurs, community facilitators\n* aspire to a sustainable community, to living together \u2018more than being just flatmates\u2019, or to \u2018a new type of family\u2019\n\n\n## 3. Designing the key components of The Reef \n\nInstructions: If we imagine living there in 6 months, what do we prioritize? What principles and processes do we want to uphold? How do we formalize the commitment?\n\n\n### 3.1. Living Together \u2013 What is the Dream?\n\n* **Start with a small group**: 6-9 people\n\n* **Shared principles, not \u2018rules\u2019** that can be reviewed and adjusted over time\n\n* **Values:** Acceptance, tolerance to difference, diversity: socio-economic, cultural, linguistic: \u2018To put the diversity of the City of Brussels in a house\u2019. Younger and older people, people living different lifestyles -students, working professionals, people living life in different stages of their lives. \n\n* **Talking circle** once a week\n\n* **Facilitator?** This role is strongly endorsed by some, and not so much by others. A more professional, paid role: gather people together, someone who spots talents and pushes them to organise something; mediates conflict. \n\n**Compartmentalization:**\n\n* **Individual spaces** have different sizes depending on needs\n\n* **Creative space:** handcraft area; dancing room; other living arts which strengthen communal life\n\n* **Coworking space / Cafe / Tool library** connected to the street, like a front shop. Acts as bridge between the inside and the outside world and can be the space for organising more public events. Maybe those in the neighborhood could rent space when they need it.\n\n* **A place for agroecology:** a collective garden or terrace, because that is the place for a healthy lifestyle. Either the house is close to a forest, or if it's in the city center The Reef would have a garden inside.\n\n* **A large, 4.50 m high garage** is a very handy, multi-purpose space to include in a communal living setup. Good for storage space, guest parking or as a provisional space for other facilities.\n\n* **A big kitchen** needs to be at the very centre of the place. It's good to have a smaller kitchen if you want to eat on your own 'without feeling pressure' [like in communal meals].  The community meals should be vegan friendly - proposal, not rule.\n\n* **There needs to be access to the private spaces that doesn't involve going through the common room(s)** (when you don't want to see people or socialize). 'Buffer zones' - It doesn\u2019t even have to be a space, it could be a vacant corner or something. Ideally the building would be structured on different floors to separate private and common areas.\n\n\n### 3.2. Living Green - habits of consumption, sharing and energy saving\n\n* **Clothes repair.** As a response to fast fashion and consumerism: If there is 1 person that knows how to sew they can offer to everyone else this service of mending and preparing clothes. This is the type of service that if ends up working well, it can be offered as a service for the neighborhood. It\u2019s not high impact, but it will have an effect on buying less clothes.\n\n* **Learning through skill sharing**. Takes a long time to learn on your own. Ex: programming, or gardening.** A board where you can write a skill that you want and what you can offer - it\u2019s pretty organic. Something semi-formal would work best, to have a certain regularity. It could be every Sunday at a certain time, and actually you need to implement it at some point. Whoever is interested throughout the week they can get in touch.\nNB: 1) the people offering their skills should not be oversolicited, or instead they can pay lower rent. Also a solution could be timebanking.\n\n* **Sharing with the wider community - 'house projects'** Most people don't want to take it on as a project and be 'in charge' of a public activity, rather they want to be part of something - they could allocate 1-2 days a month in an activity if more people take leadership. The only way The Reef could be self-sufficient and things be organised organically is if someone is passionate about something and organises activities that they already do and love. Otherwise it creates overhead.\n\n* **Modular kitchen.** Shared space for the inside of the house, but once per week you can open it, or even make it a pop up kitchen in the city (example: [Cultureghem](https://www.cultureghem.be/en) in Abbatoir, Brussels). You can introduce the rest of the community to the impact you can produce inside - by using recuperated food, being part of a food coop for local produce, means of preservation and storage, and other good examples.\n\n* **Membership in food cooperatives.** If one person in the house has this practice, maybe it can become a house practice through a common subscription.\n\n* **Energy saving: how much can you go off the grid? Try to produce as much as you can but have a safety net.** We don\u2019t need to heat all the places all the time. In Belgium you need to be connected to the grid, but people live in the hangar and they have a little place there where they need only a chimney.  Or you can have a smaller place that\u2019s better insulated. Either way, everyone in the house needs to preserve the confort levels they wish, to be able to feel good in their home.\nThis is also part of learning (see above): have tools and classes that teach people to consume less.\nProposed mitigation: Agree on a midterm goal ex. 'in two years we will have done a system for creating rainwater.' If it only depends on individual choice/ behavior it will be difficult.\n\n* **Ecological toilets**: Toilets are the most underrepresented or uninteresting/ inefficient technology - you flush with your drinking water, but after the system mixes them and it has to be filtered again for you to drink it. Composting toilet is a very simple technology and safe, hygienic if you do it right, there\u2019s books about it. in Brussels, the normal house is - the house, garden, and the toilets near the stairs. It\u2019s not so hard to make it natural - it\u2019s cold, far from shower, kitchen, living places. \n\n* **Bathrooms**: It makes sense to invest some more money / equipment in having more and different kinds of bathrooms (private and shared; toilets / bathrooms to brush your teeth) \u2013 some people might prefer to pay less and share more; other bathrooms need to be more public, when others visit or attend events in the house. Also: there is a very relevant, influential book from the 1970's about the architecture of the bathroom, which was and is a neglected topic: [Alexander Kira: The Bathroom](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000703182) (there [and here](https://www.scribd.com/doc/268909137) available in fulltext online).\n\n**More:**\n\n* [Notable points from the Green Building Tech Workshop (23 Nov 2019)](https://edgeryders.eu/t/notable-points-from-the-green-building-tech-workshop/11826/) \n\n* [Documentation on Living Green from Workshop 2 (14 Nov 2019)](https://edgeryders.eu/t/towards-radical-green-communal-living-in-brussels-reflections-from-the-reef-2nd-workshop/11667)\n\n\n### 3.3. Governance\n\nWhat structures are optimal for a healthy way of organising?\n\nA mixed model between ownership and rental would be ideal. Fractal ownership is a way like this seems to be Woon Koop\u2019s mixed rent-buy model (see below). Equity crowdfunding (crowdfunding into equity) you have a share of the space But sometimes this model appears as not fair. Because the ones with more money are in a way those with more power.\n\n**Models**\n\nMatthew from [conscious coliving](https://www.consciouscoliving.com/) made a brilliant analytical study on coliving.... you can get a copy of his publication on[coliving insights](https://www.colivinginsights.com/) \n\n* Gravity: someone leases existing building, then rents them out\n\n* Co-House: someone buys existing buildings, then rents out for co-living. By now the model is stuck on rents\n\n* Someone develops existing buildings, then rents them out for co-living\n\n* In all these models the inhabitants are renting. There is a trade-off between convenience and community: co-living is an inclusive model, everything is taken care of, so when convenience goes up community goes down. On the other hand, co-housing is about buying: it\u2019s an ownership model. When convenience goes up, community also goes up. On the other hand, the need to stay liquid tends to produce conservative patterns of communal living.\n\n* Brussels model [https://www.ikoab.com/](https://www.ikoab.com/fr/)\n\n* Cooperative model (Woon Koop): the cooperative owns the building, people rent it but they also own the cooperative. In Woon Koop cooperators can put money in the Coop, and that lowers their rent. This leaves the problem of exit. Luc: \u201cit is very difficult, because we ask people that they change their concept of \u2018living\u2019, away from just talking about money.\u201d\n\n* Swedish housing associations: separate the right to live in the place from the ownership \u2192 OBOS livinglab\n\n* \u201c we invest in skills rather than embed the skills into artefacts\u201d Alberto\n\n* Matthew When community get stronger convenience get stronger\n\n* Create a rental model with more commitment \u2192 like 24 months of information before living\n\n* Whatever the model there is still some type of management needed\n\n**Wooncoop:**\n\n* Some shareowners are also living in our houses\n\n* Others are just investors. We offer a 2% ROI. Minimum investment is 3 shares: 750 EUR.\n\n* Exists since 2017. We are now running 10 projects, hoping to go to 20 by end 2020.\n\n* You can use it to coordinate purchase, development, management of buildings.\n\n* People do not own their place. They rent, but they rent from themselves. They do buy the right to live for life, and are expected to \u201cparticipate like an owner\u201d in running the building.\n\n* The spaces do not have to be standard \u201cbut you can\u2019t have golden floors, still someone else needs to be able to live there potentially\u201d.\n\n* We have the ambition to allow people to move from space to space staying within Woon Coop. To do this, we estimate we need at least 1,000 units. For this reason, we do not create a coop per project, but keep everything in the one coop.\n\n* In the future, it will be compulsory to move from one apartment to the other.

They have to put in at least \u2153 of the cost of the project. The rest is split between a banking loan and other investors. The group then gets a reduction of 4% of the amount they put in.\n\n* Shares can be sold. The procedure is strictly regulated.

And because the infrastructure upgrades were paid for from the interest, rather than the capital, we've still got a large buffer to work with.\n\nThe main reason it was set up like that, is because we were very conscious that this was a one-time bonus. If we squandered it, we wouldn't get that chance again.\n\nWe also had to put a large amount of emphasis on resilience planning, as the climate we live in is harsh. Winter-time is not always fun, it's when you get weather for dying in. With the forecasts for the rise in sea-levels, and with the regular 10-year and 20-year storms, we've had to put strict limits on where you can build, as the flooding is regular.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n@Alberto.

As I had promised to do the tag rendering and it slipped off my list somehow ... . Ok, so here it goes.\n\nYou (and all other content managers and admins) will now see little colored triangles \"\u25b6\" at the start and \"\u25c0\" at the end of a tag, both when viewing content and when editing it (in the \"Filtered HTML + Tagging\" mode only). For example I tagged <span>myself here</span>, or compare <a href=\"/t/working-out-loud-latest-on-tbilisi-conference-organisation/3054\">Noemi's post here</a>, which already has tagging applied. The color of the triangles will indicate tag type (topic, action, place etc.) and when hovering over it, you see again the tooltip with the tag name. When you add several tags to the exact same piece of text now, several of these triangles will appear the start and end. So by hovering over each of them, you can see the names of all the tags you applied.\n\nIf the colors-and-tooltip combination is not sufficient for visual indication of how you tagged things up, I can adapt that to your wishes easily now, including: (1) colors per tag instead of per tag type, (2) other symbols instead of just triangles, per tag type or tag, (3) image icons instead of the triangle symbols, (4) text color, background etc. of the tagged text itself, though I guess that will make it hard to read and can also lead to weird combinations when tagging text with multiple tags.\n\n<a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>, you gotta come over here and look at what your ethno-tagging editor prototype has become <img alt=\"laugh\" height=\"23\" src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png\" title=\"laugh\" width=\"23\"> I kinda surprised myself with this solution ... it's still a <em>bit</em> of a hack but it was simple and ... umh ... simple is beautiful in this case.

I am not going to focus one what was said but on the process of participation. For me this begins with the invitation:  \u201cWe would love to invite you as a speaker. If you think it would make sense we are happy to also invite for example one of the coauthors you mentioned in the post on the topic (https://edgeryders.eu/t/19-11-brussels-workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them/10326/40).\u201d This is a clever invitation. It flatters the invitee a bit, I am invited as a speaker and it is clear that some homework was done. I am being invited because of some content I co-wrote, so it also attempts to bring in significant others as well as pointing me to the fact that I am invited not because of work that I wrote alone but that I co-wrote, in participation. Very hard to resist. So I say yes and I plan my trip to The Netherlands around it. Would I have done this if I was not invited as a speaker? I don\u2019t think so. \n\nSo when afterwards it turns out that there are no speakers at all, \u2018just\u2019 participants, I have to realize and reflect on this fact that I probably would have missed out on this evening if I had not been invited to speak. Being used to being invited as a speaker I think back to all these meetings I have not joined not being invited as one and so I am left with having to reflect on my own behavior and patterns. \n\nAs it turned out, everybody was to be a speaker. Two groups were formed. In the middle of each five chairs are placed. A larger circle is around them. The organizers have invited four people in each group to sort of kick off the discussion. T he fifth chair is for a participant.  Interestingly as a personal reflection I was not even invited to \u2019speak\u2019 as on of the first four, which I found again quite well done and a good lesson in ego management. I actually wonder now if not everyone was invited as a speaker? Two rounds of an hour. The format sparks people bringing ideas and content, not so much hard personal opinions. I decide to listen. Recently I bring pen and paper to Conferences and meetings like this, so I listen better. Otherwise mails keep popping up or I start to Twitter. I hear a lot of good things. After the break into the second round @alberto to taps me on the knee and tells he he is going to call me in. I whisper \u2018No\u2019 at first as I am happy \u2018just\u2019 listening, but Ok I think I am here and I have story so why not. I go the chair in the middle and after a while I slip out again.  Discussion. Nice. Then I make a quick remark from my outer seat chair. Two people grumble a bit. After all the rule is: if you want to talk you have to go the middle chair. I am thinking I am not going to that chair just to say this one line. So I do it again. This time there is an angry reaction and muffled shout: Go to the middle! I am not doing that, but I realize another very significant part of the process. A part that I always knew existed and even plan for, but now the obviousness is palpable as is the tension. \n\nI realize that for me the rule of speak in middle chair is quite arbitrary and actually has been conjured up with all of us in plain view. Yet even if that \u2018rule\u2019, that \u2018format\u2019 is arbitrary and in existence as temporary as the \u2018group\u2019 exists, some people - some intelligence with particular characteristics - is taking this so serious that is has become the next normal and must be adhered to. That is a very logical and normal position. I am not right in my view to immediately subvert an attempt to arbitrary format making. I am entitled to it. I do it. But the right of another not to do that is just as logical sound and morally just. So I am living, being very embodied in this \u2018process\u2019 as there is real tension (for a while) a very important participatory design process lesson: \u2018design\u2019 the format and design unraveling the format while taking into account the opposition against that and make this realization part of the process for all.\n\nThis evening was able to bring it very significant and important questions for my own practice that is very relevant to the co-creation, participation and community management that I do daily. As such the process does reflect on the contents of what was discussed; how can we bring about a greater sense of co design of citizens in the new technologies that seem to emerge quite distinct from other human needs and longings?", "created_at": "2019-11-22 08:43:21.823225", "updated_at": "2019-11-22 11:16:16.436396", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 864, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 115.6, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4, 4022, 5, 2567, 5604], "is_private": false}, {"id": 976, "user_id": 522, "topic_id": 943, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/811791a27ac1ed6648e4dd092c9acfb147ff0153.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\">\n\nThis month was one of the most active and important months on Edgeryders!

This work is important exactly because of what you bring up here -- these communities can sometimes assume because they are not white Americans, they do not perpetuate anti-Black racism. There are good primers on how South Asian, East Asian, and Arab communities historically and currently perpetuate anti-Blackness, for example (this is part of the education work I am trying to be involved in in my own Palestinian community). So one of the things we can do is try to get Europeans to share their experiences and think more critically about how anti-Blackness does occur in their community, either in explicit or implicit ways. \n\nImplicit bias is a narrow framework for conceptualising racism (because there are larger forms of structural injustice above and beyond implicit bias that constrain the success of black people, legacies of historical forms that were more visible and codified than they are now), but it's an important starting point, particularly for those who think they are immune to racial discrimination. This [report](http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-kirwan-implicit-bias.pdf) from the Kirwan Institute at the Ohio State University is a great resource --- it's readable and reviews and explains the research on implicit bias. Very worth reading if you think that because you can't see racism around you, you don't perpetuate it in a range of ways. \n\nThere are other approaches we can also discuss. In Europe especially, people tend to disconnect histories of colonial domination from current racial inequalities.", "created_at": "2020-06-04 14:12:50.121811", "updated_at": "2020-06-04 14:12:50.121811", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 353, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 48.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [78293], "is_reply_to": [78293], "is_liked_by": [5209, 5059], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81747, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 10017, "post_number": 63, "raw": "And it looks like Google has a variation of this kind of bot decision behavior making ridiculous errors:\n\nhttps://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200810/11335745081/why-are-there-currently-no-ads-techdirt-apparently-google-thinks-were-dangerous.shtml", "created_at": "2020-08-13 17:51:54.832385", "updated_at": "2020-08-13 17:51:54.832385", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 38, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [81745], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41854, "user_id": 3791, "topic_id": 7993, "post_number": 12, "raw": "I did a quick research and No, There is no makerspace or publicly accessible workshop.

And people registered to the event via [Eventbrite](http://tiny.cc/cooperate).**\n\nThe event was live-streamed and also [recorded](https://youtu.be/8ZU1qfqe9XQ).\nWe also had the pleasure to have short video-interviews with the speakers: one interview was with [Michel Bauwens](https://youtu.be/YWFQPuHBzw8) and another one with [Liliana Carrillo, Dick Van Gelder, and Anna Melenchuk](https://youtu.be/YEIKrItTipQ) \nAnd I am personally happy to have a [promotional video](https://youtu.be/9gTV-2lDNyU) for coming events.\n__________\n\nAfter the event, I have wanted to keep the conversation on going, and I have sent an eventbrite message to the participants and speakers to invite them to share their thoughts and feelings about the event.  \nVia this post, I want to become the example.  By sharing my thoughts and feelings about the 'Cooperation at Scale' event in Brussels, I hope that others (participants and speakers) get inspired and find the courage and time to also share their thoughts and feelings and in this way **augment our Collective Intelligence!** :slight_smile:\n___\nHere we go, questions and answers:\n\n\n**Tell us about yourself. What are you working on, and why were you at the event \u2018Cooperation at Scale\u2019?**\nI organized this event and attended it because I am passionate about Collective Intelligence, and cooperation is one of the branches of it.  \nAt the moment I work as a freelancer, a digital/social entrepreneur and a researcher focus on Collective Intelligence matters: coordination (adhoc communities, coordinating collective actions), cooperation (networks of trust, open source software, peer-to-peer business) and Cognition (market judgment, predictions of future events in politics/technology).  \n\n**What was the key question you came to the event with?**\nMy key question was/is: Are we aware of how competition is embedded in our systems (educational, social, financial,...)? What do we need to change to create a more collaborative world? Can we change our mindset from competition to collaboration? \n\n**What did you expect to learn from this event?**\nI wanted to hear about the commons, peer-to-peer cooperation, and technologies than can support this to scale, as Holochain.  Also, I felt curious to hear about intellectual property that supports collaboration, and where people feel safe to share knowledge and ideas. \nAnd, I was very motivated to learn from the participants and their projects, connect with others around the topic of Cooperation at Scale, and the next generation internet that supports this to happen.\n\n**Did you learn what you expected? Have you heard something new? Something that you liked? disliked?**\nI learned about a lot of new things but nothing really in deep.  I need to do more self-study and attend more events, and also organize more events.\n***Interesting things I learned from some participants:***\nI heard about new projects and initiatives. For example, @friedger organizes meetups on the topic of [Digital Human Rights](https://www.meetup.com/Digital-Human-Rights-Belgium) and via his page, he also shares about other interesting events related to data ownership, digital rights, human rights, digital twins.  \nFrom Kris, I heard about the [CommonsStack](https://commonsstack.org/) initiative, and I would like to hear more about it.\nAnd, I wish to have heard more from other participants, and to connect in general more. For a next time, I will add some active moments to connect, for example at the beginning of the event we could have introduced ourselves, or during the event there could have been a moment for a fishbowl activity to exchange knowledge and learn from the participants.\nBut for now, I hope that I can hear more about the participants via email or via this platform as I wish to connect more with everyone who attended the event.\n\n***Interesting things I learned from the speakers:***\n*From myself -* I enjoyed sharing why I organized the event, and my main interest on collective intelligence, and also on democracy, and how technologies can allow us to cooperate in real time globally, something that is impossible to do in real life on one physical location, a question of scalability, viability.\n*From Michel Bauwens -* His talk inspired me a lot as I heard of cities like Ghent with transition platforms '[Gent en Garde](https://gentengarde.stad.gent/)' around common management of food strategies and local policies. \nHis talk also triggered me to study new technologies, and compare them, and also to be more critical about them.  I was intrigued to hear that blockchain technologies are based on competitive games, not on cooperative ones, and that they tend to create ecosystems based on extraction.  I definitely want to learn more about it and do my own research on this.\n*From Anna Melenchuck -*  I liked to hear about governance initiatives that are connecting citizens and governments in an easier way.  For example the [EU lobby bot](http://eu-lobby-bot.cheeezer.com/?fbclid=IwAR0jipi7R9UKMMNTwSBCW6Yn-mAIh7Mxp3JpIfmP0cF8p2rR8szGXJqkY2A#connect-with-mp) and [E-Women platform](http://e-women.instingov.org/) developed at the [Institute of Innovative Governance](https://instingov.org/) and [European Digital Development Alliance](http://europeandigital.org/).\n*From the Panel on Intellectual Property -* I was surprised and also confused to hear that we all have the right to copy.  It was curious to hear the different approaches to copying, for example copy-right, copy-left, copy-fare, creative commons and other kids of licences.\nI heard that patents are very expensive and that they are somehow also 'stopping/blocking' innovation for about 20 years from the time of issuing.  \nI learned that basically if we don't go for patents we have to compete and be very fast in the market to show that we are the first to innovate.  I liked hearing about copy-fare and how we could feel safe to share our knowledge and even get financially compensated when someone uses the knowledge in a commercial way.  For me, it was interesting to hear that [CreaFree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9-bYkGzd2s) is working on this.\nThere are some aspects I did not like from the panel.  I have to say that I found it a bit messy, and there is room for improvement.  For a next time, I will support the panelists to have more regular calls before the panel, and get better connected with the moderator.  At this event, the moderator had a preference for free sharing of knowledge and was fully against copyright, and I found his attitude towards some of the panelist a bit disrespectful, as some of the panelist were lawyers with knowledge about patents and copyright.\nI am not sure if others experienced the panel like that, or if this was my own impression.  It would be interesting to hear the experience of others related to the panel.\n*From Raphi See -* I liked to hear a bit about [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) and its ecosystem of projects and ventures, even though time was not enough to hear in deep about Holochain.  I heard that this technology can support us to get organized in different and varied ways and I am curious to learn more about it.  Raphi mentioned about some of the projects/ventures in the Holochain ecosystem: [Holo](https://holo.host/), [Junto](https://junto.foundation/), [humm](https://humm.earth/), [sacred capital](https://www.sacred.capital/), [AllianceBlock](https://allianceblock.io/), [orion](https://orionprotocol.io/).  And, we got invited to join the [Holochain forum](https://forum.holochain.org/) and get over there to learn more about the project, as well as follow the [tutorials](https://developer.holochain.org/docs/) prepared by the team. \n\n**What was the key takeaway from the day?**\nCooperation is possible and there are many initiatives contributing to this, but... there is still a lot of work to do to create a global cooperative/collaborative system.  Initiatives are too fragmented, and there is a need to build bridges among them, connect different actors.\n\n**What would you like to learn more in deep at the next event?**\nWow! I love learning!  and I would like to learn a lot more about all the initiatives working towards cooperation/collaboration at scale: social, digital, economics, infrastructure, policy,...\nStep by step, I will personally contribute to this by organizing events to show several of the initiatives that I know, and I hope to contribute to build bridges, and connections among the initiatives.\nProbably, the next event that I will organize will be focus on Holochain and its ecosystem.  And then the next one will be about 'Peer-to-Peer and the Commons'.  \nI wonder what others would like to hear next to start planning the events...  :slight_smile: \n\n**What do I see as the single largest challenge for cooperation at scale?**\nFragmentation of initiatives.  We need to build bridges.\n\n**What single thing would you want to see that supports you to cooperate/collaborate more with others?**\nSystemic change at economic level as the current system is based on competition.\n\n**What would be your message to others who did not attend this event?**\nIf you have landed to this page, probably you are already interested on cooperation/collaboration at scale, and probably you know about initiatives that are contributing to this.

Drawing investment to Medenine from companies that work on rebuilding Libya and  on planned Chinese and Tunisian developments (I am not sure I understand what this is - maybe you can explain this in more detail?)\n\nWhat is needed to make it happen:\n\n* Community building and coordination (offline and online)\n* People with specialised skills to help with the technologies\n* Experienced project leaders/realisors of self-sustaining/successful intiatives\n* Financial resources for covering additional costs of the holders of the space. A question: how would you engage the owners of the spaces to join the network if there are no financial resources available to incentivise them? What would they need to be part of it? This is not something you need to answer now, but it is something we have to keep in mind as a big question.\n\nMeasuring progress: if we were starting from a blank slate, the approach I would take is somewhat different.\n\n* At the level of the individual participant: Rather than measure the number of initiatives people are coming up with - perhaps we can find a way to measure the number of meaningful exchanges/collaborations that result in people developing their skills. Or find some tool for individuals to map out their individual learning path, and have some peer mentorship/assessment of how they are doing.\n\n* At the level of the participating space in the network: Perhaps we could also look at the rate of initiatives that go on to become self sustaining, the number of people engaged in projects, and how long/how much on average does each participant invest in projects or activities. A question there would be how to make this visible in a way that does not feel like policing or judging people.\n\n* For overall impact of all three: closer to [what Alberto outlines here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/on-assessing-impact-and-what-edgeryders-could-do-in-that-department/10708).\n\nThoughts??", "created_at": "2019-10-06 12:49:26.342865", "updated_at": "2019-10-06 20:13:11.811757", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 370, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [60753], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60179, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10869, "post_number": 2, "raw": "hej @Michal, jestes kolejna osoba, ktora zglasza sie z tym pytaniem do nas - @apophaticos te\u017c o tym pisa\u0142a, czekam na rozwini\u0119cie jej spostrze\u017ce\u0144\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/roznorodnosc-spoleczna/10685/3\n\nWiele os\u00f3b wydaje si\u0119 zgadza\u0107 z tez\u0105, \u017ce je\u015bli spotkamy kogo\u015b spoza naszej kultury, to nasze zdanie na jego/jej temat ma szans\u0119 szybko si\u0119 zmieni\u0107 - wyrastamy ze stereotyp\u00f3w.

This, as we have discovered works best when we ping individuals one by one. And to get them to sign up in ways that allow us to get in touch with them outside the sinkhole that is Facebook. Then follow up and help onboard them onto the platform one by one. \n\nThis means: sign up on forms set up by @owen such as the ones on tell.edgeryders.eu. Why? Because we need to guide them through the process including changing their email settings so that our notifications do not end up in spam. \n\nThe approach I will be taking for my AI & Justice Event  is a three step process:\n\n1. Find people using keyword searches on social media, \n2. Each person on the search result one by one to point them to the activity, \n3. If they respond positively, e.g retweeting I get back in touch to see if they want to sign up to a mailing list through a form.\n\nI recommend that the activity organisers (and people responsible for the local event signups) do the same for their activities and languages. This will enable us to more easily reach out to people next year, rather than start from scratch.\n\nThis is the list I have compiled (there are some activities that will be added this week - such as five hackathons that will be taking place in Cairo, Medenine, Tunis, Somewhere in Morocco and maybe Jordan and Lebanon): \n\n* <strong>November 11, Brussels + Livestreaming:</strong>  Working with science fiction authors like Cory Doctorow and economists like @alberto to propose radically new models and shaking up the established order.

I too was about to panic in the dark when I stumbled upon the unMonastary.\n\nThe idea that we all seem to think that if the other guys just understood, then they would adopt our goal is interesting and definitely rings true. \u00a0I'm wondering if we talked to the people on the other side of that, if they would feel the same way.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I had a fascinating discussion along these lines. I, of course, think that addressing climate change is the one and only issue, and it trumps all the other issues without any contest. The very smart thoughtful young activist I was talking with, whose work is all about racial injustice and oppression was shocked at the way Naomi Klein had reframed climate to include all those other things, and now my friend was much more open to working on climate. I was shocked that she was shocked that they were connected (well duh, who did she think lived on those low-lying islands or was going to suffer the most from droughts); and also shocked that she thinks racial injustice trumps climate (everyone is going to die).\n\nSo in there, I think is the nub of going forward. \u00a0We need to shape our arguments so that they make sense to the values and concerns of those who seemingly oppose it. AND we have to keep this framing constantly live, so that there isn't slipping back in to old ways of thinking. It takes a lot of exposure to really change the way people think.\n\nThat is why if you can get lucky, like we did with Zipcar, it is great to not have to change people's minds or behaviors, just appeal to their most obvious and immediate self interest.

It is called openrampette and is being developed with the Comune di Milano, another opencare partner.\n\n...\n\nThe group has a discussion about best ideas on the prototype and how to involve citizens of Milan in the design phase. There\u00a0 are also needs to develop an app for openrampette.\n\nThe discussion goes deep in understanding whether the job consisted in reviewing (advanced prototyping) or development. The problem is that there are not enough indoor skills to develop for mobile. Even IoT (Internet of Things) would have been interesting, but there were no news from the groups.There is a proposal about creating a course for app developers and an internship, but it doesn't seem feasible. The UX (User eXperience) approach is a main issue, but a simple \u201cnice, try, next\u201d way cannot work. There is agreement on the fact that the ramp should stay light and not, for instance, 40 kgs heavy.\n\nIn a presentation of the project there is a interesting discussion about understanding what is not included in the procedures (the rules enforced by the Municipality), and in the advantage of accessing the database mapping the ramps in the city.\n\nSome hypothetical cases are discussed.\n\nThe idea to work on is about a \u201cramp on call\u201d that occupies the ground for a very little time, the one needed for the disabled to access the shop and buy stuff.\n\nOtherwise there is the average ramp, already available where big shops, or post offices are.\n\nThe results from the questionnaires about the absence of the ramps before many shops in Milan are considered.\n\nThere is need to talk with two type of publics; on one side the shop retailers, on the other the customers on wheelchairs. There is the proposal of a survey before and after the meetings.\n\nSome last work is put on schedule for the end of august, as prototyping, the website, documents, the wiki, the video, etc..\n\nAll the effort is designed for the local side of the city and then it might be replayed in further city contexts.\n\nA solution for \u201ccalling\u201d the ramp would be to create a button to push.\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openrampette&amp;src=tyah\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a02f65bd6a5061c4878e93cf13cd31ab0f50e5d0.jpg\" width=\"682\" height=\"500\">\n\n</a>\n\nCommunication and promotion issues in co-designing engagement of citizens (disabled and retailers mostly) are a priority.\n\nThe idea of a call is being discussed; a container in order to face by degrees what is to be included. The context is opencare so <a href=\"http://wemake.cc/mir/\">MIR</a> (Maker In Residence) could be included by creating a challenge based on this framework.\n\nThe idea is to use edgeryders as development platform and have some surveys about UX and UI (User Interface).\n\nThe viable solution seems to stay focused on the issue of accessibility in the milanese context for wheelchairs. It is something on which all the participants agree.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c5e1dff0fca5a9544aa3b1bd13b5958e0502e217.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"172\">\n\n<b>Insight</b>\n\nThe project is being discussed often in meetings (at WeMake and online with remote collaborators) and is run daily as a main activity. It is very interesting to follow the different steps about the making of the project as openrampette is not a simple issue when it comes to the technical and the social. On openrampette many questions are raised about how dealing with the processes. The shared decision making process is quite often adopted here.\n\nThe group has a lot of trust in ideas from individuals and in including the \u201cpublics\u201d in the discussion by focus group activities.\n\nDiscussions are necessary to share opinions and stay aware of the limits of proposals from individuals, but putting things together in a responsible way following a collective logic seems quite common here.\n\nThere is consideration for a need of a collective dimension about the research section of open rampette, anyway different from co-design, \u2026a group discussion among participants.\n\nFor further information:\n\n<a href=\"http://wemake.cc/tag/openrampette/\">http://wemake.cc/tag/openrampette/</a>\n\nThe procedure to participate (in italian): <a href=\"http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?e=&amp;u=38f8f84c2e510df316dd8d06b&amp;id=28e801be43\">click here</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-02 14:50:43", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 05:15:02.830421", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 999, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 51.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79218, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13911, "post_number": 2, "raw": "here we go; should work now @lroddy and @kajafarszky", "created_at": "2020-06-19 20:48:51.460220", "updated_at": "2020-06-19 20:48:51.460220", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 26.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5667], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12470, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 4136, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>thanks ....a bit not clear though</b>\n\nthanks , was looking for that review . and this explains the colours :) - asked the same question last time-\n\nbut still the other questions are still not that clear to me. like the timeline and data of the node.\n\nfor example\n\n<div class=\"popover-content\">\n\n<div class=\"node-hover-title\"><a href=\"/u/alberto\" target=\"_blank\">Alberto</a></div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>In degree:</span> 250</li>\n\n<li><span>Out degree:</span> 391</li>\n\n<li><span>Betweenness:</span> 0.3132</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nthe in and out degree = ? there is no \"?\" on them .\n\nand if there a way to find out that alberto interacted with X no of nodes through X no of edges\n\n\u00a0\n\n</div>", "created_at": "2015-02-26 11:30:59", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:41.988154", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 140, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11391], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65163, "user_id": 5787, "topic_id": 11732, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hilali  Marwan \u00e9tudiant en institut superieur de l'informatique Medenine", "created_at": "2019-11-22 14:03:42.418070", "updated_at": "2019-11-22 14:03:42.418070", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27055, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1575, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Tentative answers</b>\n\nAt last count, we were 170 in \\#LOTE, including invited politicians, government representatives etc. So 148 community is about right.

Present on the Zoom: @alberto, @amelia, @hugi, @IvanC, @johncoate, @nadia, @noemi, @MariaEuler, @martin, @matthias, @wolha\n\nThe last (and the biggest) part of the **Horizon 2020 EU Green Deal Call** is presented by @marina, with the fact sheet:\n\n* It differs from the previous calls, aims for visible results in the short to medium term with the long term perspective. The keywords are rapid scalability, dissemination, uptake.\n* The deadline is 26 January 2021, selected projects start in Autumn 2021, our goal is to enter a consortium before the end of November.\n* Eight thematic areas and two horizontal ones, which are of particular interest for us. The list of calls with the updates is [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/green-deal-call-selected-topics-for-edgeryders/14646).\n* Most of the calls mention some kind of citizen engagement. If invited, we would fit better in the calls where citizen engagement is the key and cover the social and not the technical parts of the others.\n* Preferably we should work with known and reliable partners.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\n* We are strong in locating and connecting to groups that are already working in the area of citizen science, with innovations in their social space and amplifying their work and provide explanations, therefore calls in Area 10. Creating from scratch is more challenging.\n* Gold standard for the best partnership \u2013 Open Care experience. Others lead, we have a say on the direction and can choose partners.\n\n**Strategically:**\n\n* It is too late to do something really new. The competition will be hard, the project idea must fit >100% to the call.\n* Timing for consortium building is late: the more outreach is needed to make the proposal, the less useful for Edgeryders is the proposal.\n* We cannot administer grants. The goal is to lead in not more than one project. If necessary, leading the call is to be seen as a necessary evil if it is the only solution.\n* We need to choose the partnerships where the \u201cstandard work package\u201d can be best plugged in. Our established partnerships work well because we have built quality relationships and must keep it this way.\n* In the programmes we work on engagement, it is necessary to control the distribution of resources. If that part does not work, your credibility can be compromised.\n* Multilingual projects are very complex and require perhaps more resources than we can afford. POPREBEL works on 4 languages, there is the software support for multilingual SSNA, but it is not easy.\n* The calls are more than earlier and they all need proper preparation, it is vital to define who is doing what among us.\n* Three groups of specialists are needed in this phase: for the administration tasks and communication with the consortia while we write the application, for the outreach and engagement, for research and writing.\n* A part the other calls, it would be good if we could enter the Area 1 - *Climate neutral and socially innovative cities* call and the cascade funding that goes with it. We should search for an adequate position through our \u201ccities\u201d contacts and partners because their intellectual lead would be vital for this kind of projects.\n* The proposals should be drafted by 31 December. We need two more weeks to tune it to the quality needed for the call.\n\n**The method** that works for us is transparent and participatory.\n* We produce 1-2 pages project note as a basis to put together a consortium = gather main partners within two weeks, one more week to find eventual last partners, then comes the writing and the meetings. After the first, maximum second meeting, we create a budget which becomes a contract and a proposal - the 70 pages document.\n\nIt is possible to build our own proposals and we will explore this direction. A meeting needs to be scheduled with the minimum participation of @alberto, @amelia, @marina and @martin.

This 'feature' keeps general life control beyond powers of any single local community, thus creating the ueber-class of global moguls, who may at least pretend that they control the situation.\n\nThe current crisis comes from the fact that pretending is not enough anymore. Even the best actor, playing a brain surgeon, cannot run the real operation.\n\nHowever, there is one thing that the controlling institutions surely can try - to survive. Abandoning increasing area of social space (Erasmus case - being the latest), they tighten the grip on whatever they can still controll.\n\nSo, any support for the off-the-system living models may only come from them as a sort of 'letting steam off' measures, or the support for theme villages at best.\n\nBesides, the 'good will' attribute - by definitiion - do not apply to institutions. It is solely related to a human being. To present a good will you need to have _any_ will first. :-)\n\nA bit more hope I see if it comes to the people - be them rich and powerful, or not. But that's just what I wrote in my report.\n\nAnyway - feel free to talk and write about us, keeping in mind what is our position. Any PR may help. :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-10-23 19:34:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:09.447438", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 349, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27156, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4360, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Not sure I understand...</b>\n\nIf \"derecho de piso\" means something like \"rite of passage\", or finding your place in the pecking order under the \"top dog\" - I am really, really sorry to have contributed to that impression. That is something I am decidedly not fond of. I hope that will become clearer in community calls. Also we are from different places and many actors (institutions, companies, etc.) may have the same name but different roles in the system. Now I am not the expert, but my impression is that many places in South America \"don't fit\" into the European or North American narrative in terms of how things work there.\n\nRegarding the abstract debate: yep, you're right there - but that's mostly how it starts in my experience. Once people start bringing up concrete examples it tends to result in a lot of \"oh!\"s and \"ah - okay\"s and usually gets more productive as well.\n\nHere's a concrete example: When I had a master-thesis type project for a student that I would supervise - I did not look at the their grades even once. I talked to them for half an hour and watched them nod, or frown. Then I had them talk to me, listened and mostly gave answers only. Then we'd go to the lab, I showed them around, let them take notes, and eventually did something very simple like pouring a certain amount of chemical into a glass (still there is 1001 ways to do it better or worse). Then I let them do it, and let them reflect on that and the lab work they'd be required to do. That was it. And I tended to take the ones that made more mistakes. Most of the time they made the mistakes because they were nervous, which meant they really wanted the job. (there's no abstract meaning between the lines here, it is only an example)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-07 08:22:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:30.202221", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 334, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26523], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72834, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 13015, "post_number": 1, "raw": "```\n{\n\"host\": \"https://now.edgeryders.eu/team\",\n\"info\": \"Let's have a chat about If/Why and How to use this cool new tool :).

Build Nepal started 8 years ago in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu with a vision to be a \u201ccommunity instrument through which the people can do for themselves\u201d. Working in northern suburbs of Kathmandu, one of the rapidly urbanizing area of Nepal, Build Nepal has grown into a not-for-profit organization solely devoted towards community development. As an extraordinary contributor in community development of Tarakeshwar, some of its staff and supporters treat its survival with some surprise, even as a \u201cmiracle.\u201d But Build Nepal has done more than survived: it has created jobs, services, is a trusted partner in a wide range of community interventions and an increasingly strong voice speaking on behalf of community. Wealth in communities is more than money. Since its establishment, Build Nepal has created economic ideas directed toward the good of the community rather than private profit. \n\nFirst, Build Nepal carried out feasibility studies to find out what could be done in communities for economic transformation. It explored in diverse communities throughout Nepal, in places like Dhorpatan, Dumre, and Dolakha. Second, it studied communities close to home in North Kathmandu and formed \u2018North Kathmandu Development Council\u2019 that would help the organization to gain deeper understanding about the situation, opportunities, and challenges of the place. Agricultural farms in North Kathmandu and Dhorpatan were formed in consecutive years. Third, Build Nepal\u2019s leadership understood that economic transformation through entrepreneurship alone was not enough, but they also had to help people build capacity and confidence, creating critical mass in communities. For that, Build Nepal started prioritizing education sector and youths. \u2018Responsible Student Network\u2019 was formed and students\u2019 clubs were commenced as \u2018RSN Club\u2019 in several schools of North Kathmandu. Fourth, Build Nepal\u2019s purpose from its beginning was \u201cthe goal of community building\u201d, and building community requires accountable governance. Accordingly, it used technology as a medium to aware people about services provided by the government, with the development of a mobile app entitled \u2018Open NK\u2019 which informs communities about every relevant activities being carried out at North Kathmandu by the government or by the public. Finally, Build Nepal has recently taken a much more visible role in the advocacy for the accountability and gender-responsiveness in communities, initially through public debates and now through action research entitled \u2018Accountable Governance and Gender Responsive Public Services\u2019. As one local resident of North Kathmandu explained, Build Nepal has moved from a focus on the awareness to the more mainstream community-led approach of development.\n\nBuild Nepal has faced many challenges over the years, some unique and others common to other community development organizations. One challenge is how to build community: how to engage the community, how best to encourage it and what Build Nepal\u2019s role should be in community-led development. The second is how to manage the tension between financial sustainability and a social vision, which includes organizational development and leadership within Build Nepal itself. The third is how to build multiple partnerships in the community, with government agencies and profit-oriented companies, as well as other not-for-profits, while maintaining autonomy. Its own leadership has been a crucial element in its ability to form partnerships but remain true to itself.\n\nCurrently, Build Nepal\u2019s vision of a community-driven development practice is being materialized to some extent. North Kathmandu has been seeing significant growth in formations of communities believe in community-led development practices. People are more conscious about Government\u2019s accountability as well as citizen\u2019s responsibility. Eventually, the dream of building a \u2018Smart City\u2019 in North Kathmandu which was dreamt by Build Nepal, has gained recognition and love, and it has evolved into a public dream of whole North Kathmandu.", "created_at": "2017-08-13 11:01:07.957032", "updated_at": "2018-01-10 10:12:25.816355", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 627, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 492.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67930, "user_id": 5201, "topic_id": 12262, "post_number": 3, "raw": "That's great, Alberto!

Ono \u0161to dru\u0161tveno prihvatljivo pona\u0161anje smatra lo\u0161im (kako si pomenuo \"negativni primer\"), neko vidi kao jadnostavan sistem svog pozicioniranja u dru\u0161tvu uz koketiranje sa moralom (i zakonom) jer se od oba odavno distancirao. Jednostavno, obrazovanje, kreativnost (ideje) i pamet su postali ne\u0161to \u010dega se \u010dovek treba \"stideti\". Deplasirali su ih fakulteti sumnjivog nivoa obrazovanja, povr\u0161nost i jednobraznost mi\u0161ljenja.

Znam, napu\u0161tanje zone komfora je uvek te\u0161ko, bolno i ve\u0107ina mu se opire (nije li i svaka od objava na ovoj platformi usmerena upravo napu\u0161tanju ukorenejnih zona komfora?!) vo\u0111ena parolom \"bolje i ovako kako je nego da je gore\". A ta zona se napu\u0161ta promenom posla, selidbom u drugi grad, dr\u017eavu, promenom bra\u010dnog statusa, pa i odlaskom u penziju koja je svake godine sve ve\u0107a misterija za svakoga od nas. \u017divot koji je dobio potpuno novi tempo u odnosu na pre koju deceniju, veliki obrti kapitala, masovna proizvodnja, stalno izazivanje ljudskog mozga da se stimuli\u0161e novim izazovima jednostavno ostavlja po strani sve koji mu stoje na putu, pa tako i nasjtariju populaciju. Oni vi\u0161e nisu interesna grupa iz koje savremeno dru\u0161tvo mo\u017ee da crpi svoj interes. To su ljudi svesni sebe, svojih godina, iskustva i znanja sticanog decenijama. Njima ne mo\u017eete prodavati neku pri\u010du koja ih ne zanima. A u \u017eivot su se naslu\u0161ali svega i \u010dini se da odlaskom u penziju \u010dovek zaista postaje premoren od svega. Ne ka\u017eem i ne sla\u017eem se da starije generacije odlaskom u penziju okon\u010davaju svoj \u017eivotni vek i da ga ne mogu provesti na odli\u010dan i vrlo konstruktivan na\u010din. Naprotiv! Ali, to su ljudi svesni onoga \u0161to mogu shodno svojim godinama i fizi\u010dkom stanju. Oni nisu zainteresovani za ultra moderne ged\u017eete jer ih vid ve\u0107 izdaje, a brzi razvoj tehnologije lako ih je za samo jednu deceniju isklju\u010dio iz sopstvenog razvoja pa ve\u0107ina njih ne zna kako se ve\u0107ina tehnolo\u0161kih spravica i softvera koristi. Istina, ima i onih koji \"hvataju korak\" sa savremenim re\u0161enjima, ali njima opet ne treba najnoviji telefon, ra\u010dunar ili TV (koji se predstavljaju kvartalno) samo zato \u0161to ima X puta br\u017ee, Y puta ve\u0107e i Z puta ja\u010de ne\u0161to. Ne treba im na tome zamerati. To je prirodan proces, a tehnologija je ve\u0161ta\u010dka. Ne treba o\u010dekivati nerealno. \n\nKako \u0107e izgledati starost svih nas ne samo ovde ve\u0107 bilo gde? Zavisi od nas. Za\u0161to? Zato \u0161to ako odlazak u penziju budemo tretirali kao \"smrtnu presudu\", a ceo svoj \u017eivot posvetili samo poslu bez interesovanja sa strane (porodica, hobi...), javi\u0107e se ogromna praznina u kojoj \u0107emo dozvoliti sebi da sa depresijom i o\u010dajanjem pratimo kako \u017eivot promi\u010de kraj nas, revoltirani na malu penziju. Ljudi moraju da shvate: niko vam ne\u0107e dati bilo kakve garancije  niti ih daje kada ste se rodili - ni koliko \u0107ete \u017eiveti, ni gde \u0107ete \u017eiveti, niti kakvu \u0107ete starost imati. Nije sve do okoline. Mi smo prvi kreatori svog mikro sveta.

There are a lot of very interesting talks and almost everyone present is working on something that would fit hand in glove into the NGI space. This conference, barely advertised outside of the indie-web describes itself as such:\n\n> Data Terra Nemo is a technical conference for hackers and computer scientists focused on distributed and decentralized systems.\n\nYou probably won't go to this conference unless you recognise at least some of the people and projects on the speakers list. It's the bleeding edge of the decentralised web. To quote Alberto from a different context:\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:5, topic:9920\"]\nThe more I hang around the hacker community, the more I think that most of what Europe needs to build a human-centric Internet is already out there. There is a large, diverse, investment-ready portfolio of technologies, companies and NGOs, standards and principles (like ethical design itself) and, most importantly, people. If the EU were to put some of its considerable firepower behind them, we might actually get somewhere in a relatively short time!\n[/quote]\n\n\nI come away from the first day of Data Terra Nemo with much of the same feeling.\n\nThe first DTN was held in 2015, and was largely inspired by the fledgeling Scuttlebutt protocol and other technologies. In just a few years since then, that technology and others have gone from being barely operational proofs of concept to functional prototypes at worst and battle-tested fully fledged technologies at best.\n\nDominic Tarr, original developer of the Scuttlebutt protocol, opened the conference. I want to share some of his experiences here, since they are probably emblematic of how a lot of these radical projects get started \u2013 far away from the Siemens, Googles and Microsofts of the world.\n\nHe told a story of how Scuttlebutt was born out of the almost adolescent punkiness that grew out of the early days of Node.js and the - at the time- crazy idea of using javascript for your entire web stack, backend to frontend. There were, as Dominic joked, no grownups in the room telling them what to do.\n\nWithout getting into technical details about what Scuttlebutt is, I will let their excellent narrative documentation video speak for itself:\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/236358264\n\nThis video hints at something which I find to be really special about Scuttlebutt, but also to an extent Mastodon and other communities that thrive on these platforms. It is that they seem to develop a humanness, community and a certain strand of hopefulness that is very different from the evangelical naivet\u00e9 of Silicon Valley. In Dominics story, he touched upon this, retelling how Scuttlebutt user Zach! had come across a new genre of science fiction called Solar Punk. This hopeful utopian genre   could perhaps best be described as narrative of a society of  high-tech hippies, a blend of high-tech and nature, world-wide-web and wood-wide-web (an apt analogy, used by the great Gina Giampaolo of [Rumors](https://rumo.rs/) in her talk!). This image of the future had integrated deeply into the community of Scuttlebutt, wedding technology to a hopeful narrative for a better future. That's no small accomplishment!\n\nI'll write a few more of these posts on what I've seen at Data Terra Nemo, and I'll try to get some people I meet involved. Projects represented here include a DAT, IPFS, Beaker browser, Web torrent and others. I will try to churn out a few more posts about these too.", "created_at": "2019-05-17 22:25:00.691129", "updated_at": "2020-12-15 12:40:03.372893", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 620, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 265.0, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [53631], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4, 4635, 5117, 2915, 5025], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33451, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 779, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>Your session post is now up to date</b>\n\nHey @Bernard , I totally missed your request.

I am so glad to have found you.  I was sent a link to your call to action on the  Fellowship application on a day or so ago so I apologise firstly for the late submission and secondly for the long post.  Although it\u2019s late I still feel it\u2019s important to post this and become a member of your community.  I also hope that any conversations continue and won\u2019t stop on the deadline today though if they do I look forward to discovering more about the community and I\u2019m looking forward to engaging in other conversations too.\n\nInnovation and technology progression usually means bigger is better but bigger also comes with greater energy demands   So how are we as humans expected to survive in a world already suffering from the demands on its finite resources?\n\nThe impact to the planet is also causing a greater intolerance to our neighbours.  We find ourselves amidst increasing far-right views driven by fear of an uncertain future that is dependent on our precious dwindling resources.\n\nIn my opinion the two real threats to humanity are our **disregard for the environment** and our **disregard for each other**.   Most individuals wouldn\u2019t argue this yet help isn\u2019t coming from the places that could make the most difference.  \n\nFor example, The UK Government want the shiny new technologies - they think 5G, AI and blockchain will secure an economy by attracting global industry to UK shores but it\u2019s a misconception that this will solve any problems, all it does is create more. They\u2019re sold the ideas from capitalist machinery that operates without any regards for humanity, and they don\u2019t have the means or will to challenge what they are being sold.  They don\u2019t want to think differently, they want to be told how to think.\n\nThe world is being nurtured on capitalist values; scaling vertically, making things bigger can only result in a survival of the fittest or a type of natural selection where those creating these changes consider themselves to be the fittest.   The help isn\u2019t coming from those who could help the most and it won\u2019t. It\u2019s up to us.  \n\nWe need to do more with less and we need to innovate to do this.  We need to challenge the general material and consumer driven values and demonstrate that the likes of health, community and purpose have more meaning and reward.  \n\nBecause I have worked at the level of very overarching questions I need to be careful not to just reframe the question of how we make a more human-centric internet.  If I try to be more specific I would frame this as:\n\nWhat technology innovations (infrastructure/hardware/software)  could be invested in to ensure that we reduce the demands on natural resources to sustainable levels whilst we enable humanity to thrive and live harmoniously alongside each other?  And how do we make whatever solution so attractive that it is readily adopted by society at scale?\n\nMaybe this question is too broad - a rather random set of considerations include: cheap to build low-powered devices and networks, technology that lasts many years rather than just a few, tech investment decisions based on human-centric standards, personal data pods and distributed applications, cooperatives, skills trades, collective action and intelligence, altering value systems,  building sustainable local communities.\n\nI propose to work with a team to explore this question in detail or to join in with a team who are already exploring elements of this.  The work may be to bring together disparate work into a consolidated package and to design an attractive and scalable product that could be readily adopted by society and easily incorporated into peoples lives.\n\nFor me the fellowship would integrate me into a community that appears to be directly addressing the concerns I\u2019ve been trying to address in the wrong places.  The financial element would allow me to dedicate time to the questions that this campaign has raised.  I\u2019m on a sabbatical from the UK Government, I feel like a student at the moment - the intention is to find the communities, movements and causes that can I fully get behind and collaborate with on this type of work.", "created_at": "2019-05-30 18:40:21.883021", "updated_at": "2019-07-01 16:44:40.983764", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 713, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 245.2, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3067, 4, 2915, 4022, 5139, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19557, "user_id": 62, "topic_id": 1477, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>BAD UPDATE....MACAO NEEDS SUPPORT!</b>\n\nAccording to the newspaper it seems that this morning , early in the morning of course, police came to evict MACAO; some occupants would probably be denounced for occupation of public space.Some (always according to the newspaper....which I don't trust so much....) are still inside.\n\nDemonstration in support are going on outside the Torre Galfa!\n\nPlease Alessia if you have more \"direct\" news could you share with us?!?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-15 09:27:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.035698", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 83, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11458], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72806, "user_id": 2460, "topic_id": 12971, "post_number": 17, "raw": "This civil servants point seems like scenario where there is not a sense of purpose that connects people and gives agency.

When it comes to POPREBEL there are more obstacles, mainly related to the low engagement of the ethnographers from the partner institutions (the Serbian team is not very reactive or motivated and the UCL team is struggling in finding time to do the work). In the case of the UCL, we are in the process of finding a solution, hopefully a Polish ethnographer will be hired soon, but in the case of Serbia we will need to make a decision wheather to pursue this task or not. It is something that can be discussed in the next consortium meeting happening in March 2020. \n- John proposed to reflect deeper on the type of people we want to see more engaged in the NGI discussions in the next year. \n- The ethnographers will think of ways on being more active in the processes of community managers and help to ask people to reflect on topics in a different way - there are a lots of discussions about general topics and asking more specific questions about people's experiences would help uncover nuances.\n- Alberto: in relation to the informed consent for research participation and [this discussion](https://edgeryders.eu/t/documenting-our-new-procedures-to-acquire-informed-consent-to-participating-in-research/11908) - no action is currently needed, the ethics advisors will provide their feedback, but it's something to pay close attention to in future.\n- Noemi: the focus will be shifted in the next year and the new teams hired probably in the later stage as the decisions have still not been made. \n\n**A few things to pay attention to in the upcoming period:** \n\n- all team leaders and their members: **by the end of the year, make sure you reported correct number of hours, for the WP(s) you are working for and invoiced correct corresponding amount**. I am using [this excel document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cD8QM4XoaUMCJ22fyYRyQFNl6pv2-VY-2vUlSXehEKA/edit#gid=0) to keep track of the staff and the parameters, you can refer to it if needed. \n- there will be a few changes in the contracts for the next year, the main proposal is to **seperate the two projects** and their budgets + add in the annex detailed parameters for each (the number of hours to officially report, WP, monthly amount to invoice etc., so that is more clear than it was this year). \n- there might be the additional change needed in relation to the article 10 (in our standard contracts), but this is to be confirmed (currently waiting for some answers). \n- new contracts will be signed digitally beginning of January. Make sure no one signs the contract after the date he/she started working and reporting the time. The date of the signature of the contract has to always be prior to the beginning of the work. Otherwise, we need to sign the contracts in paper. \n- there are two **magic budgets** we are currently using: [NGI Forward](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17oEnC3Aq_k5DjwcwUdfdwGYrNMXSqVmLpZHpkY1-JH0/edit#gid=784954257) & [POPREBEL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uJ1gPo-apDgWLAbm_6CFfDYpV6ysfl33feItocuoP0c/edit#gid=784954257). This is to have the overview of the entire budget and cash flow predictions. What team leaders should note is that we also use it to keep track of the changes in budget allocations. It means that **in cases you are changing the budget category or using the budget in a different way than initially planned, ONLY then your input is needed here.** The instructions on how to do this are [HERE](https://edgeryders.eu/t/creating-and-managing-a-budget/9097#heading--2-4). It will be very helpful if you as a team leader could pay attention of the use of your budgets in this way. \n- **paying services**: during the Festival, a lot of events took place in many different cities and it was challenging to respect all the rules when it comes to paying a service provider. The team leaders should be those to have these rules in mind and make sure the team members who are involved in organization of the events respect all the procedures. This is important to note for the future. As Matt suggested we will create a wiki with some tips&tricks, but before I will try to ensure that the \"hacks\" we find to facilitate these processes are actually possible. In the meantime, please stick to the process described [HERE](https://edgeryders.eu/t/horizon-2020-project-coordination-manual/8913#heading--5) (under \"rules for avoiding conflicts of interest\"). I would also appreciate if you would remind your team members to upload the justifications that they have for the Festival as described in these instructions. \n- Finally, in the next year, we will maintain the biweekly Horizon team calls. \n\n@alberto @nadia @noemi @johncoate @amelia @matthias", "created_at": "2019-12-02 10:11:51.926339", "updated_at": "2019-12-02 10:11:51.926339", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 847, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 79.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60272, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10958, "post_number": 8, "raw": "meh, make a video call is not a big deal - it can be a short intro, maybe @hugi can do the dense networks talk to make clear where we are going and a q&a/group discussion after?", "created_at": "2019-10-01 12:07:14.175398", "updated_at": "2019-10-01 12:07:14.175398", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 38, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 7.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [60271], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30333, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1030, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Yes!</b>\n\nAbsolutely, James. And more: as Nassim Taleb explained to us with great eloquence, finance makes the most money in the highest variance contexts. VC wants you to win very big or fail, it's not interested in you making a comfortable living while doing meaningful work. Consequently (and rationally), they prefer for 9 investments to fail and for the 10th to return 2000% (overall return: 20%)\u00a0than for 10\u00a0investments out of 10 to succeed with a 15% return rate (overall return: 15%). This why\u00a0they love scalability and \"winner-takes-it-all\" markets on the web.\u00a0\n\nIt is a myth that the interests of VCs and those of entrepreneurs align. It does not pay to lovingly groom a new idea and watch it blossom into a company. What it does pay is squeeze it into a 90 seconds pitch, then see if the next round of investment comes along. If it does, get out; if not, ditch it. They want 9/10ths of you to fail... hardly your best friends, at least in a stochastic sense.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-26 20:04:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.061833", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 188, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30022], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66585, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 12071, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Much appreciated, thanks @marina!", "created_at": "2019-12-02 10:13:42.660803", "updated_at": "2019-12-02 10:13:42.660803", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 23.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4096], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62131, "user_id": 5487, "topic_id": 11214, "post_number": 3, "raw": "My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce zamkni\u0119cie gimnazj\u00f3w to dobra decyzja, niestety reforma zosta\u0142a nieudolnie przeprowadzona.

Sorry we missed one another during the festival. I kept being hungry after the shows so left without having a drink :(\n\nI read the enspiral post, it was interesting- \u00a0thanks for sharing! You're right, it's not the tools but\u00a0people. There's some valuable advice in there, maybe we can try some of them out here. But this term, emotional labour, it feels like\u00a0\n\nWhen we were in Matera with unMon, a local pharmacist held a lecture about the old\u00a0system of community provided healthcare. And why it disappeared with modernity. According to him it\u00a0was basically held together by the need to manage an important resource- water.\n\nIn Matera there is a huge man-made underground reservoir of water, and a system for accessing it through wells. Each well is situated in a courtyard shared by a number of individual family houses. They collectively manage their shared well and according to him this was the key reason as to why there was\u00a0such a strong sense of neighbourhood and mutual care amongst residents. Because of the day to day interaction and mutual dependence on one another to responsibly manage the shared resource. When the state moved people into modern dwelling (in the 80's?) then they had running water etc. No need for daily interaction and no dependency - the system broke.\n\nThey also did things like ran communal bakeries instead of having individual ovens. I would say these are examples of cultures of collaboration born out of material necessity. This has been consistent with my own experience around how collaboration happens. It doesn't happen without a compelling reason... The enspiral crowd is running an interesting experiment. It seems to work within one context where people have aligned interests and a compelling driver of\u00a0collaboration (economic activity), possibly other things too?\n\nSo how do you build it if you live in societies where people's material needs are mostly satisfied?

It is very nice too meet you too and thank you for reading and reacting to what i wrote. Thank you for your appreciations.\n\nWell, I want to say that there are no special tricks, you just have to show you're motivated enough. First time when I applied I had no experince, but when I applied in Brussels I tryed to put more attention on how to write a motivation letter, how to improve my CV and so on. So, there are some standards that you have to take into account but also you must prove that you really whant to do this and what are your qualities. But you know how we say, it's easy to get in , the more important is to get out succesfully. You have to show your interest, to keep up with what your professors says etc.\n\nAbout the jobs, again it's your motivation. Of course it's not easy to find a job and the studies that I am doing are good for the profile that employers are looking for, but there are not enough. You have to be involved in different activities, know people, make yourself known, be active. Me, for example, I try to participate at debates, conferences at European Parlament, I try to know better the situation from inside. Plus you can start with an internship. And if you study hard enough you can try the competition for EU institutions. But I repeat, the informations are transparent for everyone, and it depends on your perseverance.\n\nLet me give you an example, recently I participated at a very interesting seminar for me about how to build your own business (this is one of my other goals, I want to have a family business) and I found out many interesting things about it ... for example there is an Erasmus program for that (like internships in different firms from different countries), there are special founds for women who want to begin an affair etc.\n\nAnother example is a seminar about democracy where we debated the problem of Moldova and the possibilities to entry the EU, I tryed to expose the problems that Moldova is confrunting with and the possible solutions.\n\nFew days ago I went to a projection of movies that accentued actual problems, like women discrimination or poverty and how to change it.\n\nMeanwhile, I found a student job and I am working periodicaly (but this is after sending more than 30 CVs )\n\nBut nobody says to you, hey, go there and say that. It depends on you and your motivation, really. Everyone have equal chances, but not all use the given possibilities.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHope I answerd to your questions. If you have other, write me, I will be glad to answer.\n\nHave a nice evening!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-02 14:39:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:03.558930", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 496, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 43642, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8437, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I also read the work plan, @Dorsaf.

Will some people (maybe just one person) need to be paid from day one? Or do you think you can start in a purely voluntary way, given the space and equipment?\n\nYou also need a section 4.2 with the actual work plan, i.e. the activities that Nebras would carry out.

Setting up another event on the install only takes a minute. This platform is ready for beta users to try out. It's still in development, so you will need to have some oversight with things changing and moving. That said, we use this in production ourselves, so it's in our best interest to keep it functional. \n\nWe can also set up an event on Dreams to automatically accept all users who have bought a ticket to an event, granted that they use Pretix. That might come with some costs though since the integration equals developer hours for the project, but one possibility could be to [use the Blivande Pretix](https://tickets.blivande.com/blivande/always-becoming/) install and allow us to take a cut to pay @gustav for the integration.  \n\nSo, are there any Edgeryders projects that could use this? Could we even include this tech and methodology in WP for future proposals? It could fit well into the sort of ideas floating around EarthOS or the OCI Lab.

Consider a bet that looks like this:\n\n* Start with 100 EUR\n* At each period, toss a fair coin. Heads => your money goes up 50%. Tails => your money goes down 40%.\n\n* Averaging over a large number of people playing the bet `N`times, the value of this bet is the (traditional) expected value of its payoff, i.e. `100 x (1. 0.05)^N`. Your wealth grows exponentially at a 5% rate.\n* Averaging over a long time, the value of this bet is -100: you lose all your wealth.\n\nPeters uses it to explain loss aversion, currently thought to be a deviation from perfect rationality.\n\nI have cobbled up some Python code to try it. The range of 1000, of course, can be replaced with anything. If you want a biased coin, you can enter the odds you want as an argument of the `coinToss()` function.\n\n```\nimport random\ndef coinToss(odds=0.5):\n    '''\n    (float ) => bool\n    returns True with probability equal to odds \n    '''\n    flip = random.random()\n    if flip > odds:\n        return True\n    else: \n        return False\n\nwealth = 100\nfor i in range(1000):\n    toss = coinToss()\n    if toss == True:\n        wealth += wealth * .5\n    else: \n        wealth -= wealth * .4 \n    print wealth\n```\nAn interesting question is which trend is stronger. What happens when you average a large population, each member of which averages over a long time? Increasing the size of the population makes the average payoff go up; increasing the time duration of the bet makes each individual payoff go down. Which of the two trends is stronger?\n\nI played with incorporating this code into various loops. In the end, a totally non-scientific, back-of-the-envelope test was this:\n\n* Take 10 populations of 10,000 people starting with a wealth of 1.\n* Make everyone play the Peters bet for N periods.\n* At the end of each N, count the number of people that ended up with more than 1, i.e. more than their initial endowment. \n* Let the model run for `N = 100`, then `N = 1,000`, then `N = 10,000`.\n\nResults:\n\n\n\n\n```\nnumber of time periods: 100\n\nAverage of average outcomes across all populations: 42.161242451\n\nAverage number of people who increased their wealth across all \npopulations, normalized for population size: 0.1349\n\nExpected value of the bet: 131.501257846\n***********************\nnumber of time periods: 1000\nAverage of average outcomes across all populations: 2.76743582216\nAverage number of people who increased their wealth across all \npopulations, normalized for population size: 0.00015\nExpected value of the bet: 1.54631892073e+21\n**********\nnumber of time periods: 10000\nAverage of average outcomes across all populations: 2.42586953452e-149\nAverage number of people who increased their wealth across all \npopulations, normalized for population size: 0.0\nExpected value of the bet: 7.81611065843e+211\n```", "created_at": "2020-01-25 15:50:13.678965", "updated_at": "2020-12-04 15:44:05.827416", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 459, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 21.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [69353], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19431, "user_id": 2916, "topic_id": 5029, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:18.0pt;margin-left:\n\n0cm\"><span>Contracts: Alberto, what is the difference between temps contract and subcontracting?

Above, I was just discussing (with my usual wandering style ;) ) what would be the most promising area to propose this idea, as I understand that it is actually a policy proposal that we want to make it into the real world. So I ruled out employment policy as unfitting for now, but did not get on the social policy one.\n\n(In retrospect I did not get on the \"social policy\" idea because here in Germany, we had some reforms 10 years ago (\"Harts\" laws) that merged social benefits into unemployment benefits, with the effect that this system now tries to push every individual in need back into an employee position and uses a lot of force (sanctioning) for that. So it was too easy to forget for a moment that a state has or should have an interest to care for people \"not falling too much off the cracks\" even without respect to the employment paradigm.)\n\n<em>Something else:</em> I remember that I made two policy / project proposals related to this self-help community idea in a recent crowd-sourcing effort for policy proposals, done by Angela Merkel.

So that  (LOC) anticipate the number of turtles they will rescue from each of their rescue sites as part of their \u201cBy-Catch Release\u201d program.\n\nTo train the model, the data set was mainly historical data on the number of turtles rescued from each site from 1998 until 2018. To date, Local Ocean Conservation has released over 10,000 sea turtles.\n\nAn accurate prediction will enable Local Ocean Conservation to allocate staff and resources more efficiently. This challenge was hosted on the first data science competition platform in Africa: *Zindi*.\n\nSo in collaboration with *IEEE Sup\u2019Com Student Branch*, *Zindi ambassadors*, *Edgeryders community members in Tunis*, and *OCI labs*, the first edition of this event was scheduled to take place at the *Higher School of Communications of Tunis* (Sup\u2019Com) on November the 30th 2019.\n\nIndeed, there were Data Science mentors that helped and guided the participants to develop successful solutions. Mainly, they were a selection of skillful and competent data scientists and Kaggle experts, from whom we mention: *Mohamed Salem Djdidi*, *Alaeddine Ayadi*, *Seif Fezzani*, *Sirine Bouslema*, and *Firas baba.*\n\n![74591090_416688625884848_2452087624895037440_n|690x459](upload://r4BU8wd9Qf7zrrLi7UkrxJo15k1.jpeg) \n\nAs the vice-chair of IEEE Sup\u2019Com SB and a co-organizer, it was a delight to contribute, me, and our student branch, in the success of this advantageous hackathon. We split the tasks concerning the logistics and media; moreover, we posted the event on Facebook on November 22nd. We ensured that it reached the maximum of people by sharing the description and multiple posts. Besides, we opened registration on the following day and closed it on November 26th. It was remarkable that many people were intrigued by the theme of this challenge. We received 108 applicants. They were students, for the most part, that had common knowledge in programming and machine learning.\n\nAccording to the statistics, 40% of the participants were undergraduate students, 29.5% engineering students, 18.5% master\u2019s students, 10% fresh graduates, and 2% professionals.\n\n![1|690x290](upload://pCAXGMVHnscIgd58zUuoElD1Rcu.png) \n\nConcerning the process of preselection, we accepted the applicants according to their resume, their passion, and motivation regarding solving ecological challenges using data science. Only 55 were admitted due to limited seating and fairly-narrowed budget, which is typical for the first edition of any event. The final number of participants that attended the competition was 44 and was composed of 36% of females and 64% males.\n\nOn November the 30th, the event started at 9:30 am by welcoming and presenting the contestants and introducing the previously-mentioned partners and mentors, followed by an Ice-breaker game on https://listen.edgeryders.eu/ platform, the attendees were a bit confused at first despite the fact that the link was stated in an email sent the night before, perhaps it would have been more practical if it was sent a few days earlier. Yet, they enjoyed the team building activity because it helped them get to know each other and facilitate the process of networking later on. \n\n![IMG_9399|690x459](upload://d4Q57Iou5GrneyTsuKIIVKp9hhb.jpeg) \n\nBy the end of the presentation, Ms. Zmorda Djdidi talked about OCI LAB and the advantages and opportunities it offers to such talented youth to make a difference in their countries.\n\n![IMG_9407|690x459](upload://tBF0um7I9ZqJSUxNRz8wedI9yit.jpeg) \n\nAfterward, Med Salem Djedidi, the Zindi ambassador, and Firas Baba started presenting the challenge and explaining it while the participants took time to familiarize with the Zindi platform and the contest theme which, in their own words, not the typical kind of data science competitions, as it was based on real-life data.\n\nFor more information about the challenge you can visit: [ Sea Tortule rescue forecast challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/sea-turtle-rescue-forecast-challenge)\n\n![4|690x419](upload://nDFuB4FtJCUO3BgAyj0iHByKD5E.jpeg) \n\nDuring lunchtime, the participants kept networking in a cozy atmosphere. Still, they hungrily rushed back to their computers to finish working on their models.\n\n![77423143_457522858238893_5841758870975807488_n|690x517](upload://6zerGiCrFOK8rltyFByJ8Y5O5tj.jpeg) \n\nSoon after, the scores on the leaderboard got interesting and the vibes of friendly competitiveness were filling the room. \n\n![5|690x156](upload://kTFiN7ZQAGU3HKBThzclnFe61Zi.png) \n*Public Leader Board at 4 pm*\n\n**The mentors\u2019 tips:**\n\nThrough the 12 hours challenge, our mentors have provided the participants with tips to : \n- Clean and built the training data set \n- How to evaluate the performance of their predictive model\n- Introduced some tips on feature engineering\n  \nThe tips will be shared by our mentors on a separate post.\n\nTowards the end of the competition, the private leaderboard at 8 pm revealed the winners of this significant challenge:\n\n![PNG|690x320](upload://msdjj7xH4nsj7iz6HZByfNGsQcH.jpeg) \n*Private Leaderboard at 8 pm*\n\n***The winners*:** \n\nAfter 12 hours of hard work and determination, the top winners get to finally receive their rewards provided by Zindi.Africa. The 3 prizes are respectively 500DT, 300DT and 200DT vouchers.\n\n**Aziz Belkhir**, a final year computer science engineering student at the National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT), got the *first place*. He has a grand passion for data science. Plus, he participated in multiple AI hackathons, also familiar with the Zindi platform. He liked the idea of manipulating real data therefore he decided to participate in this particular one.  \n\nConcerning his solution, his strategy was to focus on each capture site and study its related data, also checked the average number of turtles to be caught in each site.\n\n![79083213_439342177017623_7176261503979356160_n|460x690](upload://2XiLN18vIyNLNVbFFjDiIjF1S0H.jpeg) \n\nAs for the *second-place* winner, **Oussama Fakhfakh**, a final year IT engineering student at Sup\u2019Com. A hardworking young man, he stated that he attended many data-science online courses in his free time and was looking forward to practicing the skills he acquired, and this competition was his chance to do that. As for the solution, he applied feature engineering techniques  and hyperparameter tuning in his models, and used an ensembling method called \"Averaging\" in which  he  implemented Lightgbm and Xgboost and  then have taken the average of prediction of these two models.\n\n![78743688_541291180056031_9119410682712817664_n|690x460](upload://drqXRYsA1TVlrV3sw2OXjoh3VTa.jpeg) \n\nLast but not least, the *third prize* went to a team of two girls **Souha Gaaloul**, a fresh graduate student with a computer science degree from the National School of Engineering of Carthage and **Nermine Ali**, a  computer science  engineering student majoring in data science at ESPRIT.\n\n**Souha** was captivated by this challenge because she was excited about the idea of using technology for social impact and especially for something as important as saving those creatures. Our planet, she insists, needs us youngsters to take action to save it.\nHer solution for the challenge is a regression model predicting the number of turtles to be rescued in each week of 2019. She utilized a random forest model since it is less likely to overfit. Her partner **Nermine** tried a CatBootRegressor but it didn't do as well in generalizing to the test data so they agreed on the Random Forest solution. She believes the model would have performed better if they had more time to work on it.\n\nAs for her partner **Nermine**, a curious young lady who likes to be challenged and perceive to what extent she could reach in a limited time duration. She also affirms that she wanted to prove that female engineers are capable of anything they put their minds to.\n\n![79836431_2526452284265797_3168101081645318144_n|690x459](upload://fDHHN9N8HpEmNaRg1afSaLk7rQZ.jpeg) \n\nPlease check the repositories on *GitHub* links below :\n\n(in progress)\n\n*First place*: \n*Second place*: **[https://github.com/FMadridista1996/Hack-for-earth-](https://github.com/FMadridista1996/Hack-for-earth-?fbclid=IwAR0W90UccP-CyOf51d-YsETsR0NbjAS8Ci4Gm0S8DRdDvdhhyv3jARJthUE)** \n*Third place* : **https://github.com/souhagaa/Sea-Turtle-Rescue-Forecast-Challenge**\n\nFinally the event concluded with having goodbye drinks and a photo shooting session. Some of the contestants also were discussing the difference between typical data science competitions and real life problems. Usually, the only metric that is important is accuracy. However, real world data science work requires a careful trade-off between factors such as cost, model return on investment, model latency, and model scalability.\n\n**Participants' feedback:**  \n\nMost of the participants\u2019 feedback about the competition was about how well-organized it was, and praised the good quality of internet connection and food. Nearly all of them agree that the challenge was very interesting. However, some think that it involved a lot of data manipulation and that it should have been a more-than-twelve-hours challenge if they wanted an optimal solution. They insisted that if the goal of the challenge was to get the finest results, then the training and test should have been provided but if the goal was to see who can manipulate data and create a good-to-go model in little time then that purpose is achieved. Also a few considered a good amount of data to be useless, yet it wasn\u2019t a surprise since it was a real life data.\n\nOverall, they enjoyed the event a lot and were happy to be part of it.\n\n**What is next?**\nThe code of the 4 participants will be reviewed in the following three days by our mentors.\nAfter the submission validation, Syrine and Mohamed, our mentors, with Local Ocean Conservation will improve and validate the POC and set up an action plan to deploy the predictive model.\nFrom the IEEE side, we are enthusiastic about future collaboration within the Zindi and Edgeryders community toward a long term collaboration.  \n \n\n**Special thanks** goes to *Zindi.Africa*, *OCI labs*, *Edgeryders community* and *IEEE Sup\u2019Com SB* for assuring a pleasant flow of this event. Also, much appreciation is dedicated to the mentors who worked hard to keep everyone well informed and helped guide the contestants throughout the competition. \n\nSurely, we value the *media coverage* made by *Reuters*, in which they interviewed Ms Zmorda Djedidi and Khouloud Ouesleti about the hackathon.", "created_at": "2019-12-03 11:42:29.882042", "updated_at": "2019-12-03 11:42:29.882042", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1711, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 473.0, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3703, 8, 4664, 6068, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34700, "user_id": 2406, "topic_id": 1003, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hi\nthat looks interesting, I will drop by one of these days\nB\u00e4rbel", "created_at": "2017-08-24 22:06:45.639581", "updated_at": "2017-08-24 22:06:45.639581", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4834, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4801, "post_number": 1, "raw": "So it is now time to submit a proposal to the <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/2015/09/14/32c3-call-for-participation-de/\">Chaos Communication Congress</a> and I think this would be a perfect opportunity to kickstart the conversation in the relevant hacker communities. <a href=\"/u/lakomaa\">@Lakomaa</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>\u00a0myself and others in the Edgeryders were there and can verify that in addition to being <strong>ALOT</strong> of fun, it is pretty much the most economic way to recruit participants and partners for the project if we do a killer talk which includes an invitation to join us at LOTE5.\n\nThe deadline for submissions is September 30.

Write a new version of importFromDiscourse class which creates a subgraph with the given project tag as a property of all objects, and only removes the objects with a label that is passed as a parameter.\n2. Rewrite the import classes in the [settings route libraries](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-api/tree/master/routes/settings) to handle building and updating the subgraphs of a passed project tag.\n3. Verify that this works as expected by importing at least two projects, and then hard-updating one of them, keeping track of the Neo4j database and comparing it to the numbers for the single-tenant versions.\n4. Update queries for all route classes, functions and reconfiguring the routes to be aware of what tag is being called. There are 15 libraries, and all of them contain 2-7 classes each with their own Cypher queries.  One example to illustrate is the GetPosts class in the post_getter library, where the following Cypher query:  \n\n\t```MATCH (p:post)<-[:AUTHORSHIP]-(u:user) RETURN p.post_id AS post_id, p.title AS title, p.content AS content, p.timestamp AS timestamp, u.user_id AS user_id```\n\t\n\tWould be updated to specify only looking for posts with the property {ssn_id: x}, where x is the passed id of the project. Some of these updates are similar, but they need to be handled one at a time. There are about 200 lines of Cypher code in all of the routes combined, and most lines probably need to be updated.\n\t\n\t\n5. Each of the route classes must be updated to take a parameter to pass the ssn_id property to the queries. A good consistent way of doing this should be decided on before going ahead.\n6. All Cypher queries in all classes of the graphtulip module must be updated. Many of these are a lot more complicated than the route queries. One example to illustrate are the very long composite queries in the [createtlp library](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-api/blob/61d7de08edb36586751d31e78035a5734db1d341/graphtulip/createtlp.py). Before these are updated, I need to understand how graphtulip works in more detail.\n7. Routes for tulipr need to be updated\n8. Tulip files need to be sent to the dashboard with ids that make it possible for the dashboard to tell project files apart.\n9. Everything needs to be pulled together and tested extensively, and compared with single-tenant equivalents.\n\nMy estimate is that:\n\n* 1,2,3 would take about 1 week.\n\n* 4,5 would take about 2 weeks. \n\n* 6,7,8 would take between 2 to 4 weeks.\n\n* 9 would take about 1 week.", "created_at": "2020-01-06 20:10:15.739024", "updated_at": "2020-01-06 22:34:23.493644", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 455, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84394, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 14445, "post_number": 44, "raw": "It's easy enough to mention it to whomever we sign up at the time they make the leap.", "created_at": "2020-10-05 16:36:43.392216", "updated_at": "2020-10-05 16:36:43.392216", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 36.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [84386], "is_liked_by": [3323, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66774, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 12087, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@sirine_bouslama @Meds.jedidi1 @nadia", "created_at": "2019-12-03 11:50:51.809242", "updated_at": "2019-12-03 11:50:51.809242", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 37.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4664], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65169, "user_id": 5789, "topic_id": 11735, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Ask the person who is speaking right now what their name is, and if they already have an edgeryders.eu account?

Funny enough I was just procrastinating by listening to a video on procastination. I think it is long and general enough that various people could get something out of it. Just to address the \"getting things done\" angle. :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KysVad2dr-c\n\nOn face vs screen, etc. I think you are right that certain methods work better (or just more comfortably?) with some people (on some topics). You'll get different discussions and different outcomes. I think face to face helps my mirror neurons fire up fully. I often feel I can only really fully develop many aspects of a thought in a discussion. On the other hand I also like to listen to a recorded discussion afterwards and focus my thought much more on certain aspects without being afraid I have to answer some question or lose track of a discussion. I can be fully in observer mode and my thinking is much more like if I am editing someone else's text and want examine and fix every little bit of imprecision.\n\nAnother thing that could make face to face meetings different is that you can smell the person and the environment. Also a LOT of our nervous system is connected to the stomach/digestive tract (the face and brain came way later!) so I would not be surprised if there is more purpose to business/conference dinners than to knock out the prefrontal cortex a little (althought that can also help).\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-11 21:51:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.926998", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 269, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30441], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66029, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11104, "post_number": 8, "raw": "@matthias can you get rid of the \"Get tickets\" button please?

It\u2019s a useful descriptor for my \u201cstupidly simple\u201d proposal. Below are a few of the principles - still high level, but I hope this helps you grasp further what I\u2019m getting at. The tactical mechanics and business model etc are absent, partly because I want to see what emerges over the weekend in those areas.\n\nKONNEKT is a psychosocial ecosystem for giving  *everyone*  in the world a basic field kit for living more consciously, more conscientiously, and more courageously, and to train them to use it consistently, in support of sustainable human joy. This is not a replacement for many other approaches, it is a framework within which other benevolent approaches to human self-organisation can be aligned and integrated.\n\nCurrent global conditions call for unprecedented systemic solutions.\n\nProtest is necessary and useful, but will not build the ark or help us navigate the uncharted waters ahead.\n\nUnlike previously, human neurological evolutionary capacity does not contain within it the means to spontaneously generate humane solutions to the complexity of problems we face today, or with the urgency required - these must be designed, deployed, adopted, and adapted consciously and deliberately.\n\nAccordingly, we can - literally and figuratively - no longer be left to our own devices: we must help each other to help ourselves by sharing the feeling-thinking-doing process, and KONNEKT is a call for a grand alliance of changemakers, teachers, parents, leaders, and entrepreneurs to that end.\n\nThere is a recursive pattern of three fundamental value domains inherent to the life process and its subsystems. All our efforts, down the ages, have been recapitulations of this pattern in myriad competing forms, across different horizontal and increasingly co-existing vertical states of complexity.\n\nThere are many hundreds of triads of words pointing to these domains - two of the simplest are  *context-concept-concrete*  , and  *love-logic-labour*  .\n\nThis protocol can be heuristically represented by three universal symbolic attential injunctions which can be applied fractally at all scales, from the intrapersonal to the planetary.\n\nThese injunctions together form an algorithm which is also distillation of many known principles of benevolent human well-being and interaction, and comprise the roots of many familiar methodologies in use today, from the scientific method, to coaching, to software development, to philosophy, to humanistic psychology, to team-building.\n\nKonnekting is the name for this reductionist process which automatically activates prosocial systems in people. By individually and collectively training our attention directly and deliberately across these three domains, and building a planetary cultural habit of konnekting as the primary human activity, we may collaborate more effectively towards shared embodied and enacted \u201cends values\u201d such as joyful regenerative ecological living, and minimise or eliminate the entropy and suffering otherwise generated by worldview-driven competition over arbitrary ego-involving \u201cmeans values\u201d.\n\nThe game is to induce leaders and their tribes to join us and explicitly konnekt across silos, communities, knowledge domains, organisations, and borders, putting mind and body in the service of shared rational and ethical life-sustaining purposes, through collective embodied attentional engagement with heart, head, and hands.", "created_at": "2019-11-22 20:00:03.139763", "updated_at": "2019-11-23 06:03:10.267791", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 532, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 36.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [64750], "is_liked_by": [4934, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65466, "user_id": 5859, "topic_id": 11817, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643\u0645 .\n\u0641\u0627\u0637\u0645\u0629 \u0645\u062d\u0628\u0648\u0628 \u060c24 \u0633\u0646\u0629\u060c\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0629 \u0628\u0633\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u062a\u062e\u0635\u0635 \"\u062a\u0623\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0628\u064a\u062f\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062d\u0629 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0626\u0629\" \u060c\u062d\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062c\u0627\u0632\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u062f\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0646\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0629.\n\u0641\u0643\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639\u064a \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0648\u062d\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639 \u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0639\u0627\u0626\u062f\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0648\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u0633\u0648\u064a\u0642 \u0648 \u0628\u064a\u0639 \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0648\u062c\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062c\u064a\u0629.\n\n\n\n\nplease find here my link : \nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fkuBKZMTXC2by16tUHijRUlHyOxotSvF?usp=sharing", "created_at": "2019-11-23 18:45:12.273691", "updated_at": "2019-11-23 18:45:12.273691", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 61, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65253, "user_id": 5810, "topic_id": 11754, "post_number": 1, "raw": "U\u017e to bude rok, co do na\u0161ich \u017eivot\u016f vplul p\u0159ekvapiv\u011b rychle n\u00e1\u0161 druhorozen\u00fd a st\u00e1le mu dlu\u017e\u00edm seps\u00e1n\u00ed porodn\u00edho p\u0159\u00edb\u011bhu.

What are you working on and why are you at the Internet Days?**\n\nI am at the internet days because there are interesting speakers and to meet my network in this context. People who work with digital and social media. I'm a communicator. I have a strong commitment to promoting girls to apply to the tech sector, and this spring I will be doing a 12 week program to become a Java developer!\n\n**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**\n\nWhen I saw Edgeryder's graph visualization. It makes me happy to see how you can visualize what is otherwise intangible. Thinking of eg Hampus Brynolf made visualizations over the Swedish Twitter census. Previously, it was possible to get data from Twitter's API, and he picked out what different contexts Swedish twitters belonged to and what they had in common.\n\n**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**\n\nWhen I see people writing with a narrowminded worldview. The problem with unpleasant, misogynous, socially maladaptive people is that 30 years ago they sat in some basement and were strange they had no choice but to socialize into a community or be alone. Today, they can instead find each other and build a community around those values.\n\nThere is a big positive side to it, of course. The revenge of the nerds.

This document contains notes, curated by [Edgeryders](https://ngi.edgeryders.eu/) in the context of the [NGI Forward](https://research.ngi.eu/) project, but open to the contribution of all.\n\nModerator is @RobvanKranenburg.\n\n## Oskar van Deventer \u2013 Self-sovereign identities\n\nMany organizations are administration factories. Every time you interact with them, they ask you for information, which then they process (name, email, phone number).\n\nThere is a different way to do it. People have an information wallet, and orgs ask the wallet for exactly the information they need, not more. People can comply, or decline, or even report excessive requests for information. This is a SSI.\n\nThis ecosystem consists of issuers, holders, and verifiers of identities. Oskar has a demo based on the story of a patient ordering drugs online. The eSSIF-Lab EU project provides funding for technology development and business applications based on this idea. The first open call is going out in early 2020.\n\nQ: How would the data storage work? Some kind of citizen wallet, but how do you implement it?\n\nA: The concept we are working on lives on issuer DBs, accessed through a phone app.\n\nQ: What prevents service providers from asking for all of the individual&rsquo;s data, and the person accepts because she needs the service?\n\nA: This is my nightmare. You cross the Chinese or US border, and then some kind of data vacuum cleaner empties your wallet. This might require issuers policy, stating once and for all what can be done with those data. But I do not yet know how to solve it.\n\n## Ga\u00eblle le Gars\n\nI want to share with you how the Commission sees this issue now.\n\nThere are two major trends that have undesirable consequences. One is social credit scoring. In Europe we are likely to see a &ldquo;consumer scoring&rdquo; version of it. Companies share information on you as a consumer, determining whether you are an undesirable customer. Undesirables are ostracized, made to wait for help, unacknowledged. This is illegal, but the infrastructure is there (it is GAFA), so we suspect this is happening.\n\nThe other trend is the integration of identification databases across the EU on the grounds of police and justice administration. There is a regulation for interoperability of these DBs across the EU, including a lot of info (like: travel information).\n\nHowever, there are also two opportunities. One is e-government applications; the other is that this is now a centerpiece of EU policy, so things can happen to defuse these risks.\n\nQ: How does EIDAS play into these scenarios?\n\nA: (Loretta) It is time that you people \u2013 not the Smart City crowd, not the IoT crowd \u2013 take control of this issue. There is something profoundly human about freedom from surveillance, and identity is political. Speak up, and apply for funding if you have ideas to implement in this space.\n\n[Round of presentations follows]\n\n## Maria Rautavirta: Human centric data economy\n\n* Re-using personal data creates new business opportunities\n* But people should be included in the decisions about what is done with their data.\n* Currently it&rsquo;s mostly open data that are being exchanged. All other data does not travel much, in sits in data lakes with a big lock at the door.\n\nFinland has come up with Data principles to enable more data exchange. They are human centric, thriving (efficiency gains from exchange) and balanced (divide fairly the benefits of the gains). There are six principles: Access, Share, Act, Innovate, Trust, Learn, all this by default. They are available at https://dataprinciples2019.fi .\n\n## Federico Bonelli: wrap up\n\nThe problem of identity is central, not only in policy but in philosophy and the arts. It is a complex problem, but there is a core simplicity. In logic, A=A: an entity coincides with itself. When I pass the border between Finland and Russia, a frontier guard looks at my passport, and validates that I am Federico. Data in the passport matter, but maybe it is the validation that matters most. Now we are discussing about other methods of validation, algorithmic. Loretta said that identity is political; and politics, as defined by Aristotle, is definitely not a science, more like a kind of art.\n\n## Loretta Anania's suggestions for wrap up\n\n1. Where is the ecosystem?\n2. Oskar&rsquo;s nightmare scenario: &ldquo;wallet vacuum cleaners&rdquo;.\n3. Ga\u00eblle&rsquo;s two risks and two opportunities.\n4.

It was interesting to hear that Georgia should try to attract not foreign investment, but rather foreign capacity-experts, practitioners in various fields who would be willing to live and work here (food for thought).\n\nWe planned a workshop some time in September for the Futurespotters group and whoever's willing to join on COMMUNICATION for social action - whether joint projects, activities, actions. i.e. how to capitalize social media, outreach, etc. -Will have to follow up at next meeting to assign who's doing what on this :)\n\nWe also discussed my idea of UNDP bringing together various actors in Georgia in the form of a hub, with a neutral space where we could all agree on common action/or supplementing each other's actions, rather than competing. This would also allow for presenting interesting actions initiated at grassroots level which can be presented to others for shared expertise or support.\u00a0\n\nWe also thought it could serve as a place where short-term experts invited by various aid/development agencies could have open lectures/ workshops to meet local partners;\u00a0\n\nI spoke about consultations that took place between Jumpstart, UNDP and 112 emergency services on extending the services to people with disabilities. Depending on the availability of funding, we could organize a design thinking workshop to map a pilot procedure through which this can be accomplished. Timeline - some time in October.\u00a0\n\nI also spoke on <a href=\"http://europeandcis.undp.org/blog/2014/01/27/micronarratives-in-georgia-how-to-collect-feedback-from-citizen-experts/\">Micro-Narratives</a> project UNDP is conducting in Georgia.

Most of you were new to Edgeryders or engaged for the first time with the organisation. Congratulations for making it all the way here :-)\n\nHere's what I learned and some ways we can improve, roughly speaking. All lessons and points of failure are a two way street, so don\u2019t take anything personal. I write this with all sincerity and willingness to learn.\n\nIn 2019 I worked with you in Wellbeing in Europe/Poprebel, The Reef, Deep Dive projects, for contracts between 1 month and 1 year, or as external collaborators (not formal Edgeryders contracts). Most of you are here and completing the work nowadays: @TamaraVuk @BaobabUrbain @natalia_skoczylas @jasen_lakic @manuelpueyo @thomas_goorden @ilaria @ralu, and others.         \n\nI spent circa 40-50% of my time in recruiting and training community managers, coordinating local connectors, outreach leaders and other services, and a little bit of mentoring. But I am neither a human resource professional, nor a manager, so thank you for being understanding throughout our collaboration, for flagging issues and helping improve how we work in Edgeryders. Trust that all is being processed in my head and finds a way to the Edgeryders board for future planning.\n\nI see some patterns and points of failure and I will generalize a bit. I believe overcoming these will help us go a long way.\n\n* **A tendency to not read contracts carefully** and work as if the targets and timeline can wait. This is solved by simply making sure you understand the work you are taking on, and budget some buffer space for learning the \u2018edgeryders\u2019 online collaboration tools. Delivery methods might not be fully specified, because they need a team to agree, which is what might create some uncertainty - but a good starting point remains to make sure you understand what\u2019s written in your contract.\n* People **underestimate the work or the time and attention it needs** - if there is an underestimation on the Edgeryders side, I would very much like that to be pointed out at the contract negotiation side. If completing the work is more challenging or takes longer for the collaborator, this is not a responsibility I can take. If flagged ahead of time after the initial strategies have been tried and failed, I\u2019m confident that together we can mitigate it.\n* The risk of **dropping the ball, also known as flakiness.** One of the reasons Edgeryders exists in the first place is because it provides a space of freedom to choose your work and be autonomous in the delivery. We all struggle to move in freedom, it can be empowering but also paralyzing.\nYou being responsive and reachable is crucial for the way I do my work (I don\u2019t know about other Edgeryders people doing management). A good window for response is 24-48hrs. Three or four days without notice is too much. Know that whenever you don\u2019t respond, there is an added cost for other people whose work depends on yours.\n* When you are responsible for something, it works best when ***you* take initiative to stay on top, detect problems along the way and come up with solutions to solve them**. Having me as a manager doesn\u2019t mean that I will knock at your door to point out the problems, it is your responsibility to see them. This also means you protect your delivery space because you are both accountable and take credit for the results. It also goes to say that you are an autonomous worker, not a subordinate, even though I am accountable for your work and I was probably defining the terms of your work.\n* **Stay structured in your communication and delivery plan**. Edgeryders exists because there are enough of us ready to make the effort to read, write and collaborate using online formats. It\u2019s not easy for everyone. Pinging chaotically here and there does not work for me (again, not sure about other Edgeryders managers). We are all navigating massive amounts of text on edgeryders.eu already!\nBest test I found is: you need to be able to point to a document that explains the overall process of your work, or justification for your choices, and hopefully that is one place, not ten; it is a written record (can be a platform thread or a strategy document etc; it can be revisited and other people can make sense of your work. The reports/ blogs I asked most of you to provide when you invoice are also a testimony and summary of how you work(ed).\n*** Having mental clarity and structure in what your put out there when you work with others is a prerequisite if you wish to grow professionally towards leadership & coordination roles, bigger responsibility and higher salaries, all in all a level of seniority within Edgeryders, but also in any workplace!\n* **Personal dynamics can make or break a collaboration.** Yes, there was conflict. Sometimes there is no way to talk things through and deliver in an optimal way, not when we work against short timelines, inherent complexity (like in Edgeryders) or when we, as humans, take it personally. Best I can personally do in that case is to keep it professional, put feelings aside, finish the collaboration by giving and picking up some slack in the process, and finally assess later if to work together again. This is just a personal preference, though sometimes it's probably better to fire/ quit altogether. \n\nWhat worked or would work really well for me with some of you are in fact, I realise now, old age recipes for good collaboration (duh!):\n\n* **Channels for day-to-day team communication:** Riot is the edgeryders open source alternative to Slack and makes it easier to stay in touch. If your contract is 3 months or longer, it is totally worth onboarding you there. Private group messaging on edgeryders.eu - we used it with Tamara and Jasen, and community managers in Poprebel, and it worked as a charm, almost like real time chat.\n* **Check-ins in a regular meeting time and room** (on Zoom), and showing up i.e. with community managers in Poprebel. Even when nothing much was happening during spring/summer, I felt it helped us build a team in the process. Special kudos to @Jirka_Kocian and @Richard who were not even Edgeryders formal contractors and made it there!\n* **Designing the process and plan together**: with Isabelle we build the whole Reef community building strategy from the beginning, together, and we managed to stick to it.\n* **Seeing each other face to face, using the Edgeryders office.** It worked great with Manuel, Jasen, Ilaria and others who were around Brussels or could spend some time visiting.\n* Telling me **\u2018this is not going to work, we need to change strategy, here\u2019s how**\u2019. This I hear seldom and I would like to hear more, it would help me learn and maybe it would empower you to try new things :-)\n\nI appreciate that some of you shared your experience: Ilaria [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/being-in-brussels-for-a-month-to-become-an-edgeryder/10500), Tamara [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/my-experience-with-edgeryders/11954/), Jasen [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/my-wellbeing-in-serbia-experience-so-far/12069/).\n\nFinally, I wanted to thank all of you you every day for the work you did and your effort in critical moments, but I\u2019m afraid I have had no time. So a big big thank you, I\u2019ve learned so much from each of you!! Any other ideas, or feedback you have for me personally, please post it below. I don\u2019t mind having it in a public space and will not take offense!\n\nI wish you happy end of 2019 and much love, I am humbled <3\n\nP.S.

No matter the gender, nationality, age or whatever it is - we're all different and that is it what makes us special.\nWhat I am wondering is: how do we get to know the community good enough considering the 8 hours of work? I know that getting to know people is a quite long process, specifically online. And as I understand it you'd like the community managers to know the guys we're talking to (which is totally fine with me of course). I just can't imagine the dimensions of the project right now (maybe because of my lack of experience I must admit).\nSo my experience with community is more a reallife expierence, like organising learning groups or other student-centred stuff (e.g. discussions in the lectures). This is why I like how you'd like us to greet every new member of the community - as I get it this would be the German speaking?\nIn almost every smaller lecture of my studies we do like a small introduction round so we get to know eachother a little better.\n\nHope all of you will have a pleasant weekend!", "created_at": "2020-01-31 15:06:59.778879", "updated_at": "2020-01-31 15:06:59.778879", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 356, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 78.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [68868], "is_liked_by": [8, 6150, 2915, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76794, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13466, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Did you get any reaction?", "created_at": "2020-05-18 14:52:30.304645", "updated_at": "2020-05-18 14:52:30.304645", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [76156], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66780, "user_id": 4892, "topic_id": 11974, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Dev for the other call first, but sth that links p2p tools with machine translation should not be too far off.", "created_at": "2019-12-03 12:18:31.179753", "updated_at": "2019-12-03 12:18:31.179753", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 11.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [66764], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66299, "user_id": 5983, "topic_id": 11999, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Please mention the name / topic of the event you want to participate in, and the city or town where it is happening.**\n\nWorkshop on Service design in a climate emergency - What do digital services in a world of net-zero look like ?\n\n**Work, hobbies, family life, leisure, pleasure...

web and app development and want to expresse our creativity through solving various world problems using the technologies we mastered\n\n **The problem** : \nNaturally caused disaster are more of a problem then they have ever been , and we have ourselves to thank for such a feat , in 2019 alone More than 950 climate-related  disasters  in 102 countries and territories forced seven million people most of them in Asia and Africa to flee their homes , in most cases governments are unable or unwilling to waste money and resources into either fixing the homes damaged or finding new ones , and even if they do , the process will take a lot of time during which most of the victims will be homeless    \n \n\n**Targeted SDGs** : \nGOAL 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities\nGOAL 13: Climate Action\n\nThe solution we came up with consists of a platform inspired by edgeryders that brings people together from all around the world to help each other in any way possible , we distinguish two types of users in our platform , first are the Non Profitable Organizations (NGOs) , once registered in our platforme , the organization's reach will transcend national borders and will be able to offer their help on a global scale , they can also communicate with other NGOs in order to colaborate and join forces , these organizations will also be our physical representation in the country it resides in , we plan on collecting kickstarter funds to buy abondoned buildings for the sake of renovating them into habitable places where the disaster victims can resort to in the event of a catastrophy , these buildings will be managed by the NGO we partnered with in the country in question and will be used as homeless shelters when unneeded . \n\nother than offering homes for those who need it , the shelters will also serve as a way for homeless people to grow as citizens and gives them a chance to sustain themselves by integrating workshops where volunteer trainers can teach and share their proffesionnel knowledge , whatever is created in those workshop will be put in \"mystery boxes\" for later use .\n\nthe second type of users in the platforme would be a normal user , this person has 3 possible actions , donating money , donating carepackages or engaging in a monthly subscription rewarding them with mystery box created in the shelter workshops. \n\n**Product design template :**\n* Business Strategy : \nnatural disasters became more frequent this last decade , they leave a trail of destruction and homless people behind them , we aim to help these victims through donations , shelter and a chance to work and sustain themselves.\n* Value Driven Metrics :\n we track the success of our product \n* Customers/Consumers :\nThe project will be primarly funded through kickstarters then will be sustained with the mystery box monthly subscription users pay for, this will affect the victims of natural disasters and homeless people from all around the world .\n* Customer value : \nAll our customers will be people willing to help other in time of need which we will provide \n* Consumer value : \nthe consumer will get the help he needs after a disaster\n* Objective : \nour objective is to deliver help for those who need it from all around the world \n* Key results : \nEliminate or at the very least decrease the number of of homeless people especially after a natural disaster.\n* SMART sprint goal 1 : \ndevelope app interface.\ndevelope website interface. \n* SMART sprint goal 2 : \nget the funds(kickstarters) and the partnerships(NGOs) we need to create shelters from all around the world.\n* SMART sprint goal 3 : \ncreate workshops in these shelters and getting the volunteer trainers to run them .\n* Possible solution options : \nthe platform could be a place where normal users could communicate and interact and share their thought and actions.\n* Hypotheses : \nour primary funding source will be kickstarters donation , even tho people always give tons of money for ridiculously useless project and even more money for righteous ones ,there is still a slim possibility that the kickstarter funds will not reach the needed budget to realize what need to be done .\n\n* plan of action :

they're looking at Europe for Citizens funding, not huge amounts, but it might be mature for Creative Europe by winter. I see a lot of space for this on our platform as well - let me know what you think, meanwhile I'm discussing it with the person from came up with the idea and wants us to join. \n\nHere is the description:\n\n*Museum of Corruption (MoC) is an interdisciplinary platform for researching, contextualizing and displaying a virtual collection of corruption mechanisms. Apart from generating and showing its exhibits online, MoC is also physically present in various geographical, political and cultural contexts.*\n\n*By means of contemporary museology, MoC reframes the notion of corruption from abuse of power to moral inability of individual to put the wellbeing of the community above their own interest. By thematising corruption, the project intends to redefine the concept of the museum as a place where art is collected and exhibited by promoting it into a cultural laboratory of controversial social phenomena.*\n\n*ZMUC aims at fighting corruption by collecting corruption (or acts of corruption). As an initiative it has conducted numerous projects aiming at deconstructing the term of corruption and the mechanisms of its workings, with a goal of creating a data-base of corruptive practices.*\n\n*Following up on the idea of museums as \u201ccemeteries of art\u201d (as held by Malevich, Soviet Avant-Garde, Italian Futurism). i. e. the places where art ceases to exist by being displaced from real-life contexts, the project intends to, by manipulating the notion of corruption, museum and contemporaneity, move corruption from real-life situations into a museum setting \u2013 and burry it there.*", "created_at": "2019-03-15 12:54:19.026838", "updated_at": "2019-04-04 09:37:05.198483", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 292, "wiki": false, "reads": 40, "score": 200.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84898, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9517, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Sorry, had to take it down for a minute.", "created_at": "2020-10-13 16:12:47.460795", "updated_at": "2020-10-13 16:12:47.460795", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 31.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [84897], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86057, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 170, "raw": "As long as Trump and his gangs remain in power, Erdogan will always be favored.

Today @Yosser, Monsieur Belgith (her father) and I had an informal meeting (in French!) at Ourghema for me to lay out the vision and get some advice.\n\nWhat I learned:\n\n* Tunisia is regionalized. All ministries are represented by their local offices, and coordinated by an appointed governor. Additionally, there is a regional assembly, whose chairman is elected. This is an advantage, as we can attempt, through Ourghema, to build a strong working relationship with the M\u00e9denine governorate. M. Belgith says the mood is of openness and goodwill, though security is an important concern for Tunisian authorities. He does not see why local authorities would not look with favor to an effort to establish a model for local development in M\u00e9denine. He himself is the head of the Economy department in the governorate. Once the relationship is established, we can ask for help for things like visas.\n* Yosser herself is strongly in favor of trying this model of partnership. I, however, did not ask her to make a decision, as it is important that she is not pushed into it. This might be a lot of work, and we absolutely _must not_ break the good stuff already happening at Ourghema.\n* Yosser is incorporated as an independent (_personne physique_). This was done to qualify for a young entrepreneur loan (update: it was a loan, not a grant), which she got; but it may be a bit lightweight for some of the stuff we want to do. So, we might want to investigate other alternatives (NGO? Company? Social enterprise?).\n* @dorsaf's biohacking club is kicking off soon (next week?) in the space. Dorsaf herself is in Germany now, not clear if I get to meet her. \n\nWhat I propose to do, is this: after Yosser has made her decision, we make a little ad-hoc team to work on this idea. In practice, I would like the involvement of: \n\n* @nadia and @hugi. Goal: pick up the WB relationship and steer the 2019 contract towards a model of local development. @matthias can also help here in terms of big picture thinking and inspiration.\n* @anique.yael and myself, as the RezNet: weave this opportunity into our 2019 H2020 campaign. \n* @noemi, @alex_levene, @bob, @natalia_skoczylas, as the Culture Team: keep an eye out for opportunities. There might be calls where an African/MENA partner is a plus, or a requirement.   \n* and naturally @zmorda, as the Edgeryders main person in Tunisia. Here the work would look like something similar to what Anique does for research in Europe: go to events, look for opportunities, put us on the map. \n\nWhat does everyone think?", "created_at": "2018-11-18 16:40:49.334127", "updated_at": "2018-11-19 14:09:19.275196", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 435, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 208.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4022, 4747, 3, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70417, "user_id": 4667, "topic_id": 11476, "post_number": 19, "raw": "Status update.

As a result, we're happy to welcome @anu as a new moderator on this platform. Thank you to everyone who applied or referred to their friends!_\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdgeryders LbG, the company operating this community website, is looking to hire somebody from Nepal who can help us manage the content and community on this unwieldy website called [edgeryders.eu](https://edgeryders.eu/) :smiley: (And yes, this call for applications is only open to people currently residing in Nepal.)\n\n\n### Your way of working\n\nWe hope the following is attractive for you (and please tell us if not, we definitely want to be an attractive employer \u2026):\n\n* This is **self-directed remote work**: over the Internet / work-from-home / work-from-anywhere, however you call it. We know this is quite unusual (esp. for Nepal), but you'll like it. Provides lots of freedom, but also needs quite some personal discipline.\n* It's **part-time work**. The exact amount of work hours will be negotiated with you, depending on how much time you have available. You can even job-share if there's a need for it.\n* **Work times are flexible** and can be chosen freely. The only requirements are a certain amount of hours per week and month, and sometimes, to get some work done until a certain date.\n* Pay is **20,000 NPR per month**. That's not set in stone, but negotiable based on the exact number of work hours and your level of experience.\n* Initial **duration is one year**, but we hope it works out well and we can make this a permanent setup. You can quit any time, but please only apply if you envision yourself doing this part-time job for at least one year.\n* You will be **paid as a freelance contractor** after sending an invoice to our company, Edgeryders LbG. According to our knowledge, this is possible up to 3 lakhs NPR per year without having to register a business of your own in Nepal.\n\nWe have been and [worked in Nepal](https://edgeryders.eu/c/future-makers/nepal) before. Back then in 2015, \nwe had @meenabhatta, @anubhutipoudyal and @dipti_sherchan as local team members on our team. Pretty sure you can ask them how Edgeryders is as an employer. But also, they have set a pretty high standard for quality of work \u2026 and you don't want to destroy our image of what \"work made in Nepal\" is like :)\n\n\n### What would be your tasks\n\nWe all work remotely in our team, so we have a structured way to send each other tasks using our online platform and tools, and to have group conference calls when we need it. You'd be part of that internal process, and receive tasks like:\n\n* Website content manager on edgeryders.eu. That would be your **main task**, esp. in the first time. The basic issue to solve is that we have recently switched from the Drupal software to this (much better!) Discourse software to run edgeryders.eu, resulting in (so far) poor content organization on this site. Content re-organization will probably take 150 - 200 hours in total, and include tasks like:\n\n    * tagging content with relevant [tags](/tags)\n    * moving content to better categories, finding better category names and category structure\n    * finding content related to certain topics and collecting it to a category of a current project\n    * finding and fixing broken links (and automating that work with web tools and custom Ruby scripts \u2026 no need to know Ruby or another programming language though, we'll teach you if you're interested in that part)\n    * fixing issues with formatting, spelling and grammar in the content\n    * adding proper attribution for Creative Commons licensed images, and finding web tools to automate that job as much as possible\n  * documenting problems you find with the website software in our [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues)\n\n* Assistant for online community management. The initial time will probably a bit like a helpdesk, for which we will install the [Zammad](https://zammad.org/) ticket management software for you. Whenever you don't know what to answer to an e-mail, you'll refer to one of our core-team people. Later, you can try your hand at actual online community management, writing here on edgeryders.eu to \"orchestrate\" the community towards great ideas and collaboration.\n\n* Assistant for copywriting, social media publishing, web research and administrative office work. This part will, for a good part, depend on your exact skills and interests. Don't fear the administrative work though: we hate that too, and will do everything to automate it away :slight_smile: \n\n* Web-based outreach and publicity work for [PayCoupons](https://pay.coupons/), a little startup company that I am involved in and that tries to provide a better alternative to money for small / struggling businesses.\n\nYou'll mostly collaborate with @matthias (me, for the Discourse tech related tasks) and @noemi (for community management tasks, depending on how that works out).\n\n\n### What to bring\n\n* good knowledge of written English (it's ok to use a spellchecker and other software tools if that helps you to write clear sentences with few mistakes)\n* not being afraid of repetitive and / or challenging computer work (\u2026 it will definitely be all of that at times, but remember you can always take a break :) )\n* interest and skills to work with complex software and find ways to get it to do what you want\n* good habits in documenting your work and knowledge in written form \u2013 that's essential since we're working as a globally distributed team\n* a good Internet connection (you can work from a co-working space like [BAC](https://www.facebook.com/bikalpaartcenter/) when needed)\n* a notebook computer\n\nNo need to feel intimidated by this list. Learning quickly is the most important skill, and we'll be happy to show you everything you need to know for this job.\n\n\n### What you'll learn\n\nThe software you will work with is [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), the best free & open source forum software these days, used by some of the largest online forums. So the skills you learn will be useful for similar work-from-anywhere jobs as Discourse moderator / content manager afterwards, and we'll be happy to teach you as many advanced Discourse admin skills as you want to learn (including some programming on the Ruby console).\n\n\n### How to apply\n\nSimply create an account and introduce yourself in a comment to this post. No need to provide cover letter, resume etc. \u2026 we don't want to waste your time. Simply tell us a bit about you, your relevant experience, link us to content you wrote (blog etc.), or show in creative ways you're the right person for the job. Again, don't waste much time. This is just for an initial expression of interest.\n\nWe'll then contact a few of your for an interview (voice or video call), and select one for a first month to try working together. And then proceed to work together, hopefully. (And even if not, the first month is fully paid, of course.)\n\n\n### Who we ware\n\nEdgeryders LbG is a social enterprise founded in 2013 by @alberto, @nadia, @noemi and me (@matthias). We now also have @johncoate and @patrick_andrews on the core team, and whenever we do a client project we hire people from our online community (nominally ~3800 people, but of course less active ones).\n\nOne of our unusual properties is that our company is, in principle and in practice, open to new members in the core team: after working with us for a time (say, 1-3 years) and getting to know us well, you may discover that you like this environment, and we may want to talk about you joining us as a core team member. This is not a guaranteed option of course, but it's possible. Unlike this current job offer, a core team position is not a regular paid position but _you create your own job_, in the area you like, by getting paid contracts for our company. (With our initial support, of course \u2013 you'll learn from us how to do it.)\n\nWe care about the ideas and innovations for better, sustainable living made \"at the edge of societies\", and use all kinds of tools and data science to find and connect these ideas. We then use this knowledge to provide paid consultancy services to governments, intergovernmental organizations and NGOs. \n\nBasically, look around on this website what we care about \u2013 all the content of all our projects is here, though not always well-sorted or well-presented (which is why we need you \u2026).", "created_at": "2017-08-09 18:25:07.074214", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 14:50:08.616059", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1445, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 502.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57002, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10396, "post_number": 19, "raw": "I think that's fair.

There may be efficiencies of scale, obtained in exchange for a massive lack of control. Network speeds inside Europe (25 - 100 Mbit/s via ADSL and VDSL in most places now) is already sufficient for self-hosting, for taking back full control. Of course that needs a massive investment both into open source software (to make it nice and simple to use) and into skills. For the latter, I'd create an obligatory subject in school, called \"server and data management\". I mean, why not. Controlling and safeguarding ones own data is a skill that will be useful even in 100 years if (!) Europe decides to go that way rather than continue on the current road of letting everyone else but not the citizen take control of citizen data \u2026\n\nTo flesh this out a bit, the type of public and open source IT infrastructure I'd like to see for an efficient and enjoyable data-driven society would include the following. I don't focus on AI technology, as that's just another (and slightly more powerful) type of algorithm, not fundamentally changing what computers can be applied for.\n\n* **Company starter kit.** Basically all the tools we are building or still missing to run a small company like Edgeryders, as an integrated open source toolkit. Including an open source version of FreeAgent, which again must include cashflow projection etc. \u2026\n\n* **Federated messaging and calling.** Instant messaging is a nightmare by now, as we lack any recognized interoperable standard (like HTML, e-mail etc.). So we have a lot of competing systems, and everyone needs up to 10 software packages for instant messaging and phone calls these days. They do the same, more or less, and it's a nightmare to use, worse than the public phone system that is being replaced with these tools. A Europe-wide standard for mandatory interoperability between these systems would be a great start. And of course an open source, security audited reference implementation. Like e-mail servers or Riot / Matrix, this system should run decentralized on multiple servers, and people would then have that server running in their own home typically, as part of their Internet router hardware.\n\n* **OpenStreetMap as the official map.** OpenStreetMap is great because, with map software like [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/), it became quite simple to contribute to a \"wiki map\" of the world. I do that sometimes in combination with cycling trips in the forest. It's not perfect yet: the user experience must become better, and governments should be mandated to contribute all their own geospatial data there.\n\n* **Consent-based advertising.** Currently, advertising is very similar to the worst case of how women experience online dating: lots of attention seeking and often disgusting messages, and other uninvited and unwelcome advances. Instead, just like more modern (OkCupid style) online dating, advertising should be based on audience consent. Practically: I may accept and even welcome a product advertisement message from a company *which I like*, and for that I want to browse through company profiles at times and select those I like. Another case where a Europe-wide digital infrastructure would be a big win for citizens.", "created_at": "2019-12-06 12:56:39.518423", "updated_at": "2019-12-06 12:57:44.831806", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 589, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 45.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [66974], "is_reply_to": [66974], "is_liked_by": [8, 5538], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38837, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7586, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[quote=\"winnieponcelet, post:1, topic:7586\"]\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to realise we are all Edgeryders, we should step up.\u201d\n[/quote]\n\n\nWow, @winnieponcelet, great post. I think many of us, including \"Edgeryders\", found themselves in the same situation. \n\nThere is something that really works for me in this \"community of action\" culture. This: in a diverse group of people with fairly aligned values, but very different practices, we look up, not down. We focus on the smartest, hardest working, most generous. We are awed by their vision and courage. At some level, we know these people do not represent the middle ground of our community, but its very best; and yet we cannot avoid feeling like \"we should step up\". I feel that myself, all the time \u2013 only to be told that there actually are some people that look at _me_ and feel the same way. \n\nI am coming to realise that the group of Edgeryders founders has grown, too, even if we that's not what it felt like. We were so busy just trying to make things work! And now suddenly people are asking us to hold workshops and seminars and masterclasses. They want us to teach them. And we are just barely keeping it together! But it makes some kind of sense, because when I look around I see sloppy thinking, bad work and business ethics, lack of rigour. We are lost, but yes, but a lot of organisations out there are _way_ more lost then we are. \n\nSo yes, I guess we try to keep going. We try to step up.

Nevertheless, as the needs of everyone are basically the same and the advantage of federating for scaling up is obvious, there have been major progresses on this and several talks and cooperation with different projects and collectives are undergoing - IndieHosters, unMonastery, TransforMap, plantei.eu, Framasoft, networks on degrowth, transition and community supported agriculture (from where we also get big inspiration for our funding and development model), to name a few.\n\nMail is for example one of the priorities we have at the moment and 2 people in the collective are working on looking up the different possibilities and preparing for a deployment on the next Hackathon, planned for Witzenhausen on August 24th to 28th - maybe some of you would want to join? Mail is one of those emblematic cases where, due to the hassle involved in setting up and the need for reliability, esp. regarding all the spam-related stuff, it makes all sense to build something together.\n\nA second Hackathon is also being planned for Budapest on October 14th to 18th, probably more focused on getting web services and tools for the communities - the hackathon is taking place motivated by the efforts to build up the technological infrastructure and services for the next international degrowth conference. A collaboration on platforms like Drupal (and their hosting) would make sense here.\n\nFor those who are found of IRC, you can usually find at least some of us hanging on ircs.indymedia.org \\#ecobytes.\n\nThe only way to survive the feet of the giant is to get all us small ants working together: http://degooglisons-internet.org/\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-29 23:18:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:51.989406", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 378, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68109, "user_id": 6097, "topic_id": 12094, "post_number": 3, "raw": "ahoj Hansi,\nMus\u00edm \u0159\u00edct, \u017ee jsem velk\u00fd automobilista a blokov\u00e1n\u00ed dopravn\u00edch tepen mi vad\u00ed:)\nAle jsem rd, \u017ee jsem si tu mohl n\u011bco p\u0159e\u010d\u00edst o va\u0161ich motivac\u00edch.", "created_at": "2020-01-03 10:17:27.530899", "updated_at": "2020-01-03 10:17:27.530899", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51981, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 9618, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Report from the call - Goran is now building a partnership and we will prepare this application for Europe for Citizens, and then also Creative Europe.\n\nI will create a folder in the Culture Squad folder where I will put the application they wrote two years ago for Creative Europe and which lost by 3 points only and based on that we can start developing our own ideas. \n\nFrom the preliminary talk, we were interested in including:\n- a space for stories of corruption on the platform, an online archive/museum\n- research - political, philosophical, sociological, of corruption\n- artworks, displayed online, addressing the problem\n- gamification of the experience \n- pop-up physical iterations of the museum, with localised content, with workshops and community events\n\nThe good news is that Goran knows how to get money - there is state support for cofunding in Serbia, and there are some Balkan grants as well.

'' \nTo su pitanja koja mi makar jednom  nedeljno dobijamo od ljudi koji sanjaju da odu iz Srbije, misle\u0107i da tamo negde mogu da \u017eive bajku... Ali mi ih ubrzo uverimo da se bajka \u017eivi tamo gde si i odakle si, samo ako \u017eeli\u0161 i ako veruje\u0161 u bajke. Ako si pozitivan, vredan, radan, sna\u0107i \u0107e\u0161 se svuda i svuda \u0107e\u0161 dati svoj maksimum, a naravno u svojoj zemlji, svojoj ku\u0107i, najve\u0107u podr\u0161ku mo\u017ee\u0161 dobiti i pokazati se u najboljem svetlu. Na\u0161e iskustvo to i dokazuje. \nBudu\u0107i da sam se \u0161kolovala za turizmologa, nau\u010dila sam mnogo o kulturama i poslovanjima u drugim zemljama, imala prilike da upoznam ljude koji \u017eive i rade u inostranstvu i saznam dosta o njihovom na\u010dinu \u017eivota. Budu\u0107i da poti\u010dem iz preduzetni\u010dke porodice i da sam svoje prve poslovne korake ostavrila ve\u0107 u desetoj godini, oduvek sam ma\u0161tala o tome da imam svoj biznis, da budem svoj gazda i to je bila moja motivacija kroz celo \u0161kolovanje i \u017eivot uop\u0161te.   \nKroz zanimanje svog oca, koji je poljoprivredni inspektor i posao svog brata koji je poljoprivrednik, nau\u010dila sam mnogo o zdravoj hrani i kvalitetnim namirnicama koje se proizvode kod nas u okolini, \u0161to me je navelo da veoma zavolim kuhinju i kreativnost koju ona nosi. A onda sam se ludo zaljubila u kuvara i tako je sve po\u010delo. \nRade\u0107i jedan online posao, iz fotelje, od ku\u0107e, upoznala sam jednog predivnog \u010doveka iz Pan\u010deva koji je trenutno \u017eiveo u \u010cileu, a pre toga je proputovao skoro pa celi svet. I svuda je radio kao kuvar, \u0160ef kuhinje, a oduvek je ma\u0161tao, kao i ja da otvori svoju kuhinju i bude svoj gazda. Pri\u010de su nas spojile i upoznali smo se i li\u010dno. Vratio se u Srbiju jer je shvatio da je ovde re\u0161enje i ostvarenje svih na\u0161ih \u017eelja. Konkurisali smo na dr\u017eavne subvencije i uspeli da o\u017eivimo svoj zajedni\u010dki projekat. \nOsnovali smo na\u0161 Studio Dobre Hrane Ma Cuisine D'or u Novom Sadu, na Grbavici. To je ostvarenje na\u0161ih zajedni\u010dkih snova. Ve\u0107 tri godine mi \u017eivimo, di\u0161emo i radimo u na\u0161em Studiju, razvijamo  ideju o zdravoj, kvalitetnoj, vrhunskoj hrani svima dostupnoj. Moj suprug je \u0161kolovani kuvar francuske kuhinje, radio je u mnogim kuhinjama \u0161irom sveta, u Beogradu, Parizu, na Azurnoj obali- Antibi,  Dubaiju, Kanadi, prekookeanskim brodovima, Gibraltaru, \u010cileu. On svaki dan stvara magiju od sve\u017eih namirnica kod nas u kuhinji, dok sam ja zadu\u017eena za prodaju, ono \u0161to najvi\u0161e volim da radim i za \u0161ta smatram da najbolje radim. Dok mu poma\u017eem u kuhinji, smi\u0161ljam kako \u0107u fotografisati i do\u010darati na\u0161im klijentima \u0161ta im tog dana sprema, jer kod nas je svakoga dana dnevni meni \u2013 iznenadjenje. Mi ne posedujemo magacin i ne skladi\u0161timo namirnice, koncept na\u0161eg poslovanja je sve\u017ea hrana, sve\u017ee namirnice nabavljenje istog dana na pijaci ili od malih proizvodja\u010da od kojih se smi\u0161lja meni i nastaje dnevni obrok za isti dan. Dnevni meni je za poneti, pakovan tako da sadr\u017ei ceo komplet i supu i glavno jelo i salatu i prilog i pecivo i desert.\nNa\u0161i klijenti prepoznaju na\u0161u ideju i ljubav prema kuhinji i kvalitetnoj hrani. To su naj\u010de\u0161\u0107e majke, ali i ljudi koji rade u kancelarijama i \u017eele da se zdravo hrane i da znaju \u0161ta jedu u svojoj pauzi za ru\u010dak, kao i oni koji ve\u017ebaju i vode ra\u010duna o svom telu i zdravlju. Iako mi uz ru\u010dak obavezno dajemo pecivo i kola\u010d, na\u0161 obrok je kompletan i izbalansiran i dozvoljava takvu \u010dast svaki dan. Mi koristimo bra\u0161na od leblebije, kukuruza, spelte, kamuta, diococuma\u2026 tako da su peciva i kola\u010di integralni i nisko kalori\u010dni, uglavnom od sezonskog vo\u0107a. Najponosniji smo na to \u0161to je na\u0161 rad prepoznat od strane na\u0161ih klijenata i dodeljena nam je Velika Zlatna medalja Novosadskog Sajma 2019. za visoki kvalitet na\u0161e pite Tarta od \u0161ljive i \u010dokolade u kori od leblebije i kukuruznog bra\u0161na, koja je bezglutenska.\nNa\u0161e porodice, prijatelji i pre svega na\u0161a deca su nam najve\u0107a motivacija za posao, ali i najve\u0107a podr\u0161ka u poslovanju i zbog toga smo im neizmerno zahvalni. Takodje smo zahvalni za odobrene dr\u017eavne subvencije, pomo\u0107u kojih smo pokrenuli posao, kao i podr\u0161ku na\u0161e banke i odobren kredit koji nam je pomogao u poslovanju i pomogao da podignemo kvalitet proizvodnje.\nSada nam mladi kuvari dolaze na praksu, delimo svoje znanje i iskustvo sa njima, snimamo de\u010dije emisije u kojima edukujemo kako roditelje, tako i decu o zdravim obrocima i zdravom na\u010dinu kuvanja i svakodnevno u\u017eivamo u svom poslu I \u017eivimo svoju bajku, ba\u0161 ovde u Srbiji, gde smo oboje rodjeni I gde smo rodili na\u0161u decu. \n![buci%20i%20deca|409x690](upload://zFzgGBmIR7jCPKRQ10NhUdd7Spb.jpeg)", "created_at": "2019-12-03 12:44:37.318393", "updated_at": "2019-12-03 12:44:37.318393", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 842, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 97.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5673, 3, 3206], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65554, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 11826, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[quote=\"matthias, post:1, topic:11826\"]\nor a small-scale setup like a communal living space, a more appropriate way to innovate green living could be \u201cprocess innovation\u201d for building maintenance.\n[/quote]\n\nI love this one! I had a look at the MAMA page and thought: yep, yep!, yep!!! - someone is starting to think about this right. I think Kurzweil would like this.\n\nThere is a related story that begs to be published more widely on the Roman roots of the [Canal du Midi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_du_Midi#Work_organization_and_social_conditions) in France (which was a kinda big thing, so much so that the early US studied so they could make copies). The point there is that a bunch of housewives in the Pyrenees kept kept advanced civil engineering alive cause they just really liked to have warm water in their place. Those ladies ended up being the smart girls on the block when it came to hydraulics in civil engineering. \nAs materials scientist I can only applaud that maintenance could be approached as a socio-technological question.\n> \n> **On new facade materials (like PV panels)**\n\nI agree generally. What I'd recommend is to use them in secondary functions that allow easy documentation (images at (semi) regular intervalls is easiest). BUT I would also hook up a **few** of them to be fully functional - even if it just powers 5-10 ornamental lights. \nThis will inform your next batch of experiments and how easy or hard it will be to get it right. How many of the first 10 will fail? How did they fail? If you picked 5 that you tried to fix in 5 to 30 minutes - how many of those survived?\nYou want to do many of such experiments in parallel and probably abandon half of them at some point, and in Pareto style focus your resources on the more important ones over time.\nIf you want to step up the testing regime I recommend gravimetric analysis of water content (i.e. get a really good balance, and a tool you can take repeatable material samples with).", "created_at": "2019-11-24 19:17:59.462866", "updated_at": "2019-11-24 19:17:59.462866", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 350, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 42.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [65490], "is_reply_to": [65490], "is_liked_by": [5, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65934, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 11912, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Ping @mrchrisadams\n\nWelcome Rey.

Here are my reflections: \n\n\nI would say that it should be 10 people minimum in the beginning. We had the problem in the beginning that we didn\u2019t have enough people (we were 6) so it was hard to had enough people for communal activities (because people have their jobs/ other obligations etc). With 10-15 people the group is big enough for those activities but not too big (so it gets anonymous again).\n\nThe whole goal of true diversity is nice but not sure if it will really work well/ flawless because people are in different stages of their lives. Its not impossible but i think it needs more adjustments and work (e.g. an 50 or 60+ old person might want to have diner earlier and goes to bed earlier then a 20 years old). But thats just my assumption (i don\u2019t have any experience)! On the other hand, if you make it work, it could be quite fulfilling and inspiring because of all the positive effects. And you would make it out of your bubble and see other perspectives.\n\nFor us a weekly talking circle didn\u2019t work but that doesn\u2019t mean that it is a bad idea. I guess people need to push themselves in the beginning and make it a habit, then it might work well. it was too much of a commitment for our people. Twice a month works well for us.\n\nFacilitator is super important in my opinion! From our experience, people need a small push sometimes to be more social and active. In my opinion the role has to be done by someone who really likes it (outgoing, very social person with a lot of energy who sees it as a fulfilling task). It might also be a good idea to make it \u201eformal\u201c and offer this person a small rent reduction (or something similar). This \u201eformality\" could bring more commitment (its an ongoing task) and make it a clear role within the community. So in my opinion a mix of character/ intrinsic motivation and some small extrinsic factor, just to make a formal, would be best.\n\n\u201eThere needs to be access to the private spaces that doesn\u2019t involve going through the common room(s) (when you don\u2019t want to see people or socialize). \u2018Buffer zones\u2019 - It doesn\u2019t even have to be a space, it could be a vacant corner or something. Ideally the building would be structured on different floors to separate private and common areas.\u201c\nI think this is very important. For us this works well overall but sometimes I wish that the coworking/ common space would be directly connected to the staircase which goes to the private rooms/ apartments. Especially in the cold winter, it sometimes is barrier for people to use the common space spontaneously because they need to briefly go outside to enter from their private rooms to the common space. Therefore a whole (town) house would be my optimal solution where the rooms/ apartments are upstairs and the common spaces downstairs. Still you should be able to access the rooms over the staircase without being \u201eforced\u201c to go through the community spaces in my opinion.\n\n\u201eIndividual spaces have different sizes depending on needs\u201c & budgets. We once asked potential tenants exactly that and they all agreed on it, so it probably makes sense to look further into it.

I've been working on social innovation and entrepreneurship for 10+ years, and have helped build a few communities in the past.\n\nI'm very excited to be here!\n\nYou can learn a bit about my work with communities [in my application](https://edgeryders.eu/t/now-hiring-german-community-manager/12248/23?u=hires). For more context: I founded a silent-disco-meets-climate-protest called Silent Climate Parade in Berlin (German [link](http://www.klimaretter.info/protest/hintergrund/17228-spass-statt-spielverderber21), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqHlKus8LQk)), and I have been part of the German climate movement since [COP-15](https://theecologist.org/2009/dec/19/copenhagen-fails-deliver-deal-tackling-climate-change). I've also been played a part in the growth of the Berlin social entrepreneurship ecosystem since 2009.\n\nI think the climate crisis is the defining issue of our time and generation, and I\u2019m so glad to see projects like the Sci-Fi Economics Lab and Earth OS here in this tribe! I\u2019ll be digging into the platform during the next days to find areas where I can contribute.\n\nIn the meantime, I was wondering if you knew any interesting political / anti-rightwing activist organizations in (East) Germany I should know about? Would love any introductions or connections!\n\n[details=\"I look forward to connecting more with you over the next weeks and months!\"]\n:wave: @hugi, remember briefly meeting last fall at the

Question: how do we want to implement the onboarding funnel? [Matthias] has pointed out before that ER is not suited to hosting third-party websites: we can host stuff like the unMonastery website on our server, but not on our Drupal installation. On the other hand, I think there is a presumption that the conversational space here will be not just a vanilla ER group, but an ER group with some level of customization. So, how do we do this funnel? Is it worth adding the static pages to the group, or should we instead install a Wordpress outside of edgeryders.eu to host the copy\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-06 09:06:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:13.350779", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 340, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67897, "user_id": 4861, "topic_id": 12253, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I hope here is the right place.

The rest of the time was open for anyone to bring up anything at all.  Over time this tapered off because so much had been talked through.\n\nWhen we settled on the land we then had in a sense three areas of interaction: at home, at work, and socializing.  It also should be noted that in our case, we had a strong leader for those first 12 years which makes things pretty different from these egalitarian no-leader situations.  But in truth, most days and nights at work and at home did not directly involve anyone other than whomever we were with.  So it was hierarchical in one sense and not in the other. And in fact, in many of these households and work crews, the WDTWCTS ethos prevailed in large part, which is a big reason why I am as comfortable with it here now as I am..\n\nBut in sum, we were never that structured about how we came to resolution. However, just to complicate things further,  there were large impactful decisions made such as borrowing a lot of money from a bank to finance a bigger farming operation, that I and others had no input on, even though those decisions caused all of us to carry a larger debt load.  This is by way of saying that my experiences don't apply that well when devising new egalitarian schemes for co-living and working.

Mo\u017eda ve\u0107 i ima\u0161 neke od ovih informacija o kojima \u0107u pisati. Fokus je na Srbiji. :slight_smile:\n Recikla\u017ea: po\u0161to ona spada u delatnost privatnog sektora i relativno je nova grana u industriji, u Srbiji je na mnogo niskom nivou. Mo\u017eda najzna\u010dajnija 2 razloga: 1. Potreba za dozvolom za transport otpada koje izdaje Ministarstvo \u010dega god. Poljoprivrede i ekologije? :confused: Ta dozvola se ne dobija lako iako je re\u010d o neopasnom otpadu i \u010desto repromaterijalu raznih proizvodnji. Neki je ne dobiju u op\u0161te, pa je to najve\u0107a prepreka \u0161to npr. mala udru\u017eenja ne mogu ni da po\u010dnu da sakupljaju otpad i legalno prevoze, a da ne pri\u010dam koliki je problem firmama koje imaju \u0161kart a ne uspevaju da dobiju dozvolu. Naravno ima tu jo\u0161 papirologije/birokratije kao i za razne druge preduzetni\u010dke aktivnosti. 2. Netransformisana javna komunalna preduze\u0107a. Nije poenta samo da skupe i bace na deponiju, ve\u0107 umesto na deponiju da kad sakupe otpad, da ga klasifikuju donekle obrade i postanu snabdeva\u010d industrije. To se radi tako \u0161to bi svi gra\u0111ani kod ku\u0107e po\u010deli klasifikaciju. Ko klasfikuje plati malo ko sve smulja na gomili plati ve\u0107u cenu ra\u010duna. I to sam re\u0161io! :smiley:  Na \u017ealost nemamo nigde proizvodnju stakla npr. A staklo je jedan od veoma zahvalnih materijala \u0161to se ti\u010de recikla\u017ee, a zbog hemijske postojanosti koristan materijal. Njega je mnogo bolje reciklirati nego praviti. Isto je i sa \u0161utom koji mo\u017ee da se reciklira u neki nov gra\u0111evinski materijal... Naravno, svaki proizvod ili poluproizvod ima neku specifi\u010dnost i isplativost u ponovnoj proizvodnji, pa sad ne bih razli\u010ditim materijalima.\n\u0160to se ti\u010de prelaska na \u010distije i obnovljive izvore energije, mislim da tu nema puno da se pri\u010da jer je jasno da opet dr\u017eava kroz politike to treba da i finansira i podsti\u010de dobrim pravnim okvirom.\nE sad, moj fah. Re\u0161enje za industrije koja zaga\u0111uje. Pri\u010da o filterima ili postrojenjima za preradu te\u010dnog otpada (organskog ili neorganskog) je po meni bezveze, jer nigde niko na svetu nije nekog naterao da tro\u0161i na stvari koje ne donose profit. Ima i dobrih primera firmi koje ne zaga\u0111uju, naravno. Nema tog zakona, inspekcije ili kazne koji \u0107e biti uspe\u0161ni. Po meni su tu 2 re\u0161enja. Prvo, industrijske zone treba da imaju neku vrstu javno-komunalnog postrojenja koje \u0107e obra\u0111ivati otpadne vode. Sprovedu se cevovodi od svake firme do tog postrojenja i svi pla\u0107aju ne\u0161to tu uslugu. Drugo, mo\u017eda i bolje, da se daju subvencije firmama kako bi od generisanog otpada pravile nov proizvod ili poluproizvod. Npr. industrija hrane bi od svojih nusprodukata mogla u nekim reaktorima ili kako god da pravi kompost. \nOprema za tretman voda je poslednjih godina postala veoma dostupna te postoji sijaset proiz\u0111a\u010da i firmi koje instaliraju postrojenja, te je greota \u010dak i prera\u0111enu \u010distu vodu prosipati nazad u prirodu. Bukvalno ima mogu\u0107nost i da se mineralizuje koliko treba i da se vrati npr. u vodovod za ponovnu upotrebu ili da recirkuli\u0161e u samom postrojenju.\nPosebno dobra stvar kod kanalizacija je \u0161to pri takvom tretmanu voda mo\u017ee da se skuplja i izmet i dobija metan. \nZaklju\u010dak tj. \u0161ta da se radi?\nSva zelena udru\u017eenja moraju da se uklju\u010de u lokalne politike ali na dr\u017eavnom nivou i bukvalno da tra\u017ee da se novac usmerava na ekolo\u0161ke projekte i transformaciju komunalnih preduze\u0107a i ukidaju monopolisti\u010dki i \u0161tetni zakoni. \u0160irenje svesti i poneka akcija skup\u0161ljanja ba\u010dene plastike nemaju nikakvog efekta. Zna\u010di, ne samo edukacija dece ve\u0107 edukacija i promovisanje politika odraslima i donosiocima odluka. Mislim da su na taj na\u010din i nastale zelene stranke jer je tema mnogo bitna a tra\u017ei velike ljudske i materijalne resurse, a onda se godinama \u010dekaju rezultati. Svestan sam da je to te\u0161ko i da nam je okvir za politi\u010dko delovanje blago re\u010deno u kurcu, s opro\u0161tenjem. :slight_smile: .. ali nema planete B. :) \nSlodno me cimajte ako mislite da mogu da pomgnem vezano za tehnologiju ili obrazovanje.\nPozdrav iz Srema ;)", "created_at": "2019-12-03 13:25:33.102426", "updated_at": "2019-12-03 13:25:33.102426", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 680, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 47.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3206, 6052], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84891, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9517, "post_number": 15, "raw": "New dashboards are now available at https://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/ngi and https://graphryder.edgeryders.eu/poprebel\n\nPing @matthias, @alberto, @amelia, @marina\n\nI will be migrating the OpenCare and OpenVillage data next.

With some caveats: importers are usually exploitative wholesalers and one of the reason why some countries don't get paid a fair livable price for their products, esp. for agricultural ones. So you need some hacks. From our experience with [\"fair and direct\" coffee sales from Nepal to Europe](/t/6056), here are some general recommendations:\n\n1. Try to find a product that you can _market from within Egypt_, because without European wages for marketing, much more of the final sales price will arrive in Egypt. Even more when marketing to final customers, not to intermediate traders who will only sell it again with their 30-50% margin added. For this type of marketing, you want to market to small and medium businesses, because they will be ok with communication in English, and because they are a target group that you can easily find out about online. A good example is marketing coffee to caf\u00e9s \u2013 in our case together with a unique story that they can tell their customers.\n\n2. Your advantage with this direct sales strategy is that, by cutting out a lot of middlemen, you can have really competitive prices and still get a better profit for yourself. That will help to offset the slightly weird scenario of being approached by an Egyptian company you don't know. Even better to offset that is to partner with a European NGO dedicated to supporting such products, so their name can appear in the marketing communications you create in Egypt.\n\n3. Europe seems a good export market for Egypt, as it's close, has a high price level, and is well connected (container shipping in the Mediterranean and up North). Also, there is a single market inside the European Union, so once the goods passed one of its borders, they can be distributed to any European country without additional customs formalities.\n\n4. For exporting to Europe, at first start with a product that has few customs formalities, and low customs rate. You can find that out in the [TARIC](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/taric_consultation.jsp?Lang=en) database. You don't want to have to deal with phytosanitary certificates (\"food hygiene\"), or with controlled substances. So don't go for meat products or hempseed oil, instead for something like coffee. For these goods, a counterparty on the European side can get the goods through without much hassle (we've done it). \n\n5. The hassle for customs is the same for each type of item, independent of the amount of the item. So 20 tons of coffee is the same form-filling hassle as is 100 kg of coffee. To keep overheads low and manageable for yourselves, go for larger amounts of one product, not for many different products. This way, you can prepare the forms yourselves, not needing costly \"professional\" help except the first time, where it is advisable to get a \"template\" for the following trades.\n\nOnly half of the above is tested, the other half is what we're doing next based on previous experience (read, failures).

Our conclusions were:\n\n1. When putting money into real estate, we all are accustomed to think in terms of freehold property. We buy something, and we own it completely. On the other hand, The Reef wants to be quite large, and so it would have to be owned by more than one owner. Collective ownership of real estate is not easy, but the Wooncoop model (discussed in some details here) seems to offer a partial set of solutions. **Action point**: investigate the model further with Wooncoop. Try to establish if The Reef could give rise to what Wooncoop calls \"a group\": a collectivity of actors that have a common real estate project, and wish to realize it within a cooperative framework.\n2. Right now, people have no way to signal commitment \u2013 or even serious interest \u2013 in The Reef as a project. Everything is open, people come to our workshops etc., but for now Edgeryders is the only entity that has project ownership. But this won't do, because Edgeryders is only one of the future housemates. I am another one, @noemi is another one, and others. **Action point**: create a Belgian ASBL (a no-profit association) that will be gather people who are seriously considering moving into the future Reef, for a more sociable, greener urban life. Patrick will draft a statute. Edgeryders will be one of the founding members, and I will be another.  If you, too, want to be a founding member, let me know, by leaving a comment here. You have time until Friday 13th December 2019. After that deadline, you will be able to join the association at any time, so no need to rush it, though of course we would be glad to see so much enthusiasm already.\n\nEdgeryders will continue to run the relationship with Climate-KIC, and seek funding for the next stage of the project. The main advantage of having an association is that anyone can join it... anyone seriously interested in moving forward, that is.

I wrote an email to similar initiative by some Romanian academics but never received a reply from them. I am not so sure that both are not the same thing. I wish to believe that it led to demonstrations against laws that allow high level corruption few years ago in Bucharest. I didn`t know if the Romanian project was affiliated to a party politics, I thought it was some kind of original web site designers effort to visualize human wickedness.   \n\nI was very pleased to see that an artist I met briefly in South Africa long time ago, Anton Kannemeyer made a comic book like - alphabet of corruption.\n\nThere is also a Chinese artist and filmmaker Zhang Bingjian https://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/npr/155773618/a-portrait-of-chinese-corruption-in-rosy-pink who did an interesting art project, also few years ago.\n\nIn comparison to these projects, our Museum of Corruption http://www.muzejkorupcije.org/  tends to be more ambitious, to be interdisciplinary and to have a greater outreach. Then again, we were faced with so many obstacles even during the initial phase that we realized we have to start small. At the moment, we are doing a research for one case to be exhibited this year.

As a guideline we are looking for people with a strong interest in collaboration, who are comfortable with expressing their ideas through writing, who have an interesting creative output, who are comfortable with the \u201cyes, and\u201d principle and, most importantly, people who love experiments. Writers, poets, playwrights, actors, artists, philosophers, journalists, LARPers, etc. You do not need to be a published author to apply, we accept all applications.\n\nSelected applicants are expected to produce roughly 2000 words per week during each iteration. There are three iterations, each six weeks long with a month break after each one. In total the project will last for up to 6 months.

Ook te volgen via LIVESTREAM**\n\n### \u27a4 Wanneer science fiction en economie elkaar ontmoeten.\n1% tekort minder hier, 1% groei daar. Onze hedendaagse economie is gereduceerd tot een triest en onge\u00efnspireerd getallenspel. Het huidige economische denken heeft de radicaliteit van Marx en Keynes en de brutaliteit van de Fourier, Owens en Olivetti verloren. Het leidt ons eerder naar de afgang dan naar echte groei.\n\nGelukkig zijn er nog steeds intellectuelen aan alle kanten die de status-quo afwijzen en zich een meer wenselijke toekomst kunnen voorstellen. Het is op het gebied van science fiction dat we vandaag de dag de nieuwste, meest radicale en transformatieve idee\u00ebn vinden. SF maakt het mogelijk om ons te bevrijden van de beperkingen, van de gewoontes, om de toekomst te projecteren, verre van fantasievolle clich\u00e9s. Nieuwe werelden en \"fictieve economie\u00ebn\" ontstaan onder de pen van de beste vertegenwoordigers. Vaak dragen ze de kiem van een rechtvaardigere en humanere samenleving in zich.\n\nHet Sci-Fi Economics Lab organiseert de bijeenkomst van de twee werelden rond een uitzonderlijke programmadag.\n\n### \u27a4 Een dag gewijd aan de toekomst met wereldberoemde sprekers.\nHet Sci-Fi Economics Lab, dat op 11 november 2019 in Brussel wordt georganiseerd, is verdeeld in 3 delen die voor iedereen toegankelijk zijn.\n\n**Deze innovatieve workshop**, georganiseerd in samenwerking **met Extinction Rebellion**, heeft tot doel onze energie te mobiliseren om een rechtvaardigere, groenere en meer humane economie te cre\u00ebren.\n\n**Het debat** (18u - 20u in LesRichesClaires) Cory Doctorow, een welbekende science fiction auteur, zal een in debat gaan met een gerenommeerde econoom (binnenkort aangekondigd) over de levensvatbaarheid van \"fictieve economie\u00ebn\". De conferentie zal ook te volgen zijn via livestream.\n\n**De party!** (21u30 - 01h in La Tricoterie) Met een open podium/jamsessie brengen we deze avond tot een einde. Breng talent en instrumenten mee!\n\nVoor degenen die willen bijdragen aan het laatste deel van het evenement, organiseren we een **brainstormsessie op de volgende dag in de Solvay Brussels School of Economics & Management** (14u30 - 16u30). Doel? Het ontwikkelen voor thema's voor artikelen die we in 2020 gepubliceerd willen hebben.\n\n### \u27a4 Een wereldwijde beweging\nHet Sci-Fi Economics Lab maakt deel uit van een globale beweging  die het postkapitalistische tijdperk reflecteerd. Het wordt georganiseerd door Edgeryders, een wereldwijde gemeenschap die zich inzet voor een meer humane, rechtvaardigere en groenere wereld. Het wordt ondersteund door EIT Climate-KIC, het grootste Europese initiatief op het gebied van klimaatinnovatie. Als zodanig biedt het een zeldzame kans om de politieke agenda op EU-niveau te be\u00efnvloeden.\n\n**Grijp deze unieke kans aan om onze economie te veranderen: help ons met onze crowdfunding campagne.** Je krijgt tickets en goodies voor het evenement in Brussel: http://bit.ly/ScifiEconLab 1\n\nZie je op 11 november!\n\n<hr>\n\n## Wat als de toekomst van de economie wordt uitgevonden via science fiction?\n**Om die te ontdekken, neem deel aan het eerste Sci-Fi Economics Lab, dat op 11 november 2019 in Brussel zal plaatsvinden!**\n\nHet is duidelijk. De passiviteit van een economie op basis van haar zekerheden zorgt voor een wereldwijde impasse. Permanente micro-aanpassingen zijn niet langer voldoende. Gelukkig verwerpen intellectuelen van alle kanten de status-quo en stellen ze zich een meer wenselijke toekomst voor. Onder hen stellen sciencefiction-auteurs nu radicaal nieuwe modellen voor en schudden ze de gevestigde orde door elkaar.\n\nOm de synergie\u00ebn tussen de SF en de economie te benadrukken, organiseert de Edgeryder-gemeenschap, gesteund door EIT Climate-KIC, een belangrijke dag van debatten, workshops en festiviteiten die voor iedereen toegankelijk zijn.\n\n**Neem deel aan een grote workshop.** (14u30 - 16u30 in Kano) Extinction Rebellion bundelt zijn krachten met het Sci-Fi Economics Lab om positieve vooruitgang te bespreken en te cre\u00ebren.\n\n**Bespreek met cijfers van SF en de economie.** (18u - 20u op LesRichesClaires) Science fiction auteur Cory Doctorow zal reageren op een gerenommeerde econoom in een groot debat.\n\n**Zet je talenten in voor de festiviteiten.** (21u30 - 01h in La Tricoterie) Breng je talent en instrumenten mee op deze avond om je te verlossen van de stress door concentratie!\n\n**Vind bij ons de toekomst uit - reserveer nu:** http://bit.ly/ScifiEconLab\n\n<hr>\n\n<hr>\n\n# About Edgeryders: Boilerplate text\n\n* Created in 2012.

Izme\u0111u titlovanja i sinhronizovanja sadr\u017eaja podr\u0111avam prvu opciju iz dva razloga: 1) mnogo se lak\u0161e u\u010di neki strani jezik (ne mora biti engleski, \u0161ta vi\u0161e posebno je korisno kod u\u010denja drugih jezika gde se time slu\u0161a pravilan izgovor); 2) vi\u0161e estetski problem - upotreba jezika druga\u010dijeg od originala u tonskom zapisu ume da izgleda i zvu\u010di lo\u0161e ako je produkcija slaba i mo\u017ee uticati na do\u017eivljaj samog video materijala. U Srbiji je tako\u0111e uobi\u010dajna praksa titlovanja i nisam ranije primetio toliku \"deformaciju\" u jeziku koliko je to postalo izra\u017eeno u protekloj deceniji.\n\n\u0160to se univerzalnog jezika i njegove korelacije sa mirom u svetu ti\u010de, bez namere da nekoga uvredim kako kao osobu tako i kao ideju, mislim da je to samo fraza koju koriste i devojke na izboru za \"Mis sveta\" (\"cilj mi je mir u svetu\"). Jedan jezik ne bi promenio ljudsku svest. Tome u prilog \u010dinjenica da je sve vi\u0161e ljudi upoznato i koristi engleski jezik ali mir nije ni\u0161ta dominantiji nego \u0161to je to bio ranije.\n\nLi\u010dno, radio sam kao novinar i urednik u \u0161tampanim i elektronskim medijima (mada nisam ba\u0161 toliko star :thinking:), na copywriting-u, pisao knjige, u\u010destvovao na razli\u010ditim konferencijama, a danas sam posve\u0107en u\u010denju drugih jezika i radu na Google Prevodicu. \n\nNa kraju, nekoliko re\u010di i o ovom i drugim Google proizvodima koji koriste ve\u0161ta\u010dku inteligenciju i prilago\u0111avanje lokalnim tr\u017ei\u0161tima. U poslednjih par godina evidentno je pobolj\u0161anje ove platforme u jasnijem prilago\u0111avanju i smislenom kontekstualnom prevo\u0111enju, tako da je prevod Va\u0161e objave sasvim prihvatljiv. Ipak, ne znam koliko ste upu\u0107eni u sistem popunjavanja same baze rapolo\u017eivih re\u010di. Naime, ovde tako\u0111e mo\u017ee do izra\u017eaja li\u010dni vokabular (dakle upravo taj sporni detalj) pojedinca: samu platformu mo\u017eemo zamisliti kao prazno platno gde na jednoj strani imamo re\u010di ili delove re\u010denica koje su korisnicima ponu\u0111ene za prevod na maternji ili drugi jezik koji poznaju. Nakon \u0161to u\u010desnik unese svoju definiciju prevoda, sistem proverava da li se takav prevod poklapa sa prevodima drugih korisnika i ozna\u010dava je ta\u010dnim. Tako\u0111e, re\u010di se stavljaju na raspolaganje drugim krosicnima da ih provere i ozna\u010de kao pouzdane.

Avancez et suivez toujours la rue principale (qui est la seule goudronn\u00e9e, et qui m\u00e8ne parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 la plage pour la plupart). Il n'y a presque pas de b\u00e2timents sur le chemin, et apr\u00e8s environ 3 km (30 minutes \u00e0 pied / 10 minutes \u00e0 v\u00e9lo), la deuxi\u00e8me maison de rue sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit est notre maison. Il a le nom \"Dar Nezza\" \u00e9crit en lettres blanches sur une porte bleue, qui est facilement visible de la route. [Voici votre itin\u00e9raire] (https://goo.gl/maps/YpvBZBQ34op) sur Google Maps.

Comme vous pouvez le voir sur la carte, la maison n'est pas dans un endroit central. C'est dans un endroit calme et isol\u00e9, avec la plage au coin de la rue et le village voisin \u00e0 30 minutes \u00e0 pied. Nous devons donc nous rendre \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki pour interagir avec la communaut\u00e9 locale et aller \u00e0 Essaouira pour trouver ce qui manque \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki.\n\n\n### 1.1. De Sidi Kaouki <a name=\"chap-1-1\"> </a>\n\nLe \"centre\" de Sidi Kaouki est [31.355639, -9.797694](https://goo.gl/maps/CngRn3pFCzB2). Tous les bus et les taxis partag\u00e9s arrivent ici. Ne soyez pas surpris qu'il ne ressemble \u00e0 aucun centre que vous connaissez: smile:\n\n**Options de transport.**\n\n1. **En v\u00e9lo.** Nous avons 3-4 v\u00e9los de travail, donc vous pouvez nous contacter quand vous arrivez \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki et quelqu'un viendra avec un v\u00e9lo suppl\u00e9mentaire et vous chercher. Lorsque vous nous dites \u00e0 temps, nous pouvons \u00e9galement verrouiller une bicyclette dans le \u00abcentre\u00bb de sorte que vous pouvez simplement le prendre et venir \u00e0 la maison. La combinaison de serrure de v\u00e9lo est `1632` (serrure rouge) et` 0008` (serrure noire).\n\n2. **En marchant.** La maison est \u00e0 30 minutes \u00e0 pied du centre de Sidi Kaouki.\n\n3. **En faisant de l'auto-stop.** Nous n'avons pas de voiture, de moto ou similaire \u00e0 la maison pour venir vous chercher, mais les gens du village de Sidi Kaouki sont serviables. Donc, lorsque vous marchez le long de la route pour arriver \u00e0 la maison, vous pourriez \u00eatre en mesure d'arr\u00eater une voiture dans la bonne direction et de prendre un ascenseur. La route a tr\u00e8s peu de trafic cependant. 10 voitures par heure \u00e0 midi ne fait pas exception.\n\n4. **En taxi.** Nous n'avons pas encore essay\u00e9, mais cela peut fonctionner. Il y a des \"grands taxis\" bleu ciel dans le centre de Sidi Kaouki, qui vont habituellement \u00e0 Essaouira. Mais vous pouvez essayer de n\u00e9gocier que cela vous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 la Chambre \u00e0 la place (ils pourraient refuser cependant, car peut-\u00eatre qu'ils ne sont m\u00eame pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 fonctionner comme des \u00abtaxis normaux\u00bb). Nous n'avons aucune id\u00e9e du prix, mais \u00e0 titre indicatif: il s'agissait d'un suppl\u00e9ment de 30 MAD une fois en ajoutant cette route \u00e0 un taxi d'Essaouira.\n\n5. **En microbus.** Pas tr\u00e8s pratique pour l'instant, mais quand m\u00eame: il y a un petit bus qui va quatre fois par jour d'Essaouira \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki, puis en passant par notre maison et en allant au-del\u00e0. Si vous l'attrapez \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki, vous pouvez le faire arr\u00eater juste en face de notre maison. Une bonne option lors du transport de charges. Vous pouvez reconna\u00eetre le bus du panneau \"Sidi Mbarek\" en haut de son pare-brise. Programme:\n\n    * **hh:mm** (premier bus) _[TODO]_\n    * **hh:mm** _[TODO]_\n    * **hh:mm** _[TODO]_\n    * **15:50** (dernier bus)\n\n\n### 1.2. D'Essaouira <a name=\"chap-1-2\"> </a>\n\n:warning: **Veuillez noter** qu'il n'y a pas de transport de nuit entre Essaouira et Sidi Kaouki. Les options ci-dessous cessent de fonctionner le soir!\n\nEssaouira est \u00e0 25 km de la maison et \u00e0 22 km du centre de Sidi Kaouki. Il y a plusieurs options de transport (et pour tous, vous devez [obtenir la monnaie locale](# chap-6-1)).\n\nEssaouira est compact et accessible \u00e0 pied. Si vous arrivez en bus Supratours, vous \u00eates d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 une station de bus qui n'est pas au m\u00eame endroit que les bus pour Sidi Kaouki. La billetterie Supratours propose des cartes gratuites d'Essa et se trouve \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 des arr\u00eats de bus et de Grand Taxi.\n\n1. **En bus.** Il y a un bus qui va six ou sept fois par jour \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki. Il faut 30-40 minutes pour [sa route de 25 km via Gazhoua](https://goo.gl/maps/rZqpGJHTj272). Le billet co\u00fbte 7 MAD (environ 0,70 EUR). Vous payez en monnaie locale en esp\u00e8ces au conducteur dans le bus. Le bus devrait avoir \"Sidi Kaouki\" et le num\u00e9ro de ligne \"2\" \u00e9crit sur un panneau derri\u00e8re sa vitrine, en lettres latines et arabes. Le centre de Sidi Kaouki est sa destination finale, alors quand le bus tourne, vous savez que c'est le dernier arr\u00eat et vous devriez sortir. Notez que le bus 15:35 les jours de travail peut \u00eatre si bond\u00e9 que vous ne pouvez pas entrer \u00e0 la gare routi\u00e8re d'Essaouira Sud. Notez \u00e9galement, ces bus peuvent facilement \u00eatre 15-30 minutes en retard.

Ce sont de petits bus (pour environ 8 passagers?) Et ils vont d'Essaouira \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki et au-del\u00e0 quatre fois par jour. Ils passent directement par notre maison, ce qui signifie que vous pouvez le faire arr\u00eater juste devant notre porte pour monter ou descendre. _[TODO: horaire des bus, gare routi\u00e8re \u00e0 Essaouira]_\n\n3. **Par grand taxi.** Il y a un grand service de taxi de la [grande station de taxi de Madina](https://goo.gl/maps/6jdKBn75yyx) au centre de Sidi Kaouki. Habituellement, le taxi sera une vieille voiture Mercedes bleu ciel, et au moins certains ont une \u00e9tiquette de destination \"Sidi Kaouki\" sur leurs portes.\n\n    Le prix est fix\u00e9 par la ville \u00e0 100 MAD pour l'ensemble du taxi jusqu'\u00e0 Sidi Kaouki. Ainsi, le prix par personne sera de 15 MAD (6 passagers dans une voiture 4 passagers, cela arrive ici: gentle_smile :) ou plus, en fonction du nombre d'autres passagers que vous ou le chauffeur de taxi trouverez pour partager le taxi.\n\n\n### 1.3. Depuis l'a\u00e9roport d'Essaouira-Mogador <a name=\"chap-1-3\"> </a>\n\nIl existe plusieurs options de transport (et pour tous, vous devez [obtenir la monnaie locale](#chap-6-1)):\n\n1. **En taxi.** Habituellement, vous prenez un taxi depuis l'a\u00e9roport. C'est de loin l'option la plus confortable et la plus courte, mais si vous devez prendre un taxi entier seul, il sera \u00e9galement cher. Attendez-vous \u00e0 60-80 MAD pour l'ensemble de la voiture, m\u00eame si nous n'avons pas encore test\u00e9 cette option. Toute voiture bleu ciel est un taxi, esp. s'il s'agit d'une vieille Mercedes ou d'une \u00e9tiquette ronde sur sa porte d'entr\u00e9e. Nous ne savons pas encore si ces taxis sont les \"grands taxis\" partag\u00e9s qui ont des routes fixes se terminant dans le [centre de Sidi Kaouki](https://goo.gl/maps/CngRn3pFCzB2) ou s'ils sont des taxis normaux qui vont \u00e0 l'endroit que vous leur dites. S'il s'agit de \u00abgrands taxis\u00bb, vous pouvez toujours essayer de n\u00e9gocier avec le chauffeur pour vous amener directement \u00e0 notre maison; s'attendre \u00e0 payer ca. 30 MAD en plus pour cela, mais les prix varient et d\u00e9pendent aussi de vos comp\u00e9tences de n\u00e9gociation: wink: Et si vous arrivez seulement au centre de Sidi Kaouki, [voir ici](#chap-1-1) pour savoir comment proc\u00e9der l\u00e0 \u00e0 la maison.\n\n2. **En bus via Gazhoua.** Moins cher qu'un taxi - attendez 7-10 MAD, mais nous n'avons pas encore test\u00e9 cette option. Mais cela prend \u00e9galement plus de temps et est plus long: [28 km](https://goo.gl/maps/AifRwNftZHE2) par rapport \u00e0 [18 km](https://goo.gl/maps/oinNArerTt42) de l'a\u00e9roport \u00e0 la maison directement en taxi. De plus, vous arriverez seulement au centre de Sidi Kaouki, et devrez [proc\u00e9der de l\u00e0 \u00e0 la maison](#chap-1-1) pour les 3 derniers km.\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; Mais si vous vous sentez un peu aventureux, voici comment. Prenez le bus public de l'a\u00e9roport \u00e0 Essaouira et sortez \u00e0 la [gare routi\u00e8re de Gazhoua](https://goo.gl/maps/ZHEqj5Zunf92) (vous devrez peut-\u00eatre demander de l'arr\u00eater). Traverser la rue pour se rendre \u00e0 la gare routi\u00e8re dans l'autre sens, et prendre le prochain bus allant de Gazhoua \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki. Au moins deux lignes de bus vont de cette fa\u00e7on, mais vous devrez peut-\u00eatre attendre jusqu'\u00e0 une heure. Jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, nous n'avons que l'heure pour la ligne 2 \"Essaouira - Gazhoua - Sidi Kaouki\", voir \"[Atteindre la maison: d'Essaouira](#chap-1-2)\".\n\n\n### 1.4. Depuis l'a\u00e9roport d'Agadir <a name=\"chap-1-4\"> </a>\n\n**De l'a\u00e9roport d'Agadir \u00e0 Inezgane:**\n\n1. **En taxi.** Il y a des taxis partag\u00e9s \u00e0 7-10 MAD.\n2. **En bus.** Vous pouvez \u00e9galement sortir et attendre le bus. Le seul bus qui va de l\u00e0 est celui \u00e0 Inezgane.\n\n**D'Inezgane \u00e0 Essaouira ou Sidi Kaouki:**\n\n1. **En bus.** Des bus pour Essaouira sont disponibles et co\u00fbtent 50-70 MAD. Voir le [horaire des bus] (https://www.lagare.ma/fr/trajet-inzegane-essaouira_aller_2018-01-11.html). Vous pouvez les r\u00e9server \u00e0 la gare routi\u00e8re ou dans un bureau d'agence de voyages \u00e0 proximit\u00e9. Ces bus passent par Sidi Kaouki en route vers Essaouira, vous pouvez donc demander au chauffeur de vous d\u00e9poser [sur l'autoroute \u00e0 la jonction avec Sidi Kaouki] (https://goo.gl/maps/p4JtA1o9dqo). Alors prenez vos risques avec n'importe quelle voiture entrant ou un bus allant \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki - si vous \u00eates malchanceux, c'est [une promenade de 13,5 km] (https://goo.gl/maps/u3TMrnze8VR2). L'auto-stop sur la route ouverte fonctionne mieux avec les touristes qu'avec les locaux, et votre chance avec une voiture al\u00e9atoire est d'environ 10% (petit \u00e9chantillon de 10, \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer mieux :smile:).\n\n2. **Par grand taxi.** Le service co\u00fbte presque le m\u00eame prix que les bus par personne, mais n'est pas confortable car ils chargeraient 6 passagers et le conducteur dans une voiture de tourisme Mercedes normale. Ils emprunteront la m\u00eame route que les bus, donc, comme d\u00e9crit pour le bus, vous pourrez demander au chauffeur de vous d\u00e9poser \u00e0 la jonction d'autoroute vers Essaouira.\n\n**Du centre d'Agadir \u00e0 Essaouira ou Sidi Kaouki:**\n\n1. **En bus.** Si vous arrivez au centre d'Agadir, il devrait y avoir une station de bus. Les m\u00eames bus allant d'Inezgane vont aussi du centre d'Agadir, donc voyez ci-dessus pour plus de d\u00e9tails.\n\nPour partir d'Essaouira, voir la [section correspondante](#chap-1-1) ci-dessus.\n\n\n### 1.5. Depuis l'a\u00e9roport de Marrakech <a name=\"chap-1-5\"> </a>\n\nSi vous arrivez le soir, le seul moyen de rejoindre le centre-ville depuis l'a\u00e9roport est de prendre un taxi. Les chauffeurs de taxi savent que vous n'avez pas le choix et facturent (comparativement) beaucoup d'argent. Nous avons pay\u00e9 18-20 EUR, mais il y a des rapports de personnes accus\u00e9es jusqu'\u00e0 50 GBP. Cela revient \u00e0 combien vous avez envie de n\u00e9gocier le prix.\n\nUne fois dans le centre, il y a des bus qui vont de Marrakech \u00e0 Essaouira, et ils prennent pr\u00e8s de 3 heures. Il y a deux lignes de bus: Supra et CTM.\n\n**Achat de billets.** Vous pouvez essayer de r\u00e9server des places dans les bus \u00e0 l'avance. Les deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont des sites internet: [CTM] (http://www.ctm.ma/voyager-avec-nous/lignes-nationales) et [Supra] (http://www.supratours.ma/en/Produits-services/ National-transport). Mais ils sont tous les deux des sites Web non fiables avec des probl\u00e8mes de conception. D'autres sites font un meilleur travail de montrer les horaires. En th\u00e9orie, ils acceptent les cartes de cr\u00e9dit \u00e9trang\u00e8res, mais les cartes non-marocaines piquent normalement les paiements en ligne, donc en pratique, vous devrez probablement y aller et esp\u00e9rer le meilleur.\n\n**Horaires**. Les bus CTM partent \u00e0 8h30 et 12h30. Les bus Supra circulent \u00e0 8h00, 9h00, 10h45, 12h30, 15h00, 17h00 et 19h00. Le bus de 9h00 qu'ils appellent \"Comfort Plus\" - il est confortable et a m\u00eame un acc\u00e8s wifi \u00e0 bord. Ils disent que le bus 12:30 est un bus CTM. Ce site britannique a un [horaire de travail] (http://www.marrakechtickets.co.uk/supratours-bus-tickets/marrakech-essaouira-supratours-schedule/), qui est suppos\u00e9 \u00eatre \u00e0 jour.\n\n**Lieu de d\u00e9part.** Les deux lignes de bus sont situ\u00e9es dans des endroits diff\u00e9rents. Supra, un prolongement du service ferroviaire national, est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la gare et le CTM est \u00e0 quelques rues (environ quatre) de la rue Abou Bakr Seddiq. Les prix des marques communautaires pourraient \u00eatre l\u00e9g\u00e8rement inf\u00e9rieurs.\n\n**H\u00f4tels.** Il y a plusieurs h\u00f4tels situ\u00e9s pr\u00e8s de la gare. L'h\u00f4tel Opera Plaza est plus d'argent - 16-25 euros de plus que les autres h\u00f4tels \u00e0 proximit\u00e9, mais ils ont leur propre navette a\u00e9roport et d'excellentes chambres. Il se trouve \u00e0 3-5 minutes \u00e0 pied du terminal Supratours. La gare, juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 (\u00e0 une minute \u00e0 pied de l'Opera Plaza), accueille un petit centre commercial qui comprend un magasin Telecom Maroc. Il ouvre \u00e0 10h00, cependant - trop tard si vous voulez prendre l'un des bus du matin pour Essaouira.\n\n**Quand \u00e0 Essaouira.** Pour partir d'Essaouira, voir la [section correspondante](#chap-1-1) ci-dessus.\n\n\n### 1.6. De l'a\u00e9roport de Casablanca <a name=\"chap-1-6\"> </a>\n\nIl y a plusieurs options de transport:\n\n1. **En bus.** Pas encore d'informations claires, mais vous partez en bus jusqu'\u00e0 Essaouira et vous partez d'Essaouira selon la [section correspondante] (# chap-1-1) ci-dessus. Si vous arrivez en d\u00e9but de soir\u00e9e \u00e0 Essaouira, il vaut mieux y passer la nuit car \u00e0 part le taxi occasionnel, il n'y a pas moyen d'arriver \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki alors. _[FAIRE]_\n\n2. **En avion.** Il y a un vol interne de Casablanca \u00e0 l'a\u00e9roport d'Essaouira Mogador tous les deux jours, et il co\u00fbte \"toujours\" seulement 32 EUR (voir [https://www.google.com/flights? gl = de # flt = CMN.ESU.2018-01-14; c: EUR; e: 1; sd: 1; t: f; tt: o)).

Depuis les a\u00e9roports \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger <a name=\"chap-1-7\"> </a>\n\nVoici une liste des connexions recommand\u00e9es ou test\u00e9es que nous avons trouv\u00e9es jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent:\n\n* **Depuis Rome.** Royal Air Maroc propose un vol \u00e0 destination de Casablanca \u00e0 17h15, d'o\u00f9 un vol de correspondance vous conduira \u00e0 Marrakech. Cela sort \u00e0 ~ 100 EUR. L'arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Marrakech est assez tardive, vous devrez donc passer la nuit en ville et continuer le voyage le lendemain. Test\u00e9 par: @alberto.\n\n* **Depuis Paris-Orly Sud.** Il y a un vol direct vers l'a\u00e9roport Essaouira-Mogador deux fois par semaine t\u00f4t le matin. Cependant les contr\u00f4les de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sont tellement aga\u00e7ants en France ces jours-ci que nous recommandons de ne pas utiliser cette route. Test\u00e9 par: @matthias.\n\n\n## 2. Actions dans la maison <a name=\"chap-2\"> </a>\n\n### 2.1. Connexion \u00e0 Internet <a name=\"chap-2-1\"> </a>\n\nIl y a le wifi dans toute la maison, sur le toit-terrasse et autour de la piscine:\n\n* **nom du wifi:** `DAR NEZHA` \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage,` DAR NEZHA AP1` en bas autour de l'appartement 1\n\n* **mot de passe wifi:** \u00e9crit sur un papier accroch\u00e9 dans la salle de s\u00e9jour principale (pour les mods, \u00e9galement ci-dessous dans le chapitre \"[5. Informations prot\u00e9g\u00e9es](/t/id/7955/2)\").\n\nLe wifi est fourni par une connexion haut d\u00e9bit mobile (r\u00e9seau 3G / 4G), ce qui deviendra co\u00fbteux en cas d'utilisation excessive. Alors soyez un peu (un peu) pr\u00e9venant. Regarder des vid\u00e9os en ligne est tr\u00e8s bien, le logiciel de partage de fichiers qui t\u00e9l\u00e9charge et t\u00e9l\u00e9charge constamment n'est pas, en t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeant fr\u00e9quemment des fichiers \u00e9normes (> 1 Gio chacun) est \u00e9galement plut\u00f4t pas.\n\nEn cas de probl\u00e8me avec la connexion wifi:\n\n* Voyez si vous pouvez vous rapprocher de l'un des trois routeurs wifi, esp. avec moins de murs entre les deux. L'un est dans la salle de s\u00e9jour principale, un dans l'appartement 1, un sur le r\u00e9servoir d'eau sur le toit.\n\n* S'il n'y a pas de connexion Internet, parlez \u00e0 @matthias pour le r\u00e9parer, ou si vous savez ce que vous faites, suivez les instructions dans la section correspondante ci-dessous pour le r\u00e9parer.\n\n\n### 2.2. Utilisation de la cuisine <a name=\"chap-2-2\"> </a>\n\n**Eau.** L'eau du robinet n'est pas potable (teneur en sel trop \u00e9lev\u00e9e, peut-\u00eatre d'autres probl\u00e8mes). Mais il est bon d'utiliser pour la vaisselle et la cuisson (il suffit d'utiliser moins de sel). Pour l'eau potable, utilisez le r\u00e9cipient avec de l'eau potable. Dans la cuisine \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage, il est sur le frigo, et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement il y a plusieurs bidons d'eau rechargeables de 5 litres avec notre r\u00e9serve d'eau potable pour remplir le distributeur.\n\n**R\u00e9chaud GPL.** Nous avons un po\u00eale dans la cuisine \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage. Il utilise du gaz combustible GPL. Par mesure de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, la valve de la bouteille de GPL doit \u00eatre ferm\u00e9e tous les soirs. Pour cela, ouvrez le meuble \u00e0 droite de la cuisini\u00e8re, et tournez le bouton au sommet de la bouteille de GPL jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la soupape soit ferm\u00e9e. (\"Tournez \u00e0 droite\" comme dans \"comme un boulon normal\" et \"dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre en regardant la bouteille depuis le haut\".)\n\n**\u00c9change de bouteilles de GPL.** Une bouteille dure 3 \u00e0 4 semaines d'utilisation quotidienne. Il y a trois bouteilles de rechange compl\u00e8tes dans le petit hangar sous l'escalier principal. Ils appartiennent au jardinier, mais nous pouvons les utiliser comme pi\u00e8ces de rechange si nous les rempla\u00e7ons aussi par des plantes plus tardives. Pour \u00e9changer une bouteille de GPL vide avec une bouteille pleine: Mettez-la un lundi matin au bord de la rue, devant notre porte principale. (Les villageois d'Iskoha sortiront aussi leurs bouteilles de GPL \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 oppos\u00e9.) Un camion-citerne GPL viendra entre 11h00 et 14h00 (observ\u00e9 13h15) apr\u00e8s avoir livr\u00e9 aux magasins de Sidi Kaouki. Ils vont sonner pour obtenir le paiement de la recharge LPG, soit 40 MAD pour une bouteille de la taille que nous avons.\n\n**Faire du caf\u00e9.** Nous avons des cafeti\u00e8res moka en diff\u00e9rentes tailles. Utilisez l'eau avec le moins de sel que vous pouvez trouver. L'eau achet\u00e9e dans un magasin est la meilleure, l'eau du puits pr\u00e8s de l'\u00e9cole est la deuxi\u00e8me meilleure, l'eau du puits pr\u00e8s de la mosqu\u00e9e est d\u00e9j\u00e0 trop sal\u00e9e pour un bon caf\u00e9, et l'eau du robinet est vraiment inutilisable pour le caf\u00e9.\n\n\n### 2.3. \u00c9limination des d\u00e9chets organiques <a name=\"chap-2-3\"> </a>\n\nLes d\u00e9chets organiques et le papier sont compost\u00e9s dans le jardin (nous pouvons donc les collecter dans le m\u00eame bac). Cela fonctionne comme ceci:\n\n1. Trouver un endroit le long du mur, \u00e0 droite apr\u00e8s \u00eatre entr\u00e9 dans la porte principale, qui n'a pas de racines d'arbres ou qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 creus\u00e9 (ce qui signifierait que vous creuseriez du compost plut\u00f4t que dedans).\n2. Creusez un trou assez grand pour votre seau de d\u00e9chets de cuisine, et remplissez-le dans le trou.\n3. Mettez dans un peu d'eau. Soit avec un tuyau dans le coin nord-est (la soupape est proche du mur du jardin), soit avec le seau \u00e0 d\u00e9chets. Nettoyez le bac \u00e0 d\u00e9chets dans le processus.\n4. Mettez le sol creus\u00e9 sur le dessus des d\u00e9chets.\n5. Profitez.\n\nNous voulons probablement cr\u00e9er un trou plus grand et composter la fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re (avec un poteau central pour l'a\u00e9rer en le d\u00e9pla\u00e7ant de temps en temps). Ensuite, quand nous partirons, nous ajouterons de la terre au sommet une seule fois.\n\n\n### 2.4. \u00c9limination des d\u00e9chets r\u00e9siduels <a name=\"chap-2-4\"> </a>\n\nIl n'y a pas de collecte des d\u00e9chets \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki - voir [ici](http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2016/08/24/a_n_11679062.html) pour une partie de l'histoire. Il est donc pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de ne pas produire beaucoup de d\u00e9chets plastiques et m\u00e9talliques.\n\nLa prochaine option d'\u00e9limination appropri\u00e9e est [Ghazoua] (https://goo.gl/maps/gzhFXFWbgLy), sur la route d'Essaouira. Nous n'avons pas encore trouv\u00e9 un moyen acceptable de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer nos d\u00e9chets r\u00e9siduels, ou une alternative acceptable pour les \u00e9liminer autrement. Donc pour l'instant, il semble pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de laver les r\u00e9cipients alimentaires et de stocker les d\u00e9chets \"agr\u00e9ables, secs et propres\" jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'on sache quoi en faire ...\n\n\n### 2.5. Utilisation de la machine \u00e0 laver <a name=\"chap-2-5\"> </a>\n\n1. Branchez le lave-linge dans la fen\u00eatre de la salle de bain avec de l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, en utilisant la rallonge g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement trouv\u00e9e dans la salle de bain.\n\n2. Placez les articles \u00e0 laver dans le seau gauche de la machine. Ne le remplissez pas plus de la moiti\u00e9, car le contenu en rotation risque d'endommager le petit sac filtrant en tissu accroch\u00e9 dans un coin.\n\n3. Assurez-vous que le s\u00e9lecteur de la vanne est r\u00e9gl\u00e9 sur \"Wash / Rinse\" (Nettoyer / Rincer), car toute l'eau que vous avez inject\u00e9e se refait couler si elle est r\u00e9gl\u00e9e sur \"Vidange\".\n\n4. Utilisez le tuyau pour remplir le seau gauche avec de l'eau jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il couvre \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s les v\u00eatements.\n\n5. Mettez \"une quantit\u00e9 normale de poudre \u00e0 laver\", environ une tasse de caf\u00e9 pour une pleine charge - au maximum. Le plus de savon que vous utilisez le plus de travail qu'il faudra pour le rincer.\n\n6. R\u00e9glez le cadran \"Timer\" pour l'action de lavage: 9 pour les v\u00eatements l\u00e9g\u00e8rement sales, 12 pour les v\u00eatements sales, 15 pour les v\u00eatements sales. Cela correspond approximativement aux minutes (\"15\" est 17:45 min). Vous pouvez toujours recommencer si vous pensez qu'il a besoin de plus de temps.\n\n7. Laisser se laver jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la minuterie soit \u00e0 z\u00e9ro.\n\n8. R\u00e9glez le bouton de la vanne sur \"drain\" pour retirer l'eau de lavage.\n\n9. Rincer les articles lav\u00e9s. Soit le faire manuellement en utilisant le tuyau, le seau et le drain \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la machine \u00e0 laver. Ou r\u00e9glez \u00e0 nouveau le bouton de la vanne sur \"Wash / Rinse\" (rin\u00e7age / rin\u00e7age), ajoutez plus d'eau, lavez pendant quelques minutes \u00e0 l'aide du cadran de la minuterie de lavage et vidangez \u00e0 nouveau. Vous devrez rincer deux fois si vous ne le faites pas manuellement. *Pour \u00eatre s\u00fbr que tout le savon est hors de vos v\u00eatements, puis rincez-les manuellement en r\u00e9glant la machine pour drainer et en soulevant chaque pi\u00e8ce rincer avec le tuyau que vous l'avez ramen\u00e9 au seau de rotation sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit de la machine.\n\n10. Mettez les v\u00eatements dans le seau droit de la machine, ajoutez la feuille de plastique souple qui se trouve dans le seau sur le dessus des v\u00eatements, et fermez le couvercle du seau fermement (de sorte que le loquet accroche r\u00e9ellement).\n\n11. R\u00e9glez la molette de la minuterie et laissez-la tourner jusqu'\u00e0 la fin. Vous devrez tenir la machine en place pendant qu'elle tourne - comme toutes les vieilles machines \u00e0 laver, elle \u00abmarchera\u00bb loin du mur et pourrait m\u00eame retirer la prise si elle n'est pas surveill\u00e9e.\n\n12. Accrochez vos v\u00eatements sur les lignes sur le patio arri\u00e8re.\n\n\n### 2.6. Maintenance du pool <a name=\"chap-2-6\"> </a>\n\n#### Nettoyage du sol\n\nCeci est fait en utilisant un robot :D Nettoyez simplement la zone peu profonde et le long des bords avec le long balai trouv\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de la piscine, Connectez le robot \u00e0 l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, et laissez-le nettoyer.\n\nAssurez-vous d'attacher le bo\u00eetier d'alimentation du robot \u00e0 une chaise ou \u00e0 quelque chose de stable afin qu'il ne soit pas aspir\u00e9 dans l'eau.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/37bcc0b41b50bd5441d185664af3dd38896582f7.jpg\" width=\"345\">\n\n#### Maintien de l'apport de chlore \u00e0 action prolong\u00e9e\n\n1. Tous les jours (ou tous les deux jours), d\u00e9visser le couvercle du tube \u00e0 l'un des coins de la partie peu profonde de la piscine.\n\n2. Sortez le filet en plastique et l'insert en plastique.\n\n3. Nettoyez le filet de l'herbe, des algues et des d\u00e9bris.\n\n4. Si n\u00e9cessaire (lorsque les languettes ont perdu plus de 70%, environ tous les 7 \u00e0 10 jours), mettez deux nouvelles languettes de chlore \u00e0 action prolong\u00e9e dans le seau \u00e0 chlore sous les escaliers de la maison. Placez-le au centre du filet en plastique, placez l'insert en plastique sur le dessus, pliez le filet autour et jetez tout dans le tube.\n\n5. Et refermer ce tube.\n\n#### Test de chlore et de pH\n\nLe produit utilis\u00e9 est le [kit d'analyse de chlore et pH AXTON](https://www.leroymerlin.fr/v3/p/produits/p-e53836).\n\n1. V\u00e9rifiez quand la couleur de l'eau change visuellement, ou attendez au plus 10 jours.\n\n2. Rincez les tubes \u00e0 essai, puis remplissez-les avec un \u00e9chantillon d'eau \u00e0 une profondeur de 40 cm et loin de la d\u00e9charge d'eau.\n\n3. R\u00e9glez le niveau d'eau dans les tubes \u00e0 essai sur la marque sur les tubes.\n\n4. Ajouter quatre (4) gouttes de liquide de la bouteille \u00e0 couvercle jaune (solution d'essai de chlore) dans le tube \u00e0 essai jaune et quatre (4) gouttes de liquide de la bouteille \u00e0 couvercle rouge (solution d'essai de pH) dans l'essai rouge tube. Attention, la solution d'essai au chlore contient 3,5% d'acide chlorhydrique, ce qui peut provoquer des br\u00fblures cutan\u00e9es.\n\n5. Mettez les couvercles sur les tubes et agitez pour m\u00e9langer.\n\n6. Comparez avec les \u00e9cailles sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 du tube \u00e0 essai. (Le taux de chlore id\u00e9al est de 1,0 - 1,5 mg / l, ou de 1,5 - 2,0 mg / l selon le r\u00e9cipient de chlore \u00e0 action rapide.Le niveau de pH id\u00e9al est de 7,2 - 7,6 D\u00e9terminer la lecture de chlore rapidement, car la couleur jaune Il est difficile de d\u00e9terminer la valeur correcte entre 1,0 et 3,0 mg / l de chlore, dans ce cas, vous pouvez remplacer la moiti\u00e9 de la solution jaune par l'eau du robinet, agiter, v\u00e9rifier \u00e0 nouveau et multiplier le r\u00e9sultat par deux. difficile de d\u00e9terminer la lecture du pH - ici, la couleur est pertinente, pas la quantit\u00e9 de transparence.Si le liquide est rose, le pH est trop \u00e9lev\u00e9.)\n\n7. Si la valeur du pH est en dehors de sa plage optimale (7,2 - 7,6 pH): ajuster avec la solution de la bo\u00eete de 30 l de la pi\u00e8ce sous l'escalier, comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessous.\n\n8. Si la valeur du chlore est tr\u00e8s basse (par exemple, <0,5 mg / l) et apr\u00e8s avoir ajust\u00e9 le pH et attendre deux heures que l'acide se diffuse: mesurer de nouveau le chlore et ajuster avec du chlore \u00e0 action rapide comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessous.\n\nSource: instructions d'utilisation du kit de test AXTON, accessible en PDF \u00e0 partir de [ici] (https://www.leroymerlin.fr/v3/p/produits/p-e53836) et traduit en anglais. Et quelques valeurs d'exp\u00e9rience / conseils.\n\n#### R\u00e9glage du niveau de pH\n\n1. Si le pH est trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 selon le kit de test, calculez la quantit\u00e9 d'acide \u00e0 ajouter: ajoutez 0,3 l pour diminuer le pH de 7,8 \u00e0 7,3 ou ajoutez 1,25 l pour diminuer le pH de 8,3 \u00e0 7,3.\n\n    (Le premier est selon les instructions sur le dos de la bo\u00eete, qui se lisent: 0,1 l diminuer le pH de 0,5 dans 10 m\u00b2 d'eau (puis en combinant avec le dosage de chlore qui, par exp\u00e9rience, a conduit \u00e0 prendre un volume de 30 m\u00b3 d'eau.) Puisque [pH est une \u00e9chelle logarithmique d\u00e9cadique] (http://chemistry.elmhurst.edu/vchembook/184ph.html), ces instructions ne s'appliquent que pour le pH 0.5 voisin de la valeur optimale, ce que nous supposons ici pH 7,4 (milieu de la plage optimale de 7,2 - 7,6 pH) Donc une solution de 0,3 L diminuera le pH de 0,5 pH (un demi-ordre de grandeur, ce qui signifie un facteur de qrt (10) = 3,16 dans la concentration ionique) Pour le pH de 0,5 suivant, la concentration en ions augmente \u00e0 nouveau d'un facteur de sqrt (10) = 3,16, soit 3,16 fois plus de liquide pour passer de 8,3 \u00e0 7,8. 1,25 l est n\u00e9cessaire pour diminuer le pH de 8,3 \u00e0 7,3.)\n\n2. Mettez un bocal en verre (pour un support stable) sur le bord de la piscine avec une marque de la quantit\u00e9 de liquide que vous voulez mesurer.\n\n3. Portez des gants en caoutchouc rose, des lunettes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (ou des lunettes de soleil) et des v\u00eatements longs pour votre s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n\nVerser l'acide de la bo\u00eete de 30 l avec la solution \"pH moins\" dans le bocal en verre jusqu'\u00e0 la marque. La bo\u00eete se trouve dans la petite pi\u00e8ce sous les escaliers.\n\n5. Versez le pot de verre dans un seau avec 5-10 l d'eau pour le diluer avant de le verser dans la piscine (de sorte que les paillettes soient moins dangereuses).\n\n6. Versez ce seau de liquide dans la piscine.\n\n7. Rincez le pot, le seau et la zone de travail avec l'eau de la piscine pour diluer les p\u00e9pites d'acide.\n\nToucher l'acide est dangereux et peut causer de graves br\u00fblures. Portez un \u00e9quipement de protection appropri\u00e9, et au cas o\u00f9 quelque chose p\u00e9n\u00e8trerait sur votre peau, vos yeux ou vos v\u00eatements, rincez-le imm\u00e9diatement avec beaucoup d'eau pour le diluer. Si vous le diluez suffisamment, il ne peut plus agir et ne provoquera pas de br\u00fblures cutan\u00e9es.\n\n#### R\u00e9glage du niveau de chlore\n\n1. Assurez-vous d'avoir r\u00e9gl\u00e9 le niveau de pH en premier. Le r\u00e9glage du chlore ne fonctionne pas si le pH est trop \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n\n2. Prenez le seau avec de la poudre de chlore \u00e0 action br\u00e8ve dans la pi\u00e8ce situ\u00e9e sous l'escalier.\n\n3. Portez des gants imperm\u00e9ables (ou improvisez avec des sacs en plastique) et des lunettes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (ou improvisez avec des lunettes de soleil), et assurez une bonne ventilation (travail \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur). Prenez soin de vous tenir \u00e9loign\u00e9 du seau et du m\u00e9lange eau / poudre pour ne pas inhaler la poussi\u00e8re ou les vapeurs.\n\n4. Calculez la quantit\u00e9 de poudre dont vous avez besoin: 30 g pour chaque augmentation de concentration de 0,1 mg / l dont vous avez besoin, jusqu'\u00e0 un objectif de 2,0 mg / l. (Ce sont des valeurs d'exp\u00e9rience, confirm\u00e9es \u00e0 plusieurs reprises pour la piscine. Voir ci-dessous pour les recommandations de dosage officielles sur le seau.)\n\n5. Mesurez la poudre avec les graduations \u00abchlore / oxyg\u00e8ne\u00bb du r\u00e9cipient doseur situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du seau \u00e0 chlore.\n\n6. M\u00e9langez la poudre avec de l'eau, en utilisant une cannette coup\u00e9e de 5 l et un long b\u00e2ton en bois, puis versez la dans la piscine.\n\n7. Lavez-vous soigneusement les mains, juste au cas o\u00f9.\n\nLe produit utilis\u00e9 est [Ocedis Chlore Poudre 5 kg](http://bricoland.ma/chlore-en-poudre-5kg-141.html) (sans stabilisateur), voir aussi la gamme compl\u00e8te de produits [Ocedis chlore] (http: //www.ocedis.com/g34-desinfection.html). Les instructions d'utilisation sont les suivantes (\u00e0 partir de l'arri\u00e8re du conteneur, traduit en anglais):\n\n* Utiliser 10 g / 10 m\u00b3 dans le skimmer ou le doseur de chlore tous les 7 \u00e0 10 jours en fonction de la temp\u00e9rature et de la dur\u00e9e de la filtration.\n* 10 g / 10m\u00b3 entra\u00eene une augmentation du chlore de 1,0 mg / l (DPD1).\n* Maintenir le niveau de chlore entre 1,5 et 2,0 mg / l.\n* Les mesures d'eau devraient \u00eatre faites une fois par semaine.\n* Attention: ne jamais mettre en contact direct avec une doublure synth\u00e9tique.\n\n#### Valve controls: R\u00e9glage par d\u00e9faut\n\nLes pompes sont situ\u00e9es dans la petite pi\u00e8ce souterraine avec le couvercle en m\u00e9tal \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la piscine.\n\nLe param\u00e8tre par d\u00e9faut, qui devrait \u00eatre actif lorsque vous ne faites aucune situation particuli\u00e8re, est le suivant. Il est suppos\u00e9 comme r\u00e9glage initial dans toutes les instructions ci-dessous.\n\n* La poign\u00e9e est sur \"Filtre\".\n* Valve no. 1 est ouvert (vertical).\n* Valve no. 2 est ferm\u00e9 (vertical).\n* L'alimentation est activ\u00e9e.\n\n(C'est ce qu'on a dit \u00e0 @hazem et comment nous avons trouv\u00e9 les r\u00e9glages de la pompe dans la pi\u00e8ce, mais pas la description sur la porte de la bo\u00eete de contr\u00f4le, qui dit: \"Situation normale: filtration; 3,2 et 5 ouvert; 4 ferm\u00e9, orange ferm\u00e9, 1 ferm\u00e9 En outre, les instructions de couvercle mentionnent: Toujours soit (\"n \u00b0 1 ouvert, n \u00b0 2 ferm\u00e9\" ou \"n \u00b0 1 ferm\u00e9, n \u00b0 2 ouvert\"), et (\"n \u00b0 5 -6 ouvrir \"ou\" n \u00b0 4 ouvert \") N'utilisez pas le num\u00e9ro 4 (signifie ne l'ouvrez pas) Ne r\u00e9glez pas le niveau d'eau quand il n'y a pas d'invit\u00e9s dans la maison (ne le diminuez pas) .)\n\n#### Valve: Laver les filtres\n\nAfin de vider les filtres:\n\n1. \u00c9teignez l'alimentation.\n2.

Entretien du jardin <a name=\"chap-2-7\"> </a>\n\nLe jardin de l\u00e9gumes / herbes \u00e0 droite apr\u00e8s l'entr\u00e9e de la porte doit \u00eatre arros\u00e9 tous les apr\u00e8s-midi / soir (comme dans \"passer dix fois chaque rang\u00e9e avec le tuyau\"). Un jardinier vient tous les jours (matin ou apr\u00e8s-midi) pour le faire. Bien s\u00fbr, nous pouvons l'aider avec \u00e7a.\n\nEn dehors du jardin de l\u00e9gumes / herbes, les plantes sont \"sans entretien\".

Utilisation de la t\u00e9l\u00e9phonie mobile et de l'Internet mobile <a name=\"chap-2-8\"> </a>\n\nIl y a deux tours de t\u00e9l\u00e9phonie cellulaire \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki, [ici] (https://goo.gl/maps/oTNassdQADR2), \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 du centre. Ils comprennent les antennes Maroc Telecom, probablement aussi les antennes Orange et autres.\n\nLe niveau du signal du r\u00e9seau mobile au sein de la maison varie en fonction de la position, mais dans le salon de premier niveau, il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tr\u00e8s bas pour Orange et bas \u00e0 moyen pour Maroc Telecom. Ceci est caus\u00e9 par les trois murs que le signal doit traverser sur le chemin de la tour cellulaire.\n\nPour Maroc Telecom, voici notre \u00abmeilleure pratique\u00bb:\n\n* **Appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques.** La puissance du r\u00e9seau est suffisante partout dans la maison pour les appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques.

Sur le toit, vous avez une r\u00e9ception parfaite.\n\n* **Internet mobile** La puissance du r\u00e9seau est souvent insuffisante pour l'utilisation de l'Internet mobile (typiquement une connexion de donn\u00e9es EDGE 2.5G lente et peu fiable dans le hall de vie de premier niveau, parfois HSDPA stable avec Maroc Telecom). Si vous voulez un Internet mobile fiable, par exemple pendant les pannes occasionnelles de la connexion Internet principale de la maison, mettez simplement un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable en mode \u00abhotspot\u00bb et placez-le dans une fen\u00eatre au nord (face \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki). Puis connectez-vous \u00e0 cet appareil par wifi depuis votre ordinateur dans le salon ou l'un des appartements. En outre, vous avez la force parfaite du signal r\u00e9seau 4G / LTE sur le toit.\n\n\n### 2.9.

Nous n'avons pas encore vu un fusible qui \u00e9tait ouvert (position basse) quand nous sommes arriv\u00e9s.\n\n\n### 2.10. R\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes d'approvisionnement en eau <a name=\"chap-2-10\"> </a>\n\nSi quelque chose se brise, nous pouvons appeler le \"bricoleur de la maison\". Le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone est dans la section avec les informations prot\u00e9g\u00e9es ci-dessous.\n\n**Installation d'eau.** Chemin de l'eau du puits aux robinets:\n\n1. **Eau bien.** Tout l'eau du robinet dans la maison est aliment\u00e9e par un puits \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la piscine, sous les panneaux solaires. Ce puits a sa propre pompe install\u00e9e, probablement \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du puits. Cependant, ce n'est pas la pompe qui alimente le r\u00e9servoir d'eau sur le toit, selon le bricoleur de la maison. Nous supposons donc que la pompe dans le puits pompe de l'eau vers la citerne devant la salle \"Locale Technique\".\n\n2. **Citerne** L'eau est stock\u00e9e dans une citerne situ\u00e9e sous la salle \"Technique locale\". Les dalles de b\u00e9ton en face de cette pi\u00e8ce sont des orifices d'acc\u00e8s, mais elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ciment\u00e9es r\u00e9cemment par le jardinier.\n\n3. **Pompe \u00e0 eau principale** Il y a une pompe \u00e0 eau mont\u00e9e sur le sol dans la chambre \"Locale Technique\", pompant l'eau de la citerne vers le r\u00e9cipient sous pression rouge \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la porte. Il d\u00e9marre et s'arr\u00eate automatiquement, en fonction de la pression du tuyau dans son c\u00f4t\u00e9 haute pression, \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 la pression de l'eau dans la maison. Le capteur de pression se trouve \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de lui et a \u00e9galement une jauge de pression m\u00e9canique qui montre normalement environ 2,0 bars. Il engage la pompe \u00e0 1,6 bars et arr\u00eate la pompe \u00e0 2,6 bars.\n\n4. **R\u00e9cipient sous pression rouge** L'eau de la pompe, environ 30-50 l \u00e0 chaque fois que la pompe fonctionne, est stock\u00e9e dans un r\u00e9cipient sous pression rouge de 100 l \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la porte Locale Technique. En appuyant sur l'eau, l'air au-dessus est comprim\u00e9, fournissant la pression de l'eau dans la maison. Donc, lorsque vous ouvrez un robinet dans la maison, la pompe ne d\u00e9marre pas imm\u00e9diatement, seulement apr\u00e8s que la pression d'alimentation tombe en dessous de 1,6 bar.\n\n5. **Filtre \u00e0 eau.** Dans la ligne haute pression apr\u00e8s la pompe \u00e0 eau, il y a un dispositif qui ressemble \u00e0 un grand pot en verre. C'est le filtre \u00e0 eau. Il devrait normalement avoir une unit\u00e9 de filtre \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur qui, de temps en temps, doit \u00eatre remplac\u00e9 (ou rinc\u00e9, selon le type). Mieux vaut laisser le bricoleur de la maison faire cela, car nous ne savons pas exactement comment (encore). Cependant, notre meilleure estimation est la suivante: d'abord \u00e9teindre le fusible reliant la pompe sur le plancher de la chambre Locale Technique, et \u00e9galement fermer les vannes d'eau dans le coin allant aux tubes en plastique souple rouge et noir (\u00e0 la maison et \u00e0 la chauffe-eau solaire sur le toit, respectivement). Si vous ne le faites pas, l'eau de la pompe (qui d\u00e9marrera \u00e0 cause de la chute de pression \u00e0 l'ouverture du bo\u00eetier du filtre), puis toute l'eau stock\u00e9e dans le chauffe-eau et les conduites d'eau s'\u00e9coulera dans la pi\u00e8ce. Puis ouvrez le bo\u00eetier du filtre, laissant l'eau s'\u00e9couler (et non sur les c\u00e2bles ...).\n\n5. **Adoucisseur d'eau.** Apr\u00e8s le filtre \u00e0 eau, l'eau passe \u00e0 travers un adoucisseur d'eau / syst\u00e8me de d\u00e9calcification (la grande bo\u00eete en plastique blanche avec un bo\u00eetier de commande de soupape \u00e9lectronique en haut). En fonctionnement normal, l'eau sera simplement pomp\u00e9e \u00e0 travers cette machine et ses ic\u00f4nes de magn\u00e9sium et de calcium seront remplac\u00e9es par du sodium en mouvement. Lorsqu'il est connect\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, il effectuera \u00e9galement ses \u00abcycles de recharge\u00bb pour r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rer sa capacit\u00e9 d'adoucissement de l'eau du \u00abr\u00e9servoir min\u00e9ral\u00bb bleu \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur. Pour plus de d\u00e9tails, voir la section ci-dessous.\n\n6. **Pour l'eau chaude: chauffe-eau solaire.** Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 haute pression, un tube flexible rouge va vers l'ext\u00e9rieur et monte sur le toit de la pi\u00e8ce \"Technique Locale\" vers le chauffe-eau solaire. Un autre tube rev\u00eatu de mati\u00e8re isolante noire descend de l\u00e0 et va aux robinets d'eau chaude du premier \u00e9tage. De cette fa\u00e7on, l'eau qui s'\u00e9coule du tube d'eau du toit \u00e0 travers le tube de riser est utilis\u00e9e pour pressuriser la conduite d'eau chaude et pour pousser l'eau \u00e0 travers le chauffe-eau solaire.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; Le chauffe-eau solaire est \u00e9quip\u00e9 d'un petit r\u00e9servoir tampon d'eau chaude fix\u00e9 \u00e0 son panneau solaire et d'une petite pompe \u00e9lectrique \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur. Le r\u00e9servoir tampon est toujours plein, car de l'eau froide y circule tout en \u00e9liminant l'eau chaude. La pompe sert \u00e0 faire circuler le fluide caloporteur dans une boucle ferm\u00e9e (ou peut-\u00eatre l'eau du r\u00e9servoir dans une boucle ouverte) entre le panneau et le r\u00e9servoir tampon. La pompe ne sert pas \u00e0 pressuriser l'alimentation en eau chaude, car si elle ne fonctionne pas, l'eau sortira des robinets mais sera froide (nous avons eu ce probl\u00e8me une fois). Cette pompe est connect\u00e9e \u00e0 une prise dans la chambre \"Locale Technique\" (\u00e0 gauche apr\u00e8s l'entr\u00e9e, dans le coin).\n\n7. **Plomberie d'eau.**\n\n    * **L'eau chaude** sort du r\u00e9servoir tampon du capteur solaire dans un tube recouvert d'un mat\u00e9riau isolant noir, entre et sort de la pi\u00e8ce \"Local Technique\", dans le sol, hors du sol pr\u00e8s du mur de la maison, puis monte \u00e0 travers un tube d'eau de pluie le long du mur de la maison, entre par le mur au premier \u00e9tage et va \u00e0 tous les robinets d'eau chaude l\u00e0.\n\n    * **L'eau froide** descend par gravit\u00e9 sous pression \u00e0 travers un tube s\u00e9par\u00e9 du r\u00e9servoir d'eau sur le toit. Il est visible comme un grand tube en plastique noir \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du tube d'eau de pluie qui contient \u00e9galement la ligne d'eau chaude ascendante. De l\u00e0, il semble aller autour de la maison, avec tous les appartements au niveau du sol connect\u00e9s de cette fa\u00e7on.\n\n8. **Chauffe-eau \u00e9lectriques.** Dans les appartements au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e, l'eau chaude est uniquement fournie par des chauffe-eau \u00e9lectriques de 1,2 kW avec un r\u00e9servoir tampon. L'un d'entre eux a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment install\u00e9 dans chacun des appartements \u00e0 notre arriv\u00e9e. Ils sont mont\u00e9s en ligne, apr\u00e8s une jonction de la ligne d'eau froide. Cela signifie que l'eau est \u00e9galement pressuris\u00e9e par gravit\u00e9 \u00e0 partir du r\u00e9servoir d'eau sur le toit.\n\nDe plus, il existe une connexion entre la tuyauterie haute pression et la tuyauterie basse pression dans la pi\u00e8ce \u00abLocale Technique\u00bb, avec une vanne ferm\u00e9e entre les deux qui est s\u00e9curis\u00e9e ferm\u00e9e avec du fil. Ne l'ouvrez pas, car toute l'eau du r\u00e9servoir d'eau sur le toit retournerait dans la citerne. Il est destin\u00e9 aux travaux de maintenance sur le r\u00e9servoir d'eau et le syst\u00e8me de tuyauterie sur le toit, \u00e9videmment.\n\nNotez que le syst\u00e8me d'eau de la maison n'inclut pas le r\u00e9servoir d'eau sur le toit (plus maintenant - cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment). Ceci peut \u00eatre vu par le fait que le manom\u00e8tre indique 1,6 - 2,6 bar, ce qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une hauteur de stockage de 16 - 26 m, alors que le r\u00e9servoir n'a que 8 m de hauteur. De plus, la pression change rapidement et jusqu'\u00e0 une barre lorsque la pompe fonctionne, ce qui est impossible lorsque la pression statique provient du r\u00e9servoir d'eau.\n\nLe r\u00e9servoir d'eau sur le toit est toujours utilis\u00e9, mais uniquement pour les jets d'eau de jardinage. Il a probablement remplac\u00e9 le petit r\u00e9servoir d'eau sur le garage, qui n'est plus utilis\u00e9.\n\n\n### 2.11. Entretien de l'adoucisseur <a name=\"chap-2-11\"> </a>\n\nL'adoucisseur d'eau est la grande machine \u00e0 bo\u00eete en plastique blanche de la salle Locale Technique. Pour une bonne introduction comment fonctionne l'adoucisseur d'eau, voir [cet article] (https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/interior-projects/how-to/a150/1275126/) par Popular Mechanics. Dans le syst\u00e8me, ici, le \u00abr\u00e9servoir min\u00e9ral\u00bb est la cuve sous pression bleue \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur et le \u00abflotteur et vanne\u00bb est la pi\u00e8ce cylindrique plus mince \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur. Toute la bo\u00eete en plastique contenant les deux sert \u00e9galement de r\u00e9servoir de saumure (ce qui signifie que vous remplissez le sel ici). Cet adoucisseur d'eau est d\u00e9j\u00e0 install\u00e9 et a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 (deux \u00e9tiquettes du fabricant sur \"quelque chose qui n'est pas install\u00e9\" restent, mais elles n'ont tout simplement pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9es pendant l'installation et peuvent \u00eatre ignor\u00e9es). Op\u00e9ration et maintenance:\n\n* **Fonctionnement normal** En fonctionnement normal, le contr\u00f4leur de vanne affichera trois \u00e9crans diff\u00e9rents avec des informations: la capacit\u00e9 restante en m\u00b3 jusqu'\u00e0 la prochaine r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration, l'heure actuelle et le d\u00e9bit actuel en litres par minute. Vous pouvez les parcourir avec la touche <kbd>NEXT</kbd>. Dans ce mode, la pression d'air dans le r\u00e9cipient de pression rouge \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la porte pousse simplement l'eau \u00e0 travers le r\u00e9servoir min\u00e9ral bleu quand un robinet est ouvert, et \u00e0 travers les billes de plastique \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur, les ions de calcium et de magn\u00e9sium adh\u00e8rent aux billes et les ions sodium des perles vont en solution dans l'eau (\"\u00e9change d'ions\"). La machine n'utilise pas d'\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique dans ce mode, sauf pour son d\u00e9bitm\u00e8tre d'eau qui compte le d\u00e9bit d'eau pour d\u00e9terminer l'heure du prochain cycle de r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration. Il fonctionnera \u00e9galement lorsqu'il est d\u00e9connect\u00e9 du courant jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le r\u00e9servoir min\u00e9ral perde sa capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de l'eau et qu'un cycle de r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration soit n\u00e9cessaire.\n\n* **Remplissage de sel.** Le sel se pr\u00e9sente sous forme de tablettes de sel qui sont vers\u00e9es dans le r\u00e9servoir de saumure. Il suffit d'enlever le couvercle en plastique et le couvercle octogonal pour y acc\u00e9der - c'est le r\u00e9servoir contenant \u00e9galement le r\u00e9servoir min\u00e9ral bleu et mince flotteur cylindrique et l'ensemble de la vanne. La bonne quantit\u00e9 est de remplir le r\u00e9servoir \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 avec des pastilles de sel, en v\u00e9rifiant une fois par mois et en remplissant si n\u00e9cessaire (voir [ici] (http://homewater101.com/often-add-salt-water-softener) pour plus de d\u00e9tails). Cela sera \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 7-10 cm au-dessus du niveau de l'eau dans le r\u00e9servoir de saumure apr\u00e8s un cycle de r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration, tel que recommand\u00e9 dans d'autres sources en ligne.\n\n    Le contr\u00f4leur de vanne peut afficher un \"avertissement de faible teneur en sel\" bas\u00e9 sur la quantit\u00e9 de sel ajout\u00e9e la derni\u00e8re fois et une quantit\u00e9 programmable qui est utilis\u00e9e par cycle de r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration. Nous n'avons pas encore d\u00e9couvert si la machine utilis\u00e9e ici a cette fonction activ\u00e9e (c'est-\u00e0-dire, si jamais elle affichera \"SALT FILL\"). Il est prudent d'ignorer cette fonction et de toujours garder le r\u00e9servoir de sel \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 plein, en v\u00e9rifiant environ une fois par mois. Sinon, pour que la fonction d'avertissement de sel reste fonctionnelle, vous devrez entrer la quantit\u00e9 de sel dans le r\u00e9servoir apr\u00e8s l'avoir rempli, comme indiqu\u00e9 dans le [manuel](http://clackvalves.net/pdf/documents/CI%20programming%20manual.pdf), p. 16. Cela semble inutile tracas, alors laissez simplement ignorer cette \"fonctionnalit\u00e9\" m\u00eame si elle existe ...\n\n* **Cycle de r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration.** La r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration se fera automatiquement apr\u00e8s une certaine quantit\u00e9 d'eau, mais elle peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9e manuellement. Pour ce faire: v\u00e9rifiez d'abord que le r\u00e9servoir de saumure contient assez de sel. Si ce n'est pas le cas, remplissez le sel et attendez au moins deux heures avant de commencer la r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration (cela n'a de sens que s'il y a aussi de l'eau dans le r\u00e9servoir de saumure, alors assurez-vous \u00e9galement). Ensuite, appuyez bri\u00e8vement sur le bouton <kbd>REGEN</kbd> et v\u00e9rifiez que \"REGEN TODAY\" appara\u00eet \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran - cela d\u00e9clenchera une r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration retard\u00e9e pendant la nuit. Si vous appuyez \u00e0 nouveau bri\u00e8vement sur le bouton <kbd>REGEN</kbd>, la requ\u00eate sera annul\u00e9e. Vous pouvez \u00e9galement d\u00e9clencher un cycle de r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration imm\u00e9diat - pour cela, appuyez sur <kbd>REGEN</kbd> pendant trois secondes (notez qu'il n'y a aucun moyen d'annuler une telle requ\u00eate). En outre, il n'y a aucun moyen d'arr\u00eater un cycle de r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration une fois qu'il est en cours. Source: le [manuel](http://clackvalves.net/pdf/documents/CI%20programming%20manual.pdf), p. 14.\n\n    Le cycle de r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration dure environ 75 minutes au total et se compose de: 5 min \"Rinse\", 60 min \"Brine Up\", 4 min de rin\u00e7age, 5 min de remplissage (dur\u00e9es approximatives). Dans toutes les phases, il y a de l'eau qui coule \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 travers le tuyau orange - dans la phase \"Brine Up\" c'est \u00e0 faible d\u00e9bit, sinon avec un d\u00e9bit important, environ 150 l au total. L'eau coule sur le sol \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur maintenant, mais une meilleure solution doit \u00eatre trouv\u00e9e car elle contient de l'eau sale et tr\u00e8s sal\u00e9e.\n\n    Une fois le cycle de r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration termin\u00e9, l'\u00e9cran \u00abcapacit\u00e9 restante\u00bb indique environ 20,5 m\u00b3 (20 500 l) pouvant \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 la prochaine r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration. Comme la machine conna\u00eet l'heure actuelle, elle effectuera la r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration la nuit, sauf si elle est d\u00e9marr\u00e9e manuellement pour une ex\u00e9cution imm\u00e9diate. Cela est logique, car pendant la r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration, aucun adoucissement de l'eau n'est possible, de sorte que l'eau dure sera fournie aux robinets (\"S'il y a une demande d'eau lorsque le syst\u00e8me se r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e8re, de l'eau non trait\u00e9e sera utilis\u00e9e.\"](http://clackvalves.net/pdf/documents/CI%20programming%20manual.pdf), page 14).\n\n* **Configuration de l'heure** Si l'adoucisseur d'eau est hors tension pendant plus de 24 heures, il oublie l'heure, mais n'oubliez pas tous les autres r\u00e9glages. Si vous faites d\u00e9filer les \u00e9crans en appuyant sur <kbd>NEXT</kbd> et sur l'\u00e9cran de l'heure, l'heure affich\u00e9e en mode clignotant indique qu'elle doit \u00eatre configur\u00e9e. Pour ce faire: Appuyez sur <kbd>SET CLOCK</kbd>, r\u00e9glez le r\u00e9glage de l'heure avec les touches fl\u00e9ch\u00e9es, appuyez sur <kbd>NEXT</kbd>, ajustez le r\u00e9glage des minutes avec les touches fl\u00e9ch\u00e9es, appuyez sur <kbd>NEXT</kbd> pour terminer le processus. <kbd>REGEN</kbd> peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour passer \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente dans ce processus.

R\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 la connexion Internet <a name=\"chap-2-12\"> </a>\n\n**R\u00e9solution des probl\u00e8mes de connexion:** \u00c9tapes recommand\u00e9es, dans cet ordre:\n\n1. **Trouver et arr\u00eater l'utilisation intensive.** Lorsque la connexion Internet est \"l\u00e0, mais tr\u00e8s lent\", il est presque exclusivement d\u00fb \u00e0 un p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique utilisant Internet tr\u00e8s fortement. Vous pouvez v\u00e9rifier les temps de ping: `ping 8.8.8.8` (vers le serveur de noms Google) renvoyant des temps de ping moyens de ~ 56 ms est\" normalement rapide Internet \", et la plage typique pour pinguer les serveurs europ\u00e9ens est de 82 - 95 ms. Tout temps de ping> 150 ms indique la condition \"Internet lent et inutilisable\". Pour trouver l'utilisateur lourd, \u00e0 la fois dans le [routeur TP-Link \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage] (http://192.168.0.253/) et [routeur TP-Link en bas] (http://192.168.0.252/) vous allez \u00e0 \"Wireless \u2192 Statistiques sans fil \"et actualisez plusieurs fois pour identifier le p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique client dont les num\u00e9ros de paquets augmentent le plus rapidement. Vous pouvez ensuite comparer l'adresse MAC indiqu\u00e9e avec les adresses MAC des p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques connect\u00e9s (en garder une liste et rechercher en ligne comment les trouver sur diff\u00e9rents appareils).\n\n2. **Red\u00e9marrez les routeurs wifi.** Les routeurs qui fonctionnent pendant des semaines sans red\u00e9marrer peuvent devenir lents en raison d'erreurs logicielles, ils doivent donc \u00eatre red\u00e9marr\u00e9s de temps en temps. Cela a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 avec le [routeur TP-Link en bas](http://192.168.0.252/), mais peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre vrai pour le [routeur TP-Link en haut](http://192.168.0.253/). Vous pouvez les red\u00e9marrer \u00e0 partir de leur interface de menu d'administration, ou en coupant l'alimentation \u00e9lectrique d'une seconde (il suffit de brancher le c\u00e2ble d'alimentation).\n\n3. **Red\u00e9marrez le routeur \u00e0 large bande.** Le routeur \u00e0 large bande deviendra \u00e9galement lent lors de l'ex\u00e9cution pendant environ deux semaines sans red\u00e9marrer. En outre, un red\u00e9marrage cr\u00e9era une nouvelle connexion haut d\u00e9bit mobile, qui pourrait r\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes de bande passante de l'ancienne connexion, et met souvent fin \u00e0 un lourd cas d'utilisation d'Internet (comme le streaming vid\u00e9o ou un appel vid\u00e9o) \u00e0 la Chambre. Pour red\u00e9marrer le routeur haut d\u00e9bit mobile, [visitez son interface d'administration](http://192.168.0.254/), allez dans \"Menu \u2192 Param\u00e8tres \u2192 Syst\u00e8me \u2192 Red\u00e9marrer\" et cliquez sur le bouton \"Red\u00e9marrer\". (Pour vous connecter, utilisez les informations d'identification \"admin / admin\" par d\u00e9faut.) Alternativement et plus simplement, vous pouvez couper l'alimentation \u00e9lectrique pendant une seconde en commutant le fusible no. 18 \u00e9teint et \u00e0 nouveau (situ\u00e9 dans la bo\u00eete \u00e0 fusibles \u00e0 gauche apr\u00e8s \u00eatre entr\u00e9 dans la porte principale de la zone de vie \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage et \u00e9tiquet\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de cette bo\u00eete \u00e0 fusibles).\n\n4. **Rechargez la carte SIM Orange.** Le probl\u00e8me le plus courant est que nous \u00e9puisons le volume mensuel de donn\u00e9es de 40 Gio, auquel cas la connexion Internet s'arr\u00eatera pour fonctionner. (Le routeur haut d\u00e9bit mobile peut toujours afficher l'\u00e9tat de la connexion comme \"Connect\u00e9\", mais aucun transfert de donn\u00e9es n'est possible, et apr\u00e8s une d\u00e9connexion manuelle, aucune nouvelle connexion n'est possible.)\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; Pour le recharger, vous devez activer un \"[Orange Pass Internet](http://www.orange.ma/Offres-services/Offres-Internet/Forfaits-Orange-Internet)\". Le moyen le plus simple est d'acheter simplement un paquet internet appropri\u00e9 sur [recharge.orange.ma](http://recharge.orange.ma/) pour le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \"+ 212660767305\". Il n'a pas besoin de connexion, fonctionne bien avec les cartes de cr\u00e9dit internationales et a un effet imm\u00e9diat. Dans la configuration actuelle avec le routeur haut d\u00e9bit mobile Orange Flybox Home, aucune action manuelle n'est n\u00e9cessaire par la suite - il suffit d'attendre 3-5 minutes avant que le routeur n'\u00e9tablisse une nouvelle connexion par lui-m\u00eame. (Si vous voulez que cela se produise plus rapidement, allez \u00e0 [http://192.168.0.254/](http://192.168.0.254/) et cliquez sur le bouton \"connecter / d\u00e9connecter Internet\" en haut \u00e0 gauche jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'une nouvelle connexion soit \u00e9tabli.)\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; **Important:** Il est \u00e9vident que vous avez besoin d'une connexion Internet pour r\u00e9server un nouveau forfait Internet pour la maison. Assurez-vous donc de garder un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone / une tablette avec un petit paquet de donn\u00e9es appropri\u00e9 pour de tels cas (ou alternativement, certains codes de recharge suffisent pour acheter le plus petit forfait Internet pour votre appareil mobile, soit 5 MAD). Rendez-vous sur le toit-terrasse (pour une bonne connexion r\u00e9seau) et r\u00e9servez directement le nouveau forfait Internet avec l'appareil mobile ou placez l'appareil mobile en mode point d'acc\u00e8s sur le toit-terrasse pr\u00e8s des fen\u00eatres occidentales puis r\u00e9servez un nouveau forfait Internet confortablement votre ordinateur \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la maison. Votre choix: P\n\n5. **Utiliser une autre connexion haut d\u00e9bit mobile.** Nous disposons d'une connexion haut d\u00e9bit mobile redondante mise \u00e0 disposition par un deuxi\u00e8me op\u00e9rateur de r\u00e9seau mobile (Maroc Telecom au lieu d'Orange). Maroc Telecom a une excellente force de signal 4G sur le toit de la maison. Pour l'activer, laissez @matthias mettre sa tablette en mode hotspot, ou utilisez un autre appareil Android en mode hotspot.\n\n6. **Parlez \u00e0 @matthias.** Il a plus d'informations sur le r\u00e9seau, y compris les fichiers de sauvegarde des param\u00e8tres du routeur.\n\n7. **Appelez le service client\u00e8le d'Orange.** Si n\u00e9cessaire, il vous suffit d'appeler le service client Orange et de lui indiquer le num\u00e9ro sur votre carte SIM (`+ 212660767305`).\n\n8. **Appelez l'administrateur du r\u00e9seau.** Un coll\u00e8gue de notre bricoleur a install\u00e9 la connexion Internet \u00e0 la maison. Son num\u00e9ro est dans la section avec les informations projet\u00e9es ci-dessous.\n\n**Configuration de la connexion Internet:**\n\n* **Type.** Connexion haut d\u00e9bit mobile (4G via le r\u00e9seau Orange) \u00e0 la prochaine tour du r\u00e9seau mobile, proche du centre de Sidi Kaouki, \u00e0 2,5 km en visibilit\u00e9 directe.\n\n* **FAI.** L'op\u00e9rateur de r\u00e9seau mobile \"Orange\" est notre FAI.\n\n* **Contrat.** Le contrat avec Orange est un contrat d'un an cr\u00e9\u00e9 par notre propri\u00e9taire. L'heure de d\u00e9but est inconnue, mais couvre notre s\u00e9jour jusqu'\u00e0 la fin d'avril au moins. \u00c0 partir du 2018-02-01, il fournit 40 Gio / mois de volume de donn\u00e9es inclus. Pour Maroc Telecom, nous utilisons des forfaits Internet book sur une carte SIM pr\u00e9pay\u00e9e, sans contrat d'ex\u00e9cution.\n\n**Configuration du r\u00e9seau local:** Le LAN de la maison est `192.168.0.0 / 24` et contient tous ses p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques r\u00e9seau. Dispositifs d'infrastructure de haut en bas:\n\n1. **Commutateur.** Un commutateur Fast Ethernet \u00e0 cinq ports mod\u00e8le \"Tenda S105\" sur le toit, sur le dessus du r\u00e9servoir d'eau. Quatre ports sont utilis\u00e9s, un pour chacun des trois routeurs et un pour le syst\u00e8me d'enregistrement vid\u00e9o.\n\n2. **Routeur \"toit\" (192.168.0.254).** Un routeur sur le toit, sur le dessus du r\u00e9servoir d'eau.

Il a plusieurs r\u00f4les: (1) routeur haut d\u00e9bit mobile, avec la carte SIM ins\u00e9r\u00e9e directement dans celui-ci, (2) serveur DHCP pour l'ensemble du r\u00e9seau local. Le Wifi a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sactiv\u00e9 dans ce routeur. Le routeur est tr\u00e8s probablement SIM verrouill\u00e9 sur les cartes SIM Orange.\n\n3. **Router \"living hall\" (192.168.0.253).** Situ\u00e9 dans un coin de la salle de s\u00e9jour. L'interface d'administration est http://192.168.0.253/, utilisateur \"` admin` \", mot de passe\" `admin`\". Fournit le wifi au premier \u00e9tage avec SSID \"DAR NEZHA\". Poss\u00e8de \u00e9galement des ports Ethernet gratuits pour se connecter \u00e0 Internet par c\u00e2ble. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les clients Wi-Fi et Ethernet de ce routeur doivent \u00eatre dans le m\u00eame r\u00e9seau que le reste de la maison, le c\u00e2ble Ethernet bleu destin\u00e9 au routeur \u00abrooftop\u00bb doit entrer dans l'un des quatre ports Ethernet orange, et non dans le port WAN. La connexion \u00e0 l'interrupteur sur le toit est faite avec un c\u00e2ble qui passe directement \u00e0 travers la paroi ext\u00e9rieure dans une petite bo\u00eete de distribution \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur, puis, dans un tube gris, le long du mur et jusqu'\u00e0 la toiture.\n\n5. **Routeur \"appartement 1\" (192.168.0.252).** Une petite bo\u00eete dans l'appartement 1, pr\u00e8s de la fen\u00eatre. Mod\u00e8le TP-LINK TL-MR3020. L'interface d'administration est http://192.168.0.252/, utilisateur \"` admin` \", mot de passe\" `admin`\". fournit wifi en bas et autour de la piscine avec SSID \"DAR NEZHA AP1\". La connexion \u00e0 l'interrupteur de toit est faite avec un c\u00e2ble qui traverse le cadre de la fen\u00eatre, puis dans un tube gris le long du mur jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il se connecte le m\u00eame tube que le c\u00e2ble provenant de la \"salle de s\u00e9jour\" routeur.\n\n\n### 2.13.

Voir notre [manuel d'instructions Dynalist](/t/id/7618) pour cette instruction et d'autres.\n\nNous avons marqu\u00e9 tous les magasins et march\u00e9s potentiellement int\u00e9ressants sur [notre carte d'adresses d'Essaouira] (http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/id_193062), mais les points suivants m\u00e9ritent une description plus longue:\n\n**Commerces et March\u00e9s**\n\n* **March\u00e9 aux puces d'Essaouira** Il y a un march\u00e9 aux puces \u00e0 Essaouira tous les dimanches de (t\u00f4t le matin) \u00e0 d\u00e9but d'apr\u00e8s-midi (les premiers vendeurs commencent \u00e0 faire leurs bagages vers 14h30). L'emplacement est le long de l'avenue Molay Hicham, de [ici](https://goo.gl/maps/8YcvUAw4S1Q2) \u00e0 [ici](https://goo.gl/maps/yfQ36VwYSuv). Vous trouverez toutes sortes de nouveaux / vieux / outils cass\u00e9s, articles m\u00e9nagers, pi\u00e8ces de bicyclettes et accessoires, bicyclettes, appareils \u00e9lectroniques et aussi quelques v\u00eatements et articles alimentaires. Le quartier nord est un march\u00e9 de fruits et l\u00e9gumes.\n\n* **Rue de la malbouffe d'Essaouira.** Beaucoup de petits magasins et toute une zone de squatters autour de [cette rue](https://goo.gl/maps/GT7wrPbwmcy). La plupart vendent des articles et des mat\u00e9riaux r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s, y compris des portes et des fen\u00eatres, des outils, des articles m\u00e9nagers et des rebuts. La zone de squatters abrite \u00e9galement deux ou trois galeries d'art / salles d'exposition par des artistes locaux (voir notre carte de POI pour les emplacements).\n\n* **March\u00e9 alimentaire de Smimou.** Selon les t\u00e9moignages, il y a un march\u00e9 de nourriture tous les dimanches \u00e0 Smimou, une ville situ\u00e9e \u00e0 24 km au sud de la maison. Nous ne l'avons pas encore visit\u00e9, mais il semble que les locaux pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent y aller plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 Gazhoua ou Essaouira. Pour vous y rendre, vous pouvez prendre le microbus de Sidi Kaouki (voir section [\"Atteindre la maison \u2192 De Sidi Kaouki\"](#chap-1-1) \"), id\u00e9alement attrap\u00e9 juste devant la maison.\n\n* **Avito petites annonces.** [Avito] (https://www.avito.ma/) est le plus grand portail en ligne du Maroc pour les petites annonces. La province d'Essaouira en compte \u00e0 elle seule des centaines dans toutes sortes de biens d'occasion.\n\n* **Pages jaunes d'Essaouira.** Le site [essaouira.madeinmedina.com](https://essaouira.madeinmedina.com/fr/) fournit le r\u00e9pertoire d'entreprises et de services le plus complet que nous ayons trouv\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent pour Essaouira. Dans notre exp\u00e9rience, les emplacements des cartes ne sont souvent qu'\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s exactes: si vous ne trouvez pas ce que vous cherchez, demandez autour de vous, il se pourrait que vous soyez \u00e0 200 m\u00e8tres.\n\n\n### 3.4. Shopping dans les grandes villes et \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger <a name=\"chap-3-4\"> </a>\n\nDes outils, des produits \u00e9lectroniques et des produits alimentaires assez sp\u00e9ciaux ne sont pas disponibles dans la r\u00e9gion, mais certains peuvent \u00eatre obtenus via le shopping en ligne au Maroc et d'autres peuvent \u00eatre apport\u00e9s par des personnes venant \u00e0 la maison (\u00ablogistique du ferroutage\u00bb).\n\n** Achats en ligne au Maroc **\n\nIl n'y a pas trop d'options, mais nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait de bonnes exp\u00e9riences avec ce qui suit:\n\n* ** [iris](https://www.iris.ma/).** Grande boutique en ligne marocaine pour l'\u00e9lectronique informatique / photo / vid\u00e9o / audio et similaire. Ils peuvent refuser la premi\u00e8re commande lors de la commande aupr\u00e8s de Sidi Kaouki, mais il suffit de les contacter et ils organiseront l'exp\u00e9dition au bureau de poste le plus proche \u00e0 Smimou d'o\u00f9 vous pouvez prendre livraison.\n\n**Shopping \u00e0 distance: Demander quelque chose**\n\n1. Ajouter l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e0 [notre dynaliste](https://dynalist.io/d/8I41AdtRSel0ZFVKeNvovZzv) et l'\u00e9tiqueter `#remote-shopping`. S'il est potentiellement disponible dans la zone locale, cela ne fait pas de mal \u00e0 le taguer \u00abshopping\u00bb.\n2. Ajouter une section de note \u00e0 l'article expliquant o\u00f9 l'acheter ou o\u00f9 le commander en ligne etc.\n3. Ajoutez une balise `#by-username` \u00e0 l'item Dynalist afin que la personne qui re\u00e7oit l'objet puisse vous demander des clarifications quand vous en avez besoin et sait comment vous faire rembourser les frais.\n4. N'oubliez pas de r\u00e9gler la d\u00e9pense lorsque votre article arrive.\n\nVoir notre [manuel d'instructions Dynalist](/t/id/7618) pour des instructions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales.\n\n**Shopping \u00e0 distance: apporter quelque chose**\n\n1. Avant de vous rendre \u00e0 la Maison, veuillez consulter [notre liste de \"vente \u00e0 distance\"](https://dynalist.io/d/8I41AdtRSel0ZFVKeNvovZzv#q=%23remote-shopping%20-is%3Acompleted) pour tout ce qui peut vous \u00eatre utile Comme certains articles peuvent \u00eatre command\u00e9s en ligne, m\u00eame \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger, id\u00e9alement, v\u00e9rifiez deux semaines \u00e0 l'avance, puis de nouveau plus tard pour les demandes \u00e0 court pr\u00e9avis.\n\n2. Demandez \u00e0 la personne qui a besoin d'un article d'apporter des pr\u00e9cisions si n\u00e9cessaire (en particulier pour les d\u00e9penses plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es et lorsque vous soup\u00e7onnez que la liste pourrait ne pas \u00eatre \u00e0 jour). L'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de liste dans Dynalist doit contenir des informations de contact, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sous la forme d'une balise `# by-username` contenant un nom d'utilisateur edgeryders.eu. Dans ce cas, recherchez le nom d'utilisateur sur edgeryders.eu et envoyez-leur un message direct pour les contacter.\n\n3. Achetez l'article, ou laissez la personne qui le demande le commander en ligne et l'envoyer \u00e0 votre adresse.\n\n4. Imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l'achat, marquez l'article comme \"termin\u00e9\" dans Dynalist (\"appuyez sur <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Retour</kbd>\").\n\n5. R\u00e9glez les frais avec la personne qui les demande lorsque vous venez \u00e0 la Chambre.\n\nVoir notre [manuel d'instructions Dynalist](/t/id/7618) pour des instructions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales.\n\n\n### 3.5. Obtention et configuration d'une carte SIM locale <a name=\"chap-3-5\"> </a>\n\nEn bref, ce sont les \u00e9tapes pour utiliser les appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques et Internet mobile avec une carte SIM marocaine locale. Si vous avez besoin de plus de d\u00e9tails, vous pouvez demander \u00e0 @matthias.\n\n1. **Acheter une carte SIM Maroc Telecom.** Maroc Telecom dispose du meilleur r\u00e9seau autour de la maison, et en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au Maroc. (Les deux autres r\u00e9seaux sont Inwi et Orange, Inwi fonctionne bien autour de la maison mais n'offre pas de service 4G.Orange ne fonctionne que sur le toit.) Filtrer [notre carte d'adresses d'Essaouira](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/id_193062) pour \"SIM\" pour voir les points de vente des cartes Maroc Telecom etc. Ils co\u00fbtent 30 MAD, et il n'y a pas besoin d'un passeport ou d'autres documents lors de leur achat. Nous disposons \u00e9galement de quelques cartes SIM Maroc Telecom \u00e0 la disposition des visiteurs.\n\n2. **Acheter des cartes de recharge** pour les cartes SIM Maroc Telecom. Voir notre carte de localisation pour les magasins qui les ont. Obtenez une carte de 50 MAD pour chaque mois de votre s\u00e9jour si vous voulez un Internet mobile permanent et des cartes de 10 \u00e0 20 MAD pour les appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques en fonction de l'utilisation. De plus, nous devrions avoir des cartes de recharge \u00e0 la Chambre.\n\n    **Les m\u00e9thodes de recharge alternatives** sont la \u00abrecharge express\u00bb dans les magasins (de l'\u00e9quilibre t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique ou Internet), ou la recharge en ligne. En ce qui concerne la recharge en ligne, [recharge.com](https://www.recharge.com/fr/morocco/maroc-telecom-top-up) fonctionne (carte de cr\u00e9dit, ou si cela \u00e9choue PayPal) mais prend une commission de 20%. Aussi [prepaidunion.com](https://www.prepaidunion.com/fr/recharge/country/Maroc_Maroc-telecom) offre une recharge avec Paypal (test\u00e9, avec succ\u00e8s) et toutes les principales cartes de cr\u00e9dit (pas encore test\u00e9). Il y a plus de services de tiers, que nous n'avons pas encore test\u00e9s. Alors que le fonctionnaire [Recharge Maroc Telecom en ligne](https://paiement.iam.ma/recharge/pel_recharge.jsp) ne fonctionne pas avec les cartes de cr\u00e9dit internationales, ce qui est leur seule option de paiement adapt\u00e9e aux voyageurs.\n\n3. **Activez la carte SIM.** Ins\u00e9rez-la dans un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, appelez quelqu'un et appuyez sur \u00ab0\u00bb lorsque vous entendez le message vocal. Apr\u00e8s cela, la carte SIM est active et votre appel sera ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 normalement.\n\n4. **Rechargez votre solde d'appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.** Envoyez un SMS au num\u00e9ro `555` et comme contenu le code de recharge de votre carte (par exemple` 48107139762872`). Vous recevrez imm\u00e9diatement un SMS confirmant la recharge (\"Votre compte Jawal a \u00e9t\u00e9 recharg\u00e9 de ... DH\").\n\n5. **R\u00e9server un forfait Internet mobile.**\n\n    1. **Choisissez une carte de recharge.** Le montant de recharge de la carte d\u00e9termine le paquet que vous r\u00e9servez. Pour un acc\u00e8s permanent \u00e0 Internet, choisissez une carte de 50 MAD, ce qui vous donne un package de 5 GiB pendant 30 jours et est le plus petit paquet valide depuis longtemps. Voir aussi la [liste compl\u00e8te des forfaits Internet](https://www.iam.ma/particulier/internet-adsl-3g/offres-cles-3g/sans-abonnement.aspx).\n\n    2. **Envoyer un SMS au num\u00e9ro** `555` et comme contenu le code de recharge de votre carte suivi de` * 3` pour indiquer que vous voulez r\u00e9server un forfait Internet. Ainsi, par exemple, `48107139762872 * 3`\n\n    3. **Vous recevrez un SMS** imm\u00e9diatement, confirmant votre r\u00e9servation.\n\n6. **Configurer les param\u00e8tres Internet mobile.** V\u00e9rifiez les param\u00e8tres APN de la configuration Internet mobile de votre appareil mobile. S'il a une configuration APN active avec APN `www.iamgprs1.ma` alors la configuration automatique a r\u00e9ussi. Sinon, cr\u00e9ez et activez manuellement cette configuration APN avec:\n\n    * **APN:** `www.iamgprs1.ma`\n    * **nom d'utilisateur:** laisser vide\n    * **mot de passe:** laisser vide\n    * **autres champs:** laisser aux valeurs par d\u00e9faut\n\n7. **Les appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques et l'Internet mobile devraient maintenant fonctionner.** L'Internet mobile cessera de fonctionner une fois le temps d'ex\u00e9cution ou le volume de donn\u00e9es de votre forfait Internet \u00e9puis\u00e9, alors gardez une carte de recharge appropri\u00e9e avec vous pour la renouveler.\n\n\n### 3.6. En utilisant notre carte des points d'int\u00e9r\u00eat <a name=\"chap-3-6\"> </a>\n\nCeci est une introduction incompl\u00e8te \u00e0 OsmAnd ~ et [uMap] (http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/).[OsmAnd~](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/) est le meilleur logiciel de cartographie open source pour Android, et uMap est un service gratuit bas\u00e9 sur le web pour la cr\u00e9ation collaborative de cartes personnalis\u00e9es en ligne. C'est un logiciel compl\u00e8tement open source et utilise des donn\u00e9es cartographiques gratuites d'OpenStreetMap. Les instructions suivantes se r\u00e9f\u00e8rent \u00e0 [notre uMap \"POI Essaouira\"](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/id_193062), faite pour le projet OpenVillage Academy, et incluent des conventions d\u00e9finies pour cette carte.\n\n**Utilisation de la carte de POI dans un navigateur**\n\n1. Ouvrez simplement [notre uMap](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/id_193062) dans votre navigateur, soit sur un ordinateur de bureau, soit sur un appareil mobile.\n2. Lorsque vous ouvrez la carte initialement, un panneau de recherche est disponible sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit. Tapez n'importe quoi l\u00e0 et une recherche sur tous les noms de nos marqueurs de carte POI sera faite.\n3. Si vous fermez ce panneau et que vous voulez le r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer plus tard, vous pouvez le trouver en cliquant sur l'ic\u00f4ne \"Map Layers\" dans la colonne de gauche des ic\u00f4nes, puis sur le bouton \"Browse data\".\n\n**Utilisation de la carte de POI en mode hors connexion**\n\nCeci est utile lorsque vous voyagez, car vous ne savez pas si vous disposez d'une connexion de donn\u00e9es op\u00e9rationnelle \u00e0 tout moment. Cela fonctionne avec tous les appareils Android.\n\n1. Installez l'application [OsmAnd~](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/) de F-Droid sur votre appareil Android.\n2. Dans l'application, t\u00e9l\u00e9chargez la carte de la couche de base mondiale et la carte du Maroc.\n3. Ouvrez [notre carte](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/id_193062) sur votre appareil mobile, cliquez sur l'ic\u00f4ne \"Partager\" sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche.\n4. Choisissez \"T\u00e9l\u00e9charger les donn\u00e9es \u2192 gpx\", cliquez sur \"T\u00e9l\u00e9charger les donn\u00e9es\" et enregistrez le fichier dans le dossier \"T\u00e9l\u00e9chargements\".\n5. Passez \u00e0 OsmAnd~ et allez dans \"menu principal \u2192 Mes lieux\".\n6. Cliquez sur \"+\" dans le coin inf\u00e9rieur gauche, s\u00e9lectionnez \"Ouvrir depuis \u2192 T\u00e9l\u00e9chargements\" et s\u00e9lectionnez le fichier GPX de uMap que vous venez d'enregistrer. Il sera import\u00e9 dans une nouvelle cat\u00e9gorie \"Mes lieux\".\n7. Si vous avez suivi ce processus auparavant, vous pouvez d\u00e9sormais masquer ou supprimer toutes les cat\u00e9gories dans \"Mes lieux\" contenant les versions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes de ce fichier GPX. Toutes ces donn\u00e9es sont toujours contenues dans la derni\u00e8re version que vous venez d'importer.\n8. Utilisez l'ic\u00f4ne \"Recherche\" dans \"menu principal \u2192 Mes adresses\" dans OsmAnd~ pour trouver quelque chose dans notre carte de POI, ou tapez simplement sur les marqueurs de carte dans votre voisinage pour voir ce qui est autour.\n\n**Contribuer des donn\u00e9es de POI \u00e0 la carte dans un navigateur**\n\nC'est la solution la plus confortable, esp. pour ajouter un ou plusieurs points. Mais \u00e9videmment, cela ne fonctionne pas sans acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet (r\u00e9ception correcte du r\u00e9seau mobile, forfait Internet r\u00e9serv\u00e9).\n\n1. Ouvrez simplement [notre uMap](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/id_193062) dans votre navigateur, soit sur un ordinateur de bureau, soit sur un appareil mobile.\n2. Cliquez sur l'ic\u00f4ne \"Activer l'\u00e9dition\" en haut \u00e0 droite.\n3. Cliquez sur l'ic\u00f4ne \"Dessiner un marqueur\" en haut \u00e0 droite et tracez un marqueur sur votre carte.\n4. Dans la liste d\u00e9roulante \"S\u00e9lectionnez la couche de la fonctionnalit\u00e9\", s\u00e9lectionnez le sujet appropri\u00e9: M\u00e9dical, Transport, Commercial (magasins, restaurants), Argent (distributeurs automatiques de billets, banques et bureaux de change) ou Divers (pour les \"autres articles\"). Cela affecte automatiquement la couleur du marqueur.\n5. Entrez un nom et une description. Le nom doit contenir tout ce que les gens peuvent utiliser pour rechercher ce point d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, car le champ de description n'est pas consultable.\n6. Cliquez sur \"Propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de la forme \u2192 Symbole de l'ic\u00f4ne \u2192 D\u00e9finir\" et s\u00e9lectionnez une ic\u00f4ne blanche appropri\u00e9e.\n7. Cliquez sur \"Enregistrer\" en haut \u00e0 droite et attendez le message de confirmation.\n8. Lorsque vous avez termin\u00e9 votre session d'\u00e9dition, cliquez sur \"D\u00e9sactiver l'\u00e9dition\".\n\n**Contribution des donn\u00e9es de POI \u00e0 la carte hors ligne**\n\nCeci est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable lorsque vous ajoutez des POI dans des zones sans couverture de r\u00e9seau mobile pour l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet, et lorsque vous utilisez l'application OsmAnd ~ pour la navigation et que vous ne souhaitez pas passer \u00e0 l'application de navigation pour ajouter un autre POI.\n\n1. Cette solution utilise la m\u00eame application \"OsmAnd~\" que dans les instructions \"Utiliser la carte POI offline\" ci-dessus, donc si vous ne l'avez pas encore fait, installez le [OsmAnd~](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/) application de F-Droid sur votre appareil Android et dans l'application, t\u00e9l\u00e9chargez la carte de la couche de base mondiale et la carte du Maroc.\n2. Faites le tour et quand vous voyez un POI qui n'est pas encore sur notre carte, appuyez longuement sur l'\u00e9cran dans OsmAnd~ \u00e0 l'emplacement du point et cr\u00e9ez un marqueur \"favori\". Mettez tout dans le titre qui pourrait \u00eatre pertinent pour les personnes qui recherchent cela, car \u00e0 la fois dans uMap et OsmAnd~ la recherche ne couvre que le nom, pas la description. Mettez des informations suppl\u00e9mentaires comme les heures d'ouverture des magasins dans la description.\n3. Enregistrez ce favori dans une cat\u00e9gorie comme \"POIs 1 Essaouira\", en utilisant le prochain num\u00e9ro gratuit.\n4. Apr\u00e8s quelques jours lorsque vous avez suffisamment cartographi\u00e9 et que vous souhaitez placer vos points sur la carte de partage, renommez votre cat\u00e9gorie en \"POIs 1 d'Essaouira (en uMap)\".\n5. Dans \"menu principal \u2192 Mes lieux\", allez dans le menu \u00e0 trois points de la cat\u00e9gorie \u00e0 exporter et cliquez sur \"Partager \u2192 Enregistrer sous ...\". Enregistrez-le dans le dossier \"T\u00e9l\u00e9chargements\" ou similaire.\n6. Ouvrez [notre carte](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/id_193062) sur votre appareil mobile, puis cliquez sur le bouton en forme de crayon en haut \u00e0 droite pour modifier la carte.\n7. Cliquez sur l'ic\u00f4ne: arrow_up: pour importer les donn\u00e9es et s\u00e9lectionner le fichier GPX que vous venez d'enregistrer. Pour que la couche puisse l'importer, s\u00e9lectionnez-en une nomm\u00e9e \"by @username\" (en utilisant votre nom d'utilisateur Edgeryders). Chacun a sa propre couche pour ses propres donn\u00e9es, ce qui prot\u00e8ge contre la suppression / \u00e9crasement accidentel, etc.\n8. Finalisation de vos donn\u00e9es de PI utiles en les \u00e9ditant dans un navigateur. Ouvrez chaque POI pour l'\u00e9diter une fois et suivez les \u00e9tapes de la section \"Contribuer aux donn\u00e9es de POI sur la carte dans un navigateur\" pour d\u00e9finir le calque, le nom, la description et le symbole selon nos conventions dans cette carte.\n\n**Donn\u00e9es ponctuelles contributives pour OpenStreetMap**\n\nCela couvre les \u00e9tapes d'obtenir des donn\u00e9es ponctuelles dans uMap qui sont destin\u00e9es \u00e0 les ajouter ult\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 OpenStreetMap: POI, d\u00e9but et fin de parcours, notes d'utilisateurs g\u00e9olocalis\u00e9es destin\u00e9es \u00e0 vous aider \u00e0 \u00e9diter OpenStreetMap plus tard.

Assez loin pour que le ranin et le vent combin\u00e9s ne puissent pas les rendre humides.\n\n2. N'utilisez pas le v\u00e9lo sur la plage, sauf si vous savez ce que vous faites. (Conduire la bicyclette sur du sable dur et humide n'apporte pas de sable dans le groupe motopropulseur, donc c'est bon, mais rien d'autre ne l'est pas.)\n\n3. Ne conduisez pas sur des branches \u00e9pineuses. (Nous avions d\u00e9j\u00e0 un pneu perfor\u00e9 par quatre \u00e9pines \u00e0 la fois.)\n\n4. Nettoyer et huiler la cha\u00eene apr\u00e8s une utilisation intensive en tout terrain.\n\n5. Dites \u00e0 @matthias si vous remarquez des d\u00e9fauts.\n\n\n### 3.8. Obtenir de l'eau potable <a name=\"chap-3-8\"> </a>\n\nVous pouvez obtenir de l'eau potable de plusieurs sources dans la r\u00e9gion. Par pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence:\n\n* **Bien pr\u00e8s de la mosqu\u00e9e ([emplacement] (http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/essaouira-pois_193062#19/31.35703/-9.79744)).** Notre puits pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9. C'est plus loin que le puits Iskoha, mais la route est pav\u00e9e et le terrain est plat. Le puits est desservi depuis le ch\u00e2teau d'eau \u00e0 20 m de celui-ci, et il existe un m\u00e9canisme pour ajuster la pression de l'eau \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du ch\u00e2teau d'eau (dans la zone en bas). Donc, dans le cas o\u00f9 la pression du robinet est tr\u00e8s faible, il se peut que le r\u00e9glage de cette vanne soit incorrect. Il est normalement r\u00e9gl\u00e9 sur \"faible \u00e0 moyen\", peut-\u00eatre pour \u00e9viter une surconsommation d'eau :D\n\n* **Bien \u00e0 Iskoha ([emplacement](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/essaouira-pois_193062#19/31.33849/-9.77640)).** Il n'y a aucun signe de consommation d'alcool Il y avait de l'eau \u00e0 ce puits, mais nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s ici par un local quand le puits pr\u00e8s de l'\u00e9cole \u00e9tait sec.\n\n* **Bien pr\u00e8s de l'\u00e9cole ([emplacement] (http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/essaouira-pois_193062#19/31.35486/-9.77214)).** Desservi par un tr\u00e8s visible , grand ch\u00e2teau d'eau ca. 200 m de l\u00e0. Ce ch\u00e2teau d'eau dessert \u00e9galement tout le r\u00e9seau d'eau de cette partie du village, incluant probablement le puits d'Iskoha. Parce que ce puits s'est ass\u00e9ch\u00e9 peu de temps apr\u00e8s que le puits de l'\u00e9cole se soit ass\u00e9ch\u00e9, et qu'il y a des regards de service le long de la voie entre le ch\u00e2teau d'eau et le puits d'Iskoha, indiquant qu'il y a une canalisation d'eau.\n\n* **Boutiques \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki.** Les boutiques de gauche et du centre vendent de l'eau potable dans des bidons de 5 l. Les deux magasins ont les deux marques: le carr\u00e9 peut contenir 10 MAD pour 5 l, le bidon rond pour 12 MAD pour 5 l.\n\nTous les puits peuvent \u00eatre p\u00e9riodiquement secs / hors service. Dans ce cas, revenez au bout de quelques jours. L'eau du puits est l\u00e9g\u00e8rement sal\u00e9e, mais bien potable.\n\n\n## 4. Quitter la maison <a name=\"chap-4\"> </a>\n\n### 4.1. \u00c0 Sidi Kaouki <a name=\"chap-4-1\"> </a>\n\nIl existe plusieurs options de transport :D\n\n1. **En v\u00e9lo.** Vous pouvez prendre l'un de nos quatre v\u00e9los. Prenez la serrure et verrouillez la bicyclette dans le centre de Sidi Kaouki pendant que vous \u00eates \u00e0 Essaouira, Gazhoua, ou partez \u00e0 l'a\u00e9roport. La combinaison de verrouillage est `1632` (verrou rouge) et` 0008` (verrou noir).\n\n2. **En marchant.** Au centre (station de bus etc.) il faut environ 30 minutes de marche mod\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 rapide.\n\n3. **En faisant de l'autostop.** M\u00eame que dans la section \"De Sidi Kaouki\", [qui voit](#chap-1-1).\n\n4. **En minibus** Le bus passe quatre fois par jour \u00e0 la maison et passe du centre de Sidi Kaouki \u00e0 Essaouira. Pour les d\u00e9tails et son calendrier, voir la section \"[A Gazhoua et Essaouira](#chap-4-2)\".\n\n\n### 4.2. Pour Gazhoua et Essaouira <a name=\"chap-4-2\"> </a>\n\nPour tous les achats importants, nous devons aller \u00e0 Gazhoua (la plus petite ville la plus proche, a un grand supermarch\u00e9 et quelques magasins) ou \u00e0 Essaouira (plus grande ville la plus proche, environ 70.000 habitants).\n\nDe notre maison \u00e0 Essaouira vous avez les m\u00eames options de transport que [d'Essaouira \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki] (# chap-1-2). Ceux-ci s'appliquent \u00e9galement \u00e0 Gazhoua, qui se dirige vers Essaouira.\n\n1. **En bus.** D\u00e9part du [centre de Sidi Kaouki] (https://goo.gl/maps/CngRn3pFCzB2). L'horaire ci-dessous a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli en supposant un d\u00e9part de retour 40 minutes apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part d'Essaouira (peut-\u00eatre plus, mais mieux vaut-on p\u00e9cher par s\u00e9curit\u00e9):\n\n    * **08:00** (premier bus, confirm\u00e9 [ici] (https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17934404))\n    * **10:10** (d\u00e9part observ\u00e9 10h10 et 10h15)\n    * **12:10**\n    * **14:10**\n    * **16:10** (peut-\u00eatre)\n    * **17:10** (confirm\u00e9 [ici] (https://www.alongdustyroads.com/posts/2017/6/20/how-to-get-to-sidi-kaouki-from-essaouira) par un chauffeur de bus, \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 par nous le voir 17:35 \u00e0 Gazhoua)\n    * **18:10** (dernier bus selon un local, pas encore confirm\u00e9), d'apr\u00e8s cette source locale, le bus revient \u00e0 19h10 \u00e0 Sidi Kaouki mais reste ici la nuit, donc ce serait alors le dernier bus)\n\n2. **Par microbus.** Il existe deux types de microbus, chacun allant jusqu'\u00e0 quatre fois. On a un signe \"Sidi Mbarek\" au sommet de son pare-brise. Vous pouvez arr\u00eater ce bus juste en face de notre maison, car il passe l\u00e0. Horaire des bus \u00e0 notre domicile (supposons 5 minutes plus tard au centre de Sidi Kaouki et \u00b1 15 minutes de variation):\n\n    * **6:25**\n    * **7:25** (entre 7h00 et 7h30, selon Habiba)\n    * **9:25** (observ\u00e9 9h17, 9h48, 9h50)\n    * **14:00** (observ\u00e9 14:05)\n    * **15:00** (dernier bus, selon un local, mais cette information est probablement erron\u00e9e)\n    * **15:25**\n    * **16:45** (dernier bus, selon [cette source] (https://www.alongdustyroads.com/posts/2017/6/20/how-to-get-to-sidi-kaouki-from -essaouira))\n\n3. **Par grand taxi.** Ils partent du [centre de Sidi Kaouki] (https://goo.gl/maps/CngRn3pFCzB2). Tous les v\u00e9hicules bleu ciel et bleu avec un embl\u00e8me rond sur les portes d'entr\u00e9e sont de grands taxis, que ce soit des voitures Mercedes rouill\u00e9es ou de nouvelles camionnettes. Le prix est toujours 100 MAD pour le taxi vers Essaouira, qui est dit \u00eatre le taux officiel fix\u00e9 par la ville, ainsi il sera partag\u00e9 entre 1-6 passagers selon combien vous trouvez pour vous joindre. Pendant la saison touristique (\u00e0 partir d'avril), vous pouvez \u00e9galement trouver un syst\u00e8me diff\u00e9rent: le chauffeur de taxi facturera 15 MAD \u00e0 tous les passagers, et pariera \u00e0 prendre plus de passagers pour remplir la voiture (ce qui signifie 6 passagers, car c'est ce que tous les taxis sont autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 transporter, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur capacit\u00e9 de si\u00e8ge).\n\n    Le premier taxi n'est disponible qu'\u00e0 Sidi Kaouki apr\u00e8s que quelqu'un en ait pris un \u00e0 Essaouira. Dans la matin\u00e9e, nous avons observ\u00e9 _no_ taxis aux heures suivantes: 9h55. En outre, il n'y aurait pas de taxis dans la soir\u00e9e (tardive).\n\n\n### 4.3. \u00c0 l'a\u00e9roport d'Essaouira-Mogador <a name=\"chap-4-3\"> </a>\n\n_[FAIRE]_\n\n\n### 4.4. \u00c0 l'a\u00e9roport d'Agadir <a name=\"chap-4-4\"> </a>\n\n_[FAIRE]_\n\n\n### 4.5.

I agree that the Internet is not a Wild West, or at least not as it once was. This turn of phrase is admittedly a little bit of a rhetorical ploy Suzanne and I used. But I do feel that current oversight of infrastructural companies comes down to \"cowboy's honor\". \n\nWhereas the social media companies are subject to more serious oversight, these lower layer companies are subject to less scrutiny. Now, this is by no means to say that government oversight or regulation will improve this situation either. What we saw during the last US Congressional hearings at least, was that much of the debate was fueled by party-politics rather than asserting oversight. \n\nThat is not even to speak of a number of countries across the globe who use their power over various Internet companies (through licensing agreements or spectrum access) to make these companies the proxies for their terrible politics. \n\nI like your idea of human control. At the same time, I am worried about who will in effect have the time and other resources to - on top of jobs, families etc - dive into the nitty-gritty of controlling their own user experience at the level of CDNs. We already see that a negligible number of people fiddle with bits they can change. What percentage of people change the details of their DNS resolver? Who checks their CAs? Probably the same (white male) folks currently running companies like Cloudflare or participating in the IETF.\n\nI do not necessarily have a silver bullet. But I do think more can be done by way of regulation, that both forces the cowboys to follow some externally enforced accountability mechanisms without average users needing to become networking experts. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!", "created_at": "2020-08-22 19:31:08.467629", "updated_at": "2020-08-22 19:31:08.467629", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 309, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [82191], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72407, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 12966, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Here's a little update on the chloroquine situation, which has become much more messy since I last looked. There's a lot of hype right now. Trump mentioned it. Somebody heard it, [took chloroquine for fish and died](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/23/health/arizona-coronavirus-chloroquine-death/index.html). There are several studies underway of which we don't have the results. And so on.\n\nArticles I found helpful:\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/an-old-malaria-drug-may-fight-covid-19-and-silicon-valleys-into-it/\n\nThat one has a detailed overview of everything going on with the current chloroquine hype, and why there is reason to be careful.\n\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/covid-19-the-bitter-truth-about-using-hydroxychloroquine-as-a-preventive-drug-1659116-2020-03-24\n\nAnd this one is valuable because it tries to put into perspective the recommendation of Indian Council for Medical Research about high-risk groups using hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis. It does not fail to talk about the side effects and dangers of that medicine. I have to look more into into it, but it probably means that prophylaxis is not a good idea for anyone who can expect a light course of COVID-19.\n\nMy hope is still that chloroquine or the (less toxic) hydroxychloroquine will prove effective in treatment and chemoprophylaxis of COVID-19. That, or the same with other drugs, would certainly be the most comfortable way of going back to near-normal before vaccines arrive 12-18 months from now. We will find out in the next few weeks. Until then, please, nobody does anything dumb with any kind of chloroquine.

I have worked for different kinds of organisations (NGOs, Italian Development Agency, European Commission, private companies), and for the last 5 years I have been project manager and trainer/consultant for a consulting company, especially working in the area of training and skills development for the development and humanitarian community, with the European Commission being our main client.\n\nDevelopment cooperation, with all its flaws and contradictory features, is (or should be) fundamentally driven by the goal of fighting inequalities and eradicating poverty. However, after 70 years of international development cooperation, while some progresses have been achieved, it is evident that inequalities are still growing. \nThe age of the Internet has brought many new opportunities and challenges for the global fight for justice and equality. Technological advances have made knowledge, services and goods far more easily available to a bigger share of global population. However, the control over these resources is increasingly concentrated in the hands of few stakeholders (usually private corporations, and to a lesser extent public entities).\n\n\nDuring my university studies, I followed a course about the governance of the global communication and information systems, which raised my awareness about the intimate link between how technology is designed and how much the users are (or aren\u2019t) protagonists of the decision-making processes that impact their daily lives. \nFor example, I am currently involved in the design and development of an online training programme, funded by the European Commission, to develop the skills and awareness of volunteers engaging in solidarity actions in Europe. We are just starting, but it is already evident that accessibility for everyone is key for the success and usefulness of the programme, as it is the direct involvement of learners in shaping the e-learning contents and modalities.\n\n\nAnother example is the possibility to use geo-spatial data to provide humanitarian or development services with the direct involvement of beneficiaries. \nIn general, my curiosity is piqued by the possibility to develop technologies that can re-shape development policies and practices towards a needs-based approach instead of a donor-driven approach.\n\n\nBesides strictly development/humanitarian aspects, I am interested in the role of technology, AI, social networks and IT tools that can empower citizens and foster democracy in an increasingly complex global society.\n\nI look forward to joining the event and this community.", "created_at": "2019-10-28 22:34:40.861996", "updated_at": "2019-10-28 23:20:59.370778", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 440, "wiki": true, "reads": 5, "score": 36.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36842, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7171, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-09-23 01:52:21.498554", "updated_at": "2017-09-23 01:53:03.112166", "deleted_at": "2017-09-23 12:13:54.923450", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52391, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9689, "post_number": 7, "raw": "We didnt get a domain yet, do you have any advice wrt .eu versus .org? @natalia_skoczylas is looking into it and apparently the .org is easier to get,", "created_at": "2019-04-09 09:15:24.062989", "updated_at": "2019-04-09 09:15:24.062989", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [52340], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42634, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8155, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Very good to know, @janetgunter.

Once the card deck is complete (and also hopefully prior) we should begin to populate the wiki.\u00a0\n\nIt's a bit chicken and egg though right now, since we need the cards before we can produce each wiki page, as to avoid a duplication of efforts.\u00a0\n\nThat's all for now! \u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-02 12:43:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.440200", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 408, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24225, "user_id": 190, "topic_id": 1270, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>A more realistic proposal...</b>\n\nAlberto,\u00a0\n\nyes I have heard about David Graeber's book and have linked two discussions by Graeber at the end of my article. I acknowledge that Graeber is probably right in maintaining that the precursor of money was not barter but some credit system. It does not substantially change my argument that we should have some kind of money that is more flexible than what we have today, so I probably won't revise the article, at least not until I have had a chance of reading the actual book.\u00a0\n\nAlso, you should be aware that my proposal is not something that could be implemented at country or continent level. It is an invitation to get out of the rut of thinking that we have built up about money, and to consider that there might well be alternatives. I very much agree with the direction of the work of Eric and others in the alternative and local money area, that there are many transactions that can't be measured (and can't therefore be rewarded) in terms of today's money and that we therefore need a kind of system that can embrace those transactions.\u00a0\n\nFor something to stimulate thinking at the EU proposals level, I just came across a more realistic proposal. It is in a paper by Trond Andresen from Norway, titled\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b>What if the Greeks, Irish, Baltics, Spaniards, Italians did this:</b>\n\n<b>high-tech parallel monetary systems for the underdogs?</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.itk.ntnu.no/ansatte/Andresen_Trond/econ/greece-etc-2.pdf\">http://www.itk.ntnu.no/ansatte/Andresen_Trond/econ/greece-etc-2.pdf</a></b>\n\nTrond says that the availability of an alternate currency in the countries that are economically struggling would help maintain local economic activity which today is hampered by the lack of official Euro currency, and it would also eventually increase the chances of paying up on the debt, because a fluorishing economy has a better chance to catch up with payments than one that is suffering.\n\nTrond is concerned that authorities might act to try and stop such a currency, but if they actually initiated it or gave it their nod of agreement... who knows if it might not work wonders...\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-04 17:49:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.333415", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 473, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72280, "user_id": 3782, "topic_id": 12945, "post_number": 8, "raw": "We run two official calls per week (one Arabic and one English) we use Google Hangout since it is free. \n\nFor the community: i think it will be better to be hosted by your Zoom account. nothing else needed :D \ngeneral info:\nnu. of players from 5 to 14.\nDuration: from an hour and half to two hours (depend on the number of players)\n\nI will just need to know the number of the player before the call and their whataspp number (or any other proposed way) to send them privately their cards.", "created_at": "2020-03-24 09:50:07.458010", "updated_at": "2020-03-24 09:50:07.458010", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 93, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 49.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [72277], "is_liked_by": [4934, 6078], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52276, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9693, "post_number": 6, "raw": "FWIW, I am with @nadia on this one.", "created_at": "2019-04-04 08:51:00.195797", "updated_at": "2019-04-04 08:51:00.195797", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [52271], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65642, "user_id": 5915, "topic_id": 11882, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Tell us about yourself?

We were introduced to you guys by the Woodbine Hub in NYC. We wanted to introduce ourselves and hopefully get more involved with this epic OpenCare endeavor. We are eager to learn and share at the same time. \n\nBiosphere(x) is a group effort towards permanent culture[s]. A dedicated cadre of people with different histories and common visions, we strategize to leverage existing infrastructures, cutting edge research, obscure histories (from the point of view of our common mother cultures), and practical direct action in order to create new possibilities within the dominant one.\n\nWith a vision of a world that is better than we found it, we believe it\u2019s imperative to remember the root all problems are social, and they require social solutions to address. \n\nIn the past couple years, Biosphere(x) has focused in a couple of areas. In our physical practice of Permaculture design, we operate 3 separate sites where we have implement small scale holistic land management. Community food events are also weekly occurrences which range from fermentation parties, spice making, weekly meal preparations. We design and fabricate bespoke tools and structures both out of necessity and principle.  Each indoor aquaponics operation and mycelium cultivation system we build and operate provide us with insight for the next iteration.  One public facing service we offer through the engineering and fabrication wing of b(x), BxM, is building loft structures for friends and friends of friends. Many of the members of b(x) practice intentional physical movement as a reaction to modern sedentary expectations.  This has led to an emergence of weekly calisthenic exercise groups in the various parks of NYC, more focused movement clinics for interested non-Biosphere(x) peoples, and team practice of field tactics. With this non-exhaustive list of programs we aim to maintain a readiness to address uncertainties of the future, as well as stay rooted in the present. \n\nIt\u2019s evident to us that changes are predicated upon small consistent steps. Between every monthly public facing project are smaller daily practices and rituals. For every harvest there are many sowings, for every skill share there are numerous meal preps. It\u2019s not that we have discovered something new, but more an acknowledgement of the long now. It\u2019s our hope that as a group we will ultimately construct the reality we seek, and be able to be of service to other individuals and groups in a common struggle against industrial complexes and spiritual death. \n\nWe look forward to interacting with people on here leading up to the OpenCare event. Feel free to reach out to @liz_biospherex and I if you guys are in our neck of the woods.

In medicine there is an expectation of precision, but with so many biological variables, the more precise you get the more you diverge, so large scale information potentially becomes less valuable. For example, in the 1970s, various tools were introduced to help doctors predict the likelihood of certain diseases, but attempts to refine these profiles over the years have hit a barrier.

(cc @amelia )\n[/quote]\n\nIndeed, and this is what we do in NGI and Babel (and what I do in POPREBEL). But @Jan and @Wojt like to assign their codes first and then check that they mean the same things as the other ethnographers, and then do the merge if that is true (rather than checking the codebook while coding before assigning the code). Later down the line, when it's easy to see both the codes and definitions on the platform while coding, there will be no question that we all check for definitional alignment at the time of code assignment. At the moment, that adds a lot of time, so I'm ok with them doing it the other way and then merging their codes when they check and confirm that they mean the same thing as the other ethnographers. All have committed to being stringent about this merging and doing it regularly -- we have a large-scale merging exercise on Thursday to get on the same page, and will make the merging process firm. \n\nI identified that the process you describe (the selection of other people's codes while coding) was happening on a call with Wojciech rather than anything 'automagic' and explained it to him, but he also thought there was an actual 'automagic' process going on prior to his setting his user settings to the ethno poprebel tag --- @Wojt can you confirm and describe, please, if this is still happening?\n\nOtherwise, I agree with @matthias re your old codes --- it's ideal that they become merged anyway, once we know we mean the same thing, so we need to come up with a process for this (them joining the group codes) which doesn't make you feel like you've lost them. The ideal is that we work toward a shared codebook, not siloed ones, and this should be much easier now that we can filter the codes by ethno poprebel tag.", "created_at": "2020-08-04 16:31:27.161736", "updated_at": "2020-08-04 16:33:22.188061", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 358, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 16.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [81345], "is_reply_to": [81345], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18996, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3992, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>sysadmins, step forward :)</b>\n\nBut sure, if somebody wants to share sysadmin tasks, welcome to step forward.
