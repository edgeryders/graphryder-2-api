Yet, the relationship between the utility (U) consumers gain and the data (D) they supply \u2014 \u201creturn on data\u201d (ROD) \u2014 remains largely unexplored. Expressed as a ratio, ROD = U / D. While lawmakers strongly advocate protecting consumer privacy, they tend to overlook ROD. Are the benefits of the services enjoyed by consumers, such as social networking and predictive search, commensurate with the value of the data extracted from them? How can consumers compare competing data-for-services deals? Currently, the legal frameworks regulating these transactions, including privacy law, aim primarily to protect personal data. They treat data protection as a standalone issue, distinct from the benefits which consumers receive. This article suggests that privacy concerns should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of ROD. Just as companies can quantify return on investment (ROI) to optimize investment decisions, consumers should be able to assess ROD in order to better spend and invest personal data. Making data-for-services transactions more transparent will enable consumers to evaluate the merits of these deals, negotiate their terms and make more informed decisions. Pivoting from the privacy paradigm to ROD will both incentivize data-driven service providers to offer consumers higher ROD, as well as create opportunities for new market entrants.\"\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n            \n            \n            \n                personal data\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                trade-off\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                usefulness\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                business model\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                privacy\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                \"return on data\"\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                digital services\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                attributing value\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                information quality\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                decision-making\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                contextualisation\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                informed choices\n            \n        \n        \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2020-09-11 10:02:58.084842", "updated_at": "2020-09-11 10:50:18.968924", "tag_id": 4773, "post_id": 55206, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9821}, {"id": 23882, "text": "", "quote": "What do digital services in a world of net-zero look like ?", "created_at": "2020-09-11 10:02:58.087426", "updated_at": "2020-09-11 10:50:18.974052", "tag_id": 4773, "post_id": 61010, "creator_id": 5209, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 11070}, {"id": 23913, "text": "", "quote": "I remember I once put together an idea collection / design outline for a \"village grid\" system for Nepal.

Yet, the relationship between the utility (U) consumers gain and the data (D) they supply \u2014 \u201creturn on data\u201d (ROD) \u2014 remains largely unexplored. Expressed as a ratio, ROD = U / D. While lawmakers strongly advocate protecting consumer privacy, they tend to overlook ROD. Are the benefits of the services enjoyed by consumers, such as social networking and predictive search, commensurate with the value of the data extracted from them? How can consumers compare competing data-for-services deals? Currently, the legal frameworks regulating these transactions, including privacy law, aim primarily to protect personal data. They treat data protection as a standalone issue, distinct from the benefits which consumers receive. This article suggests that privacy concerns should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of ROD. Just as companies can quantify return on investment (ROI) to optimize investment decisions, consumers should be able to assess ROD in order to better spend and invest personal data. Making data-for-services transactions more transparent will enable consumers to evaluate the merits of these deals, negotiate their terms and make more informed decisions. Pivoting from the privacy paradigm to ROD will both incentivize data-driven service providers to offer consumers higher ROD, as well as create opportunities for new market entrants.\"\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n            \n            \n            \n                personal data\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                trade-off\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                usefulness\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                business model\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                privacy\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                \"return on data\"\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                digital services\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                attributing value\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                information quality\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                decision-making\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                contextualisation\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                informed choices\n            \n        \n        \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2020-09-03 10:25:04.170541", "updated_at": "2020-09-23 15:42:58.908576", "tag_id": 5891, "post_id": 55206, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9821}, {"id": 24708, "text": "", "quote": "will experience many of the same problems with generating demand, usage as well as the challenges facing the volunteers managing these facilities", "created_at": "2020-09-23 16:26:43.076583", "updated_at": "2020-09-23 16:26:51.967209", "tag_id": 6212, "post_id": 80422, "creator_id": 5479, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 14066}, {"id": 24572, "text": "", "quote": "I like the concept.

I left my hometown 14 years ago and I have been reconstructing my social world since then. I think the 'home bubbles' and the 'abroad bubbles' have always been fluid for me - 'home' and 'abroad' have blurry boundaries. Even in my darkest, least hopeful moments, when it felt like I didn't have a home anymore or a language that feels like home, I tried to remind myself that I left Romania for NYC because I was curious to learn about the world. This is also the reason for which I try to keep my bubbles porous - I believe that if I want to learn with others I cannot live in the comfort of a cozy space. My struggle has been to deconstruct ideas that society takes for granted - that 'home' needs to be a stable space, a comfortable one, a space of predictability and intimacy (hence my interest in co-housing). But most homes are not like that or, more accurately, they are like that only in the simplified narratives we create about them. From my experience, there is a lot of hard work involved in building a home both 'at home' and 'abroad'. So, it is this hard work of making a home that keeps me sane because I know that, if I am honest with myself, wherever I go I will have to engage in it. This realization has saved me from cultural shocks and the disappointment with old or new friends. Of course, some days it feels easier to fall back on given narratives about homes and homelands...but those days pass. More difficult is losing friends because of such relocations in space but then again friendships are dialogues and some dialogues end or morph into something else. I guess, I find my wellbeing in trying to stay curious, kind and open to the world around me even when I don't feel like it or when the world around doesn't seem particularly kind to me (poetry helps too) :)\n        \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2020-09-23 20:11:47.199592", "updated_at": "2020-09-23 20:12:09.206684", "tag_id": 963, "post_id": 64081, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9369}, {"id": 11370, "text": null, "quote": "War is like a dirty toilet that no one wants to clean someone said...\nViolence begets violence and war is the\u00a0ugliest\u00a0human invention.

Show the world how Turkey has vowed to support Azerbaijan till the end. Remind them of our history and tell them our story. Our story through the millennia. Our story of struggle and survival and for our right to have our place on this fragile planet.\" Maria Titizyan\n\"The timing of these events should not be a surprise. Azerbaijan's economy is in terrible shape right now. Their currency dropped 40% in value against the dollar in January. Their entire economy is almost completely tied to oil and oil prices are at the lowest point in a decade. Mass protests against corruption and a depressed economy in Azerbaijan have increased in recent months. Invading Nagorno-Karabagh is an attempt to boost nationalism and act as a distraction from real problems at home. All that plus Russia's deteriorating relationship with Turkey, a strong political ally of Azerbaijan, creates a terrible condition for Azerbajian to act aggressively against Nagorno-Karabakh.\" \u00a0Erik Yesayan\n\"Armed with the knowledge of the history of this conflict, it is easy to discern that it is not in Artsakh\u2019s interests to break the peace and renew hostilities. Instead, it is Azerbaijan that wishes to retake control of land which, due to the political maneuvering of a third higher power, temporarily fell into its hands but over which it has no legitimate claim.\" Aram Hovasapyan\nRight now both sides agreed on a temporary ceasefire\u00a0while Armenia's president is meeting OSCE in Vienna and Azeri PM is in\u00a0Iran to attend a meeting with\u00a0foreign ministers of Iran\u00a0and Turkey...hope this will de-escalate sooner than later...\nAdditional reading:\nhttps://goo.gl/ci3lFU\nhttp://goo.gl/x4XTSJ\nhttp://goo.gl/j6jqUe\nhttp://goo.gl/1jv07R", "created_at": "2017-04-15 19:53:49", "updated_at": "2017-04-15 19:53:49", "tag_id": 1823, "post_id": 33738, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6587}, {"id": 24632, "text": "", "quote": "Today, the discourse around Smart Cities is largely dominated by the vendors of smart city tech: The debate is using their language, the framing of possible solutions matches their products.

It remained complex and ambitious \u00ad and it\u2019s important to keep it that way. The organization managed to raise money from private sources to buy and renovate a building in Brussels (in fact we are still short of renovation money, and we are looking for 500.000 to get the job done). The space is so huge (650 square meters) that we can both offer support to many homeless people and invite other organizations working on the topic to use it. There is another reason why we made it so big \u00ad if the place was small and crowded with homeless from, say, Morocco, a Belgian single homeless person wouldn\u2019t enter, even if we offered what they needed. It would just feel overwhelming.\nThe mission of DoucheFLUX is to promote self\u00ad-esteem and help homeless people regain a positive image of themselves. The activities we propose do not make them feel intimidated. We forbade the usage of the words such as \"culture\" or \"art\" in the space, as well. Together with these precarious people, we produce a magazine, that is published 4\u00ad5 times a year. We also release a monthly broadcast, organize meetings in schools and film debates. Recently, we\u2019ve been busy designing a board game that allows regular people to understand and experience the hardships and challenges of homelessness. The idea wasn\u2019t mine \u00ad one of the homeless people proposed it as a way to engage with passers\u00adby. We are preparing the beta version to be ready for the Brussels Game Festival.\u2028After the opening of the building, which should happen by the end of the year, we will finally extend our services beyond going to the streets and establishing relations with the homeless. We will have 20 showers \u00ad 7 for women, 12 for men, and one for people on wheelchair. There will be also medical area and daily medical staff which our guests can appoint. This simple thing will hopefully fix once and for all the problem with access to showers in Brussels. We\u2019re in the capital of Europe, but for people on the street there is only La Fontaine, which provides one shower per person a week, and you even have to be lucky to get it.\nObviously, if we have showers, we need to have laundry. And the lockers. A huge problem among this community: there are virtually no lockers in Brussels, therefore people constantly get robbed and lose their things. As a result, they end up in a vicious circle of bureaucracy to get back whatever papers and permissions they need, and incredible insecurity. We will have 400 lockers, from super small for medicine and documents, to bigger ones.\nAnd finally, we would like to open a help desk at DoucheFlux one day. Which means we don\u2019t want to become the only organization covering all their needs \u00ad but to provide them with information on where they could be offered help with other problems. We want this to be accompanied by the first centralized website, simple and intuitive so that people who don\u2019t speak French or Flemish will be able to navigate it. It\u2019s incredible how untransparent Brussels is to these people \u00ad they have no idea where to find a lawyer, where to sleep, eat, get their medicine or find work. This idea is supported by everyone from the field in the city.\nWe are also facing some challenges around financing (we think we have reached the limits of private donations in the country at this point) and we consider turning the space into a public-\u00adprivate entity. Our bargaining chip is all our achievement \u00ad we hope the formal institutions will see it as a necessity to support an initiative that has gone so far on its own. We have 50 volunteers, we employ and pay only one person (we want to extend it to at least 2\u00ad3), and all that without a single euro from the state. I\u2019m optimistic about it \u00ad I don\u2019t think anyone would like to see us closed at that point.\nWould you like to share you experience with work with vulnerable social groups?

But I also remember when I worked for a big media company that the notion of that kind of restraint to the advertising-heavy establishment that employed me, seemed kind of absurd because why would you restrain yourself from going after the most money you can make?\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n            \n            \n            \n                commercialisation\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                profiting\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                advertising\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                Internet\n            \n        \n        \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2020-09-01 08:33:45.802612", "updated_at": "2020-09-24 13:29:08.395069", "tag_id": 5327, "post_id": 58405, "creator_id": 5479, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10017}, {"id": 24651, "text": "", "quote": "Since cohousing and coliving rely on a healthy community this is the way to go: provide space and invite people to join who are willing to contribute to a fun, open, connected experience.
