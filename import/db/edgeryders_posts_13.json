We outline below the main processes and tools which will be used, and encourage everyone to adopt them to build a thriving online community.\n\n\n## Content\n\n**[1.

How to support social media engagement](#heading--5-5)\n\n----\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. Who is the Wellbeing in Europe community?</h2>\n\nEveryone who is registered on edgeryders.eu and has contributed to the discussions in &ldquo;Wellbeing in Europe&rdquo;, or broadly on Edgeryders.eu. We do not make any distinction based on age, gender, race, nationality, social or economic status, and we don&rsquo;t specifically collect this type of personal data.\n\nWe also use the term community more generally, to include those who have been yet to be reached, influenced, or supported through the project.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Team as a funnel</h2>\n\nAll team members are spokespeople for the project, therefore we become entry points into the community. We will find ourselves in situations where we tell other people about the platform, we present at conferences, we share content on social media, mailing lists and in other networks, and so on. The ways to direct someone to the Community are:\n\n* Invite them to the Wellbeing in Europe forum - in Czech, English, Polish, Serbian/Croatian.\n* Share a direct link to an interesting story and encourage them to leave a thoughtful reply.\n* Invite them to register for a Virtual Cafe and meet others\n* Share a direct link to How To Participate page, with an overview of most opportunities offered by the project\n* Invite them to sign up on the #CountOnMe mailing list and receive a curated list of headline stories from the community (by email).\n\nThe project will be different things to different people - it will be general i.e. a way to come together around new solutions to current problems; or specific i.e. an opportunity to access specig. And so on. It's in our best collective interest to gauge what someone could be interested in and point them to relevant information.\n\nIf there isn't relevant information available online, don't wait! Go ahead and create Add Topic asking what&rsquo;s on your mind. The more specific you are, the easier it will be for (other) team members to support you.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Languages</h2>\n\nAll the official project descriptions and calls for participation will be written in all of the project&rsquo;s official languages: Czech, English, Polish, Serbian/Croatian. Community contributions can be in any of these languages, and interactions can happen simultaneously in more than one language.\n\nWe are actively promoting all and any language use, we use Euro-English as a default. We ask members to contribute in the language they are most comfortable with. If they read content in a foreign language, we encourage them to use web translation if necessary, because the community platform does not provide automated translation.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Badges (DISCARDED)</h2>\n\n![|624x184](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SY-P8bwtxGXsk6JUD9gjyH2Iqql9C7_sSAyfMxBcCyc1ic93h2haEhhoqa80TnUzM16wycMwqxZnW9PUcTPlekPS2THreyHzgXNNyjE6tyBohwEQ4NvWK8l9DWqyLouT-3dliFag)\n\nBadges are digital tokens that reinforce positive user behaviour and facilitate &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo;. They are a central part of Discourse&rsquo;s gamification features, the platform technology on which Wellbeing in Europe conversation is hosted.\n\nA community building project as much as a research project, Wellbeing in Europe aims to engage participants to contribute their experiences and join a common conversation with peers from all over. In all our activities we support participants to develop key collaboration skills and take on key roles. The most important roles are: story contributors, topic experts, and local connectors. Each key role consists of participants achieving a set of results. Once the results are achieved, a corresponding badge is awarded to the user to keep track of their contributions and set a good example for others.\n\nUnlike automatic badges awarded on edgeryders.eu (example [1](https://edgeryders.eu/badges/11/first-like) and [2](https://edgeryders.eu/badges/39/empathetic)), Wellbeing in Europe Badges will be awarded by site administrators based on the contributions of members who respond to specific calls for participation inviting people to cover these roles. Each call will specify what role / what badge is at stake. Badges are non-transferable between users.\n\nHere are the key badges we are offering on an ongoing basis to participants on the online forum as a way to acknowledge contributions https://edgeryders.eu/badges (look under Wellbeing in Europe).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Weekly Community Management Activities</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-1\">5.1. How to welcome new members</h3>\n\nAll who are registered on edgeryders.eu become community members and consent to the research, through a consent form visible at signup. They are also subject to our [official user, privacy and content licensing policy](https://edgeryders.eu/t/terms-of-use-and-privacy-policy/44). @Noemi, @Maja, @Jirka_Kocian, @natalia_skoczylas are primarily in charge of welcoming most users after sign up.\n\nHere's how we do it: We check for [new users](https://edgeryders.eu/t/new-members-on-edgeryders-eu/9471/2381) and [new topics](/c/wellbeing) every day (<a title=\"Even if we are not sure that new users have joined for Wellbeing in Europe (perhaps they just heard about Edgeryders), we will welcome them and tell them about the project anyway.\">details</a> :speech_balloon:). \n**We get in touch in private message** (click on a user's public profile and then on <kbd>Message</kbd>) or **in a reply to a topic a user has posted.** Remember: no topic left without a comment! While at it, we make ourselves available to answer questions about using the platform and the project Wellbeing in Europe.\n\nTo make your work easier, you can [subscribe to a category](/t/-/6463#heading--2-7) to be notified about new topics in it, and you can subscribe to [be notified about new user signups](/t/-/6647#heading--4-1).\n\n\n#### Example Welcome Message 1 (Good to follow when no information is available on user profile)\n\n[quote]\nHei hei, welcome on board! Happy you are joining edgeryders,\nAs a longtimer and one of the community managers here, I'll try to be of help and point you to where the most interesting things are happening right now.\n\nThe easiest is to start by sharing your personal story or work so that we can connect you with others who can support you with advice and tell you about similar experiences. We have some key topics right now, and feel free to write in your preferred language.\n\n1. How are you accessing health and social care?\n2. How do you manage to stay morally and psychologically well?\n3. How do you access work and prosperity?\n\nFor all these, you can add New Topics [in English and other languages](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing/eu), [in Polish](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing/pl), [in Czech](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing/cz).\nYour story qualifies you to be eligible for a financial, symbolic reward of [200 eur](https://edgeryders.eu/t/show-us-stories-that-matter-become-an-expert-in-a-topic-and-get-paid-200/9823), as well as to be invited to workshops around Europe starting summer. \n\n4. How are you or others you know make the Internet and our digital technologies better? \n[In English and any other languages you prefer](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/tell-your-story)\nYour story qualifies you to get invites to Internet of Human events we will be hosting later this year.\n\n5. Come talk to the team directly by registering for a weekly Virtual Cafe - we run them Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, in different languages. Check [our facebook events](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Edgeryders/events/) and sign up!\n\nHoping this makes sense and you enjoy the ryde!\nSee you on the forum,\n\nNoemi\n\n[/quote]\n\n\n#### Example Welcome Message 2 (when some information is available on user profile/ in the topic posted by the user)\n\n[quote]\nHello _[@name]_, I'm _[@name]_, an _[profession]_ living in _[country]_ and glad to see you have joined us in here, in this community.\n\nSome of us are involved in an ongoing conversation about our lives: what it means to work in our country, how we access health and care, and even what is spirituality in our life. It's unique because everyone speaks from their experience.. Would you be interested to share a little bit about yourself in any topic which preoccupies you at the moment?\n\nYou can introduce yourself here in a [New Topic here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing), or just browse through the existing stories and don't hesitate to post a comment. The latest story I was reading and found amazing is _[link to story]_!!!\n\nEnjoy, and if you'd like to meet the team and others live, join us for the weekly Virtual Cafes - [pick an event and register,](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Edgeryders/events/) we'll send you the link after. If you have questions, also ask them in a new topic on the platform, me or others in the community will jump in to answer them.\n[/quote]\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-2\">5.2. How to optimize stories (New Topics) created by members</h3>\n\nOnce a story has been posted in your country forum, we would like to make it findable by others and make sure that those who read it are also encouraged to post their own. For this, find the Edit button at the bottom, click on it and in the editor do the following:\n\n* Add relevant tags in the language of the story. Examples of tags to choose from are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r7XMK9XD-ejGQomMTmYB0YCH2MXkSkGRLhIScw-dSsY/edit#gid=612110968).\n* At the bottom of the text Insert the banner image calling other people to share their story too.\n\n_Image in EN_\n_Image in CZ_\n_Image in PL_\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-3\">5.3. How to prepare, host and document Virtual Caf\u00e9s</h3>\n\nThese are weekly online gatherings: \n* carefully facilitated by the community manager and documented (preferably this role is extended from community managers to participants). \n* in multiple formats: the calls vary in what they each are for those participating: sometimes they are an introduction to the project, or opportunity for participants to find out more about the ongoing calls for participation; other times they will announce an agenda - introduce a good community story and will have as guests the community members who can interact live with others; other times they will be the place where the work to build local events is coordinated (after we recruited local connectors -see below)\n* an opportunity for discovering new stories! if participants are not yet registered on [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/) and if they show good insights, community managers invite them for a one-on-one chat later which will be meant as an informal interview where (a) community managers ask questions and take notes (or record it); (b) help write the story in 1st person; (c) check with participants if it is accurate and can be posted under their name; if needed, we create accounts for them, and they can log in after and change their password; That way, we support people who are just coming into contact with the project to share their story on the platform and answer questions to their story in the comments.\n\nThe gatherings are hosted on Zoom - an easy to use communication platform and suited to our needs because:\n\n* It allows people to respond to our invitation ahead of time, by leaving an email address and name and making it possible to stay in touch before and after the meeting\n* Requires minimal installation effort: when people click the meeting link to join, it prompts them to install Zoom video meetings on their computer\n* It hosts more than the maximum 10 people allowed on google hangouts or skype (thanks to our edgeryders annual subscription)\n* It allows audio, video, chat, screen sharing and moderator options\n\nAll Caf\u00e9s happen weekly, in the same weekday and at the same time:\n\n* Czech call THURSDAYS 6 PM CEST --- Registration page: http://bit.ly/2uw3KPy\n\n* Polish call MONDAYS 6 PM CEST --- Registration page: http://bit.ly/2Wto3sN\n\n* Serbian call XXXXXXXXX --- Registration page: http://bit.ly/2TEEfFM\n\n* English language call WEDNESDAYS 6 PM CEST --- Registration page: http://bit.ly/2V0ldLI\n\n\n#### What to do before the Cafe\n\nEach language Caf\u00e9 has its own unique registration link to be sent with the invitation to all possible participants. They are also advertised as [Facebook events recurring](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Edgeryders/events/), with link to Zoom registration page. The page ask people to register for preferred dates, and leave their email and address. Community managers are automatically notified on email every time a new participant registers.\n\nA day before the Caf\u00e9, make sure to send everyone who registered the following message:\n\n[quote]\n**Hello xxx,**\n\nA warm welcome from me! I'm Noemi, community manager at edgeryders and one of the co-founders.\n\nThanks for registering! A reminder, the link to join on Wednesday at 18:00 PM CEST is: https://zoom.us/s/406268838\n\nSee you!\n\n**What you should know and do before we meet**\n\nThe weekly Cafes are the easiest way to learn about our global community, about how you can get involved and connect with people. Our focus project now is Wellbeing in Europe, a community action research where people from all over Europe and beyond share their stories so we can all learn and make progress in our projects. We also organise workshops and match-making events to connect and directly support most active online participants. Perhaps before tomorrow you can introduce yourselves by answering one of these three topics:\n\n[1) how do you get health and social care support?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-do-we-get-health-and-social-care-support/9665)\n\n[2) how are you accessing work and prosperity?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-do-we-access-work-and-prosperity/9664)\n\n[3) how do you manage to stay well psychologically and morally? do you practice spirituality?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-can-we-be-morally-and-psychologically-well/9666)\n[/quote]\n\nOR\n\n[quote]\nDear all,\n\nMy name is _name_ and I am happy to be hosting the Virtual Caf\u00e9,\n\nDuring the call, you will learn more about our community and opportunities to get involved and access resources, you will be able to share a story or a project, and together we will figure out how we can best support each other in our path to wellbeing.\n\nThis is the link where you can join: _[insert link here]_\nYou might be required to install zoom meetings, but that should be very easy!\n\nLooking forward to see you tomorrow!\n[/quote]\n\n\n#### How to facilitate during the Cafe\n\nAt the beginning of the call, ask someone to volunteer and take notes as people speak.\n\nIntroduce yourself as facilitator and what you personally hope to achieve during the call.\n\nPropose that each person present takes 1 minute to introduce themselves and tell others why they are here.\n\nAfter the introductions, ask questions about the stories you hear and try to connect them to others you know about from the platform.\n\nPropose to all present to sign up with an account on http://communities.edgeryders.eu and join Wellbeing in Europe by sharing their story. Explain how sharing will make it easier for us to find ways to support them (they will be eligible for paid roles in the project - Storyteller; Local Connector; Topic Expert) and to connect them to the events happening in the project.\n\nMake sure everyone gets a chance to speak.\n\nAt the end, remind participants that the conversation continues in the forum and in the next week&rsquo;s Caf\u00e9.\n\n\n#### How to document after the Cafe\n\nA volunteer notes as much as possible from what the others are saying, and makes sure to attribute content to people (who said what). After the call is over, the volunteer is helped to post the notes in the [project space](/c/wellbeing), namely in the country sub-category or any which you find relevant, by clicking on <kbd>+Add Topic</kbd>.\n\nExample:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/community-call-2017-12-13-brainstorming-a-new-media-platform/7853/7\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-4\">5.4. How to write a Community Status Update</h3>\n\nEach week, each community manager produces a new post (topic) in which they synthesize important information as a way to make it easier for members, new people, the rest of the team to follow the conversation. The post doesn&rsquo;t have to be long, 2-3 paragraphs are good.\n\nPossible contents of the status update:\n\n* Who are new community members who have joined recently? Welcome them warmly (and remember to draw their attention by pinging @username).\n* Tell us which are the new stories which you find inspiring and why? If there aren&rsquo;t new stories, tell us about an article or project you read in your country or in Europe which is inspiring, and why.\n* Announce a special guest in the next week&rsquo;s Virtual Caf\u00e9 and invite other people to join to meet this person.\n* Announce news from the project team and let community members know what are the opportunities for them - &ldquo;apply for the call for local connectors!&rdquo;.\n\nExample:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/meet-the-op3n-fellows-community-clinics-medical-drugs-manufacturing-digital-griefing-and-more/5914\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-5\">5.5. How to support social media engagement</h3>\n\n1. Please share the status updates you like from the [Edgeryders Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Edgeryders) and [twitter account](https://twitter.com/edgeryders) via your own profiles.\n2.

This can be used to manually convert topics to PDF ([details in our manual](https://edgeryders.eu/t/discourse-user-manual-for-edgeryders-eu/6463#heading--5-4)). But it also provides a fast way to get HTML for a topic, to then convert to PDF the way Owen is doing it now.\n\nSince this is fast, creating a single PDF document from up to approx. 10 Discourse topics would also be reasonably fast, but beyond that we'd need a more robust implementation, and time to plan and do that as @hugi says.", "created_at": "2020-12-16 02:51:51.694160", "updated_at": "2020-12-16 02:52:18.712338", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 206, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 11.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [88990], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80297, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14068, "post_number": 5, "raw": "but we do need the questions to get the conversations going - can you add a comment with a question here like what I did for Nacho?", "created_at": "2020-07-13 08:18:07.779785", "updated_at": "2020-07-13 08:18:07.779785", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [80296], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25891, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1135, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>Making a living?</b>\n\nMarius,\n\nIn my understanding the guide would be less a repository and dictionary\u00a0of initiatives, rather practical\u00a0information, insights and\u00a0instructibles\u00a0that are clear,\u00a0easily legible, and\u00a0can inspire others,\u00a0support those\u00a0who are re-negotiating their relationship with the value of work. <span>Making a living has been a crucial point of conversation between Edgeryders for the past year.</span>The context is the dated\u00a0paradigm\u00a0asserting\u00a0jobs for life, ascending careers, enough jobs for everyone, smooth transition from\u00a0university into a labour market, so we'd\u00a0try\u00a0to provide better answers to questions like how we\u00a0go about:\n\n1. paying the rent\n\n2. influencing\u00a0who you are in the eyes of others\n\n3. finding reasons to get out of bed \u00a0(<a href=\"/blog/the-regeneration-of-meaning\">reference in this post and comments</a>)\n\nI think the audience is as large as it gets: say,\u00a0even proeficient users of p2p technology would still have something to learn from a re-ruralizing\u00a0experience of a different kind of peer support;\u00a0someone who is indeed trapped in a meaningless job might find the courage to adopt other solutions, as radical as they may appear.\u00a0\n\nReferring to your 3rd point, cross polinating ideas with others working on this is crucial, and I think it is not a coincidence that Edgeryders members are also Oui Share or Shareable enthusiasts, and viceversa.. the idea is to build on initiatives out there, and of course not be redundant.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-04-23 14:17:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.918693", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 314, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25800], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53426, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9875, "post_number": 8, "raw": "I also translated the introduction text in the Czech subcategory, check if it makes sense?

Mogu podjeliti sa tobom neka iskustva posto sam puno putovao i zivio u vise drzava.\nSto se prostitucije u Belgiji tice ona je legalizovana, to donosi nekoliko dobrih stvari:\n1. Zene koje tako rade imaju vise zastite od strane policije itd (mada su naravno kriminalne organizacije jos uvijek jake i cine mnoga zla)\n2. Zene koje tako rade imaju redovne testove za spolno prenosive bolesti, sto stiti vise i njih i njihove klijente\n3. Doprinose drustvu kroz placanje poreza i imaju svu zastitu koju bilo koji radnik ima, takodje imaju i penziju itd cini mi se\n\nMoj glavni argument za legalizaciju je to da u zemljama gdje je prostitucija ilegalna, prostitucija jos uvijek cvijeta posto je velika potraznja za njom ali sve ove stvari iznad ne postoje. Te zene su maltretirane, ubijane i jako cesto bukvalno robinje...kupljene i prodane tako.\n\nSto se tice razloga dacu ti neke koje znam:\nU Maroku na primjer tu zavrse cesto djevojke koje su odbacene od strane njihove porodice i s obzirom da im je drustvo patrijarhalno i one budu odbacene od drustva, te zene ne mogu cesto ni preziviti ako ne udju u prostituciju. To rade i djevojke iz bogatih familija koje zele uzbudjenje, zabavu, zele raditi zabranjene stvari.\nU Njemackoj i Belgiji ima puno zena koje to rade dobrovoljno i na specifican nacin. Na primjer u Njemackoj postoje neke vrste SPA centara gdje se placa ulaz na dnevnoj bazi a zene i muskarci se spontano skontaju i ako se zeni svidi, ona spava sa njim uz novcanu nadoknadu. Tako nesto, citao sam clanak o tome tako da nisam siguran. Cesto su to I u Belgiji i u Njemackoj samohrane majke ili studentice kojima treba nesto ekstra novaca mjesecno i onda periodicno, po potrebi, se bave prostitucijom.\nU Tajlandu na primjer majka je spremna prodati cerku da bi dobila novcanu nadoknadu na zalost...to je zajednicno za prostituciju u svim zemljama. Razlog broj jedan su finansijske teskoce ljudi. Ljudi takodjer cesto ne vide izlaza iz odredjene situacije. Osobe koje su odrasle u centrima prostitucije kao Marakes u Maroku, to vide prisutno u svom okruzenju. Znaci to im se cini kao ocigledan nacin izlaza iz teske situacije, pitanje je percepcije. Postoje mnogi drugi nacini da se prezivi ali stvarnost svake osobe zavisi od njene percepcije.\n\nJos jedan razlog (a to se cesto radi u zemljama istocne Evrope) jeste da se mladim djevojkama obeca posao u zapadnim zemljama. Te djevojke dodju, uzme im se pasos i uz pretnje, tucu i ostale stvari, natjeraju ih da ostanu i rade kao prostitutke...upadnu u lanac bjelog roblja i tesko se jako mogu izvuci.\n\nKao sto vidis postoje mnogi razlozi, ja pretpostavljam da u elitnoj prostituciji ima puno vise djevojki koje to  rade dobrovoljno. To je vec drugi problem. To je problem postavljanja vrednosti u zivotu i prioriteta, opet percepcija stvarnosti svake osobe diktira njeno ponasanje.\n\nSto se mene tice ne osudjujem nikoga, meni je samo vazno da imam pozitivnu interakciju sa drugim ljudskim bicima.", "created_at": "2019-07-27 09:14:09.007390", "updated_at": "2019-07-27 09:14:09.007390", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 519, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 57.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4986, 3, 5673], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58021, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 10148, "post_number": 11, "raw": "It sounds like you didn't hear anyone explain the science properly, so far :) Admittedly the people who can do that are rare.

However I'll say that most of software for infrastructure is available opensources and the real difficulty is about hardware and skilled people.\n\nMoreover I'm aware of a tunisian governement project to set up a national cloud to mutualize investments.

However, to the best of my knowledge, this work is largely done. The essential reading is Adam Greenfield's pamphlet *Against the smart city* ([review](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2013/12/02/city-cynic-against-the-smart-city-by-adam-greenfield-review/)). I *strongly* recommend reading it; walking into a meeting with city planners or urbanists without having read it risks marking you as an amateur.\n\nHere's why: the intellectual debate on the smart city is over. And the verdict is: it is not an intellectually responsible concept. It *never* was \u2013 even I, a lowly economist, knew this \u2013 because it flies in the face of the super solid city planning wisdom spelled out by Jane Jacobs in *[The death and life of great American cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs#The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities)* in 1961 (!) and adopted by the academic urban planning community ever since. Greenfield, however, did the work of going through the documents, and unmasking the smart city for what it always was: a tech vendor-driven effort to sell expensive, brittle, overspecified technology, based on early 20th century, discredited modernist ideology.\n\nThis is not to say the *actual issue* of smart cities is dead, nor that you are wasting your time looking into it. Tech vendors (IBM, Cisco, Siemens...) are powerful enough to keep this zombie idea shambling around. I do not see them taking hold, but they could still do quite some damage in places like Toronto. \n\n\n[quote=\"pbihr, post:1, topic:12721\"]\nAt the surface, the points mentioned above might imply that I argue against smart cities. I think there are real opportunities here: For sustainability, for participation, for government service delivery.\n[/quote]\n\nNot sure... I guess a skilled politician could try to turn the table, shifting the discussion away from the kind of tech that vendors want taxpayers to buy and onto social mechanism that encourage active citizenship and participation. But that's tricky, because everything that makes sense tends to decrease GDP (which is a bogus measure, but still widely used). In the past, I argued for an opportunistic redefinition of \"smart city\" in the participatory, open, human-powered sense: the bicycle repair caf\u00e9 vs. the infamous Copenhagen Wheel (see link below). But it's not an easy fight to pick. Europe has a strong neo-municipalist movement (Barcelona, Milan, Amsterdam, Bologna, Copenhagen...) that has largely ignored the early 2000s smart cities debate and focused on more productive issues, like fighting for control of corporate data produced on their citizens (Barcelona), enabling citizens to produce and maintain public goods (Bologna), and so on. However, they are the natural allies of the Toronto people. Good luck! \n\nhttp://www.cottica.net/2012/11/28/what-we-mean-by-smart-in-smart-cities/", "created_at": "2020-02-28 08:28:25.986602", "updated_at": "2020-02-28 08:31:37.680133", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 482, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 41.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [70558], "is_reply_to": [70558], "is_liked_by": [1856, 4892], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48916, "user_id": 2468, "topic_id": 9076, "post_number": 27, "raw": "another one : avoid using a mac (!) for running a server.

Of course the existential thread of lacking the means to finance yourself is much more pressing, but even those who are in steady and not at all endangered jobs but now are either unable to do their work or have to work differently from home have very emotional reactions to that.\n\nA friend of mine told me yesterday that she felt guilty in the first week of working from home because she felt like not working enough. Because processes are different and she would have waiting times or short stops while being at home she felt guilty. She is now using some of her overtime to shorten her hours while working from home to alleviate that feeling. \nIn a group with some other friends the question was carefully raised by another how they feel the amount of work they get done compares to what they usually get done. Obviously also inspired by the fear of not being able to get done enough in this form of work. The same person had just moments before told about how she was exhausted after working from a screen for 7 hours. \n\nI think we also have to discuss the loss of self value perception as is still connected to work in our society.\n\nMy mother is in early retirement for about 2 years now due to many health issues. Her 5 siblings have been making her feel guilty about that for most of it. She lives a very low cost live on the countryside and can come by with her retirement amount and does some volunteer work to stay busy. Yet I am sure quite often she still feels guilty to not continue working a badly paid shift job in the health sector that would hurt her health even more. Because \"one has to work\". The perceived default state of a human being is \"working\". And for some reason volunteer work or social and emotional work are never counted in this way. If you are not officially working in a classical sense, you are not contributing in the mind of many....and especially in the mind of many themselves. \nI have come to believe that people are most judgemental towards themselves in this way. That friend of mine who felt guilty about the perceived \"not proper work\" during her home-office would never question the \"realness\" of my work, which is often a collection of odd jobs and art projects, and more often than not in a \"home\" or distributed office somewhere. But for herself she would not give herself the \"freedom\" she gives me. And when I was searching for a \"proper job\" for an extended time after my masters degree while for the first time being unable to call myself a student the feeling of \"not contributing enough\" also drove me into a depressed state. I am trying actively to free myself from such \"proper job\" value assertions now. People can contribute in many many different ways and value of a human being should not even been connected to that. \n\nI would never judge my friends for not having\"proper jobs\" and not contributing. I know my friends, I know they are wonderful people and that they make the world better by being in it. And I want to give the same to myself. It is sad that my mothers siblings can not give that to her, but maybe we can try to make each new generation a bit less dependent on these harmful connection between self-worth and work.\n\n\nWe need to address and try to change this intrinsic (self)value attribution that is still so much connected to classical work models, which are increasingly going away either way. \n\nAre you, or have you heard from people who are now, even so they technically still have \"work\" but different work that they do not perceive as \"propper\" in the same way, suffering from self value issues?", "created_at": "2020-04-03 15:24:29.610045", "updated_at": "2020-04-03 15:24:29.610045", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 685, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 87.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 4, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 3, 6358, 6425], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80718, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13023, "post_number": 34, "raw": "A pandemic brings new challenges and chances to co-living. @nachorodriguez, what have been the experiences regarding that in your community?", "created_at": "2020-07-20 08:56:18.682474", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 08:56:18.682474", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 7.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79889, "user_id": 6455, "topic_id": 14006, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@kajafarszky", "created_at": "2020-07-03 10:01:22.231713", "updated_at": "2020-07-03 10:01:34.378142", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53509, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9867, "post_number": 3, "raw": "It's okay, sent them already for our team.", "created_at": "2019-05-15 05:53:44.522739", "updated_at": "2019-05-15 05:53:44.522739", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [53507], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55930, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10157, "post_number": 17, "raw": "[quote=\"alberto, post:16, topic:10157\"]\nAha.

We do this while looking for a business model that combines network building with meaningful work, as I believe is the strongest lesson that edgeryders as a whole has to offer. Here\u2019s the state of things six months in, as far as I can tell:\n\n## We started from the treaded path of culture making in urban spaces, and it opened new ways.\n\nFor one, motivated edgeryders members brought their own ideas and asked edgeryders to stand in as the implementing organisation: biggest case in question is that with @matteo_uguzzoni @GotheInstitutAthen @sebquack and others we are starting [Trust in Play](https://edgeryders.eu/t/trust-in-play-october-update/9092), an international community school of urban game designers! \n\nSecondly, our track record of working in European Capitals of Culture continues in the background. A few weeks ago, @johncoate, Alex and I hosted a training in community building for Rijeka 2020 (Croatia) and hope to go back for more hands on work. \n\nThe latest is that in Timisoara (Romania), we are building a community platform servicing civically minded groups ahead of the city's year of European Capital of Culture in 2021. Thanks to @Val.Muresan @simona.fit and others, we are moving from a consultancy model towards community partnerships, which means that we don't work with the city directly, but with local active groups, and connect them to international counterparts. No more landing and take off after a project please. I like this because it's in sync with the edgeryders direction: to help grow mutually beneficial local communities, with strong local leadership, who learn together and from each other, through a connective layer of technical infrastructure to share resources, knowledge, practices etc (like The Reef in Brussels; OpenVillage in Tunisia; and Blivande in Sweden).\n\n## What is in the making? RebelVillage and a research project where we look for collaborators\n\nUltimately, the Culture Squad is born out of our desire to break new ground in making culture from experiences of communal living and working, with impact. We don\u2019t know yet how this would look like. For sure, it has to do with using our ability to generate deep insights from collective intelligence and online conversation. We know we want to see physical instantiations out of this - the results of interaction made into powerful showcases: residencies and local exchanges, festivals, exhibitions which reach new significance levels because of constantly adding and refining knowledge and aesthetics.\n \nOur first test case for community co-created art is **Rebel Village** (concept phase) \u2013 a collaborative art camp where activists work with artists to create cultural responses to broken politics. It ties with the human rights advocacy work done by partners in Sicily, who with @natalia_skoczylas just submitted a proposal for Creative Europe. It ties with the Edgeryders upcoming [PopRebel research](https://edgeryders.eu/t/poprebel-win-get-ready-for-edgeryding-populism-from-2019/8870) on the populism and adds to it renewed social cohesion through community creations. From the feedback we are gathering as we share the concept around the network, it seems that the strongest points are its timeliness (unanimity on this!) and our proven ability to build communities, but we are lacking still a path to show high quality, meaningful cultural works (and artefacts), and claim to impact and fame (!).\n\n## Here's where we need help and how others can get involved: \n1. Join in to explore how edgy activist and or intentional communities (political, climate change, technology, solar punk etc.) can create cultural productions, practices and aesthetics with societal impact. We're already looking at a new, multi-annual in-depth research ([Horizon 2020](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/transformations-17-2019.html)) and have identified a funding call. We can already start with a practical exploration or a workshop together, or maybe you are already working on something that fits? We're game.\n2. Do you know of experienced cultural organisations or universities who are already studying innovation in artistic productions and societal impact?

It <em>has</em> to be that way, because it's a workspace for many different things, has lots of features and people actually use it. This makes it almost impossible for a newcomer to figure out what's what.</li>\n\n<li>#LOTE is going to attract a lot of newcomers. So we felt the need for a simple, read-only website to serve as a point of entry. We did the same for LOTE1 and LOTE2. In other words, logical separation is what we are looking for here.</li>\n\n<li>links bringing the visitor from the minisite to the main site are strategically placed across the former. The idea is: here is some curated information. If, after perusing it, you decide you want in, we'll move you to the workspace, which is a read-and-write website. We also provide human interfaces to guide your transition.</li>\n\n<li>the way I would solve the problem of linking back from the minisite to the main site is as follows. We now have a LOTE3 item menu, that leads to the workspace. I would change that menu item so that it leads to the minisite instead. We can also change the alt text so that mouseover gives you a hint: \"All about the \\#LOTE event\", or something like that.</li>\n\n<li>we are already using a separate third-level domain (lote.edgeryders.eu) for the existing Wordpress minisite</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo, I guess: my preference would be for a separate minisite, using our existing Drupal install with the Virtual Site or Sites module and its own third-level domain. This may also help tomorrow's corporate website, which is my next project: as we talk to prospective customers, it's clear that we need somewhere to catch them. Drupal Commons is a great workspace, as it allows for different groups to work on separate things while still staying within sight of each other: but it's clear we need tidier corners of the website for cases in which we need to present editorialized information to people who will read or look, but not necessarily participate.\n\nIf this is technically not possible or exceedingly hard, the next best is to do as you say: we keep the top-level menu and use the LOTE minisite menu as a second-level one.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-30 14:58:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:27.798252", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 416, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67042, "user_id": 5538, "topic_id": 12111, "post_number": 3, "raw": "@johncoate \u2014 I kind of subscribe to the [data as pollution](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/01/data_as_polluti.html) meme; I simply minimize the about of data I store at my edge, clean regularly, and avoid signing up to additional services like the plague.\n\nWhile it would be inconvenient; I can wipe out my tablets, cellphone and computer and in a day or so can be back at a similar state than before; since I have sorted the \u201cbring joy\u201d data from the cruft.", "created_at": "2019-12-05 20:39:59.857874", "updated_at": "2019-12-05 20:39:59.857874", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 85, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [66942], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88970, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 15105, "post_number": 1, "raw": "*\"In Sweden in 2020, digitalisation has had to show what it's good for, and the internet has been an invaluable help during the pandemic.

Dwoje w 10 i jedno 21 tygodniu ci\u0105\u017cy. Pierwsze poronienie prze\u017cy\u0142am do\u015b\u0107 spokojnie, cho\u0107 marzyli\u015bmy o tr\u00f3jce dzieci. By\u0142o mi smutno i czu\u0142am si\u0119 bardzo s\u0142aba, ale po kilku tygodniach \u017cycia zaabsorbowanego przez starsze c\u00f3rki, zycie wr\u00f3ci\u0142o do normy. T\u0142umaczy\u0142am sobie, \u017ce mo\u017ce tak mia\u0142o by\u0107, bo mo\u017ce nasze dziecko w ten spos\u00f3b zosta\u0142o uratowane przed jakim\u015b ogromnym cierpieniem w przysz\u0142o\u015bci. I tylko, co jaki\u015b czas kt\u00f3ra\u015b ze starszych c\u00f3rek pyta\u0142a np. \u201eA pami\u0119tasz jak nasz dzidziu\u015b zachorowa\u0142 i umar\u0142?\u201d, a ja odpowiada\u0142am ze \u015bci\u015bni\u0119tym gard\u0142em.\n\nNa kolejne dziecko czekali\u015bmy 7 lat. Nie m\u00f3wili\u015bmy nikomu, \u017ce jestem w ci\u0105\u017cy dop\u00f3ki nie min\u0119\u0142y pierwsze trzy miesi\u0105ce. Dopiero gdy zd\u0105\u017cy\u0142am si\u0119 ucieszy\u0107, \u017ce teraz ju\u017c wszystko b\u0119dzie dobrze okaza\u0142 si\u0119, \u017ce nasz synek nie \u017cyje, okr\u0119ci\u0142 si\u0119 p\u0119powin\u0105. Opisz\u0119 jego por\u00f3d, bo to bardzo by\u0142o traumatyzuj\u0105ce. W 21 tygodniu ci\u0105\u017cy zacz\u0119\u0142am krwawi\u0107, wi\u0119c jak najszybciej pojecha\u0142am do pobliskiego Dotar\u0142am tam po 20 minutach. Odnalaz\u0142am oddzia\u0142 medycyny ratunkowej, gdzie powiedziano mi, \u017ce teraz nie ma mn\u0105 si\u0119 kto zaj\u0105\u0107 i mam poczeka\u0107 na korytarzu. Poniewa\u017c wydawa\u0142o mi si\u0119, \u017ce w sytuacji krwawienia w ci\u0105\u017cy wskazane jest le\u017cenie, po\u0142o\u017cy\u0142am si\u0119 w jednej z sal dla pacjent\u00f3w. W\u00f3wczas zainteresowa\u0142a si\u0119 mn\u0105 piel\u0119gniarka (nakrzycza\u0142a na mnie, \u017ce czemu le\u017c\u0119) i po konsultacji z lekarzem skierowa\u0142a na oddzia\u0142 ginekologiczno-po\u0142o\u017cniczy. Tam zarejestrowano mnie, przyj\u0119to na odzia\u0142 i polecono czeka\u0107 na konsultacje lekarsk\u0105. Moje oczekiwanie trwa\u0142o 1,5h. Po tym czasie zbada\u0142 mnie lekarz (\u017cartuj\u0105c nieustannie) i wykona\u0142 USG stwierdzaj\u0105c, \u017ce dziecko nie \u017cyje. Nie powiedzia\u0142 jednak tego do mnie tylko do po\u0142o\u017cnej zapisuj\u0105cej wyniki badania m\u00f3wi\u0105c \u201ew jamie macicy p\u0142\u00f3d martwy w po\u0142o\u017ceniu miednicowym\u201d Potem podyktowa\u0142 reszt\u0119 wynik\u00f3w i zwr\u00f3ci\u0142 sie do mnie z pytaniem czy s\u0142ysza\u0142am i informacj\u0105, \u017ce w dniu jutrzejszym zostanie wywo\u0142any por\u00f3d.\n\nPo\u0142o\u017cono mnie na 6 osobowej sali z 2 kobietami w ci\u0105\u017cy i 3 przed lub po zabiegach ginekologicznych. Po\u0142o\u017cne i piel\u0119gniarki pracuj\u0105ce na oddziale oraz jedna z lekarek by\u0142y bardzo \u017cyczliwe i taktowne. Odpowiada\u0142y na wszystkie moje pytania dotycz\u0105ce pogrzebu, bada\u0144 histopatologicznych itp., jednak o wszystko sama musia\u0142am si\u0119 dopyta\u0107. Pozostali lekarze byli raczej oboj\u0119tni.\n\nNast\u0119pnego dnia podano mi do szyjki macicy lek o nazwie cytotec (polecaj\u0105c uprzednio napisa\u0107 o\u015bwiadczenie, \u017ce w zwi\u0105zku z obumarciem ci\u0105\u017cy ja prosz\u0119 o jej rozwi\u0105zanie), poinformowano, \u017ce por\u00f3d powinien trwa\u0107 6 godzin i polecono wr\u00f3ci\u0107 na sal\u0119. Tam w\u015br\u00f3d pozosta\u0142ych pacjentki i odwiedzaj\u0105cych je i \u017cartuj\u0105cych ludzi le\u017ca\u0142am z nasilaj\u0105cymi si\u0119 skurczami. Po 6 godzinach zbadano mnie i podano Pyralgin, z powodu silnego b\u00f3lu. Kilkakrotnie prosi\u0142am o przeniesienie w jakie\u015b odosobnione miejsce, jednak powtarzano mi, \u017ce nie ma takiej mo\u017cliwo\u015bci ze wzgl\u0119du na brak miejsc. Dopiero ok. godz. 19.00 po\u0142o\u017cna wyprosi\u0142a m\u0119\u017cczyzn odwiedzaj\u0105cych pacjentki z sali. Poniewa\u017c por\u00f3d by\u0142 bardzo bolesny, pozosta\u0142e pacjentki postanowi\u0142y wyj\u015b\u0107 do \u015bwietlicy. Dzi\u0119ki temu ostatni\u0105 godzin\u0119 porodu sp\u0119dzi\u0142am tylko z m\u0119\u017cem i zagl\u0105daj\u0105ca od czasu do czasu po\u0142o\u017cn\u0105. Po urodzeniu si\u0119 dziecka zabrano mnie do gabinetu zabiegowego na zabieg wy\u0142y\u017ceczkowania jamy macicy.\n\nPrzez pierwsze tygodnie po \u015bmierci synka nie by\u0142o we mnie \u017cadnych uczu\u0107 opr\u00f3cz wszechogarniaj\u0105cego smutku. Niby dobrze si\u0119 trzyma\u0142am, nie p\u0142aka\u0142am zbyt du\u017co, nie histeryzowa\u0142am, nie denerwowa\u0142am na widok kobiet w ci\u0105\u017cy czy niemowl\u0105t. Czu\u0142am tylko tak\u0105 ogromna pustk\u0119 i ogromne zm\u0119czenie. I samotno\u015b\u0107, nawet mimo \u015bwiadomo\u015bci, \u017ce bliscy s\u0105 obok. Przera\u017ca\u0142a mnie wizja powrotu do pracy, m\u0119czy\u0142y spotkania z lud\u017ami. Nie mog\u0142am spa\u0107 przez kilka dni z rz\u0119du, a potem spa\u0142am po kilkana\u015bcie godzin na dob\u0119, tak samo z jedzeniem: albo nic, albo wi\u0119cej ni\u017c zwykle.\n\nDziwne wydawa\u0142o mi si\u0119, \u017ce \u015bwiat nadal istnieje, nie zatrzyma\u0142 si\u0119, s\u0142o\u0144ce wschodzi\u0142o co rano, \u017cycie toczy\u0142o dalej pe\u0142ne rado\u015bci. Tylko ja gdzie\u015b obok. Dobrze mi by\u0142o gdy wyjechali\u015bmy na rodzinne wakacje, las, jezioro, potem g\u00f3ry. Spok\u00f3j. Nic nie musia\u0142am. Gdyby tylko mo\u017cna by\u0142o nie wraca\u0107, tylko zaszy\u0107 si\u0119 gdzie\u015b ju\u017c na zawsze. Powr\u00f3t do \u015bwiata, do pracy mnie przera\u017ca\u0142. I wszystko wydawa\u0142o si\u0119 takie bezsensowne. Czu\u0142am si\u0119 taka rozdwojona: na zewn\u0105trz funkcjonuj\u0105ca normalnie, potrafi\u0105ca \u017cartowa\u0107 czy wyg\u0142upia\u0107 si\u0119 z dzie\u0107mi, a w \u015brodku - ogromna t\u0119sknota. Potem pojawi\u0142a si\u0119 z\u0142o\u015b\u0107. Taka na wszystko i na wszystkich. Cokolwiek by si\u0119 dzia\u0142o, czy kto\u015b co\u015b m\u00f3wi\u0142, czy milcza\u0142 \u2013 jednakowo mnie to irytowa\u0142o.\n\nCa\u0142y czas mia\u0142am potrzeb\u0119 opowiadania ludziom o naszym synku, \u017ceby pami\u0119tali, \u017ce by\u0142. Cho\u0107 do\u015bwiadcza\u0142am ca\u0142ego spektrum ich reakcji: od zrozumienia i wsparcia, przez g\u0142upawe komentarze i uwagi, po zupe\u0142ne milczenie i udawanie, \u017ce nic si\u0119 nie sta\u0142o. I trudno wyra\u017ca\u0107 \u017ca\u0142ob\u0119 po dziecku, kt\u00f3rego nikt nie widzia\u0142 i po kt\u00f3rym nic nie zosta\u0142o z wyj\u0105tkiem aktu urodzenia. Nie mamy nawet grobu. Pr\u00f3bowa\u0142am wynajdywa\u0107 r\u00f3\u017cne strategie przetrwana: szuka\u0142am zdj\u0119\u0107 dzieci w podobnym wieku, wierszy, na r\u0119ce nosz\u0119 czarna bransoletk\u0119, zacz\u0119\u0142am pisa\u0107 na forum www.poronienie.pl, spotyka\u0142am si\u0119 z psychologiem w Poradni Zdrowia Psychicznego. Z powodu prze\u017cy\u0107 szpitalnych przechorowa\u0142am PTSD. Od innych matek po stracie i psychologa s\u0142ysza\u0142am, \u017ce to naturalne co czuj\u0119, \u017ce z czasem b\u00f3l ucichnie, cho\u0107 t\u0119sknota pozostanie, \u017ce to co robi\u0119 jest typowe dla etapu \u017ca\u0142oby, w kt\u00f3rym jestem. To bardzo pomaga\u0142o. Cho\u0107 najwi\u0119kszym wsparciem by\u0142 m\u00f3j m\u0105\u017c, kt\u00f3ry, mimo, \u017ce nie zawsze rozumia\u0142, co si\u0119 ze mn\u0105 dzieje, by\u0142 obok. Potem pomy\u015bla\u0142am, \u017ce mo\u017ce mog\u0142abym jako\u015b odwdzi\u0119czy\u0107 si\u0119 i zaanga\u017cowa\u0142am si\u0119 spo\u0142ecznie w prac\u0119 Stowarzyszenia Rodzic\u00f3w po Poronieniu, \u017ceby jako\u015b pom\u00f3c innym kobietom, kt\u00f3re dopiero znajda si\u0119 w sytuacji \u015bmierci dziecka.

Przygotowujemy rodzic\u00f3w do narodzin \u015bmiertelnie chorego dziecka. O ile trafi\u0105 do nas.

A lot has happened. I feel like I've been here for months already :slight_smile:\n\nFirst of all, the first week of my stay was marked by constant arrivals and departures. Many of the residents went back to their countries to work on their regular jobs or renew visas. There was a parade of guests and passers-by as well, providing us with a lot of unforgettable moments, but didn't help to establish a routine. It took me a few days of introductions, movie screenings, late dinners, bicycle rides, morning sport, cooking sessions and visits to Essaouira, to finally feel like I've satisfied my need of an explorer and a social being to finally sit down and really concentrate on work. We've had a fantastic night with a couple of musicians who dropped by our home and played a concert for us - pure pure magic. It was an unplugged, singer-songwritter night with two duos with both quite different estetics and energies. We've got plenty of Cohen's, Fleetwood Mac's and Amy Winehouses, in excellent interpretations. Beautiful! \n\nWe've been also visited by a fellow nomad, Esteban, who travels around the world and makes ends meet with some juggling, playing and social work. We've hosted a couple of friends from Germany who intern in Marrakesh at the moment - at the hospital and in a permaculture project. All these meetings brought a lot of energy and great discussions to the house. \n\nNow I can tell it seems possible - to work in a community, share one home and quite successfully carve out space and time for both living and working, together and individually. Right now, as we're back to a modest size, it's even easier. We know who's cooking and cleaning, we've learned the efficient shopping, and we juggle very well moments when we sit down over unpeeled coffee beans or lunch to talk and spend time together. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dbd97b76711a27c7a7541e6300d713a6d069b28d.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c3cd2773ab9410cbd13d1fbd1509be718c9f2144.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">\n\nIn terms of work we're doing on our own projects, there are a few ideas we're collectively and individually developing.  There is the very interesting business idea of @Sofien-Dahem who's trying to establish a nomadic project that will document and modernize traditional African crafts. So far, we couldn't help with much - and his idea seems pretty decently developed, based on his experience in a similar project before. Yet we could have helped him with finding the right place to register his company by recommending him Estonia and it's e-residency. \n\n@HadeerGhareeb is struggling with intriguing Moroccan bureaucracy that makes it difficult to organize workshops in schools or even with volunteers from local organizations. She's planning on making an art project from waste - there's plenty of material around (Brrrrr), and we're now trying to both get the confirmations from authorities but also find alternatives to make it happen, in case there is no permission anytime soon. \n\n@islem will tell us tonight in detail about her idea of opening a coworking space in her town in Tunisia.  This might be where my support can be a bit more visible, as I've been busy for the past 10 days sparking interest in my Polish friends and then working on several applications to open a coworking space in Lublin. This is an exercise for us - the city offers a decently sized office space in the center with a grant of 40.000 zl (a bit under 10.000 eur) to be used between may 2017 and the end of the year, to test ideas for social businesses and coworking space. I've teamed up with a bunch of great old friends who are active in human rights, education, and arts in Lublin and who dream of a space we'd have for our use. The application is bloody simple and fast, and it would allow us to try out the team dynamics and the idea, as we're planning to apply for further grants for innovation and social businesses in the same city, and try to convince Velux to buy with us a property for that purpose *(we've spotted already a fantastic space). If that succeeds, I'd like to dedicate a significant amount of that space to the creation of a very first biohacklab in Poland - and invite our fellows edgeryders to help us explore the topic and find the right course for the space for the future. The funding of the space could also be connected to what we're working on with @Nadia - crowdfunded, co-owned properties. \n\n <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/760bceb35d428c247e6cec3a2dd09ead031110f7.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\nI'm also supporting a little @Matthias with his optical coffee sorter by using a very avant-garde tool (smartphone strapped to a halved plastic bottle, plus a white sheet of paper, plus a plastic box) to make high resolution pictures of coffee beans that would be later cut up by @anu and fed to machine learning software. I am calling this part of my experience The Future of Work - humans supporting machines. I've done some of that yesterday while guiding our pool-cleaning robot in areas he ignored... \n\nAnd @alex_levene is experimenting with remote work, while providing us with cultural food for thought.  \n\nI've always wanted to live in a community, despite the fact it would sound like a total failure to my parents.

Introduction <a name=\"chap-1\"></a>\n\nWhen discussing aerial ropeways for mountain village with my brother, we came up with another idea for how transportation can be done in areas without motorable roads: electric cargo bicycles.\n\nThis proposal is meant for villages in mountainous regions, for example in Nepal. In these areas, there are usually no bicycles because they are pretty useless: on all these steep hills, it is simpler and just as fast to walk, and driving with significant loads is just impossible. Off-the-shelf [high-powered e-bikes](http://www.hi-powercycles.com/mountain-offroad/) would work, but are not affordable in these areas. Also, they have no proper options to transport cargo.\n\nHowever, it turns out that similar e-bikes specialized for cargo transport could be operated as a profitable rental business and even poor people will be able to rent them. Here are some back-of-envelope calculations:\n\n\n## 2. Design outline <a name=\"chap-2\"></a>\n\nWe assume a typical small market town in a valley with several villages around it, each with 600 m height difference. E-bike charging stations are built in the valley and the villages, powered by photovoltaics.\n\nThe bicycles would be cargo bikes built like mountain bikes extended in length. To further improve their off-road capabilities, they could have all-wheel drive for better traction. The front wheel would use a wheel hub motor, and the back wheel a bracket mounted motor for better hill climbing abilities. Transmission to the rear wheel hub will be with a toothed rubber belt (without any lubricants!), using a [gear box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gearbox_bicycle) at the bracket for changing gears. Avoiding any open, lubricated parts this way will avoid most wear and tear. In this setup, only the front motor can be used for regenerative braking, but that is sufficient as the front brake delivers >70% of the braking power anyway.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/16877c708bbc4ed6b788d67a46a8443d8b3e3970.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"458\">\n\n_**Longtail cargo bicycle \u2013 a similar but electric version is envisioned here.**_\n_(Source: [here on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wittcogmbh/7360173402), by [wittco.gmbh](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wittcogmbh/), licenced [CC-BY2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/))_\n\nThere are a few bicycles that come quite close to the proposed design:\n\n* **[Portal Long-Tail](http://www.portalbikes.org/long-tail#introduction).** Not an electric bicycle, but the right type of cargo bicycle and already used in Nepal. [The price](http://www.portalbikes.org/nepal-store) is only ca. 320 EUR (40,000 NPR), and it could be a suitable base for an electric conversion.\n\n* **[Radwagon](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radwagon-electric-cargo-bike).** Very similar to the cargo bike envisioned here, with a long frame, side boards for cargo, a 750 W motor and a 670 Wh battery. It is available for 1270 EUR (1500 USD) when not sold out. So 1000 EUR for one with a somewhat smaller battery, local fabrication and \"open source components\" is hopefully possible.\n\n* **[HPC 2018 SuperMundo Cargo Bike](http://www.hi-powercycles.com/2017-hpc-supermundo-cargo-bike/).** With a 3000 W motor and a 2.7 kWh battery, this is the highest-performing electric cargo bicycle made so far. Obviously, it is not cheap: 8700 USD with in the highest-powered variant described here. There's a [video with a detailed description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IapOztxR96g), and another [video of the cycle in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I-F9iRUgyg).\n\n    (Note, the battery capacity was deducted from 945 Wh for 35 miles range and 100 miles range but no capacity indicated for the extended battery: 945 Wh / 35 miles * 100 miles = 2700 Wh.)\n\n\n## 3. Operating costs <a name=\"chap-3\"></a>\n\nLifting a total weight of 80 kg (60 kg driver plus 20 kg bicycle) for 600 m requires 130 Wh: 80 kg * 600 m * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 / 3600 s/h = 130 Wh. With an additional 60 kg load (or a passenger \u2026) it is 229 Wh.\n\nAssuming these 600 m height difference has an average 15% inclination, it means a road length of 4000 m. Assuming an uphill travel speed of ideally 20 km/h, it would mean a travel time of 4 km / 20 km/h = 0.2 h = 12 min. Using 229 Wh in 12 min means a power of 229 Wh / 0.2 h = 1145 W. Quite doable \u2013 that's a 300 W \"very standard\" front wheel hub motor, a 700 W gearbox motor, and 145 W human assistive power.\n\nA 550 Wh battery will be sufficient when assuming 60% depth of discharge (20-80%, as it extends LiIon battery lifetime to 1,500 cycles for a LIPO4 battery, see here) while allowing for a depreciation down to 70% of design capacity: 229 Wh * (100/60) * (100/70) = 545 Wh. Some of the energy used (let's assume half) can be recovered by regenerative braking.\n\nWe assume 0.40 EUR/Wh for the required high-current LiIon cells (requiring a discharge time of 15 minutes, or \"4C\"). This price tag is very realistic, see for example the high-current (8C - 12 C) \"LG HG2\" cells, [selling for 0.41 EUR/Wh](https://www.ebay.de/itm/122943121987) in packs of 10 (we extracted the shipment price here). So a 550 Wh battery would cost: 550 Wh * 0.4 EUR/Wh = 220 EUR. If such a battery can be used for 1,500 cycles, it means 220 EUR / 1,500 cycles = 0.147 EUR/cycle = 18.6 NPR/cycle.\n\nAssuming another 0.075 EUR/cycle for other spare parts and 0.075 EUR/cycle for maintenance time and rental company profits, this adds up to ca. 0.30 EUR/cycle.\n\n\n## 4. Cost comparison with small ropeways <a name=\"chap-4\"></a>\n\nLet's compare these costs to aerial ropeways by looking at the specific transportation costs. For comparability of \"costs per kilometer\", we assume the load is transported uphill in a straight line of 1 km with 600 m height difference, as it would be done with a ropeway. According to the calculation above, transporting a 60 kg load for 600 m uphill would cost: 0.30 EUR / (60 kg * 1 km) = 0.35 USD / (60 kg * 1 km) = 0.00583 USD/(kg*km). This is comparable to small aerial ropeways in developing regions, as I once calculated 0.0070 USD/(kg*km) for the example of the small-scale Barpak ropeway in Nepal, using numbers from [this publication](http://www.nwcf.org.np/cms/resources/pdf/Ropeway.pdf).\n\nIn addition to  having comparable operation costs, electric cargo bicycles have way lower setup costs (ca. 1000 USD for per bicycle), scale much better, and are more redundant: the system still works even if half of the bicycles break.\n\n\n## 5. Cost comparison with porters <a name=\"chap-5\"></a>\n\nIn Nepal, the Barpak ropway was about 4 times cheaper than mule transport and 5 times cheaper than a porter (according to numbers from [here](http://www.nwcf.org.np/cms/resources/pdf/Ropeway.pdf)), so electric cargo bikes are also as much cheaper.\n\nThis assumes that everyone transports their own cargo, so worktime is not factored in as a cost \u2013 when transporting cargo for others due to large amounts of for example building materials, this would be different. In these cases, electric cargo bicycles become a tool for porters to earn more: \n\nBefore porters would earn five times more than the transportation fee of the Barpak ropeway, with kilometers counted straight uphill \"as the ropeway goes\": 5 * 0.0070 USD/(kg*km) = 0.035 USD/(kg*km). Now they have to rent the electric bicycle, which lowers their earnings to 0.035 USD/(kg*km) - 0.00583 USD/(kg*km) = 0.02917 USD/(kg*km). However, they can transport load now at 20 km/h uphill instead of 3-4 km/h on foot \u2013 let's say 4 times faster as 20 km/h will not always be possible on bad paths. This increases their daily earnings by: 4 * 0.02917 USD/(kg*km) / (5 * 0.0070 USD/(kg*km)) = 333%. Some of that saving will be forwarded to customers, but they are surely not out of business.\n\n\n## 6. Running an electric bicycle rental business <a name=\"chap-6\"></a>\n\nSome practical considerations: payment would depend on the amount of energy used, to let users contribute to the battery depreciation costs. Booking and payment would be made with a phone (including smartphones via an app, but that is optionally). Like in similar systems in cities, users would get a code to open a number lock. The position of the e-bikes would be tracked by GPS, to prevent theft.\n\nIn addition, there are interesting additional ways to make business with these electric bicycles. They are basically high-powered electric motors on wheels. This allows to also rent them out with machinery for stationary processing, connected via a power-take-off (PTO) shaft [like here](http://www.portalbikes.org/portal-pto):\n\n* corn shelling, with a corn sheller mounted on the back [like here](http://www.portalbikes.org/pto-features)\n* cereals grinder\n* water pump, with required hoses also transported on the cargo bicycle\n* winnowing machine\n\nFor these stationary uses, it will often be better to operate the motor directly on solar energy, to not strain the batteries. This is possible by also transporting a mobile set of photovoltaics panels on the bicycle, so it can produce its own energy anywhere while the battery acts as a buffer.", "created_at": "2018-06-16 20:57:50.856164", "updated_at": "2018-09-26 20:47:28.498722", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1642, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 743.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4265, 3704, 3791, 3782, 3826], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3113, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 3080, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2014-05-29 11:35:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:17.282529", "deleted_at": "2017-09-17 11:37:24.492725", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16268, "user_id": 209, "topic_id": 4488, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Story of collaboration</b>\n\nHi Noemi,\n\nThe Lab project is still in early stage.

Lets help each other to find what really matters to us most!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-17 20:26:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:31.360368", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 101, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1457], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77950, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 13735, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-06-02 10:09:38.879530", "updated_at": "2020-06-02 10:09:38.879530", "deleted_at": "2020-06-02 10:16:59.818672", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68024, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12273, "post_number": 5, "raw": "With the kids\n\n![20191231_130414|690x517](upload://posxsMfjQ8Y8GMFv0H8ZO9wBxfl.jpeg)", "created_at": "2019-12-31 12:34:43.881498", "updated_at": "2019-12-31 12:34:43.881498", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 52.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [68020], "is_liked_by": [4934, 5698, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35387, "user_id": 3884, "topic_id": 6883, "post_number": 3, "raw": "you have great ideas  The OpenVLage view can be integrated into the selected areas by appointing one of those areas to serve as your ambassador . i'm with you any time", "created_at": "2017-09-04 18:42:30.043825", "updated_at": "2017-09-04 18:42:30.043825", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 54.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16361, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 6293, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Improving engagement</b>\n\nMake this site easier to use. \u00a0the good news is we have a plan to do that.\n\nI have been using edgeryders.eu pretty continually for about a year and a half. \u00a0While it works pretty well for specific project needs, it isn't very conducive to \"hanging out\" and having conversations where you don't know where they\u00a0might lead. \u00a0Ultimately, for things to really gel, the platform itself needs to be engaging enough that other social media sites are used for what they are demonstrably good for: attracting people to see something in particular. \u00a0But more synergies develop when the site itself is a pleasurable enough place to hang out on its own. \u00a0Not easy to do. \u00a0Few sites actually accomplish it, which contributes to both the \"winner take all\" aspect of big league sites like FB which in turn tends to feed our collective shrinking attention spans.\n\nFacebook to me is sort of like Pac Man - it goads you into going forward, ever scrolling towards whatever\u00a0turns up next. \u00a0Being photo and video rich accelerates that a great deal.

A natural step up is to get into long-term relationship with one of farmers and combine her/his proficiency and land with enthusiasm and labour of cooperatists. In most developed cases (Freiburg, Germany for example) the cooperative owns the land and some of cooperatists are professional farmers, running the production. In Freiburg (http://www.gartencoop.org/freiburg/) every coop member spends 4 days per year working on the farm, plus some support for food distribution, plus paying share of cost coverage.\n\nAs a result they set up a well-balanced system, where, without commercial relationships, everyone has their needs covered. The completely excluded State and City Hall from their loop, which personally pleases me the most. ;-)\n\nAnyway, going through the model of Community Supported Agriculture seems to be a way to lower the treshold between guerilla gardening and serious food poduction.

We meet, we connect, we understand where we\u2019re all coming from and see what common priorities and topics emerge, then Edgeryders manages the community to follow up and explore new projects with those interested. \n \n**18 Participants**: Entrepreneurs, farmers, activists, researchers, public servants, EU workers in service of the agriculture sector, and people passionate about food.\n**Countries:** Serbia, Poland, Croatia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, US (and others where some participants originate)\n \n### The image of the farmer is a primary concern in food sustainability\n\n@angelo: I\u2019m from Italy, I live in Brussels since 2010. I\u2019ve been covering agricultural news exclusively for 7 years, and since 2016 also environment, climate and EU policy. I write for ANSA, the main Italian news agency, and I also collaborate as a writer with other projects, such as a Horizon2020 on plant health. I met edgeryders 10 years ago and was really interested in the open approach.\nI\u2019m concerned about the gap between urban and rural, farmers and environmentalists, and this is something I would like to overcome. I cannot stand these ideological battles. I\u2019d like to contribute to fill the gap.\n \n@Paco21: I\u2019m living 30km in the North of Brussels, in Flemish Keerbergen. I\u2019m staff for the Flemish Land Agency, a gov agency in charge of rural development [..] Sometime I\u2019m advising my friends in Africa in sustainable agriculture, because I\u2019m an agronomist specialising in rural ecology. \nMy concern is the perception that we have regarding the farmers. **All the problems start with the way we look at farmers. We tend not to take seriously the work they are doing.** We have more respect for someone who is a teacher, who has a PhD etc. The farmer is the one producing the food: if you don\u2019t have anyone producing the food, you can have all the degrees but there is an issue. Besides, there is a social and environmental care and the role of biodiversity that we don\u2019t put a focus on.\n \n### Are policy instruments like the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) Agri working? How are local farmers accessing the funds? \n@Paco21: The purpose of EIP was to change the way we look at things. It is happening slowly, but we saw the increase of the people involved in the process. Ex: in Horizon, the EC research program, in the past they were always taking farmers as sub partners. But **one of the criteria to evaluate multi actor projects dealing with societal challenges is involving the farmers\u2019 community**. It is early to see the impact - we did it for only 8 years, and for the next period the system has been reinforced. What we got as feedback even from some researchers - they say that it is interesting that what they are doing is applied. But they are still reluctant, because it doesn\u2019t end with a nice publication in science journals.\n\nFirst of all, the issue is that you still have local authorities in between. There is no direct contact between EIP and local actors. Brussels is delegating everything at national level, but people still complain that they cannot access.\n\nRural development pillar 2. is really dedicated to local actors. Each region in Europe has that specific program and they are free to apply or not. As soon as the regions apply, **80% of the funding comes from the EC, and 20% from local funds. If you\u2019re not successful, you don\u2019t need to pay back**. The tricky thing is that the call for projects is launched by each state or region, and the local selection means everyone is free to organise a consortium.\n \n@Angelo: The EIP attempts to put together the practice and the theory. I can talk about the Italian experience. In the 20th century, there were itinerant professors, they went on the field. Most of this practice-theory approach is lost partly because of this publish-or-perish system that Pacome referred to. It\u2019s important because it\u2019s public research! Agricultural research until the 50s and 60s were mostly public. After that, corporations took their space and now agricultural research is mostly corporate. Nothing bad in that. They do their job and want the return on investment. We need instead something that is not related only to ROI, something related to communities and everyday problems. There are 2 sides to the coin: we need more local, everyday problem research, and more long term big research. And we need the public sector support and openness in both these two levels of research and innovation.\n\n@Nadia: What stands in the way of building new journals or publication channels that premier that kind of practice oriented research?\n \n@Angelo: If I remember well, one of the drivers of this EIP approach was the consideration of the researchers themselves, that they were totally separated from the farmers.\n\n@Paco21: There is no testing on the field. For some of the researchers it started to be boring to do things where people don\u2019t see the results. Local farmers sometimes don\u2019t have the ways to reach the researchers, they speak other languages etc. They know they have a problem here, and would need the solution. We are bringing them together. In the agriculture environment, the problems are complex, you don\u2019t have one researcher that has the answer. You need different expertise to come to a common solution.  The way we perceive the farmer is important: we need to make him feel proud of what is doing. Right now they\u2019re ashamed, it\u2019s not rewarding to say: I\u2019m a farmer. **I usually say a farmer is an entrepreneur.**\n \n### The cost of farming innovation and why local food is more expensive\n \n@FrankDieters: I live in Germany, but I work in the Netherlands. I recognise a lot of what I heard here. What I find very important from my experience and the research we did in the province of Limburg (south of NL), we have an innovative agricultural complex, international campus that specialises in food innovations and new business models. \nIt touched me when Pacome said we have to see the farmer as an important part of our communities. What we found was that the transition of the agro complex has to take into account that innovation power (= what comes after the first innovation) is financially driven. Our subsidies are most often focused on the first innovation, first pilot. We expect that the rest of the sector incorporates that in their business models. In the last 20 years there was so much focus on producing more and more, and in such a way that the environment would be respected, that the farmers had to invest in that. To be able to have a farm with cows, you have to have stables with a certain system. They became more and more advanced, and the Dutch government updated the bar, so a lot of them don\u2019t have the means to implement a good solution in their own business. The banks don\u2019t want to give more loans, it\u2019s a high risk sector especially when entering the market.\n**We innovate, but if there\u2019s no way to incorporate that in the business model of the mass, you\u2019re not going to get to the transition that you want.** You\u2019re also wasting money, because the innovation doesn\u2019t have the sustainable impact.\n \nWhen we talk about local food being too pricy: the basic line is that if people pay more for their food, the farmer can earn more and therefore he has more money to innovate. But if we have a growing part of the population in precarious economic situation, the group that can actually afford to pay more for local products is getting smaller. You look at production and farmers, but in the end they need to be bought. Local food as a business model is not going to be a sustainable model.\n \n@Paco21: The problem: when you do produce something, you have the cost of production, and the price you need to live from your activity. We need to understand that the farmer needs a revenue to live off of that.\nI think there is an issue of the production cost: when you look at the huge farms, or imports, you come to the scale economies. If you want to make it affordable, we should look at the production factors. When you have input coming from the outside, expensive, the product will reflect the production cost. It is a specific sector, not like other commodities, and we cannot avoid the same principles. We are now considering agriculture as something like: you can produce everything. But at a cost.\n \n@Vladb : We do have a philosophy in our operation to make good food accessible, and the accessible food has to be good quality. Yes, you need to have an entrepreneurial mindset: we do have costs that cannot be amended. **In small farming, you cannot have the economies of scale, but you need to have some economics in your prices and match the costs with what the consumer can pay.** There may be the best tomatoes ever, but no one is going to buy them. In Romania, we have a large portion of the society that is unable to pay a large amount of money for exceptional quality. This puts me in the situation of having to find ways to make my farm more efficient. I do believe you need to have support for farmers to buy machinery and infrastructure that helps them lower the costs. The more investments you make, you can lower your costs and sell your products at a better price.\n \n@Nadia: When we were talking about research, I picked up that there were **channels through which knowledge is produced and validated, and it doesn\u2019t serve farmers, or they are not necessarily appreciated.** How new ideas and new models are coming into the farming community - and how tied this is to the social and political context? This conservative wave passing through the continent  - are we seeing that in farmers\u2019 communities, or are they completely disconnected? \n\n@angelo: The Farm-to-Fork strategy is the EU strategy for the next 10 years, it\u2019s about food sustainability. There was a lot of insistence to put into it some targets - not measurement tools, but rather political communication tools. For instance, we will cut halve the use of pesticides in 10 years. This is a good message for mobilizing urban dwellers. But farmers reaction in rural areas is: oh my god, and how am I going to make my living? This message is too simplistic and getting it as a target makes people in rural areas angry. So the message has the opposite effect on the two sides, galvanizing the urban dwellers and disappointing farmers. **The farmers, in my experience, are not champions of innovation, they are a bit conservative. They are thinking about making a living. With this kind of communication, you are pushing them towards the conservative way. There is this gap where we don\u2019t talk the same language.**\n \n@lylycarrillo: All those rules, legislations put a lot of administrative load on the farmers. To have a certification, they need to collect thousands of papers, so their work gets very complicated. Their work is affected by this load from even us as consumers wanting change. They are getting tired. To be honest, there are not enough farmers. **What do we need to do? Actually there is enough research, but we need farmers, we need to take care of them.**\n \n@Dragan_Jonic: **When I say that organic food has to be expensive, it doesn\u2019t mean it has to be so for the end user. The producer must receive much more incentives from the state, maybe some vouchers for the state to provide for the poorer population**. There\u2019s problems farmers have with all the paperwork, a phenomenon called bolshevization: they have to fill in forms and it takes a lot of their time which means food has to be expensive. For example, organic onions are 3 times more expensive than commercial one. On one hand, the food has to be expensive to reward producers, and on the other hand, if you want to be healthy, you have to pay a bit more for this. Otherwise the state will have to pay for your health.\n \nBreakout sessions raised the following issues:\n\n### What is food quality? \nFor @Vladb: to get a product with the best nutritional value and having little time from the farm to the fork. For Angelo: two ideas of quality- 1. food safety 2. taste and the uniqueness, the tradition behind a product - we might push more for that third notion of quality. For @EwaJ-L: \u2018We need a just transition in agriculture\u2019. \n \n### How do farmers handle administration? Do we/they need more digital?\nVlad: We had a strong digital presence from the get go. It\u2019s difficult to sell your product in a physical location - organic, not a huge quantity. I also prefer this. The support for administration and subsidies are poorly thought out, and not focus on growing small farmers into being better.\nAngelo: In the farming community the narrative of \u2018no alternative\u2019 is overwhelming, so I see a strong need to get more information and practical solutions: how to change the use of pesticides etc. This is far from the debate, we focus on the first part of innovation and then we also need to know how to make it available for everybody. This is what we called technical assistance.\n\n###  \u2018You need to offer them more than just a plot of land\u2019 \n\nThis is the topic discussed at length in the end of the session.

If I start from a specific conversation (say, that around the tag `ethno-poprebel`), I end up with a list of usernames of the people who participated into that conversation, and pseudonymize those. So far, so good. But, if one of them were to @mention or `[quote]` someone that is *not* part of that conversation, but nevertheless is part of Edgeryders, that person would not be pseudonymized. \n\nShould I instead check each post against all usernames in Edgeryders?

The most important resource, from any company or a country, are people. The investors put their money in people and ideas\u2026in human potential, not in companies. Why? Because they know the company will never succeed without a great team. How can we expect to prosper as a country if we do not invest in the members of our society?\n\nThat is why we decided the theme of this workshop will be creativity and entrepreneurship. Our focus is on young people: how to we help them fulfill their potential? What kind of support do they really need from us? From parents, from the municipality, school or various organisations working with children, like for example the social care centers? Children with difficulties functioning within standard rules and education might need our help the most.\nOur project was born out of that need to create an environment in which youth will flourish, in this case it will be the Becej Creative Hub, which we will present on this workshop.\n\n## Format\n\nWe are creating a partnership made of individuals and all organisations in Becej who want to contribute to empowering young people and through that improve the quality of life in their community. This workshop and the project we will present during it will be the result of a poll we conduct between teenagers of 3 high schools in Becej. It will be built through their participation as well.\n\n**Before workshop:** We connected with all 3 schools and few organisations, with goal of creating the needed partnership to and conduct the needed poll within the younger population so we can adapt the project to their needs as much as possible.\n\n **Why document everything:** The documentation from the discussions are redacted to ensure privacy of participants, then posted on the online discussion space for the festival. This enables us to do a number of things -\n\neasily reconnect with people we met across shared/complimentary interests\n\nbuild a high quality report summarising what knowledge has emerged from the discussions\n\nkeep everyone informed about new, relevant, opportunities for professional and personal development, follow up events etc\n\n**Program:**\n\nIntroduction, Who are Edgeryders (5 min + 5 min Q&amp;A)\n\nProject \u201cWellbeing in Serbia\u201d: how to use the platform, the importance of our stories and connecting with others (10 min + 5 min Q&amp;A)\n\nInnovator (20 min + 10 min Q&amp;A)\n\nNenad \u010canak (30 min + 15 min Q&amp;A)\n\nPresenting the project \u201cCreative Hub in Becej\u201d (10 min + 10 min Q&amp;A)\n\nOpen discussion about the project (until the workshop end)\n\n## Who is coming?\n\n### To confirm still\n\nSpeaker from the association of innovators, Serbia\n\nProf. Dr. Nikola \u010canak\n\n**Frequently asked questions**\n\n**How do I get an invitation/ticket to this workshop?**\n\n**How is this event being organised?**\n\nThis event, and the festival it is part of, is coordinated on the edgeryders platform (where you are now) and co-curated through a series of community video calls. We have allocated a collaboratively managed budget for the festival and operate on a solidarity basis. Participants who need some financial support to organise or be able to participate in the festival are eligible provided they contribute towards making it a meaningful and generative experience for all - in the run up to, during and/or after the event. If you would like to join us but are unsure as to how to contribute, don\u2019t worry. Create an [edgeryders account](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login), then [tell us a bit about yourself here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/tell-us-about-you) and we will guide you along from there.\n\n**Here the text needs to be individualised **for** your event!!!**\n\nWe @TamaraVuk  @jasen_lakic  and @noemi are coordinating this event, with http://www.than.rs/sr/, in collaboration with innova.rs, and high schools (not confirmed yet) \u201cEkonomska Skola Becej\u201d, \u201cGimnazija Becej\u201d, \u201cTehnicka skola Becej\u201d. Some people have been specially invited as guests because the work they are doing right now and their expertise will help ensure that the discussion is based on case studies, credible data and hands on experience.\n\n**How is this all financed?**\n\nThis project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 822682.\n\n**[POPREBEL_V01_BrightBlue.jpg4103\u00d7878 259 KB](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/3/31be5dc58dc3089277de7f5cb59f2cc5787a7b6f.jpeg)**\n\n**Does getting involved mean I endorse the funders views or actions?**\n\nNo. What you are doing is contributing to an open consultation on the topic of how to build a next generation of internet infrastructure, technologies, business models etc that promotes the wellbeing of humans and the natural environment. The consultation methodology is designed in such a way as to allow for diversity of views, premises, disciplines, themes and contexts. We employ open notebook science principles and the results will be presented in the form of a research report accessible to everyone after the event.

Can we build a strategic map for accessing spaces in Brussels? who to talk to? how to look for private/public ownership? what risks are being taken? who are the intermediaries?\n2.

If I can link that with the discussion going around at Saint-vide-leegbeek, I know for a fact that they are building the \"interoccupation\" between almost all actors of temporary space. But there are troubles due to the methodology used. On one side the more organized / systemized like Toestand and communa, on the other groups of people that are off grid (activist, newcomers, sans-papiers,...) That do it more the old fashioned way: entering and staying. Those two energies work sometimes against each other. \n2. That's what Community Land Trust is doing already for a decade. What could be interesting is to see if it's possible to create a bridge between those first steps of temporary use and buying something (that reminds me that for a second iteration of the reef you maybe should look at La Serre and what is going to happen with it, the commune is going to sell it and CLTB is checking if they can't buy it to keep the open space in the center but put appartements on both sides for permanent stay. )\n3. I think now it's time to scale up and bring all the experiences of all the organozation moving Brussels towards policy or alternative living. When you think about the way people who relatable to the 20th commune live, you see you have a cultural heterogeneous group of a new kind: no car, being really resourcefull on resources, recup and DIY, not a lot of private property.

So exciting that ER\u00a0is taking the initiative to build this new model of work and life!\u00a0\n\nHere are some of my reflections coming from my experience in sustainable tourism industry, managing an artist in residency program and a couple of co-working spaces in Yerevan, Armenia:\n\n- Please, check <a href=\"http://www.thebluehouse.io/#startup-getaway-morocco\">this successful startup</a> in Taghazout, Morocco and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@YallahAline/why-the-entrepreneur-life-made-me-miserable-and-why-i-m-putting-the-blue-house-on-hold-95cf1a6f06d#.non3mzg9r\">the reasons it closed down</a>.\n\n\u00a0- At <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nestevn/\">Nest AiR</a>\u00a0that I currently manage in Yerevan we have daily, weekly and monthly fees(the latter ones are the cheapest naturally) but we do accept guests free of charge in return of services(maintaining our website/garden, content writing, fundraising, etc). My suggestion would be to find a way to measure the contribution of the guests timewise(i.e. hours of work contributing to the project equals number of days of free accommodation) which would eliminate the risk of devaluation.\n\n\u00a0- @Nadia mentioned we need to focus on short term revenues, so in this case the above mentioned suggestion of remote membership when members pay ahead will work best imho. Leasing as suggested by @Alberto also makes sense when people paying monthly rent \u00a0eventually become owners.\n\n- Some ways of contributions that I could imagine for this space: childcare for the residents who are parents(kind of a homeschool), maintaining the space, administration, fundraising, cooking for the community, etc\n\nI myself not able to contribute financially am ready to offer in kind payment like managing the space, marketing/sales and some of the above-mentioned services.\n\nAnna\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-28 12:18:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:46.925068", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 348, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 1.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62574, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10634, "post_number": 27, "raw": "I would like to have a core team meeting as soon as @Matthias and @Ilaria arrive in Brussels to discuss progress and reporting.

Integrating them with schools and community centers, as done by OLE Nepal, seems good for their maintenance and longevity \u2013 in all, there is little need to pursue a Raspberry Pi version (the Kafal servers) just because they would be somewhat cheaper.\n\nThe current version of our concept is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gHLPjhueWLM0TzuQ7ah1iYN0ekVkku5_4XX3TyohrYM/\">Future Makers Academy</a>. Local offline servers would be one way to distribute the content, but far from the only one \u2013 see the last link for details. At first, we'd focus on creating the audio based courses, not on the tech infrastructure. Basically, a <a href=\"http://khanacademy.org/\">Khan Academy</a> for rural education, focusing on practical knowledge, not school content as in Khan Academy. If we can get this funded, we also have a team member interested to work on it in Nepal (she will be in Nepal anyway from this October for, I think, one year).

Some join in, actively listening, asking questions or giving thoughtful responses. (This is a safe place and not for debating opinions or speaking for others.)\n\nThe discussion begins with first hand accounts of attempts taken to solve societal issues and moves to navigating the personal challenges experienced by members. Nuances and the various different contexts surrounding these challenges begins to show.\n\n**Information analysis**\n\nNext open source technology is used to make connections between topics being discussed, the people discussing them, places, projects, solutions and struggles. When we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources.\n\nBy the end of the process, our community members have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n\n## What comes out of it\n\n|Inputs|Platform|Outputs|Outcome|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Good People|Conversation|Articles|Clusters of local actors that together try out new ideas to secure resilient livelihoods for their communities and themselves. Each cluster is composed of individuals, groups and organisations with deep ties to a place.|\n|Interesting stories|Sensemaking|New Projects|**How is a cluster different from a network?** In a network, participants look for how to make the most of what others are doing. In a cluster, participants are willing to re-orient their work, so as to better work with the other participants.|\n|Experience-based knowledge|New perspectives & ideas|Unlikely Alliances|If you are a construction company, you must not be lazy, and be open to using new technologies.

The event was great and I think we can definitely build on it for future \u2014 even if we don\u2019t get engagement on platform after, for example, the event itself was rich in material.", "created_at": "2020-04-20 08:11:10.855365", "updated_at": "2020-04-20 08:11:10.855365", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 116, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 21.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [74617], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33089, "user_id": 129, "topic_id": 3351, "post_number": 40, "raw": "<b>News from today </b>\n\n<span>Dear Noemi,</span>\n\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">thanks for the Info, I am very much looking forward to spending some time together in Matera.</div>\n\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">I tried to log in the Wiki a week ago, but didn\u2019t manage.</div>\n\n<div style=\"font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;\">I will arrive Friday, leaving Sunday and am looking for a place for two nights as part of a group of people sharing something.

My ability to understand courses, to analyze problems and come up quickly with solutions made me one of my professors\u2019 favorite students. I graduated with great ambitions, yet where to start? At that time, I had no clue. I followed my parents\u2019 recommendation joining one the finest preparatory institutes for engineering studies in Tunisia and an Engineering School after that to study Energy Engineering. After 2 years, I didn\u2019t see the value in it, and my grades were no longer as high as before. So I started my journey of discovering what I love.\n\nOne day, I joined a university club called enactus ENIM. Helping people in need, within it, starting ventures made me amazed! My devotion and my hard-working helped me become quickly the project manager of a green venture \"Tounes Tbaskel\" (Tunisia bikes). The project consisted on supporting a jobless father of three children, start a bikes renting agency, the first of its kind in Tunisia at that time. With a team of 12 members and a small budget of 5000$ that we have raised, we managed to implement the project successfully. Furthermore we have organized several events to promote the culture of biking and to raise the awareness of the environmental issues. Aside of being so proud, seeing the concept is starting to boom in Monastir nowadays, made me  realize that to make the world a better place to live in, demands only two things: hard work and a vision: you have to think globally and act locally, and in that way, only in that way your smallest deeds can make a positive change that would grow and impact positively the lives of people on a large scale.\nMy adventure did not stop there as I was always looking for new challenges and new projects, projects that would keep spreading good vibes in the city and among the youth. That is when I have succeeded to obtain a TEDx License after a long process of interviews and testing, to organize for the first time in my campus a TEDx event. I was and I am still a big fan of TED, as I believe in the power of ideas to change attitudes, to learn the importance of the sharing culture to achieve common goals and ensure a better future for our communities and ultimately the world.  So, I founded TEDxENIMonastir, and with a team of 30 members, we managed to organize a successful event that met with the attendees and all the guests' high expectations, who were inspired by the talks of our speakers who are some of the most influential leaders in different fields, in the country.  The success of this event made it possible to set a tradition to organize TEDx events later on, aiming to keep bringing on new ideas and spreading a culture of creativity, innovation, sharing and collaboration into the city of Monastir, a city that I believe has a great potential to become the African Silicon Valley considering the several similarities.\n\nGiving these achievements I was selected for SUSI for Student Leaders on Social Entrepreneurship program. The program, which took place at University of Connecticut in USA, aims to help develop global future leaders. I was selected by the U.S. Embassy officers in a highly competitive application process to join other student leaders from Africa. We spent 6 weeks learning about Social Entrepreneurship, Leadership and its different styles, project management, strategies to implement positive and long term social change, fundraising, Strategic Planning etc.\n\nAfter finishing the exchange program and my graduation, I knew that I was not meant to work as an energy engineer, not for the present moment at least. I was so passionate about social entrepreneurship, innovation and bringing on new ideas and projects that would lead to a positive change in my community. As you know, my beloved Tunisia is living today difficult times, threatening our democracy startup and troubling our freedom that we have fought for it during our revolution. To face these challenges, we must think anew and act anew.\n\nI believe the key solution is to lead new economic and education reforms, adopting new models based on entrepreneurship, innovation, technologies, and spreading creativity and collaboration spirit within youngsters. Tunisia, unfortunately has no natural resources. So we should focus more on our human resources and provide them with necessary support they need, to build a sustainable economy and a stronger nation. For all the above reasons, I proudly joined Enda inter-arabe, the largest microfinance institution in Tunisia and one of the top MFI around the world according to Forbes and MicroRate. Since 1990, Enda has supported more the 641.000 Tunisians, living in marginalized and rural areas with a particular focus on women, with micro-loans. These loans helped them to start micro-projects, generate some revenue and enhance their life conditions. It was all based on the principles and the vision set by Muhammad Yunus the Godfather of Microfinance. Yet, Enda has come to a conclusion, it is true that microloans provided have contributed significantly in improving lives of its beneficiaries and enabling them to better managing poverty, yet loans alone are not enough to help most of our clients escape poverty as they lacked the required set of skills to scale up their businesses.\n\nI joined Enda as Marketing Manager, and for two years, I have worked closely with the management team, Enda consultants and partners and the top management to develop different projects and new innovative approaches, to empower these underserved population, with a particular focus on women and youth, and provide them with the necessary support and accompaniment they need to sustain and grow their small businesses. With Enda, I was ensuring multidisciplinary tasks that included basically:\n\n* Contributing in developing youth oriented programs including training and incubation programs with Enda Training Committee, by sharing my experience and the new methodologies I have learned during my participation in SUSI program and iBDA acceleration program initiated by Yunus Social Business. \n* Developing and organizing tailored events to promote entrepreneurship among the youth like Business Speed Dating and Ideation Camps.\n* Managing communication campaigns and PR, by working closely with press and Media to ensure a better visibility on our projects and programs and drain more young people to sign up. I have also managed the digital marketing of Enda inter-arabe, by creating social media content on our Facebook page, supervising various data to track and evaluate continuously our digital communication , and finally identifying gaps and determining best next steps to maximize visibility.  \n* Identifying and Mobilizing new partners locally and internationally to further develop our programs and/or work on new projects having the same vision of empowering poor people by creating new opportunities for them. \n\n To conclude, I have developed during the past years, set of skills and expertise relative to development project management, events management, training and coaching (as I am  Certified Business Edge Trainer by the International Finance Cooperation IFC-World Bank Group), marketing and finally communication and digital marketing. I have also developed my network by meeting and working with some of the key actors in the Tunisian Ecosystem and abroad. I am at the beginning of my journey, yet I have gained remarkable skills that I will use to make difference in people lives and thrive a positive change in my beloved country, in the MENA region and in Africa.", "created_at": "2017-09-04 21:05:34.366817", "updated_at": "2017-09-09 14:44:58.778800", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1293, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 129.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3812, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38752, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 7567, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hi Alberto.

Some join in, actively listening, asking questions or giving thoughtful responses. (This is a safe place and not for debating opinions or speaking for others.)\n\nThe discussion begins with first hand accounts of attempts taken to solve societal issues and moves to navigating the personal challenges experienced by members. Nuances and the various different contexts surrounding these challenges begins to show.\n\n**Information analysis**\n\nNext open source technology is used to make connections between topics being discussed, the people discussing them, places, projects, solutions and struggles. When we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources.\n\nBy the end of the process, our community members have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n\n## What comes out of it\n\n|Inputs|Platform|Outputs|Outcome|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Good People|Conversation|Articles|Clusters of local actors that together try out new ideas to secure resilient livelihoods for their communities and themselves.

And remember - you will have to repeat the communication. Fast media = you'll miss or not really internalise it unless it is floating past you several times. \u00a0 The more time you are spending trying to engage one person, the lower the probability is that the invitation will reach the right people.\n\nSo what I usually do is that the focus on social media, large and broad.\n\nIn the event pages more specifically:\n\na) spread interesting, deep and relevant content that links back to the online space where we are interacting (in this case the\u00a0<a href=\"http://openandchange.care/\">http://openandchange.care</a>\u00a0process).

From the community perspective (eg the community around urban soil bioremediation that we'd like to build from Berlin), the online tools are an extension of the in-person meetings we will have locally. Perhaps a more distributed version of these meetings if our project grows beyond Berlin. This means the conversation there should be focussed on what's relevant and important for the community and their project. It's like an online meeting room. If the community keeps getting looped into other/meta conversations a good proportion of them will disengage. \n\nSo in my opinion each wet-lab community will need to be able to run their own suite of online tools, to support their own community (local organisational stuff, knowledge sharing, planning and reporting of experiments), in a way that is appropriate to that community. In my experience that's some form of the following:\n\n* chat (whatsapp, telegram, signal, SMS group etc) \u2013 mainly for the core team for time-sensitive communication\n* forum for non-time-sensitive parallel or threaded discussions (eg discourse, slack)\n* versionable documentation (wiki, github repo, google doc, even zines). \nSpecific choices about what platforms to use would depend on whatever is culturally appropriate for the local community. \n\nI think discourse is great for the forum solution, and I can see why it would make sense for the wider project to use the edgeryders instance. But, as @winnieponcelet  describes, our science hack day community started using a corner of the opentechschool discourse and I've had quite some problems with it that would make me think twice about doing it again (cap on the number of admins, onboarding challenges, confusion with the branding)... these are important issues that we'd have to resolve if we don't want the platform to be a barrier. It's not an issue of unwillingness to engage with online platforms - it's an issue of bandwidth and noise.\n\nMy main concern would be about control and longevity for communities that exist beyond the scope of this project. For example, we are also looking at other funding applications for the bioremediation project and intend for it to continue for quite some years to come. How longterm can a community expect to be able to continue on the edgeryders platform..? How much control does the community have over their content? Might there be the option to export the content if it needed to be re-homed elsewhere? Or would it be possible to set up wholly parallel instances of discourse but in such a way that edgeryders can still extract the data it needs for the ethno and econ research. \n\nBUT - I don't mean any of this to be negative.

Although this process is different for everyone, for each part of it there are similarities with someone, somewhere. To me it appears that a big part of the search is identifying pieces of your puzzle\u00a0in other people (eg. some advice)\u00a0and testing if it gets you closer to finishing your puzzle. That's where community comes in handy: a large group of people equals a lot of potentially useful pieces. The analogy is a simplification, but it helps me make sense of it.\n\nYou say\u00a0some people find the idea of a group therapy unsettling. I am one of those people. It's not the sharing with strangers or\u00a0the speaking up. I could even live with\u00a0the religious connotations, though I have a light allergy to most things that involve ritual. I think the reason is the lack of richness I experience in these group interactions. I find one on one conversations\u00a0or reading people's stories like yours\u00a0much more rewarding.\u00a0\n\nHowever, when I went through a darker period, it was also a group of people that helped me get out. It was a series of stories and great conversations, offline and online, one person at a time. Most of them will never meet each other.\n\nDefining what constitutes a community, a group, or what is just\u00a0collection of individuals that share a friend is not the point.\u00a0I guess you could say that the form the group or community takes differs for everyone. Or that the healing process is about meaningful interactions with others, however that may work for you.

We don't want to pay for all of them, as that would quickly become expensive:\n\n> Drive Enterprise Pricing: $8.00 per active user per month. An \u201cActive User\u201d signs in to Drive Enterprise at least once during the month or has had data synchronized to/from Drive Enterprise at least once during the Fee Accrual Period*. ([source](https://cloud.google.com/drive-enterprise/))\n\nSo instead, there is a nice \"loophole\". Actions on files (viewing, downloading, editing) are not charged when done by users outside of the Google Drive Enterprise domain (edgeryders.eu in our case):\n\n> Some user actions don\u2019t trigger an active user charge. These uncharged activities include [\u2026] Accessing of files by users outside of your domain ([source](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9032846))\n\nIt is not clear from that what \"accessing\" means: only viewing, or also editing? Also, what about creating files by members outside of the organization which have been added as members to a Team Drive?\n\nI made some quick tests by adding my non-edgeryders.eu Google Account and looked at \"Billing\" in the [Admin console](https://admin.google.com/). Nothing changed. Also the \"Activities in last 7 days: 6 Active users\" counter on the Admin console sidebar did not change (and that's probably using the same \"active users\" calculation as \"monthly active users\" in billing. So indeed it seems we're only ever charged for activities with users having an `\u2026@edgeryders.eu` Google Account. Also the \"Reducing users and cancellation\" instructions [here at the bottom](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9032846) only talk about managing the `\u2026@edgeryders.eu` Google Drive Enterprise users, confirming that users outside of the organization's domain just don't matter for billing.\n\nAnd I could not yet find a drawback of adding people with Google Accounts outside our domain (means, not ending in `\u2026@edgeryders.eu`) to the Team Drives. According to my tests, they can be given all the permissions as other members, and files they create can be removed by Team Drive admin users, and they will lose access to their own files when their Team Drive member status is removed. That's all the control we need to prevent people from doing damage to our files. (I did not yet test if their files can be transferred to other owners, but probably yes. And if not, we can still copy them and delete the original, while the original owner can't do damage if we exclude their access first.)\n\nSo an economic proposal for account management will be this:\n\n* Give Edgeryders Directors a Google Drive Enterprise account (means, a Google account for an address ending in `\u2026@edgeryders.eu`).

I think this is a topic closely related to the issues @JollyOrc talks about [here in this post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/social-media-is-broken-lets-do-better/10017) and in [our podcast](https://edgeryders.eu/t/podcast-recording-of-our-community-call-with-christian-buggedei-august-6-2019/10588).  \n\n<br>\n\n# Iranian politics, white guy editors test Wikipedia\u2019s high-minded mission\nWhen you search for my husband\u2019s last name, the only Google results are links to an opera singer with the same name. But for a brief moment in time, a few years ago, his family name was listed in Wikipedia\u2019s category: \u201cRoyalty of Georgia (country).\u201d His family isn\u2019t royal, and never has been. Presumably out of boredom, my husband edited the wiki entry and inserted his last name. It stayed up for months. And when it was deleted, he changed it back. This time, it only stayed up for a couple of hours.\n\nMy husband\u2019s edit was inconsequential. But not all edits on Wikipedia are as trivial as his.\n\n[Sina Zekavat describes in his piece for OpenDemocracy](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/north-africa-west-asia/persian-wikipedia-independent-source-or-tool-iranian-state/) how he found major differences between pages on Iranian events, the country\u2019s history and politics in English and in Persian. Content in English gives much more nuanced context, often with hundreds of verified sources; the Persian versions read like rote pro-government propaganda with dead links and footnotes to government-sponsored news outlets. \n\nTo #stayonthestory of the disinformation crisis, subscribe to our Disinformation Matters newsletter \n\nIn  2007, Wikipedia Founder Jimmy Wales praised an Iranian contributor for his defiance ([see his video for Amnesty International on free speech here](https://youtu.be/0suY1pMJN08?t=84)). But the Iranian Ministry of Culture \u2014 which is responsible for the country\u2019s \u201cmedia management\u201d \u2014 seems to work together with the non-profit Persian Wikipedia organization, and now there are talks to incorporate it into its ministry as an affiliated NGO.\n\n\u201cRegistering Persian Wikipedia as a so called Non Governmental Organization in a state institution that is in charge of the country\u2019s censorship apparatus can only be described as an Orwellian event,\u201d Zekavat wrote in his article.\n\n### **Wikipedia Matters**\n\nI know that I\u2019m not alone in venturing onto Wikipedia to quickly resolve a heated debate in a bar, like [whether the heart of a shrimp is \u201creally\u201d located in its head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean).

In [an excellent Buzzfeed article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/wikipedia-ban-editor-culture-war) worth your time, on the fury surrounding Wikipedia\u2019s removal of a volunteer site administrator, Joseph Berstein explains that \u201cas existential concerns about Wikipedia\u2019s accuracy have faded into the background, demography has emerged as the most serious threat to the project\u2019s legitimacy; it can hardly aspire to be the sum of human knowledge if only white guys create and manage it.\u201d He cites the platform\u2019s pornographic actress list as recently as 2015 had more edits and editors than its list of female poets. A 2017 study found that 77% of Wikipedia articles are written by 1% of its users.\n\nWikipedia was always a utopian project \u2014 volunteer labor, the sum of human knowledge captured and democratized, etc. But that doesn\u2019t mean the hijacking of the Persian language Wikipedia into Iran\u2019s censorship apparatus is inevitable.

Some join in, actively listening, asking questions or giving thoughtful responses. (This is a safe place and not for debating opinions or speaking for others.)\n\nThe discussion begins with first hand accounts of attempts taken to solve societal issues and moves to navigating the personal challenges experienced by members. Nuances and the various different contexts surrounding these challenges begins to show.\n\n**Information analysis**\n\nNext open source technology is used to make connections between topics being discussed, the people discussing them, places, projects, solutions and struggles. When we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources.\n\nBy the end of the process, our community members have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n\n## What comes out of it\n\n|Inputs|Platform|Outputs|Outcome|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Good People|Conversation|Articles|Clusters of local actors that together try out new ideas to secure resilient livelihoods for their communities and themselves.

It would be sustainably run and owned by the local community, and it would leave as a legacy an open source server that would provide community services, and as a platform for learning technology.\n\n<span>Here in Matera, we would leave a digital platform that would include open data from the various mapping related projects (transport, unGuides, resource mapping) and include some simple well supported open source tools (for instance Loomio for participatory decision making, Share Tribe for tool sharing and a local artisan network, a shared calendar and yellow pages style address book). Importantly it would include simple and robust WordPress hosting for local community projects and small B&amp;B's together with Room Booking plugins.</span>\n\n<span>The server would be financially supported and owned by the local community (B&amp;B's could pay a nominal \u20ac10 a year for instance), and it would also act as a platform for physical Open Tech School courses, supported by an ongoing online training programme provided by the Viral Academy. The latter my require the additional cost of providing a development server.</span>\n\n<span>In September Edgeryders is supposed to build a European event on community-owned digital assets in Matera back-to-back with OSMIT14, and the Italian OpenStreetMap community's meetup. There is a great opportunity for synergy here - as mentioned by @Alberto. @Elf-pavlik has also done previous <a href=\"https://github.com/elevate-festival/dspace-app-action-slim\">mapping-party workshops,</a> and the work I've been doing here based on a previous distributed festival.</span>\n\n<span>It would be great to have some technical input and suggestions from the EdgeRyders community regarding existing software tools that we could use as an initial basis, and to link closely with an ongoing programme of training and software development facilitated by the online Viral Academy project, and the physical location based Open Tech Schools.</span>\n\n<span>Finally, this open source server could evolve into the\u00a0<a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/replicating-unmonastery-pattern-languages-and-unmonastery-in-a-box\">unMonastery-in-a-box</a> proposal developed in LOTE3. in the context of Matera, it would be good to follow up this post with a discussion of art and culture related projects that could take part in this event to make it a genuine celebration of Open Culture.</span>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bdeb5645045d6e95dbe979403a25de806c6c12ca.jpeg\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\">\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-16 18:35:56", "updated_at": "2017-10-08 21:18:42.663999", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 541, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 65.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56935, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10385, "post_number": 2, "raw": "So, I joined Edgeryders a while ago, to become active in a project related to the country I live in ([Futurespotters in Georgia](https://edgeryders.eu/c/workspaces/spot-the-future-georgia)). \n\nI recently got active again on the platform because of the IOH project, when I was tagged in a post for the work I do with Coda Story.\n\n- _what motivates me to join?_ an inspiring community who is looking to find solutions for a better world\n- _what motivates me to participate?_ interesting people and discussions on topics that matter to me (freedom of information, participatory decision-making, privacy - beyond our own western world)\n- _What do you search, find and offer on the Internet of Humans Edgeryder community?_ I search for conversation that make me help figure out how we can have  better online experience\n- _How do/would you explain the platform to newcomers?_ THE BIG QUESTION :) \n\nThanks for helping me craft the right message.

In fact, the book ends on a warning:\n\n> this rhetoric does work in the world. It sets agendas, influences perceptions of what it means to be \"advanced,\" recalibrates norms and guides the allocation of resources. Proliferated across the network without end or limit, we can see it filling an entire space of sociotechnical possibility with the airless hegemony of a single bad idea that no one has the time or energy to fight, least of all the citizens whose lives will wind up conditioned by it.\n\nWhat he *does* deny is that the smart city concept (not the IoT, though the two are connected) makes any kind of sense. He takes it apart with the tools of urban planning. He does such a good job that that concept has become just... untouchable, for any self-respecting person. As far as I am concerned, what matters about his position is not whether it is old, but whether it is right, and I believe it is. I am not even making only an academic point. I am being pragmatic, just like you say, because facts are unyielding, and a big weapon to fight the smart city ideology is that, in practice, it does not work. \n\nThis is why, in this debate here, I am looking for technological facts to buttress visions and political positions. Pushing a vision through is always hard (your document is a clear witness of this).

Do not duplicate them or compete with them.\n\n* **Foster maximal diversity to attack systemic problems.** We now know diversity trumps ability.\n\n* **Improve ability to analyse and interpret information.** Produce and use data. Have a data strategy.\n\nJoining this community means collaborating with, inspiring and learning from a diverse group of people from every corner of the globe.\n\nAs an active participant, you develop new skills and learn with your peers how to connect direct impact and systems change.\n\n## Getting started is easy!\n\n1. **Create an account!** Just click \"Sign Up\" in the top right.

Envelopes will be delivered in 5 times in 5 different locations of the city. Every team will testify the accomplishment of the tasks through the use of a sport camera (GoPro) and their own mobile devices (we could use WhatsApp or Telegram to collect all the materials).\n\n**Duration and timing**\n The experience will last for a total of 4 hours, divided as the following: Intro > rules, team creation, tools test > 30 minutes Game > 5 envelopes in 5 different locations > 2.30 hours (one envelope every 30 minute) Closing > Chill out time, mission\u2019s review, prize moment, 45 minutes It must to be considered at least a 15 minutes delay gap.\n\n**Urban Route**\n In order to fit the Open Village format, the game could start in the location of the Festival (the easiest way to have all the participants ready to go), and finish at a dinner location or a pub, where the player could have the opportunity to interact, share stories and chill out. The Open Village location could also be a great ending locations, players could leave their things there and play more freely, and we will then explore the surroundings of the area.\nUsually checkpoint are located at 15 to 20 minutes walking distance and connected with path that could cross public spaces, parks or pedestrian areas.\n\n**Name**\nIncognito Battleclash is not exactly in line with the goal that we want to reach, so maybe could be cool to come up with a different name? \n\n**Tasks** \nThe tasks design will be based on the Open Village contents in order to achieve a tasks-list of 25 missions, divided between the 5 envelopes and organized in a crescendo.\nHealth, citizen science, care, body fitness will be mixed with funny and interactive tasks, to involve also passer-by and citizens.\n\n**Output**\nWe will have a massive amount of video/pictures and other player generated materials that could be helpful to describe and share the topics of the Festivals.\n\n___\n\n**BIG OPEN QUESTION**\nThe tasks/creative missions are the core of the game, and could lead the experience in one or in the other direction (simple fun vs serious game).\n\nThen probably the best way to understand that is starting throwing ideas about the tasks lists and see how far or how close we are from the Festival topics.\n\n**OPEN QUESTION**\nIncognito Battleclash is an already tested format (we did it in Roma few month ago with 50 people), but we can also imagine something more complex (single urban games in the different Checkpoints?).", "created_at": "2017-08-04 16:48:12.215101", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 14:05:35.380976", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 861, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 411.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3769, 3362, 3729], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64027, "user_id": 5252, "topic_id": 10674, "post_number": 40, "raw": "Hello Edgeryders\n\nRalu thank you so much for joining on board and generating relevant information\n\nFR\nJe te remercie d'avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 notre premier atelier de la communaut\u00e9 du Reef.

I relay here some things I learned from a web series hosted a few weeks ago by the Ellen MarArthur Foundation - a global charity supporting the acceleration to a circular economy. \n\n## 'The covid19 crisis has shown us we have a greater need than ever to create a distributed, diverse and regenerative food system'\n\n![Capture2.PNG|690x307](upload://s7YGGME7RpuRlRCrXsswAlue8I4.jpeg) \n*Screenshot from [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIAf83wF-TY)*\n\n## Context\n\nIn the current linear economy, our food system is extractive and damaging to the environment by endless depletion. The Foundation calculated that for every 1 dollar that we spend on food, there's an equivalent of 2 dollars of negative environmental and health impacts, tied to the way we produce and consume food: air quality, antimicrobial resistance, health impact to farmers, and obesity, malnutrition effects on consumers.\n\nPerhaps more than any other units, cities are key players for transformation: 68% of the world's population will live in them by 2050, consuming 80% of the world's food. Cities have evolved to work with high distance supply chains. Colonization and the discovery of corn and sugar brought about food systems that are translocal, with severe transformations of the countrysides from suppliers of the city into a marginal economic source.\n\nThe urban paradox: we like to talk about ourselves as urban, but we need resources that live in the natural world, which means that **the urban identity is only a context we have created,** whereas we've forgotten about our real source of life and how good governance, the responsibility of feeding people needs to take into account the real landscape in which we exist - urban and rural. In addition, carbon zero lifestyles means people need to have access to the rural economy as much as the urban economy.\n\n## How do you maximize the urban/rural interface?\n\nI found it interesting that 'the close proximity of citizens, retailers, and service providers (40% of cropland is within 20km of cities) makes new circuits possible.' For food businesses, this means to use regenerative practices for cultivating animal or vegetable products; source, design, market as much healthy, local and seasonal food as possible, and avoid waste.\n\n- **tapping into the latent fertility present in many cities.** We now have the opportunity to question the existing trajectory. We notice how spending time at home and cooking from scratch, or connecting with local producers can be very rewarding. The focus here is greening the cities, supporting communities to create more territorial systems, like backyard urban gardens for example.\n- **reorganising land:** We need to learn to work with small pieces of land because it's extremely difficult to actually get access to land and farm it in cities; In the rural side, producers are struggling economically, with draught etc. and their kids are becoming engineers in cities, so increasing capacity around working land is important.\n-  **reconstruction of the networks.** Example: build on creativity burst in restaurants reinventing how to sell food, local farmers accessing new markets. In Quebec, an organisation called Table du Chef which started to recover food waste, when the covid19 came, the chefs got together and started producing massive quantities of quality food to distribute 2 million meals inside the city, through a 'cuisine solidaire', using abandoned fancy hotel kitchens to cook. In Brussels and other cities we have seen similar [partnerships](https://edgeryders.eu/t/learning-from-the-brussels-food-ecosystem-how-can-communities-keep-working-together/13796) between restaurants and local farmers.  \n\n## The role of chefs, food designers and food service companies in the transition to a circular economy\n\nRestaurants and food services in particular influence what people eat, especially given that people are eating out more and more (90% of people in some Asian countries eat out every day!). So they have a lot of capacity for transformation. What's more, the tendency (in high cuisine I think!) is for chefs to become micro-regional chefs, rediscovering and connecting back to ancient foods and recipes. Fermentation is a good example of knowledge that has been distilled by generations, yet it is only now becoming trendy. \n\nThe practices presented were: \n* build new stories around uncommon foods in urban diets, i.e. indigenous food crops, lesser known types of grains;  'When you taste biodiversity, there is a new meaning'; \n* play on the health benefits of local foods as opposed to heavily processed supermarket foods \n* promote how farmers' livelihoods depend on this local food consumption, because often these ingredients come from subsistence farming; \n* use wasted products to uncover new ingredients from unexpected sources of 'deliciousness' i.e. fishbones, roots and leaves not traditionally eaten; leftover sunflower seeds to make cheese (!)\n\nSome project ideas which now make the rounds of what constitutes circular food:\n\n- ready meal services that use only food surpluses \n- meat replacements: using mushrooms in burger patties, bean curd ('yuba') to mimic chicken skins\n- packaging using by-products from i.e. pasta production \n- .. many more! There are different food competitions, including one by [Thought for Food](https://thoughtforfood.org/content-hub/tff-partners-with-food-lab-accelerator-at-google-flag/) supported by the MarcArthur Foundation, but it remains to be seen how new companies will put the innovations in service of positive impact. \n\nA final section of the series was dedicated to regenerative practices and how we could be using urban organic wasteflows for production purposes after. I skipped it, but the video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5Z02bNdpmU&list=PLXT_ozykGVakKaiQzofTeT1liqfyZGrnk&index=5), if anyone is interested.\n\nThis all seems too good - I was disappointed to see that challenges to make this transition were not discussed.. and we sure know there are many, including for the very [survival of good food entrepreneurs and projects](https://edgeryders.eu/t/after-covid19-while-food-businesses-are-failing-can-community-oriented-food-projects-be-the-way-forward/13409)!\n## If any of these is relevant to you, I'd be curious to learn how are you involved in your city transformation?

We can also discuss the possibility of letting the chat unfold as it unfolds, naturally, as people may be more comfortable talking in chat form than speaking. As a result, be really careful with the direct callouts to individuals \u2013 it puts people who might not want to talk on the spot. Perhaps it would be best to only ask chat questions aloud if they are direct questions on the topic that is being discussed in voice \u2013 clarification questions, follow-up questions, etc. One of the great benefits of digital calls is that those who would not be comfortable speaking up in an in-person event might feel comfortable sharing their views textually \u2013 we have to be sure to leave room for this.\n\nI would try to keep the voice conversation as one-pointed and moving naturally from topic to topic as I could while letting the chat be more free form. Chats always take on a life of their own anyway, and each person views it sort of differently.  For some it is a way of saying something they regard as a more minor point. For others the way to introduce a link. For others a way to bring tangents into the picture without derailing the vocal conversation.  And for still others a way to comment on how the voice action is going or to point out info about muting and audio quality.  So I would accept that it's going to be more diffuse.\n\nSome will talk and some will only use the chat. I didn't talk voice in the conversation because I thought it more important to hear the others.  But I did make a couple of small points in the chat.\n\nI think it is advisable to remind people to look at the chat even if they are otherwise 90% focused on the talk, because the moderator can send a private message without interrupting.

Product design template (Deliverable 1)\n5. Sales presentation (Deliverable 2)\n6. A plan of action with detailed budget to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) (Deliverable 3).\n7. Optional but appreciated: The Url to a A 1-2 min video in which the team present their idea. This is optional, but teams are highly encouraged to do it as it will help OCI Lab team and invited experts in making final evaluation.\n\n***After the hackathon: **reviewing and announcing results*****\n\n1. Participants are encouraged to read one another\u2019s posts, post questions to their peers, and respond to questions from the others, to give constructive feedback.\n2. The OCI Lab team and Hackathons' organizers will:\n   * Read through the presentation post of the project proposals, and into their deliverables and post comments with some follow up questions to collect information needed from each one\n   * Propose some team constellations of people when relevant who can work well together moving forward\n   * Shortlist the best teams for inclusion in the next phases of the OCI Lab process and do a due diligence check on them\n   * The shortlisted teams will have fixed appointments to attend community calls with Edgeryders\u2019 team and volunteering mentors from different fields. The purpose of these calls is to to support teams in further developing their project ideas by sharing with them insights, knowledge and tools. Through these calls, participants will get to know the online platform run by Edgeryders, where all community members support each other by sharing advice, resources and opportunities, and most of all through the power of collective intelligence.\n   * The final selection of candidates will be made based on a holistic evaluation of the teams, of the project presentation, how people responded to input from peers and experts, the scorecarding of the project itself. Evaluation will take in consideration: **Feasibility of the project and the plan of action**, **Relevance of the environmental issue**, **Team (Competencies and reactivity on platform)**, **Innovation** and **Scalability** \n\nThe announcement of results will be made on the platform. Selected teams from all Hackathons, will be notified. they will be contacted later by OCI Lab team to get more details on the next steps.\n\nFrom each Hackathon, we should have:\n\n* *First and Second projects selected by Edgeryders\u2019 team: Access to OCI Lab to benefit from its online incubation program and from an access to a budget up to 15k $, which will be made available to support all selected projects from the MENA region for MVPs development purposes in accordance with the OCI Lab's rules, selection criteria and due diligence process.*\n* *Third and Fourth projects: Access to OCI Lab to benefit from their online incubation program.*\n\n**Q/A:** \nIf you have any questions about  the Hackathons' process, please do not hesitate to post your question here, or to go to the specific event in your city and post it there. @nadia , Edgeryders' team, local organizers and I would be more than happy to answer them :)  \n\n\n**Links for the calls:** \nThanks to the efforts and reactivity of @MariaEuler , we have now the links for the different calls:  \n* On Friday 22/11 at 3pm CET with @nadia for 40min (Q/A session regarding Edgeryders, MENA YP and OCI Lab)\n zoom room ID: https://zoom.us/j/607188025\n\n* On Friday 22/11 at 6pm CET with Suzanna (@nadia is confirming the time)\n zoom room ID: https://zoom.us/j/125173479\n\n* On Saturday 23/11 at 3pm CET with @matteo_uguzzoni for 1-2 hours\n zoom room ID: https://zoom.us/j/119745644\n\n\n**Useful websites and materials:** \n\n https://s3.amazonaws.com/sustainabledevelopment.report/2019/2019_sustainable_development_report.pdf\n\nhttps://dashboards.sdgindex.org/#/\n\nhttp://www.sdgsdashboard.org/", "created_at": "2019-11-20 23:38:46.544672", "updated_at": "2019-11-21 22:02:13.490986", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1347, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 325.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61835, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11202, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Ping @BlackForestBoi, @soenke, @erik_lonroth,  @AskaBednarczyk, @kuba_svehla,@zalesjan, @TamaraVuk,@jasen_lakic, @mrchrisadams, @zelf, @natalia_skoczylas", "created_at": "2019-10-21 13:49:14.589700", "updated_at": "2019-10-21 13:49:14.589700", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 23.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5040], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62756, "user_id": 4272, "topic_id": 11333, "post_number": 3, "raw": "[quote=\"amelia, post:1, topic:11333\"]\nBased on ideas from a contact of Hugi\u2019s, we also discussed the possibility of conference SSNA\u2014 a SSNA that analyses the interests of conference attendees before they arrive, and shows them a map of their interests and connections with each other once they get there.

Consider it an offline conversation starter for the online conversation here. :) \n\n\n## Background\n\nOn Saturday, 2019-11-23 we will hold a workshop to explore the tech aspects of green urban living as intended by The Reef project, and of converting buildings for green living. It will take the form of a brainstorming session with two experts: Bernardo from [Mama Brussels](http://mama.brussels/office.html), an architect working about \"building maintenance as architecture\"; and Michele from [Superlab Engineering](https://superlab-engineering.org/site/), which is a deluxe makerspace made with refurbished industrial machinery. (For those interested in the workshop itself: [see here](https://thereef.brussels/events/#nov23).)\n\nHere, you can add any question you have for the workshop participants about topic of technology of green urban living. I'm adding some example questions as a starting point. As a general point, focus on questions that you need an expert for, not simply an Internet search engine. Otherwise, anything goes.\n\nAnyone on the edgeryders.eu forum is welcome to add their questions. It does not matter if you will be at the event or not \u2013 all answers will be posted online afterwards. As this is a brainstormimg session, expect answers to be quick pointers by our experts, pointing you into the right direction to explore further (tools, techniques, publications, organizations etc.). Also expect that for some questions, we won't have an ad-hoc answer, and that's ok. Lateron, our experts will hopefully join us here on the forum to continue the discussion, but for now, the questions and the workshop format is what we'll focus on.\n\n\n## For starters: my questions\n\n**1. The Calafou broken roof**\n\n![cropped|690x690](upload://68mr6A4k1c5jV23Oj2PxQGKQz7A.jpeg) \n\n[The picture](https://calafou.org/sites/calafou.org/files/20130511_0051.jpg) shows an industrial complex in the countryside near Barcelona, built in ~1900. The roof of the central warehouse / manufacturing building burned around 2005 and collapsed. The lower story is already in use (by [Calafou](https://calafou.org/), a \"post-capitalist, eco-industrial commune\"). What would be architectural ideas for putting this building back to use for a communal living scenario? Preferably with not much monetary investment, nice final looks, and DIY work. Assume the walls are still good to be salvaged / repaired. Note, the building does not necessarily get its roof back. It just should be useful again for a communally living group.\n\n\n**2. Natural building in Belgium**\n\nWhat would be a the right approach to build with unusual, natural building materials in Brussels? \"Right\" as in, as little friction and time loss dealing with \"authorities\" as possible. Assume a material that is not yet certified on a national level for use in residential buildings. For example, that may apply to strawbale insulated wooden buildings. Unusual or extreme solutions welcome.\n\n\n**3. Recycling insulation**\n\nWe would like to re-use insulation materials for adding to the building during the \"green conversion\", to reduce the embodied energy and emissions of the building. These can come from any suitable waste streams, for example glass wool and styrofoam from old buildings, PU foam from broken fridges etc.. What would be good ideas for materials to use, and sources for them in Brussels? What would be DIY-friendly techniques to re-use or recycle them?\n\n\n**4. Approaching building maintenance**\n\nWhen you approach a major job of building maintenance / refurbishment, what are your basic steps and priorities of approaching such a a project? What are mistakes you try to avoid? Assume the budget is a constraint.\n\n\n**5. Eco-friendly furniture system**\n\nWe are looking for a DIY-producable, ecologically sustainable furniture system. It should be simple furniture that uses open source designs, simple enough to create the designs ourselves. It should use local materials and be DIY repairable.\n\nWe are looking for a material and processing technique that suits such a furniture. Any tips for us? Example answers, open for comments: locally grown bamboo, joined with glue (\"technical timber\" fashion), weaving, and 3D printed adapter parts. Or: cardboard furniture, cut with a large 2D CNC machine.\n\n\n**6. Architectural uses of second-hand PV panels**\n\nPV panels are becoming a part of the waste stream \u2013 they are very cheap that way, and with the right converters can still produce power. This should allow new applications as a long-lasting building material with a certain aesthetic. What would be architectural ideas for such uses during a green building conversion project?\n\n\n**7. Hiding piping and wiring**\n\nA challenge when converting an existing building is to keep the interior visually attractive even when installing a lot of new wiring and piping (solar, ventilation for heat exchangers, floor heating, low-voltage DC lines etc.).\n\nWhat are architectural ideas to make these elements visually attractive, or to make them disappear? Quick and DIY solutions welcome. Extreme and unconventional solutions very welcome.\n\n\n**8. Resource waste in urban living**\n\nFrom your perspective and experience, what are the neglected major ways in which urban living in Brussels wastes resources? Especially electricity, heating energy, water, embodied energy and embodied emissions.\n\n\n**9. Indoor thermal mass**\n\nIn a low-thermal-mass building (read: the PU insulated box body of my truck), I made the experience that the furniture and equipment *inside* provides a good amount of thermal mass that buffers heat, preventing temperatures from becoming too high during hot summer days.\n\nIf we want to use this in refurbished buildings, large amounts of water placed indoors would be suitable, preferably with a high surface area and good, passive heat transfer between air and water.\n\nWhat are architectural ideas how to integrate that water into the indoor living environment?\n\n\n**10. Building for DIY maintenance**\n\nWhat are the major things that absolutely cannot be DIY maintained or repaired in modern \"eco-friendly\" buildins? And what are DIY friendly alternatives for that?\n\n\n**11. How to transform a building while living inside?**\n\nTo have quick feedback about the usefulness of a \"green building innovation\", we want to test them and see them as they are built, and change them where needed. Also for economic reasons, we will need to live in (parts of) the building while transforming it.\n\nTransformation is a bit like building maintenance, just more extreme, as more gets changed. Still, any lessons for how maintenance and occupation for living purposes get along properly will help to integrate this.\n\n\n**12. Beautiful edible wilderness**\n\nOne of the most ecologically destructive and also most ugly parts of urban housing is front or back lawns, nicely trimmed but dead. People seem to not like wild nature. But if done right (permaculture), it's both edible and low-maintenance.\n\nWhat are architectural and design ideas to integrate natural wilderness in the outdoor areas? How to deal with the little annoyance that people usually cite as reasons not to have wilderness (stinging insects, mosquitoes, mice / rats, ranking plants and roots destroying walls etc.).\n\n\n**13. Where to accumulate soil?**\n\nSince full food self-supply is not realistic in urban settings, food will be bought, and the residues will be composted. Over years and decades, this will create a lot of soil through on-site composting. In addition, a lot of paper and cardboard can also be composted, and will only add to this.\n\nWhat are architectural ideas to integrate this soil into the building in an incremental, ecologically beneficial and optically pleasing way? Because why transport something away when it can be of use locally.\n\n\n**14. Low-tech styrofoam remanufacturing**\n\nStyrofoam is great for insulation and currently most of it is just discarded when this type of insulation is removed. How can it be re-used or re-manufactured as building insulation in an efficient, DIY friendly way? Also, can other styrofoam items like packaging pieces etc. be used as input materials for that as well?\n\n\n**15. Are there limits for insulation?**\n\nAre there any physics related limits to the amount of insulation that makes sense to use? Assume that space consumption is not an issue at all. Then what would speak against 5 m thick walls of re-used styrofoam?", "created_at": "2019-11-20 12:16:51.875162", "updated_at": "2019-11-24 10:40:05.254524", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1399, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 90.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88544, "user_id": 6756, "topic_id": 15075, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Consider this as a thought experiment, or a dream experiment as this one came in a dream.\n\nStock market is the cornerstone of capitalism. Right from the times when Europeans set sail to the foreign and utterly alien shores of India & America, the concept of joint-stock ownership made the venture of mass-exploitation possible. Today, stock market drives efficiency, rewards innovators and ensures that the companies are on a growth curve and are profitable. Organizations hire & fire people, they acquire companies or shed weight, go after newer horizons or focus on their core \u2013 they do everything as per the diktats of the market in their single-minded pursuit of increasing shareholder value.\n\nAfter the cold war, Russian-branded socialism was no longer hip. Capitalism had once and for all trumped Russia\u2019s \u2018All men are equal, but some are more equal than the others\u2019 funda. There were gross inefficiencies in the process, people starved and were indigent in general, and one look at the cultural & economic divide between East- & West-Germany told us quite emphatically which model worked better.\n\nSocialists shirk away from stock markets, as they see it as a capitalist tool to deepen the gap between the rich and the poor. But what if they had their own market economics to improve efficiencies of their processes, a market system that eventually converted everything into commodities, made things more equal as per their viewpoint? What if they had a system that exactly matched their ethos?\n\nSo here goes.\n\nIt is somewhat similar to commodities market, but not quite. Consider a system that traded everything on the bourses \u2013 steel, apple, coffee beans, house, movie \u2013 everything! Each and every ingredient, raw material & finished good at an indexed price being sold on the market. And there is an avenue in which you can transform one thing into another.\n\nConsider a simple example.\n\nTo make steel - you require iron ore, coke & limestone. Say all four of them traded just like in a commodities exchange. Say the price of 1 unit of iron ore was 30, of coke 5, limestone 5 & steel 50. For the sake of simplicity consider that to make 1 unit of steel, you require 1 unit of iron ore, limestone and coke each. Now comes the fun part \u2013 if I own 1 unit of iron ore, limestone & coke each, I can transform my shares in the raw material to finished goods. There is a magic convertor out there, which converts my raw material stocks into 1 unit of steel. Hence the arbitrage is of 50 \u2013 (30 + 5 + 5) = 10. I make a profit of 10, if I were to buy RM stocks, transform them into Finished goods, and sell the same.\n\nAdd a bit more complexity here. There are varieties of iron ores out there, and a lot many grades of steel that can be produced. Hence the difference in value may vary more or less. Instead of companies being listed on the stock market, in a socialist regime \u2013 the products themselves would be listed. Please note that the number of shares/units and the price would be linked to the actual goods or inventory. Hence the fluctuation in the price of units would depend not just on the supply/demand of those units, but also on the supply/demand of the actual goods. Also our magic convertor would have a basis in ground reality, so 1 unit each of iron ore, coke and limestone will not yield 1 unit of unicorn! It would only yield what is technically feasible, possible and what is actually done in the manufacturing units.\n\nWhy do this? What\u2019s the purpose of trying to mirror manufacturing when you can actually manufacture? Where does the trading part come from?\n\nThe best way to trade is through Futures contract. It entails all the benefit of a commodity exchange: it is highly liquid, it has leveraged investments, and it increases the overall transparency. In socialism, one of the main issues is corruption \u2013 there is no free market, and hence very limited transparency as everything is state-driven. Vested powers can take ad-hoc decisions to line their pockets which leads to gross inefficiencies, behemoth PSUs that can\u2019t take off the ground and are leaden with debt, and delivery of subpar goods and services. Furthermore, as this reduces information asymmetry \u2013 a trader would try to buy the cheapest raw material units and sell off the finished goods at the highest price. Plus as there is a time pressure in a futures\u2019 contract, there would be added pressure to manufacture faster and reduce the lead times for delivery. It would ensure that the things don\u2019t move at a meandering pace.\n\nSo a Commodities\u2019 exchange kind of a market, with that magic convertor can improve the overall efficiencies of the underlying machinery. An impersonal state earns and loses the money in the market, there is no single individual entity or private company that is responsible to drive shareholder value \u2013 which in this case would be the state itself.\n\nBut such an exchange would kill brands. When the ethos of a community is group over an individual, when one must strive to be the part of a whole instead of being different \u2013 distinctive brands would not exist. Everything is treated as a commodity; nothing is unique or different. An example would serve our purpose, say we trade an iPhone on such an exchange. Initially, the arbitrage between the raw materials and the finished goods would be huge considering the price of an iPhone (1000 X) as compared to the raw materials used (100 X). Traders would rush in for buying the raw materials and trying to convert everything into an iPhone. This may artificially inflate the raw material prices for short-term. Suddenly, there would be a supply glut of iPhones. Lot many would get made. In the long term, this would drive down the prices of the finished product, killing all the brand power such a phone possessed. Brand would stop being a differential for price.\n\nIn absence of competition or driving force of greed to earn more, it would, in the end, kill innovation. New technologies would stop being developed. Such a society would perfect the art of making round wheels in the cheapest and fastest way possible, but they would never take off to the air.\n\nIndia is a mixed economy. It still has areas and avenues where state has absolute control \u2013 can we introduce such a system to improve the efficiencies of the PSUs that we have, of the state-machinery itself? The auctions had already improved the buying process of the government resources, can we introduce a system as suggested above to not only improve the buying process but also improve the production efficiency and ensure faster response time?\n\nA food for thought!", "created_at": "2020-12-07 17:21:44.693659", "updated_at": "2020-12-07 17:21:44.693659", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1140, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 49.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6783, 6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72504, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 12933, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Ok, here's your [data explorer query to see users and their post counts per top-level category](https://edgeryders.eu/admin/plugins/explorer/?id=14).

One of our speakers, Nacho Rodriguez, who is the founder of Coworking and Coliving Canary Islands [penned a piece for us](https://edgeryders.eu/t/nacho-rodriguez-founder-coliving-canary-islands-nomadcity-conference/14066). He talked about how future technology such as 5G will enable these spaces to work effectively in rural areas and have a positive socio-economic impact on areas that previously didn\u2019t attract industry and jobs.\n\nSpeaking of new technology, Erin Westover works for Upflex, a company that is creating a new app that lets a user know where and when there is a coworking space available near them.\n\n\u201cInstead of having an office building for 200 people in the middle of Manhattan, why not allow for people to work in Williamsburg and work in Brooklyn and not have to take the trains right into the city center. Right?\u201d she asks [in a post on Edgeryders](https://edgeryders.eu/t/erin-westover-head-of-expansion-at-upflex-and-long-time-coworking-ambassador/14068).\n\nYou can expect more conversations like this on Tuesday - our event and platform will also give people in the space a chance to network through the platform and introduce yourself to our other speakers like [Gary O\u2019Meara](https://edgeryders.eu/t/covid-presents-opportunity-to-breathe-life-back-into-rural-communities/14054), [Mayur Sontakke](https://edgeryders.eu/t/coworking-has-the-potential-to-be-a-great-equalizer/14053), [Jamie Orr](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-family-of-my-own/1405) and[ Faye Alund](https://edgeryders.eu/t/burst-small-world-complacency-with-coworking/14058).\n\nIf you want to join the summit just [sign up here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/111403930154) and introduce yourself in the [event forum](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/coworking-recovery/364) or comment with your thoughts on one of the speaker\u2019s articles.\n\nHave a good weekend,\n\nEdgeryders", "created_at": "2020-07-17 14:41:46.863427", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 06:41:34.271115", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 589, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 22.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63825, "user_id": 5628, "topic_id": 11497, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Dear all,\n\nSo, the Hackathon on affordable housing has happened last weekend (Nov, 8th\u201310th).

But in the end altogether 19 people participated, including the organizers.\n\nAfter a very nice panel discussion on Friday, the participants established 4 projects that they wanted to work on.\n\nOne was on revitalizing an abandoned sanitarium near Brno, that they intend to turn into a community/innovation/creative center.\nHere is a link to their FB page for those who are interested on checking their progress:\n[Linduska 408](https://www.facebook.com/Lindu%C5%A1ka-408-110741400374297/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&eid=ARDU9Z3sLRD06YuHTAGgrspFcUWN46-dgUwdBbf7Rh_rMSbLdkhEM9EbFHe44aAk-n2RpWy_05gBBqFU)\n\nThe second group engaged themselves in developing a strategy of a political campaign that would show drawbacks of the current city policy on housing. Also, this campaign should show potential improvements to that flawed system.\n\nAnother group suggested a city-assisted platform/agency that would remove some obstacles that young and underprivileged people face when searching for housing.\n\nLast but not least! A disruptive intervention into the public space was designed.

If European/national funding can be used to some extent to start something, and we should not depend fully on it, what should it be used to?\n[/quote]\n\nFor me the most logical step is to work with LAGs. They cover a big majority of the EU territory. They already have local networks and spaces for educational purpose.\nI realised there is a good will to exchange practices internationally when I was involved in organising a conference for all LAG coordinators in Croatia. As I reached out to my contacts in France, Slovenia, Belgium and Finland. The responses were mostly positive.\n\nThe thing is, they are mostly very involved in local matters so the missing link is somebody/organisation who can transfer the knowledge/innovation from elsewhere.\n\nENRD could fulfill that purpose, as they do send information to the ministries of every country, which are supposed to translate it in the native language and spread it locally.\nI haven't been very active in rural development for 4 years or so. I can't tell now what is the capacity of ENRD, if they expanded beyond their help desk team etc.\n\nI already did workshops for LAGs, specifically about EU monitoring and evaluation systems and about new vision for the rural areas. I was also asked to give courses on Excel and bookkeeping so I know they are open to this format of spreading knowledge and giving useful info to the local population.\n\nGoing through ENRD could be a very slow process or very fast process, as they have clear guidelines decided by the policy makers...so everything would depend of them I guess.\n\nIf we or any other organisation would decide to do it, I would actually use Edgeryders platform or create a new \"section\" of it. It could just be a clone adapted specifically to the needs of farmers/organisations innovating, having ideas or practices worth spreading.\nIt could be a starting step, a catalyst and facilitator of international cooperation. Hypothetically talking, if we would have a fund available which we could dedicate for spreading these innovative ideas, we could work in 3 steps:\n1. Identify with stakeholders sharing ideas on our platform which ideas would work best in which regions (it depends so much of topography and market conditions)\n2. Spread this knowledge in cooperation with LAGs via local workshops\nOR\nwork with ministry and organise directly a conference for all LAG coordinators to spread the relevant best practices within their regions\n\n3. Finance projects in cooperation with LAGS (LAGS have local development strategies and they can draft calls for proposals)\nEligible projects would of course be specifically those in line with local development strategy AND must be pilot projects designed specifically to be **success stories** for the **innovative practices we want to spread**\n\nWell all that **after actually having a decent amount of stakeholders involved here** :slight_smile:. My opinion is that innovators and people trying out new things are very passionate about what they do and will gladly share that knowledge...especially if their activities are motivated by social and environmental responsibility, betterment of human conditions etc. \n\nI haven't gone in detail through existing calls for proposals on EU level, so there might be something already available for this purpose.", "created_at": "2020-10-27 12:45:13.405745", "updated_at": "2020-10-27 12:45:13.405745", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 588, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 88.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [85823], "is_reply_to": [85823], "is_liked_by": [8, 3, 5, 6796, 1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44602, "user_id": 4349, "topic_id": 8581, "post_number": 5, "raw": "So it won't be a problem if I remove the cover of my box and let it stand in my bedroom for example ? :p ?", "created_at": "2018-05-09 09:41:34.175693", "updated_at": "2018-05-09 09:41:34.175693", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [44585], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81398, "user_id": 6484, "topic_id": 13988, "post_number": 96, "raw": "Right?

We exist to increase physical and mental wellness through technology. We want to see the end of technophobia and victim-mentality that aliments a fear-based view of the future and prevents many from feeling in control of their own lives.\n\nI have lovely and talented colleagues who are both skilled developers and amazing artists. We started about a year ago and there are circa 60 people on our Slack channel. We hold weekly meetings in Malm\u00f6 and would love to see more groups forming across Europe.

It is one of the disadvantaged regions and it has one of the highest unemployment rates in Tunisia, especially among the women. \n\nIn this tiny town and such a difficult context, @Yosser Belguith, a young graduates from Tunis Business School, rose up to the challenge of changing this reality by opening the first coworking and community space. Through her project **Ourghema** Space Yosser has the ambition to promote entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship among the young talented and graduates in her town by engaging them in different initiatives and activities.\n\nThe space was opened last Saturday, with more than 150 people who participated in the inauguration ceremony including government officials, representatives of the civil society, professionals and many young people who were thrilled by the birth of this space.\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/219e84efcd8da7c51acdc665b68cc38296ab11b9.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"444\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5578eb4c915c2404216de92207659a747793acc2.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"461\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5efbd812defd57e3448514458c6498ff61b6cdbe.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"444\">\n\n\n\nThe feedback was quite positive and encouraging. Many young people have volunteered to help with organization of the ceremony, including talented photographers who were there to cover the event.\n\nThe space is quite cozy and dynamic thanks to the positive vibes of Yosser and her team. It is a perfect place to work for professionals and young freelancers but also to study and do homework for students.

Not clear at all what the doughnut thing adds. So you have \n\n* 1970s: Limits to growth. \"Grow, but within (physical) limits\"\n* 1980s: Sustainable development. \"Develop, but in a way that does not exceed the (physical, biological) carrying capacity of the environment).\"\n* 2010s: Doughnut. \"Satisfy needs, but don't overshoot the (physical, biological) limits of the environment.\" \n\nI don't see the innovation at all. \n\nIt is not just a matter of not being creative. The innovation here is possible and needed \u2013 and in fact it has in part been done, elsewhere. I think we need innovative answers to two questions underpinning all three versions of Limits to Growth thinking:\n\n1. How do we define human needs? Neoclassical theory has a purely subjectivist approach: your needs are what you perceive as such. As a development economist, when I visited Cuba in the 1990s I was stricken by the fact that some of the needs listed by Raworth were addressed far better than in comparable countries (Dominican Republic, or Haiti): food, shelter, education, health care, employment. But people still tried to get around regulations: specifically, though holding foreign hard currency was forbidden to private individuals (justification: \"the state needs it to cover strategic imports, such as raw materials for our industries\"). Young men would approach you on the streets, trying to hustle dollars. What did they need that they could not obtain in the local currency? Simple: branded sneakers, design sunglasses, watches. Teenage status symbols. This is a fully legitimate need in neoclassical value theory. So are weekends in Ibiza, mindfulness coaches, Ayahuasca ceremonies and avocado sandwiches. What do doughnut economists think? Do we let people define their own needs, or do we have some objective method to tell needs from mere wants? Which one? \n2. Who is to meet human needs with products and services? In capitalism, by default, this would be a for-profit company. Trouble there is: in capitalism, the real action is not in meeting needs, but in *creating* them. The entire marketing/advertising profession is dedicated to this. This is how the kids I met in Cuba had gotten it into their heads that their lives would be much better in Nike sneakers. Again: no clash with neoclassical economics here. But if you do not want to overshoot the doughnut, it sounds like a bad idea to have an entire economic system running around creating more needs. Any thoughts?\n\nThe original Limits to Growth crowd was associated with radical thinking there. Some of those guys gave the impression to be OK with supercomputer-powered, democratically accountable central economic planning, as capitalism was clearly dependent on growth and incapable of limiting it. Industry screamed bloody murder at the original Club of Rome report. The sustainable development folks were a different story: they had heavy corporate support, and favored a system of pricing environmental externalities, creating markets or quasi-markets for them. This way, we could all go on with business as usual, but you know, *sustainable*. \n\nAnd the doughnut proponents? Not clear. They are clearly embedded in the sustainable development framework, but in the 21st century that is almost the only game in town. In Raworth's 2020 [report](https://oi-files-d8-prod.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/file_attachments/dp-a-safe-and-just-space-for-humanity-130212-en_0_4.pdf) there are some hints. For example, it is proposed that world income poverty could be ended by a transfer of 96 billion USD to the poorest 1.4 billion  people (\"0.2% of global GDP in 2005\", based on [this report](https://web.archive.org/web/20120118094843/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2011/01_global_poverty_chandy/01_global_poverty_chandy.pdf)). As a transfer pure and simple, that would be about 6 dollars per person a year. By Western measures, those guys would still be very, very poor: the goal is of that transfer is to guarantee everyone at least 1.25 USD a day. Based on the report, I do not see the degree of radicality needed to make progress.\n\nBut without radicality, we will tweak a few things, but mostly wait. Vested interests *love* waiting and collecting more evidence, because, while we wait, profits roll in (and the world burns).  Alex Steffen calls it \"predatory delay\". And politicians tend to go along: they fear decisive actions, because it normally produces long-term benefits, but has short-term costs, and re-election needs to happen in the short term. The risk of wasting time is very real.

But that is not \"steady state\", because if the population continuously decreases you run out of people. This applies to a declining \"active\" population as well.\n\nAre you seriously proposing the zombie apocalypse as a desirable economy? The real-world example that comes to mind is the nuclear blow-up at Chernobyl; it killed or drove away the local population and nature is mostly thriving although with an increased cancer and mutation rate. Chernobyl is expected to be habitable again in 20 to several hundred years -- Hiroshima is already habitable. The zombie apocalypse is also temporary. In I Am Legend, Will Smith developed a vaccine, which was the beginning of the road back to civilization -- what would stop people from doing the same things all over again?\n\nIt seems to me there are reasonable issues with much of what passes as \"zero growth\".\n\nWhen you first proposed zero growth, I was supposing that you had in mind something like a \"steady-state\" economy, as proposed by Herman Daly, or the European \"degrowth\". Daly looks at the human economy as continuously drawing down natural resources, especially metals, without being able to completely renew them via recycling -- consequently we must develop an economy which extracts as little resources as possible -- a possible version of this is the idea that they economy must simply shrink.\n\nSure, economic production as currently designed draws on natural resources, which are scarce. If you consider the earth below the crust as pretty much inaccessible, that is a set of limited resources. That is a problem in the long run. But I don't see why existing products cannot be \"mined\" for metals. Daly follows Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen in invoking the principle of entropy: there is only so much energy available from the sun, once fossil fuels run out our only source will be the sun, and that is limited, thus limiting growth.\n\nBut this does not take into account nuclear sources. This also at the moment depends on mined resources. Once uranium is used up, there is thorium, which is a much larger source of energy. Once that is used, there is fusion, which uses deuterium distilled from seawater (or potentially created in a reactor) and tritium, \"bred\" in the reactor itself. The energy created by fusion is very large, and would sustain a long period of economic expansion. Finally (so far in current physics) there is matter/antimatter annihilation, which has an even greater density of energy. Although theoretically this could become a future source of energy, work in producing a practical matter/antimatter energy generator has a very long way to go.\n\nIt seems to me that ecological economists have taken a set of engineering problems associated with overuse of natural resources and turned them into unsolvable existential questions about the continuation of humans (or any other large species) on this planet. This is why I call it a \"moral\" approach -- it does not seem to me based in a rational understanding of the physics or economics.\n\nMoreover, although there is a positive relationship between economic growth and natural resource use, there is a diminishing use of natural resources per unit of value as the society becomes more advanced. The largest uptake of natural resources is no longer the US & Europe -- it is large developing countries such as China and India. Once these advance, then it will be African countries -- Latin America is of course also in there. Once this has happened, as is already beginning in China, a majority of economic growth will be in services, which use less natural resources -- a financial or educational transaction takes less resources per unit of value than a car or an iPhone.\n\nBut look at what Daly wants to do. (From the Wikipdia article on \"Steady-state economy\"): \"Daly wants to create the steady-state politically by establishing three institutions of the state as a superstructure on top of the present market economy:\n- The first institution is to correct inequality to some extent by putting minimum and maximum limits on incomes, maximum limits on wealth, and then redistribute accordingly.\n- The second institution is to stabilise the population by issuing transferable reproduction licenses to all fertile women at a level corresponding with the general replacement fertility in society.\n- The third institution is to stabilise the level of capital by issuing and selling depletion quotas that impose quantitative restrictions on the flow of resources through the economy. Quotas effectively minimise the throughput of resources necessary to maintain any given level of capital (as opposed to taxes, that merely alter the prevailing price structure).\"\n\nThat seems like a recipe for dystopia to me.\n\n1. Yes, I support redistribution in some form, but any reading of history at all demonstrates that if someone in government is responsible for confiscating and redistributing wealth, the opportunity for corruption is irresistable.\n\n2.

They invite them to an event to hear them out and get input they will use to shape how they think about/ identify what is needed to achieve a certain desirable outcomes. And then they go into a closed off process where they write  the call for tenders/proposals.

If you are invited once and then not again, you are probably not what they are looking for and that is an indication that they are not interested in your approach and you shouldnt really bother to participate in the call. So you use the events as a way to add your input/proposal/approach in the call and to gauge interest from the funders.

My instinct during this period was to delve deep in some old music. \n\nFor some reason I have become interested in two songs in particular. \"Interested\" means that I want to do my own version of them. \n\n* Nick Drake's *Way to Blue* brings us a world that contains hints, clues to some elusive mystery. Things that have always been there suddenly jump at us: what might they mean? (\"Do you understand/the light among the trees?\") It is beautiful and melancholic, like the deserted streets of Brussels these days, with the clear air and the slanted late afternoon light. I already did my version, sort of. I can do a passable solo version singing the vocal part and playing the strings quartet parts on my accordion. \n* Arcadia's *Missing* is my lockdown anthem: the haunting almost-presence of an absent lover, you feel her gaze on you, you think you could see her for a moment in the corner of your eye, but when you turn, sure enough, she is not there (\"How can you touch me/when you're not really there?\"). I would like to do an acoustic guitar + loop station version, but that's stretching my modest guitar playing.

A special software that pools disparate group's information input into collective hashtags aggregating info according to patterns/constellations of chosen issue.

For what reasons?*\n*- What is the relative importance of processes internal to relevant social groups (e.g., creating trust and connection, finding shared goals and solutions, building coalitions), as opposed to external environmental variables (e.g., relative openness of institutional or corporate environments, availability of sympathetic interlocutors, access to financial or other sources of support, legal or other obstacles)?*\n*- What impact does the digitisation of the energy system and the proliferation of social media have on the emergence and consolidation of energy citizenship?*\n*- Under what conditions is energy citizenship conducive to reaching broader policy goals, particularly the decarbonisation of the energy system, and under what conditions does it have the opposite effect?*\n\nDeadline: 01/09\n\nThey currently do not have a particular proposal, but with the University of Vigo they could contribute with the expertise in socioeconomic analysis, best practices, state of the art ...etc., along with citizen engagement, communication and dissemination.

I wonder who isn\u2019t talking about populism these days with all that\u2019s happening both on a larger political scale, as well as the widening social inequality - I suppose you\u2019d call this \u201cfatigue\u201d, and it\u2019s quite interesting to read about the delay of this effect and yet alarming in its instrumentalization. \n\nThe project's approach of improving sensemaking tools is powerful, and the threat of replication in other parts of Europe and the world is palpable, and I\u2019d be happy if my background can be useful to contribute to this project\u2019s success!\n\nAs a POC, I\u2019ve had a lot of personal touchpoints with right-wing populism - I was a 3-month old orphan in South Korea when I was adopted by a German mother and US father. I spent most of my youth in Germany, and when I returned after college, I arrived in a country that was paying lots of attention to a 'callous intellectual\u2019 who published an inflammatory xenophobic book in 2010. Since then I\u2019ve spent lots of energy trying to bring awareness to this cultural \u201cRechtsruck\u201d, which mostly fell on deaf ears (even among many climate activists). Lately however, there seems to be more openness to this topic, and it has become more of an issue among my networks (even climate justice is now increasingly becoming part of the conversation). I would be very interested in widening my understanding of the supply-side on the four dimensions you plan to study, and the effectiveness of the responses.\n\nRelated to the issues on which participants are asked to share stories, these are areas I\u2019m interested in and I think I can contribute to a good exchange and atmosphere. I think well-being should be at the center of our (economic) systems, surely rather than growth of GDP. As a father, I\u2019ve gained new perspectives on the issues of health, care, spirituality, work, and prosperity, which I think increases my empathy when engaging with people from all walks of life.\n\n[Professionally](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hiresd/), on top of co-creating social entrepreneurship programs (see [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/oci-labs-online-p2p-incubator-for-menas-youth/10249/33)), I\u2019ve been part of building the [MakeSense community](https://medium.com/@MakeSenseorg/daniel-from-berlin-connecting-sensemakers-e8f436d50310) in Berlin since 2011, and served on the global board laying the foundation for its [community-led governance](https://medium.com/@leilahoballah/makesense-governance-a-senserocket-to-reach-the-stars-1d4b0a00d48b). In 2013, I did a TEDx talk on building community through [shared activity/creativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-RBDl1Uf20) - which I think is very much a part of what Emily Thomey was describing. I also full well know the challenging feeling of building/engaging a community.. There have been more than a few community meetings where I was the only person to show up. However, connecting people is what I do even when nobody is watching (or paying), so to me it\u2019s just part of learning by doing/failure.\n\nThe guide for community managers is a nice basis that I could contribute to develop from experiences as a community manager and facilitator, another example includes utopia.de, where I managed the online community before the current redesign (an interview that\u2019s still online [here](https://utopia.de/anpacken-fuer-eine-nachhaltigere-zukunft-interview-mit-poc21-mitgruender-dominik-wind-8159/)), or as a facilitator of numerous workshops (e.g. [here](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=434543387190838) or [here](https://www.facebook.com/diego.isabellamoneda/posts/10157091263108818)).\n\nI come with both an entrepreneurial spirit as well as a desire to be in service of impactful projects.

This phase of the work implied doing so via a plurality of channels: no longer just the online platform, which people find via web search or social media, but also targeted exchanges like interviews and physical events. \n\nOur main process for acquiring informed consent to participating in research goes through a consent funnel. This is a little piece of code that will not let users of edgeryders.eu post unless they answer correctly to some simple questions, aimed at making sure they do not harm themselves by sharing information that should be confidential. This was received well by the evaluators of our proposal, and it continues to be in place. However, these new channels for acquiring content do *not* go through the usual process of signing up for an Edgeryders account and then posting, so they do not go through the consent funnel either.\n\nThere seem to be three of them:\n\n* Physical events. In the case of [this one](/t/11699) (not a POPREBEL one), @nadia explained what the event was for at the very beginning; to protect people's privacy, participants were asked not to take pictures and to respect Chatham House rules. \n* Interviews. I imagine there are email exchanges where people are asked to be interviewed, they consent etc.\n* Forms for pre-signup posting. @hugi has sketched this process [here](/t/10293/15). \n* Others?\n\nI would like to document our process for acquiring informed consent in each of these cases. Once this is done, I will get in touch with our ethics advisors (Alberto Alemanno for POPREBEL) and request their advice. I have started [a wiki](/t/11904) to collect this information.

So maybe for implementing this, starting with just one taxonomy (the \"Activities\" one) is a good idea.\n\nThe thing that I don't know yet how to implement correctly is if and how to make filtering by taxonomy terms across projects possible. As seen from the \"Making LOTE3\" example above, groups should be able to have their own taxonomy terms. To combine this with site-wide terms, we could:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Have two taxonomies: one per-group taxonomy managed via <a href=\"https://drupal.org/project/og_vocab\">og_vocab</a> and one normal site-wide one. This introduces some redundancy though.</li>\n\n<li>Have only per-group taxonomies and no site-wide taxonomy at all. Means it's impossible to filter across projects by activity.</li>\n\n<li>Have one site-wide taxonomy with multiple levels of hierachy. Site-wide taxonomy entries are at the first level, per-group entries at lower levels for making the first-level entries more specific. Then to each group, only the taxonomy terms applicable for this group would be presented. This can be implemented with either the reference_option_limit module (<a href=\"https://drupal.org/node/1507608#comment-7269814\">how-to</a>) or the og_taxonomoy_filter module (<a href=\"https://drupal.org/node/1507608#comment-7953981\">how-to</a>). Both solutions seem to be low-maturity though, and group admins could not add their own taxonomy terms easily (hopefully in contrast to og_vocab).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nSeems like I would prefer the first solution as the cleanest implementation from a tech point of view, despite the redundancy between per-group and sitewide taxonomies. Opinions? If you want to proceed with that, I could install the og_vocab module for you so you can try if it works for your purposes.\n\nAnother issue is how to actually extend the current functionality of the og_group_browsing widget that is used as the start page for groups now (as is the default in Drupal Commons, which we use). To keep future maintenance efforts low, we should try to not replace or fork this module. Instead we can add a so-called panel above this widget's post list, showing lists of posts according to the taxonomy filtering. But that's redundant and confusing :( There's a <a href=\"https://drupal.org/node/2063085\">feature request for adding taxonomy filtering to the existing widget</a>, and this would be the clean solution for the longer-term at least.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-13 14:41:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:18.456843", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 482, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24018], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69227, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 12248, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Hi Ulrike,\n\nYes, people can read this thread as our platform is a public forum.

This is our live chat medium, which completely replaces the WhatsApp. Element is where we can have ongoing conversations that don't need to be on the platform. Limit use of Element because it does not allow for documentation of processes, deadlines, etc but good for catchups and other chat-based updates (e.g. small questions, weekly \"this is what I'm up to\" checkins). \n\n**Edgeryders Platform**. For documentation of all research conversations, updates, etc. Things we should discuss in the call:\n\n* *Code review*. Where to put comments about indvidual codes and code choices.\n\n* *Open Ethnographer Manual*. When to update the manual with new processes. \n* *Memos*. Where to put longer form memos on coding choices and other theoretical / methodological / topical observations. \n* *Reporting*. Where to construct our reports, and how frequently.\n\n* *Research Call Notes*. Where to document notes of weekly and biweekly calls. \n\n**Todoist**. So that we have clear tasks and deadlines set out, I suggest we move to use todoist (like @nadia's team) to make clear what we have to do and when we have to do it by. I suggest that in our call on Friday we come up with tasks and deadlines together for the next quarter, since these are things we largely have to structure ourselves. That way we have them clearly documented and we all know what we want to be working towards. And other teams can peek and see what we're up to. \n\n### Timeframes \n**Open question**: what is our response timeframe for confirming communication? I suggest 2 working days maximum, but am open to feedback or other ways of marking this. \n\n## Team Structure\n\n@amelia is team lead. What does that mean? What do @Leonie and @katejsim need in terms of guidance, and what kinds of self-driven work does @amelia need from them? \n- Initial thoughts from @amelia - I don't want to be setting deadlines and determining how everything should look -- in large part because I think that limits your **creative thinking and ownership of the project**, which I want us all to have. I see my role as a resource since I have more experience. I also am committed to make sure our ship as a whole stays on course. I think we should **come up with deadlines and goals together**, break them into subtasks, and then all keep each other up to date with our progress, ask open questions about how to do things, and keep each other on track to hit our deadlines. I also think that the more we **document and decide together**, the less things will feel like they are coming out of the blue from on high and the more we can **account for individual differences in work structure and communication style** (e.g. if one of us is a do tasks immediately as they come up worker and the other blocks their work time at the beginning of the month for the whole month, both should be fine as long as we know what our big picture is). Something else worth clarifying and to keep in mind is that *I get paid less than either of you to work on NGI* (you're on 14,400/year, I'm on 13,000). \n\n@amelia's needs/requests right now are as follows: \n- **Code regularly and rigorously**. This will be facilitated by our bi-weekly calls where we do the code-by-code review. \n- **Think about how we can usefully and meaningfully represent and communicate the ethnographic work.** This is wide open for your own thoughts and innovations! \n- **Stay in contact**.  We can work around a lot of problems, but please don't fall off the grid. If you have issues, communicate them. Part of having flexible working hours means a higher need to communicate when you're working or not working. This should be helped by more clearly documenting our tasks and deadlines ahead of time.\n\n* **Direct communication**. If you have a problem and/or want something to be different, communicate it as soon as possible (before it grows into a larger issue), clearly and directly. If it's something you don't feel comfortable raising with me directly, you can confidentially raise it with @johncoate who can help you navigate the situation. \n\n- **Meet the deadlines we set together**. If we agree to finish work or coding by a certain deadline, let's do that. If something gets in the way, communicate the problem as early as possible, *before* the deadline hits. \n\n@katejsim and @Leonie's needs/requests of @amelia:\n\n* **Dedicated communication channel for work and deliverables:** We've just done this by moving from Whatsapp to Todoist and Element, so this is a great start to centralizing work-communication.\n* **Discussing expected tasks/deadlines in advance** so we can plan ahead \n* **Clear instructions for deliverables:** for example, \"write 1-2 paragraphs on codes XYZ\" vs. \"write an ethnographic memo with SSNA screencaptures that pull interesting stories. It will be be compiled into a report that will be circulated in xyz ways.\" The latter gives me a clearer idea of the scope, depth, and audience. \n* Not really sure how to phrase this, but I'd really appreciate better idea of how our work feeds into broader work Edgeryder does and how this contributes to the European Commission's policy agenda. Participating at the Summit was really helpful for this purpose, because it allowed me to interact with stakeholders and get a better idea of our \"audience.\" More like this, maybe at a quarterly timeline in conjunction with our reports?, would be helpful. \n\n^ I think the bi-weekly meetings we scheduled moving forward will address most, if not all, of these because it will be an explicit space for us to discuss objectives and timeline. I add these points as conversation starters to frame our discussion tomorrow about organisational structure around what we want to do differently going forward.\n\n# Actions from the Call\n\n* Send NGI Proposal / Agreement\n* add Kate and Leonie to consortium mailing list \n* create/organise categories on platform (according to list above)\n\n--\n* look in to connecting with partners more \n* OXDEG talk \n* todoist staging process (see categories on todoist)", "created_at": "2020-10-07 11:39:50.918282", "updated_at": "2020-10-17 11:47:30.405687", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1079, "wiki": true, "reads": 14, "score": 27.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86229, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14488, "post_number": 50, "raw": " use this: `https://edgeryders.eu/t/14488` \n`", "created_at": "2020-11-03 14:42:14.349089", "updated_at": "2020-11-03 14:42:14.349089", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [86228], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76821, "user_id": 6417, "topic_id": 13554, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I had a call with my colleague, who is director of the regional energy agency and they are interested, especially in these energy citizenship topics, since they are involved in these activities in their region.

As a member of diaspora and someone who is in touch with various diasporas here I would gladly explore that subject further. Key words  are inclusion and education, that is the only way to create understanding in a society built of many different groups. With understanding comes acceptance and respect. Look at minorities in Belgium, they are all in their own closed ecosystems and then you have Belgians further divided as well. There are walls between people here unfortunately (and it's like that all over Europe). Even Merkel admitted some years ago that German multiculturalism experiment has failed (interesting to see her in all out support of immigration in EU after saying something like that in 2010).\n\nUnfortunately today's power systems seem to thrive on division and fear: it is constantly used in Balkans to nudge the people towards a certain goal, to distract people and to win elections for example. Look at England or US elections, desperately attacking Russia on all fronts,trying desperately to hide their own mess.\nI participated in overthrowing Milosevic in Serbia in 2000. Back then I was just a teenager, believing in such revolutions and believing violence is justified as a response to oppressive systems. Turns out there are many levels of violence, control and manipulation. \n\nNow I despise it in every way. I am convinced that in violent revolutions we create an environment in which violent people come to the top of the power structure, it is also very logical since that is how we have set our values (if we have democratic elections where we can determine a value of a person through its contribution to the society, intelligence and other values then we create a system in which there is no place for violent people). The short term consequences of violent changes of power systems are bad. The long term consequences, however, are much worse, they are horrifying! Violent men surround themselves with more violent men (and they choose people less competent than them so they can stay in power). They create this negative natural selection systems in which your set of \"values\" determines your chances of success. The damage done to future generations by creating this kind of system is immeasurable, as is now visible in Croatia and Serbia. People who can't deal with it leave the country, those that stay fall in line or fall in depression...\n\nIn any case, @alberto if you think I can be useful in your proposal I will gladly help.

What's more there has been plenty of energy given to keeping this an inclusive and considerate process \u2013 from the initial invitations for people to put their hands up for roles prior to and after our wins, to inviting feedback in [this post on teams](https://edgeryders.eu/t/h2020-teams-what-we-need-what-you-need-what-i-need-what-they-need/8973/) in August, to personal meetings with all relevant team members. \n\n## Lesson one: Who does the work doesn\u2019t necessarily call the shots\nThere is a key lesson in how project preparation has occurred to date.  While Edgeryders stands by the principle of _who does the work calls the shots_, there has been a handicap in organisational and team building preparations for these projects that has caused some confusion for many of us. Namely that in this instance, I am not necessarily calling the shots. While @alberto and I collaboratively brought these projects in and I am responsible for their delivery, based on the model we wrote into the proposals and the scale of their implementation, I do not have complete freedom as other project leads may. Indeed there is an interdependence of leadership roles on these projects, so let's get clear on them. \n\n## Clarification one: who is leading what on EU research projects beginning in 2019\n\n- @alberto is LSIGN which means that he is **legally responsible** for these projects. This means that I run key factors and decisions by him, and document them for the Board - example: the POPREBEL Grant Agreement in the company workspace. This extends to @alberto's vision and leadership in the Research Network, and as a researcher in these projects (see below)\n- I am written as project lead into the GAs. This means that I am the contact for the Commission, the Coordinator and our partners on these projects and I am **responsible for their delivery and our corresponding reputation**. This role includes strategic positioning and stakeholder relations for the Research Network, as well as working between the consortium and @nadia on communications. I will also be collaborating with partners on 1-2 tasks in other work packages in NGI Forward - namely **WP1: Topic Identification and WP3 Policy Lab**.\n- I will be bringing in **a project coordinator to drive project management**. Under my supervision, they will be taking care of administration and finance, travel, some reporting and other components depending on the person that comes on board. More on this shortly.\n- **Team leaders have been written into the proposals as responsible for the five key tasks in the main Edgeryders work package.** I have shared this model many times but to clarify it is made up of 1. community management + 2. engagement + 3. ethnography + 4. network data analysis + 5. tech support (+ 6. project management and reporting). These tasks were written based on the proven method from the past and the experience of those that have done it to get us here. As mentioned elsewhere on numerous occasions, **team leaders for the tasks have autonomy in how they strategise and implement their delivery**. Me and my team are here as an interface with the consortium and to support delivery. It is expected key decisions are shared with all team leaders at the **bi-weekly standups** as per the Edgeryders Events calendar, and that planning is kept open for all other teams to follow. \n- @noemi and @johncoate are leading **community management** on both projects. As I've been told, @noemi will focus on POPREBEL and @johncoate on NGI Forward, but they will share trainings and mentorship to their team of community managers. We expect new multilingual community managers on both projects. \n- @nadia is leading **outreach and engagement** on both projects. This includes 12 onboarding workshops for each project, and will involve close collaboration on communications, which is currently being lead by the project Coordinators and has certain constraints and sensitivities (as per the engagement specs being posted next). @nadia will likely be recruiting a team to support in the engagement - such as for the outreach events in target communities. We have agreed in distinguishing between engagement to bring people into the conversation - @nadia, and stakeholder relations involved in Research Network development - myself. \n- @amelia is leading **ethnography** on both projects. This includes multilingual and multimedia ethnography training and working with a team. @amelia has already been active in documenting [lessons from past projects](https://edgeryders.eu/t/lessons-from-past-and-reflections-on-future-ethnographic-practice/9121), and [her intention in how to manage her team](https://edgeryders.eu/t/some-thoughts-on-collective-ethnographic-practice/9005/), towards strong delivery.\n- @alberto is leading **network and data analysis**. @hugi has been engaged by @alberto to fix bugs in the Graphryder interface. Otherwise, at this stage I believe he won't be building a team but please feel free to clarify @alberto.\n- @matthias is leading the **technical development** of the platform for both projects and thankfully also internal procedures to support smooth planning and reporting.\n- The **impact summit** is written into separate work packages in both POPREBEL and NGI Forward, and is being delivered with partners. Normally sitting under engagement, this has been a deliverable that has evolved in these proposals. In POPREBEL it is actually lead by UCL with our creative direction. In NGI Forward it is lead by us but as the closing summit of a series in the project it will be lead in collaboration with NESTA and Rob van Kranenburg.  I had discussed @natalia_skoczylas being given the opportunity to take the lead on the impact summit for POPREBEL, and @hugi getting to lead on NGI Forward. I stand by my belief that these two team members are the best people for these roles.  That being said, the first conversation was had when @nadia was on leave, and the second after several suggestions that @nadia be approached directly to discuss collaborating on engagement, and was had with a commitment to tending to people's needs. \n- The **community journalism programme** is also sitting between community management and engagement tasks. Both team leaders see it as being more pertinent to their strategies to lead. It was written into the proposals as being lead by @johncoate however I think it important we find a way where everyone can feel comfortable with how it unfolds and feeds into their own strategies.\n- To get clear on leadership and roll out for both the impact summits and community journalism programme I propose we have a call with @nadia, @noemi @johncoate @natalia_skoczylas and @hugi. I suggest this happens once the project starts so we can keep pre-project work to an minimum. However if someone would like it to happen earlier and to lead convening this call, please go ahead. \n\nAcknowledging each of our value, acknowledging each of our visions, I suggest we focus on the strength of our collective muscle; trusting in each other's visions and our capacity to deliver them, trusting each other to know every individual's value, and trusting each other to listen when we we need to call in support. \n\n## Clarification two: new models in 2019 Horizon2020 proposals and beyond\n\nThe proposal writing of NGI Forward has set a precedent in moving beyond the aforementioned model. In it I was able to weave Edgeryders into almost all work packages to become the second biggest partner after NESTA. I did that based on the Edgeryders' communities' interests and expertise, as well as based on my own professional background and research field. \n\n**I would like to again openly invite those interested to share with me your interests, your visions and how we can weave those into new proposals.** \n\nFor example, I'm working with @hugi to gauge if a call in the NGI initiative closing in March is fitting for Particip.io to start moving into the Research Network's activities in H2020. And I intend to write myself more roles in proposals that fit with my own research to eventually move beyond supervising project management. Please speak up as to how you'd like to evolve your role and/or participation in potential research projects in the future. \n\n## collaborative leadership\n\nAs mentioned, I'll be writing more on collaborative leadership moving forward however I'd like to share some parting thoughts. One of the things that first drew me into Edgeryders was how well it sees the place of unusual suspects in system change. How well it brings different kinds of knowledge together to mobilise hardcore stuff. And yet I think we are on a new learning edge in terms of how to adapt our offering to our growing teams. As the Edgeryders Research Network begins to collaborate with more partners and bring in new team members, I'm hearing the call for us to pay more attention to **how we can foster an environment that enables everyone to thrive. Where we can see beyond the sticky stuff of collaborating without hierarchies and let the magic we're doing lead the way.** Would love to hear what you think requires tending also, and how we can weave it in as things kick off. \n\n> \u201cCollaboration is an idea that is unconsciously attached to the mechanistic world in which many parts are assembled to create function. But in living systems, collaboration is much more than each doing their part. Collaboration is the readiness to show up and do what needs to be done, in improvisation and mutual learning\u2026\" _Nora Bateson, [Liminal Leadership](https://www.kosmosjournal.org/article/liminal-leadership/)_", "created_at": "2018-11-19 16:03:56.564428", "updated_at": "2018-11-19 16:03:56.564428", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1677, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 167.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 7, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85492, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14530, "post_number": 40, "raw": "thank you for joining the conversation here. sadly it was too late to send you a link to the call. but please tell us more about your experiences with large red lights that are not accepted and I hope the summary will be interesting for you.", "created_at": "2020-10-21 14:17:17.402623", "updated_at": "2020-10-21 14:17:17.402623", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 46, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 13.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85484], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49384, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 9278, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Up for it.

DSI4EU is making a case of why there needs to be a \u201cD\u201d alongside \u201cSI\u201d by linking thousands of projects in a network.\n\nThe background for this workshop is an extraordinary **imbalance in the digital world**, huge investment in business but little support for making the most of digital technology for social needs. Creative and innovative projects on the ground using digital technologies face series of obstacles while traditional civil society is still not making much use of the digital. How can the near future allow citizens to have control of the world around them? How can the EU and the DSI community work together to achieve real impact at scale?\n\nWe are moving towards a new research [Framework Programme](https://ec.europa.eu/info/designing-next-research-and-innovation-framework-programme/what-shapes-next-framework-programme_en), a new Commission and a new long-term budget. This workshop gathered senior officials from the EU administration, foundations, think tanks, civil society and DSI practitioners precisely with the aim to explore ideas and show to the newly elected MPs and the Commission what DSI can offer to tackle some of the current world challenges. To begin with, several stories were shared:\n\n- **Rebecca Rumbul** presented [MySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/). Using [\u201cFix my Street\u201d](https://www.fixmystreet.com/) or [\u201cThey Work for You\u201d](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/) is a simple way and often a first step for people to start engaging with local authorities. She stressed the importance of sharing knowledge and re-using the existing solutions and tools to start new initiatives rather than building from the scratch. More coordination is needed and leadership to standardize codes that can be re-used.\n\n- **Elena Calistru** presented [\u201cFunky Citizens\u201d](https://funky.ong/english/) and their initiative of building a Communism Museum in Romania using digital tools with the aim to show how technology can bridge gaps between generations - focusing on the \u201csocial\u201d in DSI.\n\n- **Elisa Lindinger**, director of the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/en/) which is supporting software developers based in Germany, emphasized sharing resources and knowledge as a key factor for social enterprises. In many cases, people who are behind DSI initiatives often operate without any legal structures. Being highly mobile, well connected and independent are their strengths but public funding works often against it.\n\n- **Nat Whalley** from [\u201cOrganise\u201d](https://www.organise.org.uk/) showcased their platform which allows anyone to start a campaign and team up to get better rights and benefits at work in the UK.\n\n- **Karolis Granickas**, senior programme manager at [\u201cOpen Contracting Partnership\u201d](https://www.open-contracting.org/), is dealing with procurement \u2013 number one corruption risk. They promote open data in two key areas: open contract and data standards (technical solutions). \n\nPanel discussion gave some insight about the direction in which the policy agenda is going. **Ruby Gropas** (Team Leader at [EPSC](https://ec.europa.eu/epsc/home_en)), is currently preparing briefings and materials for next institutional cycle, making clear the impact and added value of DSI as well as pointing out what still needs to be done. **Is the EU at the level where the change can happen?** Good news is that a lot has already been done. Policy makers are now aware about the DSI which was not the case a few years ago. In principle all big societal challenges that are now in focus at the EU level are areas in which social innovation strives in: climate change, migration, democracy and freedom. What needs to be shown more are the economic and financial indicators of DSI. In many EU regions, the priority should be capacity building and fostering better understanding of the value of public-private partnerships. \n\n**Fabrizio Sestini** (Senior Expert in DSI at DG CONNECT) was rather optimistic, saying that the EU Commission will continue to invest more in technologies which connect people. In future, we should share information and solutions, use technology to understand problems rather than perceive it as something which divides us and serves only economic interests. The centralization of data is the biggest issue. A few groups are doing research on decentralized platforms, such as [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu/), but we should do more. Understanding the importance of these challenges is relevant, but to put in place effective solutions we need to start with capacity building at different levels. \n\n**Susana Nascimento** (Policy Analyst and Researcher at the [Joint Research Centre](https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/joint-research-centre_en)) is co-creating and testing new solutions for policy making. Number of activities focus on how to build technologies centered on people, who builds them and how, such as [\u201cMaking sense\u201d](http://making-sense.eu/publication_categories/toolkit/) \u2013 citizen sensing toolkit. \n\nPolicy Officer at the DG GROW, **Karel Vanderpoorten**\u2019s view is that we should start locally but produce globally \u2013 initiatives to solve problems start from the community itself and our duty is to share this locally grown knowledge. Each year Commission launches [Social Innovation Competition](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/innovation/policy/social/competition_en), which might be worth looking at. This year\u2019s theme was facing challenge of reducing plastic waste.\n\nDuring discussions and practical session in groups, several things were pointed out:\n- Insisting on multidisciplinarity and investing in experiments, following the [Manifesto for DSI](https://www.dsimanifesto.eu/about/)\n- Targeted information and resources need to reach the right people.\n- More diversified, more accessible and inclusive funding options are needed. More openness means the civil society should be considered as a research community so that the maker movement and citizen science projects for example, all become part of the EU story.\n- Ensure sustainability of funded projects through new support mechanisms.\n- Coordination is the key, we need strategic lines to make a case for DSI, keeping in mind that showing numbers and impact indicators is quite essential for policy makers.\n- Fostering public-private partnerships.\n- Developing a road map for public institutions \u2013 how to use funding and legislative powers to support DSI.\n\n**Olivier Bringer**, the Head of Unit at the EU Commission in charge of the [Next Generation Internet initiative](https://www.ngi.eu/) and internet governance policy, made some closing remarks:\n- To generate new ideas we need a mix of policy makers and practitioners. The social priority and empowering citizens will remain in the focus of the Commission. DSI will have more attention, but to continue showcasing concrete examples, stories and solutions is still necessary.\n- Importance of cities: a rich environment in which testing and implementing solutions should be made possible.\n- Involving users: they are the ones who innovate. The advantage of DSI is that we can build skills at the same time as solutions.\n- Build the internet of humans supported by the policy.\n- Continue the conversation and build an alliance by structuring this diverse community.\n\nBased on this workshop, some conclusions will be made and policy recommendations prepared. I will share this when we receive updates. In the meantime, some of you might find useful these **open calls**:\n- for [co-creating a European ecosystem of DLTs for social and public good](https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/eupolicylab/cfp-dlt4good/) (deadline: 28th of May, total budget available: 700 000 EUR; duration of the action: 15 months).\n- [European Data Incubator](https://edincubator.eu/about-edi/) (deadline: 19th of June, 8-month incubation programme for big data SMEs and startups).\n\nIn terms of research, in March 2019, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement for the next budget period from 2021 to 2027 which the European Parliament [endorsed](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-19-2163_en.htm) on 17th of April. The new Horizon Europe programme will be based on three complementary and interconnected pillars:\n- **Excellent science** will support excellent basic science, strengthen the Union\u2019s scientific leadership and develop high-quality knowledge and skills.\n- **Global challenges and European industrial competitiveness** will support research which addresses societal challenges and industrial technologies in areas such as health, security, digital and key enabling technologies, climate, energy, mobility, food and natural resources.\n- **Innovative Europe** will focus on scaling up breakthrough and disruptive innovation by establishing the European Innovation Council to offer a one-stop-shop for high-potential innovators.\n\nThe future looks bright ([Horizon Europe factsheet](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/budget-may2018-research-innovation_en.pdf)).

I am overwhelmed happy to find this topic from people from our suffering but rich of change-capacities region. I lived in **Germany** 17 years for study and work, and came back 10 years ago to my hometown as a reflection of feeling responsible for cocreatinge change in how we art up life. After my return I've landed in our family business and thought good ideas like OpenSource-EcoVillage will resonate with existing organizations and people but it wasn't the case.  Now, after almost two decades of being an open visionary geek connecting the dots and thinking about how to construct a new **collective decentralized self-organizing gateway** to life so that we can encounter a system in crises can't heal it self, Ive asked my self, how to **downscale** all my concepts, ideas and passion regarding Ecovillages, Global-Palestine beyond boarders and Global Brain Application (you can refer to my [Human Lab site](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LgBQX42jIOFkfnbHf1swP3GwDd0O-jzpjYYv63OjDRg/edit#heading=h.ofqm4bivlrj4) and my [arabic blog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LgBQX42jIOFkfnbHf1swP3GwDd0O-jzpjYYv63OjDRg/edit#heading=h.ofqm4bivlrj4) ) into a **Business Model**?  This question lead me to the first steps to establish a **vision-based Open Enterprise OE** startup called **ALBAYDER** in Palestinian territories with the following **vision**: Build regenerative human-earth transformative ecology beyond borders through better form of work and business! ALBAYDER should offer 2 main services; **self-organizing P2P** good-businesses-incubator and **crowdfunding platform** to finance these businesses and other local projects at firsthand, where the successful incubated projects will have the chance to be part of ALBAYDER OE. The self-organizing characteristic  is applied from the methodology I put together to enable [open integral collaboration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16aqiWAZKI5z2k1a3lcfCVzYDyn4854KWKRZLujBCnk4/edit), which can further developed for deep learning machine to allow peers to progress with minor mentors (MentM, Mentoring-Machine) involvements.  Using internet based solutions for connecting people through reality changing business ideas into an Open Enterprise will build a nation beyond boarders, a **Global Palestine**, a possible leading model for other Arabic countries and new humanity!  @zmorda and @Sohayeb and all, as your program further developed than me, It would be great to collaborate to further develop the P2P incubator and find common supporter. If you agree, lets meet online to know each other better and see what best to be done together at the moment for the approach. For now I dont have official cofounder and just joined the Founder Institute startup accelerator branch in Ramallah. \nBeside that I've started to actively talking to people individually from my town about my project.

After reading around a lot of the World Bank issues it seemed to me a good MVP-style approach that could disintermediate and also flank their ongoing projects.\n\nOne point that set it apart from PU is that this one is more geared towards information flow BACK to the party doing an intervention. The idea is that staff will get a handful of mp3 players (and colored pearls for stringing up) with say 2-3 different sets of \"directions\" to traverse the OFFLINE social networks to carry on them at all times. When they come across an \"interesting person\" (e.g. very altruistic behavior, subject to certain condition, etc.) they can, without a word, hand them the mp3 player and things can expand from there. With the right incentives (perhaps including m-pesa) there is potential for large amounts of very detailed quant (coded with the colored pearls) + qual that should be relatively undistorted.\n\nBy default one could have most of the players in circulation doing more of a PU for poor young women with the appropriate content and a good amount of infotainment mixed in. And of course 1-2 tracks for repairing/charging etc. the players, 2-3 tracks for getting the feedback from the women, and perhaps another couple (later in the process) for building the capability to translate/record additional lectures into the local language.\n\nI currently have envisioned about 100 mp3 players (shared among 2-3 people each) with appropriate support to keep them going for a couple of months minimum in the field which runs slightly above 1000 USD. Of course it'll be critical to work on ways to reduce the technical attrition rate and balance/channel \"misuse\" into something arguably helpful.\n\nThen it would be interesting to see how results vary between a \"helicopter distribution\" vs \"digging into a niche\". And of course on the horizon is the ability to plug these collected monologues or discussion into a platform like ER. That way you're not only getting the \"word on the street\" but also the \"word at the water hole\" with some lag in very rural places.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-24 08:18:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:30.974434", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 423, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26964], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64144, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11510, "post_number": 8, "raw": "@mrchrisadams and @BlackForestBoi,  how do you feel about adding some more social mingling time to your events?

Does not affect the main thrust of the argument, it's more about @matthias and I educating each other, as we have been doing for six years now*\n\nGreenfield is an urban planner. I think his focus is on what makes a city a city. The criterion of circularity is great, but it can be applied to a single company, or household, or even a single activity, a single machine. Scholars or cities are looking in a different direction: they want metrics that you can apply to the _interactions_ that happen in a city.

On one hand, since it was designed for the enterprise it wasn't hardened against abuse, so 'Zoom-bombing' (eg crashing random open group calls and putting obscene things onto everyone's screen) is now a thing. On the other hand, it's now getting a lot more privacy and security scrutiny, and some... issues have come up. These are two sides of the same coin: you have to ask 'what would malicious people do with our software?' and the answer might be both human engineering and software engineering. A lot of the flaws people found look like simple product decisions to make installing and using easier - for example, it used the Facebook SDK so you could log-in with Facebook, but that sends some device data to Facebook. But it also claimed it was end-to-end encrypted and isn't, and some of the traffic goes through Chinese servers, and so one has to assume that the Chinese state could listen in to anything if it wanted to. To its credit, Zoom has responded pretty well to most of these concerns, and some of this can be over-played (it seems pretty silly for a school system to ban it in case the Chinese intelligence agencies are listening to drama class), but I'm not sure the UK cabinet should carry on using this. \n> \n> Stepping back, it's striking that Zoom has made such a big impact despite every tech giant having a big mature product in this space (or even several - how many of these apps does Google have? That would be a good interview question). It's really not as hard to displace these companies as some would think, if you can find the right wedge. This also reminds me of the founding legend of Dropbox: everyone told Drew Houston 'there are dozens of these' and he said 'yes, but do you use any of them?'", "created_at": "2020-04-06

Les autres m\u00e9canismes intellectuels pourront ensuite intervenir lorsque cette connexion sera \u00e9tablie.\n\nVoici quelques attributs, qui pourraient faire partie d\u2019un mod\u00e8le d\u2019Homme Lumineux, bas\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9veil Kundalini.\n\nAch\u00e8vement\n\nPaix mondiale\n\nUnit\u00e9\n\nResponsabilit\u00e9\n\nBonheur individuel\n\nHarmonie\n\nPartage\n\nPrincipe f\u00e9minin\n\nProsp\u00e9rit\u00e9\n\nDivination\n\nParole\n\nSant\u00e9\n\nAlimentation\n\nVie prolong\u00e9e\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Ach\u00e8vement</strong>\n\nPasser du stade actuel, o\u00f9 l\u2019Homme se consid\u00e8re comme un \u00eatre mat\u00e9riel, \u00e0 la conscience qu\u2019il est un \u00eatre reli\u00e9 au tout: voil\u00e0 le secret de l\u2019ach\u00e8vement de l\u2019humanit\u00e9. Un changement structurel doit s\u2019op\u00e9rer dans la conscience. Toutes les mutations physiques et mentales en d\u00e9pendent.\n\n<strong>Ma\u00eetrise de soi</strong>\n\nLa ma\u00eetrise de soi et l\u2019expression libre, et non la soumission au contr\u00f4le de forces ext\u00e9rieures ou de connaissances partielles, deviendront des principes fondamentaux qui mod\u00e8leront l\u2019existence de l\u2019Homme Lumineux.\n\n<strong>Paix mondiale</strong>\n\nSi tous les grands financiers soutenaient un mouvement pour l\u2019unit\u00e9, cela aurait une influence d\u00e9terminante pour la paix. Il n\u2019y aurait plus de capitaux disponibles pour alimenter la guerre.\n\nAinsi, la coop\u00e9ration entre toutes les nations du monde aurait lieu. Nous n\u2019aurions plus de crises \u00e9conomiques.\n\nSuivant cette tendance \u00e0 proscrire la guerre, l\u2019Homme Lumineux ouvrira les yeux sur les causes de la guerre, essentiellement provoqu\u00e9es par des nations ou des groupes pr\u00e9occup\u00e9s par leur unique int\u00e9r\u00eat.\n\nLa pratique de la non-coop\u00e9ration sera prohib\u00e9e, car elle contribue \u00e0 la guerre.\n\nChacun devra bannir son \u00e9go\u00efsme, qui nuit \u00e0 autrui.\n\nL\u2019Homme Lumineux d\u00e9couvrira que la meilleure fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9fendre son propre int\u00e9r\u00eat est de promouvoir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat commun. Assurer son propre bien-\u00eatre commence par pr\u00e9server le bien commun de tous.\n\nNous assisterons \u00e0 un d\u00e9sarmement nucl\u00e9aire complet, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019individu comprendra le sens de la paix tant au niveau personnel qu\u2019au niveau de chaque nation.\n\nLa r\u00e9organisation sociale d\u00e9pendra de l\u2019approfondissement de la perception de l\u2019Homme Lumineux, qui apprendra \u00e0 agir correctement et au bon moment. Ceci deviendra la base du fonctionnement de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\n<strong>Unit\u00e9</strong>\n\nLorsque le mouvement int\u00e9rieur des forces constructives se g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisera, les partis politiques fusionneront probablement en un parti unique pour simplifier la t\u00e2che des gouvernements.\n\nCes changements aboutiront \u00e0 un seul organe l\u00e9gislatif. La majeure partie des maux politiques se dissipera.\n\n<strong>Responsabilit\u00e9</strong>\n\nNous laissons des tiers penser et d\u00e9cider \u00e0 notre place. Nous avons eu tendance \u00e0 nous reposer sur ces tiers pour qu\u2019ils \u00e9tudient la solution, la mod\u00e8le pour nous, et nous nous sommes ensuite appuy\u00e9s sur leur r\u00e9sultat obtenu.\n\nN\u00e9gliger le d\u00e9veloppement du moi en d\u00e9pendant d\u2019une chose ext\u00e9rieure \u00e0 nous a eu pour effet d\u2019affaiblir notre propre nature.\n\nLe sens des responsabilit\u00e9s sera promu dans toutes les sph\u00e8res.\n\n<strong>Bonheur individuel</strong>\n\nLorsque l\u2019Homme Lumineux s\u2019identifiera avec la loi universelle, il pourra atteindre le bonheur individuel, car celui-ci demeure ins\u00e9parable du bonheur commun. Un individu dans un \u00e9tat physique de conscience ressent une permanente b\u00e9atitude. Lorsque dans le flux de la vie, nous n\u2019avions qu\u2019une conscience radieuse de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\n\nC\u2019est pourquoi les changements doivent d\u2019abord s\u2019op\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de l\u2019Homme Lumineux.\n\nCar avant d\u2019agir pour la paix universelle, un individu doit trouver la paix en lui-m\u00eame, r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un long et profond travail avec les forces invisibles.\n\n<strong>Harmonie</strong>\n\nLes \u00e9manations silencieuses de l\u2019essence int\u00e9rieure se manifestent par une expression ext\u00e9rieure lorsque le milieu qui s\u2019harmonise avec celles-ci est trouv\u00e9.\n\nLes progr\u00e8s de la force constructrice ne seront visibles que lorsque l\u2019humanit\u00e9 aura compl\u00e8tement min\u00e9 les structures de l\u2019\u00e9go\u00efsme.\n\n<strong>Capacit\u00e9 universelle</strong>\n\nSi une personne peut atteindre l\u2019\u00e9tat physique de conscience, tous en sont capables.\n\nUne fois que ce fait est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9, il suffira d\u2019\u00eatre accept\u00e9.\n\nEn acceptant cette v\u00e9rit\u00e9, l\u2019attitude de l\u2019Homme Lumineux \u00e9l\u00e8vera la conscience de tous, leur communiquera l\u2019\u00e9nergie n\u00e9cessaire pour am\u00e9liorer leur perception de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\n\nPar cons\u00e9quent, si un groupe de x personnes acc\u00e8de \u00e0 cet \u00e9tat, il a le potentiel d\u2019influencer des milliers d\u2019hommes. Des milliers d\u2019individus parviendront \u00e0 une conscience sup\u00e9rieure gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019action d\u2019un plus petit nombre.\n\nL\u2019Homme Lumineux prendra alors conscience de la totalit\u00e9. La conscience compl\u00e8te. Il n\u2019y aura aucune s\u00e9paration et ils n\u2019en fabriqueront pas, en restant dans l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019harmonie consciente totale.\n\n<strong>Partage</strong>\n\nTout ce qui sera sur terre appartiendra \u00e0 l\u2019Homme Lumineux, et il sera libre d\u2019en disposer.\n\n<strong>Principe f\u00e9minin</strong>\n\nJusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, le \u00abJe\u00bb a incarn\u00e9 le principe masculin.\n\nLe \u00abJe suis\u00bb est le principe f\u00e9minin. Il fait appara\u00eetre tout ce qui inclut ou con\u00e7oit, il a le pouvoir d\u2019inclusion.\n\n<strong>Prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9</strong>\n\nLorsque l\u2019Homme Lumineux d\u00e9couvrira son propre fonctionnement naturel et travaillera consciemment avec lui-m\u00eame, il progressera consciemment dans tous les domaines.\n\n<strong>Divination</strong>\n\nPlusieurs individus dans un \u00e9tat physique de conscience d\u00e9velopperont des dons extraordinaires. Certains acquerront la facult\u00e9 de pr\u00e9voir un \u00e9v\u00e9nement futur. S\u2019il s\u2019agit de quelque chose de n\u00e9gatif ou pouvant nuire \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du bien commun, d\u2019autres groupes veilleront \u00e0 ce que cela ne se produise pas.\n\nCette m\u00e9thode sera utilis\u00e9e pour pr\u00e9venir les accidents. Nombreux seront ceux qui n\u2019en auront jamais. Cela r\u00e9duira notamment les co\u00fbts en soins de sant\u00e9 et en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du travail.\n\n<strong>Parole</strong>\n\nL\u2019Homme Lumineux s\u2019exprimera en harmonie avec les id\u00e9aux les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s et les plus constructifs. C\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019ils d\u00e9velopperont leur pouvoir d\u2019agir (<em>empowerment</em>) maximal. Car plus la pens\u00e9e et la prise de conscience sont align\u00e9es avec les forces naturelles, plus consid\u00e9rable devient le pouvoir impliqu\u00e9 dans ce processus.\n\nLes paroles deviendront esprit.\n\n<strong>Sant\u00e9</strong>\n\nLorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y aura plus de fractionnement, le corps deviendra parfaitement sain et complet.\n\nL\u2019affirmation du \u00abJe suis\u00bb, accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une prise de conscience de ce qu\u2019elle implique v\u00e9ritablement, gu\u00e9rira aussit\u00f4t tout \u00e9tat de maladie.\n\nIl sera alors compris qu\u2019il est inutile d\u2019effectuer un travail sp\u00e9cifique sur des parties du corps biologique, ou de se concentrer pour traiter une maladie. Le physique gu\u00e9rira automatiquement d\u00e8s que l\u2019Homme Lumineux se rendra compte de l\u2019unit\u00e9 fondamentale de toute chose.\n\nQuand l\u2019Homme Lumineux atteindra cet \u00e9tat de conscience, toutes ses fonctions corporelles seront stimul\u00e9es jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles deviennent harmonieuses. Chaque atome de son corps sera vivifi\u00e9 et pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 agir en parfaite coordination avec l\u2019esprit.\n\nLes co\u00fbts en soins de sant\u00e9 seront alors dramatiquement r\u00e9duits, pratiquement \u00e9limin\u00e9s, sauf pour le suivi des femmes enceintes et le d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019enfant, et quelques autres interventions d\u2019accompagnement. Ces enveloppes budg\u00e9taires consid\u00e9rables pourront \u00eatre investies \u00e0 d\u2019autres activit\u00e9s, comme par exemple des cliniques de Kundalini, et des centres de d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019individu.\n\n<strong>Alimentation</strong>\n\nL\u2019Homme Lumineux pourrait ne plus avoir besoin de consommer autant de nourriture. Il d\u00e9veloppera la capacit\u00e9 de se nourrir de <em>prana</em>. Il absorbera la substance pranique, et elle sera assimil\u00e9e pour l\u2019entretien direct et complet de son corps.\n\nAinsi, il n\u2019existera plus de crises d\u2019alimentation et il n\u2019y aura plus de mis\u00e8re caus\u00e9e par le manque de nourriture ou d\u2019eau.\n\n<strong>Vie prolong\u00e9e</strong>\n\nLa vie de l\u2019Homme Lumineux ne devrait pas conna\u00eetre de limites, y compris temporelles.\n\nSi l\u2019Homme Lumineux imagine la lumi\u00e8re qui \u00e9mane de lui, s\u2019il s\u2019engage dans cette lumi\u00e8re et la laisse consumer ce qui est faux, s\u2019il abandonne ses imperfections, ses maladies, et ses situations d\u00e9plaisantes, il vivra une vie id\u00e9ale \u00e0 ses yeux, et pourrait ne point conna\u00eetre la mort physique, telle que nous la concevons actuellement.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEt bien d'autres attributs encore, que ma conscience encore que trop partielle, n'arrive pas encore \u00e0 capter...\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-16 05:17:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:56.484506", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1596, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23990, "user_id": 3559, "topic_id": 959, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Hi, I am concerned about the how we do not seem to be able to change the way education (and education policy particularly) needs to respond to the issues of 'new skills for new jobs'.

Then, in early December, Rossella wrote to me that they had changed their mind, we were to lay low as they got the city council workers to finish the renovation. No explanation was given to me. I asked Rita to investigate, and she wrote the comment above.\u00a0\n\nMy understanding is the following:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>structure (plumbing, wall whitewashing etc.) is to be left to the city council workers.</li>\n\n<li>but furniture is\u00a0<em>not</em> to be left to Mimers.

We particularly focussed on the events in Brussels as Belgium has a very particular situation with language: you can't only promote it in English, it has to be in French and Dutch as well. But they're also tied to a place where we have a physical presence. And so there are other channels that can be used, and have to be used, to effectively market them.\n\nIn general, points to follow up on with regards to all the events:\n\n* What is what is the responsibility of the person organizing it\n* Is there a Facebook event for your for your activity? @anon82932460 will set those up based on events on edgeryders. Make sure all relevant info is there.\n* Is there an event on Meetup?\n* Are you reaching out to Facebook groups?\n* What is the process to get local news publications to write about it?\n* Are there physical locations where communication can be put up?\n* Are people reaching out to mailing lists?\n* Have you assigned people to be responsible for the documentation of the events, the footage,etc.\n* Promote the event ALSO in the language(s) of the country where the event is held\n* mass communications approach is one thing, but personalized approach is a MUST as well\n\n**Sci-fi Economics**: It's not clear who is accountable for which results. What's the current situation with the communications efforts? Where do we see risks and possible points of failure?\n\nHow to fix this through comms: need to unify where all the materials are and streamline communications.\n\n* content: people need to see that there is some background to this with interesting conversations. Sci-fi started quite some time ago with a reading group, so there's institutional memory, interesting conversations, and we need to be able to communicate it effectively.\n* Physical flyers need to be printed to spread the word. Going out and engaging people face-to-face to join (share event at places online and offline where people look for things to do)\n* Facebook groups and online event places: share event there\n* Team needs help with:\n  * writing engaging copy for outreach. Ping @inge when needed\n  * Local press\n* Comms need from team:\n  * snippets of good content from legacy Sci-Fi econ conversations: the reading lists, the discussions leading up to the design of the event.\n* Marketing strategy.\n  * need to prepare different communication materials, different adaptations on the flyer we need to talk to copywriters to do this properly.\n  * @anon82932460 will:\n    * target people living in Brussels, in three different languages to:\n      * attend the event\n      * Crowd fund\n    * Target europe/US in English to:\n      * Increase live-streaming audience\n      * Crowd fund campaign\n\n**Edgeryders Festival**\n\n* Design: We need to have a designer on retainer who can produce and adapt the visual materials, flyers, posters:\n  * We need to talk to the graphic designer who originally produced them _(>>\n_ @mariaeuler commenting: Problem is that to \"fill them in\" is a lot of work if people do not provide suitable short descriptions and images, will send the rest to the designer tomorrow and ask her to just fill it to her best knowledge from what she sees in the posts, but that is not usually a graphics designers job, to make the copy fit, which is why I already had to spend quite some time on that.)_\n* Outreach:\n  * each one of these events has to have a Facebook (@anon82932460) with registration link to festival event\n  * populate the feed of the Facebook event with registration, status updates, interesting content, etc to engage people (@anon82932460)\n  * Organizers invite &ldquo;experts&rdquo; to the platform and introduce them to @inge for an interview\n  * Organizers answer questions from people who want to come to their event about the event on FB and other platforms\n  * Organizers invite their friends and networks to the event\n  * Organizers print flyers for the event (will be reimbursed)\n  * The digital version of the flyers will be used by comms team (we need to ahve them organized all in one place)\n* Community Managers:\n  * onboard people to Edgeryders platform who sign up to events and point to the relevant events or conversations that are happening on the platform\n  * Update doc with good quotes with key content:\n    * Quotes\n    * Snippets", "created_at": "2019-10-23 07:24:17.294867", "updated_at": "2019-10-23 09:31:59.867897", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 740, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86041, "user_id": 1877, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 169, "raw": "I am afraid these discussions about *all sides*, now, can be a little irritating for me. I am aware to be a potential victim of an info war, but still, I think the amount of crimes committed in the last month by the  aggressors should get more attention, and possibly some bloody intervention. The time to break bread together is far away right now, unfortunately. Necessary, yes, but the space for dialogue is super tight, with things being as they are on the front line.\n\n---\n\n**Yes, there is trauma on all sides**, and it will linger around for a very long time. Which is one of the nasty side effect of any war: conflicts stick to people, and linger around **for generations**.\n\nThis is especially true if you have an autocratic dictator (like Aliyev for example, his [family is running the country since 1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Azerbaijan), from father to son) who actively blows on the trauma fire, poisoning generations *before* you even get to combat, which is [the one thing they are allowed to march on the streets for](https://oc-media.org/thousands-of-pro-war-protesters-rally-in-azerbaijan/) in Azerbaijan it seems... but about such restrictions of expression, [let's not take my word for it](https://freedomhouse.org/country/azerbaijan/freedom-world/2020).\n\nSo yes, **I would love to be here talking about a healing process**, but the one that was tried till now never really properly functioned, because the reality is that in the last 30 years the war was always there, always flaring up in nasty ways. Now that the world is busy *not caring* about anything but COVID, the US elections, and what not, the Azeris have decided to escalate, to avoid a regime implosion perhaps? Who knows... [Turkey's in dire straits too](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/turkish-lira-hits-another-record-low-against-dollar-amid-france-row-.html), also needed to protect its own regime? :thinking: \n\nIn any event, *what we - more likely - do actually know* on the Artsakh/Karabakh war is thanks to the one side were journalists are allowed to do their job of reporting (Press Freedom Index in Azerbaijan? [168/200](https://rsf.org/en/ranking). Foreign journalists are not allowed near the action in Azerbaijan. I wonder why...\n\nSo now, putting history and territorial claims aside for a moment, here are some of the actual things that have been happening in the last month to the army, but especially to the **civilian population**, that have been attacked (forgive me, if the list is not comprehensive, nor ordered) :\n\n- [Jihadist](https://nypost.com/2019/09/21/why-isnt-the-media-covering-turkish-president-erdogans-ties-to-isis/), and [mercenaries from Syria](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/02/syrian-recruit-describes-role-of-foreign-fighters-in-nagorno-karabakh), were hired through/by Turkey, to fight on the ground\n- [Turkey actively supporting](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/02/919467165/nagorno-karabakh-turkeys-support-for-azerbaijan-challenges-russian-leverage), ideologically but also with [military actions](https://www.insideover.com/war/turkish-footprint-in-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict-from-drones-to-boots-on-the-ground.html) (their [fighter planes spotted in Ganja airport](https://twitter.com/trbrtc/status/1313903827435892737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1313903827435892737%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhyetert.org%2F2020%2F10%2F07%2Ff-16-data-from-nyt-visual-investigation-team%2F))\n- [Summary execution](https://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/286649/Karabakh_identifies_POWs_executed_by_Azerbaijan) of Armenian civilian and POW\n- Multiple cease-fire violations within minutes of it taking effect\n- One month of practically **non-stop shelling** of villages, cities (especially the capital of [Stepanakert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_bombardment_of_Stepanakert)), and civilian infrastructure - even hospitals (almost the entire population of Artsakh/Karabakh has fled to Armenia, if it isn't fighting)\n- [Cluster bombs](commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:InShot_20201020_202248937.webm?embedplayer=yes) used over cities\n- [White phosphorous](https://twitter.com/301_AD/status/1322233198991081473) weapons used to burn up forests\n- Cultural monuments, like the White Cathedral in Shushi, [targeted by missiles](https://greekcitytimes.com/2020/10/09/azerbaijan-targets-armenian-church-and-cultural-house-in-artsakh/)\n- Stepanakert hospital's [maternity ward has been bombed](https://greekcitytimes.com/2020/10/09/azerbaijan-targets-armenian-church-and-cultural-house-in-artsakh/)\n- Drones. Kamikaze drones, Israeli made, but also Turkish, [playing a big role](https://asiatimes.com/2020/10/drones-playing-big-role-in-nagorno-karabakh-fight/)\n- ...also, is [this the beginning of new pogroms](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turks-azeris-lyon-france-armenians-vienne-video-b1422175.html) in the diaspora? It wouldn't be the first time... just Google *Sumgait pogrom*, or just Armenain Genocide.\n\nWhere is the international community's response? Pretty much absent. Some concerned statements, but no action. And there had been stuff like the above, imagine if it was just soldiers killing each other. **But you know, the oil and gas from Azerbaijan will be needed to keep us warm in Europe this winter... so...** :shushing_face: I would not be so surprised if there will be a strong backlash to UN and EU as institutions here in Armenia, having been lecturing about human rights and all that jazz, and now... nothing of any substance. Unless they will eventually wake up. There is a lot of anger and disappointment all around. Including within the actual peacemakers, like @iriedawta  that have tried their best to build bridges. But right now, **they are all burning**.\n\n> So, please, really please, show me now, because I can't see where should the space for dialogue be, right now?!\n\nSo. Much. Waste.\nShameful.\nStepanakert reminds me of Sarajevo, for the little that I can remember.\n\nIt's *so so disappointing* to see the clock turning back like this, we should have better things to do to keep ourselves occupied, and instead we are looking for the nearest bomb shelter, in freaking 2020, at the edges of Europe... and at least we are the lucky ones who are safe.

Basic Considerations\n\n**The goal.** Islem's ultimate goal is a combined co-working space and business incubator in the Gbelli region of Tunisia, which cares to create businesses with innovative date palm products. This goal is not negotiable, but the way to achieve it is.\n\n**Introducing co-working in rural areas.** The very concept of a co-working space is not known in the Gbelli region so far, and it would have to be introduced gradually to make it understood by the locals. For example, a caf\u00e9 that happens to provide good wifi and desks would become an attractive out-of-home workplace, and could later morph into a \"proper\" co-working space.\n\n**Adapting the concept of a co-working space.** At the same time, the concept of a co-working space would have to be adapted according to the local situation to be attractive and successful. Simply providing space is not a sufficient motivation for people in rural areas to pay anything for such a service. However, if the space would provide more specific (and unique) assistance for date palm related businesses, it's a different story. An in-house factory for palm tree plywood and a woodworking workshop (\"fablab style\") with tools to rent are examples for such specific assistance.\n\n**On the failure of business incubation.** We see a fundamental mismatch between the problems of becoming a successful new business in Tunisia (or the MENA region in more general) and the solutions offered by business incubators and other startup assistance organizations and programmes. Namely, they bring their own pre-made solutions (let's say an \"incubation programme\") that are not designed for the actual, prosaic, matter-of-fact problems faced by the fledgling businesses they want to assist. For example, to our knowledge none of the existing co-working spaces and business incubators in Tunisia cared to solve the issue of international payments for business purposes, faced by all small and new companies in Tunisia right now.\n\n**Being a helpful incubator.** To not repeat this failure mode of incubators, this one wants to be different: it will provide infrastructure-type solutions for the very local, detailed problems faced by the business it hosts. It will listen to the challenges faced by these businesses to make sense of them. While it will not be able to solve all of the problems of starting any kind of small business in Tunisia and for everyone who has them, but can solve the 10-15 most common, shared problems of date palm related startups. (Note that \"problem\" here only refers to problems that are too big for a small business to solve \u2013 everything else is a very specific problem for the startup itself, and solving it alone is the very purpose of the startup.)\n\n**The Business Founder's Toolkit.** The incubator would want to collaborate with other co-working spaces and incubators in Tunisia which have already gathered insights about the challenges of business founders but without finding the energy to publish these and their recommended solutions in a high-quality, re-usable form online. The result will be tools in various forms (those consisting of knowledge or software would be provided for free, physical resources would cost money and bring revenue). For example specifically for date palm related companies, these tools could include the following (very preliminary, as we have no idea what challenges they are facing exactly):\n\n* **Receiving international payments.** An international prepaid credit card that works with Tunisian ATMs and is not coupled to a bank account could be a solution. \n\n* **Import service for tools and equipment.** If a tool or substance is not available in Tunisia right now, ordering and paying it and getting it through customs is a major pain in the ass even for very small items (10 EUR \"glow in the dark\" powder or 10 EUR electronics board). A tested and tried import service could fix that, while also providing revenue for the incubator. It _may_ need a hack solution at first, in which case piggybacking the goods on the cars full of used stuffs which go by ferry from Palermo to Tunis might be a good option.\n\n* **Accounting service.** In the Edgeryders company, we struggled with accounting in the early days until we found [FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com/). A similar solution but adapted for the small business context in Tunisia would help a great deal, esp. since some founders in a rural region will have limited financial literacy, to be fixed by this type of software assistance.\n\n* **Exclusive palm tree raw materials.** Raw materials that are manufactured in-house and sold exclusively to startups in the incubator provide a source of revenue while providing the startups with a much simpler way to start \u2013 they only have to add the ideas and designs and don't have to care about the raw materials themselves. Raw materials can include palm tree [plywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plywood), palm tree [MDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-density_fibreboard) etc..\n\n* **Machine shop.** Being able to rent machines by the hour rather than having to source and buy them is an important thing that makes starting a business simpler. Would be a normal woodworking workshop, plus a CNC mill for wood, and perhaps some innovative machines (for example, an injection molding machine modified to use the \"palm fiber with resin\" paste of which MDF board is produced).\n\n* **Export and direct sales assistance.** Exporting to the European Union's \"Single Market\" is a major pain in the ass because it involves dealing with the [TARIC](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/taric_consultation.jsp?Lang=en) customs database etc.. However, all non-food palm tree products fall into similar customs categories, and exporting them to customers in Europe is much simpler with step-by-step instructions for just this case. It can even be provided as a service by the incubator, combined with warehousing and fulfillment partners in Europe to provide cost-efficient logistics. All of that will ideally be in a direct sales model \u2013 selling directly to the end consumer \u2013 as it lets the Tunisian company collect a much higher part of the final sales price, making it much simpler to become profitable. For successful direct sales, quite some digital marketing knowledge is necessary, and that would also be provided in step-by-step instructions to the incubator's startups.\n\n\n## 2. Strategy\n\nWe are discussing two potential ways of founding this incubator (and we're welcoming your contributions to help decide between them):\n\n* **Indirect: Start with one pilot business, grow an ecosystem around it.** For the strategy, see [this Dynalist task list](https://dynalist.io/d/fnuexwdip76ozEptlZqHiGRm). :point_left: :slight_smile: The pilot business' product would probably be \"tiny house furniture\", see below.\n\n* **Direct: Get funding to create this new type of incubator.** Quite some organizations with \"big  pockets\" try to support the startup ecosystem in Tunisia, and they might want to fund this \"radical new type of business incubator\" because their past approaches failed. The \"radical and new\" component can be presented in a compelling way, without overwhelming the audience with all the details that this incubator promises to care about.\n\n\n## 3. Tiny House Furniture as a Pilot Product\n\nTiny Houses have become a proper emerging market by now, with house builders and workshops etc. catering specifically to this \"movement\". It also is no longer a \"poor people's solution\" but has gentrified into a hipster phenomenon already \u2013 which means, there are people who can spend serious money on this.\n\nIn this context, there is still no company specifically providing _furniture_ for tiny houses. But as I can confirm from years of living in the 4 \u00d7 2.20 m space in my truck, ordinary furniture does not cut the mustard. You need specialized space saving furniture, and it is an area still awaiting a lot of idea input by designers.\n\nTiny house furniture also connects to furniture for campervans and other RVs (\"recreational vehicles\"), and #vanlife is already becoming a thing among young Tunisians. An online configurator that allows to order tiny house / RV furniture in desired sizes would add a lot of options and potential customers as well. The process can still be efficient as the online configurator can produce CNC data to create this furniture (for example via [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) or similar parametric CAD solutions).\n\nThis makes it a good candidate for a first product range from palm tree wood that could be sold successfully on international markets. Especially so, since tiny house advocates are usually eco-conscious minimalists, so marketing products from recovered wood resources to them should be a  simple task (palm tree plywood would be made from palm midribs, which are the \"branches\" that a palm tree discards over time as it grows, and which are currently of very little use and are often just burned). Feedback and ideas on this evaluation are of course welcome :)\n\nTo conclude, have a look at related furniture items made by others:\n\n* [Inhabitat: Small Living Solutions](https://inhabitat.com/tag/small-living/)\n* [Resource Furniture: Space Saving Furniture category](http://resourcefurniture.com/product-category/product-collections/space-saving-furniture/space-saving-essentials-space-saving-furniture/)\n* [savespacefurniture.com](https://www.savespacefurniture.com/)\n* [OpenStructures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStructures), a modular building system that could inspire something similar for \"reconfigurable furniture\"\n\n\n## 4.

So we keep Talk as a CMS of sorts, but have a little bit more control of the presentation. Mostly it's about removing clutter like the sidebar, loading screen, comments, threads list, etc.\n\nThis speaks for keeping the caching-microservice separate from Discourse, as it would allow building a frontend framework that could be used to present content from any public forum with an open API by just adding new calls to the microservice. Front end framework would always get identical data from the microservice.

And my understanding of European copyright law is that there is no fair use regardless. Do you know if this is the case?\n[/quote]\nYes, there is no fair use in European legislation. In theory, international copyright law (like UN treaties from WIPO from the mid-1990s) do not allow for fair use exemptions in copyright law - they're in the US legislation still because the US didn't sign the Berne Convention until 1986 in either case, and also the US has a strong case of exceptionalism, meaning, they sign international conventions but then do not implement in national/federal law, and it's not like anyone can seriously challenge US non-compliance with international commitments anyway.\n\nThe argument for not having fair use is that it becomes a question of litigation what is permitted and what isn't. This makes it a costly and uncertain exemption for both copyright holders and copyright users. If there is an exhaustive list of well-defined exemptions, the legal certainty is theoretically higher and the risk of litigation lower, but of course EU-level legislation (like the Infosoc directive from 2001) still introduces a fair bit of uncertainty: most of the exemptions and limitations are optional for the member states to implement, meaning there is huge divergence between different jurisdictions on which exemptions apply where. Also the exemptions and limitations can have multiple, difficult-to-assess requisites that need to be fulfilled (the private copying exemption has five requisites that need be fulfilled in order for the exemption to apply, for instance).\n\n[quote=\"johncoate, post:8, topic:12217\"]\nBanning \u201chate speech\u201d is really a minefield. And where do you stop? I don\u2019t need a censor. I can decide for myself what is and isn\u2019t acceptable.\n[/quote]\nEven knowing that all the questions in this paragraph were rhetorical I'd love to hear your thoughts on this more generic follow-up:\n\nIn the EU, it's fairly common for legislators to directly intervene in free speech, e.g. through legislation. France is for instance very keen on democratically deciding through decrees and laws what constitutes \"facts\" (so in France you can't, by law and under threat of criminal penalty, deny the Holocaust, or deny the Armenian genocide, and a bunch of other things). But also Europe in general has strict restrictions on commercial speech (advertisement) e.g. you can't promote your product by saying someone else's product is worse, and a whole list of stuff like that (I think the black list has 12-16 requirements or so). Practically speaking it means we have a lot of public debates about stuff like hate speech, facts, etc. because the legislature decides on it.\n\nIn the US, I understand it's more common with private censorship - leaving the decisions exactly to platforms like Facebook, Google, and others to determine through interactions with \"civil society actors\" (for lack of better words) what needs to be blocked and what doesn't need to be blocked. So that means that protections against immoral content that might harm the moral fostering of young people are fairly strong in the US - since the web sites are optimizing against being sued by relatively strong and litigious religious groupings. And also that there is a lot of trademark and copyright-related censorship, since the same web platforms would be optimizing against being sued by IPR holders. \n\nIf you want an entirely separate reference but in /that/ area (private vs public censorship) I am a mega-fan of James Boyle's Foucault in Cyberspace from 1997: https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/619/ \n\nIt's a short text (16 pages and most of it is footnotes) but I think it's not given the weight or relevance in contemporary discussions on how to deal with undesirable content at all.", "created_at": "2020-04-30 09:00:56.593291", "updated_at": "2020-04-30 09:00:56.593291", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 658, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 26.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [73419], "is_reply_to": [73419], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57093, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 10383, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Just got pulled out of the room I was in.. do you have a meeting id number?", "created_at": "2019-07-24 14:36:19.292718", "updated_at": "2019-07-24 14:36:19.292718", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [57091], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57286, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10391, "post_number": 9, "raw": "It was in some kind of plenary session.

One of our speakers, Nacho Rodriguez, who is the founder of Coworking and Coliving Canary Islands [penned a piece for us](https://edgeryders.eu/t/nacho-rodriguez-founder-coliving-canary-islands-nomadcity-conference/14066). He talked about how future technology such as 5G will enable these spaces to work effectively in rural areas and have a positive socio-economic impact on areas that previously didn\u2019t attract industry and jobs.\n\nSpeaking of new technology, Erin Westover works for Upflex, a company that is creating a new app that lets a user know where and when there is a coworking space available near them.\n\n\u201cInstead of having an office building for 200 people in the middle of Manhattan, why not allow for people to work in Williamsburg and work in Brooklyn and not have to take the trains right into the city center. Right?\u201d she asks [in a post on Edgeryders](https://edgeryders.eu/t/erin-westover-head-of-expansion-at-upflex-and-long-time-coworking-ambassador/14068).\n\nYou can expect more conversations like this on Tuesday - our event and platform will also give people in the space a chance to network through the platform and introduce yourself to our other speakers like [Gary O\u2019Meara](https://edgeryders.eu/t/covid-presents-opportunity-to-breathe-life-back-into-rural-communities/14054), [Mayur

I will try to answer from my point of view. What inspiring me to move here was this phenomenon, typical of small town (expecially in southern Italy), of the young population to move to big cities. So almost 2 young on 4 leave the town. Then there is another phenomenon very strong, people create different associations in order to get fund and develop projects but \u00a0they don't collaborate between them. The effect is that you can find different similar projects that together could get bigger results and impact. People here are looking for something different, nowdays we are developing also the candidature for Matera as European Cultural Capital, but they need to be inspiring. They are really welcoming to foreign people, they are used to see around \u00a0turists and now, that I moved here, they were very friendly and I feel already completely integrated in my \u00a0neighbourhood. Creatives were mapped in a platform called <a href=\"http://www.visioniurbanebasilicata.net/\">Visioni Urbane</a>\u00a0(@Alberto Cottica helped to develep this process)\u00a0and they are still implementing the system. I my opinion, \u00a0the challenge is to think of Matera as a complex territory where a project like unmonastery can really inspire others to make things real and different. To inspire that is better to learn by doing and become a change maker step by step than just complain about bad situations. I think that Matera has so many contrasts in its identity/history/culture that is a perfect EDGE situation to start the Unmonastery project!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-08-01 15:59:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:01.303114", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 274, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13783], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44130, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7983, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Hey @amin_osama, I was wondering if you had contacted @MurielAboulrouss after all.

In fact, I agree almost completely.\n\nOnly about the globalized economy we might have a different view. I did not mean to say that there will be no global commerce any more in a post-carbon civilization. However, I still think the chances for an economy that is not _dominated_ anymore by global exchange of physical goods and raw materials are pretty good. Reasons being:\n\nFirst, if we will finally get to a system that, as you say, will assign true prices incl. all externality costs of environmental (and social!) damage etc. to items that are on sale, then the price difference between mass manufactured industrial goods and more locally and less time-efficiently manufactured goods will be quite different and for some items may even reverse. In such a system, it would no longer be acceptable to exploit workers in low-wage countries half around the globe to have a comfortable living.\n\nThis becomes all the more interesting when local manufacturing will have access to new processes and machinery so that products from local materials become cheaper and new products from local materials become possible. Here is an odd and definitely speculative example: in my parents' household there are a few baskets that friends brought from Bhutan around 1995, called _bangchu_ and [looking exactly like this](https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/bhutan-hand-made-banchu-bamboo-cane-woven). These are astonishing little things: one has been in daily use as a bread basket for years, and still nothing is broken and it looks almost like new. It has seen many plastic bowls etc. come and go, and is made just from bamboo and natural dyes: no fossil fuels, no rare materials, no bioactive plastic softeners, no mining waste, no nothing. \n\nWith future machines that would prepare, slice and even weave locally grown bamboo, this might really outcompete plastic bowls and perhaps also stainless steel bowls in a future with truthful prices. That's a product that can be made with moderate capital investments and only local raw materials in a local factory. Given that, it makes way less economic sense to ship the same product from China.\n\nI recently explored the technical feasibility of such a way more localized, near-autarkic economic system, and I think it is a serious candidate for a new economic order (supposed there will be some collective soul-searching before and we get to a time where ecological sustainability and restoration will be the highest law). Anyway, my notes from that exploration are over here:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/an-autarky-system-for-cities/9141", "created_at": "2019-10-04 21:35:02.899579", "updated_at": "2019-10-04 21:35:02.899579", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 464, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 31.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [48259], "is_reply_to": [59319], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68038, "user_id": 5092, "topic_id": 12283, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![image|690x388](upload://dJW5qnRhPtg0emvOEngc98Iny4Z.jpeg) \n*Marcel presenting the IoT Design Manifesto @ Next '16 Hamburg*\n\nRecently as part of my [Edgeryders fellowship](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-can-we-put-humans-citizens-first-in-our-smart-city-policies/9878) in the Internet of Humans program, I had the opportunity to interview designer and technologist \u2014 and long time collaborator \u2014 Marcel Schouwenaar (@Marcel, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarcelSch_)). Marcel co-founded Rotterdam-based design studio [The Incredible Machine](http://www.the-incredible-machine.com/), helped kickstart [ThingsCon](https://thingscon.org/) in the Netherlands, co-authored the [IoT Design Manifesto](https://www.iotmanifesto.com/) and recently has been exploring the [cooperative movement](http://weownthisplace.nl/), especially [housing co-ops](the-equitable-project.org).\n\nBelow, the transcript of our interview, slightly edited for easier reading. Enjoy, and share your thoughts!\n\nHere goes!\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\nPeter:\nMarcel, would you maybe first just tell us a little bit about your background and then we can start from there.\n\nMarcel:  \nSo my name is Marcel Schouwenaar. I'm a designer by trade and I've been working in the field of emerging technologies for the last 10ish years. Mainly as a consultant working with companies trying to implement new ideas around IoT or blockchain, doing a lot of concept work. A couple of years ago, we got a little bit the itch about what technology is, you know \u2014 the impact of technology. Considering what is ethical was not ethical. We ran into some issues there ourselves and from then on, we commit ourselves to creating more ethical technology. \n\nI really work with our clients to implement technology around values of privacy and security.To that end, we published an IoT design manifesto and I collaborated with you and a whole bunch of other people to organize this yearly conference and a bunch of other events called ThingsCon. And I think it was about a year or a year and a half ago that we realized, when you talk about ethics and technology to some part, it's about the ethics and the the moral compass of those who develop it and those who create it. But I think the main driving factor or most influential factor in what type of technology gets developed and which one doesn't is the incentive structure around the technology. It's the business model. It's how the business is structured. It's about how you relate to investors. It's about how you how get your funding. Are you the client or the product? And that led us to investigate how we can leverage technology to empower the cooperative movement. We're now looking into if we can develop technology to help housing cooperatives get off the ground.\n\nPeter: \nThat covered a lot of ground. Maybe let's take it a little bit from the top because I think there's a lot in there. One thing you mentioned that a lot of the work you do now focuses around is the business model side of things. So there's a bit of a counter narrative to what's become the cliche of the Silicon Valley model \u2014 which is inherently a pretty hardcore neoliberal model \u2014 and how that can work within a more human centric model. That seems to be a theme in your work. And the other is responsible technology and how to build the technologies in a way that they foster  better behavior and better outcomes. \n\nWe first met when you came to the very first ThingsCon event out of what I can only imagine was a whim and a big gamble on this being worth the trip over to Berlin. And a year who  later you were the one one of the key people who brought ThingsCon to the Netherlands, where we have our strongest community anywhere in the world, very much thanks to your commitment and getting that started. \n\nWhat made you come to the first ThingsCon and to then bring it over? Because at the time, I don't think you were so explicit about that focus of your area (on responsible tech). You were doing product design and design work, but in a more classical model at that time, right?\n\nMarcel:\nYeah, back then we used to be a more traditional design studio, but in a sense that we're more focusing on Future content for our clients. So really looking at opportunities in emerging technologies, and IoT came natural to us. The field of IoT came very natural to us because we have a background in hardware. I have a background in software development as well. So it's very natural to look at the world around us and see: Can we reimagine it if we hook it up to the internet? What could it be? From what I remember at least and this being 2013 to 2014? So this was a whole new category of products. You know, we were still imagining this. There was no, say, Amazon Alexa.\n\nThis was all pretty new and it was an exciting category and it felt like hey, you know, if we tap into this technology, we can do things more efficiently, like more energy efficient. There's so much inefficiency in this world. You know, why is the garbage truck just driving around looking for which bin to pick up, you know, let the bin call for a pickup. It makes so much sense. And it was in that period that I, through [Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino](https://designswarm.com) recommended for me to go to ThingsCon and explore what's happening there, and we were really looking for a community. But back then, I have to admit, I only saw upsides. I was looking for that story. I was looking for those exciting ideas to share this inspiration and share this fire. And I think that that was \ndefinitely the energy of the first ThingsCon. \n\nPeter:  \nYes! That that space has really changed a little bit. On the one hand, on the positive side, things have professionalized a lot. But also we've seen a lot of like the darker underbelly of that particular field.\n\nMarcel: \nIt's funny how fast that went. The first year, I really came driving down to Berlin with my car filled to the brim with electronics to hack a bunch. I brought a bunch of electric amps, which were Arduino-like boards that you can easily hook up to the internet. And we did this fun workshop where we hack together like this huge Rube Goldberg machine that tweeted and that responded to things happening on the internet. I loved that energy of that first year ThingsCon. So if there was anything that I wanted to take home from that event was that energy and that inspiration and that exchange. \n\nBut then in the meanwhile, we worked as consultants. The conversation around future products kind of shifted from, you know, what are exciting experiences. I think we departed from the experience side. It was more about, what is the business side? What are the efficiencies, how can we put some numbers behind those efficiencies? What's the architecture? What's the business model? It was around that time that we're going to talk about things like vendor lock-in, data ownership, about hooking people up to an ecosystem. Those were things people were playing around with in the business domain. And at first, you know, it was fine. I mean, that's what doing business can be about and you help like the best player to win, but I think in pursuit of the competitive edge the conversation was eating into human dignity. \n\nFor instance, worker exploitation was an important theme that we saw, like a lot of companies were like: Hey, can you help us out with monitoring the workplace, with monitoring the behavior of people in the workplace. It starts off with tracking delivery vans, and then tracking deliveries, like tracking packages. Let's not lose the package. And the next things will be, can we quantify the behavior of the people handling those packages, and optimize delivery of those packages. And it was slowly creeping into this area where you would feel like \u201cDo we want this? Do we want to quantify everything, know everything and use that knowledge, to whose benefit?\" That shaped I think a lot of the discourse that was brought to the subsequent ThingsCon events. And it was hard to imagine and still is, but we need to ask\"okay, but then how do we leverage these technologies?\u201d\n\nMaybe you can say \u201cSo, are we going to be Luddites? Are we going to push this technology out? Do we say no to it, restrict it? Do we regulate? Do we limit? Or is there something else that's possible?\"\n  \nAnd that's now opening up a new debate.\n\nPeter:\nThis is essentially asking not just what can we do, but what is desirable to do. Not just what's possible, but what is desirable and responsible. There is like a lot wrapped up in this fight. I feel the very same shift. I think we were on the same journey together, where at the same time it places these things in a debate on a foundation of digital or human rights, and also on providing a level playing field between those who build technologies and those who would be living with them. I don't want to call them just the users, because those living with the technology and impacted by it are not necessarily users, they could just be other people as well.  \n\nFrom there, you then went on to publish the IoT design Manifesto which had\u2026 10 principles?\n\nMarcel: \nOf course it has 10 principles, what's a manifesto that doesn't have exactly 10 principles. *(laughs)*\n\nPeter: \nWhat I found interesting is not just that these principles have held up really well. As always with these things, people keep asking, what does it mean, how do you operationalize that, but that's not the job of a principle? These principles, I think, have held up really, really well. And I believe you actually used them in your daily work, right? You didn't just publish this as a social signal. The manifesto also helped the right clients to find you, and the wrong clients to avoid you. And you\u2019d use the manifesto in client contexts, didn\u2019t you? \n\nMarcel:  \nYeah, we used it as a conversation starter. Because how do you engage in conversation with that client that wants to attract workers or something. It's hard to be very articulate about if you if you haven't established the framing of your thinking. We were trying to establish a level playing field, in order to depart from a place of shared shared knowledge. So we had to create that shared knowledge base. You can read the manifesto at [iotmanifesto.com](https://www.iotmanifesto.com/).\n\nPeter:  \nI'll just read the headlines, not the explainers:\n\nWe don't believe the hype. \nWe design useful things. \nWe aim for the win, win win. \nWe keep everyone and everything secure. \nWe build and promote a culture of privacy. \nWe are deliberate about what data we collect. \nWe make the parties associated with an IoT product explicit. \nWe empower users to be the masters of their own domain. \nWe design things for their lifetime. \nAnd in the end, we're human beings. \n\nMarcel:\nIt held up pretty well. But if I would do it again, I would even have more particular or more explicit principles in there. It addressed all these issues. It was addressing transparency, it was addressing, are we in this for the right reasons? Are we respecting privacy? Are we investing in security?\n\nPeter:\nIt's essentially a map of all the potential areas from privacy to security to data ownership, the whole thing, right?\n\nMarcel: \nYeah. And it really helps you guide through all of these. Even within our team, it happens that we have a certain conversation and someone brings up like, \"hey, are we keeping everything and everyone secure? Are we aiming for the win win win or is this...?\" You know, it helps to set the stage for a conversation, rather than what to do. And I think that's also why it was pretty widely adopted. It isn't really \"choosing color,\" in a sense, you know, it doesn't really commit yourself to a certain stance or a certain position. But it helps you mention the things that we find important. And then allow yourself to say how important they are and how committed you can be. \n\nAnd now we're creating our own startup. We're having these trade-offs all the time, you know, we're all the time looking at the manifesto. We design things to last for a lifetime: So we're now focusing on these housing cooperatives, these will exist for 30 years, right? Or 50 years or if it works out for 100 years, they will outlast us. Hopefully we don't exist in 100 years anymore. Hopefully. I don't think we should exist, and our product potentially should not exist in 100 years anymore. Hopefully, we will move on as a species from certain technologies that we're using today. But we're creating something that has to transition or be able to grow along with these organizations. And that means we shouldn't be, for instance, writing code that kind of locks data in certain structures. Because that data is owned by the people we make it for. And they'll be using that data and they will be relying on that data long after we cease to exist. So we need to take that into account.\n\nPeter:  \nThat that was probably simpler in pre-digital times. I own an old watch that I inherited, that's like sixty years old, literally all I had to do when I first wanted to wear it was give it an oil change. I couldn't personally do that, but it wasn't hard to find someone. And there's nothing proprietary in that. That's going to be like a whole different thing if you work with digital technologies. \n\nSo that's really interesting, because so you did some design work, and you also did a bunch of speculative design that aimed to democratize design and understanding of algorithms. And now you're building a thing in, vaguely, the space of cooperatives. I'm saying \u201cvaguely\u201d because I understand it's early stage and I\u2019m not sure how much you can share yet. But can you explain a little bit of what drew you to cooperatives in the first place?\n\nMarcel: \nYeah. So the funny thing was that I already had these ideas about rethinking the structure of business.\n  \nSo, two, three years ago, we we had this crazy idea of \"can we create a bike that manages its own funds?\" Can we can we make a kind bike that rents itself out and spends its own money? It was meant as a speculative piece and then technologies came into being that might enable this idea so we poked around a little in this space, and it got us thinking: isn't the pursuit of making profit a driver for doing business as much as delivering a product or service or a value? I mean, most of the products and services that we that we know, of course they exists to provide value to people or society. But after a while, especially in this stuff, there's companies that have basic requirements to make a profit. If they deliver a tremendous a lot of value, but very little profit versus a product that does \u2014 you know, the other way around. Which one are you going to kill and which one are you going to scale up? Are you going to scale the one that provides a lot of value? Are you going to scale the one that provides a lot of profit? And that got me thinking.\n\nThe funny thing is that you are never the first one who had a particular idea. And there are people that have thought about cooperatives really well for over a century and there's a lot of interesting models in that space where actual products and services are created, from food to housing to the milk that we buy in shops and the flour to make bread. There's a lot of these organizations that exist to benefit their owner, which is the worker or the client or the customer, or at least a grander, bigger community. And it's called a cooperative. And we thought: Whoa, this is this is awesome. This is a cooperative. That's great. That's exactly that's the solution to our problem that we had that we were playing around with these ideas.\n\nPeter: \nSo we\u2019re back at business incentives.\n\nMarcel: \nExactly. You don't have to reinvent the wheel. We came across a lot of interesting other models as well. Steward-ownership is a very interesting model. B-Corp, they they have they have an interesting model. The challenges and technology that we've been facing thus far are in product creation \u2014 how do you align the value that's created with the interests of whoever benefits from it. The cooperative is exactly that. Those who benefit from the creation of the value and the revenue that it produces are one and the same. It\u2019s the same group. And that makes a lot of sense.\n\nPeter: \nSo you don't have any incentive to to extract any financial value and redistribute it outside to a third party. It all stays within the same project.\n\nMarcel:  \nYeah, it stays within the same community. I mean, there are examples of cooperatives that are extremely successful also for their owners, you know, people living really well from a corporative But it doesn't produce billionaires, which is a nice side effect.\n\nPeter: \nIt doesn't make for a shady pitch to a venture capitalist but that may be part of the point. \n\nMarcel:  \nWell, that's interesting because we're now part of this program funded through Next Generation Internet, a program called ledger. And what we see is that quite a few \u2014 I think of the 16 teams, at least four, or maybe more \u2014 are working on digital cooperatives or the tools for cooperatives.\n\nA lot of people are looking into this and we are rookies in the program because we didn't exist before the program as as our house co-op team. The other teams did, and have been working quite some time in this space. And they're all facing the same challenge. You need to fund yourself because you cannot guarantee crazy return on investment. And as a startup, or as a venture that's risk taking and innovating, that's quite challenging. You cannot be a 10x cooporative \u2014 that doesn't exist. There's no such thing as a 10x cooporative. And I think in that sense, maybe steward ownership or investments through that kind of structure makes more sense. But venture capital doesn't make sense in this space.\n\nPeter:  \nI have to ask a very obvious question \u2014 I assume you have discussed why you didn't choose a cooperative model for your own venture?\n\nMarcel: \nFor this venture now, it's on the roadmap. It only makes sense. It really makes sense once you\u2019ve found your model, once you\u2019ve found your groove. And we haven\u2019t yet, I'll be honest. There are still a lot of assumptions around our business model that we haven't verified. But we intend to be a cooperative.\n\nPeter: \nNeat. What I really find really appealing in the whole debate around cooperatives, is that it seems it's really hitting a sweet spot. At least in our circles, our niche in the tech scene and other people who are fed up with some aspects of it, cooperatives seem like a very contemporary approach. An alternative approach that is due for a bit of rejuvenation. Not least because, like you said, it aligns the business and ownership structures a little bit better with those who will be using stuff \u2014 which also seems to increase resilience because you're not as dependent on things like third parties staying in business and not pivoting away from running your home, or whatever it might be. \n\nIs there a place online yet where people can already learn how to get in touch with you if they want to help or discuss stuff with you, or any other link that that you'd like to drop? \n\nMarcel:\nWe have a very rudimentary website up on the-equitable-project.org which was kind of like our the big project of which *house-coop* is part. For now, you can find us at weownthisplace.nl. It\u2019s in Dutch though, because it's focused on the Dutch market for now. We try to kind of create a movement around the proposition of CO-owned housing, or cooperative housing. I emphasize bit more like the CO-owned aspect. That's something that we feel aligns well with our intentions. We're not necessarily about intentional community, that's not what we're aiming for. \n\nWe try to facilitate some form of ownership because we think it's good in the uncertain times that we live in now. It's good that you build up some equity, own something. Again, referring back to your moral compass or ethical decisions. We want to champion a certain model, which is the \"limited equity cooperative\", where people build a little stake in the company that owns the real estate. That means you will get a return. What you invest in over time, when you're paying rent, you're also investing in this kind of initiative that will be rewarded through a limited return on that money, but will steer away from speculation on real estate. \n\nPeter:\nTo me that this feels just really fresh. This feels very much of the now. It feels like a very contemporary and pragmatic approach while still allowing people to put roots down in the community without going all in with their private lives. It makes a lot of sense to me.\n\nMarcel:  \nThe thing is, with intentional communities and the likes of those, the members of these groups are often very motivated and very willing to invest time and effort into creating this ideal situation. You don't need a ton of technology to make this happen because they're already sharing knowledge. They're really great and successful making these ideas happen. \n\nBut what we try to do is to bring this model to a more mainstream demographic, which are first of all attracted by the idea of being able to live somewhere they can afford. I don\u2019t want to say *affordable housing* because that's has other implications, but housing they can afford, and then also living in a community. We live together with people where you still have your own household. We live together, and then you save something for a rainy day, build some equity, and then maybe last is, you're actually investing into a more ethical form of housing. You\u2019re contributing to a more ethical housing market. \n\nPeter:\nIt seems much more sustainable than the real estate speculation that we see around the world these days. That I see in Berlin every day, and I'm sure you see in Rotterdam as well.\n\nMarcel:  \nYeah, it's crazy. What we're seeing here now is that already, like almost 20% of EU households are spending over 40% of their income on housing. And that's a statistic that includes everyone. You know, if you just focus on the urban centers, the statistics go through the roof. And if you zoom in on young families, people between 20 and 40, in Amsterdam half of the families in that bracket spend half of their household income on housing. And that's often not going towards owning.\n\nThen we leverage technology towards this model that has been pioneered for like a century. We kind of wrap it and and give it like a contemporary user experience. We make it easier to navigate. We give you easier control and ownership over this organization. It connects better with how people now tend to interact with systems. We're trying to create a 21st century interface to an idea that's pretty old and established. And I think that's the key to it. \n\nPeter:\nThat sounds really fantastic. I wouldn't know where to start otherwise, setting up something like this.\n\nMarcel:  \nWe're still figuring it out, too. We\u2019re doing tons of little prototypes. We're figuring this out, starting with the Netherlands. So the international audience has has to be patient until we can export something. We're still in the sandbox.\n\nPeter:  \nThat sounds amazing. And sounds like you have your work cut out for you. This is like certainly a mission worth working on. Is there any way or anything that you are looking for help with? Were there any leads you look for in case someone stumbles over this? Any kind of support or external partnerships or anything you're looking for?\n\nMarcel:\nActually, I've been digging through the Edgeryders forums, and I've found a ton of interesting discussions around tools where community, that communities can leverage to organize themselves.There are things like Open Collective and Loomio which are like great examples, and we aspire to be something similar to them in our space. Right now I\u2019d love to have some some good chats about how these tools have worked in other fields or what people are thinking about. Learn more about other domains from which we can we can learn.\n\nSo one of the challenges that we have is that we think here\u2019s an idea that\u2019s potentially great. So I know how to transfer code, right? I know how to write a piece of code and put it on GitHub and document it and that's what I can do. In the past when we did the IoT Design Manifesto, IoT became an idea in itself, that kind of moved by itself. I came across schools that implemented the IoT Design Manifesto is kind of like a table of contents to their ethics work. \nBut how do we how do we make ideas transferable? How do we tell the story of that we can organize ourselves differently? Enough of preaching to the choir. I mean, that's what the scene many times with these debates, they tend to turn inwards at some point. But I would love to talk with makers and shakers, have experience in, you know how to get how we get the message out, you know how to get it out how to spread these ideas. That\u2019s a challenge where we're learning. I would love to pick some brains about this. \n\nI think I\u2019d like to start a forum thread about this. Maybe put together a webinar, a group discussion online or something where we sit in a room. Figure out how to transmit these ideas, how to enrich those ideas, how to how to shape those ideas. \n\nAnd if there's blockchain enthusiasts who want to share some ideas...\n\nPeter:\nExcellent. Thank you so much for your time. That was fantastic. I learned a lot, I\u2019m really looking forward to next steps and fingers crossed. Lots of lots of luck and success in this. The world needs it.\n\nMarcel:\nWe will need it.

Cities and their challenges</h3>\n\nWhile some of the world\u2019s cities are clean and green, many others face enormous challenges from national and international migration, mismanagement by past administrations, corruption, air pollution, waste management, unemployment, healthcare, noise, stress and crime. City administrations look for solutions that fit for constrained budgets.\n\nOn the other hand, even the world\u2019s developed cities share enormous challenges in the near future: the world\u2019s economy has to fully decarbonize by 2050 to avoid a serious climate breakdown, and so far, not one city is _that_ clean and green. The 100 cities with the highest carbon emission footprint create about 20% of worldwide carbon emissions,<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup> and the highest-footprint cities that together host one billion people create about 63% of worldwide carbon emissions.<sup>[2](#footnote-2)</sup> This combination of a low number of entities with a high carbon footprint makes such cities the prime actors to avert a climate breakdown.\n\nNow what if there were a way to solve the infrastructure, pollution, carbon emission and social challenges of a city in a matter of 5-10 years, within the limits of the city\u2019s budget, and in such a way that the solution can survive the lack of national support and even a global economic crisis.\n\nThat is what this article is about: city-level economic autarky as a solution. In essence, it\u2019s about cities dropping out of the globalized world economy to solve all their challenges locally, while keeping connected to the world at large by exchanging knowledge, data and people.\n\nThis autarky applies foremost to cities with low to medium standard of living and serious infrastructure challenges, as the net increase in comfort will make citizens love autarky. But even in cities with a high standard of living, most proposals are possible if citizens are ecologically conscious. And most of the proposed solutions can also be adapted to local networks of villages and towns with a combined population of at least 50,000 people.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-2\">1.2. The unexplored potential of informed autarky</h3>\n\nAutarky, or self-sufficiency, has a reputation of being backwards. Especially in fast developing areas, people go to cities to escape the self-sufficient but \u201cprimitive\u201d life in villages with its hard work and inadequate supply of everything from household appliances to consumer goods and healthcare.\n\nHowever, the emergence of the Internet and scientific and technological progress in the last two decades has made a new form of autarky possible \u2013 just, it has yet to be tried in practice. Let's call it \u201cinformed autarky\u201d or maybe \u201csolarpunk autarky\u201d. It differs from straight-forward, village-style \u201cprimitive\u201d autarky in that it relies heavily on globalized knowledge, freely shared over the Internet. The mantra is \u201cglobalize knowledge, localize everything else\u201d.\n\nA frequent argument against autarky is \u201cBut how would you make your own microprocessors.\u201d But autarky comes in degrees: a community that can supply for itself with all consumable goods is already autarkic as far as everyday life is concerned. The 80/20 rule applied to autarky means: with 20% of effort you get 80% of the benefits of autarky. And in this paper, we focus on these low-hanging fruits \u2013 an obvious choice given that the whole area is unexplored so far.\n\nAn autarkic city is more similar to a large, well-functioning, worker-owned company than to a loose collection of households and businesses.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-3\">1.3. Problems that just vanish</h3>\n\nTo give a first glimpse of how an autarkic system can cut through the complex mess of problems that affect cities today, it is enlightening to consider what issues simply disappear as side effects of going autarkic:\n\n-   When external trade is not a major part of a city\u2019s economy (let\u2019s say \u22645% of GDP), the danger of economic turmoil due to conditions that can\u2019t be influenced or controlled by the city vanishes. Likewise, the necessity to attract foreign investment and industries with \u201cfavourable\u201d conditions with respect to tax and workforce vanishes.\n\n-   When you solve sanitation with a household-level technology like urine-separating dry toilets, the need for central wastewater processing plants vanishes. For cities without proper wastewater treatment, river pollution is greatly reduced. Also, domestic freshwater demand goes down a lot. The need to manufacture or import nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer is nearly eliminated because urine is perfect for both. It is utterly amazing how a technology as wasteful and damaging as the flush toilet is still in use.\n\n-   In an autarkic economy, full recycling is obligatory and necessarily local because no trash can be exported. Single-use plastics cannot be efficiently recycled, esp. not with small-scale local technology, so they will simply fall out of use. The same applies to single-use paper such as cardboard packaging and newspapers. All associated problems of freshwater pollution, ocean pollution, air pollution through incinerators etc. also vanish. With single-use plastics and paper gone and household composting in place, household trash collection becomes a simple affair. Volume will be so low that citizens can simply drop off a bucket at the neighbourhood recycling site every four weeks, or request the pickup of bulky items on demand.\n\n-   Because a local autarkic economy can\u2019t manufacture combustion engine vehicles, most air pollution vanishes. Electric bicycles and light electric vehicles can however be easily manufactured locally.\n\n-   With solar cells on every roof and demand management technology in every house, the need for central electricity plants and overland transmission lines vanishes.\n\n-   When streets are only for (free) public transportation, electric bicycles and a few licensed delivery vehicles, street congestion vanishes.\n\n-   When all products have to be manufactured within city limits to be sellable in the city, unemployment vanishes.\n\n-   When global trade supplies very little of what is consumed in a city, all the issues of how to manage transportation of products half around the world in a sustainable way simply disappear.\n\n-   When a city\u2019s citizens consume only products from local manufacturing, the city does no longer contribute to wealth and income inequality. Because the local companies will not be multinational businesses owned by billionaires.\n\n-   If a city does not allow the sale of goods or services by non-local companies, all advertisements by these have zero effect and are worth nothing. This will prevent future issues with data abuse, privacy breaches, AI ethics, excessive visual pollution etc..\n\n-   As infrastructure challenges are solved on the household and neighbourhood level, and as traffic is optimized down very seriously, a city becomes easily scalable: adding inhabitants will largely not strain central resources, because the city does not have these any more.\n\n-   By abolishing the consumption of outside resources, a city stops contributing to a multitude of outside environmental problems, such as deforestation due to palm oil plantations, environmental pollution through mining and oil spills etc..\n\n-   Since an autarkic economy is limited to the resources within city limits, internal market prices will be seriously affected, even to the point where recycling decades old trash from landfills becomes \u201cprofitable\u201d. Solving issues of long-term environmental pollution through landfill leaching. (Perhaps, collecting trash from the surrounding environment and oceans should be an exception from the resource autarky principle, since it is a net benefit to the cleaned-up environment.)\n\n-   Since an autarkic city has to self-limit its population size via immigration and birth rates, it automatically respects the carrying capacity. If applied the same way globally, it would obviously solve population and consumption overshoot.\n\n-   When autarky is implemented on the city scale, there is no need to wait for the much slower legislative process at the national scale to fix pressing global issues like climate change, species extinction and ecosystem degradation. Political deadlock vanishes. And if not for any other reason, all cities are compelled to switch as fast as possible to full autarky, because the dramatic ecological damage caused by the current economic system already puts the survival of the current human civilization at risk. Obviously, all national governments and individuals are likewise compelled to contribute their part to the solution, but fail short by far. In the current political deadlock, it even seems appropriate if city governments intentionally stretch and expand their assigned roles and responsibilities in order to transition to a sustainable economy in city borders. This would be considered a form of civil disobedience, which is already discussed as a necessary strategy by others to counter the ecological crisis.<sup>[3](#footnote-3)</sup>\n\n-   Autarkic cities are well positioned to weather many kinds of natural and man-made disasters, since changes in outside conditions like supply shortages, economic crises, inflation etc. affect them very little.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Design Principles for Small Autarkic Societies</h2>\n\n1.  **Reduce, reuse, recycle.** An estimated 80-90% of the progress towards autarky can be made by simply reducing household consumption, of everything from freshwater to electricity, clothing and other stuff. Reusable items for packaging etc. are a major way to reduce consumption. And finally, where consumption occurs, the scraps have to be fully recycled because an autarkic economy cannot produce (most) raw materials. It will have to cope with the raw materials available within city limits. Fortunately, glass, aluminium, copper, steel, plastics, synthetic fibres, gravel, sand, meltable stones and some natural materials like wood, bamboo etc. are readily available in cities and can be recycled permanently with city-scale technology.\n\n2.  **Design for well-being, not for commerce.** Autarky provides a different economic system: instead of competitive accumulation of capital, the goal is the well-being of all city inhabitants (humans, animals, plants). Commercial activity is a tool for that, not an end in itself.\n\n3.  **Keep it personal.** A city is still small enough for personal reputation, personal relationships and a craftsmanship relation to ones product to flourish. So for example, there should be a system by which producers place their \u201ctag\u201d on the parts they make \u2013 for example a self-selected unique word, similar to how graffiti artists do it. From that, lots of interesting conversations and proud craftsmanship will flourish when people come across their own products later at shops, at their friends houses etc.. This reverses the estrangement of people from the fruits of their labour, as defined by Marx.\n\n4.  **Mix and stir.** Over the long term, people will like a city where they know a diverse group of people and can easily meet new people. The autarky centres in each neighbourhoods and community work in its various forms, funded by the coupon based parallel economy, are great social mixers. Other ways include randomization of home locations by circular home swaps (with participants\u2019 approval of course).\n\n5.  **Make sure everyone\u2019s basic needs are cared for.** In other words, make sure nobody is punished for being poor \u2013 social cohesion benefits from high equality. An autarkic city can afford this for sure: it can receive community work via city taxes paid in-kind, and in an autarkic economy this community work can be turned into everything else, including homes for the homeless, food for the needy etc..\n\n6.  **Support the movement of people, but not of stuff.** This is the opposite of globalization, which promotes global trade but restricts the movement of people through visas etc.. An autarky is not a prison: the Autarkic City should look and feel inviting to everyone, esp. because it is a model to learn from. And people are free to come and go, move in and move out as they please. They should stay because they like the place, not because they can\u2019t escape. And certainly, if some people leave there will be enough others who move in to take their place.\n\n7.  **Keep the population within limits.** It is important to keep the city\u2019s population size from growing beyond the carrying capacity of the city\u2019s environment (esp. sunshine, water, wind) because an autarkic settlement cannot expand constructions to new areas: that would be appropriation of natural resources. It is equally important that the population does not fall below the level needed for the specializations and workforce for maintaining the autarky. Within these limits, the number does not matter because autarkic societies don\u2019t deteriorate the planet. Replacement by immigration is better than by birth though, because frankly, the planet is too full, and \u201cconsuming\u201d immigrants helps to solve that.<sup>[4](#footnote-4)</sup>\n\n     Practically, this means people might have to apply for becoming a resident of the city: just finding a place to live would not be enough, as landlords might cramp too many people into a house. They might even have to apply for having children, but a multitude of graceful ways is possible to compensate for unplanned pregnancy. For example, adjusting allowed immigration, or an insurance system that compensates those who can\u2019t have their application for children granted.\n\n8.  **Design a system, not just its parts.**\n\n9.  **Solve problems as local as possible.** If a problem can be solved at the household level, don\u2019t solve it at the neighbourhood or city level, and especially not on the regional, national or global level.\n\n10. **Waste no wind, sunshine or water.** Wind and sun provide energy, while water has to be replenished since it evaporates from plants. A city area received enough of all these (with the exception of water for some cities), so the quest is capturing every last bit of them and putting it to productive use.\n\n11. **Let nothing escape.** For an autarkic city, there is no waste: only when reusing everything, the city can permanently exist without importing new raw materials. The simplest way is to not let anything escape the city except for gases: water vapour and carbon dioxide. At the same time, this solves all issues with pollution of the surrounding environment.\n\n12. **Embrace physical mess and digital order.** Ordering things in the physical world is always expensive, but not so in the digital world. When transforming to an autarky setup, change and order things in the digital world to change how physical things work together. There is less of a need to change the physical things themselves. For example, there is no need to change houses or streets if houses have no proper addresses: simply use a system like \u201cWhat Three Words\u201d.\n\n13. **Open source everything.** This also means that everything will be properly documented online, allowing owners to do maintenance and repair themselves. Obviously, by providing all knowledge for free to the outside world, it does not influence the trade-to-GDP ratio, which keeps being a proper measure for autarky then.\n\n14. **Standardize everything.** Without the competition of a capitalist market economy, there is no incentive to create proprietary, incompatible products. Instead, develop standard product designs that are then produced by workshops across the city (and maybe across the world, as all designs will be shared in open source manner). It is fine to have various versions of products if they don\u2019t change too often \u2013 say, once in 5-10 years, so that the cost-saving effects of standard spare parts and repair procedures can be harvested. It is ok to have more frequent minor product releases if products can be physically \u201cupdated\u201d. Standardization is a huge cost saving opportunity, largely unexplored in consumer products in a capitalist society.\n\n15. **Time-intensive work is fine if done once.** Most products will take much longer to produce in an autarky setting, but that does not have to be a net disadvantage compared to big industry: since self-sufficiency is not a capitalist market economy, products are made only when needed and then are made to last and not to break. Using highly automated industrial production to create consumer products with a material efficiency of 1% after six months (fraction of products in use vs. total waste)<sup>[5](#footnote-5)</sup> is just a perverse waste of resources.\n\n16. **Don\u2019t stretch it too far.** There is no need to have a 100% autarky: a trade-to-GDP ratio of \u22645% is good enough, as both China and the Soviet union did not do much better than this even when they were pursuing autarky by state policy.<sup>[6](#footnote-6)</sup> If a higher degree of autarky in a certain area requires extreme investments into infrastructure, such as \u201ctwo dozen nuclear plants for heating \\[and\\] lighting\u201d<sup>[7](#footnote-7)</sup> for growing all food indoors in New York City \u2013 that\u2019s not the way to go. In such a case, accept that your city was not built with autarky in mind and focus on other areas where higher autarky can be achieved easily. For the difficult areas, use long-term urban planning to transform the city appropriately over time, for example by not constructing buildings in place of those that had to be torn down.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Autarky Technology for Cities</h2>\n\nThe following is just an outline and lists only a few of many options. The intention is to demonstrate that in all areas of human well-being, affordable technology is available to create and maintain local autarky.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Information system</h3>\n\nA city-wide participatory management portal for the city, including all of its autarkic economy, is a suitable backbone of an autarky system. The evolution of this software can provide huge efficiency gains over time without physical changes to anything else. Such an information system would comprise at least the following features:\n\n-   **City trade and logistics marketplace.** Facilitating reuse and recycling is a major way to avoid waste \u2013 means, the city will have fewer issues dealing with waste removal.\n\n-   **Non-monetary payment system.** The scarcity of money limits economic exchange and is the cause of unemployment in economic downturns. In an autarkic economy however, we need the contributions of everyone wanting to work. To solve this, set up a money-independent system for economic exchange. Use it for all affairs of the city administration (incl. payment of city taxes), and encourage citizens to use it themselves.\n\n     The system can be a complementary currency (\"trade dollars\"), but to take away any trust issues that citizens may have with how a currency is managed, better use a coupon based system. For example, there is PayCoupons,<sup>[8](#footnote-8)</sup> a system we are developing since 2012 for this purpose.\n\n-   **Community task management system.** This is like a municipal gig economy system, with payment in coupons and not in money. Note how this immediately solves unemployment, as the city government can provide as many tasks for the transformation of the city as they can think of, and pay for that with taxes raised in coupons from its citizens. Of course, citizens can also create tasks, so the system doubles as a citizen collaboration platform similar to FixMyStreet.<sup>[9](#footnote-9)</sup>\n\n    Since there will always be enough tasks to do, citizens stop worrying about losing their job, as they know they will find something to do if they need something. Of course, such a task management system can be used to organize community work on a massive scale: with proper documentation, lots of people can take part in road construction for a day, for example. Being physically involved in the construction and maintenance of their own city will give citizens a sense of ownership and belonging, with a multitude of positive social consequences flowing from that.\n\n-   **Trust and reputation system.** Cities are necessarily mostly anonymous since people can\u2019t know everyone there (limited by Dunbar\u2019s Number). But an information system can help with a standard way of managing trust and reputation, and that in turn allows unprecedented ways of collaboration. For example, citizens would get automatic access to various semi-public spaces and resources based on their user profile in the information system, for example machines from a tool library or a lock code for a podless shared bicycle. The information also makes it simple to evaluate whom to trust with jobs that require high trust (childcare, access to ones home or computer, medical and social care at home etc.).\n\n-   **Participatory budgeting system.** Let your citizens decide together how to modify the city.\n\n-   **Geoinformation system.** Every place-related information about the city would be available here to the public, from shop addresses to individual trees and the locations of cables and tubes.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Food</h3>\n\nGrow food on all flat surfaces: rooftops, front yards, backyards, public spaces, balconies. Even on the window sills indoors (a good place for kitchen greens). Grow food over all streets by having trees left, right, between lanes and on traffic islands. Grow climbing and hanging edible plants<sup>[10](#footnote-10)</sup> on all vertical surfaces: building walls, separation walls, fences, tree guards, tree stems etc.. Mandate that every house either has the roof covered with edible plants or solar panels. Also encourage bee keeping and mushroom production, which is possible in underground spaces without light.\n\nHave a policy that allows everyone to eat everything growing on public ground. Manage harvesting with the city's task management system, on busy streets as a night-time activity. Keep enough water reserves to water all of these plants in a multi-year drought.\n\nMandate that restaurants and markets must not throw away anything, and deploy the city\u2019s community workforce and small businesses to rescue, sort, distribute and preserve this food. Under autarky, the incentives for this stack up: the effort to utilize this food may be more than its world market price, but such a market price is irrelevant in a city that does not import food.\n\nThere will be very few livestock animals, but backyard chickens, goats as \u201clawn mowers\u201d that come to people\u2019s yards and some pigs to eat kitchen scraps are all possible. Still, people\u2019s diet will be low on meat, and that\u2019s a good thing as far as human health, food production efficiency and climate change is concerned.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Job and income guarantee</h3>\n\nThis is not an unconditional basic income but rather a job guarantee: all companies in a city would have to agree to list all low and medium skill tasks in a task portal and to accept everyone who applies with the right skills and reputation. Both skills and reputation would be managed in the city\u2019s information system, which see.\n\nAn income guarantee is important because it completely de-stresses people\u2019s lives: they can stop worrying that they may lose their job. They can also work in a flexible way (every day at another location depending on what work is available) if they prefer, with the freedom to not work if they don\u2019t need the additional income.\n\nThere would be a city-imposed minimum income and price limits for basic items so that a well-defined amount of work (ca. 16 hours per week) is enough for all basic needs. People would work more to supply for children, to work for \u201cluxury\u201d goods or experiences etc., but that\u2019s fully optional.\n\nA major way how a city can execute public works is to have a \u201ccommunity workforce\u201d, paid in people\u2019s coupons that the city gets directly or indirectly from city taxes. Such a workforce can do all kinds of unskilled and semi-skilled work, and people would only work there for a few days at a time. Organization would be semi-militarily so that every worker can navigate the organization easily when joining again, as it is clear and does not change much how it works internally. Possible work includes harvesting of fruit and nut trees in public space (and unused ones on private space), demolition of buildings, collecting trash, landscape gardening, street repair and maintenance, street cleaning for dust control, gardening in public space etc..\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-4\">3.4. Electricity</h3>\n\nAll buildings have locally owned, locally managed electricity generation by solar panels and biogas driven combustion motors (as backup), and also (optional) local battery storage. Together, they form a micro-grid. Batteries are of the lead-acid type with exchangeable plates and in standard sizes, as these can be fully recycled in a closed-loop local economy.\n\nGeneration and supply happens at 240 V DC \u2013 not a problem since the city is not connected to the national grid. This avoids the need for inverters, and both the existing cabling and most electrical devices will either work right away (resistive loads) or can be easily converted from 240 V AC.\n\nAnother option is to use 240 V square wave AC, which allows much simpler and cheaper inverters than traditional sinus-wave AC. Most loads will work with this without changes, but some electronics will have to be fitted with filters to avoid long-term damage. These filters have to be adjusted to the power draw and can take the shape of a plug adapter. The advantage is that people can keep using their devices on 240 V AC while travelling, without any changes.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-5\">3.5. Cooking and heating</h3>\n\nFor cooking, biogas is an attractive fuel. For its distribution, a low pressure network made from flexible plastic piping on poles would be a suitable option. Since the biogas would be generated at the house or block level, this piping is enough as it only occasionally has to transport gas between houses / blocks, namely where the local production is not enough. An interesting addition is to mix hydrogen into the biogas, made by electrolysis from excess photovoltaic electricity. This is possible up to 50% of hydrogen by volume without increased flammability, leakage and embrittlement risks.<sup>[11](#footnote-11)</sup>\n\nFuel combustion is currently the way heating is done. But with no fossil fuel and little burnable biomass available in an autarkic city, this becomes a problem in climates with a cold winter. Autarky is still possible by combining various unconventional and extreme solutions, such as:\n\n-   **Compost heating.** Build the house around a central 3x3 m column filled with compost.\n-   **Solar heating.** Vacuum tube type thermal solar collectors work even in the winter if there is clear sky.\n-   **Seasonal heat storage.** Using solar heat and storing it underground during the summer.\n-   **Heated clothing.** Together with highly insulating clothing of course, allowing to cope with lower environmental temperatures. Clothing can be heated electrically or with a small ethanol or gas flame.\n-   **Sleeping in dorms.** This means less space has to be heated during the night, and when properly insulated it may even heat itself given that each person emits about 100 W.\n-   **Smaller living quarters.** By preparing buildings to go without damage if not heating a part of them, a lot of fuel can be saved. It is even better to disuse some buildings completely and move to larger, more compact buildings for the winter, as these are more efficient to heat.\n-   **Stored biomass for biogas.** Biogas is difficult to store, but by drying and storing the biomass to make it from, seasonal energy storage is easily possible.\n-   **Extreme insulation.** Use extremely thick (1 m or more) locally made insulation to retrofit existing buildings. Options are plentiful, depending on the local situation: stone wool, waste plastic wool, plastic honeycomb sheets, straw bales etc..\n-   **Underground housing.**\n-   **House inside a greenhouse.**\n-   **Deadwood collection.** As a slight departure from autarky within city limits, deadwood collection from surrounding forests and its conversion to biochar for soil amendment in the city is possible because carbon removal is a net benefit to the environment. However, it is important to not take all dead biomass, leaving enough that will return nutrients to the soil and provide habitat for animals. Charring via constant volume flash carbonization or wood distillation creates carbon monoxide and methane as by-products, and these would be used for heating in the city.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-6\">3.6. Internet</h3>\n\nProvide a 2 Mbit\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup> Internet flat rate to every flat free of charge, and the same as a wifi connection in all streets and public spaces. Wifi coverage in streets can simply be done by letting everyone provide a guest wifi with the antenna behind a window.\n\nThe low speed encourages data efficient websites and avoids excessive data consumption in spite of a flat rate tariff. People who want a faster connection have to pay (for 2 hours, 8 hours, a full day, or any multiples of days).\n\nTo manage the network infrastructure, use the Guifi software. Connections will be a mix of Ethernet cabling, P2P VDSL cabling over cheap two-wire lines, and wireless connections over directional wifi. The network device hardware can be chosen to run open source software (already commercially available, see OpenWrt etc.) and in a later stage be locally developed open hardware made with standardized microcontrollers, FPGA chips and the like.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-7\">3.7. Water supply</h3>\n\nSeparate between potable and non-potable water. Allow people to harvest rainwater from all their premises for free. Also allow them to draw the non-potable water from on-site wells for free, but only to a certain limit per year (with a water meter on the pump). This encourages frugal use of the water. Adjust the limit as needed to prevent the groundwater table from dropping.\n\nProvide potable water in 20 l jars through the logistics system. Some people may also opt to purify their own water on-site from the well.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-8\">3.8. Wastewater</h3>\n\nProhibit the sale of any not fully biodegradable household detergent within city limits. The largest source of wastewater is removed by replacing all flush toilets with separating dry toilets. All remaining wastewater is biodegradable graywater or contaminated water (with chemicals, pharmaceuticals or oil). Let every house install a graywater treatment plant and use the residue for watering the part of the garden grown in closed containers to prevent groundwater contact. Collect contaminated wastewater to be evaporated at a neighbourhood facility, with the remains burned in high temperatures.\n\nThen, remove household connections to the city's wastewater plumbing system. It is no longer needed (or you could re-purpose it for robots that provide automatic delivery of small packages \u2026).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-9\">3.9. Solid waste</h3>\n\nMandate that items can only be sold without or in re-usable packaging. Standardize various types of re-usable packaging that circulate freely and without payments, esp. glass jars for food and boxes for parcel shipments. People may stockpile and use some at home, but that is no long-term issue as everyone has only a limited amount of space at home and will return unused containers to circulation if they are sure they can also get them again when they want them.\n\nAll designs for locally manufactured open source products will try hard to cope with a limited amount of raw materials according to a local standard: various thermoplastics, aluminium, cast iron, steel, stainless steel, titanium, copper, glass, and biodegradable materials. Because all of these can either be recycled with minimal losses, or regrown in nature.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-10\">3.10. Traffic</h3>\n\nMandate a speed limit of 25 km\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup> in city limits. It won't slow down delivery workers since driving is not what they do most of the time, it won't slow down e-bicycles by much, it won't slow down the occasional heavy vehicles on a busy street, and all other traffic is discouraged anyway. It will however severely limit injuries in accidents, as both braking distance and kinetic energy is a quarter of that of a 50 km\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup> vehicle. Also, cyclists will feel safer.\n\nLet bicycles, cargocycles and velomobiles, with and without electric assist, take over the street by discouraging all other forms of transportation. (You could also allow electric scooters, but e-bicycles at least allow to pedal, which is certainly a health benefit.) Full-body velomobiles are also great \u2013 mostly for protection in rain and snow, not for speed reasons, as distances in the city are quite short anyway. A semi-podless sharing system for electrical and non-electrical bicycles and scooters seems the most DIY and most energy efficient option. Each would be GPS tracked so its position is visible on a map to the next users. Pods would be the preferred positions for the electrical bicycles because it allows to charge them. Usage fees would be by time \u2013 in coupons of course.\n\nFor elderly and disabled users, there would be various specialized electric light vehicles: with three or four wheels, incl. purely electric versions, those with a full cover, and those that can be used with a wheelchair.\n\nEveryone has a right to work from home if this is reasonably possible. It is possible for all office workers for sure, but even for a good amount of assembly workers who can get parts and tools delivered to their home. This reduces traffic and the need for other services like child daycare. Similarly, school children would only go to school a few days a week and otherwise learn at home, or with their peers in the local neighborhood.\n\nFor cargo transportation, there would likewise be electrically assisted cargo cycles in various shapes and sizes, available for everyone to rent. Only for the most heavy loads (containers), there would be traditional trucks with combustion engines. They would only be allowed to drive at night, at low speeds, and on locally manufactured biogas. Converting petrol and diesel engines to biogas is possible with local means; in the case of diesel the biogas will be used as a co-fuel while still requiring 10% of the original amount of Diesel for ignition. That 10% can however be fully covered by locally produced biodiesel, given that heavy load transportation will be an exceptional case.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-11\">3.11. Logistics</h3>\n\nA reliable and fast logistics system is the most important solution for congested streets: it must be simpler, faster and cheaper to order something shipped through the logistics system than to pick it up. The city would have standardized, re-usable packaging for this logistics system, locally manufactured from recycled plastic. Houses would have street-side parcel boxes where the delivery service drops off and picks up the parcels. Addressing will be done with a digital record connected to a QR code that identifies a packaging container.\n\nLogistics does not have to be centralized, but coordinated: people register to serve a certain area at a certain time, take the vehicle for that, and do the pickup and delivery drive. All houses should be served four times a day (early morning, noon, end of business, late evening). A software would guarantee that this happens, where necessary by activating \u201cemergency reserve\u201d workers, for a higher fee obviously.\n\nThe logistics system is the backbone of the city\u2019s collaborative economy and of its supply and waste management system. For example, human excrements from the urine separating dry toilet are also transported via this logistics system. Likewise, potable water, biogas bottles etc.. Companies would send parts for assembly to people\u2019s home, and semi-finished products as raw materials to other companies. Companies and households would get rented tools delivered from a central magazine, and send them back after use. Even trash collection would be done by this logistics system, given that household trash volumes will be very low (no plastic packaging, local composting, widespread renting and resale of products).\n\nIf the company has a connection to the train network, it is advisable to remove all motorable roads going into and out of the city. This way, others simply can\u2019t come with their combustion engine vehicles to pester the city\u2019s air.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-12\">3.12. Industry</h3>\n\nLocal industries have to produce all physical products needed in the city, and also contribute their share to the global development of immaterial products (content, databases, software). All of these will be open source, and no product can be sold without having its design files published in open source manner on a collaborative development portal. Manufacturers of competing designs have to work out a common design over time to not duplicate efforts.\n\nMost manufacturing will be in small batches to refill stocks, or made-to-order for rarely needed products. All designs have to be adapted for complete recycling and re-usability of as many components as possible (means, products must use as few custom parts as possible). For example, there might be a standard that electronically controlled products either have to use an Arduino or Raspberry Pi board for control.\n\nManufacturing should mostly rely on computer-controlled machines (3D printers, CNC mills etc.) because that brings in the efficiency of automation even for small-batch and single piece manufacturing. It also reduces the need for worker skills, and is less drudgery.\n\nMultiple specialized workshops have to work together to create the individual parts of a product and then to assemble it. This can be nicely organized with a distributed manufacturing platform: when a new products is ordered, the system splits it into orders for the individual workshops automatically.\n\nUsers can (and are expected) to provide feedback and bug reports to products they use, via an issue tracker in the product development portal. Product development is not a local affair, though, as designs are shared and replicated globally to save efforts. Each city may only care for a few products.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-13\">3.13. Sharing Systems</h3>\n\nThe household level is not always the most efficient solution in terms of material use, energy use, system complexity and maintenance effort. In spite of this, household solutions are currently still used where people can't afford to pay somebody else for the work. This changes in a city economy with a coupon based no-deadlock economy where everyone is guaranteed work at all times. It allows neighbourhood level or city level services for example for:\n\n-   clothing pickup, washing and delivery\n-   communal kitchen, with dining out or home delivery\n-   tool magazine, with home delivery and pickup\n-   clothing lending (it\u2019s ok to have a different outfit every weekend if it\u2019s not yours \u2013 because then it\u2019s not consumption)\n-   furniture lending (no need to own furniture you only need for a party, for guests etc.)\n-   cold storage as a service, with pickup and delivery\n-   processing of home-grown food (pickling, juicing, drying, smoking etc.)\n-   flexible flat sharing (a cheap option to live for those with just a suitcase of stuff; they join others to occupy flats that are temporarily unused because their regular users might be out of town)\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-14\">3.14. Education</h3>\n\nAs far as public schools are obligatory, there will be little way around them, but cities may be able to influence them to various degrees through teacher selection, provision of buildings and facilities, and collaboration on projects for the students. It may also be able to reverse some of the damage dome in public schools by offering voluntary, enjoyable after-school activities of all sorts.\n\nHowever, after the obligatory schooling (around 9 years in most countries), students are free to continue their education in a different way, and the city can support that. As a rough proposal, students would be encouraged to take part in on-the-job education in all kinds of roles and tasks in the autarkic economy, while getting further background knowledge from open source study materials to read and watch in self-study. Learning something by heart is only needed in exceptional cases, as online knowledge is always at hand. Students should however prove (mostly to themselves but also for the reputation system) that they understood what they study by taking short online tests after each chapter. Students would proceed in this way until finding what they want to specialize in more deeply, and after committing to a field would then be assigned a mentor to guide their studies alongside working on real-world projects in this field.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-15\">3.15. Healthcare</h3>\n\nTo be on the safe side, take the healthcare system as it is and only improve it with open source, locally made solutions. If the city has no hospital, that implies building a hospital. Another way, so far unexplored, are the potential health and cost benefits of collecting, sharing and evaluating local health-related data. For example, it may reveal the locally prevalent stems of bacteria in infections, allowing better targeting with antibiotics than by following general advice for first-line treatment. Additionally, patient quarantine is an underused way to limit disease load: when people are not forced to work due to urgent financial needs and the quarantine place is nice and relaxing, they can enjoy it as a voluntary vacation time. Software may track contact between people and, depending on the disease, quarantine them or inform them to self-quarantine at the onset of any symptoms.\n\nAdvanced medical treatments and pharmaceuticals are still out of the reach of autarkic production for some time. So, the city can provide a health insurance system mostly relying on its own hospital, but in cases where outside treatment is required, the insurance would cover that in legal tender currency. Still, contributions to the health insurance would be possible to be paid in coupons, and only optionally in money.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-16\">3.16. Art and Aesthetics</h3>\n\nThere is a surprisingly important role for artists and designers to make an autarkic city a success story. For a success, citizens have to like their city, which includes its aesthetics. Now with limited local manufacturing abilities and the requirement of a circular economy, all products will have a rougher finish and be made from a more restricted choice of materials. To still have pleasing aesthetics, it needs the input of gifted artists and designers. They will certainly explore how to utilize the unique additional abilities of an autarkic economy: unique designs for each item due to digital manufacturing, participatory design processes, shared design elements and even color schemes between all products etc..\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-17\">3.17. Research</h3>\n\nResearch can be funded from city taxes and voluntary donations, both in coupons. But, funded research will be strictly utilitarian, given that autarkic cities will have urgent practical issues to resolve for the next decades. This is ensured by letting funders vote on research proposals made by the researchers. Delegate voting can be employed.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-18\">3.18. Tourism</h3>\n\nAll hotels are phased out and converted to apartment flats. Private individuals are obliged to offer excess rooms and encouraged to offer temporary beds in their flats to tourists and travellers. This prevents the conversion of whole flats for accommodating guests, and also removes the extreme inefficiency of hotels.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-19\">3.19. Ecosystem Restoration</h3>\n\nThe closer a city is to a self-sustaining wilderness ecosystem, the better. At least the following elements should be restored over time:\n\n-   **soil:** you can't have enough soil, ever; compost all biomass within city limits, mix it with biochar, sand and crushed stones to make soil, and supply that as planting soil for cheap to households and farms for their gardening purposes; keep all soil under plant cover to prevent wind and water erosion\n-   **carbon capture:** creating biochar from biomass that is then used as a 10% soil amendment\n-   **soil detoxification:** many heavy metals and organic compounds can be extracted with \"hyperaccumulator\" plants\n-   **water table:** use groundwater infiltration and extreme water saving and water reuse in order to restore the groundwater table to 1-2 m below the surface, providing a valuable backup in times of drought\n-   **native plants and trees:** mix them thoroughly with all the planting of edible plants\n-   **insects:** don't let anyone use chemical pesticides in city limits; provide a wealth of flowering plants for bees and insects; where necessary breed and release certain insects in greenhouses; mandate that no artificial lighting is used outdoors after sundown, as it attracts insects who then get trapped and die \u2013 rather, people should simply use flashlights and headlights\n-   **other animals:** provide habitats, esp. large quiet parks\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. How to Transform Your City</h2>\n\n1.  **Join the alliance of autarkic cities.** Sharing knowledge is the key to low-cost and effective autarky solutions, so joining forces is the first step.\n\n2.  **Soft-launch autarky as a non-monetary economy.** It is essential that citizens understand and support the autarkic transformation of their city. The most attractive way to explain it to them is by launching a parallel economy based on a coupon system where everyone can find compensated work and all work contributes to the common good. We already provide such a system with PayCoupons<sup>[12](#footnote-12)</sup> that you can then deploy in your city while developing the city\u2019s full information system alongside.\n\n3.  **Start a membership system for early adopters of autarky solutions.** Tell your citizens that each autarky solution will become mandatory only once it is mature, which can be after anything from 1-15 years after starting its development. Tell them that they can enjoy the benefits faster and contribute as test users to the development when they sign up for the membership. In the ideal case, people will all sign up voluntarily due to word of mouth about cost savings, job guarantee etc., and there will be no need to force anyone when the time for general deployment of a solution comes.\n\n4.  **Let each neighbourhood found an autarky centre.** Because a lot of autarky is best managed at the neighbourhood level. In addition, people getting to know their neighbours has many positive social consequences. The autarky centre must be a physical building in that neighbourhood.\n\n5.  **Solve the city\u2019s worst infrastructure issue.** Acceptance by citizens will be best if you replace what is worst working with an autarkic solution first.\n\n6.  **Get your schools and universities to work on autarky technology.** In their exercise projects, they can all contribute, and if only by improving documentation of systems that already exist. You need all the workforce you can get because most autarky solutions are not yet developed, so start with those who currently waste their time with useless assignments.\n\n7.  **Ban advertising.** Long-term exposure to advertising degrades people\u2019s happiness and promotes excessive consumption. All products available in a small autarkic economy are from local manufacturing, and these companies will have neither a reason nor the money to advertise beyond the business\u2019s name over their entrance. There is zero reason to advertise, since all local services and products will be listed in an online directory. Eliminating exposure to advertising from the surrounding national and global economy will be a bit more difficult, but: make people hate ads by demonstrating their adverse effects, and then provide them with free ad-removal service. That means somebody comes to their home and installs ad-blockers in their browser and TV (the latter replacing ads with filler material according to timing information obtained live from the Internet).\n\n8.  **Set up a city-wide automatic insurance to fix risk anxiety.** Everyone moving to the city will have to sign a contract that they agree that all claims are covered by a payout from that insurance.\n\n9.  **Deal with existing industries.** This is one of the more difficult decisions: what to do with heavily export dependent industries that already are in the city? Certainly, some of them have to be closed down by all means, esp. fossil fuel extraction businesses, factory animal farms and non-organic agriculture. Others could be upgraded to be a net benefit to the environment, such as well-managed recycling businesses. They would be allowed to operate, but without mixing its material flows with the autarkic economy: whatever raw materials they bring in they have to ship out in products and waste materials.\n\n\n## Footnotes\n\n<a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>**1** See: \u201cNew study estimates the carbon footprints of 13,000 cities\u201d, <https://phys.org/news/2018-05-carbon-footprints-cities.html>\n\n<a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>**2** See: \u201cCarbon footprints of 13,000 cities\u201d, <https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aac72a>, figure 3.\n\n<a name=\"footnote-3\"></a>**3** See for one article of many that articulates this: <https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/31/law-breaker-save-planet-direct-action-civil-disobedience> . Of course, there are often creative ways to avoid de jure overstepping a city government\u2019s abilities. For example, if national laws requires a city to allow people driving fuel combusting cars on nationally administered streets through city boundaries, the city can still block each and every connection from there to its own roads. Logically, the street will no longer be part of the city\u2019s traffic infrastructure.\n\n<a name=\"footnote-4\"></a>**4** The range between minimum and maximum capacity should be a factor of 2 or more.

Webinar \"Knowing the Problem\":\nThe first Meeting offered a very interesting discussion with some great FOSS activists with firm tech backgrounds. During the last week, @Emile and @felix.wolfsteller have explored the situation of It and opensource education in their regions (see posts below). DIscussing those findings and the connected questions such as **\"Do they (the \"end users\" (Teachers, students, etc. ) know there is a problem?\"**\nWE will try to invite some experts from the teaching background and discuss further the direction and form off an approach to further Opensource in teaching.\n@Emile, maybe you could also talk a bit about sustainability for Open source projects?  [how to make opensource projects sustainable](https://edgeryders.eu/t/economic-sustainability-for-open-source-projects/12082) @Emile, would be great to have you there! \n\n# 3. Webinar \"Working together!\"\nIn the third discussion, we want to sketch out a concrete plan for further collaboration via an intensive full-day workshop and whom to invite to that event. \n@erik_lonroth, looking forward to see this project and your workshops grow! \n\nor the FOSS environment (@felix.wolfsteller, what do you think would be a good topic?) \n\nPlease add those interested in the topic and those who should become interested :):\nping @MatsK, @unclecj, @asimong, @matthias would you also be interested in joining and maybe contributing or inviting some more people? \n\nEdgeryders Team is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.\n\nTopic: Biweekly Community Calls\nTime: 28th Jan, 11th of Feb, 25th of Feb, 18:00 CET (every second Tuesday)\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://zoom.us/j/3063210325\n\nMeeting ID: 306 321 0325\n\n### How is this all financed?\n\nThis event is part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016.

We can then reach out to our network to find the right people\n[/quote]\n\nTwo points from me:\n1) Since our conversations on the platform span so many different topics and different qualities of content - it would be useful to have curators of each providing a benchmark for the kind of publication we have in mind. Is it high quality journalism, like the better stories on the platform (example - [This CTO has lived off the grid in his truck for several years \u2014 here\u2019s why](https://edgeryders.eu/t/this-cto-has-lived-off-the-grid-in-his-truck-for-several-years-here-s-why/10801))? or more spontaneous stories? The former would need editorialising efforts (see point 2) below) For the latter it could be easier:\nI really like this format organised by an indie magazine called 'Only a Magazine' (transl. from Romanian 'Decat o Revista'): they crowdsource stories from readers:\n- mini love stories about love in quarantine: https://www.dor.ro/mini-povesti-de-iubire-in-carantina/\n\n- letters from readers and how they cope with covid 'Pandemic Diary' style: https://www.dor.ro/cum-mai-e-prin-vietile-noastre-povesti-de-la-cititori/\n\n\n2) The campaign would need to articulate the benefits for contributors - especially if we are looking for new content, not just existing ones. Many good stories might exist in stub forms, in a comment here and there. I suspect some editing effort is needed, and it would be good to reward contributors.", "created_at": "2020-04-21 09:02:38.098771", "updated_at": "2020-04-21 09:03:33.580857", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 281, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 28.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [74684], "is_reply_to": [74684], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74494, "user_id": 6427, "topic_id": 12845, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Those of you who are saying -- you are just going to shut it all off because you don't know who to trust -- that's a much better attitude than feeling certain you know who to trust when in fact you don't really know. Knowing that you don't know is a big advance over thinking you know when you don't.\n\nI am in a different situation -- being a VERY math/stats-oriented person I don't get stressed out at all by the statistical posts; I love reading them because I do feel I can understand the math and evaluate what they're saying. And to be honest, how reliable an analysis is doesn't always correlate with credentials -- for the most part, actual epidemiologists talking about this situation are largely saying things that make sense mathematically -- but not always. The \"experts\" mostly but not entirely agree, so if you can't evaluate the arguments yourself you can't just look at the credentials to decide. Similarly, that dude with the Medium post might well be spewing BS but in fact might be quite astute -- I've seen both, in large quantities, during all this. I've been reading a lot of articles that say something like \"if you aren't an epidemiologist, just stop posting about this and leave it to the experts\". Yet, the \"experts\" are mostly but not 100% in agreement either; there are some greatly varying outlier views amongst them. And quite honestly among the non-credentialed, there are some making very good arguments and some making convincing sounding but awful arguments.\n\nI don't know the answer to this. What I will say is this: if you are starting from a position of knowing you don't know, you're already better off than most, as I said above. From there, however, I will say one more thing: you CAN understand it, if you really want to, if you have the humility to know you don't know, the amount of work it would take to be able to figure out for yourself what is and isn't credible here is actually within the reach of almost everyone. What's missing isn't the ability to understand, but the critical capacity to realize what you don't yet understand and put in the energy and concentration to figure it out. That's true of most things, really, but certainly here.\n\nHowever, if you're strongly WANTING to believe one particular story, you're not going to be able to get there. And I'd say a large number of people do have a very strong motivation, conscious or not, to want to believe one story or another. It is difficult to really get to the bottom of anything with that sort of mindset.\n\nTo get back to the question however -- what is to be done? Is there a better way of discussing this stuff? I really do wonder this. What does seem to be happening though is that slowly, over time, the \"expert\" consensus does seem to be converging on a sensible picture of what is going on, what is likely to happen next, and what are the likely best ways to deal with it. I have been heartened by this; yet online, there is still a flood of misinformation, bad analysis, bogus interpretations of data, and motivated reasoning.

I read Stephen Witt's book How Music Got Free last year, and it really resonated with my relation to technology throughout my life. There was a period when it seemed reasonable that users could build world communities around common causes, and self-moderate -- in fact, I've read fairly elaborate academic studies applying Elinor Ostrom's commons management framework to conceps like torrent trackers (large anonymous communities that nevertheless seem to govern a common resource, the torrent pool with seeders and leechers, equitably) -- but it's also fairly clear that users, by and large, choose to self-organize around activities that do not conform with old-economy expectations.\n\nSo mobile phones are for sure contributing to a consumption, rather than a \"pro-sumption\" (if you permit me reviving this 2005 adage), culture, but for good reason: consumer society is better adapted to the norms that have prevailed and around which society's desired information governance and markets is structured.

I am looking forward to meeting you again during the event. \n\nYour perspective on the coworking scene is extremely interesting. \nThrough you partnership with 4000 spaces partners and even more on your platform you can see patterns and developments on a large scale. \n\nAnd now your whole team is able to connect that with their own direct experiences of distributed work and the impact of the current situation on their lives. \n\n### The secound on the UN principles for sustainable City planning is: \n> 2. MIXED LAND USE AND LIMITED LAND-USE SPECIALIZATION\n> Mixed-use development is aimed at developing a range of compatible land uses and functions\n> and provides a cross section of residential, commercial and community infrastructure in a building,\n> block or neighbourhood while reducing the demand for commuter travel by reducing the distances\n> between the vertices of the so-called \u2018home-work-services\u2019 triangle, and facilitating agglomeration\n> economies. Translated in guidelines, it proposes that at least 40% of total floor space should be\n> allocated for economic use both on the city and neighborhood level plans and designs. It also\n> recommends to minimize single function blocks to not more than 10% of total land use. \n\n### In our interview you stated:\n\n> \"So it is possible that some of the bigger players that we\u2019re used to seeing might be acquired by someone else. That is probably going to be the future. However, as much as they were hit hard and we lost a lot of spaces, and we\u2019ll continue to lose spaces over the year, coworking is going to come back stronger than ever. It\u2019s going to be needed more than ever. That is because of the transition of companies coming away from the headquartered model, wanting a more flexible lease and also this huge realization that, \u201cYes, we can work remotely. I don\u2019t need to have my team all in one space, five days a week, eight hours a day.\u201d\"\n\n### and in view of technology you stressed the influence and importance of technology providers:\n\n> \"With regards to technology and how that interacts, there\u2019s a lot of ways that coworking spaces are using technology in order to mitigate certain issues or just make the experience a lot more simplified. So we\u2019re of course looking to do integrations in the future, but there are inventory controls where they can put those online and have providers like us be able to tap into their inventory of what\u2019s available in their space, whether it be meeting rooms, private offices or hot desking. There is also accessibility options. Using keyless entry, you can do that through the app, and that can be integrated with their own systems that are in their buildings. So people can walk in and have a touchless system, and they know that that person has entered the building through those integrations.\"\n\n### And you also remarked on the new experiences of companies during covid:\n\n> \"Not only that these companies are experiencing remote work for the first time, in some cases because all of their teams were just sent home to work, and they\u2019re trying to navigate how Zoom works and how they can still run their companies without being in each other\u2019s space. Right? All of that happened, which immediately created inquiries for us and how companies are planning for the future.\"\n\nTherefore I have two questions for you:\n\n## 1. *Do you think remote working technology development and developers should be more involved in city planning efforts, e.g. when governments or municipalities plan the future?*\n\n## 2. *Can you already see some changes in how companies/private businesses (among your clients) start to change their plans of the future, like going for hubs instead of headquarters or hiring in different areas?\"*", "created_at": "2020-07-13 08:52:04.845368", "updated_at": "2020-07-13 08:52:16.064033", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 635, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84267, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14513, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Tomorrow, will send you doc in pm", "created_at": "2020-10-03 12:04:56.022406", "updated_at": "2020-10-03 12:04:56.022406", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [84266], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5908, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5875, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\">Websites</h2>\n\nhttps://arablit.org/category/science-fiction/\n\nhttp://www.islamscifi.com/\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Authors</h2>\n\nMuslim Science Fiction authors and also authors who have written about Islamic themes in Science Fiction.

Choosing the right software for a commune](#heading--3)**\n\n------\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. Lists of software applications</h2>\n\nAs for the software applications that I found, and what they can do, here is the list. It is roughly sorted by quality and adequateness for the purpose outlined above. Nearly all of it is open source, but there are a few exceptions where it seemed appropriate.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-1\">1.1. Full-featured applications for general-purpose resource scheduling and booking</h3>\n\nThe idea with this list is that you can just install one of these and configure it to your needs for managing any not-too-specialized case of resource scheduling or booking, including event and room booking. No need to change the code, just configure it.\n\n* **[Booked Scheduler](https://github.com/effgarces/BookedScheduler)**. Clearly the most advanced resource scheduling software that is available as free and open source software \u2013 see the [live demo](https://demo.bookedscheduler.com/Web/).\n\n    Unfortunately the development of the [original Booked Scheduler](https://www.bookedscheduler.com/) open source project has ceased at 2020-11-01: \"Booked Scheduler has become a full SaaS offering on November 1, 2020. The open source project will be discontinued.\" ([source](https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpscheduleit/files/)). The original repository and releases have since been removed. So the link above goes to a fork that intends to continue maintenance of Booked Scheduler in a limited way, while also calling for others in the user community to assist.\n\n    The programming language is PHP, with a (good quality but still) self-developed framework and the Smarty template engine. So the base technology is somewhat legacy, which means this software only makes sense to use when it matches your use case without major modifications.\n\n    Features include time slot based booking, resource status, resource time blocking (when used internally), reports and statistics, detailed access rights, optional booking for guests, e-mail notifications, check-in / check-out (allowing to re-list resources that are not used during their booked times), custom fields, custom calendar coloring rules, and many other features.\n\n    Starting with Booked Scheduler 2.7 Beta, there is also direct payment integration with Stripe and PayPal \u2013 see the [release announcement](https://nickkorbel.com/2018/05/03/booked-2-7-is-out-in-beta/). It works via a system of \"user credits\" that users purchase and can then spend on bookings in the platform. It sounds in the release announcement that buying credits and spending them on a reservation is also possible in one process, but I did not test that yet. In addition, payment integration is available as a third-party plugin ([CashFlowProducts PayPal Payments for Reservations](https://cashflowproducts.com/product.php?prodId=OLP-P)), though I am not yet sure how much this relies on the internal credit system as well. Finally, you could modify the software yourself to add this ([some pointers](http://php.brickhost.com/forums/index.php?topic=2622.0)). \n\n    A large support forum with many tips, tricks and mods is available at [php.brickhost.com/forums](http://php.brickhost.com/forums). A third-party developer offers [various add-ons and plugins](https://cashflowproducts.com/shop.php).\n\n* **[leihs](https://github.com/leihs/leihs).** A mature, open source, Ruby on Rails based application for equipment booking and lending, in use by several universities. A [demo](https://github.com/leihs/leihs/wiki#live-demo) is provided, but was broken 2019-01-13.\n\n* **[Reservations](https://github.com/YaleSTC/reservations).** An open source, Ruby on Rails based application for equipment booking and lending. Developed by the [Student Developer and Mentorship Program](http://yalestc.github.io/) at Yale University, which provides students with practical software development experience, with useful outsomes.\n\n* **[Odoo based booking software](https://www.odoo.com/apps/modules/browse?search=booking).** [Odoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoo), earlier known as OpenERP, is an open source modular business management app. Among the many user-contributed components are multiple small booking solutions. See also directly on Github: [Odoo booking solutions](https://github.com/search?q=odoo+booking&type=Repositories) / [OpenERP booking solutions](https://github.com/search?q=OpenERP+booking).\n\n* **[ERPNext](https://erpnext.com/) based booking software.** This is another ERP system written in Python, and like Odoo it can be extended with modules. Nothing really mature seems to exist for reservations and booking, but there are some solutions around: [hospitality module](https://erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/hospitality), [franknyarkoh/bookings](https://github.com/franknyarkoh/bookings), [jigartarpara/bookingapp](https://discuss.erpnext.com/t/40823) and possibly more.\n\n* **[Seantis Reservation](https://github.com/seantis/seantis.reservation).** A quite full-featured reservation system written in Python. So for everyone looking for an open source solution that's _not_ PHP, this would be it. The software is a plugin for the Plone CMS (which [is a turn-off](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=plone)), but geared towards being independent of it at some time ([see](https://github.com/seantis/seantis.reservation#why-did-you-choose-sql-anyway-why-not-use-the-zodb-why-not-insert-your-favorite-nosql-db-here)).\n\n    Seantis Reservation can serve multiple use cases: booking various resources like classes, meeting rooms, tables etc. online with optional confirmation and an optional waiting list. There is no direct integration of online payments, but [a process with admin-only form fields](https://pypi.org/project/seantis.reservation/#id28) that allow to manually mark a reservation as \"paid\" once the payment has been received.\n\n* **[APR](https://github.com/moshthepitt/apr).** \"APR is an appointment / event booking and reminder system made with Python and Django.\" So meant to be generic, and could be mature enough. Also, it allows integration with many other software components since it's based on Django. In active development as of 2018-12.\n\n* **[WP Booking Calendar](http://wpbookingcalendar.com/).** The most advanced resource scheduling / booking plugin for WordPress. Not open source software, but both free and commercial versions are available. Can be used for rooms and any other bookable resource. Payment integration and time-slot based booking is only available in the commercial \"Small Business\" version (149 USD) and higher. See also its [WordPress plugin homepage](https://wordpress.org/plugins/booking/).\n\n* **[EDD Bookings](https://eddbookings.com/features/).** A WordPress plugin for booking appointments. Similar to Easy!Appointments, but with payment integration. Still in active development. Though the software is sold on the website, it is [licenced GPL3](https://github.com/RebelCode/eddbk/blob/develop/LICENSE) and the code is available publicly: [backend](https://github.com/RebelCode/eddbk), [JavaScript frontend](https://github.com/RebelCode/bookings-js), [other stuff](https://github.com/RebelCode).\n\n* **[BookingKitti](https://github.com/BookingKitti/bookingkitti).** A resource booking system written in JavaScript (Node.js) as the final project in software engineering by a group of students at a Chinese university. 582 commits. Not sure if any calendar library is used here.\n\n* **[PHP Booking Calendar](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bookingcalendar/).** Free and open source software. No longer in development since 2014.\n\n* **[phpmyreservation](https://github.com/olejon/phpmyreservation).** Free and open source software. But rather small and simple.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-2\">1.2. Full-featured applications for room / accommodation booking</h3>\n\n* **[Modernomad](https://github.com/embassynetwork/modernomad).** A combined room booking, event management and member management software, developed for and used by the [Embassy Network](https://embassynetwork.com/). Which is a network of \"experimental\" co-living locations. The software supports multiple locations / houses. Written in Python.\n\n* **[Trustroots](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots).** A mature software written in JavaScript, run by the [trustroots.org](https://www.trustroots.org) hospitality community for travellers. Not for commercial / paid room booking, obviously.\n\n* **[OxAlto Room Booking System](https://github.com/neokoenig/RoomBooking).** Judging from [the demo](http://roombooking.oxalto.co.uk/), it's quite a nice, functional, simple software. It used the FullCalendar widget, and resources can be filtered in a two-level menu at the top of the calendar. Sadly, it's written in [ColdFusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language), which should be considered obsolete.\n\n* **[Qloapps](https://qloapps.com/).** Free and open source software. Specialized booking system for hotels etc., with payment integration etc.. Built as an extension for the open source Prestashop e-commerce software.\n\n* **[Room Booking System](https://github.com/julia-/room-booking-system).** \"A room booking system built with MongoDB, Express, Node.js and ReactJS.\" 474 commits.\n\n* **[Meeting Room Booking System](http://mrbs.sourceforge.net/).** Free and open source software, but no longer in active development (seemingly). Also, rather simple. Source code [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mrbs/).\n\n* **[LoungeSearch](https://github.com/Alspirid/Lounge-search).** Similar to CouchSurfing / BeWelcome, but much less complex.\n\n* **[BeWelcome](http://trac.bewelcome.org/).** The open source software of the well-known hospitality platform. Mature, but unfortunately PHP. See [here on Github](https://github.com/BeWelcome/rox).\n\n* **[HotelManagementSystem](https://github.com/andrew-it/HotelManagementSystem).** Allows to select and book from one of multiple hotels, similar to booking.com. Written in Python, using the Flask micro-framework.\n\n* **[crypto-booking](https://github.com/windingtree/crypto-booking).** JavaScript based application to book accommodation on the WindingTree blockchain DAPP, paying with Ethereum and the like. It seems well-developed (and a well-resourced project), so perhaps the JavaScript frontend can be reused.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-3\">1.3. Full-featured applications for other types of resource scheduling and booking</h3>\n\nThey are not directly adequate for managing a room booking system for one house. For example, they might be made for multiple houses (like booking.com) or are specialized systems for events or other types of bookings. But they are mature, full-featured applications.\n\n* **[FabManager](https://www.fab-manager.com/?lang=en).** A software to manage all aspects of a Fablab / makerspace / hackerspace or other type of digital fabrication workshop. Includes room booking, tool booking, event booking, payment integration, tool documentation, and project publishing in a repository that is federated between all FabManager installations. See the [source code](https://github.com/sleede/fab-manager) and an [online demo](https://demo.fab-manager.com/). Written in Ruby, and using [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) for its calendar widget (which is the best choice).\n\n* **[NUCore](https://github.com/tablexi/nucore-open).** The \"Northwestern University Core Facility Management Software\", a mature, open source lab management software. Among other things, it allows to manage instruments, access to instruments, charging money for that access, services that can be purchased, and user permissions using their [user role system](https://github.com/tablexi/nucore-open/blob/master/doc/user_roles.md).\n\n* **[NEMO](https://github.com/usnistgov/NEMO).** A laboratory logistics management solution to book tool access, document tool usage, plan tool maintenance etc.. Developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology and very much in active development. It is created as a modular Django application that might serve nicely as a template for a modular commune management application.\n\n* **[Easy!Appointments](http://easyappointments.org/)**. Free and open source software, written in PHP, and coming with a WordPress plugin. Bit limited, geared towards booking appointments at a doctor etc. and not for multi-day reservations of accommodation. Nice simple step-by-step reservation process. Source code [here](https://github.com/alextselegidis/easyappointments), which is well-developed (>1200 commits) and still maintained.\n\n* **[PyRIGS](https://github.com/nottinghamtec/PyRIGS).** A mature but specialized booking system made for events. Python-based, >1600 commits.\n\n* **[Student Personnel Booking Manager](https://github.com/SPF-UiO/spbm).** \"This is the code for the Student basement pubs society current web-based system for roughly managing our various bookings and rentals of our collective premises, student employees, invoicing our member societies, as well as wage reporting to facilitate payroll.\" So, not generic, but could be useful.\n\n* **[Plan:Eat](https://github.com/digitaljosh/meal-planner).** Meal planning application with recipe integration, a FullCalendar based calendar and a generated shopping list. Written in Python, using Flask. Seems mature for its purpose and can serve as an example of using FullCalendar.\n\n* **[MAD Booking](https://github.com/jmccarth/mad-booking).** Ruby-based booking system. Users book events together with equipment.\n\n* **[Nuclibook](https://github.com/musalbas/Nuclibook).** Resource booking system for a nuclear medicine hospital. Written in Java and seemingly mature (1352 commits).\n\n* **[ABC Roster](http://www.abc-roster.com/).** A gratis (but not open source) desktop software application for employee shift scheduling.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-4\">1.4. Small applications</h3>\n\nThese are not full-featured applications but custom solutions for specific cases. They will have to be adapted / extended in order to use them for another use case, but can provide useful examples and scaffolding. Both applications for room booking, general resource booking and any other type of booking / scheduling are included.\n\n* **Django based applications.** All of the below are quite small and not yet mature, so there will be some work. But you can choose where to start from. Django was definitely the most popular Python framework for room / hotel booking software, and all of the solutions below are very compact. So Django might be quite a good choice for this.\n\n    * **[Seguinus](https://github.com/simonpessemesse/seguinus).** A \"hotel / restaurant booking and billing system. It is written in Python 3, using PyQt4, and Django.\" So at least a part uses a non-web GUI (Qt based). Could be a mature application (to be tested). There is some [documentation in French](https://seguinus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n    * **[django-booking](https://github.com/bitlabstudio/django-booking).** \"A reusable Django app that manages bookings for various purposes.\" 41 commits.\n\n    * **[R2E2](https://github.com/updcswebteam/r2e2).** A simple room booking system for a university, written in Python, realized as a plugin for the Django CMS. Seemingly no longer in active development. Some documentation is available [here](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/r2e2-docs/latest/r2e2-docs.pdf).\n\n    * **[django-resource-scheduler](https://github.com/simon-andrews/django-resource-scheduler).** \"Django app for scheduling the use of shared physical resources.\" 16 commits.\n\n    * **[booking-example](https://github.com/andreagrandi/booking-example).** \"A restaurant table booking example in Python/Django\". 24 commits.\n\n    * **[django-reservations](https://github.com/bernii/django-reservations).** \"Django module for handling reservations/booking\". Small but seems already useful, and at least can serve as a demo how to handle bookings in the Django framework.\n\n    * **[Online Booking System](https://github.com/martin041313/online_booking_system).** Django application for booking hotel rooms and tickets.\n\n    * **[hotelBooking](https://github.com/manab159/hotelBooking).** Another Django based, small hotel booking software.\n\n    * **[hotel-booking](https://github.com/AKBARMOHAMMAD/hotel-booking).** A Django based booking system for one specific hotel (with pictures of it in the source code \u2026).\n\n    * **[marakesh](https://github.com/bolshoibooze/marakesh).** Booking system for one specific hotel (again with pictures of it in the source code \u2026). Also allowing to book customized tours etc..\n\n    * **[monthy-python](https://github.com/wbeyda/monthy-python).** A Django based application to book contractors for work at customer locations. Includes a calendar. Not a generic and rather simple booking application.\n\n    * **[room-booking](https://github.com/scsper/room-booking).** A Django based application \"for churches to schedule and book rooms\". Not generic, and no longer in development. But may offer inspirations.\n\n    * **[django-impro-site](https://github.com/BikerJim/django-impro-site).** \"Django site that can handle userlogin, ticket reservations, course booking, and displaying of upcoming events\". Not really generic though, not matured, and no longer in development. But may offer inspirations.\n\n* **Flask based applications.**\n\n    * **[scheduler](https://github.com/ParkMinKyu/scheduler).** An example of using FullCalendar with Flask in Python. Seems the most developed of the examples found. Source code comments are in Chinese :-)\n\n    * **[flask-fullcalendar](https://github.com/kkarimi/flask-fullcalendar).** \"Example of using FullCalendar with Flask in Python\". Just a minimal example though.\n\n    * **[room-booking-app](https://github.com/chuangag/room-booking-app).** \"A simple room booking system build with Flask and SQLite\". Really small (12 commits), but at least a start.\n\n    * **[Hotel-registry](https://github.com/stikks/Hotel-registry).** A simple booking system for one hotel, written in Python and built with Flask. Screenshots are provided in the README.\n\n* **Other**\n\n    * **[cosum](https://cosum.de/).** A ([self-hostable](https://gitlab.com/dialogium/cosum)) German platform for lending e.g. every-day goods (vacuum cleaner) or to give away stuff for free (e.g. tomato plant seeds). Allows cooperations like freecycle shops and / or more private subgroups (your house and neighbours), but also publicly available items.\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-5\">1.5. Software components</h3>\n\nIn this list, you'll find software widgets, libraries and other components: anything related to resource scheduling / booking that is not even meant to be a stand-alone software application. But it might be a great tool to build one.\n\n* **[FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) with [Scheduler](https://fullcalendar.io/scheduler).** An open source, interactive JavaScript calendar component. It is used in quite a lot of calendaring / resource booking apps, including Booked Scheduler (from the list above). Source code is [here](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar) and [here](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar-scheduler), and note that the major rework \"version 4\" of both is just out (in an alpha release, as of 2018-12).\n\n    What's really great for the context here is the [Scheduler add-on](https://fullcalendar.io/scheduler), which allows to list bookings in a grid, separated by resource (room etc.). The grid columns can be minutes, hours or days (!), as demonstrated in the [custom scale demo](https://fullcalendar.io/releases/fullcalendar-scheduler/1.9.4/demos/scale.html).\n\n* **[dhtmlxScheduler](https://docs.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/).** A JavaScript widget that displays an interactive calendar. Adding a multi-day event is nicely possible with click&hold ([example](https://docs.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/samples/05_calendar/01_select.html)). This refers to their GPL licenced version (source code [here](https://github.com/DHTMLX/scheduler)); sadly, the [per-resource timeline view](https://docs.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/timeline_view.html) that would be most useful for a scheduler application is not part of the open source version.\n\n    The feature set and quality is quite similar to FullCalendar (which see), just that FullCalendar also includes the equivalent of the timeline view in its open source version, there called FullCalendar Scheduler.\n\n* **[booking-js](https://github.com/timekit-io/booking-js).** An open source JavaScript component that serves as the frontend for creating bookings for the commercial [Timekit.io](https://www.timekit.io/) API platform. However, it is of course technically possible to create an open source backend for this widget. Developer documentation is [here](https://developers.timekit.io/docs/booking-widget-v2). There is also a community-provided [integration with Stripe payments](https://github.com/Pheels/bookingjs-timekit-checkout).\n\n* **[react-booking-calendar](https://github.com/kristijanbambir/react-booking-calendar).** A JavaScript component to show an interactive calendar for booking resources, but a lot simpler than FullCalendar and dhtmlxScheduler above. Seems to also come with a backend for demo purposes.\n\n* **[Resource View](https://github.com/wgaggioli/Resource-View).** A JavaScript component providing a (simple) scheduler-type view for resources and events.\n\n* **[Cottage Booking](https://github.com/neontribe/cottage-booking).** JavaScript based frontend of an accommodation platform similar to booking.com (?). The REST-ful backend is not included, but perhaps not difficult to add.\n\n* **[libres](https://github.com/seantis/libres/tree/master/libres).** An open source Python library for reservation systems. [Used in Seantis Reservation](https://github.com/seantis/seantis.reservation/blob/c283bb2bd36fb0b2505f3aad49cc6f10be0d32f8/setup.py#L58) (see above), and basically its outsourced core ([see](https://pypi.org/project/seantis.reservation/#id3)).\n\n    So it could be a good way to build a Plone-independent reservation software in Python, although it seems to supply only the minimal backend classes so far. There is however [an example of using libres with Flask](https://github.com/seantis/libres/tree/master/examples/flask), the well-known Python micro-framework.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Finding more software</h2>\n\nHere are the most \"lucrative\" ways of searching that I came across:\n\n* search for [\"booking\" on GitHub](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=booking)\n* search for [\"fullcalendar\" on GitHub](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=fullcalendar)\n* search for \"booking\" on SourceForge\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Choosing the right software for a commune</h2>\n\nI have a big interest in small self-supply communes \u2013 see also other [Autarky Lab](/c/earthos/autarky) content for context. And for that and similar situations of co-living, flat sharing and intentional communities, resource scheduling and booking software can come in quite handy to reduce the friction and stress of day-to-day activities, and to be able to provide and use communal  infrastructure efficiently. Example uses include:\n\n* Managing one or more guest rooms (like we have now in Brussels at Edgeryders' headquarters \"The Reef\"). In contrast to now, potential guests do not have to inquire about availability by e-mail / chat / phone, but can see it online and send a booking request, or book right away. Automatic syncing with AirBnB and / or BeWelcome / Couchsurfing is technically possible, but could be a hazzle to implement.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;For rooms that are moderately (30-40%) utilized via AirBnB, allowing that same room to be booked in the resource scheduling software without money would not significantly diminish the rental income: AirBnB guests simply don't know about this option, and booking collisions are quite rare.\n\n* Having a communal car and scheduling who requires it when. Also, seeing who is going with the car where and when allows to join the ride, saving fuel and costs.\n\n* Managing other limited community resources like car workshop space, rare tools (CNC mill, 3D printer, welder) etc..\n\nOn the technical side, I propose the following requirements:\n\n* A software to manage a commune / co-living house should be extensible with other components later. For example, a Django based app seems to provide good scaffolding and a rich selection of open source modules. Rails engines can provide a similar thing.\n\n* The programming language should be modern enough to be around in 10 years (so, not PHP), and of course match with the in-house developer skills. Python, Ruby and JavaScript / Node.JS are good candidates.\n\nI'm not too sure which software from the list above I'd choose in the end. However, [FabManager](https://github.com/sleede/fab-manager) is my favourite right now because it integrates all major types of reservations (tools, spaces and events). Alternatively, [leihs](https://github.com/leihs/leihs) and [Reservations](https://github.com/YaleSTC/reservations) seem great as well because at first sight, it seems they can be easily adapted to manage both room and equipment reservations. They might however not cover reservations for parts of a day, which can be important in a commune for resources like cars, certain tools etc..\n\nAnother option is to choose one of the Django-based booking applications from above (probably [NEMO](https://github.com/usnistgov/NEMO)) and rework it to use [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) and [FullCalendar Scheduler](https://fullcalendar.io/scheduler). And then add whatever Django app the commune would need as well: shopping list, workshop inventory etc..\n\nAnd then there are are multiple solutions built on Flask. Which is a nice Python framework as well, but integrating multiple Flask applications with each other is not as simple as with Django (but would be a regular task if this becomes an all-in-one commune management application).", "created_at": "2017-08-03 14:18:55.677119", "updated_at": "2020-12-08 13:43:25.266611", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3989, "wiki": true, "reads": 62, "score": 330177.4, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791, 4861, 1543, 4795, 5040, 6782, 7050], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69348, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 12510, "post_number": 2, "raw": "It's looking good!

It looks like prices of different things as denominated in darknet credits are determined by market mechanisms, but it\u2019s hard to say. The darknet economy emerges in two steps: first, a complicated scheme enacted by a weak (but very effective) AI extracts money off large financial corporations, funding the transition to the new economy (a pretty bloody one, that entails eliminating some plutocrats and violently wiping out drug cartels). Second, the fledgling economy turns out to be very efficient, because it wastes much less energy in corporate bullshit and does not care about IPRs. The critique of the inefficiencies of late capitalism is sharp enough, but there is no real explanation for why the agents of the darknet economy do not become extractive and bullshitting like those of the mainstream economy.\"\n},\n{\n\t\"title\": \"Infomocracy\",\n\t\"author\": \"Malka Older\",\n\t\"image\": \"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZNJ4EifGL.jpg\",\n\t\"publisher\": \"Tor.com\",\n\t\"date\": \"2016\",\n\t\"description\": \"Read Infomocracy, the first book in Campbell Award finalist Malka Older's groundbreaking cyberpunk political thriller series The Centenal Cycle, a finalist for the Hugo Award for Best Series, and the novel NPR called \\\"Kinetic and gripping.\\\" \u2022 A Locus Award Finalist for Best First Novel \u2022 The book The Huffington Post called \\\"one of the greatest literary debuts in recent history\\\" \u2022 One of Kirkus' \\\"Best Fiction of 2016\\\" \u2022 One of The Washington Post's \\\"Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of 2016\\\" \u2022 One of Book Riot's \\\"Best Books of 2016 So Far\\\" It's been twenty years and two election cycles since Information, a powerful search engine monopoly, pioneered the switch from warring nation-states to global micro-democracy.

Reframing my own, if I miss something please jump in @manuelpueyo @Sabine @Malcolm :-)\n\nFirst thing that will happen (in order of priorities) will be the search for the building and starting negotiations. In parrallel to this, we aim to keep discovering people who could be good fits for such a project, who together have the right 'chemistry', as @johncoate would say, BUT we also need to be efficient at gauging real interest in the project.  To put it in other words, we'd need to zoom in on that part of say, a growing Reef community of enthusiasts, to a Reef community of inhabitants.\n\nThere's two scenarios in which *the Reef community of inhabitants* could form:\n1. (baseline) we, Edgeryders operational team, find a building and prepare the commercial offer, then roll it out and see who comes forward from all of Brussels/ Belgium.\n2. (the ideal option) a tight group of people forms who are making the decision to invest together, and shape the way the offer is presented to others who join. These newer people might be just as invested at the time of making the agreement, but could also be filling a roster of people for shorter stays. in the scenario in which you could have 12 out of 20 people committed, and would still need to find the money for the other remaining few spots.\n\nThe question raised by Sabine - **How do you build the co-living aspect into the commercial offer?**\n\nSome processes which could help us get closer to the Reef community of inhabitants and real relationships.\n\n* Membership in the Reef ASBL - this signals preliminary commitment and ensures peole are part of  the process, with some regularity of meetings and discussions, but is not binding anyone to become an inhabitant.\n* write a Manifesto and collect adherents to it. This Manifesto could be the door to the ASBL too.\n* v2.0. of the questionnaire we had for workshop participants, with more actionable details included. The questionnaire inquires about people's life situation, what facilities they need, if they are looking to invest money and how much time they could dedicate to the project i.e. house projects, but also volunteering to do community management or facilitation.\n* communication activities and content curation to really spread out the offer of the Reef. Some of these can be part of communication for the Expo of green living in 2020, because the Expo could be a nice window into what the Reef could be.

The digital allowed me to explore opportunities that would not have been available otherwise, and it made my life borderless when it came to the places I could work in, the organisational cultures to learn from, the people to have as colleagues and befriend. But I wonder how it is like for those who only now onboard this journey, especially when I myself haven't figured it out entirely? I'm curious what you are experiencing.\n\n**We are now looking at several trends likely to be accelerated by covid at the same time, but one change is already happening at scale: remote work.**\n\n![trends.PNG|690x200](upload://aVVlCG8lIso5ZXKkk49Cim2dIgR.jpeg) \n\nWe read about these trends and the many questions that they come with: How can we make AI and humans a joint, not an opposing force? Will we see increased digital accessibility if we will be able talk to each other in any language in real time? Will companies attract more and more global talent using the digital? But there is 1 change that stares us in the face: it is remote work.\n\nEmployees see flexible working as the new normal - that means, broadly choosing where and when you work from, to some extent. Below is data from a study by International Workplace Group, with more than 15,000 people across 80 nations. Caveat: they're people in the business sector, not too diverse unfortunately. But guess what? It\u2019s data from 2019, before covid19 hit!\n\n![Flexible working the New Normal|690x378](upload://8VLdDtOI68UrUirXHhSYuKi6fCR.png) \n\nThis year in April, about 4 in 10 employees in the EU started teleworking (37%) ([source](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/report/2020/living-working-and-covid-19-first-findings-april-2020)). In the US in June, half of the people were working online. In countries where more people began working from home as a result of the pandemic, fewer workers lost work. What\u2019s interesting about these major disruptions is that many people asked said that this is a lifestyle they can get used to. In the UK, only 6% would like to go back to life before Covid.\n\n# The benefits of working remotely are pretty obvious to some of us.\n\n* **Economic:** how much could we save by not owning or renting entire buildings? *'we estimate a typical employer can save an average of $11,000 per half-time telecommuter per year. The primary savings are the result of increased productivity, lower real estate costs, reduced absenteeism and turnover, and better disaster preparedness.'* ([source](https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics)). @joduinn makes a good case for distributed economic development with the help of worker's relocation in co-working spaces - [see his argument here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-teams-as-distributed-economic-development/14183). \n\n* **The positive impact on the environment** can be huge. The most telling number I've seen is 28%.  In California, cars going to work make for 28% of the State\u2019s GHG emissions ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-climatechange-california-insight/a-climate-problem-even-california-cant-fix-tailpipe-pollution-idUSKCN1PQ4MJ)). Imagine how our cities could begin to serve their people again and not just be pollution hubs.\n\n* **Social gains:** Here, we have yet to understand fully how it works, but many believe that remote working can create more inclusive workplaces: think about care givers or women with young children who would have more time for them. Also, some people in the [co-working sector](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/coworking-recovery/364) think we can bridge the rural-urban gap by setting up smaller offices in small towns or rural areas that are closer to one's home, and inherently more community oriented.\n\nI would argue that the choice to be made is not between: ''Yes, we will work remotely'' or ''No, we will keep our office''. For most of us, it will anyway be a mix of the two. No matter in which kind of company and work policy we are in, the question I see more important is: How we will work well..?\n\n# The devil in the details\n\nBuffer & AngelList, two digital companies, have been studying this for the past years and just released their year report on data collected from 3500 remote workers from across the world, many of them mid level and senior professionals. \n\n![Benefits and struggles in remote work|690x238](upload://j5gt6mG8oTzFsdk1pGxXFCK8L82.png) \nSource and report [here](https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020).\n\nThe best thing about remote work is clearly flexibility. What\u2019s more revealing is what is not working so well. People have difficulty working together, they feel lonely, or they cannot unplug, that is, disconnect from work. To the best we can, I think we need to get better at some key things in order to get the most out of online working not for the purpose of efficiency, but more to stay connected to the world around us:\n\n\n**1. ONLINE COLLABORATION**\n\nHow do we build the culture of being online together with our colleagues? It\u2019s not just about learning digital skills, but also about how to make ourselves understood by others, how to solve problems or manage conflicts. Or think about the social aspect: what is acceptable to do and what not? Is it OK to have my baby or my cat in front of my screen with me, or not?\n\nOne way to think about it is to ask ourselves: what can we replicate from the face to face? I have some examples here after watching @howard_rheingold's [recent talk with the Institute for the Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcEE6hugKss&feature=youtu.be), where he clearly stated that the online will not replace our face to face interactions, but we can try to emulate them:\n\n* Lectures & Trainings: The difference from real life is that your audience is captive, so you want to: have a facilitator, upload videos ahead, keep talks to max. 20 mins and leave the rest of the time for activities where people can participate.\n* Video meetings are now the standard tool for business communication, but many leaders make the mistake of overcompensating by scheduling too many of them. I don\u2019t know about you, but 5 meetings every day is exhausting..! Also, they should never last more than 1 hour, unless it\u2019s a strategic meeting.\n* Teams interaction: This is the equivalent of the 'ambient community' feeling to keep us happy \u2013 the people we chat to when we go get our morning coffee and all the people we recognise as we go about our daily lives (@amelia's [great remark here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/universities-and-students-in-coping-mode-challenges-of-elearning/13206/6)). The opportunity here is that they can be asynchronous. We can use platforms for online conversations: if not an entirely managed one, then at least a slack or wordpress comments section could work.\n* Desk mates: can we replicate desk mates? These could be virtual co-working days, like a library study where people work together not with much interaction, but their presence in the space together helps keep each other accountable.\n* Office small talk: in Edgeryders, we have a group for discussions called [Campfire](https://edgeryders.eu/c/campfire/237) - it\u2019s chatty, people are just checking in to say how they\u2019re doing and what are they up to in their daily life. \n\n.. and many other tricks can probably be found. We can be socially closer by being physically distant, but we need to ask ourselves: what is useful and how to begin to practice new things, instill new social norms in our community of co-workers?\n\n**2. MENTAL HEALTH**\n\nThis [Eurofound study of work and life during covid19](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/report/2020/living-working-and-covid-19) revealed that 1 out of 5 of all workers report working in their free time at least every other day; however, for those teleworking during pandemic, over 1 in 4 state that they work in their free time to meet the demands of work.\n\nSo what can we each do to do our work well AND stay healthy?\n\n* Autonomy <-> Self-Discipline. We have a lot more autonomy as online workers, yes, but if we are not disciplined about our 'office hours' and manage our focus and productivity, we will get lost in all the freedom. This is the most expensive lesson I believe. It's also the [number one worry](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/how-people-and-companies-feel-about-working-remotely/) of managers when it comes to letting their people loose.\n* Time management: if you're time tracking as an online worker, you will probably see that what you usually do in 8 or 10 hrs at the regular office, you can probably do in 6 hours online if you are focused (ex: pomodoro technique; batch email reading and many tips out there). @matthias explained this to me early on and I've been grateful ever since. It also helped me understand that often I don't need to be stuck to my screen for 8 hours full to get through the daily tasks and feel good about myself. \n* \u2018Unplugging\u2019: means disconnecting from work tasks. We all, entrepreneurs and employees, struggle with burnout constantly - one of the buzzwords for when someone is going to be unreachable and recharging their batteries is \u2018Digital detox\u2019. I highly recommend it, if you can do it every now and then, for at least 1 or 2 days in a row.\n\n**3. REGENERATION**\n\nFinally, let\u2019s take a minute to think about the idle time and space we can discover while we don't need to commute anymore and we learn to get better at how we work online: this new normal can free up energy and time, which is how many people found new passions these months. You know how they say people will come out of lockdown either as chefs or gardeners (or alcoholics, but I'm not counting that :-))? I can testify to that, as well as for many friends. The planet is doing it already, why shouldn't we do it too?\n\nIf I were to choose between the septic, socially distanced office of the future and some cosy alternative, guess what I'd choose..\n\n![Choose.PNG|690x307](upload://MeyrIHFwPMDYyHdD3rmWpzlBnC.jpeg) \n*On the left: the office of the future by Cushman & Wakefield*", "created_at": "2020-07-31 10:23:37.934654", "updated_at": "2020-09-24 22:40:04.464986", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1745, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 406.4, "like_count": 9, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 8, 3703, 5268, 6649, 6442, 5, 1520, 1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80774, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 14088, "post_number": 17, "raw": "[quote=\"Jan, post:16, topic:14088\"]\nI am going over the list of our questions one more time\n[/quote]\n\nYou are welcome to post them so I have them in visual form too.", "created_at": "2020-07-20 14:53:38.394610", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 14:53:38.394610", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [80772], "is_reply_to": [80772], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9055, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 495, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Interesting</b>\n\nThanks for the vote of confidence, @vassilis_giannakopou _-_ SciFY  .

It is part of Mezzogiorno, Italy's less affluent south, and as such plagued by long-term unemployment, persistent inequalities, and subpar infrastructure, despite robust cash transfers from the more affluent north. Sicily also has a more specific problem: the Mafia, whose networked criminal economy is a further drain on local resources. But in the late 90s, a group of friends mounted an attempt to regenerate the local economy. 20 years on, this attempt has blossomed into what they call an \"advanced social district\": 120 organizations, spanning from breweries to construction, from social cooperatives to research centers, from energy production to a contemporary art museum. Along the way, they have come up with a unique approach to economic and social development. So unique, in fact, that it looks almost alien. \n\n### Gaetano\n\nLa storia comincia nel 1998. Siamo in piena primavera siciliana. La Sicilia \u00e8 percorsa da un movimento popolare senza precedenti, di lotta non violenta alla mafia. Coalizioni progressiste usano questa spinta per arrivare al governo di quasi tutte le citt\u00e0 siciliane. Eppure, qualche anno pi\u00f9 tardi, questa esperiena \u00e8 in via di riassoribimento. \n\nPerch\u00e9? La nostra ipotesi: perch\u00e9 non si \u00e8 intervenuto sulla struttura economica. L'economia capitalista \u00e8, in qualche senso, simile all'economia criminale, almeno nel senso che l'ipotesi antropologica (individualismo, massimizzazione del self-interest individuale). Quindi c'era bisogno di un centro studi: ricerca-azione per sperimentare modelli diversi, con cui un'economia diversa potesse funzionare.\n\nLa logica di ECOSMED era passare dall'economia come equilibrio di egoismi all'economia come cluster locali. Ne nascono subito (2000) tre. Uno \u00e8 di ricerca: Fondazione Horcynus Orca, uno strumento di produzione culturale e scientifico. Il secondo \u00e8 cooperativo (Basaglia etc.). Il terzo \u00e8 finanziario: un fondo di garanzia nato per la lotta al'usura, ma poi riutilizzato anche per le startup. \n\n### Alberto\n\nThe protagonists of Messina's development story dreamed of a different, better economy, but they knew had to be viable in the *present* economy, or their dream would not survive.  So, they developed a set of strategies that would enable them to thrive in the present, while at the same time bringing about pieces of their intended future. These strategies are remarkably simple to grasp, and they should be possible to imitate. They are: \n\n* Focus on stocks, not flows\n* Build systems, not networks\n* Build your system like a Dyson sphere\n* Encode human relationships in physical goods\n\n\n### Gaetano \n\n*on stocks* Le nostre politiche sono volte soprattutto alla redistribuzione di ricchezza. Certo, ci sono sempre flussi, ma se sganci i flussi dagli stocks finisci nel welfare assistenziale, e spesso nell'autoritarismo e nella violenza  (echi di mafia qui). L'autonomia delle persone dipende dal loro accesso a stocks. \n\n*on systems* Il nostro \u00e8 un sistema di contaminazioni, di connessioni. Ci sono due modelli: la rete ha dei nodi che comunicano. Non \u00e8 sufficiente, perch\u00e9 le transizioni di fase necessitano di scambi di energia con l'ambiente esterno. Il sistema \u00e8 un modello in cui i nodi si trasformano a vicenda, vengono a compromessi gli uni con gli altri, orientano la loro azione strategica in funzione dell'azione strategica gli uni con gli altri. Per esempio, la banca di credito cooperativo francese ha montato un fondo per sostenere le primavere arabe. Per esempio, la riflessione italiana su cosa dovrebbero fare le fondazioni di comunit\u00e0 \u00e8 molto figlia di FDCM. Quando gli elementi di un insiemee si scambiano non solo informazione, ma dinamiche trasformative, quello \u00e8 un sistema. \n\n*on Dysons spheres* S\u00ec, ci sono molte economie interne. L'attuazione delle policies consolida anche i cluster, che a loro volta sostengono la FDCM e l'hanno fatta nascere. Questo per\u00f2 deve essere accompagnato dall'apertura dei sistemi, se no fai comitati d'affari. L'apertura fa la differenza! [...] Nessuna transizione di fase pu\u00f2 avvenire senza scambiare energia con l'esterno del sistema. Il distretto sociale avanzato ha una sequenza genetica aperta, in cui ci sono \"slots\" per attori sovralocali: il comitato scientifico della fondazione, la rete REVES, etc. \n\nL'architettura \u00e8 autosimile. Scendi di scala e trovi sempre sistemi complessi. \n\n\n### Alberto \n\nI particularly like the idea of relational goods \u2013 physical goods that encode human relationships. Here is an example: the district includes a museum of contemporary art of the Mediterranean. Its collection was not put together with market purchases. Every single piece was either donated or produced locally in the context of art residencies. Every piece encodes a relationship, an alliance, a gesture of support, between the museum and the artists. The collection is now worth tens of millions, but of course the museum can not sell it without vaporizing the relational capital it symbolizes. But neither is it worthless, because these relationships are the basis for new revenue-generating projects. Also, the collection itself is a tourist attractor and a generator of new relationships. The economic value of this collection is not realized by cashing out on it, but by stewarding it and growing it. \n\nBuilding a new economy while being viable in old one is hard. In Messina, however, the advanced social district has some help: a community foundation, Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 Messina. It was established in 2010 by organizations in the district itself. \n\n### Gaetano \n\nFDCM \u00e8 una fondazione anomale. \u00c8 una fondazione erogativa che NON FA BANDI, e non finanzia microprogetti. Il modello di grant su progetti, noi pensiamo, \u00e8 figlio della logica della precarizzazione dell'economia e del lavoro. Quello che FDCM fa \u00e8 finanziare policies, fra di loro fortemente intercorrelate, e utilizza i suoi clusters per gestirle. Le politiche di ricerca e innovazione le fa Horcynus Orca. Quelle economiche e sociali le fa ECOSMED. Quelle sulle categorie deboli le fa il centro Puglisi, etc. Questo ci d\u00e0 un impatto molto pi\u00f9 grande e molto pi\u00f9 duraturo nel tempo.", "created_at": "2020-05-21 10:42:41.868949", "updated_at": "2020-05-21 10:42:58.379255", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 988, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 68.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5393, 4892, 6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5730, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5697, "post_number": 1, "raw": "As part of OpenCare, we will use OE.

In this post, I refer to both Blivande and Edgeryders as \"us\" and \"we\" which might be confusing unless you know that I am a director of both entities.\n\n## Growing a sustainable ecosystem\n\n![IMG_2992|690x517](upload://z411txOFmlx0dYBMfJUbWZPtO2T.jpeg) \n\nBlivande was dreamt up about 18 months ago. In November last year, we got the keys to a beautiful 1000 square meter house in the harbor. Our rent is lower than market rates for the area, but far from cheap, at roughly 10,000 EUR. Including utilities, insurance, and maintenance costs, our expenses are around 12,500 EUR per month.\n\nBlivande was never a very straight forward proposal, and it has taken some time for us and our community to start understanding our model. Increasingly over the last few months, I have started referring to Blivande as an ecosystem, made up of many overlapping circles. **Blivande** is the name of the ecosystem as a whole, and also the name of the house, as well as the not-for-profit company that runs it. This post is an attempt at mapping out this growing ecosystem.\n\n### Studio Tau\n\n![21_09_2019_%20Blivande%20at%20Frihamnen%20Live%20(8)|690x388](upload://mfbjcV9JTAEKfP88UMLfbNlyCDH.jpeg) \n\n**Studio Tau** is our workshop for artists and makers. We chose to call it an art space rather than a maker space because that's what we wanted to create room for and attract. This focus comes from a need within the community which creates participatory art events like [The Borderland](http://theborderland.se/). We had noticed that it was hard for the creative and open-ended processes of artists to fit in engineer-type maker spaces. We also wanted makers, but we made a bet on that there were plenty of makers and doers in our community that would love to be in a creative space with artists. This seems to have been a good bet. We have 17 members of Tau, including our very own @MariaEuler, @jonasjohansson and [Simon](https://www.instagram.com/simoncederquist/) who are perfect examples of artists overlapping with the maker ethos, and members like metalwork specialist @elch who also works on community art projects, plumber Theodor who is building a tiny house art-sauna and recent members Albin and Louisa and [their van Wanda](https://www.instagram.com/wandathevan/). Last but not least, [a temple structure](https://sn.dk/Taastrup/Se-billederne-Stort-naturomraade-har-faaet-et-tempel/artikel/859888) made out of 1,000 meters of wooden beams has been designed and prefabricated at Tau by our magnificent futuristic robot architect @annielocke and team. It now stands in Denmark as a permanent installation. I'm proud to also have been a part of that project. \n\nTau is supposed to be largely run by its members, who are also supposed to eventually make the decisions on what investments to make. This already works like a charm for certain parts of the space. @jonasjohansson has built an electronics lab, and I have simply set up company accounts with several suppliers and given him the right to go shopping on our behalf without having to ask me for permission unless it's a major investment. We then get invoices from the suppliers. We've tried to buy as much as possible by invoice and set up accounts all across town to minimize the paperwork. \n\nOur initial model for Tau was to only have flexible memberships (at 80 EUR per month) where people would have boxes that they packed their stuff into when they went home for the day. Our exception was two artists in residence (Simon and @MariaEuler) who would get private rooms. Eligibility for the artist in residence program is based largely on a gut feeling that someone would contribute to Blivande and its culture. We look for artists who love collaborating and who are not afraid to experiment with their process to co-create with others. After some trial and error, we've seen how much better it is to give more talented artists access to permanent space. Many professional artists need to have their process uninterrupted for long periods, and packing up at the end of the day just isn't viable. People with fixed desks also spend more time in the house. We are now moving towards creating up to 8 permanent desks in Tau for 250 EUR per month, essentially extending our artist in residence program. To be eligible, you should be a good fit for the culture and an artist or maker who will use the space for its intended purpose \u2013 as opposed to for example a programmer who does some occasional soldering on the side.\n\nWe could start Tau because of a 100,000 EUR grant from Kulturbryggan, which we are using to invest in tools and custom containers at Frihamnstorget, which I'll get to in a moment. We are also able to use some of this cash as a buffer to cover our rent while we build up our income streams. Over the first three years, I estimate that we will spend around 70,000 EUR on tools, machines, and containers for Tau.\n\n### Studio Beta\n\n![21_09_2019_%20Blivande%20at%20Frihamnen%20Live%20(4)|690x388](upload://h4cBjn2fM8DVbkppNHN9kgMVo5S.jpeg) \n\n**Studio Beta** is our upstairs co-working space. While Tau is a very co-created space, Beta requires more effort from the team. @hampus, @Linnea, and AlexanderZ restock the kitchen, make sure there is coffee, clean regularly and are on call if something goes wrong. We want Beta to be an environment where you can have as much order and stillness as you need in a house that is otherwise very dynamic. We currently have 12 members at Beta, which is about 1/3 of maximum capacity. All members of Beta also have full access to Tau.\n\nRunning Beta has been relatively smooth once we got going, but because of our divided focus on making the entire ecosystem work, we have not been as strong on promoting the space as we should be. Outreach for Beta is a priority for the rest of 2019 and 2020. We are looking to grow Beta at a steady pace over the next nine months, aiming for 25 members by June 2020.\n\n### Blivande Events\n\n![90ea4431-a797-4eb0-95ad-f4958bc8bd52|690x517](upload://ivZck93lIBtAXZhQ5CrzyWTxCaq.jpeg) \n\n![IMG_0419|690x517](upload://WhQLDEASg0EozBHI0tUicYnAKx.jpeg) \n\nAn important function of Blivande is as a hub for events. We've been growing in popularity as a party venue, and in November we are more or less booked full with every weekend. In addition to the parties, we also have occasional daytime seminars and meetings. We are expecting income from events to be at least 3500 EUR per month on average in 2020, with the potential to be much higher if we start actively promoting the space \u2013 currently, it's all through word of mouth and our networks. This income stream is particularly important since it will go straight towards salaries for people working in the house once memberships of Beta and Tau reach around 25 in each category. Our goal is for the events to eventually support one full-time salary for a person in the community. Currently, events are run by Hampus and Linnea with a growing team of community members.\n\n### The Node \n\n![IMG_0423|690x517](upload://8lM2UnOZl8NY1v6fYb6Em0593BQ.jpeg) \n\n![21_09_2019_%20Blivande%20at%20Frihamnen%20Live%20(3)|690x388](upload://6GzPqAcqGNCSXB2GsPoPFVE8ndU.jpeg) \n\n**The Node** is the oldest part of the ecosystem and a separate organization. We started the Node in 2015 and a year later we started the non-profit association. It's hard to understand Blivande without understanding the Node, as it is the continuation of that story, so for a full picture you can [read the introduction](https://www.noden.community/) to the Node. We currently have 300 active members, paying 100 SEK per month, and between 4 to 7 events every week, free of charge for all members. Without the Node, Blivande could not exist. Without Blivande, the Node would be much smaller and unprotected from the forces of the market. Through this symbiosis, Blivande wraps a protective shell around the Node, and the Node becomes the beating heart of Blivande.\n\nThe Node has 400 m2 of the house, every night from 18:00 until late from Monday to Thursday, and every other Saturday and every Sunday. These are the hours when the Node has traditionally run its activities at the old location before moving to Blivande, so it is not particularly limiting. The layout of that space is planned with both the Node and Blivande events in mind, and one of the large rooms is the Node \"home-room\" where they have most of the creative control. The Node pays around 3,300 EUR per month in rent to Blivande, which includes utilities, cleaning supplies and house maintenance.\n\n### Frihamnstorget\n\n![21_09_2019_%20Blivande%20at%20Frihamnen%20Live%20(5)|690x388](upload://oPme7koPv2WnAUAuqnH16f5nwke.jpeg) \n\n![8c21c499-61b6-492b-9953-b87790b3f24d|690x517](upload://rjz4C1aVRrIipo6TRkXhe82CLzI.jpeg) \n\n![IMG_0448|690x517](upload://s8Bi0qEfUiWSnUNmrqezx1F2oxk.jpeg) \n\nWe always wanted to build a container structure outside of Blivande. Because of the 100th anniversary of the harbor, we got our chance and went for it. We built a colorful container village full of art and activities as a backdrop for their celebrations, which now gets to stay for at least one year, and hopefully longer. We managed to build Frihamnstorget in a few weeks, pitch a dome, decorate the space for the 100th anniversary and manage the event for less than 10,000 EUR.\n\nOur colorful container village allows us to:\n\n* Build exhibition rooms for the art created at Blivande, as well as provide space for outside artists to exhibit their works in containers, on top of them, and in the square.\n* Create space for a caf\u00e9 and restaurant, especially to create an attractive public place for the summer months when the demand for indoor event spaces dips in Stockholm.\n* Experiment with free public space and invite citizen initiatives to try ideas that would be difficult to get approval for in a public park or square. \n* Create room in containers for more heavy machinery that we can't or don't want to have indoors. For example, a laser cutter which needs ventilation, a noise CNC mill or welding which is a fire hazard indoors.\n* Give space to a lightweight industry zone outside the house needed by some of our members, like welder @elch and plumber Theodor. \n\n@jakobskote designed the square and has project managed it up to now. In the future, he will focus on managing the containers in the tower, which will be a curated exhibition space and a roof terrace garden. We will now find different people to manage other parts of the square, which we envision being a highly collaborative project.\n\nDuring the spring and summer next year, we expect to get some income from the square by having occasional company events, concerts, and parties. \n\n### Organizations \n\n**Edgeryders** is the first organization after the Node that has started developing a symbiosis with Blivande, much because I want to combine these two worlds. This year, the three Edgeryders seats at Blivande have been used interchangeably by me, @MariaEuler (working on NGI Forward), @jakobskote (working on Participio and new Babel Between Us project), @brooks working on Participio, @mattiasx working on the first NGI Forward meetup and this month by @amelia in the Research Network and @BlackForestBoi who is also involved in NGI Forward. We also ran an Edgeryders NGI Forward event earlier this year, which introduced @zelf and others to Edgeryders. \n\n![IMG_0412|690x517](upload://iIccaYJomEOK8V8o4SVolF4dLD6.jpeg) \n\nIn the coming year, I am starting a new company which will be the *de facto* Edgeryders Nordic legal entity. This company will be partially owned by Blivande and the first step towards the next stage of Blivande as an ecosystem of companies. With the Edgeryders Nordic company, I will apply for Swedish innovation funding to develop SenseStack, the Edgeryders stack of collective intelligence tools. Edgeryderd Nordic also runs the art and ethnography project Babel Between Us. I also have one potential consulting project in the pipeline, as well as a research project that is more on the idea stage. Our model when doing consulting will be to employ ethnographers and do SSNA through the Edgeryders mothership company Research Network. \n\n## Team\n\n@hampus, @Linnea, and I are the current team running Blivande. Hampus holds the artistic vision that shapes the look and feel of the house, together with Linnea. The two of them also do most of the day to day maintenance around the house, together with our intern Alexander. Hampus is also a jack-of-all-practical-trades and can drive a forklift and generally has a knack for learning practical skills. Linnea does a lot of the extremely important work of keeping the community together and strengthening internal relationships. I'm responsible for the economy, including everything from paying the bills to keeping our three-year economic forecast spreadsheet up to date. I also do most of the long term strategy work and create and document the structures and run the IT. I also represent us at many public speaking opportunities. We all do our share for outreach and member recruitment.\n\nFor the last nine months, the three of us have been pulling most of the load. This is to be expected in the first year, but as we hit our stride the weight needs to be more distributed. Luckily, there are some stellar people in the community who are stepping in to run and develop Blivande with us. Large project like Frihamnstorget that require a lot of teamwork are great to get people involved and provide space for people to claim their own projects that they can feel ownership over.\n\n## Financial outlook\n\nIf we manage to keep the pace of member recruitment, we should be fine. It's still a bit shaky, as it's our first year in business, and the Edgeryders investment has certainly helped a lot! Having a space for Edgeryders in Stockholm has also really helped in raising awareness here and getting people interested in what we do.\n\n## Blue sky imagined future: \n\n**A future ecosystem of companies** is what I think could be the goal for Blivande in a few years. One thing is certain: Blivande will be a not-for-profit company once we restructure next year, cementing it as a company with the purpose to serve its community. This following part is only my opinion, and it's a direction we have plenty of time to think long and hard about:\n\nIf we reach 30 members for Tau and Beta respectively, we will start generating a surplus of about 30,000 to 60,000 EUR per year starting 2021. This could be invested in projects and ideas by people in the community who would like to launch their own companies, which Blivande would then become a shareholder in. We would only do this for companies who are planning to use the house as their home base and contribute to the community. This way, we are investing in making the ecosystem stronger and creating opportunity within the community. Eventually, if some of these companies become profitable enough to generate returns, Blivande could use the return to invest in real estate that we own. But even if none of them ever become very profitable, we are strengthening the community and creating companies that use (and pay for memberships at) Beta and Tau. \n\nThis also creates an opportunity for Blivande to benefit from more risky spectacular endeavors, by owning shares in companies that might take investment or loans. This might be useful if the community, for example, would like to buy real estate or start some solar punk sustainable tech company. Blivande as a community can participate in the adventure, community members get some seed funding and incubation, and the owners of the new endeavor can feel safe in that while they are letting go of some shares, all returns from those shares will be used to benefit the community.\n\n**Housing at Frihamnstorget** is something I hope will happen eventually. Building modular container apartments for short term living could be possible. Short term, because the land isn't even zoned for residential use yet, which prohibits us from setting up anything long term. This venture should not be undertaken by Blivande as it would add a lot of responsibility, but we could be a participant in the venture in various ways.\n\n**Experiments in urban gardening and sustainability** would be fantastic. @jakobskote is already running one such experiment by building a miniature Swedish pine forest in the top container of the tower. The harbor is exceptionally windy, which might make small wind turbines on the containers possible. I'm more skeptical of solar because of the long dark winters, but it might work. Stockholm is already an exceptionally green city, so the need for urban greening is not as large as elsewhere, although the contrast of old containers and evergreen pine trees against the industrial harbor backdrop would be lovely.\n\n## Get in touch\n\nIf you end up reading this and want to get touch with Blivande, [we have a forum](https://forum.blivande.com/) hosted by Edgeryders Communities.

Some content relevant only to that community has been removed, other clarification have been added. This post is the current reference for the Realities project since it was brought into Particip.io._\n\n## I. What is Realities?\n\nWe're building a tool for decentralised organizations to track keep track of their structure while helping them make decisions. This particular tool uses the Advice Process and TEAL organisations as it's point of departure. In such organisations, work is not organised in a top down way. Instead, everyone in the organisation is allowed to make decisions as long as they seek advice from key stakeholders. Identifying those stakeholders and making sure you've sought their advice can be cumbersome and difficult, especially without deep knowledge about an organisation. Realities is a tool which aims to meet that challenge.\n\nWe don't want top-down leadership, but we recognize that an organization can't be leaderless. We want to build a tool that makes it as easy as possible for community leaders to find and claim their place, and in doing so, change the very structure of the organization. We also want to make sure that if they leave, the structure doesn't collapse in their absence.\n\n## II. Mission statement\n\nWe will develop a software system that helps people in a decentralised organisation plan and execute projects without traditional top-down management. As to not make the use case too abstract, we will use the organisation The Borderland and its participants as our user group and develop explicitly for them, while not adding features that are only relevant to that organisation. Realities should give users the ability to create Needs and then Responsibilities and to assign a Guide and a Realiser to each Need and Responsibility. Needs and Responsibilities are connected by Dependencies which clarify how they are connected. Creating and assigning Needs and Responsibilities and connecting them with Dependencies should be simple and intuitive. The UI of the software should also transparently indicate the correlations of these elements to each other for a faster overview of the larger scope, for example by drawing graphs and connecting them to each other.\n\n## III. Introduction to strange and unusual words\n\nReading the following list of terms will give you an idea of how the parts of this project fit together. This glossary is not definitive, and it is specific to the Realities project. It is just a way for us, who\u2019re working on the project, to sync our shared vocabulary.\n\n**The Borderland:** The Borderland is a participatory event, a collaborative community where we co-create events and gatherings as prototypes for our dreams. It is an empty container, open to your initiative. It is an invitation to play, to reflect, and to engage. The event is for co-creators only, and not open to spectators. \u201cThe Borderland\u201d refers to the borderland between dreams and reality. We use the Borderland as an example organisation when developing Realities.\n\n**Borderling:** A participant of the Borderland is a Borderling.\n\n**Dream:** A Dream is something that one or many Borderlings want to bring to the Borderland. Dreams can include but are not limited to art projects, events, workshops, spaces, or any of their combinations which can go as far as the imagination of the dreamer takes it.\n\n**Dreams Platform:** A web based system for prototyping, planning and funding Dreams for the Borderland. First developed by Borderlings, but now developed and maintained by an international community of Burners.\nDreamer: A Borderling who brings or wants to bring a Dream to the Borderland.\n\n**Dream Guide:** A Borderling who helps Dreamers get their Dreams ready for funding on the Dreams Platform by helping them follow guidelines. Guides can enable the process of receiving the grants for Dreams on the Dreams Platform. Some Dream Guides are also admins on the Dreams Platform.\n\n**Dream Admin:** An administrator on the Dreams Platform. Dream Admins can edit and remove Dreams on the Dreams Platform, manage users and add or remove grants.\n\n**Reality:** Something that must happen or exist at the Borderland so that the Dreams can be brought to the event.\n\n**Realities Platform:** A planned web-based system which helps Borderlings define what Realities must be realised, who is releasing them, and how these Realities connect to each other.\n\n**Need:** A concrete and defined condition that needs to be true for Borderlings to create their Dreams.\n\n**Responsibility:** A role or task that a Borderling can assign herself which partially or completely fulfils a Need.\n\n**Dependency:** A directed relation between a Need and Responsibility, between two Needs or between two Responsibilities. When a Borderling wants to make a decision that will affect a Responsibility, she can look at Dependencies to see who could be affected by this decision.\n\n**Realiser:** A Borderling who is assigned either to coordinate many Responsibilities needed to completely fulfill a Need, or to carry out a Responsibility.\n\n**Reality Guide:** A Borderling who is assigned to make sure that a specific Need or Responsibility has an active and competent Realiser. This may include defining requirements and headhunting for a fitting Borderling. Reality Guides will be a collaborating group of people that coordinate their efforts and support each other in this work.\n\n**Reality Admin:** An administrator on the Realities Platform who can edit and delete Needs, Responsibilities and Dependencies as well as remove Borderlings from roles as Reality Guide or Realiser. Most Reality Guides should also be Reality Admins. \n\n## IV. Why are we doing this again?\n\nThe project we are now getting ourselves into is creating a frame for the organisational aspects of the Borderland. We sometimes say that we organise the Borderland through \u201cConsent-based Do-ocracy\u201d. That means that the power to decide on activities rests with those who are going to execute them. In order to do this skilfully and without stepping on other's toes, the do-ocrat needs to gather perspectives of those affected by her decision, seek their advice, and take principled objections into consideration. By doing this, she becomes the best qualified in the community to take on (or take over) a responsibility, in part by gaining the knowledge and competence necessary, and in part simply because the act of connecting with those who are dependent upon them places them in the right position in the social network to act and influence what they need to. Thus, the Borderland is managed not through commands and control of a central authority, but rather by a network of contextual hierarchies based on the principle that power should flow to those who need it to take leadership. Realities are meant to facilitate this process. Along with the Reality Guides, the Realities Page is a module in a system where the Needs of the community can be processed into Responsibilities, supporting them to navigate the steps to flesh out their roles, ending in a clear set of accountabilities that they may execute. And also to provide structure and transparency so that these responsibilities may be handed over from those who find themselves unable to fulfil them to those who want to help, with minimal bureaucracy and confusion.\n\n### Realities is both a software platform and a process\nOur current aim is to create a first iteration of a system based on the principles of organization that the Borderland has arrived at through vision and experience. Again, it\u2019s important to  note that this system isn\u2019t just the Realities Platform and its users, but the platform, its users and its custodians and facilitators. Note the word facilitator - their role is to support and make things easier, not to manage. These Reality Guides may be viewed as the principal customers of the first version of the Realities Platform. Because of the artistic and individualistically expressive nature of our community, we are not expecting all our users to adopt a new platform and be able to use it from the beginning. Indeed, we don\u2019t want to impose a system that they have to adapt to fit into, but rather a system that is able to adapt to their needs as much as possible. This is why the platform can best be thought of as a tool to be delivered to the Reality Guides to assist them in handling the back-end complexity of a network-based organization structure. Its purpose is to to map who has assigned themselves which tasks as well as who their dependents are (the ones they need to be in connection with to execute). Later, this tool can evolve once real-world experience and data has accumulated and lessons have been learned.\n\n### Why create something new?\nNothing quite like what we need exists. What we're trying to do is not to create another task management tool. What we're doing is creating a dynamically created organizational chart, creating needs and responsibilities in a rhizome. It might look like task management tool, just like a burn just looks like a party in a quarry until you go there. \n\nAlso, we are a community of artists, and create is what we do. We should view our code as art. Art is something that happens in service of creating a human connection. It is also something that happens at the boundaries. What \u2018boundaries\u2019 exactly means is intentionally left vague. But in the context of Realities, what it refers to is the ability to be an author to one's own responsibilities without coercion so that the possibility is opened to execute as a work of artful self-expression.\n\n## V. Guidelines for development of the Realities Platform\n\n* It all starts from a Need: There must always be a Need initialised for other elements to relate to it (Responsibility, Reality Guide, Realiser etc).\n\n* A Need cannot be created without a Reality Guide assigned to it, and the person creating the Need automatically becomes the first Reality Guide for that Need.\n\n\n* A Need element has: A Reality Guide, a Realiser, a title, a description, a link to where discussion of the Need happens (Loomio or other platform), a list of Dependencies.\n\n\n* A Responsibility element has: A Need (required), a Reality Guide (automatically becomes the user creating the Responsibility, but can be reassigned), a Realiser, a title, a description, a link to where discussion of the Responsibility happens (Loomio or other platform), a list of Dependencies.\n\n\n* Every Need and Responsibility can also connect to other Needs and Responsibilities through Dependencies. A Dependency is directed so that one element is Dependent On another element. Dependencies are added to Needs or Responsibilities by selecting from all existing elements. Dependencies are tools to understand how elements fit together, but do not block any functionality.\n\n\n* Each Need and Responsibility can only have one Reality Guide and one Realiser. This principle is in place so bystander effect is minimized. We want for individuals to be empowered and be held accountable when holding a responsibility and have it as clear as possible who to contact when inquiring about some aspect of organization.\n\n\n* The end-user experience should be made as simple as possible. Essentially their experience can be contained by answering these questions for them, \u201cHow can I help?\u201d, \u201cWhat am I supposed to do next?\u201d and \u201cWho do I need to talk to?\u201d\n\n\n* The correlation between elements should be made visually explicit in a manner via which participants can easily grasp the big and small picture.\n\n## VI. User stories: Who, how and when?\n\nOur first priority is to use the Realities Platform for planning the Borderland in the months running up to the event. Our second priority is that the Realities Platform is suitable to use while at the event to answer questions about Responsibilities and who to contact.\n\nAll Borderlings are welcome on the platform from day one, but the most likely first users of the Realities Platform will be the Reality Guides. They arrive at an empty canvas, and it\u2019s their responsibility to define the first Needs and Responsibilities. Most of them will also be administrators on the platform, and able to modify all elements. We want to make it easy for them to develop system thinking and update Needs and Responsibilities with additional information and Dependencies as needed.\n\nWhen the platform has been populated with content, describing the current needs and responsibilities of the Borderland in rough terms, the Reality Guides will invite Borderlings to add their own content as well as fill roles as Realisers. Essentially their experience can be contained by answering these questions for them, \u201cHow can I help?\u201d, \u201cWhat am I supposed to do next?\u201d and \u201cWho do I need to talk to?\u201d.\n\nBorderlings who are creating Dreams or have questions or concerns can then filter through these Needs and Responsibilities to find answers.\n\nEventually, these Needs, Responsibilities and Dependencies will form a network of interconnected elements that could be represented as a graph. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/087602a2c957ff3557f31fcca2cd68fef778dbba.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"593\">\n\nThis is helpful to us when a Borderling wants to make a decision regarding a certain responsibility. By looking at the connections in the graph, it becomes easy to map out dependencies to other responsibilities in many steps. This is vital information in a self organised community, because these connections tell a story about who the Borderling needs to seek advice from before making that change. This information could either be represented in a visual graph in a different view, or in lists generated by predefined queries. This is not a use case for the first version, but the system should be designed and built to allow for this in the future.\n\n### User Roles and Authorisation\n\nAnyone can view all information on the Realities Platform without an account. Anyone can create an account on the Realities Platform to become a User, giving them rights to create Needs and Responsibilities connected to those needs. A User automatically becomes both Reality Guide and Realiser for any Need they create. A User automatically becomes Reality Guide for any Responsibility they create. If a User is either Reality Guide or Realiser for a Need or Responsibility, they have full write access to that Need or Responsibility. \n\nA User who is Reality Guide for a Need or Responsibility can delete that Need or Responsibility, but a Need can only be deleted if no responsibilities are connected to it. If a Need has connected responsibilities, those must be deleted first.\n\nIf a User is Reality Guide for a Need or Responsibility, they can assign another User as that Need or Responsibility\u2019s Reality Guide or Realiser, pending that User\u2019s approval in the system. If a User is Realiser for a Need or Responsibility, they can only assign another User as that Need or Responsibility\u2019s Realiser, pending that User\u2019s approval in the system.\n\nMost Reality Guides will also be Reality Admins. Reality Admins have write access across the entire Realities Platform. A Reality Admin can change a User\u2019s role to make them a Reality Admin. A Reality Admin can assign a User as the Reality Guide or Realiser for a Need or Responsibility instantly (without approval from that User in the system).\n\n### An incomplete list of user stories for development\n\n* As a User, want to create a new Need.\n* As a User, want to create a new Responsibility for a Need. \n* As a Reality Guide for a Need, I want to invite a User to take over as Reality Guide for that Need.\n* As a Reality Guide for a Responsibility, I want to invite a User to take over as Reality Guide for that Responsibility.\n* As a Reality Guide for a Need, I want to invite a User to become Realiser for that Need.\n* As a Reality Guide for a Responsibility, I want to invite a User to become Realiser for that Responsibility.\n* As a Reality Guide for a Need without connected Responsibilities, I want to delete that Need.\n* As a Reality Guide for a Responsibility, I want to delete that Responsibility.\n* As a Realiser for a Need, I want to invite a User to take over as Realiser for that Need.\n* As a Realiser for a Responsibility, I want to invite a User to take over as Realiser for that Responsibility.\n* As a Reality Guide or Realiser for a Need, I want to edit that Need\u2019s title. \n* As a Reality Guide or Realiser for a Need, I want to edit that Need\u2019s description.\n* As a Reality Guide or Realiser for a Need, I want to edit that Need\u2019s discussion link.\n* As a Reality Guide or Realiser for a Need, I want to assign a dependency to another Need. \n* As a Reality Guide or Realiser for a Need, I want to assign a dependency to another Responsibility. \n* As a Reality Guide or Realiser for a Need, I want to delete a dependency. \n* As a Reality Guide or Realiser for a Responsibility, I want to edit that Responsibility\u2019s title. \n* As a Reality Guide or Realiser for a Responsibility, I want to edit that Responsibility\u2019s description.\n* As a Reality Guide or Realiser for a Responsibility, I want to edit that Responsibility\u2019s discussion link.\n* As a Reality Guide or Realiser for a Responsibility, I want to assign a dependency to a Need. \n* As a Reality Guide or Realiser for a Responsibility, I want to assign a dependency to another Responsibility. \n* As a Reality Guide or Realiser for a Responsibility, I want to delete a dependency. \n* As a Reality Guide for a Responsibility, I _might_ want to reassign its Fullfills property to a different Need.\n\n## VII. Future scope of the Realities Platform\n\nThe system should be scoped so that future versions can allow for tools to make collaboration more efficient and powerful.

Since the plasticity of machine intelligence is on the horizon, researchers like Catherine Malabou or N. Katherine Hayles already suggest that to engage such hybrid forms of collectivity we make intelligence an object of (philosophical) inquiry again.

At the moment doing the job as a freelancers. 'From CIN we evolved into Brussel Avenir (transl. Brussels Future) - an organisation developing a participatory way to construct new narratives for the future of Brussels. We also experiment a lot with crowdsourcing narratives. It's how i learned about the project. I find your future narrative and how you present the vision very attractive.\n\nWe each share where we are with our stories:\n\nRichard: just posted [my story: How do you say Aaaaaaagh in German,](https://edgeryders.eu/t/wie-sagt-man-aaaaaaaaaaagh-auf-deutsch/9891/7) about health care provision to migrants from the time he was in Berlin. Got me thinking to people in worse situation than myself.\n\nEllen: What I've been intrigued by in the last years is tribes of youngsters who dont go in their own classrooms at the moment, they have their own online communities, facebook but also gaming chats and others. They're sort of growing up and forming their identity - it leaves a big role for them. They're experimenting a lot with their physical and their mental health, quite extreme: before, it used to be that the weird ones were the ones from rural areas or what not. Nowadays, everyone is experimenting.\n\nSome examples:\n* **[the Blue Whale Challenge](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-46505722)** started 2 years ago; facebook group where many young people joined, the comm leaders starting challenging them, for example to wake up in the middle of the night.. challenges became bigger and bigger, and addictive. To the point where they would ask you to scratch a whale in your arm and commit suicide.\n\n* **in Slovakia, Catholic communities are very popular and cool among young people** - catholic rock concerts, the way they use their social media, same as spirituality and belonging played a big role in that. Same as we had many people leaving for the Caliphate.\n\nJiri: they're young people, but not much younger than us. Thanks maybe to the online space as a matter of acquiring this sort of information. Gaming community - you dont know the age of people there.. those dynamics are very specific.\n\nEllen: On one hand, it's fascinating, but also scary that **these platforms are diversifying and the way the interaction is happening is hyper diverse.** As a youth researcher, it becomes more difficult every year to find access to those platforms. We had **[Schild en Vrienden](https://www.diggitmagazine.com/column/model-behind-schild-en-vrienden) in Ghent - this group of youngters not visible, and shocking everybody.** Or you have girls and boys with anorexia and exchanging ids to starve themselves. Not only for research purposes important, but for ways of reaching out to them.\n\nAt Brussel Avenir, we want to bring the concept of futures to citizens. We live in such a diverse city that we need hundreds of different strategies to reach all those communities. The world becomes super complex to study.\n\nNoemi: How would you see those narratives being told?\nWe are in the process of developing this tool - a persona / profiles of the populations in Brussels, and we have them around the table all the time. If we think about how we get them engaged, how we involve this person sitting on the table with us (metaphorically). Making stories that speak to the people. \n \nNoemi: I find the angle through which we approach a group important. Was particularly impressed by this podcast on telling **the story of a redeemed incel guy in two radically different ways.** It matters so much for how we see groups that are somehow special:\n\n[quote]\nAnd starting around 2000, the line starts to dip for all dimensions of empathy - either just understanding someone's position, which is called perspective taking, and empathic concern, the one about tender feelings. More students start saying it's not their problem to help people in trouble, not their job to see the world from someone else's perspective.

So I want to applaud your efforts to evaluate and investigate not only test outcomes but also the human experience of partaking in the programme. \n\nI see a few different problems and potential solutions to the case you are presenting.\n\nFirst the platform is too complex. So efforts must either be put into simplifying the platform, or raising the programme participants capability to use the platform. Perhaps in person lessons on how to use the platform?\n\nSecond, I imagine that as a refugee or migrant you can often feel the need for social interaction and support. The lessons before the introduction of the e-learning probably sated this need somewhat especially from the context of meeting others in the same position of being newcomers. As the lessons were removed the problem of isolation and loneliness grows as I imagine there are few other contexts where the newcomers have the chance to meet while having the \"excuse\" that it is to learn language rather than having to accept that they are meeting others because they are lonely.

Like death and taxes it seems! \n\nI was particularly drawn to the idea after the discussions between @matthias and @alberto following the early visit to the house in January, when thing were still getting going, I wanted to see how things had settled in to place following the arrival of the stable core members of the project teams.\n\nI found a very strong team of people who obviously love food, both eating and preparing, and shared many wonderful meals with them all. Meeting for breakfast, often lunch and always for dinner together. It was a good opportunity to catch up with people after a full day of doing different things, but not always as structured as it could be.\n\nSome thoughts / observations / suggestions follow:\n\n* There will always be those within a group who do not want to cook. There skills may lie elsewhere. This is acceptable, but needs to be easily available information, given without a value judgement. How the 'value' of some people always doing certain duties is balanced with the 'value' of those doing other duties is for people much better at economics and currency than me to understand. \n\n* There will often be those who may not want to eat at the same time as others. This needs to be considered better in a group situation. There is the danger of creating a 'tyranny of dinner time'. Especially if there is no set time for food to be prepared. The requirement to 'down tools (digital or otherwise) and attend the communal meal often with limited warning, and varying times of day can cause frustrations. I would suggest a visible opt-out system, so that, say around lunchtime anyone who did not wish to be included in evening meals would write their name on a self-catering list in the kitchen. I have experience of this system working at a month-long arts residency last summer. Every person there chose to opt out of communal dinner at least once a week, but there was always a communal meal taking place each evening. All comms was done through face to face and through shared whiteboards added to throughout the day. We even managed it one day when we had all taken a 24hr vow of silence! So it's doable under extreme circumstances.\n\n* A varied cuisine, prepared by diverse members of the community of the space is a great way to share and gain a better understanding of each other. I highly recommend it. However there is a danger involved when food prep times between cultures vary. During my 2 weeks at the house I noticed that when the Europeans were on food duty the prep and cooking time was often 60-90mins. More often than not one person working alone, with help from perhaps 1 other person. When MENA resident were on food duty prep and cooking times ran to 120-200 minutes and usually involved 3-4 participants in the kitchen. Food was always plentiful and excellent, but comparatively worth the 200% increase in human time investment? Probably not (in my opinion).\n\n* At least one meal a day must be at a structured regular time. I will always pick dinner as this meal as I think its best to discuss what has happened during the day and plans/ideas/hopes for the next day. But i also accept that i am not a morning person, so getting much out of me at a communal breakfast would be difficult. This also help everyone involved in the process plan better for the evening. If you know that food must be on the table at 7pm and takes 2 hrs to cook, you cant be going shopping for ingredients at 5:30pm.\n\nThese are all strategies for how to best structure the creation and eating of food in a system where many people are expected to contribute (mostly)equally to the cause. My gut reaction is that this system is probably not the best solution to a long term OV food culture across spaces. Here's why i think that:\n\n* It relies too heavily on passionate amateurs. How many times can i cook for a group of people before it's \"Alex's damn pasta dish\" again?\n* The risk of competitive cooking (as discussed by @alberto and @matthias [here](/t/id/8068)).\n* In a permanent OV structure it is vital that more time is spent thinking about food permaculture. If you are growing more of your own food to eat then you have to plan better and be more responsive to natural abundance. Otherwise there's so much need for shopping. As individual time cost for catering drops with larger numbers so there is a corresponding increase in time cost for resupplying (especially if your location is remote).\n* Isn't the provision of food for groups in a live/work environment a valid project in its own right? Why must it be an addendum to another 'valid' project. Food permaculture extends outside of all spaces and is guaranteed to have immediate use and value in every locality. That's why so many long-lived religious communities built themselves around the twin pillars of food and faith. Cheese, beer, wine, spirits, fruits, cured meats \u2026 there isn't one of those products that didn't support a monastery (and by an extension an entire local community) off the back of the food culture of the religious community within its walls.\n\nMy gut reaction is that in communities where the core membership of the OpenVillage space is going to exceed 8-10 permanent residents then one of those people has to be retained as a permanent head chef for the group. Perhaps with an allied project that looks at areas of food permaculture or food cultivation alongside, but where the kitchen, garden and local food community infrastructure are tied intimately together.\n\nAnyway, much more to add, but for now, I thought I'd throw open to the platform for responses.", "created_at": "2018-03-21 22:57:57.690087", "updated_at": "2018-03-22 08:11:29.394583", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1078, "wiki": false, "reads": 30, "score": 356.0, "like_count": 9, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3782, 137, 4, 4085, 3, 4275, 3703, 4265], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69548, "user_id": 4691, "topic_id": 12557, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi all!

My goal is to build it up into a pre-paper that uses some SF as a way to help the intuition. \n\nThe structure I imagine is this:\n\n1. Introduction to the Goodwin model (already done in the [notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/a7c814b919b321fb) by Marco @mstn).\n2. Discussion of the Goodwin model in a zero-growth steady state (already done  by Marco). Note: I remembered that Paolo Bacigalupi's *The windup girl* depicts a post-fossil fuel world where economic growth is propelled only by technical change. The relevant bit is that it contains a repression of any economic activity that might put further pressure on climate change, specifically sea levels (the novel is set in a Thailand where only Dutch-style water engineering keeps Bangkok from going underwater). Not sure if we can use it as a rendering for the steady state case.\n3. Add a more broken down discussion of the formula for `u_0` in the steady state. Specifically, I would like to discuss the idea that `alpha + beta = 0` in the \"Zero growth\" part of the notebook, does not necessarily mean that `alpha = beta = 0`. You could have positive population growth `beta` and negative labor productivity `alpha` (a \"Malthusian dark age\") or viceversa (a \"high-tech\" massive dieoff, like the Jackpot in William Gibson's *The peripheral*). \n\nBefore I do that, however, we need to define more rigorously the idea of steady state. \n\nIn system dynamics (physics), a system is considered to be in steady state if the rate of growth is constant for *all* of its state variables. And this is still a minimal definition: the Wikipedia entry reads to me like it requires *zero* growth for *all* state variables. \n\nIn economics, the definition of steady state tends to focus on the \"main\" state variables, like output and the stock of capital. I have not been able to confirm that this implies that that the other ones (like, in the Goodwin model, the share of output appropriated by labor and the unemployment rate) are allowed to vary.

And then you have to operate it with a 70 person crew + maintenance, fuel, etc.\nWind power costs 1.2 M$ per 1 MW. \n\nAlthough wind and solar are intermittent they generally produce more when more power is needed - so financially they are actually MORE attractive than a constant producer.\nOf course at SOME POINT this balance will shift - and then we can talk about what is best to fill or reduce those gaps but we aren't there. \nWe can discuss if nuclear barges (yay for the mobility, nay for the reliability), hometrainers, or whatever should be part of that effort.\nOn that front I offer you drawdown.org which has (on shore) wind on spot 2 I think and nukes on spot 20, right around better managed grazing and clean cook stoves. Just to put that into perspective.\n\nThen some of your claims re safety are badly wrong on multiple levels: \nNo safety issue for 99%?\nAbsolutely an issue for 100% of them. What you may have meant is that there were no INES (incidents) on 99%. And I would contest even that.\n50 Dead? \nI don't know why you keep bringing this up because unless you want to argue against coal (with me???) there really is no point as it is dwarfed by \"death through climate\". Apart from that I would prefer the measure of YLL (years of life lost) or DALY (disability adjusted life years) - because that will be important to capture the impact inapprapriate storage will have, particularly on young childs (who are far more susceptible to this) a) because they like to play in nature and ingestvalpha emmitters, and b) because they are still growing and radiation will then fuck with them so much worse.\n\nSooo, there's been only these 2 major incidents, and even they caused only 50 dead? So how bad could it possibly get? THIS IS BLATANT MISINFORMATION! And as I've said before: on a higher level this makes my alarm bells go into overdrive when I see this being peddled in what should be an honest and constructive discussion. YOU are part of the reason FUD (fear uncertainty and doubt) amounts to a very healthy survival instinct in this context. I am sorry to say, and I'd really like to see you convice me otherwise. \nDon't believe me? Type in \"[Kyshtym](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyshtym_disaster)\" in your search box. That one alone is 66+200 casualties (to date).\n\nWhen the discussion turns this disingenious (or blatently incompetent) I have trouble justiying going on at this point.\n\nYou of course you are free to rant on that nuclear barges should be shelled out for free to all and sundry like polio vaccinations and ignore that CAPEX is a thing. \nAnd then turn around and turn around and say that Russia is being mean for using its goddamn oil and gas as it chooses to see fit (for example SUPPLYING IT ALL THROUGH THE COLD WAR to the West).\n\nNow I am ardently not a fan of Putin (and let me reiterate: I am all for cramming the EU chock full of wind power, and DESERTEC the fuck out of MENA if you like), but the guy will not live forever and a unnecessarily (and a good bit IS necessary) and ineffective confrontational attitude is not going to pave a path to a happy geopolitical end to this.\n\nLet me add that I in no way want to diminish Poland's precarious situation in this context. I am well aware of that and I am very happy they got those Leos for cheap, and the EU has pushed a deal on Russia that allows full internal redistribution of gas without them having as much as a wimper to say on the matter. Those are effective geopolitical steps.\n\nProposing to use less resources to build out cheap and effective renewables and instead pouring them into a few nukes in Russia's periphery strikes me as shooting yourself in the foot with one hand and in the knee with the other.\n\nI'm sad to say Poland does not deserve, nor can it afford this kind of \"advocacy\".

The high mortality rate resulted in a drastic **decline in the labor force**.  **Wages rose** for both agricultural and urban workers. The survivors of the Black Death generally had a **higher standard of living than before the plague** [...] Because of the labor shortages, there was a move from labor-intensive farming such as cereal to livestock and increase both in industry and agriculture **more labor-saving devices employed**\n\nIn the South, dynamics were different:\n\n> After the Black Death, the elite responded to the labor shortages by strengthening the restrictions on the peasants and thereby strengthened feudalism in southern Italy.\n\nBasically, here we have a decline of work force without technological breakthroughs. Perhaps we can deduce it from the Jackpot-Goodwin model. Apparently (but still not sure), when workforce falls and tech increases, the profit rate is smaller in the Jackpot-Goodwin model.

I've been in an interesting position to try to understand this, as I've been trusted to come in to the core, while not being a director, employed or really in any way dependent on Edgeryders \u2013 financially or socially.\n\nFor a few months now, I've been on track to become a director of Edgeryders. My time looking at Edgeryders with one foot on the outside is coming to an end. So I thought I'd make the best of it and write down some thoughts before I drown in group think.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that I think we are in fact less strange and hard to pin down than we tell ourselves. I'm going to paint with broad strokes here. Please allow some blue-sky thinking and take my absolutes with a grain of salt \u2013 I just find it easier to think when allowed to indulge in grand statements.\n\nHere is what **I think** we are doing:\n\n* Our mission is to make it easier to think and and act together while retaining personal autonomy.\n\n* Collective thought and action without the right tools is expensive. It often leaves little room for autonomy, which is also expensive. We lower the cost and overhead of collective thought and action with replicable online/offline community building methods, and make collective sense-making accessible through innovative tools and practices.\n\n* Meanwhile, we constantly strive to improve autonomy of the individual in the collective while also maintaining bonds of trust and commitment. We don't like having bosses, we like thinking and acting together, but we also recognise that no boss is worse than the tyranny of consensus.\n\n* Our drive towards unorthodox organisational structures come from striking this balance, rather than from an ideological commitment to decentralisation or direct-democracy principles. \n\n* Finally, we believe that a network that balances these things can act as an extension of the intelligence of every individual in the network. Because of that, we are eager to connect to and incubate communities on the edges to extend the reach of our sensors into the world as far as possible.

(In my view: to make them commercially exploitable \u2013 with the climax being corporate social networks, monetizing on our friendships ...)\n\nSo, self-help communities are not simply a solution to unemployment and economic exclusion, they happen to imply that solution by abandoning the \"life as an employee\" model. But current employment policies are still centered around the employment model, trying to squeeze as many people into the capitalist market economy even when it does no longer \"grow\". Adverse side effects include unpaid internships and precarious work conditions.\n\nSo I question if a policy proposal for this should actually target employment policy at all at this time: it needs a paradigm change there first, and we pretty probably won't be the trigger to effect this. Maybe better find policies that are about supporting new sustainable lifestyles, and position the proposal in that area. The only way to position it in the employment policy area that I see is to make self-help communities attractive to governments as ways to \"square away\" unemployable people with very limited state support means (just donating some empty houses, unused areas for agriculture, and a kind of health care).\n\n", "created_at": "2012-11-05 16:06:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:41.541032", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 252, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71120, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11504, "post_number": 48, "raw": "[quote=\"petussing, post:47, topic:11504\"]\nBut I think zero-growth models are untenable \u2013 they would require that technology not advance.\n[/quote]\n\n\nPhilip!

This allows us to build several scenarios, and render them through sci-fi: \n\n* positive technical progress + declining *population* =>  William Gibson's Jackpot\n* positive technical progress + declining *active population* => Iain Banks' Culture\n* negative technical progress + increasing population => zombie apocalypse \n\netc. \n\nWith that said, I completely understand if you feel uneasy about going out on a limb with this stuff, and maybe brushing up on the limits to growth-degrowth literature is not of interest to you. :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2020-03-10 09:01:38.157451", "updated_at": "2020-03-10 09:01:38.157451", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 265, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [71116], "is_reply_to": [71116], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54201, "user_id": 5025, "topic_id": 9821, "post_number": 68, "raw": "Its clear that we need to discuss this topic, irl in depth some time.", "created_at": "2019-05-30 09:30:04.717574", "updated_at": "2019-05-30 09:30:04.717574", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 33.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [54198], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62924, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 11355, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@ilaria: to fill out based on\n1) everyone who registered + their bios. \n2) other contributors, curation team and organisers\n\nPS If possible, include photos too!", "created_at": "2019-11-04 12:23:28.166861", "updated_at": "2019-11-04 12:23:52.184628", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 22.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85132, "user_id": 6670, "topic_id": 14593, "post_number": 9, "raw": "[Journalist Association of Serbia](http://uns.org.rs/sr/konkurisi/posao.html) comes to mind.

However, it is surprising how many sci-fi (= not real) scenarios can be explained. In my opinion, it is a good teaching tool, at least.\n\nSo far, we have been able to back up at least six novels. The approach we followed has been: \"let's see what happens if we relax some mathematical constraints\". The approach is imo sound because it is the way to make the model less unrealistic, in the long term.\n\n> Yes, it is possible to have a zero-growth economy along with falling population, even accounting for technological improvement. But that is not \u201csteady state\u201d, because if the population continuously decreases you run out of people.\n\nOf course. As you said later, the Apocalypse is temporary as in the Jackpot, in the historical Black Death and in I Am Legend. \n\nWhat we can see from the model is that, in this sort of scenario, the standard of living could be higher **after** the Apocalypse.\n\nWe can see also that growth is not necessarily zero in a Jackpot scenario: growth can be bounded, it does not blow up as in the standard model, which is good in ecological terms.\n\n> what would stop people from doing the same things all over again\n\nNothing.

A smart community outperforms any of its members; this is the result of people working together, improving on each other\u2019s work. So, we use graph theory, combined with ethnography, to access the wisdom of the crowd. You can think of it as an artificial intelligence whose components are human beings. Our methodology is based on what we call [Semantic Social Networks ](http://bit.ly/digital-ethnography). It has several advantages:\n\n* **Robust**  to ill-defined questions. Exploratory questions are important. Who is doing the most interesting work on X? Which trends are emerging around Y? Free-form conversation minimizes framing biases and encourages serendipitous discovery.\n* **Scalable** . Edgeryders projects can result in large online conversations, with hundreds or thousands of participants. We use graph theory to aggregate them, and extract from them what is most important or unexpected.\n* **Rigorous** . Mining Semantic Social Networks yields qualitative and quantitative research. We apply network metrics to score and weigh the qualitative conclusions of ethnographers.\n* **Beautiful and intuitive** . Everything we do is a network, and networks are easy to visualize. In fact, most people find them intuitive and beautiful. We provide visualizations of our data with all our projects.\n\n### We develop and use our own Open Source tools for sensemaking and co-creation\n\nAn innovative suite of online software developed, customized and maintained by Edgeryders. The software has been developed in cooperation with leading universities and deployed in projects for the World Bank, United Nations Development Program. It has been supported by Grants from the Rockefeller foundation and funding for Horison2020 research.\n\n**Open Ethnographer: helps you to understand how communities make meaning and create culture, from the point of view of the community itself** . It is an open source tool for Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA), which is a way to systematize and understand long chunks of text and to make sense out of it. OpenEthnographer is used for \u201ccoding\u201d or tagging the content of online conversations, with awareness of how each tag fits into the social network of interactions.** It is a simple to use and intuitive tool that is key to other and more rich visualizations (ie through the use of Graphryder). Ethnography as always been a solitary science, Open Ethnographer is a new and scalable system that allows digital ethnography at an unprecedented scale, and because the goal of Ethnography is to understand communities make meaning and create culture, from the point of view of the community itself, OE is one of the first step to harness collective intelligence at work. It\u2019s developed for and by ethnographers, but can easily be taught to any community manager to keep track of an online conversation at depth.\nVideos: \n  * General intro to Ethnography: https://youtu.be/G_DoEa3lcBE\n  * Course Material: http://academy.edgeryders.eu/#open_ethnography\n  * Open Ethnographer Tool: [Demo](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dd5d18b391e19d39772dc44458be57068d3c31f5.mp4 )\n\n**EdgeSense: help you understand how much your community members are active and engaged in the conversation, which is key to understand different roles or project groups that could emerge during the period of activity.**  It is a dashboard that allows community administrator to understand their community. It\u2019s organized around a graphical representation of the community where nodes represents users and edges represent interactions.  **EdgeSense helps you take decision on your community management. For example is it possible to highlight or hide the role of moderators, and understand how much the community is self-sustainable or need a push from the center.**  Another possible analysis is based on the subcommunities that are active in and how dense the networks are between subcommunities. Analysis of nodes then help you understand how much your community members are active and engaged in the conversation, which is key to understand different roles or project groups that could emerge during the period of activity.\n\nVideos:\n * General intro to : \n  * Course Material:  [Masters of Networks](https://edgeryders.eu/t/masters-of-networks-a-participatory-way-to-cross-check-topic-identification/12400)\n  * Edgesense Tool: [Demo](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/6/65119d20090164ab7bbec2c921c456d2408b28bb.mp4 ) \n\n**Graphryder: Helps you navigate conversations at scale and gain insight into your community because it maps out a graph of the view of the community about sets of topics, and it can lead to unexpected solutions or original point of views.**  It is a dashboard tool that allow us to analyze the conversations that are happening in the community through reading of ethnographic data. Graphryder is based on innovative academic research which has led to publication in scientific journals. A dashboard represents conversations, and the fieldnotes made by researchers thereon, in network form. We call these networks semantic social networks, as they incorporate information on social interaction and their meaning. They encode a map of the associations between key concepts as perceived by informants as a group.

It must have been an amazing session.\n\nEmpower the teachers... Uh. OK. This is a lovely idea, it would probably be a very good thing to do. However, this empowerment of individuals or government employees, I must warn you, it has been hoped for, in the open government area. But no considerable leap was reached these past years. Unless we change the leadership model, and redistribute power from a vertical to an horizontal level, there can be no empowerment of individuals. As you mentioned, a national prerequisite, or program, tends to limit the empowerment levels.\n\nWe see this in business too. Managers are used to plan first, and then apply the action plan, without paying much attention to external factors, or input from employees or clients. Unexpected contributions can hardly fit in this managing's approach.\n\nThere has been a lot of discussions and debates about agility in open governments. Agility in education would not be so different from agility in open government, right?\n\nYou know, I have been blogging about individual, community and institutional empowerment for a couple of years, and nobody pays attention.

I was part of the discussion on scenarios for the regulation of AI, moderated by Justin Nogarede. The format was unusual, at least for me: a [fishbowl discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)) with four invited guests acting as icebreakers. These were **Marco Manca** @markomanka  (Member of Nato's Working group on Meaningful Human Control over AI-based systems); **Seda G\u00fcrses** @sedyst  (Department of Multi-Actor Systems at TU Delft); Justin @J_Noga : and myself. The People in the fishbowl kicked off, but then we melted in the general discussion as others stepped up to make contributions and ask questions. This worked very well, and enabled a lively discussion.\n\nIn general, **the group felt the need to spend quite some time to get a grip on a shared idea of what AI actually is**, and how it works, before he could discuss its regulation. Occasionally, the discussion veered into being quite technical, and not everybody could follow it all the time, even if we had an over-representation of computer scientists and digital activists. This is in itself a result: if this crowd struggles to get it, democratic participation is going to be pretty difficult for the general public. \n\nWe used [Chatham House rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule), so I in what follows I do not attribute statements to anyone in particular. \n\nWe kicked off by reminding ourselves that the new von der Leyen Commission has promised to [tackle AI within the first 100 days of taking office](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/blog-post/von-der-leyen-new-commission-take-aim-at-ai-legislation/). Brussels is mostly happy with how the GDPR thing played out, that is by recognizing the EU as the de facto \"regulatory superpower\". The AI regulation in the pipeline is expected to have a similar effect to that of GDPR.\n\n**Participants then expressed some concern around the challenges of regulating AI**. For example: \n\n* A  directive may be the wrong instrument. The law is good at enshrining principles (\"human-centric AI\"), but in the tech industry we are seeing *everyone*, including FAANG, claiming to adhere to the same principles. What we seem to be missing is an accountable process to translate principles into technical choices. For example, elsewhere I have told the story of how the developers of [Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) justified their refusal to give their users multiple-device accounts in terms of values: \"we want to serve the underconnected, and those guys do not own multiple devices. Multiple device account is a first world problem, and should be deprioritized\".\n* The AI story is strongly vendor-driven: a solution looking for a problem. Lawmaking as a process is naturally open to the contribution of industry, and this openness risks giving even more market power to the incumbents.\n* AI uses big data and lots of computing power, so it tends to live in the cloud as infrastructure. But the cloud is itself super-concentrated, it is infrastructure in few private hands. The rise of AI brings even more momentum to the concentration process. This brings us back to an intuition that has been circulating in this forum, namely that [you need antitrust policy to do tech policy](t/10868/2), at least in the current situation. \n* The term \"AI\" has come to mean \"machine learning on big data\". The governance of the data themselves is an unsolved problem, with major consequences for AI. In the health sector, for example, clinical data tend to be simply entrusted to large companies: the British NHS [gave them](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.co.uk%2F2019%2F09%2F19%2Ffive_nhs_trusts_do_data_deal_with_google_one_says_no%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHAd8EamUp9LY1ulHdC7mufXEXJcQ) to Deep Mind; a [similar operation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Feuropa.today.it%2Fattualita%2Funa-scelleratezza-consegnare-le-cartelle-cliniche-degli-italiani-all-ibm-rossi-attacca-il-governo.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFKARv42-MfE-a-cJN4t3VXIOvu6g) between the Italian government and IBM Watson was attempted, but failed, because data governance in Italy is with the regions, and they refused to release the data. We learned much about the state of the art of the reflection on data governance at MyData2019: to our surprise [there appears to be a consensus](/t/10893) among scholars on how to go about data governance, but it is not being translated into law. That work is *very* unfinished, and it should be finished *before* opening the AI can of worms.\n* AI has a large carbon footprint. Even when it does improve on actual human problems, it does so at the cost of worsening the climate, not in a win-win scenario. \n* The Internet should be \"human-centric\". But machine learning is basically statistical analysis: high-dimensional multivariate statistical models. When it is done on humans, its models (for example a recommendation algo) encode each human into a database, and then models you in terms of who you are similar to: for example, a woman between 35 and 45 who speaks Dutch and watches stand-up comedy on Netflix. Everything not standardizable, everything that makes you *you*, gets pushed to the error term of the model. That is hardly human-centric, because it leads to optimizing systems in terms of abstract \"typical humans\" or \"target groups\" or whatever. \n\nAs a result of this situation, **the group was not even in agreement that AI is worth the trouble and the money that it costs**. Two participants argued the opposite sides, both, interestingly, using examples from medicine. The AI-enthusiast noted that AI is getting good at diagnosing medical conditions. The AI-sceptic noted that medicine is not diagnosis-centric, but prognosis-centric; it has no value if it does not improve human life. And the prognosis must always be negotiated with the patient. IT in medicine has historically cheapened the relationship between patient and healer, with the latter \"classifying \" the former in terms of a standard data structure for entry into a database. \n\nSomebody quoted recent studies on the use of AI in medicine. The state of the art is:\n\n* Diagnostic AI does not perform significantly better than human pathologists. ([Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(19)30123-2/fulltext), [Ar.xiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07372))\n* Few studies do any external validation of results. Additionally, deep learning models are poorly reported. ([Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(19)30123-2/fulltext)) \n* Incorrect models bias (and therefore deteriorate) the work of human pathologists ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0300-7), [Ar.xiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07372))\n* There are risks that AI will be used to erode the doctor-patient relationship ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0300-7))\n\nBased on this, the participant argued that at the moment there is no use case for AI in medicine. \n\n![image|583x690](upload://aeIlSz6Ik4oTUfCoDyxG84J1Yo0.png) \n*Image credit: [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/)*\n\nWe agreed that not just AI, but all optimization tools are problematic, because they have to make the choice of what, exactly, gets optimized. What tends to get optimized is what the entity deploying the model wants. Traffic is a good example: apparently innocent choices as what to optimize for turn out to have huge consequences. When you design traffic, do you optimize for driver safety? Or for pedestrian safety? Of minimize time spent on the road? Airport layout is designed to maximize pre-flight spending: after you clear security, the only way to the gate goes through a very large duty free shop. This is \"optimal\", but not necessary optimal *for you*. \n\nWe next moved to **data governance**. Data are, of course, AI's raw material, and only those who have access to data can deploy AI models. A researcher called [Paul Oliver Dehaye](https://paulolivier.dehaye.org/stories/about.html) wants to model discrimination of certain workers. Do do this, he needs to pool the personal data from different individuals into what is called a \"data trust\". Data trusts are one of several models for data governance being floated about; the [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu/what-decode)'s data commons are another.  \n\nIn this discussion, even the GDPR's success appears to have some cracks. For example, Uber is using it to refuse it to give drivers their data, claiming that would impact the riders' privacy. A participant claimed that the GDPR has a blind spot in that it has nothing to say about standards for data portability. U.S. tech companies have a project called Data Transfer, where they are dreaming up those standards, and doing so in a way that will benefit them most (again). Pragmatically, she thought the EU should set its own standards for this.\n\nWe ended with some **constructive suggestions**. One concerned data governance itself. as noted above, the MyData community and other actors in the tech policy space have made substantial intellectual progress on data governance. Were this progress to be enshrined into EU legislation and standards setting, this would maybe help mitigate the potential of the AI industry to worsen inequalities. For example, saying \"everyone has a right to own their data\" is not precise enough. It makes a huge difference whether personal data are considered to be a freehold commodity or an unalienable human right. In the former case, people can sell their data to whomever they want: data would thus be like material possessions. In this case, market forces are likely to concentrate their ownership in few hands, because data are much more valuable when aggregated in humongous piles of big data. But in the latter case, data are like the right to freedom. I have it, but I am not allowed to sell myself into slavery. In this scenario, data ownership does not concentrate.\n\nAnother constructive suggestions concerned enabling a next-generation eIDAS, to allow for \"disposable online identities\". These are pairs of cryptographic keys that you would use for the purpose of accessing a service: instead of showing your ID to the supermarket cashier when you buy alcoholic drinks, you would show them a statement digitally signed by the registrar that says more or less \"the owner of this key pair is over 18\", and then sign it with your private key. This way, the supermarket knows you are over 18, but does not who you are.

First, the individual agent's behavior is modeled, and an equilibrium for the model is found. Next, economists build mesoscale models (for example, partial equilibrium models for a specific market) and macroscale ones (for example, general equilibrium models for the whole economy). These are built in such a way that the lower-level equilibria generate the upper-level ones: zoom in onto a general equilibrium model and it resolves into individual consumers and firms making their choices. \n\nThis consistency is useful and elegant. Alternative economic systems should also be micro-founded to be taken seriously. _Walkaway_, it seems to me, makes an attempt at building a micro-founded model of a whole system (the walkaway economy), but it comprehensively rejects standard micro. It eventually replaces it with a micro behavior of its own, but of a very different kind. I can see four moves:\n\n1. Expose standard micro as based on flawed assumptions.\n\n2. Argue that the behavior of individual agents is based on intersubjective conventions. This shifts the argument from economics as we know it to political economy, the border land between economics and moral philosophy.\n\n3. Propose a political economy that works well with digital commons, and re-build a micro model based on that. \n\n4. Proceed to derive meso- and macro-level behavior founded on those new micro models.\n\nIn the rest of this post, I go through each of these steps, one section per step. There is a section 5, just a quick recap and conclusion.\n\n\n#### 1. \"The origin story of Jacob Redwater\": the moral theory between the tragedy of the commons.\n\nAt the end of Chapter 1, Etcetera explains the tragedy of the common to Natalie:\n\n> \"Commons. Common land that belongs to no one. Villages had commons where anyone could bring their livestock for a day\u2019s grazing. The tragedy part is that if the land isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s, then someone will come along and let their sheep eat until there\u2019s nothing but mud. Everyone knows that that bastard is on the way, so they might as well *be* that bastard. Better that sheep belonging to a nice guy like you should fill their bellies than the grass going to some selfish dickhead\u2019s sheep.\"\n\n> \\[Natalie]: \"A fairy tale about giving public assets to rich people to run as personal empires because that way they\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re better managed than they would be if we just made up some rules? God, my dad must love that story.\u201d \n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s the origin story of people like your dad,\u201d Hubert, Etc said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious bullshit for anyone whose sweet deal doesn\u2019t depend on it not being obvious.\u201d\n\nTragedies of the commons happen because people are cold-blooded, selfish maximizers of their own utility. We all know this not to be true: calculating, selfish behavior happens in humans, but is far from the main engine of what humans do. And yet, the abstraction serves two purposes. As economists know, it makes human behavior tractable with the math available in the 1840s; this gave us an elegant, micro-founded model of the whole economy. But it also justifies giving Jacob Redwater and his peers domain over all things \u2013 it makes it moral, since all those other sheep-grazers are so amoral (\"some selfish dickhead\"). The same powerful people fund economics departments and co-opt economists into prestigious jobs: no wonder Natalie and Hubert encourage us to look for other possible foundations for economic behavior that do not have such a glaring conflict of interest problem.\n\nHowever, tragedies of the commons are not inevitable. We will come back to them in section 4.\n\n\n#### 2. \"The stories you tell come true\": a political economy of _Walkaway_\n\nJacob Redwater thinks that wanting to \"be that bastard\" who will overgraze the common field is _human nature_. The impulse to greed and appropriation is hardwired in our neurons. Standard microeconomics agrees: just assume it, and build your model on top of it. Doctorow thinks that human societies can, to a certain extent decide what they want to want, and then socialize their members to want those things. In part, this is just obvious: in the real world, parents are forever trying to teach small children not to prevaricate others, to be mindful of other's needs, to wait for their turn etc. To a large part, they succeed. \n\nIn the world of _Walkaway_, walkaways are forever trying to internalize the heuristics that work well to navigate their lifestyle, some of which are counter-intuitive not only to us readers, but to them. This is explained by example in chapter 2 by Limpopo to Natalie (now become Iceweasel), Etcetera and Seth. Natalie:\n\n>  \"I\u2019m not supposed to trade anything for anything else, it\u2019s all a gift, like the Communist parties. That part I understand. But when we do our parties, we don\u2019t care how much you take because at any second the cops are going to chase us out and destroy whatever\u2019s left over, so you can have whatever you can carry. Out here, you want people to magically not take too much but also not earn the right to take more by working harder and also to work because it\u2019s a gift but not because they expect anything in return?\u201d \n\n> They stared at her. She shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s the walkaway dilemma. If you take without giving, you\u2019re a mooch. If you keep track of everyone else\u2019s taking and giving, you\u2019re a creep scorekeeper. It\u2019s our version of Christian guilt\u2014it\u2019s impious to feel good about your piety. You have to want to be good, but not feel good about how good you are. The worst thing is to be worrying about what someone else is doing, because that has nothing to do with whether you\u2019re doing right.\u201d \n\n>She shrugged. \u201cIf it was easy, everyone would do it. It\u2019s a project, not an accomplishment.\u201d\n\nAnd again:\n\n> \"Back out there in \u2018default reality\u2019 [...] you\u2019re supposed to be doing things because they\u2019re right for you. [...] Out here, we\u2019re supposed to treat generosity as the ground state. The weird, gross, selfish feeling is a warning we\u2019re being dicks. We\u2019re not supposed to forgive people for being selfish. We\u2019re not supposed to expect other people to forgive us for being selfish. It\u2019s not generous to do nice things in the hopes of getting stuff back. It\u2019s hard not to fall into that pattern, because bribery works.\"\n\nThe language of effort (\"we are supposed/not supposed to...\") and self-reprogramming (\"the feeling is a warning that..\") is evident. But the results are worth the effort, because in the end, as Limpopo says: \n\n> \u201c\u2018The stories you tell come true.\u2019 If you believe everyone is untrustworthy, you\u2019ll build that into your systems so that even the best people have to act like the worst people to get anything done. If you assume people are okay, you live a much happier life.\u201d\n\nIn other words, \"human nature\" leaves a lot of space for deciding how humans interact to produce an economy. This decision is collective, hence political. Doctorow is making the shift back from economics to [political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy). This latter term was replaced by \"economics\" in the course of the 20th century, emphasizing the mathematical side of economic modelling and de-emphasizing its political and moral side. Smith, Ricardo, Malthus and Marx believed these sides to be very important, and economics itself to be a branch of moral philosophy. Doctorow clearly agrees.\n\n\n#### 3. \"Work needed doing, and he could help\": optimising for commons production and maintenance\n\nAs we have seen, Doctorow believes human nature to be less rigid than standard economics makes it to be. But if humans are programmable, what should we program ourselves for? And what, specifically, would be the object of programming?\n\nThe answer seems to be this: **we should program into ourselves an ethos that supports practices of networked collaboration, aimed at the production of commons**. This is my own conclusion, but I think it is supported by plenty of material in _Walkaway_ itself (especially Chapter 2) as well as Doctorow's [Crooked Timber essay](http://crookedtimber.org/2017/05/10/coases-spectre/) originated from an online discussion of the novel. In the author's words:\n\n> It\u2019s a novel about solving Ronald Coase\u2019s [coordination puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_firm) using networked tools. (link Doctorow's).\n\n_Walkaway_'s most actionable parts are tips and tricks for better coordination. For example, in open collective efforts it is important to pretend mistakes just happen, and are nobody's fault \u2013 even though, of course, they are.\n\n> If you planted a piece of structural steel in a way that the building really couldn\u2019t work with and ignored the rising chorus of warnings, someone else would be told that there was a piece of \u201cmisaligned\u201d material and tasked to it, with high urgency. It was the same error that the buildings generated if something slipped. The error didn\u2019t assume that a human being had fucked up through malice or incompetence. \n\n> The initial theory had been that an error without a responsible party would be more socially graceful. People doubled down on their mistakes, especially when embarrassed in front of peers. The name-and-shame alternate versions had shown hot-cheeked fierce denial was the biggest impediment to standing up a building.\n\nA whole subplot is dedicated to comprehensively demolishing the reputation economy idea. For us Econ-SciFi types, this is intriguing since the nomad society in Bruce Sterling's _Distraction_ is based on \"reputation servers\". But Doctorow clearly hates it.\n\n> You couldn\u2019t be a walkaway without encountering the reputation economy freaks.\n\nJackstraw (later Jimmy) is the character arguing for reputation to be an explicit, bankable asset in walkaway. It starts with him wanting to install leaderboards on the Belt&Braces building wiki/repo. Limpopo takes the opposite side. For starters, it does not make sense to claim that the person with the most _visible_ contributions is the person who committed most, because everything we do is standing on the shoulders of giants. In her words:\n\n> \"The most commits in our codebase come from history\u2014everyone who wrote the libraries and debugged and optimized and patched them. The most commits on this building come from everyone who processed the raw materials, figured out how to process the raw materials, harvested the feedstock.\u201d\n\nThis not only makes sense, but is fully consistent with economic analysis. Nobel laureate Herbert Simon noted in 2000: \n\n>If we are generous with ourselves, I suppose that we might claim that we \u201cearned\u201d as much as one-fifth of our income. The rest of the patrimony [is] associated with being a member of an enormously productive social system, which has accumulated a vast store of physical capital, and an even larger store of intellectual capital \u2013 including knowledge, skills, and organizational know-how held by all of us. ([reference](https://doi.org/10.2307/420911) \u2013 quoted by Mariana Mazzucato in her _The value of everything_)\n\nJackstraw appreciates that, but those people are not at the Belt&Braces. In his view, the community should still honor Limpopo's large contribution. But she won't have it, because it would give her, and everyone else, the wrong incentives: \n\n> \u201cIf you do things because you want someone else to pat you on the head, you won\u2019t get as good at it as someone who does it for internal satisfaction. We want the best-possible building. If we set up a system that makes people compete for acknowledgment, we invite game-playing and stats-fiddling, even unhealthy stuff like working stupid hours to beat everyone. A crew full of unhappy people doing substandard work. If you build systems that make people focus on mastery, cooperation, and better work, we\u2019ll have a beautiful inn full of happy people working together well.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion,\n\n> [...] Getting humans to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d by incentivizing them to vanquish one another was stupid.\n\nThese statements are important in _Walkaway_, because they dispose of methodological individualism. The reasoning works like this: \n\n*  Most people like building things together. As long as the two elements of building and sociality are present, you do not need to obsess too much about incentives. In practice, you can blackbox individual behavior: observe what they do, then build a model in which they do it. No need to derive this behavior as the equilibrium strategy of a problem. This is a position close to [behavioral economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics).  In chapter 4, Etcetera exemplifies it:\n\n>  Etcetera felt the tension melt out of his back, replaced with warm purpose. Work needed doing, and he could help. What more could anyone ask for?\n\n* What matters, instead, are technologies for cooperation. Groups of humans that are better at cooperating will prosper at the expense of other groups that are not as good. Groups of humans get better at cooperating by adopting systems of rules that make cooperation easier. Therefore, humans are subject to evolutionary pressure both at the individual level and at the group level, and at the group level the pressure is cultural. This is the interpretation proposed by cultural evolution biologists like [E.O. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Conquest_of_Earth) and  [Joseph Henrich](https://secretofoursuccess.fas.harvard.edu/).\n\n* It follows that an effective economic theory should not focus on individual behavior as an equilibrium of a set of individual incentives, but on system-level behavior as an equilibrium of interaction protocols. \n\n\n#### 4. \"First days of a better nation\": the meso- and macro- levels of the walkaway economy\n\nIn _Walkaway_, the Belt&Braces and other walkaway settlements stand in as examples of how the walkaway economy works at the mesoscale. The full-blown, hard SF world of the final chapters stands in as a walkaway economy at the macroscale. The latter is not as well specified, so we ignore it in what follows.\n\nMost readers will probably like what they see: a mixture of extreme personal freedom (no managers, no wages) and effective cooperation. Once you have replaced the \"human nature\" of economics with the agreed-upon rules of political economy, and methodological individualism and incentives with a behavioral approach and protocols of interaction, these outcomes make a lot of sense. Part of Doctorow's argument is that everyone has direct experience of these outcomes anyway. \n\nThis point is, I believe, best made by David Graeber in his treatment of communism in [Debt: The First 5,000 Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years). The argument goes like this: stipulate that communism consists in adhering to the principle \"from each according to their abilities, to each according to her needs\". Then, writes Graeber,\n\n> Almost everyone follows this principle if they are collaborating on some common project. If someone fixing a broken water pipe says, \u201cHand me the wrench,\u201d his co-worker will not, generally speaking, say, \u201cAnd what do I get for it?\u201d\u2014even if they are working for Exxon-Mobil, Burger King, or Goldman Sachs. The reason is simple efficiency (ironically enough, considering the conventional wisdom that \u201ccommunism just doesn\u2019t work\u201d): **if you really care about getting something done, the most efficient way to go about it is obviously to allocate tasks by ability and give people whatever they need to do them.** [emphasis mine]\n\nIn these cases, communism is simply more efficient. No need to keep scores of who got what for what; no need for currencies, value storage, means of exchange. The overhead is low to the point of vanishing, especially if \"the most commits come from history\", _and most important things have a public good nature_, like infrastructure and digital commons. Doctorow clearly thinks this to be the case. Limpopo:\n\n> The anthropocene is about collective action, not individuals. That\u2019s why climate change is such a clusterfuck. In default, they say that it\u2019s down to individual choice and responsibility, but reality is that you can\u2019t personally shop your way out of climate change. If your town reuses glass bottles, that does one thing. If it recycles them, it does something else. If it landfills them, that\u2019s something else, too. Nothing you do, personally, will affect that, unless it\u2019s you, personally, getting together with a lot of other people and making a difference.\u201d\n\nSo, walkaways build an economy by the simple expedient of making it easy, efficient and pleasurable to work on common projects. Special emphasis is given to the production of public and common goods. This is not necessarily far-fetched, even for economists: Nobel laureate [Elinor Ostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom) showed that collective choice and institution design can beat \"human nature\", and ensure long-term stewardship of depletable common goods, with no tragedy of the commons.  At this point, the low overhead of communism kicks in and makes them vastly more efficient than anything in default.\n\nAn interesting component of efficiency is that stupid shit simply does not get produced. This is because you cannot blackmail people into doing something they don't believe in by leveraging scarcity, so there are no jobs. As Gretyl says:\n\n> \"As though we need jobs! I mean, if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m sure of, it\u2019s that I never want to have a job again. I do math because I can\u2019t stop. Because I\u2019ve found people who need my math to do something amazing. \u201cIf you need to pay me to do math, that\u2019s because a) you\u2019ve figured out how to starve me unless I do a job, and b) you want me to do boring, stupid math with no intrinsic interest.\"\n\nMaking it easy, efficient and pleasurable to work on common projects is by no means easy.  _Walkaway_ contains plenty of interaction protocols meant to make cooperation easier. The bucket brigade concept is presented as a textbook example of how cooperation should work: \n\n> Bucket brigades only ask you to work as hard as you want\u2014rush forward to get a new load and back to pass it off, or amble between them, or vary your speed. It didn\u2019t matter\u2014if you went faster, it meant the people on either side of you didn\u2019t have to walk as far, but it didn\u2019t require them to go faster or slower. If you slowed, everyone else stayed at the same speed. Bucket brigades were **a system through which everyone could do whatever they wanted\u2014within the system\u2014however fast you wanted to go; everything you did helped and none of it slowed down anyone else.** [emphasis mine]\n\nMany obstacles to cooperation are psychological: ego, guilt, vanity. So, walkaways pay attention to defuse these things as much as possible.\n\n> One piece of walkaway-fu was to apologize quickly and thoroughly when you fucked up.\n\nOr\n\n> The core idea was that radical or difficult ideas were held back by the thought that no one else had them. That fear of isolation led people to stay \u201cin the closet\u201d about their ideas, making them the \u201clove that dares not speak its name.\u201d So lovedaresnot (shortened to \u201cDare Snot\u201d) gave you a way to find out if anyone else felt the same, without forcing you to out yourself. [A detailed description follows]\n\nOr my favorite: when Limpopo is confronted by Jimmy's militia having taken over the B&B, people suddenly start to hoard stuff, as they are (rightly) worried that it will become scarce under the new regime. So Limpopo makes tea, passes it around and finds in her bag warm clothes to give to people who are less well equipped than she is.\n\n> As soon as she shared, the hoarding impulse melted.\n\nThis is consistent with Chwe 2009, [Communication and Coordination in Social Networks](https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/67/1/1/1576191).\n\n\n#### 5. A (very) new economy\n\nAt this point, I think I have made a case that the economics of _Walkaway_ does, indeed, fill our bill of \"imagining an economic system completely different from what we have\". Human nature is conceived as leaving plenty of space for \"programming\" societies by educating individuals. The engine of progress is competition between different protocols for cooperating. Individual freedom guarantees efficiency, because people will not waste their time making stupid shit like network-connected 200 EUR garbage bins. The economy of _Walkaway_ produces different things, in different ways and for different goals than the default economy we all live in.\n\nThis is highlighted by the uncharitable treatment that economists get in the book. The job of trashing the discipline is given to Gretyl \u2013 ironically, a mathematician. Economists owe much of their discipline's fortunes to its willingness to deploy in the justification for the position of the ruling classes (\"zottas\") at the apex of society:  \n\n> \u201cYour dad hires economists for intellectual cover, to prove his dynastic fortunes and political influence are the outcome of a complex, self-correcting mechanism with the mystical power to pluck the deserving out of the teeming mass of humanity and elevate them so they can wisely guide us. They have a science-y vocabulary conceived of solely to praise people like your father. \"\n\nThey are compared to astrologists:\n\n> \"I think you have to be a mathematician to appreciate how full of shit economists are, how astrological their equations are. No offense to your egalitarian soul, but you lack the training to understand how deeply bogus those neat equations are.\u201d\n\nI don't completely understand this last one. Still. I rest my case. :smile:", "created_at": "2018-07-14 15:13:15.758447", "updated_at": "2019-09-20 15:50:56.819288", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3659, "wiki": false, "reads": 53, "score": 11105.6, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904, 5, 4497, 1935, 4196, 5145], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72065, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11504, "post_number": 56, "raw": "[quote=\"petussing, post:55, topic:11504\"]\nThat\u2019s the trouble with following evidence: there is so damn much of it.

One thing to keep in mind is that \"the market\" includes everything from giant wealth funds buying and selling billions in financial assets every day, to a small food producer selling in the local farmer's market. Thinking/talking about it as if it's all one thing is to simplify to the ridiculous.\n\nMy focus on systemic regulatory change to make the costs of climate change visible to the market (carbon pricing/disclosure/labeling) is indeed short term. Specifically my time horizon is 2030, by which time we have to cut global emissions in half. All the \"ologies\" and \"isms\" in the world are useless when the task is right in front of our face right now. There's a difference between wanting to be right and wanting to get things done. And for those who want to get things done and who are asking \"what do I do\", I would suggest it makes sense to focus, focus, focus on the most important thing you can find - the point in all the complexity that has the leverage and where the biggest effects (measured in emissions reduction) can be had from small, realistic efforts and specific actions.\n\nFor me those actions involve unpaid political lobbying focusing on the only carbon pricing model that has a hope of making carbon very, very expensive (i.e. carbon dividends). For me that is a \"new paradigm of economic and societal change\". Here in Ireland another \u20ac20/ton (6 cents on 1L of petrol, etc.) would pay every person a carbon dividend of \u20ac180 per year. That's a \u20ac360 dividend for a couple. A few years later the tax is \u20ac40/ton and they're getting \u20ac720. At \u20ac80 the dividend is nearly \u20ac1,500. And that's without taxing aviation fuel, agricultural emissions, or the ETS polluters. Border carbon tariffs would incentivise other nations - and put more revenue into the pot for even bigger dividends.\n\nAnd on the business side, paying the bills, I teach anybody who'll pay me to teach them about this stuff in one way or another, and basically show them why it's important to identify, reduce and sell their carbon before the rest of the market does. If I ever get time, I'll encourage the labeling of every fuel purchase, airline ticket, electricity bill and bag of coal with clear, unambiguous information about what this is and what the consequences of buying it/using it are. Maybe even a photo of a flooded Bangladeshi family, or a starving polar bear - whichever tests best.\n\nMoney and price affects behaviour no matter what you believe, care about, or understand. If you put your pension into an investment, you deserve to know what climate is going to do to that investment. And if you're going to fly to Prague for the weekend, not only should you be paying through the nose for the damage you're doing, but the effects and consequences of your choices should be available right there on your ticket and boarding pass. Carbon pricing, disclosure, and labeling make climate change visible in a powerful way, in every single purchasing and investment decision.\n\nThere are many interconnected solutions that might help us cut global emissions in half by 2030 but, being systemic, these three, big policy solutions help them all. IMHO, for those concerned about climate and who consider the potential impact (measured in actual emissions reductions), these policies of climate visibility deserve more attention and support than they get.", "created_at": "2019-09-16 20:16:40.729926", "updated_at": "2019-09-17 15:46:16.365637", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 603, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 36.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72408, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 12885, "post_number": 11, "raw": "I participated and yes, there were initially some issues with connectivity.

Nowadays as many as 2 out of 5 young people are unemployed in some countries. Despite global development of the standards of living, poverty is still a reality for many around us - the elderly, the young, the urban and the rural populations. \n\nWe struggle with access to good, affordable care.\n\nWe can't afford a comfortable house, or to start a family. \n\nWhat about minimal wage? About social care and support? Good schools and healthy food? Retirement when we're older? Can there be enough of everything for all of us to lead happy, fulfilled lives? \n\n**We need to talk about it.\nThis summer, we are going on a tour to meet the humans of Europe who would like to join the story of the future, in a community of peers.**\n\nWellbeing in Europe is a community effort where people from different countries meet and share ways to get better health, more work opportunities, more moral support and ways of being well in this life. \n\nYour story is key to understanding the bigger picture. \n\nCommunities dealing with the same issues are key to finding solutions to these problems. By understanding the challenges and building alliances we're providing new scenarios for the futures we want to live in. \n\nCome to the POPREBEL Tour stop in your country! Meet outstanding people and hear their stories, and take the opportunity to share your own experience.\n\nExtra bonus: Some of the stories collected during these events will be awarded [200 eur prizes](https://edgeryders.eu/t/show-us-stories-that-matter-become-an-expert-in-a-topic-and-get-paid-200/9823). \n\nAnd, we will invite you to help us build an event that will take place in your city/country later this year.

Write texts for invitations to the events\n4. Collaborate with the social media manager to do online promotion of the physical event.\n5. Follow the process defined by the Outreach Director for regular dissemination of participant-submitted stories and discussions happening on the platform.\n6. Participate in the online discussions on the online form, starting by sharing their own answers to the questions, and reading and commenting on what others write.\n\n**We invite you to set up a local event in your town that will take place in November 2019**. This event is part of a global festival that brings together the members of Edgeryders, a network of 5000 individuals and organizations who do inspiring work to tack social, economic, environmental and political problems in over 80 countries. \n\n## Connectors take a set of actions as detailed below:\n\n**BEFORE THE EVENT:**\n\n* **Participate in a Local Connectors training in Brussels in June/July 2019** where you will meet the rest of the team. You will work and learn with people from Serbia, Czech Republic, Sweden, Romania, Iceland, Germany, Italy and beyond. **The cost of your travel and accommodations will be covered by us**.\n\n* Host a series of Virtual Cafes calls in your own language where more people from other parts of your country and from abroad can meet and discuss together what they have learned from the stories that have been posted on the online community forum. \n\n* Engage 50 people from different backgrounds in your village, town, city, country to share their stories around these three topics and help them to post these stories on the online community forum: Healthcare and Social care services, Work and Prosperity, Spirituality and Moral Wellbeing. \n* Together with the people who you have brought into the online community and virtual cafes, produce the program for the local event in the festival. \n\n**DURING THE EVENT**\n* Ensure that the event is documented in writing and with video following the method and format we will teach you at the training in June/July. \n* Make sure you collect all the documentation material in one place and structure it well so that it is easy for those who could not come in person still can participate in the discussion.\n\n**AFTER THE EVENT:**\n* Engage the participants to share their experiences of the event on the online platform\n* Write one article to summarise what happened,  what was learned and your own thoughts on the next steps based on your experience during the fellowship.\n\n## How to apply\n\n1. Create an account on edgeryders.eu\n2.  Introduce yourself to the community by writing a post about yourself in [[the Wellbeing category]](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing)(https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing) (you can do it in English, Polish, Czech or Serbian) = ADD A NEW TOPIC :) \n3. Pick _one_ of our thematic topics, click on it and follow the instructions you find there: [Health and social care services](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-do-we-get-health-and-social-care-support/9665), [Work and Prosperity](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-do-we-access-work-and-prosperity/9664) or [Spirituality and Moral wellbeing](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-can-we-be-morally-and-psychologically-well/9666). \n4. Then find one other person, ideally someone who is not used to using internet forums. Interview them so that you get \"deeper\" answers to the same questions you answered. Make sure to record or transcribe the interview.\n5.  Help them to produce a good article presenting what they said during your interview with them. A good way to do this is to give them the transcript of the conversation so that they can edit it till they are happy with its contents._\n6. Guide them through the process of creating an account and posting their article in the right place.and have the interviewee post it [here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing). \n7. Leave a comment on their article, sharing your own thoughts on the conversation you had so that we know you were the one who brought in the new person.\n\nDeadline: 14th of June 2019, midnight CET\n\n## How we will select connectors\n**We are looking for 3 people who speak one or more of these three languages: Polish, Serbian, Croatian or Czech.** _It is easier for us if you also speak some English._\n\n**We will consider individuals who demonstrate an interest in Wellbeing in Europe and alignment with our intentions in the following ways** (each item will receive a score from 0 the minimum, to 5 the maximum, which will be summed to define the final score used to choose the winners):\n\n* are registered on [edgeryders.eu ](http://edgeryders.eu/) and have introduced themselves in the [Wellbeing in Europe online community forum](https://edgeryders.eu/c/wellbeing).\n\n* are empathetic, curious and able to engage people from different walks of life in an authentic, constructive and respectful discussion about important topics. \n\n* demonstrate a willingness to collaborate with others and use online tools such as video chats for communication, engagement, documentation of work.\n\n* Live in either Poland, The Czech Republic or Serbia.\n\n## What happens if I am selected?\n\nYou will be working closely with the Edgeryders team to build the Wellbeing in Europe community conversation and together with its members, put together the program for this year's edition of the annual Edgeryders Festival which gathers our global community. These festivals are much appreciated and we think you will find this experience rewarding and enjoyable.\n\n## What happens if I am not selected?\nYou could get a 200 Eur reward for the article that you have contributed as part of the application process. More information about this here: http://bit.ly/2LbQvyD\n\n\n## For more information\n[Come to an Online Gathering](http://edgeryders.eu/t/register-for-an-online-gathering/9586) in your country's language or (if not available) in English. \n\n## Additional:\n\n**The event follows a specific methodology** that we have designed to generate opportunities for learning, skill development and paid work both for the organisers as well as the participants.  Each event involves a preparatory phase in which people from diverse backgrounds share and discuss their experiences on our online forum.  \n\n**We use this methodology for two reasons.** \n1. In a polarised social and political environment, the dialogue is seldom happening between people who have different perspectives. We feel it is important to overcome these barriers.\n\n2. The second is to ensure that our findings from the academic research project which is financing this fellowship program is based on the lived reality and perspectives of people from many different walks of life. \n\n**What does the local connector do?**\n\nLocal Connectors are the highly active members that put our mission into action day by day: building a pan European movement of citizens who share ways to be healthy and prosper in Europe. They are community leaders who engage other people to join Wellbeing in Europe. They participate in the co-creation of the Festival and take part in decision-making processes. Local connectors mostly engage on one or several of the following:\n\n* **Organise a local event as part of a global festival :** host a number of online virtual cafes and one physical event to reach new people who will become participants in the conversation.\n\n* **Actively mobilize their network and local community** (in a city, region or country) to come to the virtual cafes and the physical event in order to involve them in sharing their stories with peers in different parts of the country and Europe.\n\n* **Provide documentation:** ensure sessions and discussions are thoroughly reported back on the platform and feed into the global conversation\n\n## Why\n\n**Europe is not well.** \n\n**Current data on demographics shows that every year we are 1 million more, we live longer, but the years added to our lifespan are not healthy years.** All of Europe&rsquo;s unemployment rates are on the rise since 2008, but nowadays as many as 2 out of 5 young people are unemployed in some countries. \n\nBeing university trained is no longer seen as competitive, manual professions and crafts are looked down upon, physical labor is brought down to minimum wage or the grey economy. \n\nAt the same time, the digital economy is growing 7 times as fast as the rest of the economy, but education and skills reconversion are lagging. Who is going to keep up the fight, when our kids are asking what is the point of an education if our planet has no future? \n\n**Environmental disasters, terrorist attacks, the breakdown of solidarity and social cohesion\u2026** are just some of the contours of a long-term social crisis, of which we all are protagonists. The big contradiction is: how come entire populations are not able to benefit from humanity&rsquo;s progress and live in stability and prosperity?\n\nEdgeryders is a company living in symbiosis with an online community of thousands of hackers, activists, radical thinkers and doers, and just normal people that want to make a difference. We believe that a smart community outperforms any of its members; this is the result of people working together, improving on each other\u2019s work.\n\n**We want to come together and help one another** find the right ways to navigate the changes that are happening in different parts of the world.\n\n* **How can we build good lives against a backdrop of massive social, economic, political challenges?**\n\n* **How can we create opportunities for ourselves and where can we support one another better?** In work, health, family, community life.\n\n* **How can we build the evolution of the Internet and our technologies so that they support these efforts?**\n\n**We believe there are alternatives, but they are hidden and not central enough to be able to propel change on a massive scale.**\n\nIn response, we are building a global Festival to share and collect snapshots of solutions which are being tried at the very level of our everyday lives, and use smart social networks to accelerate the spread reliable information and tested approaches.\n\n**Good for you:** You join a pan European movement of researchers, citizen experts, funders etc. Individuals and organizations who are building a new narrative about where we are going and how problems can be solved at the local, and European level. By growing your network, you can access opportunities for your personal and professional development.\n\n**Good for everyone:** We learn who others are, what they are doing to solve problems, and how we can support one another more effectively. By putting together the different perspectives of people from different walks of like and parts of Europe in the same conversation, we can see the bigger picture. By putting together the lived experiences \"on the ground\" of different people, we can and identify credible strategies and contributions make an impact on messy problems that impact everyone and that no one can solve by themselves.", "created_at": "2019-04-11 07:40:27.927651", "updated_at": "2019-07-30 12:36:08.006613", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2049, "wiki": false, "reads": 60, "score": 1976.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3067, 3, 3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44058, "user_id": 4357, "topic_id": 8460, "post_number": 11, "raw": "There are Blockchain meetups at DigitYser (and we organize even a blockchain bootcamp, I need to check if still accurate what I say)\nhttps://digityser.org/#events\n\nFeel free to explore!

The first pilot was launched by @zmorda and @Sohayeb, right? Is it running according to the schedule on the website, currently between Stage 4 (Deliverables) and 5 (Evaluation)?\n\nI'd love to learn more about the current challenges to see how I could be useful more immediately. Are there any upcoming calls I could join?\n\nPerhaps I can already share some questions and thoughts I had. I'm quite new here, so I might not understand all of the existing context and I apologize in advance if I step on any toes here.\n\nFirst off, in regards to @zmorda's question on mentors, what kind of mentoring should this be - e.g. questions like in-person/online, once a week/month/quarter meetings, paid/unpaid mentors, are they trained/untrained, what seniority level, industry access (can they open doors?)?\n\n- The infrastructure needs depends on the type of mentoring you'd like. I don't quite understand the P2P in this context - in what regard is the mentor a peer to the mentee? \n  I think there's indeed merit in a mentor who isn't way ahead (often, successful entrepreneurs with don't really remember / romanticize what it was like to start out small) but only a few steps, however then you might need to provide the mentors more structure to make the sessions effective. This could even be a learning/growth opportunity for the mentors.\n- The two key constraints in building your mentor network is: Who do you have easy/easiest access to? and What will bring the most impact to the mentees? Do you have a theory for the second question? My hypotheses are that:\n\t- a) Outsider perspectives are useful (like in @hugi's example), but the successful entrepreneurs in the region have often had help from local connections who can open up doors - to potential clients, to media outlets, to institutions. The \"[wasta](http://www.danielpipes.org/642/wasta-the-hidden-force-in-middle-eastern-society)\" concept is still an important factor in a business' success. \n\t- b) What kinds of output or outcomes do you expect from the mentoring? If I understood @nadia correctly, there's a very structured process for this, and I'm wondering where to learn more.\n\t- c) I think the best mentors have some sort of skin in the game, that they really become a stakeholder in their mentees. I think there's lots of innovation potential here.\n\t- d) I understand that the target \"beneficiary\" has not created their social venture yet, but may or may not have an idea. I think that at this early stage, mentoring should happen alongside a more structured training process, and there's lots of overlap in the early stages.\n- Have you checked out other models to learn from or even partner with? I think Bridge4Billions' [online training tool](https://bridgeforbillions.org/business-tools/) is quite excellent (they're not yet in the region, but might be interested), there's also the Lebanon-based [pitchworthy.co](https://www.pitchworthy.co/methods) which is quite comprehensive in its ambition (not sure how the actual program addresses all of these aspects they describe) but I love that it's a local initiative, and specifically for mentoring, [mowgli](https://mowgli.org.uk/what-we-do/why-mentoring) has a mentoring training program they run in MENA.\n\nSome more general thoughts:\n\n- Social entrepreneurship is very trendy, and ESOs (entrepreneurship support orgs) seem to be what everyone wants to do - it often feels like there's more ESOs than entrepreneurs! I think it's useful to understand the context of things happening, how aware are you of other ESOs in the region, particularly those supporting social innovation? Just to name a few, there's Enactus, Endeavour, Endeva, Ashoka, Yunus Social Business, INJAZ, Pitchworthy, SEED, Unreasonable Institute, SPARK, RIBH MENA, Flat6Labs (to some degree social), Enpact (mentoring focus) etc. - I think there's a lot to learn from understanding their models, to either collaborate instead of reinventing the wheel, and/or fill missing gaps in the ecosystem. I think this could be key - this isn't a blank canvas, and there's lots of opportunities to support local developments rather than competing with them. I have more than a few thoughts on this, but at the moment those are better discussed than written out.\n- When you say social innovation, is there an impact evaluation framework by which you would classify who you support and who not? How would you measure success of the program (e.g. number of entrepreneurs, revenue of their ventures, jobs created, social/ecological impact created, survival rate of ventures, share of female/rural/poor entrepreneurs, etc.)?\n- Many programs focus on the urban centers, and often reach more privileged parts of society. Reaching the \"poverty pockets\", often in rural parts, is something local orgs are increasingly trying, but there's even more resources needed in this area. Again, coalition-building could be crucial here.\n- My biggest learning is that creating progams at this scale across multiple countries, governance is critical - not only in who \"owns\" and \"runs\" the organization, but is the delivery of the program rather standardized (more rigid) or country-specific (more flexible), how can learnings be rolled out and implemented, what are the communication channels/routes, how can potential synergies be identified and used, how does documentation and (impact/performance) reporting happen, etc.\n\nI'll stop my first thoughts here for now - it's already a long piece and I'd be very interested in your feedback.", "created_at": "2020-03-04 10:48:18.797667", "updated_at": "2020-03-04 10:50:43.535503", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1073, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 93.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5547, 6078, 3, 3782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1826, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1793, "post_number": 1, "raw": "LOTE is a community-organized event.

In his book, co-authored with Harvard researchers Robert Faris, and Hal Roberts, \u201cNetwork Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation, and Radicalization in American Politics,\u201d they set out how we shouldn\u2019t blame Facebook for the spread of falsehoods, but right-wing media instead.\n\n\u201c *Most American news outlets try to adhere to facts. When something proves erroneous, they run corrections, or, as Benkler and his co-authors write, \u201cthey check each other.\u201d Far-left Web sites post as many bogus stories as far-right ones do, but mainstream and liberal news organizations tend to ignore suspiciously extreme material.

We really need to create more space for relevant and interesting work at the intersections of culture and technology. Because it helps us understand and process things for which we don't yet have language, or are only beginning to sense.\n\nJannane Al Ani's stunning aerial photos reveal how nothing is truly invisible, even the vanishing of people leaves traces. See for yourself.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/7CP6VG5tdCA\n\nThey are very different but Jannane's presentation and Holly Herndon's video below brought to mind something I have sensed for some time now, but had not yet been able to articulate well. It's related to where we look for clues in trying to understand something complex, and how we go about making sense of it - what activities this entails.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/I_3mCDJ_iWc\n\n \n\nTo me Holly's video manages to communicate on a visceral level the consequences of living under surveillance in a way that no rational arguments ever will. Soon after the event I showed it to retired NSA Technical Director Bill Binney and the ensuing conversation was an interesting one to say the least... but I'm saving it for another post.\n\nIt's something I will be exploring more actively in the new year- how we can encourage and support more of this in the Edgeryders space.  Jeff's post, [Get Back in The Box](), is one example that I have really enjoyed.\n\nPerhaps others in the community might be interested in getting involved in this?  If so the <a href=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aee4f7c8b787f44071202d4979d548f340c28720.jpg\">Making Space</a> group could be a good place to start.", "created_at": "2014-12-09 09:43:40", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 07:35:09.870888", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 495, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 366.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59474, "user_id": 4986, "topic_id": 10804, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Done", "created_at": "2019-09-17 14:08:12.825630", "updated_at": "2019-09-17 14:08:12.825630", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [59473], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60234, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10914, "post_number": 4, "raw": "A question to ask is who is this post for and what is its purpose? \n\nWhile having been immersed in snippets of information, data etc and a general awareness of the issues for over 10 years - I would find seeing them connected in one place is helpful as a shared foundation for a community conversation. What I am looking for is something that connects the dots starting from the climate science pointing to the bad stuff, and where good things are happening (complete with charts and stats) - followed by a birds eye description of what is happening in tech ending with linking the tech, money and politics around would be super helpful. But without having to do a PHD around this topic :) \n\nThis is something I found really powerful from a presentation and fishbowl I attended during techfestival ([notes here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/event-notes-unstructured-tech-moonshot-for-climate-change/10696)). The missing part for me there was the \"where can my small self get in and contribute meaningfully/make the transition in my own life, to contribute to the transition to decarbonisation of economy, society\". As in - a place, a group of people whom I can do this with, resources to support me while I learn skills needed. And some way of figuring out how I am doing while on that journey. Often it can feel like fully internalising all this stuff means throwing yourself off a cliff with no parachute and no landing pad - terrifying.\n\nYes, we do the extinction rebellion marches - but then?

To answer this, we need to look  into how Particip.io fits into Edgeryders as a whole. Famously, Edgeryders is many things, so I can only speak for myself when I describe what we are, but I will try anyway. We are, the way I see it, a distributed tribe. A swarm of people with common values and a sense of community. What makes Edgeryders special is that our tribe crosses borders and cultures in a way that very few networks manage to. We're connected to biohacking labs in California, coffee growers in Nepal, data science researches in France, bureaucrat-hackers in Georgia, ethnographers in Oxford and social entrepreneurs in Kairo. We seek to understand the world, and then act upon that understanding, using innovative online/offline community building and cutting edge digital ethnography tools. We're connecting the dots between people who share a certain mindset and set of values. By growing this swarm, across borders, across cultures, across age-gaps and income-gaps, we want to make it possible for people wherever they are \u2013 be it Medenine or Stockholm \u2013 to feel that their tribe is with them. Personally, and this is where we might have different opinions, I don't engage in this swarm building for humanitarian reasons. By crating this swarm, we are building a future-proof organisation to achieve great things. In a rapidly changing world, we can't know where the opportunities will lie in the future. All we know is that we're likely to need each other more than ever as our global challenges loom larger. That's why I want to engage in collaboration and partnership in places where we're also moving closer to this vision. Placing our hackathon and development week in the OurGhema co-working space in Medenine, where a part of our tribe is located through @yosser, is not only an exciting adventure, but also an investment in the Edgeryders swarm.\n\nWhat is the project we would like to work on? Realities is a software project started by the Borderland, a community which revolves around arranging an annual participatory art and culture and event in Scandinavia. The Borderland is a community that's really pushing the boundaries of how to create meaning in a modern world that to many people feels cold and disconnected. We do this by creating events where people explore and prototype their dreams. Lawyers can be artists. Unemployed people can be leaders. Grandmothers can be DJs. Bankers can be construction workers. Going further, if you want, in a more artistic direction: Dress like a sea-monster for a week, or sit like a prophet under a sign saying \"FREE BAD ADVICE HERE\". For many people, it's rediscovering that through play comes change, and from change comes innovation. Like Edgeryders, the Borderland is a swarm based on participation, but the vibe, method and purpose is very different. In light of this playful vibe, it may be surprising to learn the the Realities software project is a no-nonsense project management tool for decentralised organisations. It's created with the Borderland organisation in mind, but we're building it to be usable for any group or project where nobody is your boss and you are empowered to make decisions after seeking advise from stakeholders. \n\nHow would this work in practice? We'd fly developers and other participants to Medenine. Interested developers and designers from Medenine apply to be a part of the event, this also goes for local developers in Medenine and Tunisia (we will cover travel and accommodation for those who're accepted if they don't live in Medenine). We'd start with a two day hackathon, where we're working on the Realities code based on a set of feature requests made by the Borderland community. During these two days, we're making real contributions to the code but it's also a time for people to learn new technologies and get familiar with the project. In the following week, a smaller group of developers who already know the project and code (so pretty much only those already involved in the project today) stay for a week in Medenine to do paid work on the project. During this time we won't have a lot of time to teach or get people involved, but if there are developers who want to stay and do work with us on a volunteer basis, they are welcome to do so. It should be stressed though that this option is mainly for those who already have some significant experience since it will require working independently most of the time. Developers who choose to stay in Medenine after the hackathon, but who are not included formally in the development week, can still have their accommodation paid for in Medenine during the week. If then are not included and paid for the development week, they don't have to spend all their time working on the Realities project, but can also work independently on their own projects.\n\nAs you can see, it's not a \"hackathon challenge\" in the traditional sense. It's rather a collaborative effort to do work on an existing open source project. But this also teaches a lot of valuable skills of how to get into and contribute to an existing project.\n\nPractically, I also have a few questions for @Yosser  :\n\u2013 Is there fast and reliable wifi? We're working on web development which means we're often downloading packages when we're building software. If the wifi is patchy, is there 4G coverage?\n\u2013 Would you be able to help us find a big house we could rent for the participants? \n\u2013 Are there any Medenine developers on the platform right now?\n\n@brooks, @Forestblessing, @liam, @gustavlrsn, @questioneer, @erikfrisk, input and feedback is more than welcome!", "created_at": "2018-09-15 13:56:09.388265", "updated_at": "2018-09-28 11:27:36.461390", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1041, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 525.8, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5, 4667, 4664, 4, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77176, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 13594, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-05-21 20:35:12.544989", "updated_at": "2020-05-21 20:35:12.544989", "deleted_at": "2020-05-21 20:35:14.880969", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61847, "user_id": 5092, "topic_id": 11207, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Through [Patrick (Sentiers)](https://sentiers.media/) I stumbled upon this [interview with Vaclav Smil](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/vaclav-smil-interview-growth-must-end-economists), expert craftsman of crunching numbers \u2014 I figure there might be people on the platform that have opinions and ideas to share around these ideas?\n\nSmil does a stellar job arguing that degrowth doesn\u2019t necessarily mean *cutting down on all things*  but rather that growth and degrowth are essentially tools to use depending on context. For example, some countries below a certain poverty threshold should focus on growth (towards lower mortality, and increased nutrition and education) while other, richer countries could easily cut down and not miss much at all:\n\n> \u201cOnce you reach a certain point, the benefits of GDP growth start to level off in terms of mortality, nutrition and education. (\u2026) We could halve our energy and material consumption and this would put us back around the level of the 1960s. We could cut down without losing anything important. Life wasn\u2019t horrible in 1960s or 70s Europe. People from Copenhagen would no longer be able to fly to Singapore for a three-day visit, but so what? Not much is going to happen to their lives. People don\u2019t realise how much slack in the system we have.\u201d\n\n> \"To answer this, it\u2019s important not to talk in global terms. There will be many approaches which have to be tailored and targeted to each different audience. There is  **this pernicious idea by this Thomas Friedman guy that the world is flat and everything is now the same, so what works in one place can work for everyone. But that\u2019s totally wrong.**  For example, Denmark has nothing in common with Nigeria. What you do in each place will be different. What we need in Nigeria is more food, more growth. In Philippines we need a little more of it. And in Canada and Sweden, we need less of it. We have to look at it from different points of view.  **In some places we have to foster what economists call de-growth. In other places, we have to foster growth.**\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating debate, and certainly going to be a defining one for our era. The other day, my hairdresser gave me an unprompted lecture on how kerosene prices were too low and need to go up to prevent us from taking short term, long distance travel too often. If that isn\u2019t a sign of this debate entering mainstream then I don\u2019t know what is. *The times they\u2019re a changing.*\n\nSee also this fascinating [XOXO talk by boat-based, ocean-roaming design studio Hundred Rabbits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU) on degrowth and resilience as a personal lifestyle, and how digital tools need to evolve to cope with limited bandwidth, energy and space.", "created_at": "2019-10-21 15:07:57.938887", "updated_at": "2019-10-21 15:07:57.938887", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 480, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 211.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62082, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 11236, "post_number": 3, "raw": "me tooo! looking forward to meeting those I only know virtually :)", "created_at": "2019-10-23 12:40:51.206263", "updated_at": "2019-10-23 12:40:51.206263", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 19.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68516, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8582, "post_number": 118, "raw": "I had missed your contribution, @yudhanjaya!

To make people aware, rather than the technical aspect.\n\n**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**\n\nThat's a good question, probably hasn't happened lately. It's been a while since I felt hopeful. I probably don't remember.\n\nSometimes I feel a little hopeful about tracking. There is a trend towards anonymization, and choice.\n\n**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**\n\nThe top level domain .org was just sold.

Our focus will especially be on organisations and projects related to arts and culture. This project is funded by the Swedish Arts Grants Committee fund Kulturbryggan and marks the first year of development for the Edgeryders Particip.io development lab.\n\n## Goals of Particip.io in 2019\n\n1. **Continue development on existing projects**, document their use cases and tie them together when possible.\n2. **Identify existing open source tools**, define cases for their use, outline what's needed to deploy them and if possible develop ways to tie them together with tools developed as part of Particip.io.\n3. **Research which needs are not being met** and what opportunities exist for developing new tools for participatory organisations and projects working with art and culture.\n4. **Build a community** of software developers, deployment experts, organisational consultants and otherwise savvy people that people and organisations can engage with to get software and methods deployed for their project. This community will live here on the Ederyders platform.\n5. **Present the tools and community** on a front-facing site, [similar to the OpenVillage project](https://edgeryders.eu/c/openvillage), where outcomes are made available.\n\n\n### Existing projects that will be part of Particip.io\n\nSome ongoing projects will be included in Particip.io and the goal is to develop these to a state where they can be readily deployed with ease. [Dreams, a platform to plan and distribute funds to projects at co-created events](http://dreams.theborderland.se/), will be developed to a state where it will be possible to use it for events without having access to a developer for setup and maintenance, and hosted as a service. It's currently at a reasonably mature stage of development and has been used in production at multiple events over the last few years. Much of the development has been done by @Forestblessing , who is a founding partner of the Particip.io project who will also work on Dreams and coordinate development with the existing community tied to that platform. [Realities, a platform to manage and visualise needs and responsibilities in a decentralised organisation](https://github.com/theborderland/realities), will be developed to state where it can be deployed in production for the Borderland, a participatory event and collaborative community in Scandinavia. Two developers who have worked on Realities before will join the Particip.io project \u2013 Erik Frisk and @lowlandjuju \n\n### Identify existing tools and find new use cases\n\nMany tools exist that could fit into the frame, and other tools that have not traditionally been used for organisations in culture and arts could be used in new ways. One example is to see how the Edgeryders SSNA software could be used in a creative process or as a dynamic project management tool for very open ended projects. Other software that can be explored are projects like [Autopo](https://app.autopo.co/), [Loomio](http://loomio.com/) and [Discourse](https://discourse.org/).\n\n### Research new frontiers\n\nIn addition to working on existing projects, the Particip.io community will dream up, prototype and perhaps develop and deploy other platforms and tools for participatory art and culture. Our primary goal with these explorations is to push the boundaries of how we collaborate and dream together, and a secondary goal is to bring ideas to life that could spinn off into projects that could secure additional funding for the Particip.io community. @nadia will be involved in this part of the project, focusing on exploring what directions it could take.\n\n### Building a community\n\nOnce we're up and running, and have a community of people with experience and intelligence about what exists and how it can be implemented, organisations can post in this workspace to get in touch with people who could help them implement these solutions for their projects.\n\n### Presenting the results\n\nA deliverable for the funders is that we need to present the results on a website, which will outline our findings and direct people to the workspace to learn more.\n\n## How to get involved\n\nWork on Particip.io will be done in four different forms:\n\n1. Open freelance development\n2. Exploratory hackathons\n3. Focused development weeks\n4. Distributed team development cycle\n5. Independent paid freelance development\n\n### Open freelance development\nYou are more than welcome to contribute to the codebase and start working on an issue whenever you want to. You'll be joining the Particip.io community, and developers who make consistent contributions may be invited to join for a hackathon or  a focused development week or allotted paid hours to do more focused long term work.\n\n### Exploratory hackathons\nA total of three hackathons will be held in 2019. These will be 4 days long, with 8-12 participants. Travel, food and accommodation will be paid for by the project. Each of these hackathons will focus on exploring and prototyping solutions to specific problems collected from participants on the ER platform. Participants in the hackathons are developers, designers, artists and visionaries. Hackathon participants do not need to be professionals, and it's preferable to have a mix of people from different background. One hackathon will be hosted by Matt Parsons outside of Malm\u00f6, another will be held at Tivedstorp outside of Lax\u00e5 and the location of the third hackathon is yet to be decided.\n\n### Focused development sprint week\nMuch of the hands on development of the projects will happen during focused work weeks, where 2-4 developers and designers meet somewhere to design and code functional prototypes or new releases of some Particip.io project. Travel and accommodation is provided by the project, and each participant is also payed 1000 EUR for the week. In 2019, we will host at least 5 of these development weeks in locations decided on by the participants. Participants in these development weeks should be skilled developers or designers.\n\n### Distributed team development cycle\nIn cases where clear specifications and deliverables have already been decided upon for a project, work can be done in team sprints, where 2-4 developers work together remotely for a few weeks while working on the project for some of their available time. These are different from focused development weeks in that they happen remotely and can be mixed with other work. Payment model can vary based on scope, but a rule of thumb is that the scope and pay is similar to a sprint week on site, but done over a month. Participants should be skilled developers or designer with experience of the code base being worked on.\n\n### Paid freelance development\nWe have a total of 240 hours of freelance developer hours available. These hours will only be used by developers have participated in active development, have already contributed quality controlled additions to the code base of a project and want to spend freelance time on developing features or fixing bugs and issues.\n\n\n## When does work start?\n\nWe start gearing up in October, and most of the work will be done in 2019. However, one project is already rolling, which is to get the Realities project to a place where it's understandable and stable enough to be able to bring a new community of developers in to work on the project. Erik Frisk, who has worked on that project before, has been given two initial weeks of remote work to do this.", "created_at": "2018-09-04 19:22:16.605474", "updated_at": "2018-10-16 20:59:25.902611", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1234, "wiki": false, "reads": 57, "score": 566.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4566, 4209, 4451, 4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67405, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 2, "raw": "![LR%20House%20Tarp%20dec%202019|690x388](upload://b5iitM5LMAu4IRIGXlHaSYWAfBi.jpeg) \n\nThis is my house on the Mendocino coast of northern California a few hours north of San Francisco.

No matter if you participated or not, tell us: how do you think the questions below can be answered? Let's figure it out together.*\n \n@Nadia: I come from a farming family in an isolated part of Sudan. There I saw that there\u2019s a need to be connected with others, through social relations. I would like to understand what it\u2019s like in Europe.\n\nMarcello: Professor at Univ of Cassino, teacher of entrepreneurship and rural development. Focuses on localised rural ecosystem and entrepreneurial attitude - how to make the rural viable. How to make viable rural areas means to take into account the different rural areas, we cannot speak about just one type of area, but we can also think of rural peri urban and rural remote.\n\nChristiana: In Southern Greece nearby Sparta. *I want to prototype a village that gathers data about ESG (to help ESG managers) to revitalise the village and attract people in entrepreneurship with bioeconomy - this is what Meraki people is all about. [Video intro.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvfHdgtcnqI \u03a4\u03bf \u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1)*\n\n@Emblotka123 (Adria) member in [food cooperative in Warsaw](https://www.dobrze.waw.pl/english/). Started because she wanted to have access to quality food. Has plans to move to a rural area, with other people, become farmers and show people that there are alternatives to living in cities and it is possible to earn money as a farmer. \u2018The problem in Poland is that we don't have good education when it comes to agriculture, so people who want to be small farmers don't have good knowledge. In university what is taught is only for big scale agriculture.\u2019\n\n@irene_1: Phd student and since 5 years grew interest in herbology and the production of herbal plants. Based in Brussels. There is a lot going on in urban agriculture, but feels that having this double personality as a service/ knowledge worker and a second life of having your hands in the ground is not very easy to do. \u2018At some point I feel I should choose between the two careers\u2019, but it is hard to see how groups of people are forming and having a conscience.\n\n@aleks.jaszczyk: in Poland, in a rural area and community called Kooperatywa Izerska. In this area there is a lot of new immigration from the cities, because the land for the past years was quite cheap to buy. There was this fashion to have an old style house in the rural areas. It goes with food sovereignty movement and trying to keep the quality of food in this area, keeping the seeds, and setting up a food bank.\n\n@Dragan_Jonic: involved in ecological activism, which is connected with food development. Lives in Belgrade, and for a long time was involved in a community garden. Reading that there are no smallholder farmers in the US, everyone is involved in big agri, and he realised that Europe is a completely different world.\n\n@thom_stewart: manages a coop with people with mental health difficulties - service design for Irish Health services. The community has tried to develop an ecologically regenerative Community Land Trust. We have agreement for 2 sites - in the middle of Ireland for an ecological community and another urban site. We are doing a baseline study for biodiversity, carbon, water drainage etc for the 30 acre site.\n\n@Alessandro: grew up in Tuscany, in the countryside. 'I knew nothing else than people doing their own farming, going hunting. The pullback to that kind of life is a lifestyle choice, the real focal point for me is the need for a tight community around your family. I'm trying to create this communal experiences in Armenia.'\n\nRobert: President of Polish Climate Forum. 'We did absolutely everything necessary to stop climate change. We promote permaculture gardens and try to build a clusterised society of people who grow/buy their own food relatively cheaply and easily'\n\n@federico_monaco: sociologist and researcher at Uni of Parma. Moved from the capital because he felt that moving to a smaller city was the way to be closer to nature. 'It's hard to explain to people that there is a connection between food and where it is produced. We need new words, new idioms to be spoken to get people to get new categories to face this. With a small movement here, we are trying to feed ourselves in the context of urban culture. It's hard to change the way people think. People think 'when I buy organic it costs more than in the supermarket''\n\n@Slow_Karolina: Living in Poland, PhD in Krakow, writing a low key study on food sovereignty! Before, she was working in International law, and now in food law. Supporting international producers (from Sicily) to import them to Poland. I'm interested in finding solutions for organic farmers.\n\n### 1. When you talk to economists, a most difficult thing is that the experiences of ecovillages is that the core business is not food production, but maybe that and other things, like research, or community cooperatives, or charities. Is it true that we can produce food, but not make it our whole business?\n\n@johncoate: If you have to sell directly everything you are producing, then you have a serious challenge. Some of it can be simply teaching people to do things.\nJasen: I wouldn\u2019t personally rely only on agriculture, climate changes and there is instability. I believe in flexibility. But I know many people around the world who are only doing farming, but they are also innovative, they use some automation, or produce high margin goods etc.\n\n@FrankDieters: In the Netherlands, we try to reconnect agriculture with new rural areas and populations - you have a city with the immediate rural area next to it. We see that the city completely turns its back to rural areas, which creates a divide. You indeed have to look further than the just agriculture business, you have to revitalise the whole community, reconstruct relationships in those communities, and then you can have a viable, more local economic system. Are there crossovers in business models and empowering a community to work together i.e. agricultors and people who work in cities, but live rural?\n\n### 2. How viable is rural life and especially re-urbanisation? And what kind of effects can it bring?\n\nMarcello: Rural entrepreneurship and community initiatives are important also for countries in development, not only in the West.\n\nFrank Dieters: The rural areas are so much more than just a place where our food comes from. It is the rural areas that are essential for our climate adaptation, our health (recreational), watersystems, biosystems, etc. There are those challenges that tie the different worlds together.\n\n### 3. Do you think that the rural policy plays a role in that? How to become aware that a policy provision is available? Are we sure that these policies are targeting people who really need it?\n\nThom: My principal interests in re-rurbanization are a: epidemiological risk and b: personal experience of improved mental health from living rurally. Noemi: this is so underrated and invisible when you're in the rabbit wheel, or what it's called\n\nJohn Coate: I moved from urban to rural, but made sure there was broadband to the house. Without it, it won\u2019t work.\n\nThom Stewart: I'm curious around quantification of those benefits. Metrics on the co-benefits of health/carbon/biodiversity of regenerative agricultural approaches, along with more conventional community economic indicators\n\nAngelo: the rural policy is intended to be part of a farming policy. Farmers think that it is for them, but it should be multifunctional, because it\u2019s a territorial approach. You are operating on space, maps, not sectors. So the farming policy is not rural enough, in my view.\n\nFrank Dieters: Agree, but there are possibilities. You have the Interreg projects, and the [Leader projects](http://www.leaderzuidlimburg.nl/projecten).\n\nJasen: I worked for years in rural development, mostly in LEADER and regional development related funds. I did help a few organisations with a social cohesion fund as well. In Croatia we are fully focused on revitalising rural areas by giving all info to rural dwellers and by functioning specifically in rural areas only. Nobody focuses on attracting urban dwellers TO rural areas with programs in cities or workshops to actually show the potential to the urban dwellers as well. The issue there is, after a certain point, the emigration from a community cannot be reversed because the critical mass of human potential is no longer there.\n\nDragan M. Joni\u0107: I see the question about the viability of rural life only now. IMO, it includes telling people blandly they\u2019re fried if they go on living in big cities where you can cut the air in cubes.\n\n### 4. How to go about building a rural community and what attracts people to it?\n\nComing up! A separate conversation with @aleks.jaszczyk\n###  5. Broadband as a human right, like water. Are there programs and workshops in cities to attract people? We talked about the need for broadband, but also cultural activities and infrastructure.\n\nIrene: I would have liked to contribute more on ideas of hybridity of urban-rural and how seasonal work and public urban policy on food sovereignty could try and reconcile the two, I will follow up on the platform! cheers everyone and thanks for the session!\n\nJasen : alright, i would gladly push for that in Croatia if there are some good practices\n\nNoemi: But how is this different than digitized ecovillages? It's just on a larger scale?\n\n@aleks.jaszczyk: I would also hear about this migrating to rural workshops more :D We have reasonable positive remains from comunist times: allotment gardens in larger cities, there are workshops on how to manage such a garden ecologically, probably maybe indirectly convincing people that they would like more of their land.\n\nThom Stewart : Notable that CloughJordan is within a preexisting village - infrastructure in place - as opposed to truly rural\n\nNoemi : I'm not sure it's about money - for many my generation : it's emancipation values, what we associate with culture and intellect. That's a major roadblock to deciding to move out of the city.\n\n@Dragan_Jonic to @jasen_lakic increasing number of people are realising that, in Serbia. We\u2019ve recently had a spike in prices of rural/peri-urban properties. It will be interesting to see how it unrolls. Most of them are mimicking the suburban way of life. But if at least 10% of them start gardening, that\u2019s quite a lot.\n\n@johncoate: also maybe fewer manufacturing jobs in the city now. certainly true for the USA.\n\nJasen : I expect a lot of bankruptcies in Croatia as of next year and people moving back to rural as well, due to lower living cost/higher self reliance\n\nAle: I would say what Robert is saying- it is also a bit more dispersed sprawling city - making more chaos in the suburban space without managing land in a sustainable way.", "created_at": "2020-11-30 14:09:44.361463", "updated_at": "2020-11-30 14:31:47.899428", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1885, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 218.4, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3677, 8, 3067, 5, 3310, 6964], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78333, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13472, "post_number": 3, "raw": "add it!", "created_at": "2020-06-05 08:28:46.465385", "updated_at": "2020-06-05 08:28:46.465385", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [78328], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77089, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13595, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Works for me, but if people are indifferent I would do it California-friendly.", "created_at": "2020-05-20 16:31:46.184749", "updated_at": "2020-05-20 16:31:46.184749", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 12.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [77088], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34791, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6806, "post_number": 1, "raw": "_If we each take a few minutes to do a few things ahead of each [OpenVillage Workshop](http://openvillage.edgeryders.eu/workshop/), we will help to ensure the experience is meaningful and generative for everyone involved!

I'm intrigued by this duality of production and reproduction, and I wonder if this needs to be updated to a more ecological mindset. Maybe we no longer need quite so much to either produce and reproduce, but to restore and nurture. The reaction of the Left to the collapsing 'house of cards' of financial markets is to assert that we need to 'get back to making things', and that thinking often goes hand in hand with a fairly traditional idea of a separation of work from home. The workplace is the place where things are made. The home is where people recuperate from and prepare for work. Work is dominant. The worker is more valued. The crucial question now about making things is 'how can we make things in a way that restores the biosphere and generates biosphere capital?' My hunch is that part of this answer is by making home a workplace, making work more relevant to where and how we live in ecosystems and making home a place for children to learn how to do this work. Dougald Hine had a brainwave response to Illich's call to 'deschool society' by renaming it 'rehoming society'. I'd go along with that.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-05 08:58:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:31.351619", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 218, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70453, "user_id": 4711, "topic_id": 12650, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hello, I am Ichraf Jarray, a computer engineer, social activist, and founder of Hive 12 Coworking Space, one of the first collaborative Coworking spaces in Sousse.\n\nIn collaboration with OCI LAB, Hive12  hosted in 17th of February, 2020  a Webinar untitled Power Pitch & Storytelling with Matteo Uguzzoni \n\nOut of a total of 39 people, only 24 attended the Webinar, including 14 women and ten men coming from different backgrounds ( students, entrepreneurs, freelancers, and even teachers as well as professionals ).

If necessary I can do a lot of my work from home but I also know that there are some things I need workshops, facilities or just colleagues for, which is one of the reasons I have my studio at Blivande. After a workshop I was supposed to facilitate this week was postponed it is relatively simple and straightforward for me to work from home.\n\nMy husband's company sent him and everyone else into the home office for the next 2 weeks. \n\nI have to admit, we partially enjoy being together the whole day :). \n\nI have only worked in a classical \u201coffice\u201d for just under a year and right now I find it fascinating to learn more about my husband's usual work process and how they deal with the sudden shift. I am curious to find out what is \u201cnormally\u201d happening in a \u201cnormal\u201d office, which of course does not exist. \n\nDuring my own \u201coffice experience\u201d the company had a very strict \u201csave the flow\u201d policy. Meaning that nobody was supposed to just talk to each other but rather to converse via Trello cards even when sitting next to each other and book times for conversations only if absolutely necessary. I have to say that that was a work atmosphere which did not work for me personally. One of the reasons I am going to co-working spaces is to be able to sometimes just talk about what I am working on and I am open to listen and comment on others projects as well since it helps me think and I want to help them as well. Sure, flow is a great state, but I think it can not be forced and you should not be alone in it too long. \n\n*So how is my husband working?* \nThe second day of homeoffice he said \u201cI am bored!\u201d I asked if he was more bored than he would be at work and he said \u201cYes! because I can not talk.\u201d I offered that we could talk, and we certainly do, but he specified \u201cI want to work and talk about work. A big part of my work is to talk. To come by each other and quickly discuss something or so and I think that is one of the reasons my team functions\u201d. We are now actively thinking about how to improve this situation. If possible we try to be there as sounding boards for each other if we just quickly have to articulate something to think it through for ourselves properly. We will also invite one of his colleagues over to our place for a day for them to be able to work together and discuss intensively for one day and move on. Let\u2019s see how this develops throughout the weeks.\n\n*What did it make me think?*\nThe conversation is an important part of the thinking and working process for many people. How can we archive it in remote collaboration situations? I would propose to not shy away too much to discuss thoughts and developments with other people who are not strictly in your team but whom you trust and give back the favour by listening to them. I think this is not wasting time, but improving the quality and atmosphere of your work.\n\nThis thought will influence how I plan my work and how I will think about developing our distributed work projects further.", "created_at": "2020-03-16 14:26:40.493632", "updated_at": "2020-03-16 14:28:53.753479", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 609, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 43.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62839, "user_id": 2567, "topic_id": 11296, "post_number": 8, "raw": "12th evening yes.

The research network core: @marina and @alberto (with my RezNet hat)\n\nH2020 projects differ from other Edgeryders projects in many ways. One of the most confusing is that, by definition, we cannot deliver them alone. We participate in consortia, and need to work with consortium partners. This puts us all in contact not only with the organizational issues of Edgeryders (inertia, lossy communication, imperfect foresight, clunky processes etc.), but with those of all other partners in the consortium as well. This is inevitable. \n\nTo make the situation workable, we at the RezNet did quite some work with team leaders in the proposal writing phase and then again in the grant agreement negotiation phase. This was to make sure team leaders had a structure of the work we could work with (example: no key inputs depending on other partners, that might not deliver) and adequate resources. But, as with all human things, that is an imperfect process. Now, in the implementation phase, there will be remaining issues. \n\nThe message is this: **team leaders are responsible for dealing with those issues**. Please, resist the temptation to think \"oh, somebody must know how I should do this, I am going to ask around\". As so often in Edgeryders, there is no higher authority with The Plan. You are it. Examples include:\n\n* **You would like to organize a training and event in coordination with the event already organized with another partner**. Reach out to the partner in question, and discuss it with them. Do not ask Marina or myself to ask them, or organize a call with them. Any time you can cut out the middlemen, do it. \n* **You are supposed to hire people to do some work, but you are unsure of how many, for how long etc.** The Descriptions of the actions are your friends here. They are attachments to the Grant Agreements, which you can easily find in the Team Drives of the respective projects. They contain authoritative budgets and work plans \u2013 we are answerable for those to the Commission. We also have more detailed internal budgets, that were discussed with all of you during proposal and negotiation: [POPREBEL](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17acou-OC8lWVuhU33yZykrkU4IA2BOdKS3Do8m91nOg), [NGI Forward](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12dmScDls52JBzqd7RIYLL0_wslZF-cUpMYvLUyqplU0) (these links are only accessible to authorized users). Read the documents, a lot of info is there. Again, you might need to coordinate with other partners; and again, please reach out to them directly.\n* **You do not know how to do admin stuff** (contracts, timesheets etc.). Online documentation and templates (for example for contracts) are there for most issues. If they do not solve your problem, of course, do ask for help!

But, in general, it seems to me that there is no one-to-one correspondence between a space and a way of life. I live in Brussels, where you have about one third Belgians, one third European migrants, such as myself, and one-third non-European migrants, mostly from Morocco, Turkey and Congo (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels#Nationalities). If any one group pushes too hard to enforce its way of life, the city will become unlivable. And then, it's not like there is one way of life, even within the same group. Italians and Danes are both Europeans, but they do not necessarily live in the same way. Belgians are themselves split across the Wallonian/Flemish linguistic and cultural line. And Moroccans and Congolese... you get the idea.\n\nLow-diversity neighborhoods such as Molenbeek (where it can happen to a random woman to be scolded because no hijab) are seen as brewing trouble. I do not know enough to take a position myself, but [this post](http://www.politico.eu/article/molenbeek-broke-my-heart-radicalization-suburb-brussels-gentrification/) made the rounds in late 2015. It made me think a lot. \n\nAdditionally, low local diversity does not mean lack of oppression. In Tunisia after the revolution, for example, there was a big political fight on the political rights of women. Both the progressive and the conservative religious side of the argument claimed to speak in the name of the same Arab and Muslim tradition. The culture was homogenous, but at least some people did not feel they were getting a completely fair deal _from the people sharing their same culture_.\n\nThe usual way to get out of this complexity is, in the West, human rights. This is a legal culture that says: the rights of individuals supersede the rights of groups. It's historically kind of new \u2013 individuals have been seen as expendable for most of human history \u2013 and not everybody buys into it, not even in Europe (its birthplace). \n\nIf I am completely off the mark, just ignore me :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2017-09-18 17:09:50.999904", "updated_at": "2017-09-18 17:09:50.999904", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 358, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 45.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [36543], "is_liked_by": [2580, 3769], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55829, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10244, "post_number": 5, "raw": "It's good, I just finished.
