It came up to us through some interviews we and friends conducted in the last weeks with refugees or other newcomers in Berlin. What are your thoughts on this?\nTo make it easier for everyone interested to follow I will try to sum up the thoughts we had and the experiences we made recently.\nStarting with the question \u201cHow can food help people on the move to feel at home wherever they are at the moment?\u201d amongst others we got to talk to a 24 year old guy from Syria and a girl from Korea about the same age. One had to flee home and the other moved for love.\nSome of the most remarkable insights we got are about food some are not. Two I want to share because they add to our design question.\nThe guy misses the Syrian nights where as he tells everyone takes their coaches and pillows outside, drinks tea, smokes, chats and just sleeps on the streets. Maybe this does not happen in big towns he says but in villages as in smaller or medium-sized towns it does.\nThe girl told us that she is missing the Korean street food a lot. Once she tried out a Korean street food market here in Berlin, but did not like it. She went there with some friends, to chat, meet new people and have some good Korean food but it ended up being too expensive, there was even an entrance fee and the food was just not good. In Korea she always used to eat outside with her friends. Cooking was a family thing; eating out was for all other social events.\nAfter those interviews we talked about the \u201cBerlin Thaipark\u201d, were mostly Thai women sell homemade southeast Asian dishes on their blankets more or less being tolerated by the bureaucracy; about a great project by the New York based designer Candy Chang called Street vendor guide where she visualizes the most commonly violated rules in this context for the vendors themselves; and asked ourselves: How can we enable migrants to integrate the interactive food customs / traditions they like and bring from their culture of origin into Berlins community life?\nLater on one of our fellow students told us the following:\nA group of Syrian refugees mentioned the huge summer barbecues they would always have in summertime back in Syria: a lot of friends, family, a lot of food, somewhere in the nature, in a park. When being asked if they are doing similar activities here in summertime they deny. They think that it is forbidden to have a barbecue anywhere outside and do not want to act against the law seen their uncertain status. Still they miss them.\nThat basically is how we ended up facing the design question already mentioned above: How can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extent, because they do not know what activities are legal in these spaces and are afraid to act against the law?\nSo far we, a group of 4 university students, call our little project A Taste of Home and would be more than happy about any comments.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 22:31:52", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 22:31:52", "tag_id": 1395, "post_id": 683, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 650}, {"id": 22965, "text": "", "quote": "I'm 72 but a consultant and I work on projects I love but not fulltime.

Pre-welfare states (19th century), welfare was basically invented by European mutual assistance societies, in turn part of the workers' movement. I imagine that, in the early days, these societies were small enough that the choice of treating someone would visibily drain the common pool of resources. So, in those days, maybe European factory workers thought a bit more like the Amish. A modern-day version of that, though I only know anecdotes about it, is implemented by @lasindias .\u00a0\nI think autonomy\u00a0is also an interesting scenario in terms of policy, and fits well into @Lakomaa 's and @Tino_Sanandaji 's institutional economics framework.\u00a0\nMy summary from the article:\u00a0\n\nThe Amish refuse to have insurance. \"When someone gets sick, the church collects alms to help the patient cover expenses.\"\nThis might happen at a time when the community has other objectives as well (\"setting up a farm for a young couple\"). You can ask of the community to support your treatment, but its\u00a0costs are not simply discharged into an anonymous \"system\": they are borne by your own brothers and sisters. As a result, everyone focuses on not spending more money than is necessary, and\u00a0\"[Amish] communities are highly interested in health education and disease prevention\".\nFor this reason, the Amish use genetic screening of children. Prevention is so important that its benefits trump the disadvantages of dealing with the world at large.\nThey develop their own treatments (one for burns is described in the article). They navigate, with some difficulties, the interface with the mainstream medical world: clinical testing etc. These treatments tend to be very cheap.\u00a0\nCommunities negotiate discounts, which hospitals are willing to offer in exchange for payment in full at the time of service. In one example (a child treated with surgery for colon cancer) price was negotiated down to 19,000 USD from 172,000, a 90% discount. \"For Americans with health insurance, it may come as a surprise that hospital costs are negotiable\".\u00a0\nThe Amish don't sue. \"When the Amish told [a doctor]\u00a0they understand doctors are human and make mistakes, he had to pause to let that sink in. To them, he was not simply a member of the medical establishment, but an autonomous individual doing his best, given the choices and information before him.\"", "created_at": "2017-01-06 14:29:12", "updated_at": "2017-01-06 14:29:12", "tag_id": 80, "post_id": 14083, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 680}, {"id": 23189, "text": "", "quote": "Yes, the statement is too easy in its generalization, but its a good discussion-opener (like: why is that service for free?).

It is estimated that worldwide over 508,000 women died in 2011 from breast cancer (Global Health Estimates, WHO 2013). This represents about 12% of all new cancer cases and 25% of all cancers in women.\nIn all countries, early detection remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control in order to improve breast cancer outcome and survival. In health systems with developed infrastructure, physicians regularly examine the breast as part of a routine female check-up (usually once or twice a year) in addition to mammography. However, this routine procedure is \u00a0provided at varying levels of time investment and care.\nDiscovering hands has a number of advantages:\nBy using the extraordinary sensory capabilities of visually impaired women, a perceived \u201cdisability\u201d is transformed into a capability. A completely new field of meaningful employment is created.\n\u201cMedical Tactile Examiners\u201d (MTEs) are trained to deliver physical breast examinations at doctors\u2019 practices. During a 9-month training period they learn how to use a standardized diagnostic method for examining the female breast. Additionally, all MTEs are trained in communication skills and breast-specific psychology, as well as administrative tasks typically carried out by a doctor\u2019s assistant. MTEs are either directly employed by resident doctors or hospitals, or they work for different practices and/or hospitals on a freelance basis.\nConventionally, a regular breast examination carried out by a gynecologist takes between 1 and 3 minutes. The discovering hands MTE invests at least 30 minutes for each session, not only examining the breast, but also educating patients on how to cope with the risk of breast cancer. Patients feel that they are well taken care of and receive the best possible preventive examination in a pleasant environment.\nPreliminary qualitative results, conducted by the University of Essen, show that MTEs detect ~50% more and ~28% smaller tissue alterations in the breast than doctors (5-8mm vs. 10-15mm). A clinical, peer reviewed study is currently being conducted at the University of Erlangen.\nOur vision\nWe are operating as a social business because we believe in the our value proposition (to the healthcare sector, and institutions supporting people with disabilities). We are committed to the social \"win-win\" of our model: offering meaningful employment to blind women, and creating an opportunity for them where they have competitive strength; and helping to improve the breast cancer early identification situation and awareness for the most common cancer among women.\nCurrent roll-out\nDiscovering hands is planning to substantially increase the number of MTEs in the years to come. We currently operate in Germany and in Austria. In both India and Colombia we have pilot projects running with scale-up in planning. And we are interested in further country roll-out, which we operate through a social franchise.\nIf you are a social entrepreneur and would like to implement discovering hands in your country, contact us. Also, if you are an impact investor and are interested in collaborating with us to further roll-out the model, please contact us too.

Yet, the relationship between the utility (U) consumers gain and the data (D) they supply \u2014 \u201creturn on data\u201d (ROD) \u2014 remains largely unexplored. Expressed as a ratio, ROD = U / D. While lawmakers strongly advocate protecting consumer privacy, they tend to overlook ROD. Are the benefits of the services enjoyed by consumers, such as social networking and predictive search, commensurate with the value of the data extracted from them? How can consumers compare competing data-for-services deals? Currently, the legal frameworks regulating these transactions, including privacy law, aim primarily to protect personal data. They treat data protection as a standalone issue, distinct from the benefits which consumers receive. This article suggests that privacy concerns should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of ROD. Just as companies can quantify return on investment (ROI) to optimize investment decisions, consumers should be able to assess ROD in order to better spend and invest personal data. Making data-for-services transactions more transparent will enable consumers to evaluate the merits of these deals, negotiate their terms and make more informed decisions. Pivoting from the privacy paradigm to ROD will both incentivize data-driven service providers to offer consumers higher ROD, as well as create opportunities for new market entrants.\"\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n            \n            \n            \n                personal data\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                trade-off\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                usefulness\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                business model\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                privacy\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                \"return on data\"\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                digital services\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                attributing value\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                information quality\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                decision-making\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                contextualisation\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                informed choices\n            \n        \n        \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2020-09-03 10:25:04.290831", "updated_at": "2020-09-03 10:25:04.290831", "tag_id": 7325, "post_id": 55206, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9821}, {"id": 23201, "text": "", "quote": "I would much prefer for Facebook to be a subscription service where I pay them directly and they in turn treat me like I am the customer.

Yet, the relationship between the utility (U) consumers gain and the data (D) they supply \u2014 \u201creturn on data\u201d (ROD) \u2014 remains largely unexplored. Expressed as a ratio, ROD = U / D. While lawmakers strongly advocate protecting consumer privacy, they tend to overlook ROD. Are the benefits of the services enjoyed by consumers, such as social networking and predictive search, commensurate with the value of the data extracted from them? How can consumers compare competing data-for-services deals? Currently, the legal frameworks regulating these transactions, including privacy law, aim primarily to protect personal data. They treat data protection as a standalone issue, distinct from the benefits which consumers receive. This article suggests that privacy concerns should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of ROD. Just as companies can quantify return on investment (ROI) to optimize investment decisions, consumers should be able to assess ROD in order to better spend and invest personal data. Making data-for-services transactions more transparent will enable consumers to evaluate the merits of these deals, negotiate their terms and make more informed decisions. Pivoting from the privacy paradigm to ROD will both incentivize data-driven service providers to offer consumers higher ROD, as well as create opportunities for new market entrants.\"\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commenttrade-off\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentusefulness\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentbusiness model\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentprivacy\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Comment\"return on data\"\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentdigital services\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentattributing value\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentinformation quality\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentdecision-making\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentcontextualisation\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentinformed choices\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentpersonal data\n\n  \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n            \n            \n            \n                return on investment (ROI)\n            \n        \n        \n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2020-09-03 10:30:16.076795", "updated_at": "2020-09-03 10:30:16.076795", "tag_id": 7339, "post_id": 55206, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9821}, {"id": 23428, "text": "", "quote": "Obfuscating to mess with ads? https://m.slashdot.org/story/357538\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n            \n            \n            \n                disruption\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                advertising\n            \n        \n            \n            \n                hacks\n            \n        \n        \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2020-09-03 10:30:31.976726", "updated_at": "2020-09-03 10:30:31.976726", "tag_id": 3821, "post_id": 55780, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9821}, {"id": 23438, "text": "", "quote": "Google moves towards implmenting a plugin/extension API to prevent ad-blockers to be effective in Chrome.Mozilla seems to fight back. https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/09/03/mozillas-manifest-v3-faq/", "created_at": "2020-09-03 10:31:28.301829", "updated_at": "2020-09-03 10:31:28.301829", "tag_id": 7341, "post_id": 58801, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9821}, {"id": 23343, "text": "", "quote": "I have been thinking for a couple of year about a way that the ad business, and revenue models for content production and curation needs to change.

I think the 'home bubbles' and the 'abroad bubbles' have always been fluid for me - 'home' and 'abroad' have blurry boundaries. Even in my darkest, least hopeful moments, when it felt like I didn't have a home anymore or a language that feels like home, I tried to remind myself that I left Romania for NYC because I was curious to learn about the world. This is also the reason for which I try to keep my bubbles porous - I believe that if I want to learn with others I cannot live in the comfort of a cozy space. My struggle has been to deconstruct ideas that society takes for granted - that 'home' needs to be a stable space, a comfortable one, a space of predictability and intimacy (hence my interest in co-housing). But most homes are not like that or, more accurately, they are like that only in the simplified narratives we create about them. From my experience, there is a lot of hard work involved in building a home both 'at home' and 'abroad'. So, it is this hard work of making a home that keeps me sane because I know that, if I am honest with myself, wherever I go I will have to engage in it. This realization has saved me from cultural shocks and the disappointment with old or new friends. Of course, some days it feels easier to fall back on given narratives about homes and homelands...but those days pass. More difficult is losing friends because of such relocations in space but then again friendships are dialogues and some dialogues end or morph into something else. I guess, I find my wellbeing in trying to stay curious, kind and open to the world around me even when I don't feel like it or when the world around doesn't seem particularly kind to me (poetry helps too) :)\n        \n  \n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentleaving comfort zone\n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentcuriosity\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2019-11-15 17:03:56.204679", "updated_at": "2020-09-03 15:09:58.052155", "tag_id": 5522, "post_id": 64081, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9369}, {"id": 23519, "text": "", "quote": "n my case staying in country in which you feel \"outsider\" and you are litterally called \"thread to healthy nation\" - hmm, seems a little masochistic", "created_at": "2020-09-03 15:16:08.098807", "updated_at": "2020-09-03 15:16:14.090717", "tag_id": 5164, "post_id": 57876, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9369}, {"id": 23520, "text": "", "quote": "that associates \"nations\" and groups that don't feel represented in their countries or internationally while considering the complexity of these entities, their stories, needs, and desires.

And at the same time, it's nice to play with the physical. So to make the world a reflection of our spiritual growth. To let both go hand in hand. To grow and deepen the quality of relationships and communities. To develop the society and create things that represent our love for the world and the mystery of creation.
