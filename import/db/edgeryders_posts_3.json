They have finally decided to move forward and get a bit more funding and work closely on supporting art run initiatives and spaces. \n\nThe partners included the impressive Free Riga movement that successfully occupies abandoned spaces in the city and gives them for use to creative and not-so-creative entities. In fact, the meeting happened in [one of the sites](https://freeriga.lv/M34T10/) they manage, and it was indeed a beautiful industrial space with mix use - an impressive bar with a concert hall, offices, art residencies and what not - you can see in the link, it's massive. Riga is this incredible city with a lot of empty space - it was built for 2 million people, and its 1mln population from the beginning of 90-ties has declined to less than 700.000 and it doesn't seem to restore. There are some rich people buying properties in the city (Russians for example), but the population is not changing drastically. It was very funny to discuss gentrification with Kurts, who runs this particular space, because to him many things I and an artist from Denmark painted as maladies of late capitalism, he really wished to see in Riga. \n\nAnyway, the rest of the partners are Candyland, Ormston House, The Artist-Run Alliance, LTMKS 17, Top e. V., Syndicate of Creatures, The Alternative Art Guide, Konstfack Totaldobre and Aarhus Center for Visual Art / Juxtapose Art Fair. \n\nWhat became clear very soon was that the application is going to be: too little money (200.000), too many organizations, and most of them Nordic, which means expensive, and too many ideas partners want to realize. I pointed this out and the next day a lot of the content was already scrapped, but it still remained extremely optimistic. Another problem was that the person that invited me to this meeting as a possible partner didn't really support my ideas and input in this application, even though Edgeryders would be a great fit if at least part of the focus was on community building, with a purpose of exchange, p2p learning, and archive of practices, history, and experiences of artist-run spaces and initiatives. And that was meant to be one of the pivotal aspects of this application. \n\nAnyway, I will be around the group for a while and see what comes out of it - I certainly met some people who might become valuable collaborators in the future.

The proper restriction must only be sustainability -- don't make assumptions about whether growth is \"good\" or \"bad\" in advance -- growth can occur in many ways, some do not negatively impact the economy but others do.\n\nIt is well known among economists and demographers that economic growth (above a certain level) does two things: first and most surely, it leads to a reduction in fertility. High fertility correlates with sustainable agriculture, as more babies lead to higher household production as they grow older than six and can work in the fields. IF education rises, AND if women are educated, AND if women are allowed to take jobs, then the opportunity cost of having a child rises and fertility falls. This happens regardless of availability of birth control, but is accelerated if birth control is available. One clear example is China. Contrary to the common narrative, the one-child policy did not significantly reduce fertility -- fertility was reduced by jobs for women. What the one-child policy, coupled with availability of ultrasound technology did was to greatly increase sex-selective abortion.\n\nImmigration is a GREAT policy for reducing fertility rates, because in the next generation (especially if immigrants do not form single-ethnicity \"ghettos\") fertility rates decline to that of the host country.\n\nZero growth is terrible for decreasing inequality, because it reduces Schumpeterian creative destruction and innovation. This in turn is terrible for the creation of new more sustainable industries which could replace more destructive ones. So keep the growth coming, but increase incentives for making it sustainable.\n\nAlso, there is a clear correlation between countries becoming rich and becoming aware of the need to improve the environment. Poor countries are focused on helping people survive. There is no alternative to economic growth to save us all -- it just needs to be managed so as to be as sustainable as possible.\n\nSo again: yes, preferences matter. But to change preferences in the direction of sustainability is a two-pronged process. One prong is the negative consequences of non-sustainability -- hurricanes, floods, droughts, reduced land fertility, etc. As we have seen, even in clear cases, there is a strong reaction such that people put on blinders to prevent the need to change. This leads to the second prong, which is education, starting from a very very young age, in relating positively with nature, with animals, with natural settings -- and mixing races and economic groups to defuse the negative effects of fear of The Other, which prevents trade and labor migration, which are hugely positive. Education is slower but much more sure, and needs to start immediately so as to save us as soon as we become willing.", "created_at": "2019-11-18 19:53:57.776593", "updated_at": "2019-11-18 19:53:57.776593", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 457, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 38.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [64446], "is_liked_by": [5698, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53996, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 10006, "post_number": 2, "raw": "China has already installed three hundred and fifty thousand 5G nodes.

Normal font for common parts [_italic for parts specific to UNL_] [**bold for parts specific to my approach**].\n\nUNL is designed to establish a simple foundation for representing [_the most central aspects of_] [, **without preset constraints**,] information and meaning in a machine- and human-language-independent form. As a language-independent formalism, UNL aims to code, store, disseminate and retrieve information independently of the original language in which it was expressed. In this sense, UNL seeks to provide tools for overcoming the language barrier in a systematic way.\n\nAt first glance, UNL seems to be a kind of interlingua, into which [_source texts are_] [**live input is**] converted before being translated into target languages. It can, in fact, be used for this purpose, and very efficiently, too. However, its real strength is knowledge representation and its primary objective is to provide an infrastructure [_for handling knowledge that already exists or can exist in any given language_] **[that enables much easier aquisition and creation of knowledge, and constructive discussions, that crosses the present day cultural and academic boundaries**].\n\n[_Nevertheless, it is important to note that at present it would be foolish to claim to represent the \u201cfull\u201d meaning of any word, sentence, or text for any language. Subtleties of intention and interpretation make the \u201cfull meaning,\u201d however we might conceive it, too variable and subjective for any systematic treatment. Thus UNL avoids the pitfalls of trying to represent the \u201cfull meaning\u201d of sentences or texts, targeting instead the \u201ccore\u201d or \u201cconsensual\u201d meaning most often attributed to them_].\n\n[**I treat the context free \u201cfull meaning\u201d of words as a mostly a meaningless abstraction that is not worth pursuing as an aim. The only pertinant meaning to me is the one in the authors mind. The aim is to make that meaning available to the readers with the least possible deformation.

You can be much more effective if you signal you are privy to it, and therefore \"a knowledgeable player\", rather than \"a civilian\". \n\nA short history of the topic:\n\n* Circa 1990s: \"smart city\" is rolled out as a concept by corporate actors (the most important are IBM, Siemens and Cisco) and their reference universities (spearheaded by MIT). The construction of some (three) actual prototype smart cities begins.\n* Early 2010s: the prototypes have all failed. Meanwhile, there is a growing recognition that cities do indeed exhibit \"smart\" behavior, but not because of the technology, but because of a new way of connecting citizens to each other. I myself wrote a short blog post that gives you a good argument if you want to make that case: [What we mean by \"smart\" in \"smart cities\"](http://www.cottica.net/2012/11/28/what-we-mean-by-smart-in-smart-cities/). \n* 2014, Adam Greenfield writes a pamphlet called _Against the smart city_ ([Kindle edition](https://www.amazon.com/Against-smart-city-The-here-ebook/dp/B00FHQ5DBS)), that tears the concept apart. The smart city, he argues, is basically the new version of the modernist city dreamed by Le Corbusier: rational, simple, authoritarian, and wrong. It _never_, ever worked in practice. It cannot work, because it operates with a flawed model of people and their sociality. An embarrassed silence follows. He is simply right. From this point on, the academic debate on smart cities is over. The concept has no longer any credibility.\n* Late 2010s. \"Smart cities\" starts quietly falling off policy agendas. Meanwhile, a municipalist agenda emerges globally. This movement has a radical idea: cities are better candidates to run the world than nation states, or supernational organizations. Barcelona, where you will be, claims the mantle of leader of this movement: for example, they created a conference called [Fearless cities](http://fearlesscities.com/), that is now being taken up by activists that can count on sympathetic support from city authorities. In particular, Barcelona wants to do data protection policy, with the ambition to \"re-decentralize the internet\". The main player here is Francesca Bria, an Italian ex-Nesta who got hired as the city's Chief Innovation Officer. Her life partner happens to be high-powered techno-critic Evgeny Mozorov. Just weeks ago, they jointly published a book called [Rethinking smart cities](http://www.rosalux-nyc.org/wp-content/files_mf/morozovandbria_eng_final55.pdf). I have not had the chance to read it yet, but if you google \"bria mozorov smart cities\" you can find plenty of conferences, videos etc. I recommend you spend one hour doing so, as that will allow you to come smoothly into the debate. \n\nPlease, know this. I am personally interested in cities, and plan to take the Edgeryders Research Network in that direction. Academically, I am forming partnership with people in the Santa Fe Institute, including someone who was involved in the very famous [scaling laws in cities result](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/17/7301) by Bettencourt-West (which, incidentally, results, from a European Commission research grant). \n\nWhat Edgeryders can bring to the table is a rigorous approach to communities and their collective intelligence (which, after the downfall of the technocratic- and corporate approach to \"smart cities\" is more or less acknowledged as the source of the \"smart\"). If you want to lead an Edgeryders foray in this direction, we (and I personally) stand ready to support you in this. \n\nAlso ping @hugi.", "created_at": "2018-11-20 10:23:46.928072", "updated_at": "2018-11-25 20:57:13.643457", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 609, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 77.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3706, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61905, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10810, "post_number": 24, "raw": "[quote=\"ilaria, post:23, topic:10810\"]\nIf not, then we should trust our colleagues and accept the results.\n[/quote]\n\n\nIf you refer to me, I do... unless the final quality is obviously too low.

I could see that they have a lot of qualities and that singing and dancing is part of their life. On the other side I think that the societies are living many changes and that there is not a fixed \"culture\" but all of us are part of \"cultures\" that are changing and that are putting always on discussion everything and this is, in my opinion, something normal and constructive.\u00a0\n\nNow I am working as teacher and animator with a group of Sinti (Italian Rroma) youngster and I can see that they are living a very particular and difficult process of socio-cultural transition. They always speak their language among them but, at the same time, they are losing some of their cultural heritage (songs, poems and especially traditional jobs); they can't do the jobs of their parents but, at the same time, they are not seen like \"peers\" by Italian youngsters and even sometimes they didn't perceive themselves as \"Italian\". Some educators and social workers heve defined them \"youngsters on the edge\" because they live a life suspended between two worlds and two times.\n\nThis is one of the points I am interested in but I would like also to talk about prejudices and discrimination in Italy towards Rroma and Sinti people because this is a big topic and the racism toward them is even increasing as well as is increasing the ignorance and the \"closeness\" of Italian people toward Rroma and Sinti.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-12 12:58:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:24.228889", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 318, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1538, "user_id": 62, "topic_id": 1505, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I am just back form the final step towards Athens: a March (<a href=\"http://march2athens.tk\">http://march2athens.tk</a>) which left Nice on November 9th (just after the anti-G20), which crossed Italy and then Greece, finally reached Athens on May 5th.\n\nThe idea of the march was to talk about direct democracy, thanks to popular assemblies, taking the squares in a very simple way: the group reaches the place, opens the tents and settles the camp; and that's the moment for talking with people.\n\nThe reasons for having chosen Athens as final destination are, again, simple: Greece is the center of the economical, social and political crisis in Europe, and we wanted to support Greek people.

This is important.\u00a0\n\nProblem for cities in europe is that they aren't designed to have multifunctional public spaces. It is starting to shift, but it is still a long way to go. in Brussels for exemple you can't BBQ anywhere but in your garden, that makes it difficult because gardens are becoming something more rare when people are starting to live in smaller and smaller spaces. So yes there needs to be a new regulation. I know for Brussels what could help is people hacking the system in big number, the legislation almost always follows up then. But you have to know how to play media and politics before, so it isn't easy for newcomers to have that background. Having a guide of succesful tests could be usefull yes. You could develop A Taste Of Home as a platform for those experiments anywhere in Europe, and if communicated well people will use it as a guide.

Additionally, collaborators can already export from FreeAgent timesheets in PDF form, that are than authenticated on Digisigner.[/quote]\n\nQuerying the FreeAgent API works with data that has no audit log, so it may differ from the timesheet the user signed. While working with the DigiSign'ed PDFs does not provide a way to properly take over data automatically for reporting \u2013 PDF scraping is just a hack. Somebody would have to do it manually.\n\nAn option would be to use the FreeAgent API and then manually make sure the values conform to the approved values in the PDFs. But that's again manual work, not proper IT.\n\nAlso there's more manual work in this system as users can't submit their own timesheets to DigiSigner \u2013 for a reasonable price we'll only have one login there, so an admin person will have to create the timesheet exports and submit them to users and their team leaders for signing. That's good as a first solution (and I include the equivalent in the proposal above) but not good long-term.\n\nIf you want to have a look at the available timetracking solutions with audit log that I found (\u2026 and found too expensive):\n\n* [Clockshark](https://www.clockshark.com/) indeed [has an audit log](https://www.clockshark.com/Tour/Audit-Log) but [funny pricing](https://www.clockshark.com/Pricing).\n\n* [Kissflow](https://kissflow.com/timesheet/#pricing), [Avaza](https://www.avaza.com/pricing/) and [Clicktime](https://www.clicktime.com/web-based/timesheet/price) have audit logs (I think) but all have funny pricing. And I can't get rid of the impression that they all might be just the same whitelabeled product.\n\n* [Clockify](https://clockify.me/) pricing looks good: free per user, extra features per installation. But the \"audit log\" feature is marked as \"coming soon\" ([see](https://clockify.me/extra-features)) and will only appear in their 450 USD/month self-hosted version.\n\nI'm not keen on more work and yet another tool, esp. since this was never budgeted for.

So the model would represent the possibility to slide from a A(n) condition to a B(n) and the other way round.\n\nFor instance, this is the case of the ethnographical research at WeMake, as from an action taken locally there is a sliding to posts on opencare and discussions (like the one held yesterday by Ezio, Constantino and me). Even the \"locality\" concept was discussed as actions can be taken in hybrid and multisituated scenarios as well.\n\nAbout openrampette there was a discussion going on about whether consider it a community or a activity and if it can become a \"interest\" oriented community (like Edgeryders) or a \"results\" oriented one.\n\nLast, but not least, building together some common and shared ontologies (check the glossary proposal of Ezio) would definitely help to embed in the smoothest way the ethnographical research to the goals and streamlines of the opencare project where co-design and open participation are strongly of concern.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-10 09:55:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:52.434687", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 276, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34147, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 6617, "post_number": 7, "raw": "ping @nadia", "created_at": "2017-08-08 13:26:10.575765", "updated_at": "2017-08-08 13:26:10.575765", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33922], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72813, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 12970, "post_number": 7, "raw": "#featured \n\n[quote=\"johncoate, post:219, topic:12164\"]\nRiffing in my mind about \u201cSci Fi Economics\u201d and how with this virus we are in it in real time.

It's a late addition to the concept, but I find it quite interesting: these \"payments\" taht users can send to oen another are techncially just like \"selling a certain amount of nothing\" in a way that allows partial deliveries. It allows recording trades / transactions that happened outside of the platform, including compensation for services and products that sellers agreed to deliver <em>before</em> a network deal happened for them. It enables to use the software before a critical mass of users is reached that are needed for network barter deals to happen.\n\nPayments are denominated in monetary units, but are transferred as barter value, arriving over time as items that a user ordered whenever a part of the payment can be incorporated into a new network barter deal. Since they can take some time to transact, payments are a bit like P2P credits (of course), as there is no cash money that can be exchanged in an instant, but I think they don't create systemic problems (no collectivized trust problems as in complementary currencies, no inflation problems). Taking time to transact makes them also useful as a (limited-size) store of value.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-06 21:40:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:19.733179", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 294, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55891, "user_id": 5211, "topic_id": 9909, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Tak vysok\u00e1 procenta jsou opravdu varuj\u00edc\u00ed a mysl\u00edm si, \u017ee bez aktivn\u00edho vyvracen\u00ed podobn\u00fdch m\u00fdt\u016f se v dne\u0161n\u00ed dob\u011b nemaj\u00ed \u0161anci sn\u00ed\u017eit, bohu\u017eel\u2026 Tak snad projekty podobn\u00e9 EdgeRyders n\u00e1s nakopnou k je\u0161t\u011b v\u011bt\u0161\u00ed aktivit\u011b.

A key component here is being able to set up forms that help funnel and onboard people to do different things. \n\n**What we want to facilitate for the participant:**\nIt is easy to do one or more of the following:\n\n1) Find and contribute to a specific conversation \n2) Make their expertise visible and accessible to people who might want to engage them in projects/freelance work, \n3) Make their organisation visible and accessible so that people can discover and enlist/buy/promote/build partnerships with them \n4) Register to a specific event or several events at the same time.\n5) That the process cuts down the need to move between different pages to create an account, contribute to a conversation and or register to an event - everything can be combined into a one-stop url.\n\n**What we want to facilitate for event organiser/ person setting up a webpage or site using the webkit:**\n\n1. That they have different standard webkit form elements, that they can mix into a specific form:\n\n   * Personal/ professional block: Same functionality and layout of  [This form](https://freelancers.edgeryders.eu/join), but with these [Default questions ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/default-questions-professional-profile/13746)\n\n    * Business/ organisation block: Same functionality and layout of  [This form](https://freelancers.edgeryders.eu/join), but with these [Default questions ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/default-questions-business-organisation-profile/13747/2)\n    * Event registration block: same layout  and functionality of [this form](https://register.edgeryders.eu), but with added functionality of all available events being automatically included in the form with checkbox for each, and that user can opt to register for multiple events at the same time, with these [Default questions](https://edgeryders.eu/t/event-registration-form-default-questions/13728)\n    * Standalone slideshow form block: same functionality and layout of [register.edgeryders.eu](https://register.edgeryders.eu/), but with no standard questions.\n\n2. That they can edit the webpage or site by modifying code posted in a dedicated discourse topic (post on the platform)\n\n3. That the onboarding process is simplified thanks to Login via SSO: If the person filling in the form is already signed in as an edgeryders member - they just complete the form fields and when they submit, their contents are posted on the platform. If the person filling in the form does not have an edgeryders account, a new one is created for them automatically. Once they have confirmed their accounts the content is posted on the platform by their newly created user account.\n4. That they can add a checkbox with popup content. E.g to ensure a respondent has given consent for their data to be used a certain way, or for being put on a mailing list \n5. Ideally: That we can edit the contents of both confirmation message, and automated verification email.\n6. That they can set this up with minimal dependence on developers.\n\n### What this requires in practice\n\n**As a form creator:** \n   *  You need to be able to string together/ combine different standard webkit form modules with other modules from the webkit into one page/ url.\n   * You need to be able to easily find both the form you have created, and the responses to it (either via a tag search, or ideally,  have both form and responses published in a dedicated subcategory on the platform) ie associate a form with a category, topic and or tag\n   * You should be able to can determine which parts of the form are only visible to the Edgeryders community managers, and the person who has filled in the form\n* You should be able to  include multiple choice options (checkboxes)\n*  Do most of this through a wizard (i.e without being dependent on having access to a developer or being able to read long swaths of text containing highly technical instructables)\n\n**As a form respondent:** \n  * you need to be able to fill in any form as a signed in Edgeryders member and have the form show up in your activity feeds so that you can find it\n * you should be able to have all the available events to choose from show up with a checkbox for each - so you can register to multiple events at the same time.\n\n\n### Translation of what this means/requires into features requested:\n\n1. Markup in a Discourse topic that is the established standard of configuration for a form.\n2. A site to display & answer user created forms.\n3. A \u2018configuration wizard\u2019 to easily create (or edit) a form for any non technical user\n4. Each form can be referenced and displayed on any webkit site.\n5. Each form can create an account or use an existing account to post the response.\n\n### State of completion of the feature - development\n\n* Feature 1: done, requires documentation\n* Feature 2: not done, estimated level of difficulty/ time requirement is -\n* Feature 3: requires the post to Discourse feature to work (feature 5).\n* Feature 4: done, requires documentation\n* Feature 5: is being worked on by @nirgal.\n\n### Remaining work: Tech development\n\n**What we have now:**\n\n* A form component that reads from a configuration topic that can be hosted and edited on Discourse\n* It creates an account (yet to be tested)\n* It posts a topic to Discourse (yet to be tested)\n\n**What is being worked on right now:**\n\n* Logging in existing user\n* Posting to an existing topic / category\n* Testing all use cases\n\n**What remains to be done:**\n* Put together the standard webkit visual language: fonts, colour scheme, links, buttons etc\n* Production of configuration wizard: to easily create (or edit) a form for any non technical user\n* Input components from freelance form\n* Build webkit standard form Layouts:\n  * Full page with slides\n  * Standard lock module view\n* Clear markup for configuring and styling\n* Reference a form by topic ID => reuse on different sites and layouts.\n* Do more work on the script James wrote to be able to update existing topics (in order to get the wizard to work).\n\n### Remaining work: Production of (NON TECHNICAL) manual for event organisers\n\n* We want to get to: \u2018configuration wizard\u2019 to easily create (or edit) a form for any non technical user\n* To get this wizard to work we need the script James wrote to be able to update existing topics.\n\n#### FAQs from event organisaters:\n1. How do we create a new page from the webkit and how do we upload content into it (text + images)?\n1. How do we define/ create a link between each form and the relevant topic (e.g event) or category or tag that is on the [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/) platform?\n2. Can we have a directory of what tag is to be used to feature content in a dynamically updated webkit module?\n2.

So you take away value from all other investable assets, but it's not theft. So far so good :) Now this value is a one-time benefit for the issuer (\"the first person getting that money\"). So you can use it to jumpstart a system, but you can _not_ rely on being able to create that kind of value again and again out of nothing. It works only because of trust (of investors trusting your currency), and if you do many of these schemes in a row, you dilute your value proposition similar to inflation and will lose investor trust.\n\nThe value of all community currencies is based on trust (\"there will be people accepting this currency when I want to spend it\"). This trust works on very small scales of a few hundred people at most (\"I know these people personally, they are trustable\") or on very large scales, such as with state-issued currencies (\"so many people are using this, there will be enough around who want it when I want to spend it again\"). Note that currencies do not really work on medium scales (say 1,000 - 100,000 people). This leads to two cases how an Edgeryders-initiated community currency can work:\n\n1. **At the current, small scale.** All the pre-blockchain community currencies were of this type. They did not need any large-scale upfront funding (\"ICO\") to start working, and could _only_ work in small-scale communities of a few hundred people due to the trust limit issues. At this scale, there is no meaningful to do an ICO, as investors won't expect a financial return (and if only by interest of other investors who come in later \u2026). It is also not meaningful to put this currency on the blockchain, as only parties who trust each other will interact with the currency and the blockchain's purpose is to facilitate a currency in cases where the users don't trust one another. The currency would also not be convertible to state-issued money \u2013 without an ICO, convertibility makes no sense at all, we'd just use state currencies directly if we want people to use money. Rather, this currency would be limited to a reputation system (like the points on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)). It's still a currency, as it is spendable: on StackOverflow for example, one can spend ones reputation points as [bounties](https://stackoverflow.com/help/bounty) (additional points when people provide the right answer to a certain question). Still, this is not at all what Natalia has in mind \u2026 it would just facilitate exchange, nobody would become rich, so nobody would be _really_ motivated to contribute much more than they do now. So let's move on :)\n\n2. **At large scale.** For this, we'd need to create enough publicity to reach the critical mass of people for the large-scale community currencies (100,000 people? not sure). From this arises the need for funding (to reward people before the critical mass and large scale is reached, and for all the publicity efforts). And from this arises the need for an ICO as a funding mechanism (or airdrops plus sales, or other ways of selling a self-created digital token). Of course the ICO will only be successful if crypto-investors buy into it, so the currency has to be \"speculator friendly\" (allow wild ups and downs in the exchange rate). So it's not just a tool for exchange, but also a vehicle for investors. Both can be combined though: keep the currency usable in spite of its ups and downs by adapting all prices according to the exchange rate changes, so that prices are kept constant in Euro equivalents.\n\nNow for the second case: to not be a scam currency, the whole system needs to be designed in a way so that it can work on its own, at the intended large scale, once we spent all the money derived from the inital tokensale. Which means it has to work as \"just another mechanism for economic exchange\", but on a larger scale, and also being convertible to money. People would for example earn it from \"likes\" on the edgeryders.eu platform when producing valuable content, and can convert it to money at any time, or spend themselves on likes or bounties.\n\nIt is not clear to me (yet) if and how such a system can work as a reward mechanism, since it has not yet been done. So as a next step, we'll have to do some currency design proposals and simulations to have any idea how to answer this question. (Note that Steem is not a successful example yet, as I suspect they somehow spend value from the initial coin sales on author rewards to keep authors motivated \u2026 that works for now, but they will eventually run out of that money).", "created_at": "2018-04-12 12:58:27.207557", "updated_at": "2018-04-17 13:29:59.961711", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 955, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68962, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 12307, "post_number": 6, "raw": "@natalia_skoczylas @kuba_svehla @zalesjan thank you!\n\n[quote=\"natalia_skoczylas, post:1, topic:12307\"]\nNot sure how you want to proceed on that, we have an agreement people will be rewarded for both countries and posts written about it, but that\u2019s the extent of these decisions, to my knowledge.\n[/quote]\n\nIndeed, we have been running communications based on that - given that these decisions caught up with 2020, we will resume it as soon as possible and reach out to the people you nominated, but I will need a call before.

Development of dynamic project-specific websites based on Discourse data started as an experiment by Owen and me at the Participio hackathon in Medenine in 2018, was then explored further with the development of the Culture Squad website framework (paid for by Participio and the Culture Squad budgets) and then brought to its current state by  Owen for POPREBEL, NGI Forward and the Festival, under Nadias guidance and funding from her budgets. The most recent addition is a piece of software that posts content to Discourse without requiring a user to first register on the platform.\n\nThe resulting tech stack is a good example of how small aligned bets and experiments across our projects can lead to a consolidated technology and method. Through this experimentation, we now have the following:\n\n* A defined stack of tested technologies and methods to build these websites, and the in-house knowledge of how to do it \n* Some boilerplate code that can be manually cut and pasted to build new sites with less overhead\n* The beginnings of a consistent visual style for our front facing websites and forms\n* A \"minimum viable product\" middleware software that caches and packages content from Discourse to serve on websites.\n* A front-end framework to create custom forms that cook the responses into a discourse post and post it under a new user\n* A backend service that can handle the submission of these forms and create new users \n\n## A way forward: Modularity explained\n\nWe are now at a point where Owen can create new such sites for new projects, given time and money. However, Owen is a scarce resource, which limits our capacity to launch new project websites as we scale. Luckily the technical framework Vue.js, which all of our sites are built on, excels at modularity. By design, much of the current code is already modular and ready to be standardized into a library of components that could then easily be called upon to construct new sites. A component would then only have to be told what data to use \u2013 for example, to render preview cards of posts with a certain tag, or a gallery of user-profiles from a certain user group. \n\nGiven a library of standard components, and a defined language for how to configure them, a completely new project website might be rendered by supplying a template.   Some sites might need custom components, and those could just be defined in the scope of that site and called like any other component from the template. \n\nTo explain how this would work, the following pseudo-code template might render [the NGI Exchange site](https://exchange.ngi.eu/). \n[details=\"Click to expand pseudocode.\"]\n```\n{\n  \"brand\": {\n    \"title\": \"NGI | Edgeryders\",\n    \"logoSrc\": \"/favicon.ico\",\n    \"imageSrc\": \"/logo.png\",\n    \"colorPrimary\": \"dark-blue\",\n    \"colorSecondary\": \"light-blue\",\n    \"colorHighlight\": \"white\"\n  },\n  \"sections\": [\n  {\n    \"type\": \"heroBanner\",\n    \"body\": \"What should the Internet - and all it encompasses, which means pretty much everything - really do for humanity?

While it requires some technical aptitude to write these templates, it's a lot easier than writing the Javascript and CSS. It's also easy to document and teach, and creating a site with this template language can be done in a couple of hours instead of days. Further, the text is easier to update and new sections can be added without much overhead.\n\nA self-evident drawback of this approach is that sites built purely with our standard components would look quite similar. A few tweaks would differentiate the sites a bit, like a per-site color scheme configuration that is applied to all components, and custom cover-images for the header banner. However, if done carefully, we use this standardization to our advantage \u2013 perhaps it's hard to say what Edgeryders IS, but at least people will know how an Edgeryders project looks and feels.\n\n## Edgeryders landing page and associated sites\n\nOnce we have a framework like this, we can start building an Edgeryders landing page and an ecosystem of sites for different aspects of the company, community, and its projects. Owen has already built and sneakily released [start.edgeryders.eu](https://start.edgeryders.eu/), which shows the general idea. Building the landing page with this framework would just be another templated page, however with a few custom components. \n\nWhen launching a new site, we would not deploy it apart from the landing page. Rather, we would just add a new config file to our codebase, together with any necessary custom components. \n\nSome components would always be visible on all sites:\n* A top navigation menu (similar to the top navigation on the platform). Projects would be in the navigation while relevant.\n* A standardized footer, with company information and contact details.\n* Eventually, once it works reliably, your profile picture if you are logged in, and perhaps with a dropdown showing the same notifications as on the forum.\n![16|638x444,50%](upload://qBPb1RbVdc6WUDnqVLPBd141oEY.png) \n\n## Suggested components\n\nThis is a list of some potential components that we could standardize, to give you an idea of the potential. All screenshots are of Owen's excellent work, which would be the foundation on which configurable template components could easily be built.\n\n### Site cover header module\n![09|690x299,50%](upload://4F9omyLPpSjDDQccu0Rtj2mOLhE.png) \nA header module, allowing you to pick a custom illustration, decide on color and style, define buttons, titles and text.\n\n### Language selector\n![27|690x78,75%](upload://oibwfXBoO46dEzTLBrRBFudzaEI.png) \nA module which could change the language strings of a loaded site.\n\n### Stories modules\n![21|690x291,50%](upload://5r4gMnAhkfVeGrvBMMOgkZB7koX.jpeg) \n![45|690x346,50%](upload://oibnxbv4TDSKTIUjbMx5XOwqGDu.jpeg) \n\nShow stories from the platform which are loaded through a chosen tag. We probably want a few of these to vary between.\n\n### People module\n![02|690x312,50%](upload://1hViCHD63Y99gBQEO3QDBmUpWsH.jpeg) \nA gallery of people and their user profiles, which could be manually curated by inputting the user IDs to the template, or by letting it show some set of users through the API.\n\n### Events festival module\n![41|690x343,75%](upload://h2PaHJur3VBXKDyZu7zj2YLf0rI.png) \nAny project could now decide to run a festival, by simply including the events module and following its conventions when creating correctly tagged event posts on the platform.\n\n### Conversation preview module\n![30|690x202,75%](upload://Y8g74OQzWgp3hHBtWrxuxNNCBO.png) \nInteresting posts and replies can draw people into participating in the conversation. One twist on this would be to also somehow show the ethnographic codes of the posts or to even allow users to select an ethnographic code and see a selection of content with that code.\n\n\n### Social module\n![04|690x156,75%](upload://s0aOqKdr3J6WwIQUTHq0fNrlOET.png) \nAnother benefit of this modular system is that we could update components automatically on old sites when we make changes to them. For example, if Edgeryders gets an Instagram account and we add the icon to the Social module, it gets added automatically everywhere where the social module has been used.\n\n### Edgeryders description module\n![56|690x471,75%](upload://n7JPr9G56vFFlYSI4riq0mBHVOy.jpeg)\nAgain, as the description of Edgeryders gets updated, it would be useful to have an up to date module to describe the company/community in a section of project sites. Even if people stumble across an old project, the description of Edgeryders on that project page will be up to date.\n\n### Real-time chat feed module\n\nOwen has started developing some very promising interactive social media feed components that could allow us to have realtime content from various sources feed directly to our sites. This can be developed into a component that could either be integrated on project sites or run on its own on a designated social feed site for a major event.\n\n### On-boarding form module\n\nOur onboarding form is built on essentially the same tech stack as the mini-sites, and that framework could be turned into a module. Every time that module is called, you would only need to define in what category the resulting content should be posted. \n\nIn time, this onboarding form could be developed into becoming the default onboarding experience when first encountering Edgeryders. Instead of being thrown into the deep end of having to register on the forum and find a category to introduce yourself in, you would follow a step by step process introducing you to Edgeryders and asking you questions about yourself in the context of what project you are entering Edgeryders through. At the last step, it would send you a personalized boarding email and redirect you to the forum.\n\n### Ethnography & SSNA interactive modules \n\nFor our projects with ethnography and SSNA, we could build modules that display some of those results by querying the Graphryder API. A first step could be to simply make it possible to embed interactive versions of the user graphs and code graphs, configured in some way that makes them possible to understand. By starting to experiment with this, we would begin to write the beginnings of modules that we could then combine into a rewritten Graphryder dashboard that would then be much more maintainable than our current dashboard.\n\n## Expected outcomes\n\n### Better onboarding\nI predict that it will become a lot easier to onboard people when we don't throw them straight onto a forum. I have witnessed that it intimidates most people from engaging. Having a smoother journey that looks more like what people expect from the web these days, is likely to help us with engagement.\n\n### An even better offer from the ResNet\nWith these tools added to our arsenal, our offer to research consortia becomes even better. We can start making bids that leverage things like offering to build project presentation websites like that of the NGI Policy Lab. Adding an up-to-date public-facing presentation of the conversation, ethnography and collective intelligence also levels up our current offer.\n\n### New entry-level products to offer\nOne challenge we have is that we don't have much to offer a corporate client on the entry-level. Building relationships with corporate clients often requires you to first start by getting them to commit to a small investment, and then secure larger and larger contracts. If our capacity for building slick real-time updated websites with social content, we could use that to sell seminars and one-off events to build new client relationships. I think that our explicit goal should be to bring the costs down so much that we can afford to create a site for any project worth more than 10k EUR.\n\nAnother way through which this could become profitable is to sell setup of a white label version of the framework to communities on Edgeryders Communities. They could get their own interactive and up to date website built on content from their platform. If they need custom modules, they pay us by the hour, and those modules then become open-source and possible for us to use.

Plus the food, which we discussed many times while organizing our conferences and doing co-living. We always try to find a way to provide sustainable, affordable and responsible food for the participants of our projects. This was the case in our festivals (which I had a pleasure to coordinate twice already), and other projects - for example in Nepal, where I and @Matthias were lucky to have a cook at home, whom we could pay a decent wage and hire for our smaller events, allowing her to make some extra money. It was a way for us to spare time, learn a lot about local cuisine and plants, and support an amazing girl (not to mention give her some breathing time from the social tensions she experiences as a member of the lower class from her local employers). \n\nwelcome to the community :wink:", "created_at": "2018-04-10 15:13:06.018605", "updated_at": "2018-04-10 15:45:00.401058", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 286, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 89.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [43738], "is_liked_by": [4357, 5, 4448], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36062, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6660, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Guys, is this session happening?

By\u0142em w wojsku od 1950 roku przez dwa lata. Przeprowadzi\u0142em si\u0119 tutaj w 1971 roku z uwagi na miejsce pracy. By\u0142em funkcjonariuszem policji, dawniejszej milicji. By\u0142em komendantem. Pracowa\u0142em tam oko\u0142o 20 lat. Moja pierwsza praca by\u0142a jako funkcjonariusza posterunku w innym mie\u015bcie. Potem przeniesiono mnie jako komendanta tutaj. Pracowa\u0142o mi si\u0119 dobrze. Du\u017co pe\u0142ni\u0142em spo\u0142ecznie funkcji: by\u0142em radnym gminy, by\u0142em w OSP - Ochotniczej Stra\u017cy Po\u017carnej. By\u0142em spo\u0142ecznikiem. Przez ca\u0142y czas by\u0142em wybierany na radnego \u2013 ponad 20 lat. Kadencje tak jak teraz by\u0142y czteroletnie w radzie. Potem poci\u0105ga\u0142y mnie inne sprawy spo\u0142eczne: by\u0142em przewodnicz\u0105cym sp\u00f3\u0142dzielni mieszkaniowej, komisji rewizyjnej. Tak czas ucieka\u0142. \n\nMam prawie 85 lat. Lubi\u0142em ludziom spo\u0142ecznie pomaga\u0107, gdy uzna\u0142em, \u017ce krzywda si\u0119 komu\u015b dzia\u0142a. By\u0142em wra\u017cliwy na takie sprawy. Do dzi\u015b s\u0105 mi wdzi\u0119czni.  W szczeg\u00f3lno\u015bci pomaga\u0142em ludziom samotnym, jak mia\u0142a pijaczka w domu, stara\u0142em si\u0119 pomaga\u0107, poza prac\u0105 zawodow\u0105. Udziela\u0142em si\u0119 spo\u0142ecznie tam, gdzie uznawa\u0142em, \u017ce komu\u015b dzia\u0142a si\u0119 krzywda i ludzie sami si\u0119 do mnie zg\u0142aszali, gdy syn si\u0119 zn\u0119ca\u0142 czy m\u0105\u017c. Pomoc osobom potrzebuj\u0105cym nigdy nie jest zbyteczna. Trzeba wyczuwa\u0107 czy kto\u015b potrzebuje, czy jest zadowolony z tej pomocy. W wi\u0119kszo\u015bci zg\u0142aszali si\u0119 ludzie, kt\u00f3rzy wiedzieli, \u017ce ja mog\u0119 w tym kierunku pom\u00f3c. To mi dawa\u0142o satysfakcj\u0119, \u017ce mog\u0142em pom\u00f3c, \u017ce kto\u015b nie by\u0142 ju\u017c maltretowany. By\u0142o np. tak, \u017ce dana osoba, kt\u00f3ra do\u015bwiadcza\u0142a przemocy, by\u0142a na komisariacie, ale nie by\u0142a zadowolona z za\u0142awienia sprawy i zwraca\u0142a si\u0119 do mnie. Pomaga\u0142em i bra\u0142em pod uwag\u0119 dwie strony. Nie widzia\u0142em, \u017ceby by\u0142a taka instytucja, kt\u00f3ra pomaga\u0142a tak jak teraz. Gdyby by\u0142a, nie zawraca\u0142bym sobie g\u0142owy. Tam, gdzie by\u0142a opieka spo\u0142eczna, niekt\u00f3rych ukierunkowywa\u0142em, \u017ceby tam poszli. By\u0142y takie osoby, kt\u00f3re nawet nie wiedzia\u0142y, \u017ce opieka spo\u0142eczna jest, \u017ce mo\u017cna si\u0119 zwr\u00f3ci\u0107 w  sprawach \u017cyciowych. \n\nCzu\u0142em, \u017ce mia\u0142em jaki\u015b wp\u0142yw na to, co si\u0119 dzieje jako radny. Cz\u0119sto poruszali\u015bmy sprawy na komisjach. Nale\u017ca\u0142em do komisji kultury i szkolnictwa. Wiedzieli\u015bmy, \u017ce niekt\u00f3re sprawy nie s\u0105 widziane w szkole, nie by\u0142o zainteresowania nimi, ale poza szko\u0142\u0105 si\u0119 je widzi. Np.: widzia\u0142em osobi\u015bcie, te\u017c w sprawach bezpo\u015brednio zawodowych, \u017ce jest uczennica i powinna chodzi\u0107 do szko\u0142y,  a nie chodzi\u0142a, bo zacz\u0119\u0142a ju\u017c z ch\u0142opakami i unika\u0107 szko\u0142y. I rodzice nie widzieli, nie reagowali albo niekt\u00f3rzy nie umieli sobie z tym radzi\u0107 albo uznawali, \u017ce to normalne. A ja widzia\u0142em, \u017ce to nienormalne, dociera\u0142em do rodzic\u00f3w, anga\u017cowa\u0142em wychowawc\u00f3w i docierali\u015bmy razem do miejsca zamieszkania albo tam, gdzie poza domem przebywa\u0142a. W wi\u0119kszo\u015bci mieli\u015bmy do czynienia z dziewczynkami, bo ch\u0142opaki to tam... Jeden drugiego popchn\u0105\u0142. To by\u0142y jednorazowe albo parorazowe sprawy. Mniej by\u0142o takich spraw jak w tej chwili, jak narkotyki. To by\u0142y inne problemy: bardziej brak zainteresowania ze strony rodzic\u00f3w albo niepe\u0142ne rodziny, np.: tylko matka wychowywa\u0142a sama. Nieraz nawet i komisja radnych dociera\u0142a do nich. Radni byli te\u017c nauczycielami. To by\u0142o pozytywne. Bo potem widzia\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce te osoby, co schodzi\u0142y nie tak jak powinny, jako doros\u0142e pracuj\u0105, s\u0105 odpowiedzialne za swoje czyny. \n\nDo 1991 roku by\u0142em komendantem policji i do 1993 roku radnym. Rada (przyp.: przed zmian\u0105 ustroju w 1990 r.) dzia\u0142a\u0142a w podobnych sprawach bie\u017c\u0105cych jak obecnie. Tylko c\u00f3\u017c mo\u017cna powiedzie\u0107? Inne by\u0142y troszeczk\u0119 i pogl\u0105dy, i zainteresowania. Ale nie odczuwa\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ceby to by\u0142y inne kierunki w radzie. By\u0142o troch\u0119 wi\u0119cej centralnie zarz\u0105dzane w niekt\u00f3rych sprawach, ale to tak jak w tej chwili. Ale nie by\u0142o i nie ma takiego poczucia, \u017ceby rady by\u0142y tak centralnie sterowane. Owszem ma kontakt i nadz\u00f3r wy\u017cszego szczebla. Wcze\u015bniej czu\u0142o si\u0119 bardziej wsp\u00f3lnot\u0119 mi\u0119dzy lud\u017ami, nie odczuwa\u0142o si\u0119 wtedy podzia\u0142u ludzkiego. Wi\u0119cej by\u0142o zrozumienia wzajemnego, wsp\u00f3lnego dzia\u0142ania, czyny spo\u0142eczne. To by\u0142o modne. Teraz tego mniej si\u0119 odczuwa. Teraz odczuwamy wi\u0119cej nienawi\u015bci jednego do drugiego. Niekt\u00f3rzy sami nie wiedz\u0105 o co im chodzi. Brak jest wsp\u00f3lnej jedno\u015bci. Polityka podzieli\u0142a ludzi. Nieszanowanie jeden drugiego, ubli\u017canie, zniewa\u017canie. Jeden drugiego w \u0142y\u017cce wody by utopi\u0142 i to wszystko leci w mediach. W g\u0142owie si\u0119 nie mie\u015bci, \u017ceby tak\u0105 jeden do drugiego mia\u0142 nienawi\u015b\u0107. \n\nS\u0105dz\u0119, \u017ce jakie\u015b zmiany powinny nast\u0105pi\u0107, a jakie, to chyba ka\u017cdy domy\u015bla si\u0119. Jeden z drugim powinien dogadywa\u0107 si\u0119, a nie tylko wymy\u015bla\u0107 sobie bez bli\u017cszego kontaktu. Powinna by\u0107 zmiana od g\u00f3ry do do\u0142u. Jak jest na g\u00f3rze, tak i leci na d\u00f3\u0142. Na dole wyczuwaj\u0105, \u017ce jak wolno na g\u00f3rze, to mo\u017cna i na dole. Teraz nawet o sprawach prawnych wcze\u015bniej si\u0119 dowiadujemy - z medi\u00f3w - ni\u017c w rzeczywisto\u015bci powinni\u015bmy. Chocia\u017c media s\u0105 dobre, ale dany przepis np.: wp\u0142ywaj\u0105cy na \u015brodowisko, powinien wychodzi\u0107 z uzgodnienia. Zanim przepis zostanie przyj\u0119ty, to niech to b\u0119dzie uzgodnione, dograne, \u017ceby wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 polityk\u00f3w to akceptowa\u0142a. Bo bez tego, nieraz si\u0119 s\u0142yszy \u2013 przepis opracowany na kolanie. Potem wychodzi to nerwowo, z zaskoczenia i oddzia\u0142uje na spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo. Problemy powinny by\u0107 przede wszystkim konsultowane przez wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa. Czasem niby s\u0105 konsultowane, a potem si\u0119 s\u0142yszy, \u017ce jakie\u015b przedsi\u0119biorstwo dostaje zezwolenie, a to jest w efekcie szkodliwe dla spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa, lokalne spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo nic nie wiedzia\u0142o; czy to wysypisko \u015bmieci czy inne. To najbardziej ludzi bulweruje. S\u0105dz\u0119, \u017ce ludzie interesuj\u0105 si\u0119 sprawami publicznymi. S\u0105 ludzie, kt\u00f3rych to nie obchodzi, ale nie mo\u017cna uog\u00f3lnia\u0107 \u017ce spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa to nie obchodzi. Je\u017celi jest szko\u0142a, a za rok b\u0119dzie przybywa\u0142o m\u0142odzie\u017cy i na si\u0142\u0119 si\u0119 j\u0105 likwiduje, spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo b\u0119dzie pami\u0119ta\u0107, \u017ce podj\u0119to z g\u00f3ry narzucon\u0105 decyzj\u0119. Wtedy si\u0119 produkuje niezadowolenie w\u015br\u00f3d spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa.\n\nJestem emerytem po 40 latach pracy. Od 1991 roku mieszkam w tym samym miejscu. Og\u00f3lnie jestem zadowolony, tylko teraz uwa\u017cam, \u017ce zainteresowanie emerytami mog\u0142oby by\u0107 wi\u0119ksze. Ale mo\u017ce by\u0107 tak jak jest.

Waloryzacja powinna by\u0107 taka, \u017ceby emeryt nie by\u0142 w sytuacji czy mu wystarczy od pierwszego do pierwszego.

Trzeba por\u00f3wnywa\u0107 te warunki. Ale c\u00f3\u017c, emeryt nigdy nie by\u0142 tak mocno traktowany jak ludzie na wy\u017cszych stanowiskach lub z wi\u0119kszymi dochodami.

Dom kultury ma og\u00f3lne dzia\u0142ania, a dom seniora sam realizuje w\u0142asne programy dla os\u00f3b starszych. W naszej miejscowo\u015bci tego nie ma, ale wida\u0107 inne zmiany, rozwija si\u0119. S\u0105dz\u0119, \u017ce to mo\u017ce by\u0107 i u nas, mo\u017ce przyjdzie z g\u00f3ry.

There were many discussions (in French) on this platform with philosopher Michel Filippi about 'verrouillage', or locking behavior.\u00a0\n\nMichel Filippi suggested, as a solution, the Game of Man, where various models of possible human beings could coexist (with their own sets of qualities, values and corresponding business model).

Selecting a task that personally affects the hackers (like a web platform they use) is a good think \u2026</li>\n\n<li><strong>Learning curve.</strong> Much of the subject matter here (Drupal architecture) has a rather <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve#.22Steep_learning_curve.22\">long learning curve</a>, which means that in two days, you can either learn something about Drupal, or be productive with something you know, but not both. Might have been frustrating for some who would've liked to contribute more, but the task did not match well to what they could do. So for the future, such a hackathon would profit either from matching tasks and skills before it starts, or from extending it so that one can both learn and contribute with that later (which means about 7 days minimum).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Optimistic planning?</strong> It turned out that the task we chose to do (notification system overhaul) was too big to finish in two days. But we got two thirds through, and it forces me to finish it now :) So even though we were too optimistic, the hackathon was valuable to kick off a task that else would be around for much longer \u2026</li>\n\n<li><strong>Harmonics.</strong> Somebody said, \"It was harmonious because we had good food and a great space.\" Which we had, but I did not really notice until later because it was somehow implicit. The social contract / social dynamics behind the harmonious hackathon is a synergistic collaboration between techie and non-techie people towards a single goal. I think the contributions from the non-techie crowd (good food, great space) were not appreciated enough during this first harmonious hackathon iteration. So, for the future, maybe a short daily closing time that includes thanking <em>everyone</em> for their respective contribution would be nice :)</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2014-11-18 13:03:07", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:42.864453", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 344, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1450], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63127, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9881, "post_number": 88, "raw": "[quote=\"nadia, post:86, topic:9881\"]\nSkulle du kunna t\u00e4nka dig l\u00e4gga upp ett FB event med Blivande som v\u00e4rd/cohost \u00e5t denna workshop?\n[/quote]\n\nYes, just need all the graphics!", "created_at": "2019-11-05 23:15:23.368029", "updated_at": "2019-11-05 23:15:23.368029", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 48.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [63104], "is_reply_to": [63104], "is_liked_by": [5025, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65966, "user_id": 5698, "topic_id": 11863, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Aloha @felix.wolfsteller, thank you for your candid reply.

I'm sharing this, because I think he touches on some things that are pertinent to the discussion we've been having here, and I'd be interested to hear what you think about smart cities:_\n\nThis week, we published a story from Nafeez Ahmed about [the American and other foreign companies that helped build China\u2019s \u201csmart cities.\u201d](https://codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/silicon-valley%E2%80%99s-scramble-for-china/) Those smart cities have become a feature of Xinjiang\u2019s police state that now [persecutes Uyghurs](https://codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/uyghur-women-fighting-china-surveillance/).\n\nIt\u2019s a story about the dark side of a seemingly well-intentioned urban planning paradigm. Smart cities are supposed to be the bright future of high-density living, but China\u2019s government has been using this technology for human rights violations.\n\nBut does it really take an authoritarian government to bring out the dark side of smart cities?\n\nIn the past few months, I\u2019ve had a Google alert going for \u201csmart cities,\u201d hoping to keep abreast of where things are going. Almost every link Google sends me is celebratory, even utopian. Just this week, I\u2019ve been sent articles calling smart cities the \u201cFuture of Urban Development\u201d and a \u201cSmart Future for Smart People.\u201d\n\nBut there has been criticism as well, and a key one centers around a process that has seemingly little overlap with China\u2019s drive to build a surveillance state: the rise of \u201csurveillance capitalism.\u201d Harvard\u2019s Shoshana Zuboff, who coined the term, sees smart cities as a way for tech companies to expand the logic of surveillance capitalism \u2013 the endless accumulation of data to predict and modify human behavior for the benefit of advertisers \u2013 into the city.\n\nGoogle\u2019s projects in Toronto and New York, for example, have seen the installation of advertising technology on sidewalks, alongside free internet access kiosks. In other words, the logic of ad-supported platforms \u2013 free services in exchange for data \u2013 is literally being transferred onto the sidewalk. As David A. Banks puts it in [a recent column for Real Life Magazine](https://reallifemag.com/built-to-shill/), \u201cWith the surveillance technologies built into their Toronto and Hudson Yards projects, Google does to these buildings what they made billions doing to the internet: monitoring advertising opportunities.\u201d\n\nChinese-style smart city police states may be on the horizon in the West. In the U.S., for example, one could imagine ICE using smart city tech to track migrants in border zones. But another more immediate threat, the privatization of public space for profit, as in Google\u2019s Sidewalk Labs project, is already happening.", "created_at": "2019-05-30 09:51:47.044970", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 19:43:18.837227", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 458, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 162.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69164, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 72, "raw": "I see people work in headstand position at blivande?", "created_at": "2020-01-22 05:52:51.408326", "updated_at": "2020-01-22 05:52:51.408326", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 23.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [69155], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64594, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 11620, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Ahoj Vojto, d\u00edky moc za p\u0159\u00edsp\u011bvek a sd\u00edlen\u00ed osobn\u00edho p\u0159\u00edb\u011bhu.

The only \"speech\" allowed is introducing the background to the gathering, the process of which it is a part, the social contract that underpins it and (what the organisers and participants respectively are committing to during and after the event). \n\nThis introductory speech (should not be longer than 5-10 minutes and held by the organiser) is meant to be a repetition of what participants have signed up to by creating an account on the edgeryders platform, presented themselves and answered some questions on the platform. This ensures that everyone has had a look at the information/instructions and can iron out any question marks, that the research team can point out questions that can skew/bias the conversation in any one direction etc. Especially when you have a team where not everyone speaks the same language - written communication means that we can use translation services, ask for clarification is we do not understand etc. \n\nUsing  facebook groups, exclusive small meetings; The process by which you have been organising this event is not compatible with how we do things. Ours is one where organisation of events is discussed by the participants here out in the open on the platform and where people are invited to take part in shaping the events. \n\nThis platform is where we the holders/stewards of the project and Edgeryders can ensure that everyone is clear on what is being done when, where, by whom and can be involved where they want. It is where our staff and the broader community can ensure that expectations have been managed.\n\nOur online Community managers' role is to connect people across the different conversations on this platform, make visible what interesting discussions are being had, draw everyone's attention to drafts of reports to give participants opportunity to give feedback. The community managers have a lot of experience in making sure that the exchanges are civil and compatible with values of respect for the individuals integrity, dignity  and intervene if people cross the line of what is acceptable behaviour.\n\nThen we have the issue of guaranteeing consent - that each participant in the process has given their consent well in advance of showing up in the physical space where an offline event is help. When people sign up, there is an ethical funnel that they need to go through before they can create an account - that funnel has been technically designed and vetted by our ethics advisors in such a way as to ensure that we are in respecting laws, ethical guidelines and best practices regarding how everyone's data is handled. \n\nThis online platform is we can ensure that every participant has free access to and can interact with the other individuals who will participate. That they can see both the event, but also the project research team's work out in the open, ask questions - point out things that seem odd to them.

Or, more concrete, about 570.000 people bought glucose lowering drugs (metformin) in 2015. So the numbers are much higher ;-) According to the International Diabetes Federation, about 7,4% of the Belgian healthcare budget goes to diabetes care. Globally it is estimated that about 12% of the healtcare budget goes to diabetes.\n\nIn fact the biggest cost are the diabetes complications.\u00a0Type 2 diabetes is a sneaky disease, because in the beginning it does not affect your life that much, you'll be less inclined to watch your diet and your life style in general, which in turn enhances the chances for complications. These complications are very costly. For instance foot amputations (cost 25-60k), cardiovascular diseases, terminal kidney disease, blindness,.. Complications can be delayed or even avoided by life style changes.\u00a0\n\nWhile we're on the statistics, when comparing people with a lower socioeconomic status (SES) with people with a higher SES, at\u00a0 the ages of 29-44, we see that people with a lower SES have a 3x higher chance of getting diabetes. There are also numbers about Moroccans and Turks in Belgium, the have 2 to 4 more chance of getting diabetes than autochthonous Belgians. Women have it worst, about 11,5% \u00a0of Moroccan women and 18,5 of Turkish women have diabetes.\n\nSo (culture sensitive) education is very important, especially in the lower SES portion of the population, but the Diabetes Liga, the government, has problems reaching these people. I really think that Ekoli could do some valuable work in this area.\n\nPeople need reliable and understandble health information and there is a lot of garbage on the internet. Applying life style changes is not easy, but some studies show that introducing green areas in city districts, has a positive effect on the health of its inhabitants (now that's preventive healtcare ;-) ).\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-07 21:17:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:43.899095", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 413, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18487], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55965, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 10240, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Today, the Metro in Prague collapsed, because of annual summer reparations, nevertheless, the mismanagement of the situation caused thousands of people to get stuck.\n\nhttps://www.idnes.cz/praha/zpravy/metro-praha-prazskeho-povstani-doprava-komplikace-dopravni-podnik.A190701_102117_praha-zpravy_rsr\n\n_\u0158\u00edd\u00edme st\u00e1t jako firmu - jak \u0159\u00edd\u00edme st\u00e1tn\u00ed firmy?_", "created_at": "2019-07-01 14:05:08.574145", "updated_at": "2019-07-01 14:06:23.290430", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 49, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 26.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28122, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3620, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Lovely work</b>\n\nThanks @danohu and everyone, this surely comes in handy because it helps us build a common framework of understanding, I for one am using this already, even if it's unstructured.

It's hard not to, especially now. SARS-COV-2 has convinced central bankers and heads of government to magick into existence trillions of Euros in relief packages almost overnight, with very little hand wringing on public deficits. In a way, we live in a MMT world now.\n\nBut I am lazy, and so I waited for the release of a book aimed at the general public as a primer. We now have one: Stephanie Kelton's *The Deficit Myth*, released last week straight into the New York Times's bestsellers list. I have read it. Perhaps some of you have, too \u2013 I imagine @kevin_carson and @petussing, for example, to be familiar with MMT at this point. So, we are ready to consider MMT as a potential building block of Sci-Fi Economics. \n\n## About Modern Monetary Theory \nMMT's main idea is: currency issuers can never, by definition, run out of the currency they issue, as long as that currency is \"full fiat\", not pegged to something else (like gold or another currency). This has profound implications:\n\n1. A currency-issuing government does not spend tax revenue. Rather, it spends money into existence and taxes it out of existence. \n2. A currency-issuing government budget deficit is just a number on a spreadsheet, and has no economic significance.\n3. If a currency-issuing government issues the currency commonly accepted as payment for international trade, its foreign trade deficit is also just a number that has no economic significance.  In today's world, that would be the USA.\n4. Fiscal policy, not monetary policy, is the main tool for government intervention in the economy. Used well, it opens up a much broader array of outcomes than we are accustomed to seeing. More on this later.\n5. Inflation is a potentially serious problem, because a currency-issuing government could in principle stoke up a demand for more resources than are available in the economy, pushing prices up. \n6. However, inflation control as we do it today is inefficient. Moreover, it is inhumane. In many countries, authorities target a rate of unemployment that they think will not cause inflation ([NAIRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIRU)). In Kelton's vivid words, this policy \"uses people as human shields against inflation\".\n\n\nI find MMT compelling. It's not even a theory, exactly: Kelton calls it a description. It's based on accounting identities and careful consideration of the concrete legal mechanisms whereby the US Congress authorizes public federal expenditure, and the Federal Reserve issues and buys back securities. These are not theories or opinions, but facts. I cannot find any contestable claims here.  So, at least for now, I accept that MMT holds true.\n\n## MMT and science fiction economies\n\n### Understanding the Public Service Employment program \n\nI propose that some of [the science-fictional economies we have been looking at](/t/8582) are a good fit for MMT. It seems likely that those worlds are \"MMT worlds\". To make this argument I have to go a bit deeper into MMT's policy prescriptions.\n\nMMT economists are fans of [automatic stabilizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_stabilizer). These are components of public expenditure which react to the economic cycle, with no need for decision making. Taxes are an example: if the economy slows down and our income declines, our tax bill also declines, helping us to go through the difficult period. \n\nThe main policy prescription of *The Deficit Myth* is an unusual type of automatic stabilizer: a government job guarantee. The idea is this: the federal government hires anyone who is out of a job. It pays a not-very-attractive salary, but still a decent one, with health care and paid leave. When the economy is bullish, it is easy to find private sector jobs that pay better, so few people would want those government jobs. In a recession, though, many more people would take them rather than be unemployed. The number of people in these federal jobs, so, goes up and down according to the economic cycle, with no decision needed. This means *perpetual full employment*, which in turn means more buoyant consumption. This would help businesses get through the  recession in a less traumatic way. Workers avoid great suffering and productivity decline associated to long-term unemployment. \n\nOk, but in practice what would these federal workers do? Kelton: \n\n> Several MMT economists have recommended that the jobs be oriented around building a care economy. Very generally, that means the federal government would commit to funding jobs that are aimed at caring for our people, our communities, and our planet.\n\nThere is a detailed proposal for such a program in the USA ([report by Wray et. al.](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/rpr_4_18.pdf)), called Public Service Employment (PSE). Its main policy objective is of course employment itself, but there is a list of additional ones: \n\n> * To guarantee a basic human right to a job, as outlined in the UN Declaration of Human Rights and President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s call for an economic bill of rights.\n> * To implement an employment safety net. [...]\n> * To serve the public purpose. [...]\n> * To be used as a vehicle for addressing other social ills\u2014urban blight, environmental concerns, etc.\n\nOnly the federal government, as the currency issuer, can fund the PSE. But both Kelton and Wray insist that it should be up to the states and communities to decide what  constitutes \"public service\" for them. \n\nPSE is the cornerstone of MMT's policy: if past experiences are anything to go by, it could employ between 5 and 25% of the labor force at any given time. That is a lot of people, and what they do matters. If we could really deploy this much workforce towards nonmarket objectives, there would be a lot we, as a society, could do. \n\nMariana Mazzucato rightly claims that [innovation has not only a rate, but also a direction](https://www.climate-kic.org/community/mariana-mazzucato-mobilising-for-a-sustainable-future/). MMT is compatible with expanding that statement: *the whole economy* has a direction, not just innovation. Given monetary sovereignty, policy makers can and should target objectives, or \"missions\" as Mazzucato prefers to say, that are *not* economic per se: go to the Moon, eliminate child poverty, beautify cities, reclaim ecosystems, abate aggressively CO2 emissions etc. This is what makes MMT so useful for sci-fi authors, and so attractive to me.\n\n\n### Provisioning, not paying \n\nKelton insists that, when it comes to public spending, \"How will you pay for it?\" is a meaningless question.  Since currency-issuing governments create their own currency, by definition they pay for everything in the same way: they credit the Treasury account in the Central Bank. Treasury then goes on to use those account for paying salaries and bills. But there is a similar, meaningful question: \"how will you *provision* it?\" Which means: never mind financial resources, do the *real* resources actually exist to do what we want to do? Do we have enough skilled people, tons of steel, gigawatts of energy etc. to achieve our objectives? Are these resources lying fallow, or will we be competing for them with the private sector?\n\nKelton quotes excerpts from the speech president Kennedy addressed to Congress to ask it to approve the Apollo program. Kennedy used it to reassure representatives that America could put a manned flight on the Moon's surface: the skills were there, the manufacturing capacity was there. He never mentioned money \u2013 he knew money not to be an issue. \n\nA more passing reference is made at the WW2 wartime effort, the only time when America really achieved full employment. Again, what mattered to the strategist was provisioning the military: how many tanks can we make in a months? But wait, to bring them to Europe we will need extra ships \u2013 how many can we make of *those*? That depends on how many people we can hire in the shipyards and the steel mills providing them, which in turn depends on how much food housing we can produce for the extra workers in those areas, and so on. \n\nThis is how the better-thought through science fiction economies work. Take Kim Stanley Robinson's *Mars Trilogy:* in the first book, a hundred people and a lot of heavy industrial equipment land on Mars. Since on Mars there is nothing to buy, what they can do is limited by their resources. \n\n In order to do anything (say, raising the athmospheric pressure as a first step towards terraforming) they need a habitable environment that protects them from cosmic radiation (or they will all soon  develop cancer, and dead people do not terraform). But to build a habitable environment they first need to drill tunnels in the regolith, make enough air to pressurize them, and produce oxygen to make it breathable. This requires energy and plants. Fortunately, they brought nukes and a space greenhouse from Earth, but they need to manage them carefully across other possible (and competing) uses... you get the idea. Most of the Martian economy and society we see in the second and third book (except for people, since at some point Mars has strong immigration) are an outgrowth of the materiel and personnel landed in that one ship. \n\nIn economic terms, the Martian colonists are working with something similar to a [Leontief matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productive_matrix). So are the walkaways in Cory Doctorow's *Walkaway\". The latter have access to scavenging the default economy for unwanted resources, but at the end of the day they have to produce their own food, energy, vehicles, communication networks, with these things being both products and production inputs to other goods and services. Having transitioned to a moneyless economy, they face constraints  in terms of real resources. \n\nOther fictional worlds in sci-fi work have less of an explicit emphasis on Leontief-like input-output planning techniques. Still, they set themselves civilizational goals, and then shape their economies so that those goals can be attained. For example, the Acquis in Bruce Sterling's *The Caryatids* is basically a gigantic operation to reclaim ecosystems lost to climate change and other man-made disasters. Earth superpowers in Paul McAuley's *Quiet War* books and the Utopan Hive in Ada Palmer's *Terra Ignota* have a similar attitude. All these are much more compatible with MMT than with standard issue neoclassical economics.\n\n## Where is the violence?\n\nMMT could be an important piece of the completely different economic system so many of us are longing for. This is why we need to make sure we fully understand the conditions for it to work. Which brings me to the violence. \n\nVinay Gupta (@hexayurt) taught me to look for the violence implicit in societal and economic arrangements. This is important for those of us lucky enough to enjoy relative safety, stability and comfort, because it is tempting to assume that everyone is OK when we are. \"The war has started \u2013 [Vinay would say](https://youtu.be/EkQCy-UrLYw) \u2013 and you did not notice because your side is winning.\" So, where is the violence in an MMT world?\n\n### Why money is useful\n\nAccording to MMT, a currency-issue government can never run out of the currency it itself issues. Moreover, that government is sure that everybody will always want more of that currency. Why? Because it demands people pay taxes to it, and those taxes must be paid in the government's own currency. Why does this make the currency attractive? Because the government has the power, and the will, to harm those that refuse to pay taxes. According to MMT, taxes are not where government gets its money, because governments issue their own currency. They are there to make sure people accept that currency as payment. Without threat of violence, there is no currency in the MMT sense.\n\nThis view is fully consistent with historical evidence on how cash money was invented and adopted. I learnt it from David Graeber's fantastic *Debt. The First 5,000 Years*. Here's how it works: Athenian army engages in imperialistic expansion wars in the Aegean Sea. The problem is provisioning the army during the invasion, with the home agricultural land too far away. The solution is this: army attacks rival city, pillages its gold from temples, divides it up in small lumps, gives it to the soldiers. At the same time it announces that it is going to extract a tribute, *in gold*, from the occupied city. Athenian soldiers then walk up to farmers and exchange their gold against food. Farmers collect the gold and give it back to the Athenian occupation administration, which uses it to pay its goons and start the cycle all over again. Voil\u00e0: the occupied are now provisioning the occupants. Without violence, there is no cash.\n\n### The continuum of monetary sovereignty\n\n*The Deficit Myth* repeats several times that MMT only applies to governments with \"monetary sovereignty\". It then goes on to repeat that monetary sovereignty \"is best thought of as a continuum\". A government has it if:\n\n1. It issues its own fiat, floating currency. This excludes local and city governments; states that use the currency of other states (like Costa Rica); states whose currency is pegged to the currency of other states (like Argentina before the *corralito* crisis); and the Eurozone countries, since the ECB, not they, is the issuer of the Euro.\n2. It does not carry heavy debt denominated in currencies other than its own. This excludes many middle- and low-income countries, like Mexico, Brazil and Indonesia. \n3. And then there is *full* monetary sovereignty. This term describes the USA's unique position as the issuer of the currency used in international payments. They can ignore not only their internal budget deficit, but also their foreign trade deficit. In fact, the issuer of the global currency *must* have a trade deficit, otherwise there won't be enough of that currency to carry out international trade. This is called [the Triffin paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triffin_dilemma).\n\nIt is easy to see that monetary sovereignty is highly correlated with sovereignty tout court. The stronger your economy, diplomacy and military, the more complete your monetary sovereignty. And the USA has by far the strongest military in the world. A good reason to accept the US dollar is that, if push comes to shove, the US might make you. A country could refuse to accept dollars as a payment, but it would probably suffer some diplomatic pressure, at least. It has even been [claimed](https://www.counterpunch.org/2013/03/22/the-usa-attacked-iraq-because-saddam-had-wd/) that the American invasion of Iraq was motivated by that country's [announcement](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/16/iraq.theeuro), in 2000, that its oil exports were henceforth to be paid in Euro. Without a big military, there is no global currency. \n\n## To summarize... \n\nMMT is an elegant, robust, pragmatic body of work in economics. It is heterodox, but solid and difficult to refute. It enables much more directionality in how we run our economies, and it allows a for a broader array of outcomes, including full employment. Its attention to real (rather than monetary) resources makes it a good candidate for running a sci-fi economy, especially in planet colonization scenarios.\n\nAt the same time, the acceptance of currency in MMT is predicated on the threat of violence. This is not to say that competing approaches (say, money supply theory) are any less violent. Nevertheless, when incorporating it in the systems we imagine in the Sci-Fi Economics Lab, we need to pay attention to this violence, and make sure it is exercised with appropriate restraint, if at all.", "created_at": "2020-07-09 06:31:54.568022", "updated_at": "2020-12-13 07:49:57.164675", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2649, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 4037.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65295, "user_id": 5833, "topic_id": 11769, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Ask the person who is speaking right now what their name is, and if they already have an edgeryders.eu account?

Entuzijazam da se ne\u0161to menja na bolje u dru\u0161tvu me vodi odavno i uvek me je ispunjavao aktivizam, pa sam tako sa drugarima osnovao udru\u017eenje pre otprilike 10 godina koje se bavi(lo) uop\u0161te kulturnim i obrazovnim aktivnostima. Par puta smo dobili male grantove da ostvarimo zamisli i moram priznati da je to bilo veoma korisno iskustvo.

Trenutno se usavr\u0161avam u metalur\u0161kom in\u017eenjerstvu kako bih radio ne\u0161to novo na poslu i naravno ne\u0161to nau\u010dio i zaradio novce firmi, normalno. Recimo da sam zadovoljan poslom. Volim da \u010ditam, a pisanje ne praktikujem odavno \u0161to je bez veze... Mo\u017eda mogu u ovom prostoru da delim to \u0161to sam pisao ili \u0161to bih pisao? Volim i da vozim bicikl i provodim vreme napolju. Zanimaju me filozofija, istorija, politika, tehnologija, duhovnost... \nVidim da se pokre\u0107u teme o smislu i svrsi \u017divota, koje su bitne za svakog od nas. Bez \u017eivljenja svrhe te\u0161ko da \u0107emo biti u stanju da pomognemo ikome, pa je na\u0161 individualni razvoj ili sazrevanje bitno i za celo dru\u0161tvo. Tako mi ne\u0161to deluje.

Some emotions may be hypercognized, others may be hardly spoken of at all, yet the latter do not vanish and may appear in symbolic or somatic forms. Certainly, culturally specific emotional forms do indeed exist, as blends or as modifications of deeper drives* . Nonetheless, for the anthropological study of emotion to go forward, it must be admitted that all human beings share a common heritage. To argue that fundamental emotional impulses exist and are engaged in a dialectic with cultural constraints does not undermine anthropological analysis. Instead, this premise provides a better basis for comparative work and, perhaps more importantly, gives a basis for the humane anthropological claim that others are not so different from ourselves. They too are driven by contradictory desires for attachment and for autonomy; they too are subject to fears, anxieties, and grief; they too are transported by love and communion.\n[/quote]\n\nThis dialectical view of emotion and culture is the one I choose to take myself, and suits our approach very well, I think.

The original idea behind this is to reach really rural and remote people and provide them with good access to useful information. But to start this I was thinking about which lectures make most sense - and I think you have a very good example of one (I also agree with @saeed.qaisrani ). So I think the wider topic of hygiene &amp; health would be most helpful.\n\nI have already made a small collection of mp3 players, ear plugs for listening, some spare parts, and solar for charging the batteries. I have started to test them for reliability and easiness to repair and I am hopeful that most will survive many months before they have to be repaired. I think the cost of the audio lecture was 0.001-0.0005 EUR per minute (+ the cost of recording the lecture). The mp3 players cost about 3 EUR but the memory card also cost 1 EUR for 1 GB of storage (which is plenty). Sooo:\n\n1 Player needs to run for 4000 to 8000 minutes (66.7 hours). A fresh player will have to charge about 15-20 times for that. So that means they have to survive about 3 weeks of one use per day on average. If they survive longer or get repaired cheaply (very possible) then it gets significantly cheaper.\n\nIf you know what illustrations are needed those could be printed on a robust support (e.g. playing cards or similar). Some of them could also be designed to be copied by hand (e.g. as a memory exercise).\n\nA couple of advantages:\n\n- you know what gets taught\n\n- kids could be working at the same time, or be at home\n\n- less humans in the loop (has some disadvantages, but is perhaps helpful against corruption)\n\n- no literacy required\n\nLet me know if you are interested. I have much more thought on that but I really need advice from someone who knows the real problems in Cameroon much better.\n\nFeel free to get in touch. We can also skype or similar - it may be a bit easier to explain &amp; understand then.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-20 11:56:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:24.076802", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 399, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 25.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41397, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 7898, "post_number": 12, "raw": "For the record, looks like I will be over there to make the Academy video Feb. 6-16.

This is simply because it requires to build new (electric) superior cars/vehicles (for few individuals), infrastructure, support and maintenance systems as well as autonomy systems which is more attractive than the more financially cost-heavy investments of big transit system which are less flexible, more capital intensive and has less revenue per person (one car/person vs one train or hyperloop/many people). This is more interesting even though it's admitted that it's much more difficult and complex (i.e. people being involved in traffic) to build self-driving systems for cars than for airplanes as there are more vehicles and objects on the ground than in the air.\n\n[quote=\"2RowFlow, post:5, topic:9766\"]\nIt is an engine for building decentralized, scaleable, secure apps that are focused on helping society organize in groups for social, political or economic aims.

As I understand it, Holochain is a technical solution trying to replace the Internet, dependant and within this technical and social infrastructure that the solution wants to replace?

It's also in line with the style in [Nadia's examples](/t/10962/2), and we'd get material with full copyrights on our side, so we can publish it under an open source licence if we want to (as per the contract with Lorenzo). It still depends on a bright idea on the designer's side to transport the solarpunk theme with this style of illustration, but that should be possible to some degree.\n\nA futuristically looking stock image would not be taken seriously for The Reef materials, I think. I prefer an illustration for this.\n\nFor the Sci-Fi Economics Lab it could be different since that is clearly utopian already. @alberto's call to make I'd say.\n\n[quote=\"ilaria, post:19, topic:10962\"]Just FYI, any of these illustration examples would probably cost easily \u00a32000/\u00a33000 if commissioned to these illustrators.

A bespoke illustration (center in the mockup) is way beyond the scope of this contract and would cost upwards of 2k GBP. @ilara is that what you discussed?

The most polished works that Alberto showed as examples are all detailed, photorealistic 3D renderings, and _that is a ton of work_. I use this kind of 3D software (Blender) every now and then \u2026 so I think I have an idea about the amount of work. For this one for example, my guess is that 3000 GBP would not be enough at European rates:\n\n![image|345x194](upload://qfWtBIc3AjmNwmAcVGZtowEYcUP.jpeg) \n\nI will of course be really cool to have a solarpunk 3D rendering for The Reef materials. But the way to get to that with limited money is different and more medium-term than a fast-turnaround design by a professional designer in Europe.\n\n[details=\"Off-topic: how to get to our own solarpunk renderings\"]\nWe would provide some 3D raw data (3D scans / photogrammetry) of a candidate building to [my favourite Indonesian 3D studio](http://www.ayena-studio.com/), and ask them to transform it into a solarpunk styled building. We'd get the 3D model (which is no problem with these guys them, I did that kind of deal with them before) and with that model we can do our own 3D illustrations, as many as we like and from any angle. In a second step (with some more budget) we'd ask another 3D designer overseas to provide proper textures and background objects into that model. Over time we can build a little solarpunk 3D world from that model, which then provides the material for all our illustrations. And publish it open source, to fix that absence of open source solarpunk design materials that I noticed when looking for that a few months back. But as you see, all this is definitely more of a medium-term task.\n[/details]", "created_at": "2019-10-02 23:38:50.905117", "updated_at": "2019-10-02 23:50:35.880441", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 627, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 32.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [60414, 60330], "is_reply_to": [60414, 60330], "is_liked_by": [5201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64978, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 11659, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Jedna ze safe-z\u00f3n, kam se ob\u010das uchyluju taky, ale jenmo na tu tu\u017eku :)", "created_at": "2019-11-21 12:55:17.172318", "updated_at": "2019-11-21 12:55:17.172318", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [64852], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59682, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10811, "post_number": 12, "raw": "[quote=\"hugi, post:9, topic:10811\"]\na career of explaining network science accompanied by the accordion, following in the footsteps of Tom Lehrer?\n[/quote]\n\n\nYou mean there is *already* someone doing it? :open_mouth:", "created_at": "2019-09-21 12:07:10.565437", "updated_at": "2019-09-21 12:07:10.565437", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [59626], "is_reply_to": [59626], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60622, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11011, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Nice!

I suggest using the first floor. We could set up room marked 27 (just after the entrance) as a sort of living room for informal interaction, and the other three rooms (with 35-40 ppl capacity each) to host sessions \u2013 [see the venue plan](/uploads/default/original/2X/0/05582deb2c4ad81d5b62c7a8a8633d79b8c0aae1.jpg).

If the weather is dry and mild we can use the courtyard, but it might well rain.\n\nTimewise, I would propose a typical day to look like this:\n\n* 9.00-10.30: common activities: yoga, communal breakfasts, whatever is conducive to socializing\n\n* 10.30-13.30: three one-hour slots for session activities\n\n* 13.30-15.00: nice long lunch break (this is Italy, people)\n\n* 15.00-18.00: three one-hour slots for session activities\n\n* after 18.00: common activities.

I only had limited time to spend there; @mariacoenen also wanted to be there, but she had a glitch and could not come. So, I could only attend one workshop. I chose one called [The city as a common. Claiming for a mixed and inclusive public space](http://fearlesscities.webrussels.org/commons/). The main people running it come from [Commons Josaphat](https://commonsjosaphat.wordpress.com/commons-josaphat/#English). Here is what I learned:\n\n* There is a company called [SAU](http://www.sau.brussels/fr/la-societe-damenagement-urbain-de-la-region-de-bruxelles-capitale) (Urban Development Corporation), whose main shareholder is the Brussels Region. This company holds the property rights for  a substantial share of Brussels' surface, and specifically the whole canal area (including Josaphat). Its mission is to \"implement development plans in the strategic areas\". \n* SAU is developing [strategic areas](http://www.sau-msi.brussels/en/strategic-areas) that involve most municipalities in the Brussels region. No one knows what they are cooking. In the case of Josaphat, there is something called \"competitive dialogue\" between SAU and real estate developers that is kept confidential. Commons Josaphat was considered \"too radical\" by SAU to participate to this dialogue.\n* The development plans for several strategic zones, including Josaphat, are expected to enter a phase of public review starting in late 2018. This creates a window for citizens to have their say.\n* Problem: according to Josaphat Commons folks in the room, this is the classic rigged process, where citizens will receive dossiers of thousands of pages and be given a few days to make their observations. Real estate developers will be super-prepared as they push a program of privatization, luxury apartments etc. etc. So, they will get what they want _and_ claim to have been democratic, inclusive, etc.\n\nIn this context, we discussed the possibility of crowdfunding for \"civic scholarships\" to allocate to journalists, researchers, and maybe even lawyers for investigating the plans that are being prepared by SAU and its partners, and how citizens could respond. Of course, the advantage of crowdfunding is that it creates communication around the project at the same time as it collects money to fund it. \n\nAs a proud Bruxellois, I would gladly donate to such a crowdfunding campaign. I am not sure how I and Edgeryders could contribute to organizing it... I don't have the comm skills. Maybe @mariacoenen has some ideas. \n\nI left my contact info with the Commons Josaphat group, led by [Hanne Van Reusel](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00100882). \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0dcdbd3b62b67159ebf0bd45d4e123880f8d8eff.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"418\">\n\n\n I did not meet @anncassano though... shame!

Today, Haven for Artists acts as a network for a variety of local and regional artists, with the purpose of providing the necessary resources to forge creative collaborations and develop a community of artists; a community for the arts, by the arts.\u201d  Haven for Artists runs a multitude of programs and activities such as with gatherings, exhibitions, events, the Havenhouse, workshops, networking, residencies and a a fully equipped recording studio, logistical, technical and creative assistance which all Haven residents and artists have access to. \n\nHaven gatherings and events attract hundreds of art enthusiasts and attendees and have hosted over 210 participating artist, by hosting 40 artistic gatherings, 35 screenings, 120 jam sessions, 2 festivals, and a 10 day Arts Fair hosted in the French Institute; which include exhibitions, musical performances, and spoken word. \n\nAt Haven, we work hard to foster collaboration between different artists and across disciplines, and we do our best to promote knowledge sharing in a sustainable manner. \n \noverview-Haven for Artists and the work we do: we are an art collective based in central Beirut, but operational across Lebanon. We are youth and locally-run, and on top of that, we are apolitical and a 'safe space' where only art counts, and no other social or demographic markers. This is very important to how we operate in Beirut. \n \nOur aim is to promote the arts - and specifically, talented and yet 'underground' artists - in Lebanon, by offering them support in their practice, and encouraging inter-disciplinary collaborations. We host a variety of exciting art events (exhibitions, festivals, concerts, jam sessions, screenings, poetry slams...) across the country on a regular basis, and from our 'Haven House' in central Beirut, we offer a changing weekly schedule of workshops, discussions, screenings and exhibitions. We also have a concept store where we sell our artists' work, and we are proud to offer a bookshop of works that are very difficult - if not impossible - to find in Lebanon!\n \nThis year (2016/2017), we launched our residency programme, which we are very, very excited about! To date, we've hosted Belgian, Spanish, Brazilian, British, German, French, Swiss, Syrian and Lebanese artists, and we are currently in the process of selecting our next residents. We have space for four residents at a time, and our residencies are individually-tailored, and on a project-basis. Haven also runs an in-house gallery and recording studio which residents and Haven artists have access to. \n \nWe'd love to talk to other organizations more about the residency programme listings they have, and how we could potentially collaborate and/or exchange artists, ideas or just join the network that assists artists in linking to one another, to break from the cultural and border restraints of the world and create a more open dialogue for arts and culture. \n\n\n_**A short summary **_\n_**Dayna Ash\u2019s project :**_\n\nI grew up in California as a kid, yet I was not a very good kid (in my parents perspective) and it took me 12 years to make them proud, a long and challenging road but one worth it to the very end. Coming from the states it was easy to visualize something better as I have seen it, in the sense of freedom to build, aspire and grow. \n\u201cI came here 12 years ago to save myself from my mistakes as a child, and when I failed here-as I also made a lot of mistakes here-  it became a journey in which i hoped to accomplish a better understanding of myself and that which I wa lacking. I needed to learn  how to save my own future from my past, as I don't believe in present.\u201d\n\nI am not here to save beirut or lebanon nor to get the artist out of depression(on the contrary they can create better art like this). If we don\u2019t act and better life for ourselves, no one else is going to feel the need to change and empower or strengthen the ones around them. I do all I do to save my own  life and when I do good my brother will do good and his friends and the chain reaction goes on.\n\nI started the project because I needed it, I needed this space and sense of community. And the Haven house became \u201cfreedom\u201d in walls. The point is to empower one another with intellect and ideas, with opinions and hope, will and ambition. \n\n\u201cI needed my city to be better than it was and I needed to know that I can stay here because I didn\u2019t have the passport to leave it. So I needed to be better for me and better for my community so we can have a reason to stay\u201d\n\nI received a lot of  support emotionally mentally physically and on ground support from my beautiful group of friends \n\nHaven gives me the freedom to [not be afraid to] fail. It didn\u2019t stop me from changing and failing.\n\nIt all started under a staircase where tina and chris performing and saying their poems  (30 persons listening) then it grew up,one gathering after the next- one gathering after another, and then we realized that  we don't have enough space to put  all these musicians on stage . There we realized that people needed it; they needed to share the stage not to fight for it, they needed this sense of  community/ brotherhood/ sisterhood. And here, I sensed a lot of oppressive facets that I knew I had to change, the competition placed on the shoulders of artists. The competition with one another for attention, for admiration for a sense of recognition.  I hope that the art is enough to discuss, to engage one another in- to grow and inspire one another, and even in judgement to take it in if constructive, bars and venues that encourage but also cripple by creating competition and strife within the whole. \n\nFor 5 years we had no idea what to do, we took it  one step at a time, I wanted to be an NGO to be apolitical and non-religious not an association or corporation (I think in Lebanon on the basses if you are an organization with a lot of reach you will be of an impact or encouragement in a sense)\n\nI just wanted a salary to live from, didn't want to make money with this. Also I  refused to get help from my family or father\u2019s contacts.\n\nHaven saved me, as it was never one thing,or one role.  it was never just visual arts or never just writing, never just for Lebanese or just for Palestinians it was and is for everyone from every discipline and also those without. A safe and welcoming space for artists and thinkers alike. \n\nHaven when it started was my way to empower my writing, I\u2019ve been writing since I was a kid, so Haven gave me my first platform. It encouraged me and others to try, to express, to fail. It is was all ok; it was accepted to fail and accepted if you found the answers you had been looking for.\n\n**Challenges**\n\nThe hardest and most challenging hurdle Haven and I have faced was getting registered as an official NGO.\n\nAt first it was a mIsunderstanding and miscommunications due to the somewhat of a- if not completely- faulty system. \n\nFor the past 5 years it was a bureaucratic dilemma but then it was all put on hold  for 2 years and then it took a year and 3 month  till we finally we got the approval (yet still didn't formally finished complete.) \n\nEverything in this city is against whatever u create and at the same time always with you. This create this paradox or contradiction is the constant struggle; you think you  have succeeded only to realise you haven\u2019t- over and over again. \nReaction of society\n\nI have mixed feeling about society; a lot of people want us to get more political and more activist-like there are lots of artists-they think artists should be more involved. But I don\u2019t think so, I think art is not confrontation, it's more about freedom of expression and allowing a voice to exist among others.\n\nI think that the good impact of Haven is that it reminds people that they are not alone, that there are others who think and are moved just as they are. That the questions that haunt and plague them are not only theirs to bear. The freedom to be yourself and not question your validity. \n\n**How can I help others?**\n\nBy giving them the freedom that they didn't have when they were young, the freedom to think more and question more. As well as giving them a supporting community, we all need someone who understands and relates, it is a common bond that we all share, the need to belong. I hope belonging can be accessible again by reminding them that they are individuals and not to follow the social understanding of freedom, expression and the notions that drive us.

In the other hand people are waiting for the public transport which is not that efficient. \n\nSDGs 11 sustainable cities and communities\n\n\n**project IDEA:** \nmy team is aiming to create fictive bus stations where we will have cars passing by people and take them where they want in a secure and fast way.\n* the stations are created by the app team. we create a station in a place where a lot of people go there and a lot of traffic get by that side \n* we also get the ID card and driver's license of new app users ( and we confirm them )  so that we provide a secure way to experience this new carpooling service.\n\n\n\n**Product design template:**\n* Business strategy: There is at important times like 8 am, an important traffic with cars containing only one person and people waiting for public transport. We are creating and implementing a system that provides a fast and secure alternative for public transportation through cars.\n* Value driver metrics: the number of the cars that have 4 people inside of them is the tool by which we can state how successful we are.\n* Possible Solution options: Bolt an app to call for a taxi, Facebook, through the groups we organize carpooling.\n* Objective: making 1000 followers and app users. These 1000 users should understand well the app \n* Customers: anyone who did the carpooling with a successful transaction; each time we get a successful transaction a little money will be versed to us \n* Costumer value: a secure and easily matchmaker carpooling.\n* Consumer Outcome: saving money and time on a daily basis. Also, since it will be car trip instead of public transport one, he will also gain comfort.\n* Possible solution options: Bolt a taxi call app, facebook groups to organize carpooling. these solutions are either expensive or hard to have the matchmaking.\n* Hypotheses: We are not quite sure that with our solution we will have a lot of new people adopting carpooling ( since we asked only 150 people and many of them are biased by our friendship) \n* Smart objectives: having 1000 active and daily users by 2020. having stations in 5 to 10 universities.\n\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18s6VeAAgddm9P-OVEvMsN_UAy6fUF9av?usp=sharing", "created_at": "2019-11-23 23:29:02.246029", "updated_at": "2019-11-24 09:30:40.612207", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 442, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 14.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61417, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11145, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Ok will add the forward logo as well.", "created_at": "2019-10-15 12:20:18.265434", "updated_at": "2019-10-15 12:20:18.265434", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 57.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55998, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10188, "post_number": 35, "raw": "(Staying studiously out of it) :sunglasses:", "created_at": "2019-07-01 17:41:45.377983", "updated_at": "2019-07-01 17:41:45.377983", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 8.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [55996], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58278, "user_id": 5209, "topic_id": 10599, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hi Alberto, great to e-meet you today.

They're nicely mixing the personal and the professional, painting a broader picture of how their lives have unfolded in these circumstances - growing up in the capital city and leaving for a better life abroad, or coming back to a small town somewhere in Poland with a difficult challenge. There's so much about young people's existence in these stories - the precarious conditions in which we live, the uncertainty of the future, sometimes even physical danger in which we find ourselves because of who we are.\n\nI strongly encourage you to read and get inspired to share your own experience - we have a whole bag of prizes still to be given away for best stories from Poland, Czech Republic and Serbia (remember, you have to be an active member of the community as well to get it). \n\nAla: [Fajterka](https://edgeryders.eu/t/fajterka/10476) - Story of an activist who comes back to her small hometown to continue her activism and educational mission, despite not fitting the \"norms\" and ideas people around her seem to protect very strongly. \n\nPaula: [Dlaczego zosta\u0142am edukatork\u0105 seksualn\u0105](https://edgeryders.eu/t/dlaczego-zostalam-edukatorka-seksualna/) - A different scenario of a capital born and raised educator who decides to leave Poland, despite her great passion for sex education in her home.

Take the best things we learn from each, and also listen for the worst things too, so we hold awareness of what to avoid. Each community has its shadow side too.\n\nWhat I've gleaned so far:\n* NVC is indispensible. A clear understanding of human needs, and a language to articulate emotions and requests, how to give empathy in a way that heals, and how to resolve conflict. \n* Attunements from Findhorn. A simple and quick group circle at the start of a process (work, or play) to tune into each other and what's about to happen. Truly magical.\n* Hand signals for meetings and sharings. A good system of these saves so much time, allow for better flow of communication, and for people to express and contribute without interrupting the current speaker.\n* S3. Where to begin. This system of governance hold so many little treasures for keeping a group on point and looking after the needs and desires of its members. Inspired by classic sociocracy, but also NVC, and Agile and Lean programming ideas.\n* The value of Elders. \n* Spirituality. In the three oldest communities I visited a sense of shared or individual spirituality was integral to their makeup. \n* The importance of a shared vision, that is bigger than the life of an individual. This is key. That I'm here for a bigger purpose than myself. The reason is: When things turn to shit (as they inevitably will, with life's ups and downs), if I'm only there for my self-interest, I'll just pack my bags and ship out. If everyone does this the community dies. If we are there for a bigger reason, we know there's something more at stake, and are less likely to give up on it. Thus the community has more chance to survive.\n* Permaculture\n* Most new communities fail, not because they don't have food or power, but because they can't deal with interpersonal shit, and have poor governance.\n* A community is strongest when it is a community of diverse individuals, rather than a collective of followers.", "created_at": "2018-12-06 21:02:24.869867", "updated_at": "2018-12-06 21:02:24.869867", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 406, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 118.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [49275], "is_liked_by": [2915, 3, 2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54120, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9953, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Could you say more about this issue rooted in the infrastructure of the default web?

A smart community outperforms any of its members; this is the result of people working together, improving on each other\u2019s work. So, we use new community building and community management practices as well as  graph theory, combined with ethnography, to access the wisdom of the crowd. You can think of it as a human centred alternative to artificial intelligence. \n\nWe aspire to bring the citizenry\u2019s collective intelligence to contribute to a more grounded public policy. Over the years, we have engaged and connected many individuals in an online forum with about 6,000 registered user and 70,000 posts. Besides their scientific output, our research projects tend to bring about real-world impact, as they inspire initiatives by the respective communities. We are especially interested in regional economic development, citizen engagement, participatory culture, citizen science, transitions to a low-carbon economy, social innovation and societal resilience.\n\nOur methodology is based on what we call [Semantic Social Networks ](http://bit.ly/digital-ethnography). It has several advantages:\n\n* **Grounded in lived reality**. We use methodologies and tools that treat participants as protagonists and experts in the conditions of their lives. What patterns emerge from their individual actions and experiences? What are they convinced enough about to put their own time and energy into?\n* **Robust**  to ill-defined questions. Exploratory questions are important. Who is doing the most interesting work on X? Which trends are emerging around Y? Free-form conversation minimizes framing biases and encourages serendipitous discovery.\n* **Scalable**  . Edgeryders projects can result in large online conversations, with hundreds or thousands of participants. We use graph theory to aggregate them, and extract from them what is most important or unexpected.\n* **Rigorous**  . Mining Semantic Social Networks yields qualitative and quantitative research. We apply network metrics to score and weigh the qualitative conclusions of ethnographers.\n* **Beautiful and intuitive**  . Everything we do is a network, and networks are easy to visualize. In fact, most people find them intuitive and beautiful. We provide visualizations of our data with all our projects.\n\n## You can help.\n\n**Get in touch.**  Edgeryders can support the work of changemakers in more than 80 countries because people like yourself support us with knowledge, contacts and resources.\n\nContact us on [Email](mailto:nadia@edgeryders.eu) / [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/JawU61gzONdIftzzvAyvUg)", "created_at": "2020-06-22 06:36:30.682031", "updated_at": "2020-06-22 06:56:14.506284", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 420, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 56.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6679], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79622, "user_id": 6455, "topic_id": 13911, "post_number": 7, "raw": "@Nadia for this week's newsletter do I need to make a fresh page and add this newsletter template in?

Tako studenti mogu dobiti jako vazno iskustvo u stvarnom radu i na projektima koji ih bas interesuju a uz to i finansijsku nadoknadu a oni ce startupove kostati manje nego jako iskusni ljudi naravno.

The fun part about them is that numerous individuals from all walks of life and practitioners from different professions/disciplines have contributed to the development of a solid body of knowledge spanning 20+ years.\n\n\n## 1. Infrastructures for Peace\n\n**[Infrastructures for Peace](https://www.peaceportal.org/web/i4p/i4p):** \u2018dynamic network of interdependent structures, mechanisms, resources, values and skills which, through dialogue and consultation, contribute to conflict prevention and peacebuilding in a society\u2019.\n\n**Establishing a national or MENA \u2018Infrastructure for Peace' may include:**\n\n* development of institutional mechanisms, appropriate to each country's culture and context, which promote and manage this approach at local, district and national levels;\n* adoption of a cooperative, problem-solving approach to conflict based on dialogue and non-violence, which includes the main stakeholders.\n\n**Such an infrastructure can help** a fragile, divided, transitional or societies recovering from violent conflict build and sustain peace by:\n\n* managing recurring conflicts over land, natural resources or contested elections;\n* finding internal solutions, through mediated consensus or multi-stakeholder dialogue, to specific conflicts and tensions;\n* negotiating and implementing new governing arrangements- such as new constitutional provisions- in an inclusive and consensual manner.\n\n**Essential components of peace infrastructures can include:**\n\n* National, District and Local Peace Councils- comprised of trusted and highly respected persons of integrity who can bridge political divides and who possess competence and experience in transforming conflicts;\n* National peace platforms for consultation, collaboration and coordination of peace issues by relevant actors and stakeholders;\n* A Government bureau, department or Ministry of peace building;\n* Passage of legislative measures to create national \u2018Infrastructures for Peace' with appropriate budgets;\n\n**Based on past practice it's features could be:**\n\n* Expanding the capacities of national peace building institutions, related government departments, Peace Councils and relevant groups of CSOs;\n* Establishing an effective early warning and early response system;\n* Renewing and using traditional perspectives and methodologies for conflict resolution;\n* Promoting a shared vision for society and for a \u2018culture of peace'.\n* These components are not mandatory, but are among the possible pillars for building \u2018infrastructures for peace'.\n\nThe fun part about Infrastructures for Peace is that it can be established top-down, through governmental policies and coordination structures, or bottom-up (as I prefer :D) via local initiatives such as peace committees that may or may not be connected to a national infrastructure, but through a distributed network of Open Care Centers, for example. I am happy to share some case studies in case someone would like to to learn more about the practical experiences in diverse contexts. \n\n## 2. Do No Harm as an essential element of conflict sensitivity\n\nThis is a pretty cool concept borrowed from the healthcare and bioethics. _Primum non nocere_ (first, do no harm) is the Hippocratic Oath that all medical students are taught in school. Back in early 90's, CDA, a peacebuilding NGO, developed a framework for analyzing the impact of aid on conflict\u2014and for taking action to reduce negative impacts and maximize positive impacts of their work. The \u201cDo No Harm Framework\u201d came from the experiences of people participating in CDA consultations and feedback workshops, including other NGOs, experts, donors, and policy makers collaborated through the project to identify common patterns of interaction between aid and conflict.\n\n**The Six Lessons of Do No Harm in this brilliant [book](http://cdacollaborative.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Final-2015-CDA-From-Principle-to-Practice.pdf)**\n\n1. Whenever an intervention enters a context it becomes part of the context. The intervention is placed in the middle, under the context, representing that it is now part of the context.\n2. All  contexts  are  characterized  by  Dividers  and  Connectors. The context already has Dividers and Connectors. The intervention is between them.\n3. All interventions interact with both, either making them worse or making them better. The arrows flow from the intervention to Dividers and Connectors because the intervention is having an impact on both. That impact can be negative - Dividers get worse by increasing; Connectors get worse by decreasing. That impact can be positive - Dividers get better by decreasing; Connectors get better by increasing.\n4. Actions and Behaviors have Consequences (ABC), which create impacts. The flow from the intervention to Dividers and Connectors is the ABCs. Resources and Messages flow from the intervention into the context. These affect Dividers and Connectors, making them either worse or better.\n5. The details of interventions matter. Conceptually, within the Framework,  this lesson applies earlier as it is integral to understanding the Intervention. \n6. There are always Options. Where we see impacts from the intervention, we develop options to counter the negative ones. We can also attempt to support the positive ones further. \n \nThe fun part about Do No Harm is that there is no formulaic approach to using this tool. It cannot substitute for knowledge or thinking, but it is something a thinking person can use to improve his/her work.\n\n**DNH has been used  by peacebuilders in the following ways:**\n\n* As an initial conflict analysis tool\n* For conflict mapping and identifying stakeholders\n* As an early warning system by tracking how Dividers are trending\n* For identifying areas of shared interest and concern\n* To transform mindsets, bringing people to a place where they form and improve relationships with \u201cthe other\u201d\n* As a tool for focusing constructive dialogue around shared problems\n* To help motivate people to work on peacebuilding themselves\n* To assist organizations with their strategic positioning in relation to conflicting parties, in order to establish credibility and relationships (which can support a subsequent expansion into peacebuilding)", "created_at": "2017-09-12 16:50:20.505288", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 14:02:06.395622", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 963, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 107.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4641, "user_id": 2760, "topic_id": 4608, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Before the early dawn; I was in a deep sleep when I had an unusual dream. The dream \u00a0was about destruction, the unexpected happenings and unpredictable post-event consequences. Along with the rising of sun, I woke up with a heavy heart. Gradually, the day began and continued like any other day. Still, deep down my heart, I felt that not everything is fine and my mind hovered with that very dream. Few hours later, the dream turned out to be inevitable. It started holding reality as if everything was like a replication of the whole occurrence that I saw earlier in the dream. The earthquake had happened !\n\nIt took me a while to get out of the mental trauma, after which I started to reflect upon the past and connect it with the present situation. We all know about the destruction left by the earthquake and I don\u2019t want it to be emphasized either.\n\nAmid such destruction and demolition of the properties and lives, the only thing that compensated me mentally at the moment was observing people and sharing with them the stories and assumptions after the quake. The positivity of mentally and psychologically strong, their willpower and resilience were the healing factor for the mentally wrecked ones. It helped me gain confidence to some degree as well.\n\nMany things had changed and many remained the same. The change in the mental state of people after the quake was a big change I noticed. I am not quite certain about how people used to signify their lives but I am pretty sure that they have learned to treasure their lives afterwards \u2013 an opportunity of learning brought by the quake.\u00a0 The people giving prominence to their beautiful lives and living their lives as if it\u2019s the only moment they were alive was the best thing that came across me during the time of the crisis.\u00a0 At the same time, because of the fear of recurrence of the earthquake, the\u00a0 alertness that people developed \u00a0even in every seconds and in very tiny affairs was worth observing.\n\nEven in my own life, I could feel a lot of changes starting to occur and also few realizations that would take me to a different level of exploration in life. I came to a realization that I had started having better understanding and motives towards my own life, and with a bit more clarity in purpose added more love towards my soul. I also witnessed the level of fear and patience I had.\n\nBesides the changes occurring because of the tremor, a few things have remained unchanged. Even though lifestyle of many has been distracted and diverted for some time, things are getting back to normal, quickly than what most people had expected. Similarly, persistency and hard work is something that has not changed from people's lives rather magnified. The passion, joy, zeal and the aspiration have not been shaken. The most important of all; people have not forgotten to smile and have faith even in the hardest of times.\n\nAfter all, this earthquake has been lifelong death escaping experience for the alive ones and a bitter experience for those who lost their family members and properties. Several lessons could be extracted from those experiences and move on. Whatever it be, life should be allowed to move and flow in the best ways. This is one of the most imperative messages the earthquake has suggested for all of us. These lessons shall last forever in the hearts and minds of people\u2026 Life goes on!\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-01 09:26:08", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 14:36:52.396508", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 612, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 35.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2560, 2554, 2566], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42760, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 8297, "post_number": 3, "raw": "[quote=\"winnieponcelet, post:1, topic:8297\"]can we crowdsource a highly locally contextualized manual of the same level with a large group of citizen researchers, over eg. 2 years?[/quote]\n\nI bet you can crowdsource the content for that manual.

But it increasingly concerns me that ad-based business models for social media networks  are in so much conflict with the individual controlling their own experience in that network that they choose instead to do moderating that is essentially a rear guard action form of censorship. Or if not censorship let us call it a continuation of the networks control of the users experience because they cannot relinquish that control without breaking their business model.\n\n I certainly understand and sympathize with a statement like \u201clet\u2019s make all users safe.\u201c But who decides what safe even means? And from the user perspective, I do not need a censor or even someone remotely resembling one. And in Facebook\u2018s case, I do not trust them at all about anything. Why should I? But I think we all agree on that point. Not that I don\u2019t use it, I do. And I think I know the trade-offs. However I will never find out what it is they won\u2019t show me and I don\u2019t like that.\n\n So again what I want is control over my own environment.

I support those laws and there are ways to keep those environments pretty safe, but it is expensive to manage because you need a lot of on the ground moderation plus sophisticated software for identifying problems and you need parents who take responsibility for their children\u2019s well-being and do not delegate that to surrogates.", "created_at": "2019-08-05 19:06:15.487353", "updated_at": "2019-08-05 20:02:17.790440", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 479, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72030, "user_id": 6183, "topic_id": 12084, "post_number": 16, "raw": "I've been in touch with the Veeo founders.

You are all real urban community experts, massive thanks! Find extensive notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oZTvJyZOIudFwyAIZci9r2n_ThQCl4yNAUgflAtfLeg/edit#). The feedback was overall very positive:\n\n> &lsquo;Good mix of people, nice vibe&rsquo;\n\n> &lsquo; The quandary is that it opened and enormous discussion which made it hard to really focus and therefore the story can become very emotional. [] So in short, if you have a very precise scope, I&rsquo;d be delighted to offer some suggestions. If you are interested in developing a project around this, I would be happy to support it. I can also point you in the direct of a number of other people in Brussels and beyond that have a lot of experience on the topic.&lsquo;\n\n> &lsquo;I could not help thinking that a strategic map of Brussels would be very valuable for anyone who wants to build their own space&lsquo; - @alberto [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/an-edgeryders-space-program-mapping-the-road-to-your-own-space/9844)\n\n> I would like to think of the time periods: how long is needed to do what? Also legal forms, like cooperatives. - Rob\n\n## What have we learned\n\n**First, Brussels doesn&rsquo;t have a public policy for taking on unused spaces.** The situation is that strategic deals are being made increasingly via actors who make the promise to give spaces socio-cultural value. While this happens, they extract commercial value out of spaces and communities. Yannick mentioned that legislation is being changed just now in Belgium. It becomes even easier to start a coop (cvba), which could be interesting for the &ldquo;purchase model&rdquo; (buying together (see below).\n\n**Second, temporary occupations, both long lived and short term, lead to dead ends and precarity for those who use them to make a difference** (social housing activism, revitalize industrial spaces, neighborhoods, and so on). They get squeezed out by intermediaries, but at the same time have a hard time growing them and making a strong counter-offer.\n\n**There is a need for safer investments. Safety comes with trust, and trust is carried, as always through people.** It seems that having someone trusted to manage the deal can offer that. &lsquo;It worked quite well, but then we got a phone call from the company: get out by the end of the week.&rsquo; (@Manuel). @ejjjik's better experience with facilitating a space with private (and generous) ownership in Sofia was very telling.\n\n**And anyway, space development and management that is both socially and financially sustainable is hard to achieve.** In the words of Yannick reflecting on La Serre, Tournevie, Be-Here: &lsquo;It is important to have a stable source of revenue, to keep the lights on. That means you are free to experiment.&rsquo; Events can be good sources of revenues, if you are running a more business oriented space - like Digityser - but they don&rsquo;t make for in-built sustainability.\n\n## What else is there?\n\n**The latest Brussels community effort is [Commune St Vide-Leegbeek](https://www.leegbeek.brussels/).** They are doing tremendous awareness raising through events and site visits. I&rsquo;ll be speaking to someone involved asap, but if someone has news on the practical ways forward for this initiative please share.\n\nThere are at least two other things worth looking into, based on the end of our conversation:\n\n**1. What knowledge is out there about taking on spaces without intermediaries?** This has been the experience of DoucheFlux, Cinemaximiliaan, [Wir Bauen Zukunft.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/wir-bauen-zukunft-learning-from-a-community-with-3-kinds-of-showers/7127)\n**2. What knowledge is out there about buying together in models of say, fractional ownership?** We should be talking to Community Land Trust in Brussels, Timelab, WoonCoop, De Koer in Ghent.\n\nQuestion to you all: is this something we should be focusing on at the next culture Culture in Brussels? And then making sure there is a good mix of people who could benefit from this knowledge practically. Like @Emmanuel was saying: invite people who want to collectively purchase or do something. Also, let me know if you&rsquo;d like to help organise it with me and @KatrienR - dates to be confirmed!", "created_at": "2019-05-17 08:56:21.033976", "updated_at": "2019-08-06 11:33:51.805386", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 730, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 428.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4096, 4265], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67220, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 12131, "post_number": 12, "raw": "I think he is (it is unsurprisingly and scarily big though). \n\n[This section specifically](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual-draft/11263#heading--2-19) covers our core part of making calls. But of course context is king so there's more in there that is relevant. \n\nI'll try to go into the more organizational part now and think out loud a good deal, so again - please feel free to shoot things down. I'll just plug this lecture on [the social mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hwR6vQHiUY) here, that I really like - but I'll try to write in a way that doesn't rely on it. Also when it comes to teaming and getting things done I had a really good vibe talking to [Noshir Contractor](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=en&user=Fqw9o84AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) on the topic. My guess is that I am in overwhelming agreement with his positions (he put out a lot more than I could even read - so I can't be sure). \n\nFirst I want to put 3 provocations:\n1. Good outcomes don't equal good communications / relations at all times. \nA failed team and horrible experience can be necessary for *some* developments. As a species we don't necessarily perform best in circumstances we are comfortable in (and we're obsessed with reproduction most of the time. Thanks, genes.). A lot of things go through a \"if I had known it gets this bad I never would have...\". Note that this is not an excuse, it is a recipe for disaster (and some disasters can be good).\n2. Generally projects aren't constant (neither are people).\nThe communication format should likely change over time to: ideally suit the subject matter at the stage, the individual participants, the group as a whole, the need for external involvement, the need to be inclusive or exclusive, or select for certain outcomes (including travel budgets). \n3. The magic number is 5 (4.something really). \n2.1 + something really. If you look at big (esp. technical) innovators, they rarely come solo. If it was so simple one person could pull it off, it would have been done already. You generally need 2 people with different skill sets, perspectives (and maybe motivations / psychological wiring) in a close trust relationship. \"Close trust relationship\" is probably an understatement of what happens at a cognitive level (thinking mirror neurons, etc.).  As a species we have trouble connecting to more than 1-2 persons at the same most intimate level, at the same time. Data suggests that women in particular could pull off a group of 3, but I'd say even then rounding to 2.1 is probably optimistic. \nThe other 2.something? Those are 3 persons in the inner core that are the \"executive organs\" of the primary pair. 2 execs are not enough (because not everyone can't always work well with one another - too few permutations), but 4 bring more cost than benefit (information transaction cost rises). You may sometimes go to 4 and beyond but you'll more often be switching out 1 of the 3 extras. So you end up having less than 3 extras on average. \nIf this is correct we fairly easily cut much of the \"general\" communication problem down to size: **We just have to make something that works well for [groups of 5](https://youtu.be/3hwR6vQHiUY?t=1281)**. Beyond that is likely not going to work very well with humans. \nBUT we can thus already try to optimize collective intelligence to work well with *groups of groups of 5*. Nice problem-solution pair if you ask me. :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2019-12-09 21:53:11.099454", "updated_at": "2019-12-10 14:09:17.010251", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 615, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 42.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [67199], "is_liked_by": [5, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 43585, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8431, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello to all opencarers.

I remember as a young man reading very similar ones in the 1980s: except then it was\u00a0<em>companies</em>\u00a0that these stories were about (\"the rise of the multinational corporation\"), and now it is\u00a0<em>people</em>. The element of threat in those stories was that multinational corporations, people reasoned, have no loyalty to any place in particular. They will swiftly reallocate facilities, investment and jobs wherever they find better opportunities. They are potentially treasonous, to use your word.\n\nNow globalization has reached the individual level. I myself am a citizen of Italy and a resident of Belgium. I pay most of my taxes in Belgium, but some still in Italy. My situation is clearer than that of most people like us, because there is greater bureaucratic interoperability within the European Union \u2013 and sure enough, there are 8 million EU citizens who live in a EU country other than they own.\n\nAre we treasonous? Not as such, but we do... compare. It feels a bit like when telephone monopolies were broken down, and suddenly you would start sizing up the different phone companies where before there was only one company with one service. Taxes are lower here, the bureaucracy is easier there, people are nicer over there but here I can command higher salaries. We have an extra degree of freedom: the state is no longer a monopolist on providing us with certain services. I can imagine within-EU fiscal migration gives national revenue agencies nightmares.\n\nI aspire to dual citizenship, and am considering applying either for Belgian (two more years of residency before I can apply) or Swedish citizenship (I am married to a Swede \u2013 five more years before I can apply).

I was intrigued by his choice to live without money and wanted to interview him for\u00a0(Making A) Living On The Edge precisely because his concept of making a \"living\" is so distinct.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/fCFe2KnBuJ0\n\n<a href=\"https://wwelves.org/perpetual-tripper\">Pavlik</a> is in Berlin at the moment participating in the <a href=\"http://occupybb7.org/node\">Occupy Biennale</a> and has been living strictly moneyless and stateless for over 3 years. He doesn't use money, accept any nationality or use state documents which sees as exercising his freedom of how he wants to live. He spends his time participating in different gatherings and projects and specialises in ICT and looks at how new tools can be used to change the way people collaborate and organise to move away from hierarchical structures towards flatter structures.\n\nHe first moved away from using money when he was living in San Francisco about 4 years ago and had the opportunity to learn what he actually needs. No living thing needs money, he says, but some people use money to get the things they really need. He came to the conclusion that if could access to the things he really needs then he didn't money - money only exists in relations between people he adds. \"Money only exists in the human imagination - all the bills and coins and credit cards, if a small child looks at it, they see plastic, metal, paper, the money only comes from conditioning,\" he states.\n\n<strong>#moneyless</strong>\n\nAt the moment Pavlik gets the things he needs through sharing. He works on projects without asking for anything in return, supporting causes he cares about. Similarly when people support him with food and shelter, he hitchhikes to travel from place to place, it happens just because people want to support him and what he does. No money is exchanged.\u00a0\n\nHe sees that also with information technologies it is possible to move away from the dependancy on one system especially what he considers to be very crippled and pathological state currencies with all they entail. It's possible to move to a system with a diversity of systems which take relationships into account - so if people know and trust each other there can be more liberal ways of accounting, not really accounting but supporting each other and trusting each other. In relationships with a little less trust it is possible to use different sorts of accounting such as resource sharing or some form of alternative currencies.\n\nPavlik only moves around the European continent and cannot leave a certain part of Europe due to his decision not to use state documents and he usually travels to participate in some gathering , staying with people, cooking and eating with them. If he stays in the country, he helps to grow food and in general sees his life as part of a wider ecosystem. He doesn't like direct exchange - \"I do something to get something\", preferring to do things to support, doing favours for friends and others, and in the same way receives support himself. In this way there is no element of debt,\u00a0 \"I did something for you, now you owe me something\" instead \"I did this because I really wanted to support you\".\n\nHe finds that relationships without the use of money are friendlier but admits that he still faces some challenges, of how to organise things as people are used to using money they ask for money and they expect money back but although it involves more effort, he finds a higher quality of relationships which are more honest and more direct, more based on care and kindness. He sees the use of money as a vicious circle but thinks that by spreading a culture of not using it, more people can stop using it and can get to a critical mass. He believes it can become obsolete in a short time if enough people stop participating in it.\n\nI asked him about other currencies, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin\">bitcoin</a>. He says he doesn't like bitcoin himself, and focusses on a diverse environment of different ways accounting between ourselves, which may include monetary currencies, but he concentrates on a system without them. He says bitcoin as a monetary currency and appreciates that people try to experiment but sees it as something, in the beginning at least, for geeks, and it doesn't look at a larger ecosystem or relationships or what is needed to support certain services and resources, all problems which are similar to state currencies.\n\n<strong>Economy vs Finance</strong>\n\nPavlik sees economy and finances as completely distinct - he considers economy to be relation and flows of services and goods, and collaboration and community whereas he sees finance as a tool to work with the economic relations. Therefore he sees a financial crisis as the system of mainstream currencies cannot work by design but he doesn't see an economic crises as there are amazing technologies, 7 billion people who can communicate in real time worldwide, lots of resources still, and knowledge of how to reuse and recycle resources. There are some environmental challenges due to the misuse and abuse of resources and nature but mainly there is the problem of people getting stuck in the finances which have to collapse. He sees that those challenges bring people together to say that they don't want to continue in that way. Often they can't often specify what they want to differently, but they want to come together to discuss problems and how, collectively, different possible solutions can be found.\n\n\"The way I see these groups related to Occupy and other related movements is that people don't have precise expectations of what we want, we just want to come together and look for solutions, different solutions for different problems\", he says. Instead of in mainstream political culture where the parties claim to have solutions to problems, the people there say they don't have solutions but have certain ways of communicating and processes which may help find solutions. Pavlik appreciates the difference of saying, \"if you face problems, possibly you need to participate in finding solutions, don't expect Papa or Mama to solve your problems\".\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-02 11:52:53", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 05:28:10.718831", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1149, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 120.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7405, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2540, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Welcome! a couple of questions:</b>\n\nHazem hi, thanks for the introduction and hope our web home on Edgeryders is treating you well, as far as you had time to look through.\n\nListen, I'm looking at your profile but there's no reference to any of your profiles on social media or linked in? would you mind sending a link to a work or project that represents you best, something you've been working on or involved in?\u00a0\n\nand can you develop a little on what are your active connections in Egypt?

Maybe someone wants to lead a session at \\#LOTE3?\n\n[Matthias], your book idea, I think, is a variant of the subscription business model as per my original post. Reason: you think like a publisher, focus on producing editorialized content, and sell it before you have produced it. It is financially sound; and it is a one-off, unless you can turn your book into some kind of ongoing paid subscription service.\n\nMy impression is this: we are now in the darkest hour before the dawn. Edgeryders is getting a lot of attention, but people are not really buying (yet?). So we have the workload of a successful business and the revenue stream of a bunch of unemployed people! Unfortunately, this is consistent with everything I know of growth in business (rule one: first you pay the price, then, maybe, you reap the benefits) and with our own strict zero-debt, don't-need-funding attitude. But I am reasonably optimistic that \u2013 if we can hold out long enough \u2013 we will reap the benefits of our effort.

All we pay for in the first month is the server costs of 50 USD per month. \n\nA very interesting benefit of this is that Jitsi can use the Edgeryders Discorse as its single sign on server.

After a month of testing we can see the bandwidth costs and all. It should fit within the budget, unless there is an unusually large amount of calls happening. We can even scale the server if we need more resources. Testing this should be flexible. The included bandwidth is ok for over 100 hours of 5 people chatting with video by my estimate. Extra bandwidth after that is 0.02\u20ac/Gig. The server is on a 500MB link, which would presumably support about 100 concurrent users.

Taking over <em>facts</em> does not infringe any licence (exception: in the case of database records, for countries having extended copyright to databases; but that's not about pure metadata as here). So, no, I don't think CC-BY-SA licencing of content would have any effects on Edgesense secondary data. It <em>would</em> have effect on Open Ethnographer's secondary data.\"\n\nThis makes more sense to me now. I was getting confused by the different licensing terms that were being applied to the different projects. I didn't realise that the Edgesense project was under different terms to the Edgeryders.eu website content.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"But if a copyleft \"share alike\" clause is the only \"restriction\", no issue at all. Personally I like both the permissive and copyleft style open licences :)\"\n\nWhy would we not use the GPL? I can see why you would want to use some form of a Creative Commons license, but in your opinion, what are the reasons against using the GPL?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"On a \"non-commercial\" clause: it is kinda agreed in the software world that \"free\" licencing means not infringing against a use, so a \"non-commercial\" clause means that the licence is no longer open. \"\n\nI've only found this to be the case in the corporate sponsored FOSS software, as opposed to the FLOSS software. The older projects that started before Open-Source became another marketing buzzword used one of the GPL variants, because that was what was available then. When companies wanted to contribute to those projects, they had no choice but use the GPL for thier contributions.\n\nThere were a number of commercial software companies, where they had usage restrictions as part of the licensing. It was a way of reducing and removing liability. You still can't use any MicroSoft software to control any form of nuclear system... :))\n\nThere were other Open-Source Software licenses, that were in use before the GPL was developed, which had similar restrictions when it came to safety-critical systems. While this was a way of removing liability from the developers, it also was a method of empowering the users with idea of being personally responsible for the software that they were running, as well as providing them with the capability of being able to do so, without being tied to a specific vendor.\n\nThe mainframe market has used this method since the 1960's, and it's still where the enterprise market makes a lot of their margins.\n\n\u00a0\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Accepting unintended use is at the core of being \"open\": both the price one pays for opening ones stuff, and the benefit one gets by being allowed to do everything whatsoever with others' open stuff (if attributing and potentially sharing on, granted).\"\n\nWhen it comes to tool making, this is one of the tool-maker's main protection from being sued and/or shutdown. You can use the same CNC system to make food-growing devices, or you can use it to make artillery.\n\nTo mis-quote @Hexayurt, because the price-point of automated manufacturing is sliding down the scale from full-scale industrial processes, to the personal scale, it changes the way we have to do things...\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"And besides, I so far could not figure out what they mean: preventing from selling the licenced work, or preventing from using it internally in a company as well?\"\n\nThis i have never been able to figure out.\n\nThis sort of restrictions almost always went hand-in-hand with the programmers email address, so if you wanted to discuss dual licencing for a specific use, you could find them, and negotiate a direct contract. There are two hardware programmer's i know who were doing this back in the early 90's.\n\nI couldn't get a straight answer from them then either... :))\n\nIt's a question that i need answered, in a legally-watertight manner, before i start releasing any of the tools i've designed.\n\nI'm not against people making and USING the tool designs for themselves. I just want to make sure whenever they make and SELL a tool that's made from an OSHW design, the person who is receiving the machine, also receives a copy of the design docs as well, so they are not tied to that specific vendor.\n\nI also want to work out some clauses, so that if the machine is made and HIRED out, then the person hiring the machine gets granted the same access rights to the original design documentation, under an identical set of copyright restrictions. And this will help fix another trap that Stallman foresaw.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI remember some of the FUD that was being used by Microsoft around the back end of the 90's, where they were saying that every document created with a\u00a0GPL word-processor would automatically be given a GPL copyright license. It was basically another attempt at confusing middle-managers.\n\nHowever, you can see where Stallman was coming from, when you realise that when the earliest compilers were running on mainframes, they had a usage licence where the copyrights of the compiled software was set by the company that made the compiler.\n\nHis hack was to make a second compiler that stuck to those restrictions, but didn't have any restrictions on the output of the second compiler. The first thing he did with the second compiler he had made, was to compile the third version of the compiler, which was free of any restrictions whatsoever. And that's what turned into the GCC. :D\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-08 16:45:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:35.171272", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1019, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14126], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64835, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 11669, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2019-11-20 11:56:23.705616", "updated_at": "2019-11-20 11:56:23.705616", "deleted_at": "2019-11-21 13:44:52.640955", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41817, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8079, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Welcome from me, too, @AlexMoltzau.

We have made all the mistakes and found good solutions so you don\u2019t have to.\n<br>\nhttps://crowdfund.edgeryders.eu/media/MOOC_1.1506ea8d.mp4\n<br>\nThis course covers the essentials of remote work and collaboration. The lessons and the learning materials provide a mix of concrete examples, recommendations and general guidelines for changing work culture.\n\nWhat you will learn about:\n\n* **Collaboration Models:** Guidelines and introductions for different collaboration models, from fully remote asynchronous work over online facilitated war room hangouts to prolonged colocation or co-living situations with your colleagues. Those will help you to become aware of possibilities and decide which collaboration form to choose for which project.\n\n* **Remote Onboarding:** We address how to develop your remote onboarding process for the best possible start. Do not lose crucial energy and motivation at the start. Establish an accessible, shareable system and the culture necessary to properly onboard new team members no matter where they are.\n\n* **Communication Channels:** An overview of possible Communication channels and the appropriate best practices for those different communication channels. With examples reaching from digital preparation and commitment culture to simple hand signs and checklist for choosing the right channel for you.\n\n* **Online Facilitation:** Tips and tricks for online facilitation, like how to use and moderate the chat during online call meetings to help you to activate and engage groups of different sizes and goals. Addressing questions like: What makes a good webinar? How can we have online workshops?\n\n* **Data Privacy:** Integrate daily practices to ensure the privacy and integrity of you and your colleague's data. Understand the responsibility of shared resources and the importance of user privacy in a shared online workplace.\n* **Event Management:** Organise and promote collaborative events in different mediums and channels. You'll learn how online event organising, when it works, can lead to a result as effective and dynamic as in person meetups.\n* **Collaborative Research**: Harness the collective intelligence of your platform to gain insight into your audience and the culture that surrounds your work.\n* **Digital Wellbeing:** Develop the ability to be aware of and balance social and work-related aspects of your and your colleagues\u2019 everyday digital routines. Understand for example the role of cats and other positive noise to amplify social signals in digital communication.\n\n* **Distributed Workflows:** Learn clear structuring and sharing habits for common resources and the importance and methods of open communication of workload and ownership for distributed workflows.\n\nOur collaborations, relationships and world are not fixed by turning back time or by downloading the next smart tool. This course supports you in the conscious effort to get socialised in the new distributed digital collaboration rooms open to us.\n\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n\nEnquiries: company@edgeryders.eu", "created_at": "2020-05-10 06:55:48.819415", "updated_at": "2020-11-24 07:17:26.905883", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 464, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60625, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10971, "post_number": 28, "raw": "Super! ping @inge and @MariaEuler :slight_smile:\n\n@J_Noga I made a copy of the contents of your comments and attributed them to you in the original thread/description of the workshop itself - so that your input makes it into the preparation of the workshop:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them-19-11-brussels/10326/23?u=nadia", "created_at": "2019-10-04 07:08:14.195901", "updated_at": "2019-10-04 07:08:14.195901", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 75, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 36.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [60624], "is_reply_to": [60563], "is_liked_by": [4934, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62380, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6430, "post_number": 23, "raw": "Hei I have cleared data from by browser and now I can't seem to be able to login with Riot.\n\nNeither it recognizes the edgeryders homeserver, nor my username (if I use matrix.org server).

We can represent that conversation as a social network, with participants represented as nodes and comments represented as edges (<a href=\"http://edgeryders.edgesense.spazidigitali.com\">as we have already done</a>). But with an additional twist: now the edges encode semantics, because we know comment 15792 is about, say, \"diabetes\" and \"biohacking\". This means we can represent the conversation in a more complex, nuanced way than either ethnography alone or social network analysis alone can do. What can we learn from such a representation?\n\nTo a first approximation:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Associate groups of people interacting to clusters of ethnographic codes. These would be \"emergent citizen workgroups\" that gather around some issues. Identifying them is useful because you can <em>treat </em>them as workgroups: from a community management perspective, you can engage them when some information or decision is needed that concerns their specialization.</li>\n\n<li>Associate individuals or small groups to the <em>border</em> between clusters of ethnographic codes. This can signal that these people are positioned to make some novel connections, and therefore play a role in generating innovation. A similar argument is recurring in the literature on citation networks, <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11625-007-0027-8/fulltext.html\">like here</a>.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAnd then, you know the drill: how can the <em>community itself</em> (as opposed to the professional network analyst) benefit from seeing itself in the form of a semantic social network? As an expert on (network) dataviz, you are very well placed to answer this question, and <a href=\"/u/brenoust\">@brenoust's</a> Data Detangler is an excellent starting point which we should mention, with all honors, in the proposal.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-04 17:30:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:48.110206", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 333, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16616], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46969, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 8981, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Thanks for the cleanup @anique.yael :)", "created_at": "2018-08-29 14:14:15.642111", "updated_at": "2018-08-29 14:14:15.642111", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 52.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [46966], "is_liked_by": [3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46968, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 8981, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I had the same question and went with the proposal figuring that it was vetted by the partners, but 100 percent agree that double checking is important", "created_at": "2018-08-29 14:12:13.778846", "updated_at": "2018-08-29 14:12:13.778846", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [46961], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67307, "user_id": 5539, "topic_id": 12100, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Yes from egypt", "created_at": "2019-12-11 09:38:28.781585", "updated_at": "2019-12-11 09:38:28.781585", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 13.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [67303], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16837, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2363, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>community building and deployment of ICT for local socinn</b>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Some ambitious objectives or aims that I want to see realised are....\n\n-local online community building\u00a0&amp; deployment of ICT and collaboration tools\u00a0to support\u00a0social/ civic\u00a0innovation projects</li>\n\n<li>Somethings that could contribute towards them happening are....\n\n-partnership building between Edgeryders and local organisations with hands on experience and or extensive\u00a0social capital.

In the words of our colleagues at the UNDP and [Dark Matter Labs](https://darkmatterlabs.org/)  behind the 2018 [Istanbul Innovation Days](https://www.innovationdays.istanbul/) (IIDs):\n \n[quote]\n \n\"We hypothesise our Governance models are broken. We are holding on to 19th century models that deny the complexity of the \u2018systemocracy\u2019 we live in \u2014 a world of massive interdependencies. Incumbents increasingly seek to use governance failure to preserve their structural power positions; governance protocols are failing to govern new technologies and behaviours; decision-making processes rarely factor in long-term externalities; and we are falling short in realising the new economic, social, and ecological recovery possibilities of our age.\n  \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/21fe2d42b1072a34437c7b20d6d49ec2ca63f76f.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"536\">\n\nWe recognise it is wrong to think about governance through a narrow lens of regulation and law. Governance is constructed through an interplay of several overlapping domains: the rule of law; market shaping e.g. through regulation, taxation or investment; public legitimacy through deliberation, transparency, participation and accountability. For us to comprehend and design the future of governance as a method to unleash human beings (rather than simply to control them) we must understand the nuances of these domains and perceive the future of governance as a system transition challenge.\"\n\n_Excerpt from [#NextGenGov (the Big Boring Bureaucratic Revolution)](https://medium.com/@UNDPEurasia/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-d5dc78e53b1c)_ \n[/quote]\n\nIndeed among other apt and inspiring insights, the IIDs are acknowledging what is absolutely essential in the paradigm shift we are in: _the format must match the content_. The event itself brings together hundreds of UNDP staff and partners with external innovators to forge mindsets and tactics in a world calling for collaborative leadership. And rather than design a traditional conference program of \u201cexperts,\u201d they have curated an event made up of Zones of Experimentation (ZoX) to generously invite a creative and collective investigation into what next gen governance can be.\n \nThe Edgeryders Research Network has been called in as an external innovator through our explorations in [Economic Science Fiction](https://edgeryders.eu/c/research-network/econ-scifi). As per @alex_levene\u2019s inspiring introduction [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/why-sci-fi-why-now/9193/), we will be leading a ZoX on **how speculative fiction can help us reimagine economic system change.** In this process (and truth be told pretty much across the course of my career), @alex_levene @alberto and I have been reflecting on the call for a connection between theory, storytelling, speculation and impact. For me, one of the greatest human tragedies is the disparity in the wisdom of the world. We have created taxonomies and hierarchies for what knowledge is and what knowledge counts. Based in outdated social norms - as per the aforementioned 19th century models - these human constructed boundaries hinder our collective capacity to cooperate and thrive. This reflection has seen me spending several years exploring what I call  _thinking-making-living spaces_ : co-created conditions where the act of thinking, the art of making and the baring of living enmesh. Driven by the power and potential of interconnected knowledges, this practice-based research has had to extend beyond siloed disciplines and linear models of learning, thinking and making to shared worlds of inquiry. These have covered stewarding international festivals of ideas, interdisciplinary public programming for open air museums, partnership frameworks with \u201cstrange bedfellows,\u201d experimental techniques such as a public-panel-relay, creating speculative worlds, live-in durational conferences, liv-ing with goats and so on. \n \nParaphrasing a comment by a dear mentor, Professor Erin Manning, from a group discussion at Concordia University in 2016:\n \n[quote]\n \n\u201cTo live better is not to adhere to methodology\u2026 it\u2019s to be in the contrast that co-composes with life in the eternal re-valuing of itself.\u201d\n \n[/quote]\n \nSo now I choose to bridge these gaps by working diagonally across system change, converging methodologies, traversing sectors and weaving alliances. To do this kind of _collective revaluation of what agency is_, I collaborate as much with the policy maker as with the activist as with the shopkeeper as with the ley line and in all instances do my best to listen to how that encounter can offer pathways for collective wellbeing. In this sense, the thinking-making-living spaces extend to global solidarity networks - communities that share an intimate allyship across their diverse knowledges and local contexts towards large-scale change.\n \nWhich brings us back to this moment at the IIDs: how to orient to the speculatively pragmatic space of Economic Science Fiction in the context of experimenting with next gen governance. Grounded in @alex_levene and my background in participatory techniques and collective sensemaking, the experiments accompany the panel discussion between @malka, @Raffaele and @alberto that sets the scene of Econ Sci Fi and offers attendees a tangible entry into how it can be useful for building governance of the future. Considering the mere idea of Economic Science Fiction is so substantial - the economic theories, the speculative worlds, the unchartered waters \u2013 the situation calls for simple techniques that can modulate according to how far each participant wants to go. Inspired by the work of scientist, critical theorist and feminist Donna Harraway, the experiments play across the \u201csignifier SF\u201d Harraway shares in her book _Staying with the Trouble: Making kin in the Chthulucene_ (2016, 2):\n \n_**\"SF = string figures, science fact, science fiction, speculative feminism, speculative fabulation, so far\"**_\n \nWorking within the (enabling) constraint of 80minutes for the experiments, we\u2019ve employed this notion of SF to scatter seeds through the session that might just resonate with attendees along the way. The challenge we were tasked with was to give rise to a kind of \u201cflip\u201d for attendees. A moment when they can grasp how they can use the principles and mechanics of Econ Sci Fi to flip their approach to the current actions they have. These seeds are offered as accessible and nonlinear milestones for such a flip. Implicitly and invisibly planting these seeds through the experiments is an homage to the often overlooked knowledges of those that have got us here and might just lead us forward \u2013 for example: the wisdom of the wild woman, animist and indigenous knowledges, the genius of the neurodiverse, the courage of the less able-bodied, the colourscapes of the bower bird\u2026\n \n[quote]\n \n\u201cInter-systemic change is at hand. More than change and more than system change, the interdependency between systems of economy, health, politics, ecology, and communication is where the change lies. This is a murky territory of alive in-betweenness. The interdependency we are discussing should not be thought of as a part that can be replaced in an engine. It is elusively not in the economy or the education system; it is not in politics or the health system; it is not in the media or even the culture. It is in the way in which these aspects of our world are steeped together in a slow-cooked stew. **The ingredients of the socioeconomic stew cannot now be pulled out, but the chemistry can be tended.**\u201d\nNora Bateson, [\"Liminal Leadership\", Kosmos Journal](https://www.kosmosjournal.org/article/liminal-leadership/) \n \n[/quote]\n \nWhether it be seeds or a stew, the immersive experiments situate themselves in a shared space, animating the connections between things, tending.  Doing justice to the aforementioned \u201csystemocracy\u201d and interdependency of our time, they attempt to open the intricate space of Econ Sci Fi, offering ways in which attendees can orienteer through the multi-faceted conditions on their own terms. **The session is framed through concrete phases for levelling up: < Orientations > < Speculations > < Applications >**. Beginning with _Orientations_, attendees are given \u201cThe Telling\u201d as an activity to trace the relation between the contexts in which they are working and Econ Sci Fi. Here, we\u2019ve chosen to start with an exercise that brings together movement, self-reflection and conversation to give access to new perspectives on participants\u2019 own work. Exercises incorporating space and movement can be powerful tools for seeing anew. Another reason I choose to work with embodied exercises can be found in this passage from Elizabeth A. Povinelli\u2019s book _Economies of Abandonment: Social Belonging and Endurance in Late  Liberalism._ (2011,155):\n \n[quote]\n \nForty years his senior, his aunt vehemently disagreed not only with his account of the location of his risk, but also with the underlying logic of his social imaginary. To his statement that his body was alone she replied \u2018No, that is not your body; that is my body. When you die, my body will suffer and die.\u2019 \u2026 In other words, the woman was attempting to mobilize a discourse of socially cosubstantial corporeality against her nephew\u2019s social imaginary of individuated bodies engaged in private wagers. His language of privatized loss, and its incumbent discourse of individual risk, was not met by the risk of another private loss but an appeal to a cosubstantial distribution of life, health, and social being.\n \n[/quote]\n \nFor me, among other things, Povinelli is pointing to how financialised notions of risk have integrated into everyday thinking of health and survival, and highlights an indigenous approach to embodiment as a means to mobilise against the subsumption of shared life (the case study is from an Aboriginal community in central Australia). Through this notion of \u201ccosubstantial corporality\u201d she presents us with a real, potential, embodied and collective imaginary that responds to capital\u2019s move beyond the living labour of the factory, beyond the immaterial labour of the knowledge society, and into our everyday capacity to live.\n \nBut of course these views are my own, and the task in the experiments is to offer ways for orienting to the potential of applying Econ Sci Fi in attendees\u2019 own work. So the activities are designed to be almost entirely self-guided with open-ended provocations through a booklet, such that participants can create their own compass to navigate through the shared space of the Zone and beyond. The second phase - _Speculations_ - takes them a step further by opening up the dreamspace for what Econ Sci Fi could be in their world. Here, through speculative tools attendees stretch the bounds for rethinking the economics of next generation governance. The task is to disrupt people\u2019s norms and at the same time license their total freedom. Key is to ensure that the space is held in an atmosphere of togetherness, understanding, non-judgment, joy. What\u2019s more, there is an opportunity to gently address how speculation is already driving a large part of our existing economic system (ie. financial markets), and how that gives us permission to reclaim speculative co-creation towards alternatives. \n \nContinuing with Harraway\u2019s string figures and extending on other techniques of mine such as a \u201cpublic-panel-relay\u201d, the experiments close with the phase of _Applications_. Here we focus on **how the speculative and creative spaces attendees have shared can unlock the collective sensemaking we need for next generation governance.** Almost like a mapping of coordinates to move forward, paths to take, geographies to leverage... The technique of a \u201cCollective Ideation Relay\u201d provides a platform to turn emerging ideas into actions in collaboration with peers. The final step drafts a call to arms that attendees can share here on Edgeryders.eu, with colleagues, or simply with themselves to keep the flame alive. Correspondingly, some DIY rituals for continuing to explore Econ Sci Fi in one\u2019s daily life after the event are shared with a reading list by the panelists as a takeaway toolkit. It is intended that this toolkit can continue to hold each attendee\u2019s emergent compass. Their own personalised tool for navigating through the murky and alive territories of the change at hand.\n \nSpeaking of concrete, let\u2019s close with a summary\u2026\n \nThe immersive experiments in our ZoX are offered as a kind of orienteering to Econ Sci Fi, opening space to translate speculation into application. Moving through three phases, attendees are given tools adaptable to different people-types and areas of interest in order to participate to the degree of their comfort. Designed to cultivate conditions conducive for collaborative and self-guided experimentation through and beyond the event, the immersive experiments bridge the possible with the pragmatic to unleash a new kind of probable.\n\n<^>\n\nanique yael vered. 2018", "created_at": "2018-11-21 19:37:08.092538", "updated_at": "2018-11-23 18:11:39.416607", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2073, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 342.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78621, "user_id": 5667, "topic_id": 13837, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<Webkit>\n\n<Config>\n\n```\nsite:\n  title: Campaign Template\n  template: Campaign\n  lang: en-US\nmenu: \n  anchor: true\nheader:\n  image: https://i.redd.it/x5zojh91awfz.jpg\n  social: ['url', 'twitter', 'facebook', 'linkedin', 'email']\n\n```\n\n</Config>\n\n<Menu>\n\n## Events\n\n</Menu>\n\n<Header>\n\n<Text>\n\n## Sci-Fi Economics Event\n\n</Text>\n\n</Header>\n\n<Content id=\"Section 1\">\n\n## Relational goods, stocks over flows, systems over networks: a webinar on the strange economy of the Messina district\n\n<Text>\n\nMessina is a small city in Sicily, overlooking the eponymous strait that serves as the island\u2019s gateway to mainland Italy and Europe. Sicily\u2019s economy and society have long been crippled by high unemployment, inefficient public services, corruption and organized crime. Yet, over the past ten years or so, a small cohort of about 120 enterprises in Messina, working closely together, have managed to build a solid, long-termist, fair, human-centric economy \u2013 and achieve stability and prosperity in the process. They call themselves \u201cthe Messina advanced cluster\u201d.\n\nTo get where they are now, they had to re-invent a lot of economic concepts. The familiar ones (\u201cmaximizing shareholder value\u201d, \u201ccorrect market failures\u201d etc.) were simply not working out for Sicily, and for their goals. So, as they re-built their local economy, they developed their own economic thinking, with concepts such as \u201crelational goods\u201d, \u201cstocks as autonomy\u201d, and \u201csystems, not networks\u201d. Even their innovation is weird: solar panels made out of the pulp of waste oranges? A People\u2019s Energy Company?\n\nIn this webinar, you will learn how they built this incredible success under very difficult conditions, and how their way of thinking might help you along your own journey.\n\n</Text>\n\n</Content>\n\n---\n\n<Content id=\"Section 2\">\n\n\n<Form account='true' topic='12345'>\n\n### Form Example\n\nThis is a form example.

Many Edgeryders\u2019 events happened since then including Spot the Future workshops and community events at unMonastery, so we are collectively gaining more experience.\n\nDesigning meaningful fulfilling and constructive events has always been my passion, and every event I co-organised was also a huge learning experience for me.\n\nWhat I learned and what I would like us to apply in Making \\#Lote is - as my favourite events are community driven events - <em><strong>putting the community first</strong></em>. What it means in practice is creating the context where the community is <em>effectively</em> encouraged to contribute to build the event together. That sometimes means a slight moderation by a community manager to enable everyone to contribute, as every person is different and can contribute in a different way and form, but also everyone can bring unique qualities to the shared context and making things happen.\n\nWhat it gives us is co-maintaining a healthy community where everyone can feel it\u2019s <em>their own event</em>. That includes upskilling in sharing and interpersonal soft skills as well.\n\nAnother important practice in making the event is what I call \u201c<strong>a meaningful Before and a meaningful After</strong>\u201d - like in viewing the event as an open source process - the conversations happen <em>before</em> and <em>after</em>, so that we create together the context where we can support each other in our projects.\n\nYet another very important thing that Nadia outlined in our Lote \u201cworking session\u201d at ouishare fest last week - it\u2019s important that every participant at the event feels like they are supported in their projects by the community and that everyone has <em>the time</em> to share it with others and get support and feedback. So that everyone knows that they will get the attention put on their work they care about and their projects.\n\nAlso an \u2018ideal space\u2019 for a venue we have came up with in our \u201cworking session\u201d would facilitate the community to get together possibly in a place nearby a city, maybe in a countryside so that we could focus on our work and collaboration better, and enable development of projects and meaningful synergies. A place where we could rearrange and adapt to our needs and stay there all together until as late as we need to, cook and share the meals and in general feel comfortable and welcome to make the progress together.\n\nFrom my ( psychological and well-being ) perspective, what really makes the event special is <strong>how we make it together</strong> and the <strong>magic atmosphere around it</strong>. That\u2019s why some emphasis and attention to the community health is always welcome.\n\nI think the way we made \\#Lote3 was one of the best practices of making a collaborative events in practice and let\u2019s hope we can do even better for \\#Lote4\n\nI\u2019ll keep sharing more \u2018soft\u2019 and \u2018hard\u2019 skills and \u2018people\u2019 and \u2018practical\u2019 related things I learned but not to make this post too long I\u2019ll just add some comments.\n\nAlso we are all learning as we are building new \\#Lote\n\n<strong>See you soon in the \\#Lote workspace, that this space is transforming to.</strong>\n\n<span><span>***</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Meanwhile I quote my idea of \u201cLote as a process\u201d description below </span></span>\n\n<span><span>Making \\#Lote4 starting from \\#Lote3.1 alpha - </span><span>Lote as a process, an open source project -- Lote3.1 alpha and Making \\#Lote4</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Lote ( Living on The Edge )</span><span> event is the space where the edgeryders community meet, \u201cusually\u201d once or twice per year. </span><span>#Lote3</span><span> was a community based effort. Making Lote3 has taught us a lot of </span><span>valuable skills how to coordinate all the ingredients of the live meeting</span><span>, mostly via an online collaboration. It was few months of preparations to make Lote3 happen. We have had regular meetings once or sometimes twice or more times per week to keep all the preparations going smoothly.

It\u2019s a collaborative process.

Ima udru\u017eenja koji se uop\u0161te ne\ninteresuju za ne\u0161to novo, nego uporno guraju ono ,na \u0161ta su se navikli\ngodinama(naprimer Izvi\u0111a\u010di).Nije lako na\u0107i aktiviste,  mo\u017eda se u jednu ruku  pribojavaju da \u0107e\u0161 im svojim programom\npreoteti \u010dlanove, ili da \u0107e ako po\u010dnu i ovim aktivnostima da se bave imati\nmanje vremena za njih.

This prompted us to look at regional cohesion policy through an Edgeryders lens. By this, we mean an approach that emphasizes the creativity and idealism of smart communities at the edge of society. It turns out that, if you see the world as we do, a clear approach to regional policy presents itself. And yes, it does start with citizen engagement.\n\nEngaging citizens is a powerful way to tap into collective intelligence. That intelligence only gets it more far-sighted when you power it it with data. Further in the post, I\u2019ll give you some examples from our own work. But before I do that, let me point out that a data approach, in our experience, does not solve the fundamental problem of citizen engagement as we know it. Which is this:  **it is fundamentally unfair** . Let us explain.\n\nWhen you engage as a citizen, you are putting it time and effort to help a professional decision maker (a politician or a civil servant) to do her job. You forego hanging out with your friends and family, or taking a walk in the park, or whatever you like doing. What do you get in return?\n\nWell, you get a say. Your voice is heard. In resonance with others, your contribution might help change a public decision, and that will result in a world that you like better. In one word, you get  **power** .\n\nSo, why is it so hard to get people to participate? Are people apathetic? Hardly. From the Gilets Jaunes, to Extinction Rebellion, to Le Sardine, Europe is full of committed, enthusiastic people, fighting for the world they want. In our experience, the main obstacle to participation is that most citizen engagement opportunities consist in  **going through the motions, while no real transfer of power takes place** . Take copyright: we have seen many participatory exercises, some quite successful in number and quality of contributions. Time and again, the great majority of those contributions request more freedom to share. Time and again, lawmakers decide against these concerns, and [in favor of the lobbies of the copyright holders](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/eus-copyright-proposal-extremely-bad-news-everyone-even-especially-wikipedia).\n\nThis is, of course, part of the democratic game. But there\u2019s a problem here. Ritualistic participatory processes not only are time and energy sinks.  **They transform our time and intelligence into a justification for rubber-stamping decisions that were never meant to be questioned** . Copyright lobbies can rightly claim that the process leading to their political victories was participatory. This destroys social capital, because people conclude \u201cfool me twice, shame on me\u201d and disengage. Many conclude it makes more sense to take part into more aggressive forms of participation, like street protests.\n\nFailure to transfer real power to the citizenry is a general problem with citizen engagement. Engagement in regional cohesion policies also has a specific problem. This:  **regional cohesion tends to view development as a singular path,**  rather than a plurality of paths. For cohesion policies, full success is defined as every NUTS2 region in Europe looking like, say, \u00cele de France or North Holland. The corollary of that is that, say West Pomerania or Thessaly are basically low-grade versions of \u00cele de France. Their success is measured against a model that evolved elsewhere. A model that many regions have given up believing they can deploy with comparable success. This narrative is demoralizing, and it makes it harder to get people to engage. This creates a political space to capitalize on this frustration, by offering a cultural pushback (\u201cthe ways of our ancestors\u201d vs. \u201cBrussels technocracy\u201d).\n\nSo, what to do? At Edgeryders, we have been practicing engagement as  **action, more than consultation** . For example, over the winter we worked with the World Bank to set up a sort of peer-to-peer business incubator for young would-be entrepreneurs in the MENA region. Most of it happens in an online forum. The conversation therein unearthed a lot of rich information about what it means to start a business for a young person in that part of the world. But people are not there to share their views. They are there to help each other start their respective businesses, a much stronger incentive, and the rich knowledge is a byproduct of their interaction. Even if the policies don\u2019t change, participants are still happy with the programme, because they are building their own businesses.\n\nAnother example: we ran the participatory part of the Italian city of Matera\u2019s bid to win the title of European capital of culture 2019. The title was, of course, an excuse to reinvent the region\u2019s economy, as its traditional industrial backbone (upholstery) was being relocated to China. Our strategy consisted in finding out what kind of initiatives people were doing (around culture, the environment, public spaces, urban games, computer literacy for children\u2026), and encouraging them to roll out \u201cinstant\u201d initiatives to support the city\u2019s bid. The rallying cry was \u201cshow Europe that we can be different here, that the South is not condemned to lagging behind\u201d.\n\nFirst, we convened a large-scale, open online conversation to find out what was happening on the ground. Next, we used a [methodology ](https://zenodo.org/record/1059029) combining ethnography and graph theory to represent that conversation, encoded as data, and analyzed it to extract a sort of map of key concepts and seminal projects. Finally, we suggested people could use their skills and networks to roll out \u201ccommunity projects\u201d in support of the bid. We rolled out some minimal services to help them with rapid deployment.\n\nAn explosion of activity ensued. Someone made an [open source solar tracker ](https://tech.mirelsol.org/doku.php/projects:open_source_solar_tracker:start) \u201cto make the cultural programme greener\u201d. Someone else improvised a super-participatory performance in which the city\u2019s street lighting was turned off, and citizens were encouraged to [take to the streets with candles ](https://youtu.be/RXSjEEbChGs). Others set up [the largest Coderdojo ever made ](https://youtu.be/mxd9SlmWrqM), with over 1,000 children coding simple games. There was even a group who walked several hundred kilometers across the region, picking up new walkers as they walked, to [tell the ECOC judges that the entire region stood behind the bid](https://youtu.be/q98tFM_zHmY).\n\nThe system was compounded by a barebones scheme of \u201csocial innovators in residence\u201d, the [unMonastery](https://youtu.be/ABPNRbeQtd4), inspired by sixth-century Western monasticism. Residents were coming from everywhere in Europe, connecting the local scene to its counterparts elsewhere. The city went on to win the title, and the participatory nature of the bid was an important factor in this victory. Yet, the story does not end with \u201chappily ever after\u201d. Almost immediately after the proclamation, local politics took over, as it tends to do in these competitions. Many of the people and groups that had led the bid were frozen out of the delivery of the bid, as local politicians and institutions fought for control of the money. Those \u201cinnovators\u201d, who rightly saw the the winning bid as their own work, saw this as betrayal, and  **reacted with negativity and disenchantment.**\n\nOur conclusion is this. Data are important for citizen engagement. Giving people data helps them see further. A data approach to collective intelligence helps to tap it in a more consistent, solid way. But in the end, collective intelligence, not just \u201cdata\u201d, is the magic dust that can propel regional cohesion. And if you want collective intelligence to engage, you need to enable people to act, not just talk. And you need to turn over to them real power, including that of coming up with their own standard for what it means to be \u201cdeveloped\u201d. In a way, we have citizen engagement exactly backwards.  **It is not the citizens that should engage in regional policies. It is regional policies that should engage with what citizens are already doing** , and provide support, legitimacy, legal frameworks. To do this, policy makers need to reach out to them, get to know them, encourage bold experiments at a comparatively large scale (NUTS 3, or even NUTS 2), and move in to scale whatever works. Maybe get North Holland, for once, to imitate Thessaly and not vice versa.\n\nThe good news is that  **the standards of \u201cdeveloped\u201d need major overhaul anyway** . The climate emergency is forcing our hand. Our economic model needs to change. Our economic science needs to change. Our indicators of economic health, like GDP growth, are no longer fit for purpose. We are seeing a deep societal longing for some kind of post-capitalist configuration. We are seeing a lot of experimentation, from eco-villages to local currencies, to commons-based peer production, to new cooperativism. In 2019 we created a unit of maverick economists and entrepreneurs, the [Sci-Fi Economics Lab ](https://scifieconomics.net/), to systematize and scale these experiences.\n\nSo, we have a major opportunity here:  **encourage Europe\u2019s regions to experiment with different economic models** . Maybe West Pomerania wants to be like Bhutan, focusing on \u201cgross national happiness\u201d, rather than like North Holland. Maybe Thessaly would like to try out regional-scale commons-based peer production. Let them do it, let a hundred flowers bloom! This is good for Europe\u2019s long-term resilience, because it broadens our porfolio of economic models. And it is  *very*  good for citizen engagement. Even for our souls, and the deep meaning of our adventure on planet Earth. Because, hey: it is more fun to be Europe\u2019s R&D lab on future societal and economic model than to be the laggard student at the back end of the classroom.\n\n## You can help.\n\n**Get in touch.**  Edgeryders can support the work of changemakers in more than 80 countries because people like yourself support us with knowledge, contacts and resources.\n\nContact us on [Email](mailto:nadia@edgeryders.eu) / [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/JawU61gzONdIftzzvAyvUg)", "created_at": "2020-06-22 06:00:55.623105", "updated_at": "2020-06-22 06:09:19.985206", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1716, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85570, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13663, "post_number": 2, "raw": "**Semantic Social Network Analysis** is a collection of techniques to convene, manage and analyze online conversations with hundreds of participants and thousands of contributions.

We collect knowledge and practices that people in different sectors are using to keep their businesses afloat right now. People discuss and share advice with one another by leaving thoughtful comments to each article. Contributors then receive invitations to opportunities for further learning and collaboration.*\n\n## Looking at the concept of resilient livelihoods - what does it mean to be safe?\n\nWe used to do economic development policy by adopting a unique idea of what a good society looks like and everyone is supposed to conform to that. Since we are now losing faith in this model, we should encourage peripheral regions to experiment different economic systems.\n\n### In the case of Messina, this seems to have come about by pioneering an approach resting on four elements:\n\n* **relational goods**  (encoding human relationship in physical goods. Example: the local brewery had been bought up by Heineken, who proceeded to delocalize production. The Messina crowd allied with laid off brewery workers to start a new brewery. The beer made there encodes human values of dignity, local regeneration and hope).\n* **Stocks over flows**  (social economy tends to be undercapitalized, because its protagonists focus on getting funding for short-term projects. The community foundation funds no projects, only permanent initiatives)\n* **Systems over networks**  (the difference is this: the components of a system are happy to reassess their strategy depending on that of the others, moving in a more coordinated way)\n* **Dyson\u2019s sphere model**  ( the Dyson sphere is an imaginary artifact built all around a star to capture its energy. The idea is to create prosperity for every member of the system: when a client comes around wanting, say, a consultant to organize a workshop, they are immediately asked if they also need a venue, a translation service, a travel agency and so on\u2026 all parts of the system).\n\n**Over the years and in part based on the culture of the founders, they were able to come up with practices that are self-evident to them, but counterintuitive to us.**\n\n**One example: they have assembled an art collection without buying any of the pieces.**\n\nThey acquired them all through donations or artist residencies. The collection is worth several millions now, and Guggenheim has tried to acquire it, but of course the foundation can never sell it without destroying the goodwill that made it possible to acquire it in the first place.\n\n**That the collection cannot be sold does not mean it is worthless.**\n\nIt has value in two senses: as the embodiment of the relationship of mutual trust between the Foundation and artists, and as a collateral to roll out revenue-generating projects. The collection is valued not for its resale value, but for its potential to grow and catalyze more activities. You do not realize this value by cashing out on the asset, but by stewarding and growing it. This is a very different value theory from the one dominant in capitalism and neoclassical economics. It is an example of the kind of thinking that can emerge from mutual aid communities. This is where Edgeryders wants to be.\n\nWhile seemingly simple and fairly easy to adopt these principles in other places, it is also easy to underestimate the complexity of local differences and embeddedness, as well as of local and regional inequalities.\n\n> \"From my experience of working in the UK, not sure if the definition of wellbeing and safety is shared across different communities. For many safety and security is keeping people outside of the borders (brexit voters). There is a big risk that people are left behind in transformations, behind we are not listening to communities having strong cultural bonds. The situation is complex, there is not the same clarity for everyone.\u201c\n\n## So how can we implement the lessons learned?\n\n## What does it mean for those who wish to support economic regeneration in the wake of #covid19 or The Green New Deal?\n\n*\u201cI am wondering whether we could create access through the mutual support groups of sharing and caring communities? How do you expand on the Messina case? How to add on top of that transcontextual literacy in these already stand alone communities - through more flexible policy making (not waiting for the EU)? Climb the ladder bottom up and expand on it. The axes of sharing and caring communities could be the way to start. What would be the moto to use to find that intersection?\u201d*\n\nNora Bateson says that systems when they are stuck they don\u2019t get unstuck if someone says it, but only if the systems learn together. Experience of creating transcontextuality - experiences with different identities, empathy, get the glimpse of the context of others, go beyond the polarisations and the idea of the democratic process. Lack of trust in society - part of the core things not working. Automatization of who we are. The idea of subsidiarity - top down, not bottom up and it is completely missing as well the dynamic ways of doing policies. We need a dynamic way of testing and designing policies and interventions. Locally driven and context dependent. Forget about the scalability.\n\nA key aspect is that we are going to need to experiment new processes and models for working with movement building to get something to happen, and then protect its integrity for long enough that the desired results become visible. A process which embeds the means to strengthen the political/ideological movements that have supported and protected it.\n\nAn interesting example of what happens when you don\u2019t manage to do this is the Finnish Basic Income experiment. A well thought through proposal originally came from progressive activism. but was co-opted by the political platform of the liberals which then executed it badly - ignoring fundamental elements. For example that you would need to give basic income to a sample of minimum 30,000 individuals (if I recall correctly) - and that the citizens to include should be selected randomly, and not just people on social welfare etc. Both conditions were not fulfilled. Also, it ran for less than half of the time estimate for the experiment to succeed in meeting its main target: it did not bring about significant employment effects (Demos Helsinki has published the [full report here](https://www.demoshelsinki.fi/en/2020/05/08/letter-results-of-finlands-basic-income-experiment-will-help-us-build-the-post-pandemic-society)).\n\nCompare this to the history of Folkh\u00f6gskola ( Folk high schools), a nordic model for adult education and lifelong learning that has been around since 1844. The concept originally came from the Danish writer, poet, philosopher, and pastor N. F. S. Grundtvig. The folk high school movement was an act against a [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative) ideal of both education and culture. At its core was an idea was to give the peasantry and other people from the lower echelons of society a higher educational level through personal inner development. It was born out of a reaction against the Enlightenment\u2019s view of our mind as a fixed, rational machine as opposed to being embodied in the totality of our bodies and embedded in our culture. After the 1848 revolutions in Germany these ideas travelled to the Nordic countries where they were then adopted in the educational model pioneered by Grundtvig and contemporaries. Tomasz Maliszewski at the Polish Naval Academy gives a detailed account of the rich history of this institution in Sweden ([T_Maliszewski-OntheHistoryofFolkHighSchoolsinSweden.pdf](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/short-url/jgK9bC291Ap2XAZgqSVvmXxP1k7.pdf)) .\n\n### One conclusion we draw is that we need to embed the idea of Citizen Engagement as community action on experimenting local development economic models, rather than as citizen-to-institution consultation.\n\nBecause the citizen-engagement-as-consultation mindset is not looking at the issue of power. Consulting citizens is one of those ideas that sound like a no-brainer, but it is very difficult to get the incentives aligned right for. It\u2019s like experiments: the idea of policy experiments sounds great, but try proposing in a European forum \u201clet\u2019s have an experiment: revoke the copyright directive for Latvia\u201d. You won\u2019t get far, because the powerful people  *already*  have what they want. You can experiment only if you can override them, but if you could do that you could also attempt to establish an alternative policy anyway. With consultation it is the same. If the results of the consultation go against what powerful stakeholders want, the temptation to tell citizens \u201cwe have heard you, but we do not think we can go by what you recommend\u201d is going to be too strong.\n\nThere could be a way out from this situation: invest time in the regional level because maybe you  *can*  allow citizens to hold real power, or experiment, if you go to a place that \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d. At the periphery of Europe\u2019s economy, it is easier to get away with things. And indeed, Europe is swarming with mutant local economies (like [this case](https://edgeryders.eu/t/13876) in Catalonia). In practice we need to find new arenas where we can broker specific deals between communities and their local institutional and political actors around getting specific things off the ground. And create conditions for them to have staying power.\n\nIn Edgeryders we are exploring how we can spark and nurture similar dynamics between regional administrations, Political activists and groups running existing initiatives that embody different economic models. We explore how can we give enablers of a transition to a thriving future access to political power so they create the change needed? Can we shift the whole political landscape through tactical interventions and ecosystem building?\n\n* How can we help swarms develop around sticky, relevant social questions - creating conversations, relationships, and ultimately projects?\n* Can we learn from startup incubation and acceleration and create a structured approach to supporting civil society groups in becoming more effective in creating political change?\n* How can a new generation of political actors integrate turn political campaigns towards community building principles - and can we open-source this?\n\n## Welcome to our next event on October 8th during the European week of Regions and Cities.  *Deadline for registration is Sunday September 27th!*\n\nWe will (1) discuss the challenges of citizen engagement; (2) discuss the role of data for and about collective intelligence; (3) present some experiences; and (4) discuss a possible future where different regions might pursue different models, rather than trying to converge on a dominant one.\n\n## This is brought to you by\n\n![](https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F112190365%2F99632995891%2F1%2Foriginal.20200921-191848?h=2000&w=720&auto=format%2Ccompress&q=75&sharp=10&s=4c6111d081a97fbef3e9de5a75d6fafd)\n\n![](https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F112191295%2F99632995891%2F1%2Foriginal.20200921-192535?h=2000&w=720&auto=format%2Ccompress&q=75&sharp=10&s=ddae04130235e560e440da9686fea3c3)\n\nIn partnership with:\n\n![](https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F112191505%2F99632995891%2F1%2Foriginal.20200921-192637?h=2000&w=720&auto=format%2Ccompress&q=75&sharp=10&s=0208f5c34d4c74061bac4586a1ba21b2)\n\nWith support from:\n\n![](https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F112191597%2F99632995891%2F1%2Foriginal.20200921-192716?h=2000&w=720&auto=format%2Ccompress&q=75&sharp=10&s=a15eaa612f132a726ada43e0b1e70fe7)", "created_at": "2020-09-25 14:22:22.047598", "updated_at": "2020-09-30 16:17:06.871002", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1901, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 52.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6417, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41717, "user_id": 3811, "topic_id": 8068, "post_number": 2, "raw": "So nice to read this.

The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect\">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> probably explains some of this. It works indirectly though: Literacy is something that tends to draw an intelligent crowd. Those people tend to read material produced by other relatively intelligent people. If you decide you also have something to contribute, you will often feel like you'd better not be one of the worst of authors (even though for mere mortals there may not be a realistic way around that - as most people just need the practice). That means people who actually decide to write are a tiny minority and probably quite far from the average. So in short: writing does not produce (particularly much) anxiety, but it tends to draw an anxiety plagued crowd. When I read how fairly prolific writers approach the task (journalists on reddit, or academics for scientific proposals) I was shocked by the lack of rigor and decorum.\n\nThe other item I fould almost universally helpful and reconiling is a list of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases\">cognitive biases</a>. For me it very much drives home the point that the mind really is a very messy thing that is quite dismal at some tasks and quite impressive at others.

We want to build together an online platform modeled on Edgeryders, that will bring the city's hyper active civic groups in the same place. It's a timely project since their activity is ramping up in the runup to Timisoara European Capital of Culture (ECOC) 2021, a title which it won. \n\nSimona and Valentin were involved in earlier phases of ECOC, and each is involved in many community building initiatives: Valentin has founded a regional IT community, and among others is heavily involved in Alergotura, a city wide, volunteer led running club which has been doing [fundraising events](https://www.timotion.ro/) for four years now; he's also involved in launching a new space by fall 2019 in an old recoverted industrial building.. ; Simona is a program coordinator for [Timisoara Community Foundation](https://www.fundatiacomunitaratimisoara.ro/en/), which has also been running tech and science educational projects (STE@M ); or idea crowdsourcing and implementation in [Upgrade My City.](http://www.upgrademycity.ro/) \n \nIt is great to see this crowd so heavily vested in offering the city a great opportunity for transformation in a way that can have global connections and our network as a sounding board! \n\nSo we are starting with setting up the platform (name to be found still!) which will be hosted on edgeryders but have its own domain name and entry points (similar to the [biofabbers](https://biofabforum.org), or the upcoming [urban game designers](https://edgeryders.eu/t/trust-in-play-the-federated-discourse-site/9229)). The plan is to then work together to build more local-global collaborations and edgeryders style events next year, as well as a community festival modeled on OpenVillage.\n\nWe will be posting links to the new platform here when it launches in January.

I'm sorry I couldn't attend.\n\nI agree with the opening point about investing in human expertise.  When first heard about this Reef project I thought it would be valuable to have each major maintenance discipline handled by a resident.  I was reminded of the 1960s movie \"The Great Escape\" where one guy was the forger, one was the scrounge, one was the tunnel rat, etc.\n\nI lived communally for five years in Washington DC (1978-1982).  We weren't all that green back then, but we did have various specialties for keeping the place going (this house had 10 bedrooms and sometimes more than 30 residents, including a bunch of kids of various ages).  I took care of the vehicles and the appliances.  Someone else looked after the plumbing, another carpentry projects, one was the food buyer, etc etc.  This works way better than some sort of signup sheet.  Also, everyone has to wash dishes and keep the floors tolerable..\n\nI also think that along with technical know-how, one much have a certain amount of social skill along with a ready willingness to admit when one is wrong.  Living together means clarifying things, usually more often than a lot of people feel like doing.

This is very useful. Also, it does not entirely come as a surprise: @melancon has a multi-year, n x 10^5 EUR plan to make a scalable solution for this. It would be lovely to piggyback on it, but... not open source :-(. \n\nI know I am out if my depth, but please humour me: what about \n\n## Approach 4: everything in Tulip\n\nI never understood completely why Guy did not make use of the subgraph architecture in Tulip to do what you say. A Tulip graph, IMHO, is best understood as a graph dataset anyway:\n\n![image|429x217](upload://n4C3p8K1IigIDIDwJ5ImqRRVyCj.png) \n\nThe same entities (nodes and edges) can be part of multiple graphs, and are *ex officio* part of the main graph. This means that the main graph has no mathematical interpretation, it is only, as I said, a dataset. Furthermore, entities' properties can be global but also local. Multi-tenancy in Tulip is as simple as selecting the appropriate subgraph. \n\nThe Tulip GUI, obviously, is not a web application. But other than that, it allows us to do everything that GR does: discard weaker edges and keep only the stronger-connected part of the graph; switch between social networks and semantic networks, and so on. In principle, we could write a Python script that would:\n\n1. Import fresh data from edgeryders.eu, and store them into a Tulip graph. The first iteration of GR had something called \"forum network\", which was simply a graph DB-like mirror of what was on the platform: user A is the author of post B, which is a reply to post C, within topic D. It is coded with code F, authored by ethnographer G, and so on and so forth. The logic was exactly the same as RDF.\n2. Use Tulip to compute every graph we need, and all their metrics, storing them as subgraphs and their properties. Tulip implements more network functions (like \"shortest path\") than we will ever need.\n3. Export each subgraph as GraphML or whatever can be easily read by sigma.js.\n4. Visualize via web. \n\nRemember we have direct access to Tulip's core developers, like @bpinaud and Guy himself, and that they are very friendly. If we ask nicely, they might accept a gig with us to develop this. Or they might put some of their graduate students in our line of sight.  \n\nWhat is wrong with this?", "created_at": "2020-01-07 14:59:53.876327", "updated_at": "2020-01-07 15:17:16.537982", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 405, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 26.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19856, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 3701, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>time</b>\n\nHi Noemi, thank you for your thoughts.

Our diverse community is made up of people from all walks of life and different places around the planet that share ideas and collaborate together on projects.\n\nWe are a not-for-profit organisation that grew out of a project funded by the Council of Europe in 2011; it aimed to figure out how governments could tackle mass youth unemployment.\n\nOur founders built an open online platform that allowed hundreds of individuals to share their experiences of rebuilding their lives in the aftermath of the 2008 financial meltdown. They also created a methodology and software that helped process and analyse the information provided.\n\nSoon after completing that project, we realised the open online platform built for the project along with the methodology and software we developed could be used for other projects too.\n\nSince then, we have continued to build on and develop our platform and tools. Over the past eight years, we have [6000 registered users, 70,000 posts](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-visualized-a-tentative-animation/13751) and members of our communities have orchestrated some fascinating projects.\n\nSome of these include successfully advising cities on how to win the title of European Capitals of Culture to harnessing our network to create training tools for effective remote work.\n\n**Why Edgeryders?**\n\nWhen you join Edgeryders you become part of a collaborative community. Through structured activities our members can become inspired by one another and help each other improve existing projects and develop new initiatives together.\n\nTogether with others we use new tools to build a deep experience that no small group or individual could reach on their own.\n\n**How we work**\n\nEdgeryders\u2019 process begins when an idea or solution is posted on the platform, sparking discussion among community members. Some join in, actively listening, asking questions or giving thoughtful responses.\n\nThe discussion begins with first hand accounts of attempts taken to solve societal issues and moves to navigating the personal challenges experienced by members. Nuances and the various different contexts surrounding these challenges begins to show.\n\nThese conversation starters can occur through different mediums that take place on our platform, which include: listening sessions, webinars, online co-creation workshops, person to person support sessions and online hackathons\n\nAfter ideas and thoughts have been exchanged, our open source technology makes connections between topics being discussed, the people discussing them, places, projects, solutions and struggles.\n\nWhen we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources.\n\nBy the end of the process, our community members have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n\n**So, what are you waiting for?** \n\nIf you are an activist, entrepreneur, changemaker, expert, hacker or doer who thinks they can change something within our society, join the Edgeryders community today by signing [up here](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login).

We want to apply a core principle of open innovation during the LOTE event setting:\u00a0<strong>We are calling for problems (challenges) of managing community stewardship in a corporate, public agency, or non-profit setting</strong>. \u00a0We offer conference participants the opportunity to tap into the collective mind of the conference participants and challenge them with a task you are facing when profiting from community stewardship in your context. Challenges may be in domains like measuring the impact of community stewardship, creating a community stewardship culture, designing new methods, or setting up processes for community stewardship. Submit your specific challenge \u2013 and when selected by the LOTE program committee \u2013 work with the LOTE2014 participants to find novel solutions.\n\n<strong>This is what you can expect from the special LOTE session:</strong>\n\n- A special co-creation setting aimed at accelerating and speeding the problem-solving process\n\n- Open to organizations and networks of all sizes\n\n- A vast community of experts from all disciplines will be participating and collaborating\n\n- Discussions will be \u201copen source\u201d in order to foster information sharing and further problem solving\n\n- For partner organisations (URL to partnership page): We seed a conversation about your topic and engage people to join it. We log it on the Edgeryders platform. We harvest content with online ethnography techniques. Finally we augment analysis with quantitative measures taken from quantitative analysis.\u00a0\n\nThe program committee will evaluate proposals, but will not provide reviews of the proposals.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Background</strong>\n\nThe Call for Problems approach and the corresponding co-creation workshop methodology was developed by members of the Edgeryders community though over 10 years of participating in, evaluating and designing multiple open innovation event formats.

And I wasn\u2019t disappointed. @alberto woke up earlier than I did, if I remember well. I went straight outside with my audio-recorder and my smartphone, to get some sound and video recordings. It was quiet, calm, quite cold but the sun was there too, and warmed us. Alberto and Ahmad eventually went to the garden too, and we were the three of us, walking around the house peacefully. Besides the pool, lots of tress, herbs, and somebody did some gardening as well. In the background, you could hear the ocean\u2019s waves smashing. Hell of a good morning.\n<p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/edfe6bd8c07a74dc7a211dc6261e1d1bb4fd4b48.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></div>\n<p>\n<p>\n\nEverybody was up in the hour, and we quickly started discussing the needs of each to go to Essaouira. You have basically 2 bus in the mornings from Sidi Kaouiki to Essaouira, so you have to be prepared and time your schedule properly. After little chats, it appeared that the rest of the guys didn\u2019t need to go to Essaouira that much, and the rain kept their motivation down. But both @SyMorin and I needed to go there anyway : we only had two days to \u00ab investigate \u00bb, there was no time to waste then.\nWe obviously checked with @hazem for any needs : vegetables, fruits, bread. Perfect. Let\u2019s go to Essaouira.\n\nThe first step to get there is a 30min walk from the house to a small town named Sidi Kaouiki. And how much did we enjoy that walk ! I needed that walk. To clear my brain and organize it, after the changing plans and all\u2026 The road laces almost followed the beach all along on our left, while we had a rocky plane, with couple of bushes and argan trees on our lefts. We crossed the path of some people of course, but also donkeys, dogs, unfinished desertic buildings, clouds and rain also.\n<p>\n<div align=\"center\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/70a18994fed0854fff46d8aa55e776b1e68ff554.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9bc99e136b0748a5713c9b35b2cbc846c7414004.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c0da96cf4869a80bd710ce18838204676814c5fc.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></div>\n<p>\n<p>\n\n* **_Sidi Kaouiki in the morning: waiting for the bus_**\nOnce arrived, we checked for a fresh orange juice in the first caf\u00e9 at the entrance of the town. Young moroccans were cleaning a place that was like a trendy place to get out when summer is here. Sidi Kaouiki is known as a surf spot. No doubt it will triple its population when the temperature grows\u2026 While sipping my juice, a small sheep herd passed in front of us. I counted them, wrote the coordinates of our location, and watched if the shepherd was there too. Now, the first questions of my research started bubbling: does this man only need the whool? Does he make anything out of the milk? Is there any milk production from this herd? This is the kind of questions that would need to get their answers, but later on. In my head, I was more into mapping and documenting first, in order to know where to go, and check any existing patterns. Anyway, the bus was about to take us to Essaouira, our main purpose this morning.\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/23758d35aebcaf6a580666e3cd93ac9cba8b0b65.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/208388caffd9232f27b21d9a4b6e80368d88002b.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"></div>\n<p>\n<p>\n\n* **_Essaouira's medina_**\nThe bus takes 20min to go to Essaouira. It gets by small roads at first, stops by here and there to take people. We arrived at the entrance of the medina. And we were definitely hungry. In our hunt for a place to eat, we crossed the path of many fresh vegetables and food shops among the many types of shops you could find in a medina: butchers, bakeries, grills, phones and tech little shops, souvenirs of course, ... But nothing related to cheese. We ended eating a nice tajin in a nice hotel (without knowing it was an hotel before getting at the table ahah). Right after that, bellies full and frenchies at their best, we started to check the surroundings of the medina. Little streets, little shops, alleys, turns, going from very peaceful and quiet places to noisy ones in a second.\n<p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/15202d29a6dcc5f4e1bf3bd99bc983eac91a9224.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/ce990f868f0fb6cc45beffe0291a9552962eb23d.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/985760325a204b61cabc5a64a2975b5f2db2e28a.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1964fefbf975f6d88e539e87352270083d6fb04c.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5d9808f069c39286451b916444d8850ac7040cc4.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/78ec55075caff504d0157e8fa81fc76b0bfd3b4d.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"></div>\n<p>\n<p>\n\n* **_digging further_**\nWe eventually met Khadija. She was cooking sardinas on her grill, at the entrance of her very small cantine. The smell was just too good, that was what drove us to her ahah! We asked her if she had any infos about cheese in the region. A man passing by on a bike stopped as well and said that we could find some in supermarkets. That was it. Seemed like all the cheese you can get in Essaouira was in supermarkets. It didn\u2019t surprised me actually, but I was definitely sure that it wasn\u2019t the case at some point in the past: there is no reason, in a region of sheeps and goats, of many herbs and bushes, even grass fields sometimes, that there were no transformed milk farm and sellers here. Crossing lots of small Danone trucks and lots of big brands yogurts and panacottas in some little shops here and there finally made me sure about my hypothesis. Global markets at their best, could have destroyed or swallowed the small productions of the areas\u2026\nWe also went to the port, as the sound of the ocean pulled us to him. The boats were back from the morning fishing session. Plenty of birds, people, tourists also, and this little grill smelling so nice. We didn\u2019t stay too long though.\nBecause time flies. So we ended our afternoon in the medina by buying some food supplies for the house. Bread, fresh vegetables and fruits. Enough for 5-6, for two days. I noticed a lot of what we call exotic fruits in France, specially bananas. Lots of bananas. It intrigued me because in France, they\u2019re quite bigger and come from far far away (Guadeloupe mainly\u2026). But kept my questions for the next day. We were already on that bus for the drive back to Sidi Kaouiki.\nThe 30min walk back to the house helped us to debrief what we saw, and what needed to be explored later. Hey, those donkeys from the morning were still on the road. A little closer to the house, still cosy behind the last sun lights. We also watched another and bigger sheep herd, with a couple goats in it as well. The shepherd seemed to be a young girl this time. They were between the road and the beach, the panorama was unreal.\n\n<p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5065de45ca1b7237d25dbbcb4cf0ab97f7b58a0e.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aa05d077abcc42077ba62e417309aaa26e592901.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/acee996768a0af78b00a848135ff9f202051e7c9.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f564af21248ee7f9dce36e5a4e9cd38fb0444cb7.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b2762becfbd69452793a9a7a4e3d496694ba4863.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></div>\n<p>\n<p>\n\n* **_back at the house_**\nThe guys had an electricity shut down that day. They used the day to clean the house and arrange / fix some things. @SyMorin and I naturally ended in the kitchen for a 4 hands cooking session. Potatoes in the hoven, vegetables and spices in sauce, and some rice. Turned out to extend from pure cooking to large discussions. And I remember my chat with @alberto about our visions of globalism, and how we both gives this term/concept a definition of our own. We were that close from a debate, but we had more to share: experiences, memories, \u2026 And from that all, I learned a lot in two days.\n<p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bc7d7f081f7be8f863a2f5ce5b06653e10b1d299.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"></div>\n<p>\n<p>\n\nAt the end of the diner, I started the fire, because this very ER forum has a campfire, so the house of its moroccan Open Village needed one as well. @SyMorin and I went all around the house and garden to find dry pieces of wood. Not quite easy since the last days had been all about rain\u2026 At last, couple of branches and some old things to break made it ok. The first fire was there, putting a warm feeling in the living room.\nI went to bed very excited about everything.

I'm also the president of Coworking Indonesia association.\n\nBack in 2015, we only had 20 to 30 players across Indonesia and not all were active. And it was so difficult to explain what coworking is and to onboard buy-ins and partnerships from other sectors like corporations and governments. So we initiated this movement and it grew. Now, there are 300 spaces, locations run by maybe almost 200 operators. We believe that coworking is one of the most effective ecosystem builders, as it\u2019s a new way of having a more collaborative office, but it's still your project. \n\nKumpul thinks, \"Why don't we actually collect all of those programs built in the partnerships, built in the sponsorships on national level and then blast it through the coworking network?\" We are in a good position because know who's doing what, we know who's good in what sector because we really believe that coworking is not just the square meter. So every year, we do an unconference for coworking players in Indonesia.\n\nKumpul is currently creating a tech platform that can disperse all these quality programs to the hubs. We all believe in partnerships and collaboration. For example, Startup Weekend is an event started in Boulder, Colorado that gives back to the community programs. It's actually something like a hackathon for startups, meaning that you come in on Friday evening, you network, you pitch your ideas, you get team members, on Saturday, you will receive a lot of coachings and sessions, and on Sunday, you go market calibrations, create your MVP, and then you really pitch to the judges on Sunday afternoon. So just in 54 hours, you can test whether your idea is a valid business idea or not. \n\nWhen you talk to young people in smaller cities in Indonesia, everybody wants to become civil servants because of income security and whatever, whatever. It's not bad that they want to become civil servant. \u201cBut you do realize that your salary will be paid by the country. Okay, the country gets money from taxes. And who pays taxes? Nobody, because the business are not there.\u201d\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t there be a Startup Weekend somewhere in Papua or a even smaller city? It's all about access, then you get opportunity to grow. Just in half year, and then coming towards 2020 now, so we pushed Startup Weekend five times bigger. We trained more than 100 organizers in almost 30 cities, and then it was already run in 14 cities, so we ran like 35 Startup Weekends across Indonesia.\n\nWe realized that if we do everything offline, we are stuck. Only if you can have certain technology that can automate certain things that you can actually make the scale bigger and the impact bigger. This is why we started to do our tech platform. We still need to fundraise in order to really activate the development of the platform. And then COVID-19 happened of course -- so we\u2019re just trying to survive this year.\n\nPeople are saying that the world is small. The world is not small. You're just stuck in your bubble. So then you just meet the same people again and again and again. You need to burst that bubble, to enter other people's bubble and other people's bubbles. But then a place like coworking space is the one that can connect you with the relevant bubbles. Because you can, of course, meet other people randomly on Tinder or someone's wedding, but then not necessarily relevant for your personal growth or your business growth.\n\nSo coworking is accelerating that serendipity. That's how we explain coworking. But then most of our programs required people to meet offline, until COVID-19 happened. So COVID-19 is actually a blessing in disguise for us to really push forward the value of community activations and community engagement, and the values you actually give to your audience in terms of increasing of the professional skills and the network through digital platform. Because now, you have to do everything online.\n\nOur tech platform is basically a marketplace of four programs that ecosystem builders can tap into. Let's say my audience or my community is mostly creative or content media, or maybe digital startups or high-tech people, but I don't have a lot of logistic-heavy programs. I would be on that platform and it would match me with the programs that are good for me. \n\nIf you want to run a Startup Weekend, for example, you will follow the training of trainers, training of facilitators. And then after that, you can be connected with other organizers around Indonesia, so this community of the organizers. Kumpul will also try to put in some revenue projections there, breaking down the ticketing model for a Startup Weekend, for example.\n\nIndonesia is maybe the biggest archipelago in the world, so logistic and infrastructure is actually one of our main challenges, especially in the eastern part of Indonesia. The technology platform we use at Kampul includes Good Drive, Google online collaboration, and Locket.com which sells tickets and also has the streaming facilities which have become important with COVID-19.\n\nWhen we did the Startup Weekend Indonesia online, we actually used six different digital platform to run the whole thing. Some speakers, when it's just a keynote, we blast it through YouTube live stream, for example. But then we need also the back stage platform. Some people can use Zoom, of course, and we also used StreamYard and Google Meet. When the participants build their products and are mentored, they use Discord, and of course, Whatsapp. \n\nIn the future, I think Kumpul will just focus mostly on how you can actually activate a hub. If you want to run something, if you want to engage people, a movement or something, if you say that you're an ecosystem builder, we can help those hubs to be alive, to grow and be sustainable. In terms of business models, it\u2019s about not just blasting, but seeing if can this be enjoyed or impact more people than just the people in your city?\n\nDuring this COVID-19, everybody is doing webinars and Zoom, and it's everywhere. It's like thousands of them, but some are not such strong programs. So what if we can curate and then we can have this as a package, and then as a platform, you can offer this to other hubs as a channel of marketing to look for participants, and then also as something that is a content also? It's like white-labeling certain programs. \n\nWe are actually constantly thinking how we can benefit from utilizing the community network, and starting from our coworking network. People create so much, people record so much. And then that actually cost you money after the event finish because you need to store it, so we will activate a platform called Sekolah. A sekolah is a startup school, where people can buy a yearly membership.\n\nIndonesia is one of the countries whose tech talent is quite low, and it's still also not very equal in terms of infrastructure and digital infrastructure in Indonesia. If you're talking about outreach, we will just touch a very small percentage of it. I already had these questions when we started Kumpul five years ago. My background was actually in program and community development. I was born and raised in Jakarta, and worked in Pakistan,  Zimbabwe, Yemen, Maluku, in Ambon, and then also Aceh after tsunami. So I see the inequality in access, and this is why we do what we do right now.\n\nI think the key is the power of community, and that's why we feel we can activate certain things to make them more equal. I also truly believe of the local heroes strategy. It's more powerful than having someone from London or from Jakarta coming all the way to tell you all this stuff.\n\nIndonesia is just like hundreds little kingdoms and countries coming together, with, 300 languages and have more than 17,000 islands, so the cultural barriers are huge. For example, we want to run things this year initiating a movement of digital startups in Papua, but that's eastern part of Indonesia, where church is crucial to onboard people. We are the biggest Muslim population in the world and in some areas religion is only established structure that works over there. So you really need to take it like case by case according to the community.\n\nAnd then sometimes what we're doing is also very abstract, so I also have to learn which angle and how we can translate it in the same frequency so you can have the buy-in, in order to have a bigger impact or scale. We are the national coordinator and strategic partner of many ministries, including 1000 Digital Startup, an initiative started by the Ministry of ICT. We will also run the startup innovation program for the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy this year, and we are also helping the Ministry of Maritime and Investment. Together with UNDP, they are pushing this. They are supporting AIS Forum, the Archipelagic and Island State Forum.\n\nIndonesia hosted that forum end of October 2019 attended by countries that are still quite offline, still asking \"What is startup? What is unicorns? What is all this digital economy?\" but if we can create this, we can share it with other young people in other island states, and they can do the same or collaborate. \n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n![37bc7a02ea7da6c5578c05f5ec5daaf8051be294_2_1380x776|690x388](upload://sWERRANdZc0cFVUI7ea9sTuu3Q4.jpeg) \n*This conversation is part of our event on 21/7.

Camp was amazing, by the way, and you should go next time it comes around.

In short, it's a method in with steps: increase collision rate between participants by creating venues for interaction and co-creation when they access shared resources, provide good infrastructure to reinforce the relationships that are gained from these collisions and finally map the paths to help the community understand itself better and provide entry points for new participants. \n\nIn this talk, I spin a narrative yarn around the Silk Road networks of the Central Asian highlands as an analogy for community networks. I borrow this narrative and some slides and pictures, from the amazing [Long Now talk](http://longnow.org/seminars/02018/feb/26/open-source-civilization-unexpected-origins-silk-road/) by professor Michael Frachetti that @nadia and I had the pleasure to see in San Francisco early last year.

I have a feeling it looks more promising every day to feed my interest in design/innovation/change and ethics for a very long time to come :) Especially since I have read that according to investors and the like the biotech industry is our 'economic hope' for the coming years (https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/06/07/met-z-n-allen-in-biotech/) ...\n\nRecently I have started reading on the idea that we design things and that in return they design us, e.g. the single portions of fruit juice with their plastic straw and throw-away package (and the same goes for other similar packaged drinks) allows for the knowledge worker to get a daily dose of fruits, stay at the desk while drinking/eating, the straw doesn't suggest sharing, making it easy to also drink on the go, ... etc. even though they were designed for a certain 'customer need' there are more consequences than the ones anticipated a priori - people also discover other advantages, way to use something, ... .

Natural evolution and plasmid exchange also means that some engineered strains can and will mutate often in a market negative way.

Closing the loop is far more important than removing our bottlenecks.\n\nThat being said, the plastic revolution for consumer objects from the 70s onward is an unmitigated disaster, as the long life of the material is completely opposed to its purpose and limiting production on those lines needs to be done much faster.\n\nBut, there is a valuable aesthetic insight from this, people enjoy slick smooth surfaces as they are perceived as clean, this is a niche that I dont see biomaterials filling anytime soon.\n how would we address this? we need to fight the notion that bacteria free is a desirable state.

The most important resource, from any company or a country, are people. The investors put their money in people and ideas\u2026in human potential, not in companies. Why? Because they know the company will never succeed without a great team. How can we expect to prosper as a country if we do not invest in the members of our society?\n\nThat is why we decided the theme of this workshop will be creativity and entrepreneurship. Our focus is on young people: how to we help them fulfill their potential? What kind of support do they really need from us? From parents, from the municipality, school or various organisations working with children, like for example the social care centers? Children with difficulties functioning within standard rules and education might need our help the most.\nOur project was born out of that need to create an environment in which youth will flourish, in this case it will be the Becej Creative Hub, which we will present on this workshop.\n\n## Format\n\nWe are creating a partnership made of individuals and all organisations in Becej who want to contribute to empowering young people and through that improve the quality of life in their community. This workshop and the project we will present during it will be the result of a poll we conduct between teenagers of 3 high schools in Becej. It will be built through their participation as well.\n\n**Before workshop:**  We connected with all 3 schools and few organisations, with goal of creating the needed partnership to and conduct the needed poll within the younger population so we can adapt the project to their needs as much as possible.\n\n**Why document everything:**  The documentation from the discussions are redacted to ensure privacy of participants, then posted on the online discussion space for the festival. This enables us to do a number of things - easily reconnect with people we met across shared/complimentary interests build a high quality report summarising what knowledge has emerged from the discussions\n keep everyone informed about new, relevant, opportunities for professional and personal development, follow up events etc\n\n**Program:**\n\nIntroduction, Who are Edgeryders (5 min + 5 min Q&amp;A)\n\nProject \u201cWellbeing in Serbia\u201d: how to use the platform, the importance of our stories and connecting with others (10 min + 5 min Q&amp;A)\n\nInnovator (20 min + 10 min Q&amp;A)\n\nNenad \u010canak (30 min + 15 min Q&amp;A)\n\nPresenting the project \u201cCreative Hub in Becej\u201d (10 min + 10 min Q&amp;A)\n\nOpen discussion about the project (until the workshop end)\n\n## Who is coming?\n\n### To confirm still\n\nSpeaker from the association of innovators, Serbia\n\nProf. Dr. Nikola \u010canak\n\n**Frequently asked questions**\n\n**How do I get an invitation/ticket to this workshop?**\n\n**How is this event being organised?**\n\nThis event, and the festival it is part of, is coordinated on the edgeryders platform (where you are now) and co-curated through a series of community video calls. We have allocated a collaboratively managed budget for the festival and operate on a solidarity basis. Participants who need some financial support to organise or be able to participate in the festival are eligible provided they contribute towards making it a meaningful and generative experience for all - in the run up to, during and/or after the event. If you would like to join us but are unsure as to how to contribute, don\u2019t worry. Create an [edgeryders account](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login), then [tell us a bit about yourself here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/tell-us-about-you) and we will guide you along from there.\n\nWe @TamaraVuk @jasen_lakic and @noemi are coordinating this event, with http://www.than.rs/sr/, in collaboration with innova.rs, and high schools (not confirmed yet) \u201cEkonomska Skola Becej\u201d, \u201cGimnazija Becej\u201d, \u201cTehnicka skola Becej\u201d. Some people have been specially invited as guests because the work they are doing right now and their expertise will help ensure that the discussion is based on case studies, credible data and hands on experience.\n\n**How is this all financed?**\n\nThis project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 822682.\n\n**[POPREBEL_V01_BrightBlue.jpg4103\u00d7878 259 KB](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/3/31be5dc58dc3089277de7f5cb59f2cc5787a7b6f.jpeg)**\n\n**Does getting involved mean I endorse the funders views or actions?**\n\nNo. What you are doing is contributing to an open consultation on the topic of how to build a next generation of internet infrastructure, technologies, business models etc that promotes the wellbeing of humans and the natural environment.

(2017)\n\nRio, on the other hand, had developed an active street with its fantastic waterfront, open beaches, a walk-able street and two-directions bike way. Future development in Rio is going towards a better cycling mobility, especially cargo mobility, which is drawing more people to leave their cars. cycling tours for the city's visitors are also becoming more popular. Meanwhile, Alexandria had replaced part of its corniche with a multistory parking garage and car overpass, and the city is planning a new high way that covers El mahmodeya canal and totally remove the southern corniche and waterway. The development pattern is clearly going to favor profitable private enterprises and shaping the streets to serve them. That comes in the form of prioritizing car space (parking lots, car lanes, etc.) over the other uses (parks, beaches, walking space, etc.).\n\nFor that reason, I am currently doing a study (for my master thesis) to calculate the monetary value of cycling as a way of mobility in Alexandria replacing cars. Cycling benefits for the health, environment and individuals' expenses are widely proven, but how can you prove to the city that investing in cycling infrastructure has its profitable return? \n\nIn parallel, I am investigating the type of action can be taken from the private sector to push towards more cycling. Some businesses can flourish in a cycling friendly city (i.e. bike trade and maintenance, ground floor shops, mapping mobile apps, etc.). Others can push for more cycling mobility. A bike sharing system for instance can make the option of cycling mobility present on ground even with no streets planned for cycling. A student in Alexandria university would have an option of a bike ride or to queue for thirty minutes to get a free seat in the slow traffic. Safety is a question, but there is more alternatives for a safe ride in the inner city streets away from the major transportation corridors.\n\nAnd more lessons to be learnt from the newly installed bike share systems in Marrakesh and Beirut (soon in Cairo).", "created_at": "2017-08-24 17:39:29.659980", "updated_at": "2017-09-05 15:22:06.407655", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 497, "wiki": false, "reads": 31, "score": 2461.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5, 3729, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13496, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1349, "post_number": 23, "raw": "<b>A bug, mission category not showing</b>\n\nAlthough I selected the new mission category in 'groups', this category does not appear in the title of my mission report, in the hangout page.

Though, I wrote regularly for The Kathmandu Post in the op-ed section, I was barely interested to write something for any website. Yes, I always do look out for a reader and how many of the readers will have an access to read what I wrote? Who does not want his/her write up to be read by as many people as possible? Though there might be several ways and tutorials on how to write, but then, the hardest thing for me, at least, is an idea and its associational links that would strengthen my writing. Only then, I think about my reader. I believe compared to Daily Newspaper articles, websites have fewer audiences. Therefore, when a friend asked me to write one, I was little taken aback both by the website and also by lack of an idea. Some of you might argue that most people have an internet access but I believe that it is only in the Kathmandu valley, where you can find a better access to an internet. On the contrary, the newspaper daily is accessible to several parts of the country and you don\u2019t really need a continuous network or an internet to support what you are reading. The best thing for Nepal and the Nepalese is that you don\u2019t have to worry about electricity to do that.\n\nMeanwhile, after safely securing a job as a researcher in a place where I wanted, I thought of giving a try to write something for this site. It is also a career oriented move. Then, I read some of the articles of this website, and found that most of the pieces are related to the earthquake, and how the country is in crisis, yet continues to come back, thanks to those \u2018hand-some\u2019 and generous youths. But again, some of the points on which this piece is focused will be about how the government of the country and we the citizens keep on forgetting what is Nepal? Is it only Kathmandu and Pokhara? No-doubt the domain of the country\u2019s definition has now stretched out to comprise the places such as Sindhupalchowk (79 VDCs), Dhading, Kavre, Dolkha, Taplejung, Gorkha, and so on. I was wondering whether it would have been possible if Earthquake would not have struck Nepal; whether the youths who are brought up in Kathmandu would go miles with their relief materials to these remote places? No-doubt, I along with fellow 9-10 friends knew only about Lagarche VDC of Sindhupalchok, when the first Earthquake destroyed several houses and killed many people. When we reached there with some relief materials after walking 7 hours, some had lost their mothers, some their\u2019 fathers, some their\u2019s sisters, and some their daughters. While keeping that in mind, I don\u2019t know how long will it take to fit many other remote places within that domain of Nepal? Are we still waiting for another earthquake to shake our grounds or will we ever make a move beyond this dusty bowl? \u00a0\n\nSeveral villagers of my village asked me that was I in the village due to the earthquake that hit Kathmandu and other several parts of the country. I simply replied that I was there to carry out a field work and to complete my study. I had gone to my village after the week of the first earthquake. This particular trip back to my village was very hard due to several things. First, I, along with other members of Students of Dolpo (the organization for the welfare of Dolpo students) started a relief program, and we were planning to visit several places, destroyed by the quake. Though, SoD succeeded to go three remote areas, I was only able to visit Sindhupalchowk with them as I had to rush back to my village. Second, it is always hard to leave own friends who are involved in a selfless action. Yet, I went back to my village and finally reached there after 17 days. For 17 days, I went to other parts of Dolpa, where I had my relatives, and where I took interviews. Though my study did not deal with earthquake, most of the interactions after the interview were on earthquake. Most of them were scared, and expressed how lucky they are to be in the safe side though they felt a \u2018swing\u2019. Amidst those fears, there were also some who saw opportunities. Some even asked me about the current price of the land in Kathmandu, and inquired with me whether the price of the land has gone down due to the people fleeing from Kathmandu. Some even prayed for died ones whilst wishing them \u2018peace in a heaven.\u2019 That\u2019s how the pain was shared by our people when those generous youths of Kathmandu were busy in picking up the debris out of the destroyed houses, and were trying to reconstruct the environment of Kathmandu and many other places of Nepal. While most of the people saw their houses destroyed in the capital, but in the western remote places such as Dolpa, people rarely found any houses destroyed or any dead bodies. That was a big relief.\n\nNonetheless, the historically excluded remote and biggest district such as Dolpa, now the earthquake has stretched the exclusion further. Though, there were no casualties reported, several sites of socio-cultural and religious importance was destroyed by the quake. Many religiously significant caves were destroyed in Chharka and Mukot VDCs of Dolpa. In addition, the main north-eastern trading route between Upper and Lower parts of Dolpa was also destroyed. This route historically was used as a barter exchange between the locals of Dolpo and lower Dolpa. In these routes, they exchanged potato, barley, butter and rice. This exchange is still in use but now money has substituted trust and understanding of the people. No-doubt the historical exchange including socio-cultural aspects is further in decline, thanks to that road. This also affected the Yarsa economy as most of the locals failed to travel to uphill to collect Yarsa via that route. Even after the two months since the last quake, the route is yet to be re-built. How the people including children, women and old are affected by the quake in this part of the country is less heard. Kathmandu does not want to confront its own oppressive realities. It will maintain its silence upon its role in the exclusion but would successfully show its disappointment towards what has happened. In addition, what people in Kathmandu hear and read is rarely about what has happened in these parts of the country and how people are affected here. This also highlights that, in the contemporary situation, people responded directly towards the issue that media feeds. That grief is short lived and Kathmandu gets back to normal. And the exclusive constitution\u2019s draft is delivered and the orchestrated exclusion continues.\u00a0\n\nSo then in this context, what can be done? Personally, the problems are too complex and the solutions itself are. Nevertheless, some provisions are mandatory to attain and operationalize \u2018New Nepal\u2019. A proper inclusive and representative new constitution is a must that would celebrate diversity and marginalized people. Only after that, local elections can be planned and formulated that could cement the devolution of power. Simultaneously, the transfer of power from center to local should be done. No-doubt in these whole processes, local people including minorities and their languages cannot be left out. Every sustainable development activities should be carried out in the region only after an effective consultation with a local people and their own customary institutions. These activities should comprise the promotion of socio-cultural and political knowledge of the local people. In this programme, local youths can be mobilized properly while encouraging and empowering their leadership capabilities. The government should recognize the experiences and the socio-cultural understanding of the local people including women and elderly people. If the Federalism is institutionalized, a stronger form of communication should be established among the federal, provincial and local states that could also introduce and maintain accountability, transparency and efficiency. Only then some sort of \u2018New Nepal\u2019 is imaginable. If not, tragedy will continue and what several youths had achieved would only be a long lost memory\u2026\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-18 17:33:30", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 15:44:46.065178", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1423, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 85.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50779, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9483, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Our old friends and clients at UNDP are zeroing in on cities.

bottom, use more the public space and create creative communities around that.\n\nOur first project, [CriticalCity Upload](http://hof.criticalcity.org/) , was a pervasive game (which means that could be played everywhere and in every moment) that asked players to perform tasks in the public space.\nA task could be, [Hugs 10 strangers](http://criticalcity.org/missions/126)  /\n[Sing a song out loud](http://criticalcity.org/missions/147) /\n[walk barefoot for 1 km](http://criticalcity.org/missions/53) /\n[improve a bench](http://criticalcity.org/missions/224) ..etc..\n\nEvery year we have +100 tasks on the website and players could pick up their favorite, go outside, perform the tasks, take picture and videos, upload everything on the platform and get points (for a total amount of lot of creative stuff to do :slight_smile: \n\n\nhttps://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ccu-final/video/CCU+recap.mp4.mp4\n\n\nIt was a crazy adventure (4 full-time years of community management / event production / business models / pitch competition / night drives / weekend around Italy / etc) and a pretty successful one too, [here is a website](http://criticalcity.org/) (in italian, sorry) with all the missions done (there were 20.000 at the end) by all our players (13.000).\n\n\nAfter 5 year we realize that the project more than a urban transformation game, was a _human_ transformation game: our players were empowered to an unexpected level, we lived unforgettable experience in public space, some of them get married or now they are raising families together and we create a very strong community based on the positive feelings that games arise, like, positive attitude, enthusiasm, lateral thinking etc..\n\nYou can imagine that after this experience (which was also professionally fundamental) It\u2019s not a secret that I\u2019m always looking for experiences / games that could recreate this kind of feelings on the participants.\n\nDuring those last 5 years as \u201cprofessional\u201d game designers we create and produced also various street and urban games\n[the Getaway](http://www.urbangames-factory.it/portfolio-item/the-getaway-2/)\n[Race the

Exploration](https://edgeryders.eu/t/urban-game-openvillage-festival/6643/25).\n\n\nAll the game that you played as a child in the street were street games, Hide and seek, hopscotch, etc..\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7995310134989fe7fef72851b95d9d36c2f99a5c.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\nOne fast way to create a street game (change of place as Munari states in his book Fantasia) is to take a sport -football, basket, you name it- and move it to the urban environment: here you have Urban Golf, Joga Bonito and the Basketball Playground.\n\nStreet games are very successful for different reasons:\n- **low tech**  (a ball, sticks, chalk)\n- **super flexible** (easily adaptable in different contest: street, square, abandoned buildings)\n- **very common** (everybody played some of that as a child and they have a worldwide strong tradition, also younger generations)\n- **low entry barriers** (easy rules that kids can explain, simple goals, fast improvement cycles)\n\n\nI always use them to start conversation with people that maybe I don\u2019t know (this summer I was in a [one-month artist residency](http://www.citizenartist.eu/): second night I asked if someone want to play a game that I knew, after 10 minutes, at least 4 other artist were sharing their games too, and that became also [a performance](https://www.dorftv.at/video/27636).\n\n\n\n_>>> fast forward >>>_ \nNovember 2017\n\nDue to an application that I wanted to do I wrote down a concept for a research that want to explore the topic of street games, but, instead of waiting for the application to I want start immediately to research and work on it :)\n\n**I\u2019ve called the project DISPLACED, and is a game related project that aims at studying and researching the street games and the game\u2019s practices within the refugee populations in Europe and the Middle East.**\n\nEurope will, in the next 20 years, face an unprecedented migration pressure, on top of the failing of the system that is under our eyes right now.\nIn the long term I think that is important to highlight all the tools that could collaborate on creating a more tolerant system and a dialogue platform, I know, games are considered silly stuff, and the Refugee Crisis (or the European Political Crisis on the Refugees) is pretty hard shit, but still.\n\n**My goal is to collect and analyze common patterns and data on how young adults and kids are using games (and in particular street games) in these situations.**\nPart of the research will focus on the use of traditional games that are typical of their countries of origin, as compared with the use of new games that they have learned in their new hosting countries.\nGames (street games)

Rail: websites and apps**\n\nI recently travelled from Maastricht (NL) to Belgrade (SRB) by train on an **Interrail** pass (https://www.interrail.eu/nl/interrail-passen). Interrail offers a wide range of different passes, amongst which a **global pass** that allows you to travel through 31 countries _using only one card_, so no fuss with buying a new ticket for every change of train.The type of global pass I bought grants me 5 days of travel during a one-month period in second class. My journey to Belgrade took me 25 hours, but since my journey included a night train*, I still have 4 days of travelling left (during which I can explore the rest of the region, and make my way back home). I believe that for less than 300\u20ac, that's a pretty good deal! **Interrail's app** allows you not only to plan your journey from a to b, but also to filter on reservation-free routes, and pass-network-only routes. This enables you to travel with trains that do not require any additional fees or administrative actions. Of course, that means that it might cost you a bit more time to arrive on your destination. You can however also opt for a first class ticket, and reserve your seat in advance. Generally, you will need to pay additional fees for travelling with high-speed trains like the TGV. What is great about interrail, is that the global pass also covers travel with several bus companies and ferries in Europe. Personally, I did not make any reservations in advance, used pass-network-only routes, and...had an unexpectedly smooth journey! \n\nI hope this information was useful :) \n\n----\n\n\\* If you enter a night train before midnight, the specific train ride will be counted as part of that travel day, regardless of its duration.", "created_at": "2019-08-15 18:10:35.919815", "updated_at": "2019-08-15 18:24:01.113256", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 311, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 44.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4604], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13358, "user_id": 330, "topic_id": 1584, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Le gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec s'engage sur la voie du gouvernement </b>\n\n<b>La ministre responsable de l'Administration gouvernementale et pr\u00e9sidente du Conseil du tr\u00e9sor, M<sup>me\u00a0</sup><span>Michelle Courchesne</span>, annonce l'engagement du gouvernement \u00e0 devenir un gouvernement ouvert et d\u00e9voile ainsi les actions qui seront mises en \u0153uvre afin de donner suite au rapport \u00ab\u00a0Gouverner ensemble\u00a0\u00bb produit par le d\u00e9put\u00e9 de Verdun et leader adjoint du gouvernement, M.

We seek to understand our current world by imagining new versions of it, speculating challenges and opportunities that allow us to better understand what we are facing today and prepare for tomorrow.\nBorn from the [Scientific Romance](http://hilobrow.com/scientific-romance/) age of Jules Verne, Samuel Butler and H.G Wells that dealt with social governance, population growth and the limits of exploration and empire. The genre soon evolved into the [Radium Age](http://hilobrow.com/radium-age-100/#), a period which saw many established authors, known for work in other fields, exploring this new format: H. Rider Haggard, Jack London, Arthur Conan Doyle, as well as the early inclinations towards pulp SciFi that have yielded our current Comic book/superhero obsessed world- most dramatically captured in Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2019s John Carter of Mars series. Science Fiction writers have always built on the work of their predecessors, often exploring the ideas of post-apocalyptic civilisation, and frequently using this as an opportunity to speculate on themes of colonialism and communist theory. It was nervy and energetic work, as prone to outrageous mistakes as it was to genuine scientific exploration, but nevertheless, it continued the tradition of speculation and enquiry. \nThese experiments lead us to the [Golden Age](http://hilobrow.com/golden-age-sci-fi/) and [New Wave](http://hilobrow.com/new-wave-sci-fi/) of Science Fiction; wherein, the rules of the genre having been set out over the previous 50 years, authors were able to turn them on their head. It is this period of writing that is so fertile for exploration and discovery, and these writers who have arguably set the course for scientific development and discovery since then. It is undeniable that generations of scientists have been drawn to science fiction as a canvas for an inquisitive mind.\nBut where does that leave us now, when it comes to understanding the world we inhabit, and discovering more about possible futures?\nOne thing that is most pertinent to understand and explore are the economic systems that underpin these speculative worlds. Throughout the developmental history of the genre there is often an understanding that even freed from the constraints of reality by fictional and fantastical worlds it is nearly impossible to escape the economics of capitalism. Rightly celebrated cyberpunk works like William Gibson\u2019s Neuromancer are Exhibit A: ruthless, hyperwealthy companies that commodify people, stop at nothing in the name of profit, and run rings around future-shocked governments? We just need to look out the window to see that.    \nWhilst some writers do explore socialist systems of governance, or embrace the ideas of utopian, pastoral primitivism, these are often used as a foil to better understand the capitalist system, or to act as a barbaric counterpoint to the \u2018civilising\u2019 effects of capitalist colonialism. It is very rare that the underlying system that sits behind these imagined worlds is explored in depth, and rarer still that writers do the hard work of exploring the economic models of these worlds and unpack what lies within.\n\nWe have been drawn to this idea, partly because many of us are avid consumers (readers, watchers, listeners) of SciFi and speculative fiction, but also because we find it strange that economists haven\u2019t been as excited by the possibilities hidden between the pages of fiction as scientists have been. Economists seem to have given up on blue-sky thinking: during the 19th century, scholars like Proudhon or Marx tried to imagine completely different economic systems, and visionary entrepreneurs like Charles Fourier or Robert Owens often attempted to encode their visions into profitable companies. This is no longer happening. All economic theory seems to be variations on the neoclassical theme.\nWe wanted to know why, and we want to see what we can do about this. \nWe see a growing sense that societies feel locked in their current systems of governance and economics, but as groups and individuals are searching for avenues to change that. The mechanisms of contemporary governance were built for problems of the 20th century, perhaps even of the 19th century, and are certainly inept to deal with those of 21st. \nPerhaps unsurprisingly then we have noticed that writers and economists are also stuck writing within these systems themselves, unable to imagine outside the confines, and stuck with speculative variations of Capitalism that only explore along thin line, running from libertarian free market to state correction. Assuming they aren't drawn into writing the type of dystopic post-calamity fiction that has grown in popularity over the past decade, and now seems to make up the large proportion of science fiction output on television and film. Where then are the utopians, or even the positive realists? Where is the innovation? Where is the philosophical exploration of ideas? Where is the sense that anything can, or even should, change?\nLooking for answers we set up our stall and asked members of the Edgeryders community, and other online communities to pitch in their suggestions for writers who they thought were dealing explicitly with economic systems in their science fiction writing. The list grew and grew: https://edgeryders.eu/t/econ-sf-a-selection-of-works-and-authors/8582/11 \nFrom this we built a reading group, and invited anyone who was interested to join us in reading and discussing the work. We meet in person and online to talk about the content and context.\n\nWe started our discussion with Walkaway, by Cory Doctorow, which depicts an economy entirely based on DIY production, in the book this technology is made cheap at an arbitrarily small scale through advanced 3D printing and biotech. Production is organized like a Wikipedia-style project. The book makes the argument that reputation bookkeeping (kudos, karma etc.) invites gaming of the system, and is an inferior way to organize production to a pure gift economy (given some key abundances). It also makes the case for defection from mainstream society ([exit](https://edgeryders.eu/t/exit-vs-voice-reacting-to-decline-in-2017/7633) in Hirschman's terms) as a viable strategy when cheap, open tech is available.\n\nIn this section I will draw out some of the ideas highlighted in the the following post:[ Macro, meso and micro- economics of the book; a post by Alberto Cottica, Edgeryders Co-Founder and Head of Research](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-economics-of-cory-doctorows-walkaway/8828)\nI recommend you read through it in its entirety, but the following sections are of particular interest to me: \u2018a way to get there\u2019:\n\n> The dynamics of the Walkaway economy\n> I have noticed that most utopians (and dystopians) tend to present their future societies in fully developed form, and pay little attention to how the society we know transformed into the one they depict. This is understandable: coming up with a vision is hard enough without having to figure out the path to get there. However, it can trigger in the reader a sense of \"nah, that's not going to happen\". This is true especially for positive utopias: probably if we lived in one we would not be incentivized to break it, but we cannot see how to get from here to there. The utopia is a Nash equilibrium, but so is the world we live in. The utopia is a superior equilibrium, but we are stuck in this one.\n> Walkaway is an exception. A near future SF novel, it starts in a society we can completely recognize, give or take the robustness and commodification of some existing technologies (renewable energy production, self driving vehicles, 3D printing). We see the walkaway economy emerging in the course of the novel. Another exception is Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy;\n\nBecause our starting point for this enquiry is thinking about our current real world system, we are especially interested in stories that \u2018show their working\u2019. We\u2019re looking not just for end states, but clues and suggestions as to how we can get there. \n\n> There are two steps to morphing a mainly default economy into a mainly walkaway economy: achieving critical mass and what happens at the tipping point.\n> 1. Achieving critical mass in the walkaway economy\n> The walkaway economy would be a privately optimal choice (at least for some of us) if it were already there and we could just join it. When Iceweasel, Etcetera and Seth walk away, they find the Belt & Braces up and running and ready to take them in. Their necessities are met, and they can afford the luxury of figuring out where to go next. This is great, but how did it happen? The clearest explanation, I propose, is Jimmy's story in Chapter 4. I recommend reading it all, it is also moving from a literary point of view (you'll find it in section XVII, location 6055 on Kindle).\n\n> Debt has been the main mechanism pushing people out of society for five thousand years. In [Debt: The First 5,000 Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years) David Graeber describes the macrocycle that underpinned the societies of Babylonian city-states: people would get in debt in years of bad crop. So they would borrow money, putting up as collateral their fields, then their houses, then their children, then their wives, then themselves. And then many would flee before the creditor could claim them as property, joining gangs of armed nomadic pastoralists that threatened society. At this point, the king would declare all private debt null and void (\"blank slates\"), debtors would be reunited with their families and return to their homes, and a new cycle would start.\n\nThis first step is quite easy to see happening within our current \u2018lived experience\u2019. Certainly there are communities that have already withdrawn themselves from the wider system, looking instead to sustainable technology and living as ways to minimise their impact on the planet. It requires no major leap of imagination to consider what groups like [Wir Bauen Zukunft](https://wirbauenzukunft.de/) or [Earthship Global](https://www.earthshipglobal.com/) could achieve within their buildings and communities if they developments in 3D printing technology and resource recycling suggested by Walkaway were to happen.\n> 2.Going mainstream: the tipping point in the walkaway economy\n> The process of growth of the walkaway society is nonlinear. Like most diffusion processes, it follows a S-shape curve: a long period of slow growth, then a dramatic acceleration when almost everyone adopts it, then a slow process of decay of the last remaining default strongholds. The period of dramatic acceleration seems to be pushed by three factors.\n> The walkaway society (with its underpinning economy) has reached an attractive scale. This is shown in Chapter 6. Walkaways are reclaiming cities drowned by climate change or extreme pollution, turning them into viable habitats for people \"for whom society has no use\". They are very well organized: they have solarpunk transport systems like slow trains, zeppelins, and ultra-ultralight bicycles. They have house AIs and consciousness upload.\n> Default society is becoming ever more harsh, with more extreme inequality and fewer opportunities for the rest of us. \n>>Nadie: \"There isn\u2019t going to be default world and walkaway world trading people forever. When you have big rich people, and everyone else poor as poor, the result is \u2026 unstable.\"\n\n> Slow growth has reached the point where almost everyone has close friends or relatives in walkaway. At this point, network effects kick in, making it much easier for people to walk away than it had been for Jimmy. We see this happening in real time at the confrontation between default security and the freed inmates at Kingston prison, in Chapter 6:\n>> \u201cIt turned on graph theory: once you hit a critical mass of walkaways, the six-degrees thing meant every single rent-a-cop on the line was no more than two handshakes\u2014or family Christmas dinners\u2014away from a walkaway who would shame and sweet-talk them into putting down their weapons.\u201d\n\n> \"The six-degrees thing\" refers to [Stanley Milgram's small world experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_experiment), a landmark result in network science. Political scientist Michael Chwe has a more formal treatment of how social network structure influences the possibility of successful collective action in this [paper](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/210269) (recommended).\n \nAfter Walkaway followed Autonomous by Annalee Newitz, another book released in the past 18 months.\n\nAutonomous, by Annalee Newitz. It's a far future, earth-bound scenario with advanced biotech, under a corporate rulership primarily powered by extreme intellectual property rights. She goes deep in the debate between master-servant relationships, as the world features both classic human indebted servitude and autonomous artificially intelligent robots as well as into piracy, open knowledge, addiction and freedom.\nAutonomous is mostly a meditation on freedom. The economy of its world, while more developed than you would find in most SF, is not a central consideration for Newitz. Additionally, what economics we can glimpse in the book is not fundamentally different from the advanced capitalist system we live in. In this sense, Autonomous is very different from Doctorow's Walkaway.\nAgain i would recommend reading the post on the [relevant economic sections in full](https://edgeryders.eu/t/second-reading-group-meeting-info-and-cheatsheet-on-autonomous-by-annalee-newitz/9051), but I have drawn the central ideas out here:\n>There are two original, well developed differences between our economy and that of Autonomous: an overdeveloped, encroaching patent system, and indentured labor.\n1. Intellectual property rights\nAutonomous runs on a capitalist knowledge economy. Pharmaceutical companies make money like they do in our world: they invent and market drugs. A lot of their business seems to be not so much in curing illnesses as in upgrading humans: life extension drugs, intelligence enhancing drugs, productivity drugs etc. The business model is based on patenting molecules and licensing out the right to manufacture them, like in our world. However, the system has degenerated. Copyright law is extremely severe; its enforcement is the responsibility of the International Property Coalition (IPC), which appears to be a treaty organization. IPC is allowed to maim and kill to repress patent violation, and it overrides national regulation:\nEconomically, patents are legal monopolies. Economists normally dislike monopolies, because they can be proven to be inefficient. The argument for granting temporary monopolies over knowledge is that they put in place incentives to innovation and creation. However, there is a tendency for the regulation on copyright to be extended so that it allows rent extraction, i.e. economic activities that appropriate value rather than creating it. Three ways that this happens are: the extension of the duration of copyright protection (from 14 years to 70 years after the death of the original inventor or creator); \"upstream\" patenting (patenting building blocks of technology and creation, like the alphabet, or the wheel); patenting inventions resulting from publicly funded research. A recent critique of \"excess copyright\" in economics is found in Mariana Mazzucato's The value of everything1. Clay Shirky argues that copyright holders aim to\nraise the cost of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability to amateurs.\nIn the world of Autonomous excessive copyright protection affects access to advanced medical care. Since \"advanced medical care\" is mostly about upgrading humans, copyright laws end up driving large and persistent inequalities.\nAlmost all the \"good guys\" in Autonomous are copyright opposers; free culture/open knowledge activists like Krish, or downright pirates like Jack and Frankie. And yet, Newitz does not offer a reflection on free culture as an economic model, and is rather fascinated by their cultural expression (parties, body mods etc.)\n2. Indentured and non-indentured labor\nIndentured labor starts with the emergence of machine self-awareness and \"human-level intelligence\". When this happens, society decides that intelligent machines should be indentured to their creators, who can then sell their right over them. Paladin finds this out while visiting a museum dedicated to bot history.\nIndenture of intelligent robots is justified with an economic argument: it gives manufacturers the incentive to make them.\nIn Autonomous, bots are created as valuable resources. They are law enforcers (Paladin, Fang), researchers (Med, Actin), culture workers (Bug), and of course sex workers. There is not much talk of automation taking working class jobs. Working class jobs, it seems, are worked by indentured humans.\n\nWe agreed that Autonomous was more interested in exploring political economics than the pure economics that drive the day-to-day economy of her world. But that within this still lies an interesting proposition. Anique  argues that > \u201cone of the opportunities that comes with the challenge of our current failing economic system is to reclaim economics all together. With a tighter and tighter hold by capital, comes more creative innovations to release ourselves from it. For example, I'm interested in future economic scenarios that reframe value, that are not only based on quantitative ledgers but also qualitative accounts - think from I-owe-you to this-was-created-here.\u201d She draws on the work of  Brian Massumi ([99 Theses on the Revaluation of Value](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/99-theses-on-the-revaluation-of-value)) \"it is time to reclaim value from the capitalist market and the neoliberal reduction of life to \u201chuman capital\u201d\u2014time to occupy surplus-value for a postcapitalist future.\" (For a longer taste, see this [blog post](http://www.uminnpressblog.com/2018/09/occupy-surplus-value-toward-revaluation.html)).\n\nSo what is our process for the next few weeks, and how does our EconSciFi research continue to develop?\nWe are very happy that we have secured both of our participants to take part in [UNDP Next Gen Gov](https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-39ccc3a6c9f8) event in Istanbul. We\u2019ve been working with our hosts to create an \n> \u201cexperimentation space that will \u2026 bring together professional economists, entrepreneurs experimenting with enterprise-scale economic models, civic and cultural leaders working with new socio-economic systems and sci-fi writers to discuss and to start teasing out possible new economic operating models beyond current governance constraints. Currently hiding within the pages of popular culture and less visible cultural spaces, they will be exposing them to the harsh light of modern economic theory, as well as to a broader enquiry that looks at melding ecological impacts with new forms of energy and other production, and embodying principles of just governance and integrity in decision making. What works? What\u2019s really new? How do we make the fiction into reality? Participatory experiments in collective sensemaking, speculation and co-creation will open spaces for the 2018 IID to consider how these economic science fictions might unfold in the real-world contexts of interest.\u201d\n\n[Malka Older](https://malkaolder.wordpress.com/), author of the Centennial Cycle (Infomocracy, Null States, State Tectonics) is a writer, aid worker, and PhD candidate. Named Senior Fellow for Technology and Risk at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs for 2015, she has more a decade of experience in humanitarian aid and development, ranging from field level experience as a Head of Office in Darfur to supporting global programs and agency-wide strategy as a disaster risk reduction technical specialist.\nMalka will be our \u2018avatar of the genre\u2019, speaking both about her own work and the work of other SF authors in this field.\nJoining the discussion will be [Raffaele Miniaci](https://sites.google.com/site/rafminiaci/home/cv), a full professor of Economics at University of Brescia, in Italy. His research has been mostly on labor economics issues. He comes to economics from statistics, so his work has always been strongly quantitative and data-oriented. He has a unique ability to map abstract ideas and concepts (like \"inequality\" or \"abundance\") onto the messiness of actual economies, populated by brilliant, imperfect actual humans and their creations. How do you measure things? How does choosing to measure something shift what you are trying to do? How will you know you are doing it right? \n\nAs we move into blue-sky speculation, we think Econ-SF needs just that: someone with at least some idea of where to begin answering the question \"how would it work in practice\"?\n\nAlongside the discussion and learning that will come from both of these participants Anique and I are working on some participatory elements. We\u2019re particularly drawn to how we can lead people engaging with the central topic towards real life application, scoping out possible tools, techniques and speculations that we can use on the day. Alongside this we are considering how we can bring in local partners from around the area to provide some \u2018on the ground\u2019 lived experience of how these next steps may already exist.\nIf you want to join in the discussion and help frame the direction of travel then please visit the discussion [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/did-you-say-speculations-participatory-programming-for-econ-sci-fi-in-istanbul/9037).\n\nFrom a personal level the next step for me will be to write another piece about what it is that specifically draws me to this subject. Part provocation, part exploration i will be setting out some of the things i hope we can achieve by looking more deeply into this area.

This idea to start a company came about as the contract for [the Node](https://www.noden.community/), a quite radical community space that I'm on the board of and started the foundation for, will run out early 2019 as the building it's in is coming down. However, the Node being an idealistic non-profit project, could not bear the costs of renting a space large enough to continue as before. Our old contract was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that came about from some very fortunate circumstances. Our choice was between either going much smaller at the next Node, making the Node more professional, or to create a holding shell around it with in which multiple entities could use the space. \n\nWe also knew that even with a low rent, the Node project has always been reliant on a small group of people putting in extreme amounts of unpaid work, and that this would not be sustainable in the long run. This has been especially true for my friend Hampus Lindblad, who founded the Node and has worked countless unpaid hours for it, sometimes paying for it out of his own pocket for us to make ends meet. It's been somewhat of a personal mission of mine for the last few years to figure out how to pay him some nominal sum per month before he burns through his savings completely. \n\nBuilding a company which could actually run a large space with enough of a surplus to pay some people part time for servicing and maintaining the house would build resilience. That's the route we opted for with Blivande, and though we won't be able to pay anyone in the first year, it should be possible in the second year as we build liquidity and start taking in more events, seminars and conferences to the space. Working for Blivande probably won't pay me anything in 2019, but neither does the Borderland or the Node. My work for Blivande is to lay out a strategy to make sure we can make ends meet for the first three years. \n\n## What will happen at Blivande\n\n[In the presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRevhJnN1FaoeWuiocVOcjZ63KAvzzi7s9O6pO68N62BQQXRXTsOUs6pFWmYPeoQ8ayAPPUPd9flR7M/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=10000&slide=id.g3f9a6951a7_0_120), we go through in some detail what will happen in the house.\n\n* **Studio Tau**\n\n    Studio Tau is the art studio, workshop and makerspace of \u03b2livande, equipped for artists and makers. Membership based at different tiers.\n\n* **Transforma**\n\n    Project of the Node association funded by a 1 million SEK art grant which will own equipment and tools at Tau and hold courses in arts and crafts. This also pays some salary for Hampus Lindblad during 2019. Transforma is a separate entity from Blivande and it\u2019s Studio Tau, and rents space to hold hackathon and courses at Tau.\n\n* **Studio Beta**\n\n   Co-working space on the second floor for up to 25 people, and the membership to also gives access to Studio Tau. We're aiming to be as selective as our cash flow allows us to be in choosing who we bring in to Studio Beta to create a community of peers with synergies between each others work, rather than an office. People that are actually likely to use their access to Studio Tau and go to workshops at the Node in the evening are given priority.\n\n* **The Node**\n\n    Biggest single tenant of Blivande, and pays about 25% of the total rent while holding 45% of the space between 18:00 and midnight on weekdays and every other weekend. At other times, Blivande uses the space.\n\n* **Blivande Events**\n\n   We aim to create a unique space for events. We've seen at the Node that there is demand for spaces that feel creative and different. We're aiming to host everything from daytime conferences and seminars to all night parties (we have a permit with our landlord to even host small club events until 5 AM in the morning if we want to) in the Node space, which we can use for the Blivande company during daytime and every other weekend.\n\n* **External events**\n\n    Renting the space out for events arranged by others has been a steady source of income at the Node, and we think it will be at Blivande too. We've had the Node rented for everything from theatre performances and concerts to birthday parties and large dinners.\n\n\n## I want to bring Edgeryders in\n\nDet Blivande Huset is where I'll be spending a lot of my time in 2019, working on things like [Particip.io](https://edgeryders.eu/t/particip-io-software-for-participatory-culture/8928) and anything else I might start with Edgeryders Nordic, as well as any work I might to for the POPREBEL or NGI projects. We have also [talked about hosting the next LOTE in Stockholm](https://edgeryders.eu/t/notes-from-call-on-02-07/8821/22?u=hugi) and there could also be an opportunity to use the house for events relating to NGI. \n\nI would like to ask weather Edgeryders could invest renting space in the house for the Edgeryders Nordic branch in Stockholm, much like is done for the Reef in Brussels. What I'm proposing more specifically is this:\n\nEdgeryders would have an arrangement with Blivande to have access to office space for up to three people at Studio Beta, and Blivande will supply office equipment (including monitors for up to two people and printer access) and maintenance. Essentially, this means that Edgeryders pays for the equivalent of a fixed desk at the house, which I will be using, with room for two others whenever necessary. \n\nEdgeryders will also be entitled to 5 full days per year to run its own events in the Blivande Event space on the 1st floor, including technical and event production work from Blivande (meaning that Hampus or someone else would be there to help out with AV, decorations and cleaning afterwards). Further events would be arranged at a discounted rate.\n\nI'm asking for Edgeryders to sign a contract with Blivande for one year, for a total of 100.000 SEK, starting January 2019. This is equivalent to three seats (3000 SEK per month per seat) at Studio Beta. These are open to any Edgeryder working on ER stuff (as long as I'm given some heads up with a ping on the platform or the Riot), which is usually not the case as memberships are personal. Standard full day event rates with support will be at about 15.000 SEK, which means that 5 days would be worth 75.000. This could go towards LOTE or anything else we would like to do at the house. This location would be to Edgeryders Nordic what the Reef is to Edgeryders in Brussels. And incidentally, this amount is also smaller than what Edgeryders Nordic will generate in for the overhead account through the Particip.io project.

Others browse what others have posted and leave thoughtful comments when they find one that interests them. \n\n**Every week the Edgeryders community managers host a video chat where participants discuss what the community members have all been thoughtfully writing about on the online forum.** This is a kind of virtual cafe where those who have already been part of those discussions can drop in to meet face-to-face. In order to reflect on how to build on what has been learned so far over a cup of coffee. \n\n**Those who might be new to it but interested, and would like to get involved more directly also find this a nice and easy way to get to know who and what is happening** - and how they can get started. \n\nThose calls take place every Tuesday from 18:00 to 19:00 CET (Brussels time) \n\n\n        \n        Sep 24, 2019 06:00 PM\n        Oct 1, 2019 06:00 PM\n        Oct 8, 2019 06:00 PM\n        Oct 15, 2019 06:00 PM\n        Oct 22, 2019 06:00 PM\n        Oct 29, 2019 06:00 PM\n        Nov 5, 2019 06:00 PM\n        Nov 12, 2019 06:00 PM\n        Nov 19, 2019 06:00 PM\n        Nov 26, 2019 06:00 PM\n        Dec 3, 2019 06:00 PM\n        Dec 10, 2019 06:00 PM\n        Dec 17, 2019 06:00 PM\n     \n   _Download a [Calendar Reminder here.](https://zoom.us/meeting/uZwkfu6pqT0vVYoNECnUgDF3EfwNQ2Fjhg/ics?icsToken=757857ca0fc7fcef188e37ab8885d4d8e33aa7d15bf76d44766b3680df83f698)_\n<br>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n# How to to Join community video chat: \n\nIt is easy, at the right time (any Tuesday at 19:00 CET (Brussels time) click on this link\nhttps://zoom.us/j/489971765\n\n_(download [Calendar Reminder here](https://zoom.us/meeting/uZwkfu6pqT0vVYoNECnUgDF3EfwNQ2Fjhg/ics?icsToken=757857ca0fc7fcef188e37ab8885d4d8e33aa7d15bf76d44766b3680df83f698))_\n\nLooking forward to seeing you during the next call!", "created_at": "2019-06-30 21:32:45.137403", "updated_at": "2019-09-23 09:57:47.472440", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 426, "wiki": false, "reads": 37, "score": 492.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2915, 4795], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34273, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6692, "post_number": 3, "raw": "@matthias when were you planning on heading down again?", "created_at": "2017-08-11 11:27:43.229403", "updated_at": "2017-08-11 11:27:43.229403", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 24.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [34272], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81044, "user_id": 3456, "topic_id": 13926, "post_number": 19, "raw": "It needs to be a post request like `curl -X POST` - then it shall work.", "created_at": "2020-07-27 18:32:33.371101", "updated_at": "2020-07-27 18:32:33.371101", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [81042], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76368, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 13448, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Yes, Parvis is the place, especially when it's sundrenched during summer afternoons :-)", "created_at": "2020-05-12 09:04:06.502898", "updated_at": "2020-05-12 09:04:06.502898", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 28.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [76219], "is_liked_by": [428], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68882, "user_id": 6080, "topic_id": 7122, "post_number": 54, "raw": "Hi, I just started folding the machine, I'm tossing the first pictures in the link.\nHigh quality \nhttps://github.com/Mialeks/sorter/blob/master/IMG_20200117_155952.jpg\nThe whole is based on an aluminum profile 10mm x 20mm, a few screws, a conveyor belt printed from TPU, and elements printed from PET-G, roller bearings.\nI can make STL files available, but they are not yet perfected,\nWhen I add the upper tape and finish the whole thing, I'll share the film.\nI've designed everything myself, and I can rewrite everything as required.", "created_at": "2020-01-17 15:33:13.870717", "updated_at": "2020-01-17 15:33:13.870717", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 95, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 64.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [68195], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77287, "user_id": 4861, "topic_id": 13597, "post_number": 8, "raw": "[quote=\"MariaEuler, post:1, topic:13466\"]\n**I would like to invite your perspective on this issue in the context of open source and the issue of \u201cmaking a living\u201d.**\n\n* Have you experienced examples of that?\n* Do you think this is an important issue?\n* How would you like to solve this?\n* How can we find an appropriate value system for value-creating work?\n[/quote]\n\nI am not sure if that really is an issue (and I guess the book has real numbers about it).

Sander is a Santa Fe Institute professor, and the Dean of the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University. He is interdisciplinary to an extent that would make most people seasick, and make most academic recoil in horror. Watch [this video on the archaeology of innovation](http://longnow.org/seminars/02009/nov/18/long-and-short-it/) and prepare to have your mind blown to bits (the interviewer is Stewart Brand \u2013 just saying). \n\nWe agreed Sander would come on board on the Edgeryders team working on POPREBEL. He will have a wizardly role: no deliverables or anything like this. He will help us set us a sort of digital ethnography skunkworks: explore together wild, \"out there\" possible directions for research, from a complex systems perspective. We will start out by organizing a small (< 10 people) two-days seminar in March. Having one-two such seminars a year might be the way to go.\n\nWhere does this go? It will keep POPREBEL on its toes; and, hopefully, it will lead to some future proposal, more advanced and radical than POPREBEL itself, and anything we are doing now.\n\nSander, a European by birth with an American affiliation, is in Europe to lead a brand new foundation started by ASU and Uni Louisiana to do research in Europe, funded by the EU. This kind of complex systems-inspired, high quality, high interdisciplinarity research is part of ASU's long term strategy in Europe and elsewhere.

For high school students, they will be mainly studying or discussing just high school events. \n\nyou can work,study or just relax in the space.\n\n\n**khawla**  I would love to know Why people come to the space ? not who comes then. \n\n**Yosser** : because you don't have a space that you can just sit and work or study , you only have coffee shops for men and the new ones for men and women are very noisy , so people who come want to run away from  the noise and work and discuss project. \n\n**Khawla** and where exaclty is the space located ?\n\n**Yosser** : It is in the city , about 15 minutes walking  from the center.\n\n## How to move forward, learning from Elspace\n\n\n**Khwala** : I want to share with you how we approach stuff in our community, there are mainly 2 approaches.\n\n1. mainstream activities that we need to have all the time specially for the freelancer \u2026.......... so when we are talking about freelancer I recommend to see for the 4 month you have the useers and  make a profile for your own freelancer profile and start crafting the service based on their needs. You can approach the freelancers and ask them  what they need and highlight it as a services, this is the 1st mainstream for your space.\n\n1. The high school and NGOs I would recommend to come from your mission and value for your space , what do you want and what character you want to build and start making activities around this.\n\n**Yosser** : I wanted to share with  you , I was in the 1st coworking space launched in Medenine ,and  both of us are facing the same problem , the concept of freelancing is not known , everything is centralized in Tunis and people after a certain age they choose to go to Tunis or migrate. \n\nI am now in the phase of introducing the concept and looking for freelancers, the ones that we have here are university students and then they go to university  and then I find my self collaborating with the new people coming to the space.\n\n\n**Khawla**:   we are facing the same in [Nabeul ?] and you need to know who are the interesting people in Medenine,  who will be interested in several activities in your space, you need to provide a service with permanent beneficiaries or clients.\n\n\n**Yosser** : how do you suggest this ? \n\n**Kahwala** : Itt is about service design,  you need to come up with a road map and make a needs-assessment first, what is the big deal in Medenine, for example in Mehdia , people are interested in arts, so spaces are focusing on arts and fabrication.\n\nIn [Nabeul ?] the community is focusing on recruiting and partnership with universities, now they are a partner with a university [ missing univesity name ]\n\nI worked in 2015 in Medenine there is a lot of community within social orientation, the association of halof and several working with empowering women, Jebra as well are interested in the non profit \nyou are from there and you know more about better and then you can build your service design around. \n\n\n**Yosser** :  how long did you stay in Medenine ?\n\n**Khawla** : Almost one year but was working 3 weeks in Tunis one week in Medenine. \n\n**Yosser** : if you stay in Medenine for longer, it is not easy when you go deeply, the youth are divided between going to Tunis or going to Europe even illegally \nI had someone working with me in the cafe, but still he wanted to migrate to Europe even after trying to talk and coneince him to stay and continue with the job.\n\nthe youth in Medenine are not focused but the only thing that they think about is to go out of Medenine to get a decent job even with the association that you worked with, you will find a lot of the leaders if thy find a chance to leave, the go.\n\nI am being honest, but it is hard here. \n\n**Khawla** :I understand and agree with you , we are as human we are seeking our own comfortable situation and lifestyle.\n\npeople who have their bachelor and university degree, and want to  go abroad and make their own future, we can gain from them but not giving them a service to stay in the space, we can include them as an online community to serve the interest of the Medenine community \nit is about digging in the shit, you have a challenges , ok you want to go abroad, come build this with me and  work for 4 month in ourghema, and you will get a chance to apply for scholarships.....\n\n2nd reflection, don't' focus on this people, now you are working with high school people, did you check if there is an existing clubs.\n\n**Yosser** : a good part is that these clubs come and hang out in the space. So yes currently I am focusing on this community right now. \n \nI actually started on it, I decided on it and starting some soft skills training as no one work on this in here, started with  a small training on public speaking, it is a training that I was  asked by a university to deliver \n\nI am starting with the soft skills as basics for now. \n\n**Khwala** : please make it fixed training like one hour a week, this is very helpful and you create informal ambassadors for your space \n\n**Yosser** : working on it , each Saturday we have an event on the space. If we say a soft training series/kit,  what do you suggest ? \n\n**Khawla**: The hard answer s  :D \n\ninvite every association and club that are working in Medenine and come up with a need assessment for the community. After that you will have a clear overview of a strategic plan of what kind of training from soft or hard , that youth in Medenine need. \n\n**Yosser** : When u started the space building a community in there how was it like ?\n\n**Khawla** : El space was different, but it is in the 2 first question that I aske you, why people should come to you ?\n\n[Building community and everything about social innovation and agile concepts, we started with this concept and then started learning labs which is tackling trends related to crowdfunding and collaborative economy and people get to know us, and know what is our vision . It is hard but after that we learn from them how, after you get to know your community needs and design the services needed. \u2026......]\n\n##Future Collaboration, Particip.io, OurGhema,  Elspace\n\n**hugi** : about participio we are organizing hackathons and weeks for developers to work together and this will be in different spaces, Tunisia was in my radar for this, it is hard to get to Medenine in the weekend events but may be for a longer event it could be interesting then I would be happy to hear from yosser if this could be interesting for the people inside the space ?\n\nThey are one in a weekend events and it is for people who know about software development and can contribute and learn. Then the week long events, and it is for experienced developers working together on the ideas that came on the hackathons. \n\nWhen I looked in  Medenine I see it is hard to do for a weekend , but for a week it could work, but do you have people working on software in the space ?\n\n\n**Yosser** : Yes I have a developers club, I work as well in development the market of software developers is in Medenine, I see it as a feasible thing to do.  we already organized as social innovation camp and people were excited. \n\nThis could work but depending on the timing it should be in the summer holidays \n\n\n**Hugi** : there is one in November 16-19 and then a week following that from the 19-25 \n\n**Yosser** I need to check, there is a holiday during November  but need to check the dates. \n\n**Hazem** : will it be feasible to have the weekend in Tunis  and then go for the week in Medenine ?\n\n**Khawla** : yes , we organize each year 2 hackathons with Paris[.......] , so yes you are welcome and tell me how we can organize it and we can even support ourghema if needed. \n\n**Hugi** : if we make it in november so the weekend should be in Tunis, if they are flying from outside. \n\n**Zmorda** : Jebra airport is just 30 minutes from medenine but you should have some early bookings to have cheap flights. \n\n\n**Hugi** : The Hackathon is very specific for a specific application, people should read before about the idea and will be focused on making this idea work, so it is quite focused hackathon but not a general theme one. \n\n\nWe can set up the time after the call.\n\n## Digital Medenine front\n\n**Hazem** : what about the Digital Medenine initiative ? Is it still going on, how are the updates? \n\n**Yosser** : it is going on, and some people started to collect the info with Hykal he is on the platfrom right now . The reason that we were not working on it because I was traveling and will be working on it for the next months if Matthias is also still available\n\n**Matthias** : I am still interested in the project and available for remote tech support. I  will be in Nepal  and will be working on something similar so the tools could be done and used and we can coordinate about that \n\n**zmorda** : matthias when are going to start in working on this project in Nepal and  for how long ? And can we start both projects at the same time ?\n\n**Matthias** : It will be more low key project starting may be February next year,  it will not be an official project but usually when I am in a place I start collecting this data and publish it and this always starts other projects\n\ndoesn't have to start in the same time, I can propose tools to be used in Medenine, will start as a wiki on the platform and take the discussion there.\n\n## Last question: OurGhema Meaning ?\n\n**Hazem**: what does Ourghema means ? \n\n**Yosser**:  they are the Tribes  that built Medenine, so lets rebuild Medenine with our vision again that we inherited from our ancestors, and logo is the Tatoos  that the old women had on their faces and hands holding the meanings of harmony and hard working.", "created_at": "2018-09-18 17:40:21.420613", "updated_at": "2018-09-18 17:40:34.133090", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2167, "wiki": true, "reads": 20, "score": 154.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70095, "user_id": 5209, "topic_id": 12646, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi all,\n\nA couple of days ago this paper of the European Commission leaked, it outlines some of their digital strategy in broad strokes.

I'm aware that you've found _Autonomous_ light on the economics and you've done a stellar job at harvesting what's there.\n\nAs someone that aligns more with political economics than pure economics, it's not surprising that I was following the _value dynamics_ that weave throughout the book. I was particularly drawn to the value differential Newitz opens across existing social and cultural norms.\n\nFor example, the remixing of social flows - from human-bot-love to gender fluidity to slave-come-franchised - \nis strong, and speaks to me, of the qualitative nature of autonomy beyond the bounds of law. What I mean by this is that I think Newitz foregrounds the kind of (biopolitical) economics that are emerging outside of the current economic paradigm, through the social register. For example, the book ends with Paladin:\n\n> \u201cUsing software she had installed in her own mind, the bot generated a new key to encrypt her memories. For the first time in her life, the process worked. Her memories were locked down, and the key that the Federation held in escrow would be useless. It would take centuries for even the most state-of-the-art machine to decrypt what she had seen and known for the months she\u2019d been alive. **At last, she knew what it felt like to own the totality of her experiences.\u201d**\n\n_(emphasis added)_\n\nPaladin moves from being an assumed male, programmed, indentured military bot to a female, autonomous, lover who owns her own experiences. \n\nYes the book is called _Autonomous_ after all. My point is simply that I think one of the opportunities that comes with the challenge of our current failing economic system is to reclaim economics all together. With a tighter and tighter hold by capital, comes more creative innovations to release ourselves from it. For example, I'm interested in future economic scenarios that reframe value, that are not only based on quantitive ledgers but also qualitative accounts - think from _I-owe-you_ to _this-was-created-here_. \n\nMy former supervisor Brian Massumi has just released a book called _[99 Theses on the Revaluation of Value](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/99-theses-on-the-revaluation-of-value)_ that says it all much better. It's ultimately about how _\"it is time to reclaim value from the capitalist market and the neoliberal reduction of life to \u201chuman capital\u201d\u2014time to occupy surplus-value for a postcapitalist future.\"_ (For a longer taste, see [this blog post](http://www.uminnpressblog.com/2018/09/occupy-surplus-value-toward-revaluation.html)).\n\nAnd so it seems Mazzucato and Massumi among others are calling us to rethink what value can be!

After two weeks of intense interaction with @owen, Marina and I (but mostly me when it comes to handling the configuration files) are quite happy with our first result, https://research.edgeryders.eu. Still some very minor thing missing, but the site is now in use. In general, I think you guys in the tech team (@matthias, @hugi, Owen himself) were right, and this is the way to go. \n\nDuring this test, an important pivot happened. Owen decided that JSON is not a good choice as the format of the configuration file, and switched to XML instead. Also, we discovered four things, that I consider important for the future development of the webkit.\n\n1. **The documentation now serves much more third-party users of the webkit than people in Edgeryders**. Both the repo and the documentation website resemble those of a normal open source project. They are completely useless to Marina, or Andreja. This is not a complaint, but a recommendation that that part of the documentation is now dropped, and some effort is put into making a step-by-step manual to making a website with the webkit. I am willing to contribute to it. From Owen's side, the first thing that needs to happen is that he produces an equivalent of the JSON example configuration file in XML. In general, the switch to XML has rendered obsolete part of the documentation. \n2. **The Discourse editor sucks at writing code**. You get very frustrated when trying to edit code from within Discourse. When we were doing JSON, my workflow was like this: \n   * Copy-paste the JSON config file into TextMate.\n   * Use the collapse function of TextMate to render the JSON at the highest level, like this:\n\n     ![image|428x280](upload://9UausN31XpnCTa3JRLFVDTdjkz9.png) \n    * Expand one block at a time, make the edit, re-collapse, etc. \n     * Copy-paste the result back into Discourse.\n\n   Now I will need to find something similar for XML. \n3. **To avoid messing with the configuration files, there should be almost no text in them.** Everything should be written in normal posts on Discourse, and the configuration file should point to those posts:\n\n```\n<Text topic=\"12345/1\"></Text>\n```\n   By the same token, **everything accessible via edgeryders.eu API should be made available to the webkit**. For example: whole categories; topics by tags; users, etc. \n\n4. **There is a need for themes, to standardize the Edgeryders look and feel and reduce the need for tweaking things**. My next website is going to be the SF-ECON website. I am completely OK with it looking exactly like the RezNet website (of course, with its own logo, colors, and images, but same theme). If we don't do that, we are going to spend a lot of time asking Owen to tweak things and the websites will bear no similarity to each other. Aligning the content is very fast with the webkit, so that 80% of the work is done in three hours, but without good theming the remaining 20% will take two weeks, and then, like Nadia says, we might as well build one-off Wordpress websites. \n\nCan I ask @hugi to incorporate these suggestions in future development decisions, and in how Owen's time is allocated?", "created_at": "2020-06-19 14:46:37.042167", "updated_at": "2020-06-19 14:46:37.042167", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 546, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 67.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3622, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34280, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6692, "post_number": 7, "raw": "@hazem that sounds like you then.", "created_at": "2017-08-11 12:12:39.483719", "updated_at": "2017-08-11 12:12:39.483719", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 24.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [34274], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60099, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10905, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@owen should I create separate posts per bio for the tagging to work, or will it work like this?", "created_at": "2019-09-30 02:41:14.199598", "updated_at": "2019-09-30 02:41:14.199598", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 12.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13132, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3554, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>2 works, just not for our biggest projects (conferences)</b>\n\nYour number 2 is the default case we use now, and it works well for all our small projects, since (as you say), activity is weak there, so further compartmentalizing it would squash it. The only case where the \"project is a team\" equation has the \"mostly bad\" side effects is conferences as our biggest projects, as shown by Ben looking for a way to keep collaborators from being overwhelmed by <em>all of the tasks at once</em>.\n\nAnd I'm looking for something to add to just LOTE-size projects, by admins. Normal-sized projects will still keep the \"one big team as a project\" mode.\n\nWhich leaves us with your number 1, where we would model LOTE4 as a set of multiple projects, one per team. This is what we did with Spot the Future, still a relatively small exercise, but it already led to a mess, with people cross-posting to all the STF related projects indiscriminately, to make sure their content get attention, as the overview about which STF projects are there and which are for which purpose had \"left\". At least in part because there was no way to see a list of all current STF related projects in Drupal (at least not in the \"New Node\" form).\n\nWhich brings us to the core of why I think the \"one project per team\" mode was poor modelling for STF: in computer science (specifically, object oriented programming), the standard rule to model (or \"cut\") reality into concepts is \"high cohesion and low coupling\". The \"one project per team\" mode meets the first condition, as a project has high inner cohesion, also if employed for a team. But coupling between \"normal\" projects is quite low (as it should be between separate entities), while coupling between all STF related (or all LOTE4 related) \"team\" projects is high, expressed through the confused cross-posting in STF <em>by default</em>, towards the end of it. Compounded by the problem of archiving the content: Could you still name all our STF related projects, so you would know where to find <em>all</em> the STF content again?\n\nI'm not a friend of introducing a new concept like \"Team\", but <em>if</em> we want to provide non-overwhelming task lists to LOTE4 collaborators, I still think it's the way to go. Still open for your proposals / arguments though :) Plus, \"Team\" would only be available for LOTE-sized projects.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-05 01:41:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.418442", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 432, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13016], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58169, "user_id": 5252, "topic_id": 10449, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Hello dears :) \nThe Reef is like an experimental embodiement of transversality between hard issues such as housing and environment and soft issues such as governance and community building.\nTo put it in a nutshell : these are also ingredients of my daily life recipe in Brussels and beyond. \n\nIn Brussels specifically, I do a lot with social changemakers that have chosen to give back life to obsolete and unused areas with circular purposes and techniques.

I spent this all year mapping actors and their interest. We can talk about it deeper but I guess some actors of social innovation would really love the project. CLTB and Coopcity are one of them and I'm pretty sure they'd be glad  to think about new economic models, access to land and buildings, creating communities of inhabitants and workers with the Reef experiment :). \n\n* I'd be glad to offer you some support on the matter of community building and co design [@Noemi](https://edgeryders.eu/u/noemi).  I'm working on consensus decision making processes these days mostly with [Toestand](https://toestand.be/en/toestand-international/)\n  ; know a bit on knowledge sharing and non formal education to help participants going out of their confort zone during those types of co design moments.The very last moment I practiced those skills was in Albania with youth communities from Kosovo, Macedonia and Albania :).

Computers and the Internet are complex systems, and not everyone needs to nor wants to understand all the intricacies of them. Sure, we could format our reports and letters via LaTeX, but frankly, any word processing software that wraps the functionality into a few easy to understand buttons does the trick too for most of us.\n\nOnline platforms that allow people to communicate within a wide range of models _(1:1, 1:many, many:many, private, open, open to friends-of-friends, and so on)_ need to give users feedback and information on the fly so they know which mode and setting is active, and if it is appropriate.\n\nIf the platform caters to just one type of audience, and centers around a specific interest or topic, that informs the audience directly on how to behave. And people can lurk before participating, so they follow the existing examples.\n\nWith an open and global platform, it is a lot harder to set these existing examples, because one does not know, with which subset the new member will interact first, nor with which topic.\n\nGood UX guides them, informs the newbies about the presets and their reasoning, and so on. Imagine you see someone else post racist hate speech. Depending on which options and how visible these are, you might just put that person on an \"ignore\" list and move on. Or you actively block the racist. Or maybe report the content to moderators, but leave the person unblocked, because doing both requires too much effort through the interface. \n\nUX can make or break how people interact with each other as a community, and especially with open source projects it is often enough added as an afterthought.

Then we develop codes for the threads that cover the content of the conversations taking place.

To ensure the transparency and methodological rigour of our work, we keep detailed memos in which we explain the decisions we made, identify concerns, and define paths forward. We also have monthly calls in which we discuss difficulties, code-collapsing, and relevant developments in the world of tech and culture (of which we also keep a log in the codebook).\n\nOver the past few weeks the NGI Forward ethnography team has been focussing much of their attention on threads pertaining to issues on the internet, tech and the environment. Our work on these threads has brought up two key insights that will be useful to keep in mind as we develop our methods.\n\nFirst, those of you community members interacting on these threads appear to largely represent experts in tech; meaning you either seem to be conducting research, developing software, platforms, applications, leading groups of innovators and designers, or engage in activism and journalism around tech issues. This is something to keep in mind both for community managers and ethnographers, as it means we are observing and coding insights based on expert knowledge --  we want to tailor our questions to you towards gaining a deeper understanding of emergent trends, policy, design and innovation. This level of knowledge and engagement on your part means we can ask you more detailed questions, as we are interested in your nuanced analyses of technology issues.\n\nInterestingly (and perhaps conversely), explorations of the relationship between the climate and the internet/tech appears to be in its infancy, and though we are working with a community of experts, there often seems to be a struggle to solidly define key terms and concepts. Despite expertise, or perhaps because of it, specificity in defining technologies and technological areas requiring increased research focus persists across stories, meaning that you might find defining targeted and specific problems around these areas difficult as well. Also of interest, many of you find an underlying tension between acknowledging the ecological costs of the tech industry and findings ways to develop technological tools to protect the climate. These two points seem to characterise a caution on the part of the community when it comes to making bold or definitive claims about tech and the climate. They also indicate a desire to define the terms we are using to make sure we are on the same page, talking to each other about the same things, before we try to give solutions to problems. This may explain why codes thus far are more topical (sketching the broad areas that you have been interested in discussing) than analytical or solutions-focussed. We don\u2019t necessarily see this as an issue, but instead something to track and pay attention to moving forward, as it may tell us all something about the challenges we face and approaches we take when trying to imagine the future of internet technologies. \n\n**![-eAZTPL0PAXhx0vRCEUJqdH3sT-LkP-2MsctTFL6sV-gKA9PerAKusQ-JA5APA8zLAQSPGSRqNQRUZ2yhhaVfBAliQlAffhpOIoSNpZPmbmQaQ0tK9PS--Bp3AuI3NZRqDqIE3dF](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eAZTPL0PAXhx0vRCEUJqdH3sT-LkP-2MsctTFL6sV-gKA9PerAKusQ-JA5APA8zLAQSPGSRqNQRUZ2yhhaVfBAliQlAffhpOIoSNpZPmbmQaQ0tK9PS--Bp3AuI3NZRqDqIE3dF)**\n\nSeveral current threads revolve around the notion of Deep Green Tech. While there is a lot of interesting discussion around this concept, it has yet to be clearly defined by the community. From what we can gather so far, Deep Green Tech is similar to Deep Tech, describing mainly startup companies based on substantial scientific research and innovations in tech engineering. Deep Green Tech, broadly, seems to describe technology that is ecologically sustainable, innovative and based on scientific advancements. The concept of Deep Green Tech appears to be a central area of focus for the NGI Forward community, but there seems to be ongoing discussions to clarify confusion around the term\u2019s definition, its ramifications and implications. As a result, we want to help cut through the opacity of these discussions by working with you to understand how you define the term while also asking you to give concrete examples of its application, e.g. in design, research, tech innovation etc. In this way, we think we might all move toward a deeper and more productive discussion of the futures we want to see. \n\nA notable tension that arises in community discussion on tech and the environment is that between navigating the ways in which tech/internet can help combat climate change and protect the environment and the energy and ecological costs that technological advancement has on the environment. We are interested in further exploring your understandings of this tension. \n\nFinally, an initial visualisation of the codes pulled from the NGI Forward threads revealed a range of central, yet general themes. This may be again based on the cautious atmosphere of community interactions at this stage, but it also seems to be linked to the absence of concrete examples and personal narratives. We want to start to understand these issues on a personal level, beyond just drawing upon general and objective material. Going forward, we want to gather your expertise by asking more biographically oriented questions, which may help us tease out personal narratives and interpersonal connections around these technologies and help you share what inspires you to think the way you do about these issues. Asking you what motivated you to work in tech, how you use the internet on a daily basis, etc. can help us capture a more dynamic picture of the internet of humans. \n\nLooking back on Open Care, it\u2019s rare that people have detached and impersonal stories about healthcare experiences. We need to find ways to explore similarly impactful or meaningful avenues around the Internet\u2014 to ask you to share stories about experiences or opinions formed from experiences, as well as abstract ideas.\n\nOne of the central things we\u2019re taught when doing the interviewing /question asking part of ethnography is to ask our participants to be specific by asking specific questions (this is what community managers on ER are always trying to do) \u2014 to move away from the general and ask what you did yesterday, to tell a story about a specific time something affected you, and so on. In Open Care, instead of asking \u2018what do you think of healthcare\u2019 it was \u2018tell us about a time you interacted with the healthcare system\u2014 what did it look like? How did you feel? What issues came up for you?\u2019\n\nIf we can find such parallels on the Internet (rather than \u2018what does the future look like to you\u2019?), instead \u2018tell us about the last time something online upset you, and why?\u2019 (or other questions along those lines, around sustainability for example) we might all get a deeper understanding.\n\nIn short, we hope to move away from asking how you think and feel in general and toward asking you about specific experiences, recollections that prompted emotional reaction, opinion forming, or action from them. We can't wait to hear more of your fascinating thoughts and experiences on these issues!", "created_at": "2019-10-31 15:23:15.885961", "updated_at": "2019-11-01 10:01:53.737242", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1256, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 2134.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 5059, 4, 5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 33, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-07-08 23:31:00.003100", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:37:58.703556", "deleted_at": "2017-08-03 17:05:44.694881", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2095, 1578], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13076, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1391, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Be selfish be generous</b>\n\n\"Be the change you want to see in the world\" (Ghandi)\n\nI love to watch this video, \"Be selfish be generous\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzSgn0LYW8g\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzSgn0LYW8g </a>\n\nLike you, I look for solutions to bring more harmony into this world.

What are you working on and why are you on the Internet Days?**\n\nMy name is Christer Roslund and I work for a company called Shardsecure social media. We are located in Hammarby Sj\u00f6stad in the Goto10 building that the Internet Foundation handles, for startups. We became the company they chose this year to be here and exhibit. It was pretty fitting.\n\nThe company I am part of is building a platform where you can break files in shreds and spread them out on the net and thus hide the information. We expect to have the product ready in first quarter of 2020.\n\nI have a long history in this. Has been working with IT and IT solutions since the 1980s. Has a background identity services. Has worked with disposable solutions, certificates. Has built  mobile banking solutions. We had a company that was largest in Sweden on a one-time passwords. Have actually been through all variants - state, municipal, private, French, Swedish. Regions. Quite fun. My background is security.\n\nWhat made me interested in computers\u2026 I wanted to be a rock star and we had such a bad drummer that we needed someone to program the drum machine. I thought it was easy. Then came Atari; Steinberger pro and so on. I took care of the computers when we were recording.\n\nNo band that became something of. then I had not been sitting here.\n\nIt was before the sampling times, so you had to use sequencers.\n\n**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**\n\nEvery day, really. Especially my kids who always ask me\u2026 my youngest, who is 13, asks me what life was like without the internet. Then you realize what opportunities exist. How was life really before the internet? A pretty good question.\n\nThat we can increase information flows, the opportunity to increase democracy, that we can reach out with democracy in countries that we have not been able to enter before. Then above all that it is an obvious part of one's everyday life. There are challenges with that too, but I think the pieces are interesting.\n\nRegarding online identity. I've left it a bit. Was so stuck in it for 20 years. From the late 90's. It was so intense, so I feel pretty content, that I'm done with identity management.\n\nWhat we are working on now is exciting. There is something in the solution that is tickling, not sure what. We solve two problems in the growth of quantum computers and the possibility of cracking encryption in seconds instead of decades.\n\nSomething that has been in the air for a while is that we can get around Could act. All US cloud companies - Amazon, all big ones - must enable the US state, regardless of country, so they can go in and get the information they want. This makes it impossible for Swedish county councils to use cloud services. With our technology we break our legs for it. An eye opener for quite a few. We can use it without the information becoming available to foreign power.\n\nQuantum computers. One should be honest and say that quantum computers, it is an extremely complex technology. Not like programming today's computers. A new generation of developers who think differently will be required. Have talked to some who have given up trying. There are quite a few who will fall out, who will not make it. Above all, it is asymmetrical encrypion  it is good at solving.\n\nIt becomes an eye opener for many when they discover that they have terrabytes encrypted on various cloud services that are as accessible after a few minutes as if it was unencrypted.\n\nOur solution solves this by breaking the data into shards. You can't access the entire data, and even if you do, it's in shards. You have to put it together and then go through our solution to put it together, where we check the permissions. Now it is a complement to encryption things but can eventually replace.\n\n**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**\n\nThe NSA was pretty scary. The whole Snowden affair was unpleasant. Even if you had sensed it, it had to be confirmed. I think it's scary when governments take social media by the ear and tell them what to do. If they do not, they threaten with action. Not so fresh. There are such things that are problematic, you might say. On the other hand, you have dark web management, with opportunities for criminals. On the other hand, you have the opportunity to be anonomys. Many challenges. Like society at large, really.\n\nRegarding AI - there are opportunities and challenges again, really. We are not really there, but are approaching with big steps. It doesn't scare me, actually, not as much as it should. Haven't seen anything that got me worried, in any way. I understand the potential. It does not scare me right now, but can see in the long run that there is a threat.

While regulating platforms or implementing advanced topic filtering algorithms are among possible solutions, bringing back trust to written words may be far more complicated.\n\n\n**Privacy**\n\n\nMuch has changed for online privacy in recent years. GDPR was a landmark for personal data protection in the EU and beyond, and the debate is now largely about how to regulate online platforms, not whether regulation is required. However, online privacy is not only threatened by the business models of tech giants, but also by applications like Pegasus and other non-transparent practices of foreign and national agencies.\n\n\n**Climate crisis**\n\n\nClimate change remains humanity\u2019s top challenge, with great impact on technological and social development. Besides already available consumer products, emerging technologies such as AI and quantum computing may play a significant role in reducing the harmful effects of global warming. However, the content crisis on social media divides society by popularising fake news. Therefore, Internet services play a greater role in the fight against climate change that is beyond the carbon footprint of using them. Reducing the spread of fake news and propaganda will be key to build a global consensus in the necessity to take more significant steps.\n\n\n**Competition**\n\n\nThe digital transformation has a profound impact on the economy. Platformisation changed the market dynamics, facilitating the development of giant companies. Competition policy became highly relevant not only in the case of existing services (e.g. social media), but also for emerging technologies, such as cryptocurrencies or 5G. While the US has been less active in regulating market competition, e.g. in the case of Facebook acquisition of rival Instagram and Whatsapp, the EU is leading the discussion on ensuring competition in the Digital Single Market.\n\n**Ethical AI**\n\nThe fast development of artificial intelligence algorithms and their increased use in facial recognition and autonomous weapons are among the most important identified trends. The use of facial recognition by companies, governments, law enforcement and the military has been in the centre of heated debates. Recent examples, such as Google\u2019s censored search engine developed for the Chinese market (\u2018Project Dragonfly\u2019), instances of algorithmic bias in criminal cases, racially targeted ads and \u201cdifferential\u201d pricing, and the use of Facebook data for voter manipulation, all raise serious concerns. Further research is needed in order to develop targeted ethical frameworks for the development and implementation of new technologies.\n\n**Other topics:** blockchain (less of a social issue), safer online environment (less policy), democracy (related to trustworthy info)", "created_at": "2020-11-12 08:35:31.906170", "updated_at": "2020-11-12 08:35:31.906170", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 447, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 21.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85265, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 14622, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Use this thread / topic for a running code review.

Mam wy\u017csze wykszta\u0142cenie techniczne i do\u015b\u0107 konkretne sprecyzowane i przemy\u015blane zapatrywanie w przeciwie\u0144stwie do pewnej strony politycznej, kt\u00f3ra wydaje si\u0119 by\u0107 do\u015b\u0107 \u0142atwowierna w swoich spo\u0142ecznych pogl\u0105dach.\n\nG\u0142osuj\u0119 na Korwina (ostatnio Konfederacja) od lat i w du\u017cej mierze jego zapatrywania, g\u0142\u00f3wnie na gospodark\u0119, ale te\u017c polityk\u0119 spo\u0142eczn\u0105 i zagraniczn\u0105, s\u0105 zbie\u017cne z moimi, czyli og\u00f3lnie mo\u017cna by t\u0119\nstron\u0119 polityczn\u0105 okre\u015bli\u0107 jako konserwatywno-liberaln\u0105 i bardzo europosceptyczn\u0105. Jestem po prawej stronie od zawsze i raczej niewiele wskazuje na to, \u017cebym zmieni\u0142 ten front, chocia\u017c kto wie- m\u00f3j ojciec, kt\u00f3ry przez ca\u0142e \u017cycie g\u0142osowa\u0142 na praw\u0105 stron\u0119, a ostatnio zag\u0142osowa\u0142 na Wiosn\u0119 (czym straci\u0142 m\u00f3j \u201eszacunek\u201d :) ).  Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce b\u0142\u0119dnie w badaniu postawiono tez\u0119, \u017ce to niby mamy teraz odchy\u0142 w praw\u0105 stron\u0105, kt\u00f3ry jest uchyleniem od normy, kt\u00f3r\u0105 rzekomo by\u0142 socjalistyczny, lewicowy kurs na lewo. B\u0142\u0105d, b\u0142\u0105d, b\u0142\u0105d, to w\u0142a\u015bnie normalnym kierunkiem przez wieki by\u0142a prawa, konserwatywna strona, a nie lewa. \n\nTo kilkudziesi\u0119cioletni skr\u0119t w kierunku popularyzacji, delikatnie rzecz ujmuj\u0105c, wszelkich dziwactw spo\u0142ecznych i delikatnie rzecz ujmuj\u0105c nie zbie\u017cnych z logik\u0105 i rozumem post\u0119powa\u0144, kt\u00f3re pr\u00f3buje si\u0119 wcisn\u0105\u0107 jako jedynie s\u0142uszne, a tak nie jest. Z powy\u017cszego zdania nale\u017ca\u0142oby tak\u017ce wykluczy\u0107 pozytywne jednak zmiany jakie zasz\u0142y w tym okresie. Niemniej jednak s\u0105dz\u0119, a wr\u0119cz jestem przekonany, \u017ce bez wp\u0142ywu Lewicowc\u00f3w r\u00f3wnie\u017c by nasta\u0142y w ramach rozwijaj\u0105cego si\u0119 \u015bwiata, pogl\u0105d\u00f3w, technologii i coraz bardziej otwartych umys\u0142\u00f3w. Zaryzykuj\u0119 tez\u0119, \u017ce mog\u0142oby by\u0107 nawet jeszcze lepiej, gdyby kwestiami spo\u0142ecznymi nie indoktrynowano lewack\u0105 propagand\u0105 a po prostu zwyk\u0142ym ludzkim rozs\u0105dkiem, logik\u0105 i rozumem. Dlatego jestem zwolennikiem w\u0142a\u015bnie prawej strony. Nie jestem za PiSem, ale zdecydowanie wol\u0119 PIS od PO-PSL, cho\u0107 w sumie to wszystko to w wielkiej mierze jeden wielki postkomunistyczny uk\u0142ad, z kt\u00f3rego pewnie niepr\u0119dko wyjdziemy. Ka\u017cdy znaj\u0105cy cho\u0107 odrobin\u0119 przebieg politycznych rozgrywek zgodzi\u0142by si\u0119 ze mn\u0105, \u017ce oszukano nas. Obiecano nam zmiane systemu, a okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce to s\u0105 albo ci sami ludzie u w\u0142adz, albo marionetki poprzedniego ustroju. Polecam film \"Nocna zmiana\", ew wywiady z lud\u017ami znaj\u0105cymi rzeczywisto\u015b\u0107 lat 90-tych.\n\nDlaczego wol\u0119 PiS od PO? Ich retoryka jest dla mnie bardziej zrozumia\u0142a. W pe\u0142ni zgadzam si\u0119 z @Pepe , \u017ce PiS przynajmniej ma odwag\u0119 podnie\u015b\u0107 ziemi tematy zakopane przez poprzednie uk\u0142ady: duma narodowa, si\u0142a, polsko\u015b\u0107 , a nawet tradycja religijna (cho\u0107 sam jestem z boku, ale szanuj\u0119 te kwestie) etc. i deklaruje walk\u0119 o te warto\u015bci. Polska ma prawo dochodzi\u0107 swoich praw i budzi\u0107 swoj\u0105 si\u0142\u0119. Wreszcie kto\u015b potrafi si\u0119 postawi\u0107 zachodnim krajom (przynajmniej pr\u00f3bowa\u0107 a nie poch\u0142ania\u0107 wszystkie warunki i propozycje zachodu jak us\u0142u\u017cny proletariusz na \u0142asce). PiS rozumie lud bardziej lub mniej, ale na pewno  m\u00f3wi do niego w\u0142a\u015bciwym j\u0119zykiem, w kwestiach spo\u0142eczno socjalnych, z kt\u00f3rymi jako prawicowiec ja akurat si\u0119 nie zgadzam. Widz\u0119 jednak, \u017ce PIS umie trafi\u0107 do narodu, albo po prostu znakomicie si\u0119 reklamuje. Retoryka opozycji w tym zakresie jest pokroju niedojrza\u0142ych ma\u0142ych ludzi, kt\u00f3rych jedynym argumentem krzycz\u0105cym w mojej g\u0142owie (i chyba nie tylko mojej) jest: Nie g\u0142osujcie na PIS bo oni s\u0105 \u017ali i zrobili zamach na konstytucj\u0119, a my jeste\u015bmy lepsi, ale dlaczego to ju\u017c nie s\u0142ycha\u0107 \u2026. ???? Co\u015b w stylu sceny z dnia \u015bwira o racji mojszej \u2026. Ni\u017c twojszej\n\nJestem te\u017c realist\u0105, skoro ju\u017c jeste\u015bmy w UE, to b\u0105d\u017amy w niej, ale na lito\u015b\u0107 bosk\u0105- zmieniajmy j\u0105. Dla mnie w takiej formie UE jest nie do przyj\u0119cia. Brak tam realnych i pro ludzkich i gospodarczych rozwi\u0105za\u0144, w chwili obecnej widz\u0119 tam bardziej \u201eaparat\u201d uk\u0142ad\u00f3w i rozgrywek mi\u0119dzy lud\u017ami kt\u00f3rzy miel\u0105 i tworz\u0105 pozbawione logiki i prostoty ustawodawstwo tylko w ramach prac pod tytu\u0142em musimy zapier\u2026. To nie wa\u017cne \u017ce z pust\u0105 taczk\u0105, grunt \u017ceby zapier \u2026.UE za du\u017co chce w zamian za dop\u0142aty w euro. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce stracili\u015bmy za duzo suwerenno\u015bci na rzecz UE. \n\nTak, jestem pragmatykiem, nie podoba mi si\u0119 uprawiane rozdawnictwo, kt\u00f3re proponuje UE i PiS w Polsce, jestem za tym, aby dawa\u0107 ludziom w\u0119dk\u0119, a nie ryb\u0119. Na ten moment nie mam niestety pomys\u0142u co robi\u0107 z lud\u017ami, kt\u00f3rzy zjadaj\u0105 w\u0119dk\u0119, ale generalnie wierz\u0119 w samosterowalno\u015b\u0107 gospodarki i w tym senesie jestem libera\u0142em. Masz tyle, na ile zapracujesz. Id\u0105c w to s\u0105dz\u0119, \u017ce z czasem ludzie zjadaj\u0105cy w\u0119dki zacz\u0119liby jednak na nie \u0142owi\u0107 (cho\u0107 wtedy nale\u017ca\u0142a by im si\u0119 kolejna szansa na jej otrzymanie, co popieram \u2013 dawa\u0107 wedk\u0119 do skutku, a ryb\u0119 do przys\u0142owiowych trzech razy sztuka) Rozdawnictwo to psucie ludzi ucz\u0105ce bezradno\u015bci i wiary w \u201ePana\u201d kt\u00f3ry zawsze i w ka\u017cdej sytuacji mn\u0105 si\u0119 zaopiekuje, a chyba ka\u017cdy widzi \u017ce \u201ePan\u201d jednak cz\u0119sto opuszcza nas w potrzebach \u2013 realnych potrzebach. Obstawiam podmiotowo\u015b\u0107 zar\u00f3wno jednostki jak i kraju. Jestem za zwi\u0119kszeniem samodzielno\u015bci i niezale\u017cno\u015bci kraj\u00f3w na arenie UE. UE nie powinna tak bardzo ingerowa\u0107 w wewn\u0119trzne sprawy suwerennych Pa\u0144stw. Rzadko ogl\u0105dam wiadomo\u015bci, ale je\u015bli ju\u017c to faktycznie publiczn\u0105 (najcz\u0119\u015bciej teleexpress). Wzburza mnie faktycznie jak\u0105 cha\u0142\u0119 odwala na tym polu PiS, ale wcze\u015bniej w zasadzie dzia\u0142o si\u0119 to samo, cho\u0107 mo\u017ce bardziej subtelnie. Tak te\u017c dzia\u0142a PiS, bardziej bezpo\u015brednio, bez bia\u0142ych r\u0119kawiczek jak PO wcze\u015bniej. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce ludzie to szanuj\u0105 \"Przynajmniej nie udaj\u0105\". Jak rewolucja, to rewolucja a nie dzia\u0142anie na podw\u00f3jnej rzeczywisto\u015bci (tej dla mas i tej dla nas z uk\u0142adu).  Brzydz\u0119 si\u0119 tylko nadu\u017cywaniem symboli narodowych. Do\u015b\u0107 mocno  PiS nadwyr\u0119\u017cy\u0142 mi warto\u015b\u0107 s\u0142owa \"patriotyzm\".

The Italian media activist / theorist Franco \"bifo\" Berardi has referred to communication as \"soul work\", a term I really like, secularizing (and thus making available in ways beyond religious or spiritual usages) a key term to approach a more holistic idea of what we do when we express ourselves, linking self- and world-making in what is ultimately a uniquely personal practice and a way of being-in-the-world. Not as \"actor\", \"citizen\", or \"stakeholder\", but as a full human being, whatever that is exactly. This is also why I have never viewed alternative (federated etc) communication platforms as \"the\" solution or the sole means of exiting the universe of what I would call extractivist empowerment (no denying that people find ways to use fb et all for good, whatever the limitations of the corporate visions driving the development of these commercial platforms). If we follow the same protocols of individual and collective self-production on new platforms not much is gained imo.

Byli za\u0142amani, zniesmaczeni. Ich pierwsza reakcja w kontakcie ze mn\u0105 dotyczy\u0142a moich wybor\u00f3w- \"Ty pewnie g\u0142osowa\u0142e\u015b na PiS\". Ale nie spotka\u0142 mnie z ich strony \u017caden ostracyzm, przypuszam, \u017ce to dlatego, i\u017c mamy dobre relacje. Ale gdybym w jaki\u015b spos\u00f3b wyst\u0105pi\u0142 z nimi na szerszym forum, cho\u0107 sam uwa\u017cam to za niestosowne, w\u00f3wczas zdecydowanie spotka\u0142bym si\u0119 z ostracyzmem w urz\u0119dzie. Tym bardziej, \u017ce moim szefem jest polityk PO Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski. Ale nawet, gdyby by\u0142 z PiS nie, afiszowa\u0142bym si\u0119 z pogl\u0105dami.\n\nA czy doj\u015bcie do w\u0142adzy PiS zmini\u0142o co\u015b w moich relacjach prywatnych? Raczej nie, chocia\u017c widz\u0119 polaryzuj\u0105ce si\u0119 spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo. Przy rodzinnych spotkaniach jest do\u015b\u0107 gor\u0105co...Tzn ja z regu\u0142y nie lubie wdawa\u0107 si\u0119 w polityczne dysputy, szczeg\u00f3lnie przy rodzinnym stole. Tam szczeg\u00f3lnie pojawiaj\u0105 si\u0119 silne emocje. Nie szukam okazji do rozm\u00f3w w tematach politycznych. A je\u015bli ju\u017c si\u0119 pojawiaj\u0105, to staram si\u0119 raczej \u0142agodzi\u0107 emocje i nie wchodzi\u0107 w dyskusje, szczeg\u00f3lnie, \u017ce z regu\u0142y to s\u0105 dysputy zagorza\u0142ych \nzwolennik\u00f3w/przeciwnik\u00f3w, a ja lubi\u0119 postrzega\u0107 siebie jako cz\u0142owieka raczej stonowanego.\n\nMoja najbli\u017csza rodzina g\u0142osuje na PiS, m\u00f3j ojciec jest zagorza\u0142ym zwolennikiem tej partii. W zasadzie jest 100% wyborcom PiSu, z najczarniejszego snu redaktora TVN. Jak g\u0142osuje kraina mojego pochodzenia- woj. \u0142\u00f3dzkie? Za wyj\u0105tkiem samej \u0141odzi, \u0142\u00f3dzkie jest propisowskie, te\u017c konfederacja przekroczy\u0142a tam pr\u00f3g wyborczy. Nie wiem dlaczego PiS tak znacz\u0105co wygrywa w woj. \u0142\u00f3dzkiem. M\u00f3wi nam si\u0119, \u017ce to raczej ci biedniejsi i gorzej wykszta\u0142ceni g\u0142osuj\u0105 na PiS. Nie wiem czy tak jest, raczej w\u0105tpi\u0119. \n\nMiasto mojego pochodzenia to Be\u0142chat\u00f3w, miejscowo\u015b\u0107 blisko 60 tys. Kiedy\u015b bardzo biedny region, od czas\u00f3w Gierka, dzi\u0119ki budowie kopalni, sta\u0142 sie miastem, do kt\u00f3rego nap\u0142yn\u0119li ludzie z ca\u0142ej Polski i to s\u0105 w wi\u0119kszo\u015bci ludzie dobrze zarabiaj\u0105cy, dobrze wykszta\u0142ceni specjali\u015bci w bran\u017cach technicznych. Kiedy\u015b u\u017cyto by okre\u015blenia, \u017ce to miasto robotnicze, proletariackie, ale to nie przystaje do wsp\u00f3\u0142czesnych reali\u00f3w. W ka\u017cdym razie Be\u0142chat\u00f3w jawi mi si\u0119 jako miasto technik\u00f3w i majstr\u00f3w, ludzi maj\u0105cych fach w r\u0119ku, musz\u0105cych nierzadko w swojej pracy rozwi\u0105zywa\u0107 skomplikowane problemy. \u0141\u00f3dzkie faktycznie nie jest jako\u015b specjalnie rozwini\u0119te na tle kraju, jest tu te\u017c du\u017ce przywi\u0105zanie do tradycji. Has\u0142a patriotyczne, deklarowane przywi\u0105zanie PiS do religii, Ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Sporo na wsiach i w ma\u0142ych miasteczkach takiego lokalnego folkloru i PiS dobrze si\u0119 tam wpasowuje. Niech\u0119\u0107 do Niemc\u00f3w, do\u015bwiadczenia wojenne, partyzantka antykomunistyczna. \n\nWg mnie stopie\u0144 wykszta\u0142cenia nie ma tu \u017cadnego znaczenia je\u015bli chodzi o wyb\u00f3r polityczny. To raczej wynika w\u0142a\u015bnie z r\u00f3\u017cnic kulturowych i regionalnych ni\u017c z wykszta\u0142cenia. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce poprzednia w\u0142adza by\u0142a odrealniona. Mo\u017ce to nie wyszkta\u0142cenie formalne i wielko\u015b\u0107 zbiorowo\u015b\u0107i jest wa\u017cna, ale znacz\u0105ce jest to, \u017ce \u0142\u00f3dzkie to region twardo st\u0105paj\u0105cy po ziemi i ja siebie te\u017c tak postrzegam, mimo wy\u017cszego wykszta\u0142cenia i kilkunastoletnich, silnych zwi\u0105zk\u00f3w z Warszaw\u0105. Wszelkie wielkomiejskie aferki, wega\u0144skie burgery i sojowe latte, gendery, lgbt, o\u015bmiorniczki itd powoduj\u0105, \u017ce PO i Wiosna s\u0105 na straconej pozycji. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce dla ludzi z mojego regionu wa\u017cne jest rozwi\u0105zywanie konkretnych problem\u00f3w, dzia\u0142anie tu i teraz, oparte na solidnych podstawach moralnych: tradycyjnych warto\u015bciach i przywi\u0105zaniu do religii. \n\nNie zapominajmy, \u017ce moje okolice rodzinne do lat 70. to by\u0142y g\u0142\u00f3wnie malutkie gospodarstwa na lichych piaskach i troch\u0119 przemys\u0142u w\u0142\u00f3kienniczego. Region do\u015b\u0107 mocno zakonserwowany. Kiedy by\u0142em podrostkiem w regionie \u017cy\u0142o jeszcze sporo os\u00f3b, kt\u00f3re pami\u0119ta\u0142y brutalno\u015b\u0107 okupacji niemieckiej i sowieckiej, a tak\u017ce but\u0119 i okrucie\u0144stwo przedstawicieli \"ludowej\" w\u0142adzy. Po wojnie dzia\u0142a\u0142o do\u015b\u0107 pr\u0119\u017cnie podziemie antykomunistyczne. W\u0142asne gospodarstwo i kawa\u0142ek ziemi by\u0142y prawdziw\u0105 \u015bwi\u0119to\u015bci\u0105. Prawica dobrze rozumie te sentymenty i wpasowuje si\u0119 w to. Ma\u0142o kto zag\u0142osuje tu na opcje polityczne, kt\u00f3re kojarz\u0105 si\u0119 z w jaki\u015b spos\u00f3b z \"t\u0119czow\u0105\" Europ\u0105 - wrog\u0105 polskiej tradycji.\n\nUrz\u0119dnik, Warszawa (Be\u0142chat\u00f3w), 30+, wy\u017csze wykszta\u0142cenie.", "created_at": "2019-07-17 13:33:22.601412", "updated_at": "2019-07-29 08:27:22.918614", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 837, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 52.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [137], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6902, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6221, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Didn't make the connection.</b>\n\nAlthough i did\u00a0read Matteo's post about the challenges of making businesses comply with mobility regulations.\u00a0So open rampette becomes a project informed by opencare and the Milano team, and is already ongoing?

But that's only been organized in the form of \"jobs\" for a comparatively short period. And the main reason for that was that the shift in the First Industrial Revolution from production primarily with general-purpose, individually affordable craft tools to production with extremely specialized, expensive machinery in factories. The result was that only associations of the very rich could afford the factories, and then they hired propertyless proles to work the machinery for them on terms set by themselves. Today, with open hardware micromanufacturing, permaculture and open-source information production, that trend is being reversed -- most production can be carried out now with individually affordable tools. It's mainly patents and copyrights, and other state-enforced monopolies, that enable the corporate dinosaurs to retain control over access to the means of production. So we need to destroy the power of the corporations (by ignoring their monopolies and rendering them unenforceable) and the concept of the \"job\" along with it, and shift work into household self-provisioning and the informal and local economies.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-20 21:14:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:11.041951", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 194, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56585, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 52, "raw": "[quote=\"alberto, post:51, topic:10217\"]\nOK, \u201cprinciples for developing Edgeryders software projects then\u201d.\n[/quote]\n\nI would want to have a say on iterating this before it becomes a manual. There are quite a lot of areas in which @matthias and I operate under different paradigms.\n\nThis will become a bit lengthy, and also runs the risk of hijacking this thread from its original purpose. Perhaps we should fork it? I will split this post into two \u2013 one addressing the more general points on how we do things and the other on the subject of microsites with Discourse as their CMS in particular.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:47, topic:10217\"]\n**Open source**\n[/quote]\n\nOn this point, we agree completely.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:47, topic:10217\"]\n**Hostable on the Edgeryders server.** We have a \u201cone server for everything\u201d approach and all software used for Edgeryders projects should be on that server.\n[/quote]\n\nCurrently, the following Edgeryders software and sites are hosted outside of that server:\n\n* Graphryder OpenCare API Database (run by Bordeaux guys)\n* Graphryder MENA API, database & dashboard (hosted on same Digital Ocean droplet)\n* Participio API serving Culture Squad and Internet of Humans minisites (hosted on other Digital Ocean droplet)\n* Realities (an Edgeryders project through Participio)\n\nAnd more will come. Unless we mature Graphryder to handle multiple datasets on the same database, we need a separate server for each instance, since Neo4j Community edition can only run one database at a time. This means one server for POPREBEL Graphryder and another for NGI Graphryder.\n\nFurthermore, if we ever start selling Graphryder, we will want to streamline its deployment with something like a docker image. Same goes for Realities, which I would also like to develop further. And I have another 20k in the Participio budget earmarked for some new experimental software for participatory culture, yet to be determined. \n\nWe don't want to bloat the mission-critical server we use for Discourse with all kinds of environments, databases, and packages. But we also don't want to let one set of technology dictate what other technology can be deployed in Edgeryders. \n\nDeploying small virtual servers on-demand makes a lot of sense and a lot of freedom. Indeed, we've never had to even disagree about this since I've just gone ahead and done it without having to ask permission. That's much more in the spirit of Edgeryders, a lot more than \"one server for all Edgeryders projects\" in my opinion.\n\nWhat we should have though is documentation of where our software is deployed, who has root access to a given server or VPS, and who has been given limited SSH access.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:47, topic:10217\"]\n**Language choice.** Our software landscape is mainly Ruby (because Discourse) and Python (Graphryder, Alberto\u2019s scripts, Dynalist Companion etc.).\n[/quote]\n\nThis is true for backend, but not really front end. Our front end (Discourse client, GraphRyder dashboard, Culture Squad minisite, Owens minisites) are mainly JavaScript. \n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:47, topic:10217\"]\nfor a software that interacts with Discourse, Ruby would be an obvious choice, as it makes it easy to work with for people who know their way around developing with Discourse already.\n[/quote]\n\nThis is only true for back-end. And I would not at all be opposed to replacing the very minimal JavaScript API that powers the Culture Squad and Internet of Humans minisites with something built in Ruby or Python. But for the front end, it would be more consistent with Discourse to use JavaScript.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:47, topic:10217\"]\nthen it installed 600+ packages, then it compiled 300+ things\n[/quote]\n\nWelcome to front-end javascript world :stuck_out_tongue:. However, you don't need to run a server process to serve a Vue.js website. It can be completely pre-built. For example, both the Culture Squad and Internet of Humans sites are pre-built single-site web apps that don't need any server process apart from a normal web server. You don't even have to compile them on the server. You can simply build locally and push the dist folder. Or you can make your life easy and use something like surge.sh or netlify.com and have your site magically deploy a build every time you push changes to git. \n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:47, topic:10217\"]\nAs in, \u201cdo not create software that depends on yourself\u201d.\n[/quote]\n\nThis is true. But having one paradigm to rule them all does not make this easier. For example, I would argue that when it comes to web development, our network of Node JavaScript  developers is pretty strong (@luca_mearelli, @erikfrisk, @gustavlrsn, @owen and to some extent myself though I'm more of an API and database guy). \n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:47, topic:10217\"]\nAnd if there is a choice, static websites are great from this perspective due to the minimal attack surface.\n[/quote]\n\nYes, I agree. But you can still create content from a static website as long as that website has an API to talk to. And with modern JavaScript, a single-site static website can feel like it's not static at all.\n\nSince the content is loaded directly from discourse to the browser client of the minisite user or from a lightweight cache of the content on Discourse, you don\u2019t need to keep rebuilding the site with cron to get new content.", "created_at": "2019-07-13 01:46:49.613372", "updated_at": "2019-07-13 12:05:54.574176", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 897, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 2.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [56525, 56495], "is_reply_to": [56525, 56495], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72007, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 12899, "post_number": 3, "raw": "[quote=\"Andreea, post:2, topic:12899\"]\n* How do we form interdisciplinary communities of experts who think together about a given problem?\n* How do we recruit and engage the right people?\n[/quote]\n\nRight now with Edgeryders we are in a similar situation like you - we have ongoing projects that have their missions, but faced with the crisis we are doing our best to shift the conversations around the things that we humans care about these days - a simple routine I could recommend is the weekly open calls to all those interested in some efforts:\n\nExample: \n\nEach Monday we are onboarding those people who want to find something community like to do during this lockdown: https://edgeryders.eu/t/weekly-covid2019-community-response-call/12919\n\nEach Tuesday we are hosting themed calls on Loss of work in the times of corona - the themes will change every month or so: https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-to-do-when-losing-work-during-covid19-community-calls-each-tuesday-noon/12886\n\nAnyone can join the calls, but community managers send more targeted invites or reach out to those who probably woudl benefit a lot or could offer expertise to also join.

But mindless use may also induce resistance over time (just like antibiotics abuse \u2013 which is a societal problem, not a personal one). So probably it's not a good idea to take it when the COVID-19 disease takes a light form (= not having to be in the hospital). Also being in the hospital seems a good idea if something about this off-label use of chloroquine would go wrong.\n\n* In HIV therapy (which is the only major source of experience with antiviral therapy), usually 2-3 drugs are combined to prevent the emergence of resistance. In the case of COVID-19, it would mean combining chloroquine and remdesivir, the only other effective drug. But where remdesivir is not available, chloroquine alone is also effective. Also, that combination therapy has not been tested with these two drugs, and there may be undesired side effects from that combination. Which means, I'd go with chloroquine alone until there is a clinical study saying the combination is safe.\n\n* Chloroquine is easy to overdose, but what exactly is an overdose seems to depend a lot on the individual. Ideally cell-level concentrations of chloroquine would be measured until reaching the right dose. If that's not possible, probably calculate the dose based on body weight and then take the pills gradually as long as there are no serious side effects. For example if the calculated full dose would be 500 mg, one would take 250 mg on day 1, 125 mg on day 2, 125 mg on day 3. But that's just my own estimate \u2013 please check for official guidance once you might need it.\n\n* I have no idea about how long the treatment should be, or in what interval to repeat taking the pills. Just note that for malaria prophylaxis, chloroquine is *not* to be taken daily, as it keeps around a long time in the body. When taken against malaria, it's one pill of 250 mg per *week*.\n\nThat's everything I know so far. There will be better information available online in a few weeks when you might eventually need it.", "created_at": "2020-03-03 13:17:54.544861", "updated_at": "2020-03-24 22:39:40.694277", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 382, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 39.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [70840], "is_liked_by": [4022, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49150, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 9261, "post_number": 7, "raw": "In the meantime, perhaps also contact Olga for the development version?", "created_at": "2018-12-03 18:31:23.495874", "updated_at": "2018-12-03 18:31:23.495874", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [49149], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72814, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 12970, "post_number": 8, "raw": "#featured\n[quote=\"MariaEuler, post:216, topic:12164\"]\nFeels like living in a different reality due to following non-local news.

To which extent can pieces of this solarpunk utopia stand alone?[/quote]\n\nA MVP, or rather a proper demonstration project, could be to deploy as many of these systems as possible in one city block or even just a large apartment block (so, for 2,000 - 10,000 people). A yet-to-be-built apartment block is attractive because, unlike with city blocks or informal settlements, it would need only the consent of one developer and not of government officials or \"all the people\".\n\nAlternatively, some elements of the system can also be used alone on city-scale. The most innovative ones that are also unlikely to meet much resistance from citizens would be the right candidates here: see \"sharing systems\", \"food\", \"electricity\", \"cooking and heating\" and perhaps \"traffic\". But there will be \"NIMBY\" type resistance to change anyway, so an apartment block as a demonstration project seems much more attractive to me.\n\nAfter writing the paper above, I started some case studies to show the feasibility of the proposed components of my system. However I discovered a [quite hilarious failure](https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-05-31/chinas-failed-experiment-dry-toilets) where dry toilets were used in a large apartment block of public housing in China, and that's already the largest scale they were ever used in an urban area. I know what would have to be different, but cities won't go near such alternative wastewater systems in the next years. The comfort of middle-class citizens is still much more valuable than environmental concerns. It will be similar with most of my other proposals above: too much \"out there\" to have a realistic chance of a city administration wanting to try them. I looked at conferences and forums of progressive mayors etc. but they seem to discuss mostly bullshit (\"smart cities and the Internet of Things\" etc.) and where not, are not nearly radical enough.\n\nSo yea. It won't happen as there is little to no audience for such ideas. I hope to be proven wrong of course \u2013 maybe the right person will find this thread one day. But I'll not actively pursue this much. Rather, I'll focus on [a remote village](https://goo.gl/maps/cHdxBYY7UXP2) in Nepal.

A Who's who would simply be a list: name, contact info, description in maximum three-four lines of text. If we want to get sophisticated we can add some categorization (\"environmental group\", \"civic hackers\" or so).\n\nThe second: a <strong>web of collaboration</strong> across the people/orgs in the Who's who. This would be a graph that uses the Who's who as a database. To a first approximation it can just be you guys to say \"I know X works with Y\" and we draw an edge connecting X with Y. In doubt, we can simply get back to them and ask \"who do you work with?\". As you know, I am quite experienced in looking at social graphs and interpreting them: for example, if in one country everyone we talk to links back to UNDP... we are in trouble. It means we did not manage to get out of the usual suspects space. Most edges will be within-country, but we will pay special attention to cross-country collaboration, which are very precious.

A smart community outperforms any of its members; this is the result of people working together, improving on each other\u2019s work. So, we use graph theory, combined with ethnography, to access the wisdom of the crowd. You can think of it as an artificial intelligence whose components are human beings. Our methodology is based on what we call [Semantic Social Networks ](http://bit.ly/digital-ethnography). It has several advantages:\n\n* **Robust**  to ill-defined questions. Exploratory questions are important. Who is doing the most interesting work on X? Which trends are emerging around Y? Free-form conversation minimizes framing biases and encourages serendipitous discovery.\n* **Scalable** . Edgeryders projects can result in large online conversations, with hundreds or thousands of participants. We use graph theory to aggregate them, and extract from them what is most important or unexpected.\n* **Rigorous** . Mining Semantic Social Networks yields qualitative and quantitative research. We apply network metrics to score and weigh the qualitative conclusions of ethnographers.\n* **Beautiful and intuitive**. Everything we do is a network, and networks are easy to visualize. In fact, most people find them intuitive and beautiful. We provide visualizations of our data with all our projects.\n\n---\n\n### We develop and use our own Open Source tools for sensemaking and co-creation \n\nAn innovative suite of online software developed, customized and maintained by Edgeryders. The software has been developed in cooperation with leading universities and deployed in projects for the World Bank, United Nations Development Program. It has been supported by Grants from the Rockefeller foundation and funding for Horison2020 research.\n\n**Open Ethnographer: helps you to understand how communities make meaning and create culture, from the point of view of the community itself**. It is an open source tool for Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA), which is a way to systematize and understand long chunks of text and to make sense out of it. OpenEthnographer is used for \u201ccoding\u201d or tagging the content of online conversations, with awareness of how each tag fits into the social network of interactions.** It is a simple to use and intuitive tool that is key to other and more rich visualizations (ie through the use of Graphryder). Ethnography as always been a solitary science, Open Ethnographer is a new and scalable system that allows digital ethnography at an unprecedented scale, and because the goal of Ethnography is to understand communities make meaning and create culture, from the point of view of the community itself, OE is one of the first step to harness collective intelligence at work. It\u2019s developed for and by ethnographers, but can easily be taught to any community manager to keep track of an online conversation at depth.\n\n### Videos\n  * [General intro to Ethnography](https://youtu.be/G_DoEa3lcBE)\n  * [Course Material](http://academy.edgeryders.eu/#open_ethnography)\n  * [Open Ethnographer Tool - Demo](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dd5d18b391e19d39772dc44458be57068d3c31f5.mp4 )\n\n**EdgeSense: help you understand how much your community members are active and engaged in the conversation, which is key to understand different roles or project groups that could emerge during the period of activity.**  It is a dashboard that allows community administrator to understand their community. It\u2019s organized around a graphical representation of the community where nodes represents users and edges represent interactions.  **EdgeSense helps you take decision on your community management. For example is it possible to highlight or hide the role of moderators, and understand how much the community is self-sustainable or need a push from the center.**  Another possible analysis is based on the subcommunities that are active in and how dense the networks are between subcommunities. Analysis of nodes then help you understand how much your community members are active and engaged in the conversation, which is key to understand different roles or project groups that could emerge during the period of activity.\n\n### Videos\n * General intro to : \n  * Course Material:  [Masters of Networks](https://edgeryders.eu/t/masters-of-networks-a-participatory-way-to-cross-check-topic-identification/12400)\n  * Edgesense Tool: [Demo](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/6/65119d20090164ab7bbec2c921c456d2408b28bb.mp4 ) \n\n**Graphryder: Helps you navigate conversations at scale and gain insight into your community because it maps out a graph of the view of the community about sets of topics, and it can lead to unexpected solutions or original point of views.**  It is a dashboard tool that allow us to analyze the conversations that are happening in the community through reading of ethnographic data. Graphryder is based on innovative academic research which has led to publication in scientific journals. A dashboard represents conversations, and the fieldnotes made by researchers thereon, in network form. We call these networks semantic social networks, as they incorporate information on social interaction and their meaning. They encode a map of the associations between key concepts as perceived by informants as a group. Graphryder is what helps you navigate conversations at scale and gain insights.\n\n### Videos:\n * General intro to \n  * [Course Material](http://academy.edgeryders.eu/#harness_graphryder)\n  * [Graphryder Tool - Demo](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b3efac98710d61a7ba3fba4c0f98b7aa830f28d0.mp4 )\n\n---\n\n### Publications\n* *[Semantic social networks: a new approach to scaling digital ethnography](https://zenodo.org/record/1059029#.XrWQE1Mzb8N)* (2017)\n* Cottica A., Hassoun A., Salantiu N.

More often than not, most of these rules tell us what not to do.<i>Don't lie. Don't steal. Don't use the copy machine after 8pm. Don't use company resources for personal use</i>. I think offering a set of rules is a good thing - they help maintain order inside an organziation. Understanding the value of such guidance, I recently issued a set of rules to my team. But there's a catch. In our organization, there will be no rules to tell us what not to do.\n\n<em><strong>Rules that tell us what not to do hold people back.

I don't mean to say that elections are useless, of course! But voting has always looked like a lesser substitute to direct action for me.

Selecting would be on project level, or if we want to really go all the way, through a field on node / comment level.\n\nThe solution for secondary data that includes quotes (not a problem for Edgesense!) would be Alberto's first \"easiest\" alternative: restrict the license of the secondary data (graph file) to the most restrictive license used on the primary data (posts and comments). Or if we want, mark up all verbatim takeovers in the secondary data with their respective licence, as indicated by users originally. Having secondary data under copyleft (with a \"Share Alike\" clause) is preferable anyway because it keeps research ethical \u2026\n\nFor interoperability and mutual benefits, I'd suggest that only open licences (incl. ShareAlike ones of course) would be available as choices when posting content. To use an analogy, edgeryders.eu is like a large software code repository.\n\n@Ben: a CC-BY-NC-* licence does not protect against somebody taking an <em>idea</em> or <em>name</em> and monetizing it. Just against somebody taking an exact copy of a text, logo, work of art etc. and monetizing it. Redrawing the same logo from memory and selling that is not prevented by CC-BY-NC-*. Since viewing public web content does not require signing a T&amp;C document, I think the rules you're looking for can't be had at the same time when as when having public content. Except when going via the expensive routes of trademark protection before publishing a name / brand, or via the patent route before publishing a technical invention. I don't think there is a legal route how concepts and non-technical inventions can be protected, except through secrecy and the T&amp;Cs of a closed online space. But anyway, this is another interesting discussion, beyond the content licencing. Let's have it in time!\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-08 22:12:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:50.459155", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 346, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67955, "user_id": 5538, "topic_id": 12097, "post_number": 11, "raw": "> **Avoiding AC conversion.**  Additional cost reductions can be realized by running the heat pumps on direct solar DC electricity. To adapt to available energy supply, heat pumps would either run at variable speed similar to water pumps that are already available for this purpose, or multiple heat pumps would run in parallel to scale consumption with production. This avoids the investment in inverters and the 6-8% conversion losses of converting DC to AC electricity \n\nYou may want to take inspiration from a scuttlebutt denizen who worked on the opposite problem; refrigeration. [(@)joeyh](http://joeyh.name/offgrid/fridge/) did a batteryless offgrid fridge for keeping his food. Programmed in haskell, because.\n\nAdditionally, even DC powered items may require switching elements and loss for variable speed operation. In the case of AC inverters, most have a 'dc-link' stage prior to the H-Bridge; most will permit direct DC in connection on these terminals with proviso for proper overcurrent protection.\n\nMany multi motor applications I have seen are set up in a one variable speed, many single speed topology; where the matching of the demand and the supply are compensated by the inverter; and the single speed starters are dispatched by a plc. \n\nI'm a huge fan of this method for solving for heating demand; https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heizlast . I ran the numbers on my \u201ccabane\u201d and found the heating demand is around 100W/\u00baC. Another rule of thumb I have seen is the 70*l* of storage per kw of biofuel heating capacity:\n\n> A well-insulated water tank will keep water hot for a few days until the water storage temperature drops. The size of the hot water storage can vary from 50-70 L/kW (4.0-5.5 U.S. gal/1,000 BTUh) of boiler input power depending on winter weather for small manual biomass boilers. Since it requires approximately 1 kilojoule (1 BTU) of heat to raise the temperature of 454 g (1 lb) of water by 0.55\u00b0C (1\u00b0F), a 2,250-L (600-U.S. gal) hot water storage tank operating with a design temperature difference of 22\u00b0C (40\u00b0F) will store 60 kWh (200,000 BTU). That volume of water storage can hold enough heat to meet the January average domestic heat load of a 205 m2 (2,200 ft2) home with good insulation located near Ottawa, Ontario, for 7 hr. Loading the biomass boiler twice a day will meet the peak daily demand if using a properly sized water storage tank. \u2013 http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/engineer/facts/14-009.htm#7\n\nI will admit I haven't checked your numbers out, and just providing this as another datapoint :smile:", "created_at": "2019-12-27 16:52:15.015548", "updated_at": "2019-12-27 16:52:15.015548", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 456, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 37.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [67947], "is_liked_by": [5, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12875, "user_id": 27, "topic_id": 1322, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>public swimming pools</b>\n\nhi and thank you very much for your comment. yes, it is a public swimming pool in west yorkshire, uk. it has been replaced by a newer, cleaner and bigger pool about 200 metres from the old one, hence i think the general satisfaction with the closure and the new pool being built. it is one of the fortunate cases though. another pool about 5 or so miles (8km) has been permanently closed with no replacement.\n\nin relation to alberto's mission report, i am 100% in support of open data, but i think he recognises that it is also a question of how it is used and an open dialogue around that data. perhaps the finer points of conversation and political weighing up of conflicting interests cannot be captured in data terms which is why i think the open government concept needs to also strive for\u00a0these qualitative aspects too.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-01 20:32:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:13.072364", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 161, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81580, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14230, "post_number": 4, "raw": "yes we can thank @owen for this excellent work.

To do this work we use a set of advanced technologies and methods for inducing and harnessing collective intelligence dynamics in online conversations.\n\nHaving a dense network around you is one of the hallmarks of social capital, and gives you access to expertise, resources, skill sharing and financing. In a dense network, there are many ways for you to get from one point to another. There are three challenges for building and making full use of such a network.\n\n* Ability of people with aligned interests to find and connect with one another amongst the crowd. \n* Accessing the knowledge and experience of others to get tangible benefits that incentivise continued engagement in the network (save time, money and energy or be enabled to do something that would otherwise not have been possible). \n* Establishing a culture of open entrepreneurial collaboration to generate income and tangible impact on the ground. \n\nFrom the perspective of a client or funder, the main challenge is how to unlock the capacity of individuals, groups and organisations to solve the issues that matter to them.\n\nEdgeryders was designed to meet these needs. Our solutions do not start from scratch - they build on 7 years of work we have done on building the enabling science, methods and technologies.\n\n---\n### Our tactics and technologies\nDense networks are not designed: they evolve.\n\n* **Start with \"viable mutants\".** We identify suitable initiatives that have achieved tangible initial progress. Many are already known to us through our extended networks.\n* **Provide conditions for expansion.** We support efforts efforts to secure resources for a scaled-up deployment of each initiative.\n* **Speed up the rates of adaptation.** We push initiatives out in the field early, encouraging prototyping and rapid learning. Knowledge sharing practices borrowed from open source hackers enable initiatives to imitate each other's tactics, further speeding up adaptation.\n* **Promote niche discovery and colonization.** Knowledge sharing institutions are a natural venue for initiatives to trade with each other. This promotes specialization into emerging niches in the ecosystem and enriches it.\n* **Enforce natural selection.** Initiatives that fail to complete any step of the process are dropped. Initiatives are encouraged and supported to become self-supporting by the end of the process.\n* **The technology that supports this evolution is the [Edgeryders stack](https://edgeryders.eu/t/data-science-collective-intelligence-technology/13472)**: an online platform technology, community management and open source digital tools to enable meaningful, purpose oriented dialogue and distributed collaboration over the internet amongst groups of varying size,  within as well as across organisational and geographic boundaries.\n* **Finally we document and disseminate the results widely**, seeking to challenge the prevailing narrative of how successful business ventures and ecosystems are born and sustained.\n---\n### Learn more\n* *[Video](https://start.edgeryders.eu/#mission)*\n* *[Minisite](http://hugi.se/openvillage)*\n* *Slides from public presentation: [Edgeryders Sensestack Tech Primer (1).pdf|attachment](upload://mccBFnwdf5zh8GujYy5k2kw5mPn.pdf) (3.5 MB)*\n* *Slides from public presentation: [Harvesting collective intelligence.pptx (1).pdf|attachment](upload://hXRoUSrgm8h480BH4AYvlJ7aRgN.pdf) (4.0 MB)* \n\n</Text>\n\n</Content>\n\n---\n\n<Content id=\"Section 2\">\n\n<Form account='true' topic='12345'>\n\n### Form Example\n\nThis is a form example.

I love discutions and debates, I always tended to argue for what I believed in, my memory served me rather well, I was always up for a challenge and bored when none presented itself and I actually like to speak in public.\u00a0\n\nI finished law school because I don't like to leave things unfinished. In my third year I started to doubt my chareer choice, but I thought that once I start working, everything will fall into place. Also in my third year I started volunteering in the students association, and eventually I lead the human resources department. Working close to people and figuring out their source of motivation and then fueling it helped me get through the last 2 years of school.\n\nI worked for two years as a trainee lawyer, and after I took all the exams demanded, I became a full on lawyer. I even got some pretty good work offers. But by that time, I realised that while idealistically speaking my reasons for choosing law made perfect sense, in real life they were just that: idealistic. And then, I realised that I am also a bit of an idealist myself. So, at 24 I was perfectly educated to work for the rest of my life in a field that has nothing to do with who I am.\u00a0I have to tell you, by this point I felt I was deep in a crisis.\n\nSo I did the only thing I could. I gave up being a lawyer and I started to search for something else. But I was a little bit torn to pieces so not much seemed to make sense. As it happened, I found an opportunity to become a volunteer for one year, in Serbia. This is where I'm writing from right now. I see this as a year to regroup. To find some answers, and hopefully a plan. I have been here for 8 months. I still don't know what I'll be doing next. And recently I did start to feel a little time pressure. Usually this helps. \u00a0\n\nI can't describe here all my ride, because I am in the middle of it, but I can't say I would change much until now. \u00a0Also, I don't know if by the end of the year I will find my answers and a good enough plan, but I most certainly managed to regroup. And as a bonus, even learn a thing or two.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-12 17:43:26", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 15:26:32.255489", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 475, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24412, "user_id": 800, "topic_id": 1575, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Forms Online ---&gt; Slides Offline</b>\n\nTiago, I like the form a lot!

This makes it possible to appreciate the role of supporting contexts, motivations and material practices.\n\nFrom a methodological perspective we can complement our competence in digital society studies at University of Turin with Edgeryders\u2019s semantic social network analysis and discourse analysis. \n\nHave a few potential partners in mind (by the way, the important point is the complementary of the individual rather that of institutions, and the possibility to demonstrate that the project\u2019s objectives are feasible thanks secondments). Edgeryders is however central, therefore, provided that I will take the lead of the proposal, I\u2019d like to have your opinion about it. \n\nIn practical terms, I suppose I will need some consultancy about the technical tasks that can be performed in Edgeryders, and some help with filling administrative formats.\n\nCheers", "created_at": "2020-08-12 14:12:07.003579", "updated_at": "2020-08-12 14:12:07.003579", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 387, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 92.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 4683, 3323, 4096, 4892], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62315, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 10769, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Hello @BlackForestBoi and @anon82932460,\n\nhere is the link to the files with the flyers for this event: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ChIZu_9jwqdzXdGixSqx-gDIq-jrs4Wi?usp=sharing", "created_at": "2019-10-25 21:12:19.624060", "updated_at": "2019-10-25 21:12:19.624060", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 20.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63208, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 11395, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## CZ\n\n1.

The application included a practical activity to map local farmers, in collaboration with the unMonastery project in Matera, South Italy. Our team made it to the 10 finalists, so we were invited to Brussels for the pitching and award ceremony. But in the end, we were not among the three winners.\n\nAfter that:\n\nIt turned out to be too difficult to turn the farmer mapping in Matera into a useful trade connection, esp. as our collaboration with Maria Pierra in Matera was new, we had challenges working remotely together.\n\nOn other fronts, we reached out to various governmental initiatives across Europe to evaluate potential collaborations. One contact to such a government-provided local food platform in Hessia, Gemany, seemed very promising: they had all the farmers on the platform, we had all the tech, and they were interested to collaborate. Then our contact person in that local government office suddenly died. Another contact with [Gutes vom Bauernhof](https://www.gutesvombauernhof.at/) in Austria provided a lot of inspirations (they have really good ideas and policies!), but ultimately did not result in an active collaboration.\n\nAround that time, I was in Nepal and came back with the idea to organize direct sales for farmers in Nepal instead \u2013 the potential improvement for a farmer's life is much higher there than in Europe, even with the modest trade volume that would be expected at first. That was the start of [Edgeryders powered coffee from Nepal](/t/id/6056), and by means of recursive problem solving lead to the current [open source optical coffee sorter](/t/id/7122) project.\n\nIn Europe, building a distribution network for local food means competing in the oligopolist food retail market, which is no match for a small company or network. So unless a major shift in consumer preferences or a major economic crisis happens, I see no opportunity for such a move.

We\u2019re flattering ourselves by believing that their existence was so grim and that our modern, civilized one is, by comparison, so great. Still, we are where we are, and we live the way we live, and it\u2019s possible to wonder whether any of this illuminating knowledge about our hunter-gatherer ancestors can be useful to us. Suzman wonders the same thing. He discusses John Maynard Keynes\u2019s famous 1930 essay \u201cThe Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren.\u201d Keynes speculated that if the world continued to get richer we would naturally end up enjoying a high standard of living while doing much less work. He thought that \u201cthe economic problem\u201d of having enough to live on would be solved, and \u201cthe struggle for subsistence\u201d would be over:\n\n'When the accumulation of wealth is no longer of high social importance, there will be great changes in the code of morals. We shall be able to rid ourselves of many of the pseudo-moral principles which have hag-ridden us for two hundred years, by which we have exalted some of the most distasteful of human qualities into the position of the highest virtues. We shall be able to afford to dare to assess the money-motive at its true value. The love of money as a possession\u2014as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life\u2014will be recognized for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease.'\n\nThe world has indeed got richer, but any such shift in morals and values is hard to detect. Money and the value system around its acquisition are fully intact. Greed is still good.\nThe study of hunter-gatherers, who live for the day and do not accumulate surpluses, shows that humanity can live more or less as Keynes suggests. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re choosing not to. A key to that lost or forsworn ability, Suzman suggests, lies in the ferocious egalitarianism of hunter-gatherers. For example, the most valuable thing a hunter can do is come back with meat. Unlike gathered plants, whose proceeds are \u201cnot subject to any strict conventions on sharing,\u201d hunted meat is very carefully distributed according to protocol, and the people who eat the meat that is given to them go to great trouble to be rude about it. This ritual is called \u201cinsulting the meat,\u201d and it is designed to make sure the hunter doesn\u2019t get above himself and start thinking that he\u2019s better than anyone else. \u201cWhen a young man kills much meat,\u201d a Bushman told the anthropologist Richard B. Lee, \u201che comes to think of himself as a chief or a big man, and he thinks of the rest of us as his servants or inferiors. . . . We can\u2019t accept this.\u201d The insults are designed to \u201ccool his heart and make him gentle.\u201d For these hunter-gatherers, Suzman writes, \u201cthe sum of individual self-interest and the jealousy that policed it was a fiercely egalitarian society where profitable exchange, hierarchy, and significant material inequality were not tolerated.\u201d\n\nThis egalitarian impulse, Suzman suggests, is central to the hunter-gatherer\u2019s ability to live a life that is, on its own terms, affluent, but without abundance, without excess, and without competitive acquisition. The secret ingredient seems to be the positive harnessing of the general human impulse to envy. As he says, \u201cIf this kind of egalitarianism is a precondition for us to embrace a post-labor world, then I suspect it may prove a very hard nut to crack.\u201d There\u2019s a lot that we could learn from the oldest extant branch of humanity, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to put the knowledge into effect. A socially positive use of envy\u2014now, that would be a technology almost as useful as fire.\"\n\nA hard nut to crack.  Yes it is.

There is. This is what Matthias Ansorg, the CTO of [Edgeryders](https://edgeryders.eu/), calls home.\n\nMatthias, who was once called \"a living synthesis of the arts\" by a friend \u2014 although he prefers systems engineering himself \u2014 lives an unconventional life, from making [his own DIY coffee beans processing equipment](https://edgeryders.eu/t/designing-an-open-source-coffee-roaster/7677) to building a foldable 3D printer to [working in Nepal after its 2015 earthquakes](https://edgeryders.eu/t/project-intro-future-makers-nepal/598) to publishing books on how to change your city into an ecological civilization.\n\n **&ldquo;I want to see how a civilization with zero ecological impact would be possible,&rdquo; he says.**\n\n\nThe drive to create a different kind of civilization has been a part of his life from when he was just a child, although Matthias can&rsquo;t really pin it to a specific moment. &ldquo;I was raised as a follower of Jesus Christ. And that&rsquo;s still where all my idealism and strong moral convictions come from,&rdquo; he explains, saying this value system is also exactly what prevents him from becoming a successful &ldquo;grown-up in this society,&rdquo; or in other words: He feels that philanthropic idealists don&rsquo;t seem to make it very far in a capitalist world.\n\nBut while living in a truck DIYing hardware solutions to live a more sustainable lifestyle and writing long manifests on [how we can create tech-based, eco-friendly societies](https://edgeryders.eu/t/an-autarky-system-for-cities/9141) may be called &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; by some, to Matthias it&rsquo;s exactly what he&rsquo;s supposed to do.\n<br>\n![044|690x690](upload://p5kXpL2m0Znnb6mMSeW7k0N8KGs.jpeg) \n<br>\n**Matthias decided to use himself as a guinea pig to show that a zero-consumption society is possible.** For him, living this life doesn&rsquo;t fix anything necessarily, but it&rsquo;s a method that at least doesn&rsquo;t make our world worse. If you have to carry your water and wastewater in 20 one-liter jerry cans in and out of a truck, you naturally adapt to changing your consumption behavior, Matthias explains.\n\nBeing as extremely tech-savvy as he is, all the solutions he&rsquo;s coming up with are based on what is technologically possible.\n\nThe truck Matthias lives in has 9 m\u00b2 living space, which he heats in winter with a bit of wood scraps (a carbon-neutral solution). Except for those two months in winter, he generates his electricity on the rooftop of his truck, with 400W PEAK solar panels.\n\n<br>\n\n_Using only 600-700 Wh of electricity a day, he consumes 90% less than the per-capita electricity consumption in Germany, the country where Matthias was born and raised. And he applies the same 90% reduction on water, buying &ldquo;new stuff,&rdquo; and trash generation._\n<br>\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on a plastic shredder and a foldable 3D printer \u2014foldable because it has to fit into my limited 9 m\u00b2 living space \u2014 to recycle all plastic trash into useful objects,&rdquo; Matthias says about his solutions.\n\nBut not all the ideas Matthias has worked on have worked out as he had initially planned. A hairdryer, for example, isn&rsquo;t the most efficient tool to remove the parchment shells of green coffee beans.\n\nMatthias had set up a peer-to-peer marketplace where [Nepalese coffee bean farmers could sell their products straight to the European customers](https://edgeryders.eu/t/now-theres-edgeryders-powered-coffee-from-nepal/6056). He wanted to pioneer &ldquo;globalization done right,&rdquo; leaving out the middlemen and supporting economic development.\n\nDue to miscommunication, unfortunately, the farmers sent over coffee beans that still needed their shells removed \u2014 and a hilarious event followed.\n<br>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pserEjyo9DA  \n\n<br>\n\n&ldquo;Here we have 300 kg of coffee that need to be processed with basically no equipment \u2014 and we find ourselves spending an afternoon cleaning coffee beans manually during a coffee hacking day at The Reef Brussels, Edgeryders&rsquo; co-working/co-living space,&rdquo; Matthias&rsquo; co-founder Nadia E. recalls. &ldquo;I still avoid drinking anything when I think about them for the health of my laptop.&rdquo;\n\nIt&rsquo;s exactly that trial and error, however, that make innovation and change possible, not only in creating new systems that could work but also in changing your mindset.\n\nHis colleagues speak highly of him, even though he sees himself as a &ldquo;misfit.&rdquo; Natalia, who he worked with in Nepal, says that his consistency in his life and ideals are admirable. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s truthful in a way few of us can be,&rdquo; she says, adding that our lifestyles are so often contradictory to what we preach and what we&rsquo;d want to see happen.\n\nHis work in Nepal \u2014 [where Edgeryders worked with UNDP Nepal to research, contact, and connect alternative leaders in Nepal](https://edgeryders.eu/c/workspaces/future-makers-nepal) using the Edgeryders platform \u2014 was what made a major impact on how Matthias sees the world and how he acts, especially when he returned to Europe after several months.\n<br>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/8-9Si0e6i78?rel=0\n<br>\n\n&ldquo;Nothing in Europe made sense anymore. All the luxury and resource waste felt just obscene, and, on top of that, Europe felt deeply miserable and hopeless,&rdquo; he says, adding that he feels he&rsquo;s an unusual person who&rsquo;s trying to make sense of the world differently from others he knows.\n\nThe difference in mentality in Nepal was especially striking to Matthias. The country, despite its poverty, felt hopeful. From a water pipe supplying a house with city water to a road being paved to a town, the people saw bits and pieces of progress and expected more process to be made.\n\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say they should feel hopeful; they&rsquo;re implementing the same type of wasteful, industrial, capitalist civilization that we got stuck in and that is implemented in more or less the same way everywhere on the planet. But I say, it feels so much better to feel hopeful! **Without hope, a lot of resentment soon becomes political mainstream as we can observe in Europe today**,&rdquo; Matthias explains.\n\nAnd that is why he thinks we should rebuild civilization from scratch, while he&rsquo;s doing some foundational work hoping to inspire others to make it really happen.\n\nHe&rsquo;s hopeful. From a tech perspective, physics allows us humans to change our behaviors significantly. As an example, he mentions how much energy the sun radiates to Earth every day, but it won&rsquo;t be without a massive effort from everyone.\n\n&ldquo;When the ecological transition actually starts, it&rsquo;ll be hard work for everyone. But it&rsquo;s meaningful work, and people will love it because it gives them hope and because they can leave their bullshit jobs behind,&rdquo; says Matthias.", "created_at": "2019-09-17 11:46:56.838042", "updated_at": "2019-10-28 23:04:26.632171", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1243, "wiki": true, "reads": 40, "score": 2378.0, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4022, 5201, 137, 3206, 5, 3, 3782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56825, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10367, "post_number": 6, "raw": "@anon82932460 flagging for you @noemi's promotion needs for call for czech local connectors", "created_at": "2019-07-17 14:56:39.493019", "updated_at": "2019-07-17 14:56:39.493019", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [56803], "is_liked_by": [4986], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56435, "user_id": 5211, "topic_id": 9874, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Jako nejv\u011bt\u0161\u00ed p\u0159\u00ednos politick\u00e9 korektnosti pova\u017euju fakt, \u017ee se sna\u017e\u00ed neposilovat kli\u0161\u00e9 a stereotypy ve ve\u0159ejn\u00e9 debat\u011b (kter\u00e9 odv\u00e1d\u011bj\u00ed pozornost od v\u011bcnosti).

Setting up chruby for a new website\n\n**Summary.** You have nothing to do to enable `chruby` for a new website, and only have to create a suitable `.ruby-version` file to activate one of the installed Rubies that `chruby` manages.
