I always went to an office, except for 2 years in 2004-5 when I worked for a Finnish game company. That was all remote, since I was in California, but the work was for me to be online all the time as a kind of adult supervisor for a large bunch of teens online.  So the work itself was on display for anyone to see.  I didn't have to collaborate on reports, didn't have to co-create budgets, didn't have many meetings outside of the platform itself.\n\nI am a big believer in those who do work remotely with each other to offer to each other various aspects of their lives so that they may get to know each other better.  However, besides a short pause to mention the cat or whatever, I think video meetings can lose track of how fast an hour goes by, so in that case some discipline is called for.\n\nBut on a platform such as this one, there is plenty of real estate for someone to show a fuller version of themselves by talking about or showing something from other parts of their lives, things they like, movie and other cultural recommendations, and similar things. There is no requirement that one's co-workers must read that other stuff if they don't want to.  And, speaking personally, I would very much like to know other people who congregate on this platform and I do not want to go off to some social media space to accomplish it.\n\nOne thing I have learned over the years is that writing clearly and succinctly is a skill that takes practice to learn.  Word economy is and will always be important.  Set the scene, make your point or tell the story, and stop.  I thought I was pretty good at it a long time ago untilI went back and read some of the stuff I wrote in the early years..\n\nOne of the things I advise people in online community building is to \"oversupply understanding\" which really means to cut the other person some slack because they might not have said perfectly what they really meant to say.  Not doing that can result in jumping to a conclusion that alienates or polarizes.\n\nAt the same time, I think that if co-workers are going to critique each other, which I think is pretty necessary in a team finding its rhythm, on the other side I think it important to acknowledge the good things in the other person, or the validity of what they might be saying, or the parts that you think are valid.  One could call it praise; I would call it affirmation.  Has nothing to do with software.  In other words, if you want to improve bonding and strengthen relationships via online communication, given the lack of other cues - body english, voice nuance, facial expression - you should come up with other, less subtle ways of strengthening those bonds.  I find it costs nothing to let someone know when you think they are doing something right, or you like the way they handled a situation, or made a good comment or presentation.  I wouldn't overdo it, but don't hold back.", "created_at": "2019-12-06 20:41:42.660280", "updated_at": "2019-12-07 01:11:44.865140", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 580, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 98.8, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 5698, 5, 5538, 4, 5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54986, "user_id": 4986, "topic_id": 10122, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Gained access to FB.

But this pendulum has swung back and forth with congress and the intelligence committee since the 1970s. I'm sure it will continue.\n\nI was referencing the Apple/FBI fight after the 2015 San Bernardino shooting. If you remember, the FBI used the courts to try to make Apple hand over information - essentially forcing open a back door. Apple changed iMessage encryption after this incident, which offers two advantages.\n\n1. They can't hand over keys if they don't have them.\n2. They can't build a backdoor if they don't even have a front door.\n\nI don't have any predictions about how this will play out in the future, but this is the precedent from the last five years. So it makes sense that Apple would adopt a technology where they have no access to user data. It's the safest for them.\n\nI can certainly see a day where lawmakers try and force Apple to build a less secure iMessage.

So I have kept in these two requirements, even though the authoritative source (with the damn auditable log) can only be SignRequest, still.\n\nThe effect is that we cannot use the SignRequest Templates feature but need to sign different documents every month for every collaborator. And there is the manual work on the Edgeryders admin side of combining them with the bills and adding that to FreeAgent.\n\nSo in total we have a pretty awful process now and I don't see a way to improve it (SignRequest [attachments](https://help.signrequest.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003506005) and [team accounts](https://help.signrequest.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002640565) do not make anything better). Still I propose we keep the process as it is, except @marina finds that the manual workload it creates is totally unacceptable.\n\nIn that case, if we really want a proper process with the current features _and_ low manual workload, we could create a custom tool using both the FreeAgent and SignRequest APIs. But then, instead of investing that work and money into a special-purpose tool that connects two arbitrary SaaS solutions, we'd be better off to develop something based on [the Kimai v2 open source time tracking platform that I looked into above](/t/9143/33).

Someone else then posted a photo of his house on the California beach showing the ocean waves. He made some comment about it and I said \u201cno surfing in Idaho.\u201d because there is no ocean there.\n\nFor that FB suspended my account claiming that my comment was harassment and bullying. Of course it was nothing like that, but people seem to not be making those decisions - bots do. Ok, we all know that. What bothers me is what came after.\n\nThey told me I was suspended and they let me walk through a process where I could dispute it. At the end of that they just noted that I disagreed with their decision, without indicating that anyone or anything on the other side even looks at it. Then I picked my way to a form where I could describe the situation, with the idea that someone would actually read it and perhaps override the bot. Except that when I got through they said that function was not working and to try again later. Which I did for hours until I went to bed. So I reported that as a bug since their support structure was not working.\n\nA few hours later my ban was lifted without explanation. So does that mean someone saw my argument and reversed the decision? I have no way of knowing because they have not communicated with me about that.\n\nI find this all quite disturbing because millions of people have given over a big chunk of their daily lives to this platform that acts with impunity based on robotic decisions and makes no effort to communicate with the user, even though they constantly tell me \u201cwe care about you.\u201d\n\nSo this part of social media is for sure broken.  And it is to me an example of the creeping influence of bots making human decisions.  @alberto pointed out to me that Facebook is too large - 2 billion people can't be managed.  And I agree, I think. Except they have billions of dollars and could afford to do a decent job if they really wanted to.\n\nUltimately though, I believe the answer is to allow we the people to have more direct control over our own experience.  Why can I not be my own content moderator?  Why do I, nearly 70 years old and in this business for 34 years, need a censor, or need to be censored?  They could provide a number of tools to help me improve my experience.\n\nBut that it seems, would hinder their business model and it gives more control to me and less to Facebook.  This they will never agree to unless forced.\n\nWhich brings me to one more point.  When power companies and phone companies first got started they were private companies that could do whatever they wished.  But over time electricity and telephone service became so important to society that they could not be left to the whims of the companies and instead became publicly regulated utilities.\n\nI think this is where we are now with social media.", "created_at": "2020-08-13 16:30:17.247123", "updated_at": "2020-08-13 16:30:17.247123", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 536, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 52.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75789, "user_id": 4897, "topic_id": 13309, "post_number": 39, "raw": "@erik_lonroth @MariaEuler I posted an invite (also freely translated to Swedish) on the DFRI blog here: https://www.dfri.se/webbinarium-own-your-cloud/", "created_at": "2020-05-06 04:54:24.953136", "updated_at": "2020-05-06 04:54:24.953136", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 24, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 48.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 4022, 5025], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74651, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 12973, "post_number": 23, "raw": "[quote=\"matthias, post:2, topic:12973\"]\nI would like to find some ideas along the lines of \u201cinteresting, enjoyable, trust-building or otherwise valuable activities to do online for a date\u201d.

In fact, they are geared toward social/cultural norms *more* than general-purpose institutions, because they go up fast, with little regard for minorities etc. In this case, the norm is your usual live-in married couple. Anything else, from participating in a dating scene to [living apart together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_apart_together) or consensual non-monogamy, is not catered for. \n\nSmall anecdote: recently, a Flemish TV show on how ordinary people live out their quarantine interviewed a member of the polyamorous community. By sheer coincidence, immediately after her, the same program interviewed [Marc van Ranst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Van_Ranst), the epidemiologist leading the committee for national security that determines Belgium's lockdown measures. The host asked van Ranst if he had polyamorous people in mind when he designed those rules. He replied he has the utmost respect for our choices, but, actually, no, he did not think about that at all. You can see the whole thing (in Dutch) [here](https://vtm.be/vtmgo/afspelen/ef90c98da-bb3a-4581-9b4b-7764ae534503).\n\nSo, and of course, poly folks are turning to the Internet to try to save their connections from wearing out.

So how many will show up if it requires 2-3 days of full-time work on top of travel &amp; accomodation?\n\n@Alberto is right about the inflation aspect though: LOTE4 related offers and orders will not or nearly not mix with the rest of the Makerfox value network, as it is a set of direct barter exchanges. In this situation, \"inflationary\" pricing is ok and does not break anything: only the LOTE4 user will order translation jobs or similar for 500 EUR a day. This would normally make it difficult for the algorithm to find matches at all (since direct barter is improbable, and we lack a critical mass of people as well), but in this case we can solve it with an idea from @Noemi of introducing a limited number of price steps for users' offers for LOTE4: like, for quarter, half, three quarters and full amount of the ticket price.\n\nSo, for the software it should work.

I stopped writing a diary for quite a while back and I\u2019m losing out on a lot. But I also want to share a lot of the things I learned and it keeps amassing, more than I can possibly remember back on. So I figured keeping a live journal of my learnings would be cool and it would also decentralize my brain!\n\nToday I\u2019ve dived into the world of blockchains and there are two main outputs from this.\n\n1. Is a reflection on Libra, the crypto that Facebook is developing.\n\n    I\u2019ve realized that even though they say that they\u2019re going to distribute the shares or distribute the ownership of Libra to whoever has a stake in the blockchain or in the token, they also have Minimum stake of 10 million dollars to have access, which means that even though it sounds like they\u2019re creating a cryptocurrency that can be used by the people (and they\u2019ll probably have some great marketing scheme for this) in the end Libra, Facebook\u2019s new crypto currency which is to be released in 2020, will instead of having Banks as the central Powers it will simply turn the big tech groups into the market owners. I think Amazon has already bought into it, so has Lyft and Uber, I don\u2019t remember maybe Tesla as well. But yeah, Facebook\u2019s to Creator and won\u2019t do anything good, even though it may really seem like it when they start giving away \u201cfree\u201d money to promote the currency.\n\n2. The second thing I learned about today was interoperability of Blockchains and there are two projects out there right now. The first ones called.\n\n    Huh? I forgot the name of it...\n\n    Either way, the second one is called Cosmos. The first one (which I forgot the name of) is simply a proof of stake which basically means that the ownership is proven by putting in money, which once again equates to a power distribution to those who have wealth. So I\u2019m not too keen on that. But the second one, Cosmos, seems to also use some form of proof of social stake, which I find more interesting.\n\n    So what\u2019s exciting me about this is in creating interoperability between Blockchains is that it also creates interoperability between systems. Currently the way we tend to think about digital infrastructure is very singular. We have one internet. And especially now that I\u2019m coming from the space of the distributed webs I see that there\u2019s such a richness to be found in the multitude. And especially when there can be collaboration. So what\u2019s exciting me about interoperability of block chain is that it also means diversity and it means multiple solutions. Rather than a singular potentially very fragile system of a centralized solution.\n\nSo yeah, those are the two things I\u2019ve learned today and I\u2019m trying out this new Thinking Out Loud into a transcription service thing. So let me know if you like it. And if you don\u2019t, maybe don\u2019t let me know because it\u2019ll hurt my ego, but Yeah. I\u2019m kind of keen on developing how I can harness the knowledge generated from each day. Maybe in more fun ways.\n\nYes, Zenna checking out.\n\ud83c\udf38 \u2728", "created_at": "2019-11-21 01:54:11.114959", "updated_at": "2019-11-21 13:47:28.931430", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 559, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 126.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 4892, 8, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19152, "user_id": 31, "topic_id": 2001, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>pyramids and onions</b>\n\nAnother metaphor I've found useful is pyramid/onion.

Linear economy kind of grew historically out of the industrial revolution(s - especially amplification of power through burning of fossil fuels), the topology and thinking of the industrial sector (esp in the \"West\") is based on this linear/exponental(one way, always down stream) inspired mentality that developed in the last 2-300 years. ER thinks differently and thus can solve problems you can't easily solve with \"one way thinking tools\".\n\nICT is a special case in my opinion. Not in that it is different there but in that it is WORST there. Not in terms of the architecture we run (networks), but in the manufacturing. The supply chain is very sensitive (and not insignificant in size and complexity). But more importantly the externalities are gigantic. The energy for cooking that silicon and then processing it in 300 steps - not much of that lends itself well for CE. Recycle a chip? Have fun with that. Here we may actually need to stick with the linear approach for a while. But we could (and in my opinion should) design ICT hardware that lasts 100 years to ameliorate the problem. We could certainly reuse them. The other thing is that we should use it where is makes sense - not necessarily a smartphone in every 10 year old's hands (or OLPC) every 3 years. Most electronic circuits need 80% of cost (energy) at production and 20% in use. A car for example is the other way around.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-07 12:15:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:36.922708", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 300, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27863], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11323, "user_id": 1511, "topic_id": 1944, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Contact</b>\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would need introductions to schools and time to explain the project to teachers and head teachers.This should be seen as widening the scope of the Un monastery, a positive step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I presume all schools have classrooms but we would need spaces to make things if model are to be made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-14 14:03:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:05.401839", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 70, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8048], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80558, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14051, "post_number": 7, "raw": "", "created_at": "2020-07-15 13:45:08.542541", "updated_at": "2020-07-15 13:45:08.542541", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8765, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1570, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>thinking..</b>\n\nHi Edmund,\n\nWow, this is new approach.. what you are saying is that <strong>even though processes of learning change and opportunities expand, teaching as profession shouldn't or doesn't change in the normative sense</strong>? actually you are nuancing a little what other Edgeryders have said and experienced digitally, about the whole internet learning mirage.

We figured a good way to do this is to reach out to and partnering with coworking spaces to organise local events in the countries we have decided to focus on as a first step. The topics that were preferred by our community managers connect well with some of the topics touched on during the coworking event: Provision for childcare, family/work-life balance, coliving and coworking spaces adapting to local needs offering valuable services (for which we have follow up editorialised content from the documentation coming soon). \n\n   * Poland: \n       * work & employment + family/work-life-balance,\n       * reproductive rights (e.g. abortions, contraception, etc.)\n   * Czechia\n       * health and social care and \n       * the housing issues\n   * Serbia (t.b.c)\n\n2. **Activities in NGI:** Here it makes sense to pick up on the solarpunk and role of tech for/within context of deep green transition topics, Open Source Software.\n\n    We also have the topics/discussions we have had that are relevant to an international audience, and for which it would be good to run follow up activities (perhaps also within the POPREBEL exchange program: food businesses, remote/new work post covid, coworking sector, digital services & infrastructure, the future of work and life in the context of the green transition.\n\n3. **New covid reality adaptation projects** We are continuing/going further in our activities to engage people already in the community into meaningful covid community responses. We have several projects which realy could help people if we can channel enough energy/get them off the ground.\n \n   * 3.a  **Policymaking: Alternative Regional Development**. We want to engage policymakers to engage with citizens in exploring alternative local economic development models to facilitate thriving communities/ enable the green transition.

Then, the app on your phone will pass a randomised anonymous key (which will change many times a day) to all other phones running the app within a few yards of you, wherever you are (and vice versa). If, after a few weeks, you test positive, you tell the app (presumably with medical verification), which tells a central cloud service, and every other phone in the region checks the keys they've seen in the last 14 days against that service, and if there's a match they can say 'you've been exposed'.

What do you think @amelia noemi about helping with this? \n\n**Context for the proposed actions:**\n\n@Martin: Lives in a small community in Germany, where he needs to coordinate efforts between people who use landline phones or simple mobiles (not smartphones), as well as explain the concept of exponential growth to people who are making important decisions in the community (e. Local officials) He will purchase an open video room that is always open and accessible and invites others to meet in the video room. Then look at how to manage it. Needs help with: 1) Find a good way to coordinate for mixed teams where some do not use the internet or smartphones and 2) Find good, easy to understand explanations and examples to explain exponential growth which is a counterintuitive concept for many 3) Structured activities for using the video room (@KatarinaBtc suggestion)\n\n@Mstn: Is based in Italy, (where - rural? Urban? Small/Big population?). He is building an open source mobile application to make it easier for people to avoid queues at the supermarkets by making it easier to find and buy from small local places that offer home delivery. The objective is to collect information and make it easily available in your phone, as well as establish its use enough that people continue to buy from small local shops even after the crisis is over.  There are initiatives that are doing this to some extent, but they have a number of issues. They tend to be map based which Marco feels is not a good interface for the purpose, hyperlocal and only available in some places e.g Milan or Bologna. Also, some of what he has come across e.g a guy in Rome collecting google modules may work for the short term, but we need to think further (privacy concernsI guess? Something else?) Needs help with: 1) Reaching out to existing initiatives and encouraging them to use the app 2) Reaching out to a lot of people to compile lists of shops in their neighbourhoods and upload the information into the database. Ideas- add functionality/ interface for people who want to volunteer to deliver food to keep costs low for small shop owners. \n\n\n@katerinabc is offering support with her data analysis skills (need the audio recording to make good notes)\n\n@Ichraf:  Runs a creative/coworking space in Tunisia and has been involved in hosting OCI Lab activities in it. There is a big established community around the space of people who want to build things in response to the pandemic (how many? What skillsets?). Some want to work on apps for Corona. Some are experimenting with 3-D printing masks. Others are developing software for localisation of people who might be ill. Ichraf needs to find a different business model to secure commitment from the members and the membership fees. Perhaps move some of the activities online. The first challenge here is content - the OCI Lab webinar screenings had high attendance and that the content and format appealed to her community : \u201cIn Tunisia people don\u2019t communicate in writing much\u201d. Another is that of payment. She is considering delaying collection of payment until after the crisis as it is difficult to collect money digitally in Tunisia.  People do not trust neither online payment nor mobile payment systems - they do not trust that they will not get cheated/robbed. Ichraf needs help with: 1) Finding the right content and activities to keep her coworking community active and committed now that they cannot use the physical space 2) Finding a way to collect/manage payment when people do not trust putting their fiat money into digital or mobile platforms.\n\n@Kajafarszky: Described the situation in the performing arts/cultural sector. In many ways there are parallels to what @jasen_lakic and @matteo_uguzzoni were describing with board games.

It starts describing him pitching the need for China-level surveillance in order to compete with China.  I thought at first that Ms Klein was overhyping her point until i scrolled down to the slides Schmidt used to pitch his vision.  Based on what is in it, I don't doubt that Trump likes this guy and his vision.  It brushes privacy and the public's rights aside if it wants to be like China.  He calls mass surveillance a \"killer app for deep learning\" and touts the virtues of a city \"carpeted with cameras.\"\n\nAnd of course these Smart Services will be brought to us via outfits like Sidewalk Labs which almost wired up the Toronto waterfront as a Smart City area, but the city dropped it over privacy questions from the public along with not enough apparent public benefit.  But Sidewalk and all have moved on and are now working up something bigger with New York and Governor Cuomo.\n\nAnd we know that some services that require high info tech can be deployed in ways that protect privacy. And of course we know about Rob's disposable identity project.  And I could imagine a guy like Schmidt paying attention and value into ensuring the rights of people. But surveillance made him a billionaire and he has no track record that I know of in placing high value on the privacy and rights of individuals.\n\nInto this comes the pandemic. Whereas that vision for the urgent need to adopt mass surveillance tech was pitched as a national security issue, suddenly there is this pivot toward using these same tech companies and their technologies as benevolent bringers of our survival needs.  And Schmidt is pitching the tech for education, home health, etc etc..  It reminds me of the \"atoms for peace\" program that got shoved down our throats in the 50s when it was really always about nuclear weapons.  But bomb shelters were scaring people and by the way not selling, so then it was decided to embark on all these huge projects to show us what a friend the uranium atom really is.  I remember it all quite well.\n\nScary essay.  I know Naomi Klein, author of \"The Shock Doctrine\" can serve up a large dose of shock herself, and in this she delivers.  I hope she is wrong, but I think she is correct.\n\n@pbihr I wonder what your thoughts are..? \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/13/naomi-klein-how-big-tech-plans-to-profit-from-coronavirus-pandemic", "created_at": "2020-05-19 00:54:50.553741", "updated_at": "2020-05-19 18:42:16.333320", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 529, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 34.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6400], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44835, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 8534, "post_number": 40, "raw": "It never ceases to amazing me how small this world is", "created_at": "2018-05-16 13:33:23.186257", "updated_at": "2018-05-16 13:33:23.186257", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 39, "score": 12.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [44830], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74763, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 274, "raw": "It is, and I am pretty sure it will never come to anything close to that.

This is an interesting remark, and will reflect on it. There is a thin line between living in your home and living in a project, and The Reef might be more of a home for some, and more of a project for others. That should be OK, that's also where diversity comes into play. Not everyone needs to be 'active' or social necessarily, if you ask me. Introverts, busy people, or more precarious ones, or people who have their own lives and are not so community oriented should have a space in this whole thing. of course, that means that others might need to compensate for that in order for the Reef to make an impact. But i'm not so worried. In this case, a facilitator would just act to optimise the opportunities for participation, but not to get everyone to be or act in a certain way. A community should survive with those different personalities, otherwise it will be a project.

That post would be easy to break down by result, coming down to 5 posts.

A social contract\n\n1) This form of care is designed to outlive the individual initiators, and has a clear strategy towards sustainability, or the necessary situational awareness to navigate through changes preserving the right to care of its beneficiaries.\n\n1bis) This form of care is designed to work as a catalyzer, it may remain available an arbitrarily short period of time, and it is explicitly meant at raising awareness and/or teaching coping or problem solving strategies and/or passing the responsibility of care onto well identified existing organizations, rather than offering outright care in the traditional, entrusting sense.\n\n_[Signatories are meant to delete either #1 or #1bis.]_\n\n2) Care offered by our team/s is designed with you based on information that has been, and will be tested for validity concerning both its effectiveness and safety. Our partners and we commit to publicly discussing our practices, to be transparent and to have the opportunity of discovering what could be done better/differently.\n\n3) We commit to transparency about our funding streams, and we commit to procuring and managing resources adhering to the ethical standards we apply in all our activities, and in measure to sustain the continuity of our action, designing adequate fallback strategies should causes of force majeure cut us short of planned funding.\n\n4) We have designed this initiative with our community in mind, we struggle to maintain space and opportunities for everyone of you to join us and use, or ethically misuse what we maintain, so that the forms and offers of care existing here could evolve with the community itself. We are aware we cannot do everything alone, but we can facilitate you doing your part.\n\n5) We put in place every measure within our means to support your conscious participation to the production of the desired outcomes, and to support you in behavior changing and maintenance. However, we will never deny your access to care from us, as long as fall within the community we care for, as it is transparently stated and advertised in our statute.\n\n6) We may enforce temporary restrictions to your access to care, under those circumstances in which your behavior represents an acute risk for the care providers (e.g.: violent or otherwise threatening behaviors), or whenever your behavior poses an absolute barrier to the achievement of the goal of said care, until modified (e.g.: requirement of discontinuation of alcohol abuse before accessing organs availability lists).\n\n7) We devote ourselves to care, and we are aware that the very objective and meaning of care evolve with the vision of the world of individuals and community. Thus, we commit to continuing independent evaluation of our activities, and to turning any breach or near miss consequently identified into the awareness of a changing landscape that would guide an evolution of our operations and governance. We invite all our members and users to raise a flag and report those instances in which needs required work-arounds, not because we aim to police the ethical dimension of your behavior, but because we want to rethink with you our rules and principles in order to find ways to accommodate the unmet needs you spotted in the most transparent and widely acceptable form possible.\n\n8) This care initiative may produce value that we do not map at a given time, as instance data or intellectual property. Our priority is the satisfaction of some fundamental, infrastructural needs for the wellbeing of our community, and we need to be sustainable, and we want to exert a multiplicative effect of our activities and yours. Hence, we invite all of you to participate to our periodic strategic exercises sharing your personal insights about our value chain. Third parties, exploiting our lack of awareness, and ultimately you and us, can scavenge value that gets ignored. We want to channel all the values and transactions generated within our initiative like ancient civilization would do with water, to ensure prosperity and sustainability for the entire community today and in the future. Sometimes this will mean that aspects of what we do will chose moderated form of openness, over the radical form some of us would favour. We will always be ready to engage with you in explaining and rethinking the reasons behind this, and the tradeoffs between benefits and pitfalls.

There are a lot of valid points in there.\n\nFrom my point of view, these would be the most relevant points:\n\n* _Contracts are not laws of physics._ What I mean by that is that putting things in contracts does not make them magically possible. Looking back, it seems like I simply should have said \"no\" to the proposed contract, as there was simply no way to guarantee all of the deliverables. (E.g. it is impossible to be accountable for 3rd part onboarding as you can't force external parties to go somewhere.) However, I truly wonder if rejecting the contract would have helped the project more than simply ignoring those aspects. The whole thing reminds me of a line in one of my poems: \"You never should have said yes. And I never should have asked you.\"\n* As was evident after Alberto's talk, there was truly a misunderstanding regarding the use of this communication platform. A good lesson of everyone.\n* More personally, and perhaps this deserves a face to face conversation, I often didn't feel like I was working in a team, but rather being directed in a very hierarchical way. Considering the external image of Edgeryders, this feels like an enormous mismatch. It also triggers all sorts of anti-authoritarian reflexes in me. I'm wondering if this is something you've run into before, as you probably attract quite a few people with my style of neurodiversity ;)\n\nAll that being said, I truly loved this conference and really believe it will have a massively positive effect on the climate effort.

I found the commentary to the contract's articles very helpful for me to engage with the document). I have two comments.\n\n### Social contract for open care initiatives or social contract for OpenCare?\n\nThis is kind of internal to OpenCare as a project. The social contract is mentioned in our proposal and Grant Agreement as deliverable D4.5. It is described like this:\n\n> A draft explicit social contract for community-driven care services design, aimed at removing exploitation from the participatory design picture. This is done by styling the community as a collective author and researcher, rather than a \"rightless volunteer\", like in most crowdsourcing exercises.\n\nSo, I was expecting a sort of TOS for contributing to OpenCare. Over 300 people contributed their experiences, ideas and wisdom to OpenCare. How do we credit them? How are we accountable to them? What promises can we reasonably make? Which rights do they have? \n\nInstead, this seems to be a kind of constitution for someone wishing to provide community care _services_. Don't get me wrong, it's super-interesting, but it does leave me a bit confused. Was there some shift in focus I missed? Am I looking at something other than D4.5? \n\n### Is community care necessarily best-effort?\n\nThe second comment takes the social contract for what it is. It is this: it seems there is an untenable tension between the document's ethical reach and the reality of community-provided care as we see it in OpenCare. For example, article 5 and its commentary state that access to care can not be restricted, as it is a human right. Article 6 and commentary invoke independent oversight. Article 3 commits to funding transparency, and it does so in a language that strikes me:\n\n>[...] we commit to procuring and managing resources adhering to the ethical standards we apply in all our activities, and in measure to sustain the continuity of our action, designing adequate fallback strategies should causes of force majeure cut us short of planned funding. \n\nAll of this sounds distinctly unlike the open care initiatives I have in mind from participating in the OpenCare conversation. What sort of transparency can the Cytostatic network, which is essentially underground, commit to? What happens when the Helliniko Community Clinic doctors and volunteers are exhausted and burned out, and still people in need of care come? What standards can they secure? And if Buoy or Woodbine fail to deploy risk mitigation strategies (for example taking on insurance), does this mean they are failing? \n\nI am not convinced of all this. As far as  I can see, community care initiatives are, technically, \"best effort\" services. \"We will do our best, but cannot commit to a minimum standard. Moreover, it is not fair that you expect one from us, we are doing our best here.\" \n\nThese initiatives seem to emerge to meet immediate and urgent needs, and everybody seems clear that best effort is better than what's available right now. They remind me of Amartya Sen's discourse on justice: there is a large difference, he claims, between advancing the cause of justice (for example, by stopping people from deporting innocent children of illegal immigrants) and designing a system of perfect justice. Community care initiatives are Sen-ian that way: they improve the care panorama, but cannot possibly take on the delivery of a flawless system of care \u2013 and they don't seem to think that is their job anyway. See, for example, the insistence of the Helliniko crowd that \"they do not want to replace a national health service, they want to push it to be more inclusive, humane and efficient\". A good, complete care system is desirable, but it's someone else's job to deliver it. \n\nCoda on this: transparency, accountability and risk mitigation are all great things, but they are also overhead. In Europe's welfare states, national health services are required to have all this. But then they struggle to maintain financial viability, universality of coverage, or both. And this resonates also in the jurisprudence around human rights: social rights are \"left hanging\". We have a right to care as humans, but _nobody has an obligation to provide care to humans as such_, bar exceptions. If a person has cancer and no health insurance and no assets in the wrong country, that person will die. Nobody will necessarily go to jail for dereliction of duty. \n\nSo, maybe, community care can only be best effort. It is what makes it efficient and fast. Asking these initiatives to behave as if they were regular hospitals means, effectively, saying they should not exist.

However, as the reflection about how to define \"open care\" that sprouted within the community in the first semester demonstrated, once we reached out to the deepest layers of community driven care, we discovered a fairly different world. Often short lived initiatives, with little to no organised value channelling, and hence little governable exploitation, almost an absence of explicit design, substituted by a mechanism of reactions, and trials-and-errors. As in a iceberg, what had been visible to us at the beginning, including the cases like Helliniko Community Clinic that you mention later in your comment, were just the tip, and the smallest portion of the entire ecosystem.\n\nIn conversation with successful and failed initiatives from the field, we realised the social contract that would be needed is much more radical than just a way to agree about the traceability of contribution, and redistribution of value. What value would you even redistribute, if most initiatives have never figured out what's their value chain, and systematically disperse the value generated, sometimes wasting opportunities, because of a lack of time for reflection (it's easy to talk from my office, but if I had been in Nepal in 2015 I would have started helping where possible, trying to coordinate at a very superficial level my actions), sometimes for cultural barriers (the known unknowns of someone, may not be so well known to someone else), always for the lack of an infrastructure of support, knowledge transfer, mentoring, across domains and initiatives...\n\nSo... what you look at in article #8, is what the original path materialised into, and if you do not recognise it's clarity of explanation about how to deal with value as a step in the direction of each initiative discussing with its community \nhow to deal with traceable and non-traceable contributions, we may amend it, or write a #9 together (this is way we invite a conversation)...\nHowever, a \"social contract\" only devoted to this aspect, in the face of the complexity community driven care initiatives are facing out there, would really just be a TOS for our project (which we never wanted to do, hence the title of the deliverable), and not a social contract... What is the social contract that binds together all the values shared and exposed in a community driven care initiative? People who have experienced loss due to failing initiatives, or contributors who have suffered burn-out, or who were haunted by doubts about the meaning of their commitment,even people seeing their projects \"successful\" but not acknowledged, supported, or replicated, ...they sought a different reflection than we expected at the beginning, what we set sails to do being just a fraction of it.\n\nNow, to the pragmatic part, would you propose changes to article 8, or would you rather a 9, or 10 added somewhere? \n\nThe Deliverable is frozen in time for bureaucratic reasons, but the editors wrote its text hoping that this could be used, and misused (in the sense of used beyond our initial purposes) by the communities... a living and evolving document.", "created_at": "2017-09-06 19:12:30.017864", "updated_at": "2017-09-06 19:12:30.017864", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 690, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 13.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [35653], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 870, "user_id": 3400, "topic_id": 837, "post_number": 1, "raw": "August 2016, Breathing Games took part to the <a href=\"/en/op3ncare-community-groupnode/welcome-to-openandchange-care-an\">Open &amp; Change Care</a> application to MacArthur's Foundation.\n\nApril 2017, we were selected for a two-weeks residence in Milan, organized by <a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu\">EdgeRyders</a>, <a href=\"http://wemake.cc/\">WeMake</a> and <a href=\"http://opencare.cc/\">OpenCare</a>.\n\nWe document our residence in following spaces.

It strikes me that no one from the people we are in touch with running care initiatives felt our language \"binding\" as apparently you read it. I wonder if it was the effect of having a conversation around it.\n\nI will start from the sentence you put in quotation marks \"We will do our best, but cannot commit to a minimum standard. Moreover, it is not fair that you expect one from us, we are doing our best here.\"\nI have heard it.\nSeveral months later, I have met people operating in this project in burn-out and doubting what they had been doing. \n\n\"We are doing our best here\" is the operational regime of emergency... even within institutional care (that's why triage exists, and all sorts of rules about whom to care first, and whom to save when you have to make a choice...). However, community driven care initiatives are not all emergency initiatives, and most of them really are not. Once you strive to become the reference point of a community for something (a service, most of the times in open care), your modality of work changes, your relationship with those people becomes deeper, richer, and more complex. Mistakes, losses, abandon, exact a toll on them, and on you. As well as accusations of collusion with groups of power (I still remember the loss of trust when Italy tried to force doctors to report illegal migrants), systematic imposition of arbitrary treatments, or racial/faith discrimination. You are there to help, at the beginning, but failing these dimensions transforms the meaning of your commitment, and erodes you and the initiative.\n\nOf course, we could have written a simpler social contract for completely unregulated care initiatives: skin in the game. Everyday doctors and nurses are threatened when they refuse something, or when they are thought guilty of mistakes, of malevolence... many of the issues in the social contract we propose are regulated by \"natural selection\"  of the care givers, or the beneficiaries, according to circumstances...\n\nHowever, every initiative can strive to do better, and we have never met one that said \"we don't want a safety net\" or \"we don't want to be transparent\"... this are not overheads. Overheads is implementing these dimensions into box-ticking mechanisms, and other bureaucratic implementations. Organizing in groups, recognising the need for lean documentation, guaranteeing room for conversation and expertise transfer, ... this is also \"care\" for the community, because if the care-givers need to love the feeling of heroism to provide care, its meaning will soon change.\n\nCommunity care is best effort, but best effort doesn't necessarily mean that there is no space to reflect on the care offered, and to improve it.

On the other hand, many resource-constrained communities are very rich in terms of volunteers that put those programs together and worked hard to make them feasible with the already scarce economic resources. In this scenario the municipality used to \u00a0do some screening and allocate resource. I think this new environment leaves us with two central questions\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Now that local administrations are not longer able to do the latter, what should be their role?\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>How can communities keep their cultural programs alive?</li>\n\n</ol>I think a key element in any solution requires a change in perspective: communities should capitalize on the human and social resources they have, with the help of the administration. Institutions that can no longer offer financial support should consider what other resources or skills they can put on the plate and refrain from giving up the role of offering guidance and setting objectives and priority. From my personal experience as a volunteer this often doesn't happen, even when considering the services I was mentioning in the beginning, with actors wasting their efforts due to \"overlapping\" and many possible synergies overlooked. Meaningful things can often be done with limited resources when all actors are working toward the same goal and sharing their skills or other non monetary resources.\u00a0\n\nI think that the scarcity of resources could at least lead to more cooperation even in communities, like mine, where actors were very unwilling in the past. In any case, I think that protecting cultural programs from extinction is up to us: in a climate in which it's politically very hard to justify any expense in this domain, citizens need to take an active role, both volunteering and voicing their support for such programs.\u00a0\n\nI would love to know how public institutions and non-profit actors interact in other european countries. Are your communities facing similar challenges?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-10 15:13:38", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 09:47:53.392192", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 404, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22804, "user_id": 398, "topic_id": 1753, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>ok...</b>\n\nI see your point, and its a good one, and still, if we are planning for a pretty massive expansion in activity then I would choose the general modus and count on the programmers coming in to build this with us in light of resources being allocated, resources that are both treaditional monetary and also resources that can be self created within the system by users using the platform to develop and plug in tools for sharing and exchanging according to alternate methods developed by collaborational groups.\u00a0\n\nFor instance, I have friends in the music world making the most amazing music in the world (to these ears) and then friends making amazing films and each are trading with the other, scores for video work and vice versa, building an app to facilitate this is easy-ish and god knows there are programmers in every nook and cranny in Europe at this stage between all the hacker labs around. Lots of people are learning to work the windows 8 app development roll out, there were free classes being given all over the place and oh so many hackathons and code-a-thons going on. I am a bit of a futurist if I need a fitting category, and right now it looks like this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI base this on the understanding of the speed at which we use and ditch and reinvent new software. It generally has only a little longer shelf life than the hardware on which it operates when it comes to programs that haven't got dedicated teams maintaining and developing features. If this scenario holds, then we shot ourselves in the foot by building the set , purpose specific model, it does what it does for a short time and then\u00a0 either we are forced to create new software of the whole thing grinds to a halt in failure in technology being imitated by failure of the real life correlative. On the other hand if you build it open-plan, so basic that its easy to add to and so open that anyone can do so, then things get interesting.\n\nAgain its the 'light touch' approach. Now I realise this is not what you had chosen, but its only fair to elaborate on the importance of this issue, because it sets a serious and ultimately unavoidable limitation to go for the purpose focal version of the Edgeryders 2.0 platform. In fact I'm sick to the back teeth of 2.0s we are already way past that and at this stage 2.0, as in social media, is already crying out for a next level, so realistically we have a choice. People are sick of facebook, they are sick of the privatisation and sale of their information and generally it is becoming more and more obvious that something is either already happening, or needs to happen to fill the gap. People are kind of sick of cute cats and inspirational quotes and diversion. So many hours go into fb engagement and to no end. If a sufficiently developed system could take its place, be legally and structurally sound and operated in such a way as to empower people to\u00a0 actively with the world collectively, then we are onto something.\n\nThe reason that the CoE wants to hear from publics instead of from individuals is that individuals are dangerous, mainly because power is corruptive of those foolish enough to believe themselves the wielder as opposed to the wielded. There simply is no taming to be done, when collective activity ensues it unleashes a collective voice that tends to voice the side of social justice, which it aggregates. Look at Anonymous, a bunch of the most idiotic and bored geeks on something as random as 4-chan ended up as a movement that is capable of taking on the Israeli government as it is it engages in war with Palestine. This is serious and it is happening. Now we have a choice...\n\nDo we try to stick a finite cork in an infinitely large bottle and hope the message never gets out, do we say 'fuck it' and sit back and see what happens, or do we actively engage in the naturalisation of globally conscious self-organization? The turning gyre of time halts for no human being, not even for the corporate or political being formed of consens, and so if we are to make the right choice we need to act morally, responsibly, and in tune with not our own ideas, but with that collective we purport to support.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-11-15 21:34:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:06.769423", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 782, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77737, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13700, "post_number": 21, "raw": "OK Talked to @Jan and he says 2, so let's set it in the calendar!

Even less formal means of value exchange exist - based on sharing and giving. This is UNACCOUNTED barter. Ouch! This is where economists really have a breakdown. People can't just GIVE things - it's irrational. And that doesn't fit in with established theories.\n\nUnaccounted barter (the gift economy) is based on relationships - not transactions. It's almost completely friction free - requiring no visible accounting mechanisms whatever. However, does that mean that it's highly vulnerable to gaming? In general, no - there are solid, informal and multi-channel mechanisms by which communities build up mutual trust and unlock the advantages of the gift economy. People who exploit the (lack of) system acquire poor reputation, which is hard to shake off without making visible and genuine contributions.\n\nIn Access Space we encourage the gift economy - and it has huge practical and psychological benefits. It acts as a kind of social insurance and builds networks of friendship and mutual support.\n\nWe find that some people (particularly people with mental health difficulties) can be tempted to \"transactionalise\" relationships to their own detriment. \"Yes, I'll make you a cup of tea if you help me to format this document\". WRONG! Be nice. Make the tea. Someone may, or may not help you. You have a good time, and you build relationships. People help you for the sake of helping you - not for payment. Your need to account for exchanges suggests lack of trust.\n\nThe trouble with the unaccounted, informal barter of the gift economy is that it's most vulnerable to gaming by strangers, and by people with whom you're unlikely to have ongoing contact with. The tax free, accounting free, capitalism free, gamining resistant, high speed, low friction gift econnomy does not easily scale.\n\nIs barter a step towards the advantages of the gift economy? At this stage, I can only say \"maybe\". It could be a brilliant hack - but it might also be that facilitation of barter, such that it transactionalises gifting, actually works to erode relationships and communities.\n\nJames\n\nP.S.

(on the pic below this edition of FormStorm happens closer to the point B)</li>\n\n<li>Different levels of prepared-to-send-in is a challenge for the following reason: if we want to be realistic about the success of the application, most robust and fleshed out projects should get most attention and peer-review. However, ones at the creative stage might appear more exciting, because this stage is more fun than a brushing up stage. We have to bear this in mind.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo, my suggestion is, that FormStormers should be prepared, and even more so, given different levels of priority. Equality is for kids and kittens.\u00a0\n\n<strong>COPY STANDARD WORKSHOP PREPARATION / HOMEWORK</strong>\n\nThis means that the FormStrom 3hour Online Edition should have a prep stage. We don't have to invent the wheel here, because we can copy a standard preparation to a workshop at the academic conference.\u00a0\n\nEach FormStormer does 1.Short personal presentation with the focus on relevant fields of knowledge/expertise/experience. 2.Short description of the project. 3. Relevant links. 4.Short list of main needs/problems/questions. Highlighted keywords is great - speeds up the process.\n\nFormStormers quickly look through each other's homework.\n\nThat's usually a standard procedure before any workshop they do during conferences, for the purpose of not getting stuck in the Chaos of Creativity Stage.\n\nI agree that FormStormers of all levels of preparedness will benefit from participating and should do so, but categorization and priority might be useful from the practical point of view.\n\nThis all might sound a bit strict, but I think it is never to late to add some chaos, I'm quite good at it. So we should not worry about making a structure too rigid: it's only for 3 hours and there is no risk of loosing any of the valuable chaos.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-23 05:50:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:11.874345", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 368, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74015, "user_id": 6406, "topic_id": 13023, "post_number": 27, "raw": "[quote=\"alberto, post:26, topic:13023\"]\n* Female in her 50s, born and raised in Belgium.

The second wave of price spikes, in 2010, was even more impactful (it was one of the reasons behind the end of \u2018bread democracies\u2019 in the MENA region) and he had the chance to write, with others, a book edited by Paolo De Castro, MEP. The work had some little fortune in Italy and was accepted from an important niche [British publisher](https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Land-Scarcity-Earthscan-Agriculture-ebook-dp-B00ABM3FGS/dp/B00ABM3FGS/ref=mt_other). They were writing about sustainable development, but did not call it as such\u2026 Since 2016 Angelo has been covering also the EU news on climate, energy and environment. He is the \u201cGreen Deal journalist\u201d for ANSA, the main Italian news agency.\n\n**As a journalist, which aspects of food do you follow most closely or write about?**\n\nI try to apply a comprehensive grasp, from food production to food safety. Then, it depends on the news. I wrote about \u2018food scandals\u2019, plant and animal health (pests and diseases), nutrition labeling, organic, intellectual property regimes such as the PDO/PGI in Europe, Common Agricultural Policy, chemicals and so on. I like to do that for various kinds of media outlets, such as specialized magazines as well as mainstream media, and more research and academic-oriented circles. For instance, currently, I am contributing to the dissemination of the results of an EU Horizon2020 funded project on plant health (XF-Actors, on Xylella fastidiosa)\n\n**Which are the most significant effects of the corona virus crisis on the way governments or consumers think about food?**\n\nWe are seeing the acceleration of some trends:\na) **Localisation for consumers, gastro-nationalism for governments.** This also means an attempt to reduce dependency (see point b), even if that cannot be fully achieved and the shift in diets on a global scale is somehow unstoppable. The rice surface in Japan and South Korea is shrinking because of the shift in diets. Meat consumption is decreasing in the EU, but rising in Asia.\nb) **National food self-sufficiency being pretty impossible, governments might pursue a \u2018strategic autonomy\u2019, producing more food and stocking more food at the regional level** (EU, Mercosur, ASEAN trade blocs). China was the biggest stocker of commodities in the world. Before the pandemic it had started to empty the silos. After the pandemic, it started stockpiling again. This, however, has not stopped China to increase food imports.\nc) **Big unknowns about the AI and digitization impact on the contractual power in the food system.** We might see the reinforcement of the power of the final part of the chain \u2013 that will be Amazon \u2013 to the expenses of farmers and producers. For sure, digitization of the supply chain will mean new challenges in terms of standards in a very fragmented sector. And the consumer? He wants to be comfortable and safe. Unfortunately, this is achieved more easily through a standardized system with few actors.\n\n**What makes you personally feel unsafe when it comes to the food landscape? What worries you the most?**\n\nI do not like the current state of the debate on food and agriculture. Too much marketing, too less science. Too many religious wars. It\u2019s like we have monocultures in the head. The risk that worries me the most is widening the distance between urban and rural areas. I mean, all the sustainability debate is monopolized by urban dwellers. Yellowjackets' movement in France was not a matter of history (like the XX century revolutions liked to see themselves), but of geography instead. Maybe, it is just that I am exposed to Brussels bubble too much\u2026\n\n**I\u2019m curious how you personally consume food: for you and your family.. Where do you buy it? Are there initiatives that you support?**\n\nI am the cook at home, so I am the one in charge of buying food. And I buy food everywhere. I have the chance to live in an area with different options: supermarkets, borough markets, specialized shops (organic)\u2026 More rarely, also online orders and home delivery. I bought from a groupe d'achat for a while, then I supported the short-supply chain experience of Epelia in Germany. Now, I admit, I lost contact with it.\n\n**Agriculture in Eastern Europe**\n\nEastern Europe is extremely interesting because there you have young farmers. They are more prone to innovation, to change mindsets, to do things..\n\nIn EU, you have less than 10% farmers under 35 years. Most of them do agriculture in a more traditional way, where you are obliged to cope with nature and natural phenomena - floods, pests etc. Agriculture is slow, it cannot be fast, unless you grow vegetables in a greenhouse.\n\nBe careful: you cannot grow soy or beans, or wheat (the core of nutrition) in a greenhouse. The idea that greenhouses could feed the whole world is a myth.\n\nWhen the Berlin Wall fell down, the transformation of agricultural structure in some Eastern countries has been to transform the big state cooperatives in big enterprises: in the Cz Rep, Slovakia, Hungary. They have huge farms that they inherited in a sense. But in Poland and Romania, the reaction was the opposite: when I was in Cluj 10 years ago, I talked to a professor saying: we have these new coops, but with the agrarian reform every Romanian wants their own plot of land, but this is not feasible because they were too fragmented. The mindset in these countries is that you have the big companies, but also the small ones, that want to do something on their own - ex. If they have their sheep, they found a way to sell their milk and other products to local supermarkets. There is this feeling of nostalgia.\n\nBut when young farmers come in, they can transform nostalgia into something good.\n\n**What kind of structures are needed to support innovation in agriculture?**\n\nTraditionally, innovation happened through researchers studying in the lab and then going to the field to show farmers what can be changed.\n\nAfter the Green Revolution, this has collapsed in the West, where food is no longer an issue of security, but where we think about new things. Corporate funding has replaced public funding, which is not entirely great - when you have public funding, you can do long term things, and bear the weight of asking questions for the environmental and social wellbeing. In corporate world, they want the return of investment, it\u2019s not their job to think in social terms.\n\nThe EU has tried to finance and to support bottom up operational groups in the [European Innovation Partnership in Agriculture (EIP AGRI)](https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/european-innovation-partnership-agricultural). They are conceived as heterogeneous, with farmers, NGOs, researchers. Even with public support, the solutions they find have problems to scale up and be replicable.\n\nThe issue of public support now is not giving money, is to interconnect these projects. You have a website with hundreds, thousands of projects, but who\u2019s going to connect the dots? If the state of public power does not do that, someone else has to.\n\n### How can we work together to support localisation of food?

In retrospect, it seems obvious: after all, this space exists because a small patrol of economically inclined sci-fi authors invested a lot of time and brainpower into dreaming up [exotic economic systems](/t/econ-sf-a-selection-of-works-and-authors/8582). But we added a couple of extra ideas to that original insight. \n\nFirst, **we decided to build the world in a participatory way.** We want anyone to be free to contribute ideas, analysis, references, visuals, and so on. Would technologies of great power (like *Star Trek*'s replicators) be compatible with a market economy as we know, based on scarcity? How would slower-than-light interstellar trade work? (Nobel laureate Paul Krugman actually [worked that one out](https://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/interstellar.pdf)) How can *Harry Potter*'s Wizarding world use precious metal as a currency, given that wizards can simply magick out more of it and cause hyperinflation? No matter how smart, an individual author can not keep track of all the possible variables and their permutations. So, we are going to do that as a community. It just makes sense. There are already over 150 people posting on this forum, many of us professional economists. **We are licensing the world with an open source license**: you can use it for your novel, film or game, and no lawyer will ever come calling if you make it big.\n\n**Second, we decided we want a world that contains several economic systems, not just one**. Again, this is an old trick in sci-fi: Anarres and Urras in Ursula K. Le Guin *The Dispossessed*, the Hives in Ada Palmer's *Terra Ignota*, the Acquis and the Dispensation in Bruce Sterling's *The Caryatids*,  and so on. This plurality creates a nice narrative tension, as characters can move across places and experience different economies. Also, readers tend to start thinking which economic system they would choose, if they were free to do so. For example, [this poll](https://www.poll-maker.com/poll1009893xa10948B5-42) about \"which Terra Ignota Hive would you choose\" is popular on the Internet ([explanation of the Hives](https://www.tor.com/2017/03/13/writing-a-future-in-which-you-choose-your-own-nation/)).\n\nBut participatory projects work best if someone makes an initial investment in them. Participating in filling an empty space can be intimidating, or simply not that much fun. So, **third, we decided to [offer a writers' residency](https://edgeryders.eu/t/writers-residency-come-lead-the-worldbuilding-academy/14502) to someone to lead the charge**. The residency is generously funded by Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 Messina, the people with [one of the weirdest, most fascinating real-life economic models](https://edgeryders.eu/t/an-innovative-social-investment-model-in-messina-sicily/9451) we have found so far. Among the applications who flowed in, many stood out; but in the end, the strongest one came from [Yudhanjaya Wijeratne](https://yudhanjaya.com/), a Nebula-nominated author from Sri Lanka and a member of our community (as @yudhanjaya). His novel *Numbercaste* has been on our [wiki of economic sci-fi](/t/8582) since the beginning. \n\nYudhanjaya pointed out that, in order to bring the world to a level of maturity where contributing to it is fun and interesting, **a small team is better than one person. So, fourth, we decided to create one**. The other team members are [Joriam Ramos](https://joriamramoscv.webflow.io/) (here as @Joriam), a Brazilian author and designer affiliated to [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com/); [Michela De Domenico](https://unime.academia.edu/MichelaDomenico) and [Marco Lo Curzio](http://www.accademiadicatania.com/docenti/MarcoLoCurzio), Italian architects and illustrators; and [yours truly](https://www.cottica.net), as the resident economist. If you want to volunteer for the core group, just let me know with a comment or a DM.\n\nThis group has the task to prepare, and pre-populate an online space where we all can contribute to build an open source. We are preparing a webinar which will be held Monday, 7 December at 17.00 CET, to present our concept and initial thoughts, and seek feedback from the community. \n\nThe call will be recorded for research purposes.

So they're going to put in wireless links, and then get community centers, they're typically underutilized, they might have meeting rooms, places like that people could work from, and encourage people to use them internally and externally.\u201d\n\n## Other examples of similar initiatives governments have run were mentioned, including libraries.\n\n\u201cIt was an Eastern European country (possibly Bulgaria)\u2026 but basically it was a public-private partnership where the government came in and...  basically the rural community had to provide a building, and they came in with funding, and support, to turn that into a workplace in that area.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe've also been working with the Scottish Libraries Information Council. They've been creating a blueprint with a load of our information, on how to create a coworking hub within a library context.\n\n\u201cWe would have all of our libraries, virtually all the libraries in Ireland, would have WiFi access. They would facilitate people typically to go in and study and hotdesk on them. Actually renting out a room, or a desk on a permanent basis. Probably, the vast majority of our libraries wouldn't be big enough to facilitate that.\"\n\n\u201cOne of the things that struck me as interesting here, is that they've been trying to (get) people using libraries. A lot of neighborhoods in the US don't have internet at home, or can't afford it. A library is where you get the internet, and that's where people do job hunting and stuff like that, but they do not have spaces for people to close the door and do a video call. You can't do an audio call in an open plan library, that's not how libraries work. So some of the libraries are trying to remodel. You can actually book a room for an hour or two. But it's really new, and it's very experimental.\u201d\n\n\u201cA few places in the US specifically moved their routers out towards the walls of the building, and marked out and told everyone which parking spaces nearby you could park your car in and get access to the internet from there, even though you were not in the physical building. I thought that was a really clever.\u201d\n\n## Then someone pointed out there is a big difference between a place that provides access to the internet and a coworking space\n\n\u201cI just want to add that - we all know this - coworking is not a provision of the internet in a room, coworking is what you facilitate within a room and four walls, and through other platforms.2\n\n\u201cI don't want to damage the coworking brands by having it dumbed down. Ones got to be very careful\u2026 It's just that whole \u2018is coworking the same as flexi workspace?\u2019I don't think so. \u2018Is coworking a room in a community center where you can get the internet?\u2019 No, I don't think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just encourage us to really ensure that coworking is the engine that drives our entrepreneurial community forward. Not just a service that is dumbed down.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople recognise the word flexispace or shared workspace, but if you do coworking in your space, a group of people will understand that as a way of doing it.\"\n\n You have a gym, and there's an easy gym, or there's\u2026 But then if there's a CrossFit gym, there's like a cult, in a positive way, that's what happens there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's that thing of a restaurant. There's lots of different types of restaurants. And does Domino's pizza consider itself a restaurant? I don't know. Does coworking\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you design a beautiful car, and even if you put a nice engine in it, but you don't turn the key, and you don't know where you're going, you don't know what the route map is.\n\n\u201cWhat's the point of a coworking hub? If it isn't to stimulate, and support our economy, and the people who create our economy and drive it forwards. So the internet is just one of many tools, where are we taking that community? And how are we driving it, supporting it? How do we service it? Facilitate it? Make sure the oil runs through the engine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt depends, because we offer both. Our ethos is obviously community driven. I wouldn't say that we would really host many corporate companies in any of our sites across London. Our coworking site is definitely more collaborative, and design driven, creative driven. So I wouldn't really say we would host anybody in the corporate world. We try to keep our ethos going throughout any private office regardless of what they do.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut a lot of people, a lot of leads will come through, and they know that this place just isn't for them, because it's not a fancy building. Like Claire was saying a fancy building, with fancy wallpaper, and furniture, and offer distilled water from a glass tap. That's not what we're about. So yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI run a creative hub in the village of Java, in Indonesia... we only have one building for the library and like an open room for traditional dance class, like a multifunction room. And the rest is just a garden. So we do most of the activities under the trees.\u201d\n \n\u201cSo yeah, sometimes we have discussion workshops, or events. So, once in a month we run a garden market.

I'm sorry to hear about your cousin and share in your experience that these fleeting witnessing of the social media profiles of the dead are a jarring juxtaposition that solicits the grieving process all over again. Yet, many of the young people I interviewed expressed that this presence brought them comfort and helped in their recovery, because the memory of their loved one is permanently embedded into their social media networks and uses, and the digital footprints they share can be achived and memoralized on the\u00a0<em>digital</em>\u00a0platform of social media (they pay less attention to the\u00a0<em>public\u00a0</em>nature of some of these platforms).\n\nMemorialization of the dead for the dead who can no longer speak for themselves is indeed tricky. I think there is an implicit hierarchy of grief and proximity among the loved ones of the deceased that influencers who gets to have a say. I personally feel a little put-off when folks of super-distant, loosely aggregated, weak social ties excessively express their grief over my sister, especially when some folks start comparing the authenticity and intensity of their grief. But I remind myself that it is not in my place to police how people grief, because we all cope in ways that help us. So I end up putting aside some of these negative feelings, and reach out to those in the 'inner social circle' for mutual aftercare.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-17 04:36:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.215582", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 259, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8509], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77430, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 13409, "post_number": 17, "raw": "[quote=\"yannick, post:9, topic:13409\"]\nThe problem with the shared kitchen spaces are the many restrictions and complicated logistical problems they create.\n[/quote]\n\nWe see this with @winnieponcelet in our shared space - we cannot even insulate our own production from other (possiblty hazardous or non-compliant) productions.\n\nI think shared spaces are great for testing and product development, they don't work for selling your products, because there is too much interdependency.\n\nIt's quite unfortunate, that at some point you do have to go on your own - or invest just as much in a shared AND compliant space!

She told me the story of a childhood in a rural community in Germany amongst multiple generations of women. They had a little shop in the community but they would make use of it once a month- not once a week. The communal life was strong and active in this self-sustaining village perhaps in part due to the need to collaborate and pool resources; people meeting once a week to bake their bread together in the communal bakery and so on.\n\nThe conversation openend a window into memories I had from visits to my father\u00b4s village in the Jazeera region of the Sudan. In both the case of my friend\u00b4s village and that of my father there was a quick change over the course of one generation. In my friend\u00b4s case the car industry made it self more present and something in the dynamics changed with a shift to making a living through employment. In my Father\u00b4s village\u00b4s case many moved to the capital in pursuit of higher education and yes, employment. In both cases this shift had a debilitating effect on the community resilience. In the case of the German village the community more or less died and in the Sudanese case city life did not live up to it\u00b4s promise as the lack of employment opportunities, precarious work situation and extremely low pay casts doubt on whether they were really better off. There is Making a Living, and then there is making to live.\n\nAs I was re-reading the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaigns\"> posts on Edgeryders</a> about how those of us at the edges of change are making a living in Europe it struck me that at the core of any discussion about the activities that sustain us, it is essential to ask ourselves questions about resilience and autonomy. Why? because the old welfare model, the one we inherited from our parents is beginning to need an upgrade as we move away from the industrial society to one in which the status of the long term, full-time employee is no longer the norm.\n\nWhat things can I do on my own to provide for my basic needs, i.e. put a food on the table, a roof over my head, and my body and mind in good health in an urban environment?\n\nLet\u00b4s play with the thought of needing to do this entirely without money exchanging hands- how would we do this? In the place I live and amongst the people I know what are social resilience and protection mechanisms that I could rely on should my bank suddenly stop working tomorrow? What if all our banks were to shut down tomorrow? We are already seeing this unfold in Greece and Spain but above and beyond the recent developments we really need to look for alternatives for a growing number of people outside the job paradigm. But as I watch the interveiw of Elf Pavlik by@Cataspanglish, I realise it\u00b4s not just about subsituting one transaction with another, but exploring alternative ways of relating to each other. \u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/fCFe2KnBuJ0\u00a0\n\nI would really <strong>really</strong> like to try mapping this out with other Edgeryders between now and <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/conference/\">#LOTE</a>. A good place to begin is by mapping the alternatives currently available to me personally.

Also, personally, I find this platform difficult to get my head around, it doesn't allow for much spontaneity. A chat-based platform such as Slack or Discord + a place to summarise ideas can lend some dynamism. I'm on several such servers that span timezones all around the world, so long as the pace of conversation is moderate it can work very well. \n\n* Also, yes please to organising intentional crews to work on specific aspects of the Worldbuilding. \n\n* Wikis are hard work \u2014 I'm sure you're already aware, so there needs to be a few \"stewards\" or \"gardeners\" to keep things tidy if there are going to be multiple contributors on topics. \n\nInstead of a short story *competition* \u2014 I think there ought to be an *anthology* with a fixed number of submissions, so that we foster collaboration more than compete. This way we could riff off each others' ideas as we go forward in a friendly, creative environment. We would also hopefully end up with a collection of stories that would allow the greater public to engage with the world we're building. We can do something different here: it'd be interesting to pair a subject matter expert with a writer so that they can examine one particular aspect of the world through a story.

How are we creating opportunities for ourselves and where can we support one another better? In work, health, family, community life.\n\nIt's asking difficult questions - and we should avoid asking questions, let alone difficult one, as less people will be inclined to take action. But also, the questions make me as reader think you will give me the answer. But what we want is the people coming to our landing page to click on a button that allows them to share their story. We want them to take action. It also has maybe too many \"difficult\" words, and since we really want a wide audience, we have to be mindful of that. (words like 'community' are very much only appealing or understandable to one higher educated left leaning target group)\n\nSo, an alternative to to overarching explainer could be (rough draft, very open to input, but you'll get the idea):\n\nJob loss, no access to healthcare, chaotic or unfair elections and more. Living a good life in these uncertain times can be tough. Share how you manage to do so, whether it's in your work, your health, with your family, or friends.  \n\nNow, regarding the copy for the buttons:\n\n1. \u201cBurning Topics\u201d or \u201cHot Right Now\u201d - these lines are great for a young, active, artsy even audience, but would not be appealing to more conservative folks for example.

Do we want them to join? And then what? As user, I have no idea what's being asked from me if I'd join, and why I would want to. What's in it for me.

For the past 20 years he has been working on art that tries to reconnect communities to their local bodies of water to become more sensitized to the complex issues that affect them._\n\n\nDuring an exhibition on the history and present conditions of the Scajaquada River in Buffalo , New York, I was approached to consider doing a similar project about the Bagmati River that flows through the middle of Kathmandu, Nepal. I was excited about extending my body of work beyond the Western Hemisphere and to working with a culturally diverse community.\n\nThe project was a success and resulted in [a documentary](http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/videos/bagmati/), a book written in English and Nepali, an exhibition, [website](http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/) and a poster.\n\nThe fly fishing program is another way of reconnecting people to their local environment. It has educational and therapeutic benefits. I\u2019m working with youth to get them more engaged with their environment and to instill a sense of stewardship. I also organize a conference on this topic to help educators connect science, art and literature through fly fishing.\n\nAt the OpenVillage, I will give a lecture about the Bagmati River Project and a brief overview of the other projects that led up to it. It is an active session with visuals, sound and video. I\u2019d like to open a discussion about the topic afterwards.\n\nWe will also do a fly fishing demo with a group of children and participants of OpenVillage. We will combine this with citizen science experiments on water quality and stream biology. This format can be documented and reused by schools who would like to implement a similar project in their curriculum.\n\n\n**Alberto\u2019s lecture and demo are part of the Citizen Science track at #OpenVillage.

I think the results are actually a pretty good approximation of how I am spending my time. I looked at the stats for the last 12 months for [Babel Between Us](https://bbu.world/), [Blivande](https://forum.blivande.com/) and edgeryders.eu. Granted, the BBU platform started only 8 months ago.\n\n![09|690x520](upload://zDhq9xb4CB2uk1wjBG9sJLB1HfS.png) \n\nFirst of all, this shows that most of the work I do on edgeryders.eu is simply keeping myself in the loop about projects and core company work. I would say that this is accurate. \n\nIt's also true that while Edgeryders is fully online, Blivande is a place. I obviously take in a lot of information about it by simply being on location. I think that on a whole, my split between the two is about equal, and the difference between posts read _feels_ right to me accounting for that only 1/3 of the information about Blivande comes to me through the forum.\n\nWhen it comes to replying to threads, this seems to indicate that I am roughly equally engaged in these communities.\n\nAs for BBU, that also feels accurate. In the last year as a whole, BBU has taken up about 10% of my time, but this has been increasing. In the few 6 months, it's probably rather close to 20%.\n\n![12|690x514](upload://82niBE7gp8eERcCvSNSNnDY8hM6.png) \n\nFrom this, I notice that I create about twice as many topics on Blivande than on Edgeryders. I also create relatively many topics on BBU compared to the time I spend on it. This is natural, as I lead more projects at Blivande (which is also where the Plato work happens) and BBU. On Edgeryders.eu, I don't lead any active projects since Participio spun off into BBU and Plato, although I have a position of leadership through being a director. \n\nI think that I'm a bit of a guinea pig when it comes to working for Edgeryders across multiple platforms, so I thought I'd share this insight as we might start seeing this pattern proliferate to more of us over time.", "created_at": "2020-05-08 14:33:08.704125", "updated_at": "2020-05-08 18:11:42.158595", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 373, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 87.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 2915, 3, 4, 5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79907, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 13975, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-07-03 18:16:42.920848", "updated_at": "2020-07-03 18:16:42.920848", "deleted_at": "2020-07-03 18:27:56.018834", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76839, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 13572, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Graphryder is the technology that we rely on to be able to do \"Semantic Social Network Analysis\".

An annotation is an instance of using a code and refers to a specific location in a specific post of a specific topic.\n * We use a Python service called [Graphryder API](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-api) to build a graph of all users, topics, posts, codes, and annotations in Neo4j, and to then use that graph database to draw interpretations of that graph with a graph algorithm library called Tulip.\n * Tulip data from Graphryder API is accessed and displayed through [Graphryder Dashboard](http://graphryder2.edgeryders.eu/#!/dashboard/globalView), a client-side Javascript application. Graphryder API also reads data from the Neo4j database directly.\n\n## What we want\n\n### SSNA we can depend on\n\nOur current stack is getting old, and we keep patching it, but some of the technology might break. We already have problems with new versions of Neo4j, and the old versions have other problems and are already end of life. Additionally, there are libraries and components in the old stack that are no longer maintained. We need to be able to rely on our SSNA stack.\n\n### Adding SSNA to a project should not incur extra IT costs\n\nCurrently, the installation of Graphryder can only handle looking at a single dataset. We currently use the methodology for four projects and need to have four instances of Graphryder API, four Neo4j databases, and four different deployments of Graphryder Dashboard. This is not sustainable, and to be able to offer SSNA projects at a reasonable price we need to be able to add projects without having to go through deployment.\n\nOur goal should be that adding standard SSNA to a project should come at zero development cost apart from carrying its share of paying to the IT overhead fund, which should cover bug fixing and improvement across projects. Within a project, our research budget should be used for research.\n\n### Real-time updates \n\nCurrently, each Graphryder API instance needs to reload data manually from Discourse in a heavy operation, emptying and rebuilding the Neo4j database every time you want to load new data. We would like to have a graph view of what is happening in our Discourse. Which users are interacting a lot and are there clusters of people who interact with each other? Which ethnographic codes are coming up across projects? \n\nAn up-to-date graph can also help community managers and provide reflective feedback to users.\n\n### Quickly deploy new experimental views\n\nWe want to make it easier for the Edgeryders Research Network to experiment with new ways to visualize and analyze the SSNA and social data from the Edgeryders Discourse.\n\n### Graphs everywhere\n\nWe want to have components that allow us to embed graphs from our projects on our public-facing websites, showing interesting views of our research using up to date community data.\n\n## Challenges with the current setup\n\n### Neo4j is crippleware\n\nIn January I had a look at making Graphryder API multi-tenant, and [came to the conclusion](https://edgeryders.eu/t/making-graphryder-api-multi-tenant/12309?u=hugi) that Neo4j is the real culprit.\n\nNeo4j is a powerful graph database, but the open-source Community Edition is only barely usable in production. Specifically, you need their enterprise edition to enable having more than one graph per install and to enable more than one user with different permissions. \n\nHaving something that we could simply tack on to any Discourse deployment as a plugin would be a lot easier.\n\n### Graphryder API is a messy codebase\n\nGraphryder API has a lot of dead ends and is a bit hard to understand. This is because it was originally supposed to do more than it does, but was left unfinished. Now that we know what we need it to do, it needs to be restructured.\n\n### Graphryder Dashboard is approaching end-of-life\n\nGraphryders Dashboard is an Angular app that uses Grunt and Bower. It's an old technology that is hard to maintain and difficult to work with. It's also an oddity in our front end ecosystem, where we usually use Vue.js or React.\n\nEventually, we want to rebuild the dashboard, probably in Vue.js. \n\n## Step by step plan\n\n### Phase 1: Replace Neo4j with RedisGraph\n\nBoth Neo4j and RedisGraph use Cypher. Theoretically, if a  RedisGraph stores the data from Discourse and the annotation data in the same structure as Neo4j, Graphryder API should be able to read from that instead of first having to build the data in Neo4j.\n\nGraphryder API has two major parts: \n\n* [importFromDiscourse](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-api/blob/master/importer/importFromDiscourse.py), which loads the data from Discourse into Neo4j. It does not load all posts, but instead only topics with a [tag set in the config](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-api/blob/master/config.example.ini).\n* [graphtulip](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-api/tree/master/graphtulip), a library of python classes that read the Neo4j graph and prepare Tulip graphs based on that data.\n\nIn Phase 1, we would:\n\n* Replace importFromDiscourse with a Discourse plugin that builds an up-to-date database based on the Discourse data, the codes, and annotations, and exposes a protected endpoint for Cypher queries of that data.\n\n* Implement a connector to RedisGraph instead of Neo4j in Graphryder API.\n\n* Check the Cypher queries of graphtulip functions as needed to now only call the subgraph related to a certain Discourse topic-tag.\n\n* Patch up the Cypher queries as needed in case the Cypher implementations of Neo4j and RedisGraph are not 1 to 1. \n\nAt the end of Phase 1, we should still have a functioning Graphryder API that works with Graphryder Dashboard, but the importFromDiscourse module can now be scrapped. We now have all the raw SSNA data available through an endpoint that accepts Cypher queries.\n\n### Phase 2: Make Graphryder API multi-tenant\n\nAt the end of Phase 1, Graphryder API is still single-tenant. Graphtulip prepares \"tlp\" data files that are downloaded by the Graphryder Dashboard. Currently, it has no way of keeping track of multiple subgraphs, and each \"tag-focus\" subgraph needs to be processed independently for display.\n\nIn phase 2, the Graphryder API is refactored to be able to handle keeping track of an arbitrary number of subgraphs and their corresponding tlp files, and serve up the right files to the Graphryder Dashboard when passed the right tag.\n\n### Phase 3: Rebuild a multi-tenant Graphryder Dashboard with Vue.js\n\nGraphryder Dashboard has served us well, but its core technologies are aging to the point of being very hard to maintain. We would like to rebuild the dashboard in Vue, which would also allow us to abstract the components and display Graphryder SSNA graphs on our other websites.\n\nFurthermore, one deployment of Dashboard per API should be enough, and the tag focus should be possible to set client-side. \n\n## Doing the work\n\nI have previously talked to @gdpelican about this, and he has been experimenting with RedisGraph. \n\nTo get us started, I would like to offer him to work on Phase 1. We could pull the budget from a few different places and share it between units, but it's hard to estimate exactly how much we need without letting him get to work on scoping out the project. \n\n**What I can offer directly is work for up to 10 hours on scoping out the time needed to complete phase 1.** This only means coming back with a plan and time estimate. I can also guarantee that we have the budget for up to at least 80 hours from projects I run, and I will talk to @matthias and @alberto to see if we can pool resources to get Phase 2 and 3 done.   \n\nAre you still interested in working on this @gdpelican?", "created_at": "2020-05-18 19:05:00.804747", "updated_at": "2020-05-18 20:52:42.185043", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1344, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 37.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47911, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 8921, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Just jumping in here to say hello :hand_splayed:.

It was indeed frustrating knowing you could complete a project on time, only to have your boss need to stop you and question what you were doing and suggest changes. But I got the idea that maybe if I talked with the boss and showed him that we could get more done as a department if we all worked together to have better communications and to trust each other to ask for help and direction when we needed it. Since we worked together, rather than against each other, the boss gained confidence in us to do our jobs, and we were able to do our jobs and also regain the reputation of the department.\nMOHAMED ABD ELTAWWAB AHMED MOHAMED", "created_at": "2017-08-26 07:50:14.670769", "updated_at": "2017-09-05 11:32:16.464365", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 343, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 29.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3729], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64068, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 11523, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2019-11-14 13:28:51.739339", "updated_at": "2019-11-14 13:28:51.739339", "deleted_at": "2019-11-14 17:06:58.529714", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70520, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 128, "raw": "Yes, they filmed shortly there and now it's crazy, \"museums\" and gift shops all over the place.

In light of that, pulling this bit out and opting for a single endpoint which accepts a string to run as a Cypher query should be the initial push.\n\n- Sync the Discourse DB so that it writes to RedisGraph as well (~8hrs)\n    - Reference the existing ImportFromDiscourse module to determine which Discourse events this needs to occur on to maintain an up-to-date graph in Redis\n        - Create / update topic / post\n        - Create / update tag\n        - Others? Annotations?\n\n- Write an endpoint to accept Cypher queries to RedisGraph (~4hrs)\n    - Ensure this is read-only for the graph; no modification of nodes should be possible\n    - Need to think about a security approach for this endpoint; api key provided by the client?\n\n- Adapt Graphyryder API to call Redisgraph endpoint instead of neo4j (~15-20hrs)\n    - Need to get graphryder running locally\n    - Should include documentation changes on how the new API functions\n    - This phase is the highest risk one at the moment; although replacing the queries should be fairly straightforward, I haven't been able to get Graphryder running locally just yet, meaning it may be difficult to verify the fixes are working properly and that end-to-end the graphs are unchanged. Hopefully removing the neo4j dependency will help with this part.\n\nThis is a short week in New Zealand ([happy birthday to the Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Official_Birthday)), so I'll look to get the first three Discourse items together starting next week, then start on the Graphryder API piece the week after.

In the US, our insurance system is provided by a few companies that sell packages, which penalize people who are unemployed or in freelance/ non-traditional modes or employment. Universal healthcare is quite a political spectacle, and not many people are holding their breath up for something to pass soon. \n\nDo people know examples of where health insurance is based on small scale local pooling of monetary resources, which then is accepted by sympathetic health care professionals?

I don't know whether their impact is large enough or whether they could better use the large amounts of money they suck up.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the organizational culture, the inside politics, the people and their posing, similarly to your accounts.

I noticed that no matter where one is working - profit, nonprofit, activism, Middle East or North America, healthcare, social change - some of the underlying issues and causes of burnout are the same. \n\nI wrote a [book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Idealists-Survival-Kit-Prevent-Burnout/dp/1941529348) on ways to prevent and deal with it which has been well-received, though I sense that people still feel the stigma and shame around burning out as if it was a personal failure. People don't like to talk about it, yet, wherever I go I find that burnout is a huge problem. We are overwhelmed and obsessed with the idea of wellbeing and self-care, bur we rarely ask why. Burnout is the outcome of a broken way of working, if it weren't for the burnt out lifestyle we are immersed in, we wouldn't need all the costly \"wellness\" training, retreats and workshops that the selfcare industry wants to sell us.\n\nI'm interested in raising awareness around burnout and why it's not just a personal problem. I think workshops are dead, and so I'm envisaging a new way of having meaningful conversations, especially with those who come in with ideals and don't want to end up jaded and burnt out.\n\nI read about the idea of the trauma tour @ybe and I wonder if a similar model could be adapted for burnout. I'm open to ideas, and interested in testing them.

The reliable real-time identification of more than a billion people by their faces alone is not possible yet, but the Chinese system doesn\u2019t depend on faces alone. Erik Learned-Miller, of UMass, told me, \u201cLet\u2019s assume you\u2019re a Chinese citizen and your home address is registered with the government. So when they see a person in Xi\u2019an who looks like you, and they know you live in Xi\u2019an, they\u2019ll probably guess it\u2019s you. And if they\u2019re also tracking your cell phone and they know that twenty minutes ago you were in a restaurant nearby\u2014now it\u2019s almost certainly you.\u201d Cell-phone signals and digital financial transactions, which in China are highly centralized, are the human-surveillance equivalent of bovine ear tags: they\u2019re supplemental identifiers that increase the reliability of facial matches. \u201cThe Chinese are integrating massively,\u201d Learned-Miller continued. \u201cThey can say, \u2018Hey, we recognized this guy in a Starbucks this morning, and now he\u2019s in a McDonald\u2019s\u2014he is getting too American, let\u2019s bring him in.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBy the time China\u2019s surveillance system is fully implemented, it will include mandatory \u201csocial credit\u201d ratings, which score individuals\u2019 general worthiness based on factors such as what they buy (too much alcohol?), what they do with their free time (too many video games?), and whom they hang out with online (too many low-rated social parasites?). A voluntary version of the rating system is already in place. People with high scores are given opportunities that others don\u2019t receive, including access to jobs, loans, and travel. And virtual ear tags are proliferating. The N.Y.P.D. reads and records the license plates of many vehicles that enter and leave the city. Google knows everywhere I\u2019ve been with my phone. China has begun employing its own gait-recognition technology, which its developer has said can\u2019t be fooled by \u201climping, walking with splayed feet, or hunching over.\n\nAmericans may believe that we would never tolerate the installation of millions of surveillance cameras, but the Hunts told me that we wouldn\u2019t necessarily know it was happening. Ross Hunt said, \u201cI want autonomous driving to be a thing, but if you have autonomous-car ubiquity you have the Internet of Eyes everywhere, because on an autonomous car there are cameras all the way around.\u201d Self-driving vehicles use their cameras to identify and avoid obstacles, but any camera that sees its surroundings also sees every person it passes. Many electric vehicles record location and driving data continuously and periodically upload that information to their manufacturers; China now requires all such vehicles operating in the country to transmit the same information to government monitors. Ross went on, \u201cThat\u2019s today. So, if they already have your telemetry, how long will it be until they also have the imagery? It\u2019s just a bandwidth issue.\u201d", "created_at": "2019-02-06 16:51:47.897269", "updated_at": "2019-02-06 16:51:47.897269", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 558, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 2.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [50639], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55180, "user_id": 4892, "topic_id": 10106, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Klappt nicht, gern als PDF schicken, danke !!!

Annette\u2019s current work explores the ethics and politics of algorithmic decision-making, machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nHere is a shortened version of our fascinating conversation (AZ: Annette Zimmermann, LS: Leonie Schulte)\n\n\n\n**LS:** **What are you working on right now? What are some of your future projects that you are excited about?**\n\n**AZ:** Right now, I am working on several academic papers on the concept of algorithmic injustice. I am interested in the scope of that concept: I think that it\u2019s important to understand what kind of problem we are dealing with and how big of a problem it is, in comparison to other moral and political problems, because our answer to that question will determine what kind of answers we can give about morally and politically justifiable *solutions*. In my work, I think about questions like: what type of injustice are we talking about when we talk about algorithmic injustice? Is it a unique form of injustice, or just a reiteration of other, more familiar forms of non-technological injustice that already shape society? I am also interested in the question of how algorithmic bias develops and compounds over time, which in my view is an extremely underexplored area. \n\nI am also working on a short book titled *The* *Algorithmic is Political*. The book is about the extent to which technological design and deployment decisions have this political and moral baggage that we talked about before, and what that means for our moral and political rights and duties: who is responsible for when things go wrong? Who should fix things like algorithmic bias, particularly when it compounds historical patterns of injustice? Are there some decisions that we simply should not automate, even if we have highly accurate and efficient technological tools? Who has a right to have a say: who should be involved in decisions about that, and how should those decisions take place given existing political and social structures? What would it mean to democratize AI, and would democratizing AI solve problems like algorithmic injustice?\n\n**LS:** **At EgdeRyders, we like to learn about what motivates experts to work in their respective fields: Can you tell me a little bit about what brought you into this line of research?**\n\n**AZ:** I have always been interested in topics related to democracy, justice, and the moral and political significance of risk and uncertainty. Before starting my current research project on the ethics and politics of artificial intelligence and machine learning, I was thinking about decision-making and justice more broadly: about the rights that people have when democratic constituencies make decisions together, particularly when different people bear various levels of risk of being affected by those decisions. Then I realised that *algorithmic* decision-making models often lead to a specific instantiation of this complex, larger problem that appears over and over again in political philosophy: in a democratic society, in which we are committed to treating people as equals, how should we distribute risks between people?\n\n**LS:** **Why do we need to think about the *ethics* of artificial intelligence and algorithmic decision-making? In concrete terms, what does ethical reasoning about emerging technologies involve?**\n\n**AZ:** Right now, a lot of people\u2014including those working in the tech industry\u2014are recognizing the need for ethical reflection on the social implications of AI: we are in an \u2018AI ethics gold rush\u2019 moment. But how does one actually *do* AI Ethics? I think that when people hear \u2018ethics\u2019, they often think of it as basically being the same thing as reasoning based on personal beliefs and opinions, religious views, or cultural norms. Many people therefore think that the answers to all ethical questions\u2014that is, questions about what we  *ought to*  do, about what it means to do the *right thing* \u2014are ultimately relative: that there is no obvious way of sorting out whether one ethical view is better or worse than another view. I think that that is a dangerous way of thinking about ethics\u2014including AI ethics\u2014because I think that there are at least some value-based arguments that are clearly incoherent or that lead to deeply morally repugnant conclusions. We don\u2019t have to treat all ethical arguments as equally persuasive by default. Of course, there will still be many competing ethical arguments that are not obviously flawed in that way, so complicated trade-offs may arise. For instance, in the context of AI, we might really care about accuracy, but we also really care about justice, and about efficiency, and about transparency, privacy, and so on. All of these are important values and goals\u2014but it is not enough to simply come up with a \u2018wish list\u2019 of values, because it is often impossible to optimize for all of these important values at the same time. We have to make ethical judgment calls about which values to rank more highly, and we have to be clear about which values we have *failed* to realise when we do so. Doing ethics well means getting comfortable with that sense of uncertainty surrounding these trade-offs: there is a risk that we might get things wrong, and a good way of confronting that risk is to keep asking questions, rather than committing to one ethical argument at one point in time (a view like: \u201cIrrespective of the domain of application, always prioritize accuracy over transparency!\u201d) and then trying to just apply it without ever revisiting it. In other words, it\u2019s dangerous to declare the ethical case closed. Whenever we do ethics\u2014and that \u2018we\u2019 includes not just political and moral philosophers, but also tech practitioners, policy-makers, and ordinary citizens\u2014we must remain open to the possibility that we have been making the wrong choices so far, and that we need to change our actions going forward, rather than simply trying to make whatever we have been doing so far more efficient. I think that one central dimension of this in the context of AI ethics will be to prioritise the perspective of those most directly and most negatively affected by the use of algorithmic decision-making tools that exhibit racial or gender bias, as well as other forms of biases that exacerbate social inequality.\n\n**LS:** **In popular culture and in public discourse, AI is often portrayed as a kind of looming entity, which is both inevitable and out of our control. People seem to worry about the ways in which we ought to *adapt* to the emergence of powerful new technologies: how will AI change what it means to be human? But it also seems important to turn that question on its head: how should humans shape what AI does and does not do? Which consequences of AI innovation are truly inevitable and where do human decision-makers have room to make deliberate, conscious choices about how AI affects our social life? How does your work respond to these complex questions?**\n\n\n**AZ:** I think that public discourse on this issue tends to split into two fairly extreme views, neither one of which is correct. On the one hand, there\u2019s \u2018AI optimism: the view that the increasingly ubiquitous use of AI is inevitable, that we can\u2019t return to not using AI once we have deployed it in a given domain. The implicit assumption behind that view often seems to be something like, \"well, if AI is inevitable, there isn't really a point in trying to critique it ethically\"\u2014or to critique it politically, even. On this view, AI is nothing more than a tool\u2014and one that promises to have a decidedly positive impact on society. On the other hand, there is a dramatically opposing view that says something like, \u201cit is inevitable that all AI will lead to incredibly bad and harmful consequences\u201d. That\u2019s a different sense of inevitability right there. Tech pessimists seem to think that whatever we do, whichever domain we focus on in our AI deployment, the use of automated reasoning methods will always be somehow counterproductive or harmful.\n \nI think both views are wrong. The first view underestimates our ability to subject AI to productive scepticism, public oversight, and collective control. Even if it is inevitable that we will be using more and more AI in our collective decision-making processes, we ought to keep reflecting critically on AI\u2019s purpose. There might be some collective decision-making problem domains where it would be ethically and politically inadequate to use AI because we intuitively feel that when things go wrong in those domains, we want a human decision-maker to blame; we want somebody to *justify* to us why a particular decision outcome was reached. In those domains, we are often quite happy to not be maximally efficient or accurate. What we really want is to think and argue with each other about how best to arrange our political and social life, about what it would mean to have a just society, about how we can relate to each other as true equals. These are ultimately not just ethical, but fundamentally political questions. Of course, tech optimists might reply to the response that I just gave: \u201cbut clearly AI will optimize our collective decision-making!\u201d To that, I think a more nuanced and sceptical view might say in response, \u201cwell, optimising isn't everything\u201d. We must exercise our critical judgment to determine when optimising further and further, and thereby entrenching and accelerating our current social *status quo*, is actually what matters most. And in many cases, that might not be what justice requires. \n\nBut at the same time, the second view that I outlined before\u2014the tech pessimists\u2019 view\u2014can also be misleading. It is misleading in the sense that it equates all forms of AI and machine-learning, including their ethical importance and impact, with each other. I do not think that that is plausible at all. Not all forms of AI will lead to the same kinds of harmful outcomes. It is especially important to ask: where and how can we use AI to mitigate injustice rather than exacerbating it? Nuanced ethical and political engagement with new technologies requires avoiding sweeping generalisations. But, it is clear that, as a general principle, if using algorithmic decision-making in a particular decision domain moves us further away from justice, then we have a strong presumption against using it in that domain.\n\n\n**LS:** **Could we make AI more just by improving algorithms on a technological level, for example by defining mathematically what a fair algorithm would look like?**\n\n**AZ:** Computer scientists and statisticians (especially those working in a new, interdisciplinary research subfield called FATML\u2014Fairness, Accountability and Transparency in Machine Learning) have done a lot of important work recently. Amongst other things, FATML researchers have thought critically about whether simply distributing the same probabilities of obtaining a particular outcome across different socio-demographic groups is actually sufficient for an algorithmically fair procedure. The trouble is that there are multiple plausible mathematically defined fairness metrics, and we cannot optimise for all of them at the same time\u2014they are mathematically incompatible. Furthermore, as many FATML researchers have pointed out, algorithmic models will always interact dynamically with the world.\n\nThis sounds simple and intuitive, but it has dramatic implications for how we can and should tackle problems like unfair algorithmic decision outcomes. Assume that we manage to develop an algorithm that actually does adhere to whatever broadly plausible mathematical fairness desiderata we have articulated in the design stage, and then we deploy it in the world. But, unsurprisingly, the world is shaped by a history of inequality and injustice, and technological models interact dynamically with the social world. So, whatever new data gets fed back into our algorithmic model will reflect those inequalities in our status quo to some extent. So then, a decision rule within that algorithm that seemed ostensibly fair in the beginning, may not ultimately deliver truly equitable results. One consequence we might draw from this insight that models interact dynamically with the world is to say, \u201cwell, it\u2019s not decisive how well we mathematically articulate what the algorithm is supposed to be doing and in what way it\u2019s supposed to be doing it, if there is always going to be this dynamic interaction.\u201d \n\nThat would be a bad conclusion for us to reach, I think. To address the model-world interaction problem in a more meaningful way, we must ask: what is the *purpose* of using algorithmic decision making for a given problem in the first place? What\u2014and indeed whom\u2014are we defining as a problem? What sort of data are we trying to look at, and does that data really help us solve the problem? Which populations are most affected by technological innovation, both positively and negatively? In sum, we need to take a broader, socially and politically informed view\u2014not a purely technological view\u2014on algorithmic fairness.\n\n\n**LS:** **How can political philosophy help push us to think critically about AI and machine learning?**\n\n**AZ:** I think that one particularly useful resource in political philosophy is the long tradition of thinking about theories of justice. These are theories about how we should distribute benefits and burdens in society, but also about how we should relate to each other. So, it\u2019s not only about allocating goods and benefits to people, but also about thinking about the social relations and structures that we ought to create and maintain: what it means to respect each other as equals, and what we owe each other on an interpersonal level. What does it mean to treat each citizen in our society with respect, given that there are going to be some inequalities that we possibly can't eliminate? For example, we can\u2019t change the fact that people are born with different natural talents and abilities, but most of us think that your access to basic resources and basic rights shouldn't depend on those \u2018undeserved\u2019 features that you are born with. In addition, it is also plausible to think that if an individual or group is structurally disadvantaged in society, we should *prioritise* the interests and the voices of members of that group in processes of collective decision-making in some form. So, if we are going to have inequalities in our society, those inequalities ought to be arranged in a way that benefit those who are worst off the most. Many analytic political philosophers, especially those working in the 20th century, have been thinking about that question. In addition, feminist philosophers and critical race theorists have called our attention to the idea that we should not treat the social and political status quo as just by default: justice is not only about ensuring compliance with the rules governing our existing social institutions\u2014it is also about  transforming those institutions as a whole, and about being accountable for historical patterns of injustice. \n \nIn addition to theories of justice, another line of thought in political philosophy that is relevant for AI is the debate on *disagreement* and *dissent* in democratic societies. Thinking about disagreement is, I think, very important when we think about design decisions linked to AI and machine learning. To give a concrete example, suppose that we are using algorithmic tools to predict the risk that a criminal offender will reoffend in the future. One such algorithm is called COMPAS\u2014a tool that various states in the US having been using for a few years now\u2014to determine whether an offender is \u2018high risk\u2019 or \u2018low risk\u2019, and that according to a [well-known investigation by ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing), it was more likely to classify Black defendants as \u2018high risk\u2019 in comparison to similar white defendants. Of course, what it means to be a \u2018high risk individual\u2019 is subject to disagreement\u2014whether those who design algorithmic tools explicitly acknowledge that or not. Algorithms are not inherently neutral, because we still have to make conscious choices when we design systems, including choices influenced by implicit bias and stereotypes. Of course, we could try to approximate what *riskiness* in this context means by looking at things like: has this person committed previous offences? Is she in an unstable economic situation? Do her social networks include a lot of other people who recidivate? Some of those variables might be more appropriate to use than others, right? For instance, one might think it\u2019s inappropriate to make inferences from the behaviour of your friends and family whether you in fact will be guilty of criminal conduct again in the future. Some predictions might be more ethically and politically defensible than others. Similarly, we have to be attuned to the fact that even if you have a list of prior offences, that might be partially dependent on your social context, which we may want to consider as a mitigating factor. But it is often difficult to do just that when using algorithmic decision-making instead of human judgment: using tools like COMPAS doesn't allow us to take context into account sufficiently, and it simultaneously obscures the extent to which underpinning concepts in our algorithmic model are subject to wide social and political disagreement.\n\n**LS:** **Would it be right to say that disagreement is embedded in even the earliest stages of design?**\n\n**AZ:** Yes. Consider the use of algorithmic decision-making in credit scoring or in hiring. When designing algorithmic tools, for this purpose, we have to come up with a way of measuring who counts as \u2018a good employee\u2019 or as \u2018creditworthy\u2019. But those are not straightforward, unambiguous, and uncontroversial concepts. There are many ways of cashing them out, and if we do not think hard about what kinds of concepts we should be working with, bad things can happen. Amazon, for instance, was in the news recently because they used an algorithmic hiring tool that ended up having a disparate impact that disadvantaged women applicants, because the majority of applicants who had been successful at Amazon so far had been male. Suppose, for example, that an algorithmic hiring tool takes into account the number of years of coding experience for each applicant. Boys tend to be encouraged to start coding earlier in life than girls\u2014but the amount of years of coding experience might be differently predictive for different genders in terms of future success as a \u2018good employee\u2019 in the tech industry. So, a female Amazon applicant with five years of coding experience might be just as well-suited as a male applicant with ten years of coding experience, if their current skill set is on par\u2014but if the algorithm ranks \u2018years of coding experience\u2019 much more highly than \u2018current skill set\u2019, the algorithm will keep favouring male applicants.\n\nThe bottom line is: concepts always have moral and political baggage. If we fail to engage with that problem, we risk developing technology that becomes less and less representative of what the world is really like, in all its complexity. We risk ending up with technology that isn't merely inaccurate, in the sense that it doesn't faithfully represent the real world, but also with technological tools that fail differently for different people. \n\n**LS:** **Earlier, you mentioned that the wider public might not necessarily be fully informed about what algorithmic decision-making and AI, in their current form, actually are. What are some of the most crucial areas about which the public is mis-or underinformed?**\n\n**AZ:** I think that one misconception is that a lot of people think of AI as something akin to the highly sophisticated, autonomous artificial agents that we see in dystopian sci-fi movies: those kinds of \u2018general\u2019 AI would be able to operate across a whole range of different tasks, and would not be dependent on humans pre-defining decision problems for them. That's not the kind of AI we are dealing with now, or even in the foreseeable future. Right now, we are using domain-specific tools (sometimes called \u2018narrow AI\u2019) which are far away from being conscious, autonomous agents similar to humans. Irrespective of that fact, humans often attribute some form of agency to technological systems. This is dangerous: whenever the use of algorithmic decision-making leads to unjust outcomes, we can't exclusively blame the technology. The agents which we have to hold accountable instead are human decision makers\u2014including private corporations who develop technology, and governments who choose to procure and deploy it. And once it becomes well-known that technology leads to unjust outcomes, we also need start thinking of ourselves\u2014regular citizens\u2014as people who are responsible for addressing problems like algorithmic injustice together, in the arena of democratic decision-making. Without that, I think citizens are not truly living up to their collective responsibility of safeguarding, and indeed *demanding*, equal freedom and justice for all.\n\n**LS:** **In your recent essay,**[ **\u201cTechnology Can\u2019t Fix Algorithmic Injustice\u201d** ](http://bostonreview.net/science-nature-politics/annette-zimmermann-elena-di-rosa-hochan-kim-technology-cant-fix-algorithmic) **, published in the *Boston Review* earlier this year, you make a bold claim: \u201cthere may be some machine learning systems that should not be deployed in the first place, no matter how much we can optimise them\u201d. That argument stands in clear contrast to some common ideas and aspirations in the tech industry, which rely on a sense of limitless potential, efficiency, and continuous optimisation in relation to AI. What factors contribute to making some machine learning systems unfit for deployment, and perhaps even dangerous for society?**\n\n**AZ:** I think that one good example of the so-called non-deployment argument \u2013 the argument that we just shouldn't deploy particular types of AI systems in particular domains to solve particular problems, no matter how much we can optimise AI in that domain \u2013 is the current debate about facial recognition technology, which is used in law enforcement, for instance. What many people do not know is that fifty percent of American adults are [currently in a facial recognition database](https://www.perpetuallineup.org/) that law enforcement has access to. These databases don't only include mugshots, they also include images from drivers\u2019 licenses. So, a huge part of the population is already assessable by facial recognition systems, here and now. In several American cities, including San Francisco, activists argued that they did not want their cities to deploy these tools, and subsequently, these cities decided to ban them. One primary concern was not only the fact that so many people are represented in those databases without having clear recourse mechanisms, so that there isn't a clear due process path for people who get assessed inaccurately by those facial recognition tools. A potential for mass surveillance obviously affects all citizens, but there is also a more specific, injustice-based concern that these kinds of tools have been empirically shown to be less accurate for people of colour. If you are already disadvantaged in society by structures of racial injustice, then the use of facial recognition tools will oppress you further.\n\n**LS:** **How should tech and policy practitioners approach AI ethics?**\n\n**AZ:** Not everybody in the tech industry has to get a PhD in philosophy\u2014but practitioners need to start seeing themselves as people who are *already* unavoidably making decisions of ethical and political significance. There is no such thing as a \u2018purely technological issue\u2019\u2014technological choices are to some degree always political and ethical choices. Also, I think it\u2019s important for practitioners to bear in mind that ethical reflection is never a process that is done unilaterally, and it\u2019s never a process that is *done*, so to speak. We shouldn't approach AI ethics as something like a [checklist](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2019/03/25/ai-ethics-seven-traps/). We should not think of ethics as a final \u2018quality control\u2019 check that we simply run once after we've developed a particular technology. We should have ethical goals in mind *before* we deploy, but we should also be very open to *changing* those ethical goals once we do deploy and once we see what effects that technology has in the world. Recall the problem of model-world interactions that I mentioned before: because of it, we might simply not *foresee* certain problems, we might not be able to accurately forecast the *magnitude* of problems, we might not be able to predict how different technological systems *interact* with each other, and we may not be able to accurately predict how *humans* change their behaviour once they know they are subject to algorithmic assessments. All of these problems require that we keep our ethical critique going, rather than approaching it as a static, one-time process.", "created_at": "2020-05-06 14:40:58.580279", "updated_at": "2020-12-11 14:56:22.800411", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4163, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 658.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4934, 6407, 5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84043, "user_id": 4640, "topic_id": 14500, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hi, Alberto-\n\nFor an economist you have a poor opinion of economists, and an exaggeratedly positive one of anthropologists.\n\nWhich is a bit odd to me \u2014 I have been drawn very much to both Mauss and Graeber in my studies, and have incorporated much from their world-view into my own. That said, it seems to me pretty clear that Mauss was more of a scientist; Graeber by the end was basically an activist and advocate rather than a scientist.\n\nMauss\u2019 The Gift should have revolutionized the study of  Macroeconomics by showing the extent to which gift-giving and personalized exchange is a powerful force in every economy, including capitalism \u2014 this is why Piketty\u2019s point is insufficient \u2014 you don\u2019t need an abstract point like \u201cr>g\u201d to figure out why the rich get richer: these are humans \u2014 they are always more likely to give their business to people they know. But it also explains why socialism fails: again, these are humans \u2014 bureaucrats are more likely to help those they know and/or those who give them gifts \u2014 you scratch my back, I scratch yours. Lenin could have done with a better understanding of how humans operate before he set up his system \u2014 but Lenin was no dummy \u2014 he must have known that he could set up a network of mutually dependent kommissars by ensuring that it was always his people who had the power to give financial and other rewards.\n\nSo to this extent I am disappointed in my peers in the profession. That said, I recognize the benefits of conservatism. Economics has avoided the excesses of anthropology, which, like Graeber, has often abandoned science in favor of activism.

In the past three years, he and the organizers of the event created online tools to keep participation and co-creation high. \n\nDevelopment of tools was necessary as the event has tripled in size in only three years. \n\nIn his speech, he talks about the design philosophy behind these tools, drawing parallels to the ancient silk road. These tools have since are being used by at least five other events around the world.

However we have evidence that the activity on \\#spot-the-future ripples also on different campaigns, which we want to know also.\n\nThe first network analysis we are going to tackle is the collaboration of users within \\#spot-the-future, looking at how \\#futurespotters reply to each other on different posts.\n\nWe will create for this purpose a multiplex network of users in which an edge is a direct reply to another user.\n\nTo look at the \"ripple\" effect of \\#spot-the-future in other missions, with the same group of users, we will create a bipartite network (or affiliation network) of these people to all the posts they are participating in \\#EdgeRyders. If I noted it well, @Alberto, there is about 9000 comments to scan, right?\u00a0\n\nLater on, with the help of @Inga Popovaite , we'll do further analysis... but I leave this for another post.

It is a marathon in the outskirts of kathmandu valley where we have been planning to develop a cycling trail as it's a beautiful place near Kathmandu which is extremely rich in culture too. \n\nOne can enjoy an escape from monotonous life at Kathmandu at least for a span of 2 weeks, and that too for a noble cause. Funds that have been raised through these marathon events previously, is being used in providing scholarships for deserving children who belong to economically deprived families around Tarakeshwar municipality. \n\nVolunteers will be given specific areas around Tarakeshwar for promoting the event. The event promotion campaign will incorporate community outreach sessions which can be made as creative as possible by volunteer themselves. Foreign volunteers can use these community outreach sessions to carry out work (surveys, documentary, etc.) of their own, simultaneously. \n\nSo,if anybody is interested to visit Tarakeshwar and  make use of this volunteering opportunity or even for participation, please go through the contact details above . If your friends are in Kathmandu, you can mention them in the comments below.\n\nEvent date : 4th November 2017\n\nP.S.

To me, the most relevant part for NGI from that viral video is probably \"How do we want to deal with opinions and political campaigns on the Internet?\" That's the discussion that the video stirred here in Germany; basically \"who can say what and when online about politics and how does it have to be marked\".

I need to reflect on why I got this reaction: was it the quasi-legalese (\"force majeure\")? Was it the organizational \"we\"? (Notice how open carers communicate: there's no \"we\" in [this post](https://diyps.org/2017/08/09/what-you-should-know-about-closed-looping-diy-like-openaps-or-otherwise/), there's \"you should do X\" and \"I am doing it this way\"). Was is the implication that taking care implies a liability for the care-giver, which is a powerful incentive to retreat into the impersonal world of professional care, insurance policies and liability waivers?\n\nI am re-reading David Graeber's _Debt_, and cannot help framing this debate in terms of his theoretical architecture. I tend to see this open care stuff as what Graeber calls baseline communism. Worth copying him word for word:\n\n> If you really care about getting something done, the most efficient way to go about it is obviously to allocate tasks by ability and give people whatever they need to do them.\n\nAccording to Graeber, this is an arrangement which has nothing to do with contracts. It is asymmetric by definition. Asymmetry is what makes it efficient: \"from each according to her possibilities\". Contracts, however, arise in exchange, which is a completely different principle from baseline communism. In exchange, people perceive themselves as more or less equal. One can accept something from the other (like in baseline communism and in hierarchy, the third organising principle considered  by Graber), but now the person accepting something is in debt. Upon repaying the debt, equality is restored. \n\nSo maybe I am unconvinced by the language of contracts, because they contradict my impression that open care is based on baseline communism rather than exchange and reciprocity. Not sure. At least one of the commitments of the contract (ok, aspirations, if commitments is too strong), insurance/financial measures of risk mitigation are explicitly rejected by the Amish in the name of something economists would call moral hazard. They use, instead, skin in the game.\n\nA second problem (not with the contract but with your comment, is that you seem to assume that people burn out _because_ they cannot provide standards, monitor etc. I do not see evidence for causality. I invoke Ockam's Razor: you see people burnout and initiatives fail because most initiatives fail, and in so doing burn initiators out. It is just as probable that people burn out because they overextend, in the attempt not to curtail others' right to care. I have no evidence for that either, but maybe we can ask \u2013 once again \u2013 @amelia if she has any wise things to say on \"what things look like from out here\". \n\nFinal point. Oversight, standards etc. are, I think, definitely overhead when you are operating on this kind of edge.  Do you believe otherwise? Can you explain? Here's my argument, by example: the [DIY pancreas](https://diyps.org/) exists _because_ the inventors said \"screw FDA approval, it will never happen, not in time. We can't sell it, but we can give schematics away under legal protection for free speech.\" If they had followed due process, the solution would not exist. It is not a coincidence that their slogan is the same as NightScout's: #wearenotwaiting. If this is not a call to cut corners of due process, I don't know what it is. \n\nOn the other hand, these people are going to great lengths to make sure their fellow diabetes patients are OK. They _are_ monitoring, they _are_ trying to extend the area of coverage, they _are_ trying to get ever better etc. But (1) they are doing it because they are decent people; no need to add a written commitment, because they are already committed; and (2) people are treated as adults, very smart adults in fact (\"Remember, everyone learns differently \u2013 and everyone\u2019s diabetes is different. Figure out what works well for you, and rock it!\") . Even with the schematics and the tutorials, it is far from trivial to build yourself am artificial pancreas. In other words, these efforts to improve are themselves best effort. But that's OK \u2013 having a potentially fatal condition works great for giving you focus.", "created_at": "2017-09-06 22:07:44.665853", "updated_at": "2017-09-06 22:14:25.952144", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 711, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 8.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [35659], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50646, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 9464, "post_number": 3, "raw": "The five stages of grief...", "created_at": "2019-02-07 09:22:50.776562", "updated_at": "2019-02-07 09:22:50.776562", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 4.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [50644], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71376, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 12827, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Thanks a lot!\n\nWe are now receiving applications and scheduling interviews, so thanks to those applying too,\n\nWe will close this thread as soon as we finalize this.", "created_at": "2020-03-16 08:40:04.821842", "updated_at": "2020-03-16 08:40:04.821842", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 250.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [71326], "is_liked_by": [3325, 3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54313, "user_id": 5129, "topic_id": 10047, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Cze\u015b\u0107, nazywam si\u0119 Magda \u0141uczyn i g\u0142\u00f3wnie m\u00f3wi\u0119 o sobie, \u017ce jestem aktywistk\u0105.

A solid wall, on the other hand in whatever form it takes and no matter how many windows and doors it possesses, it is a rock wall. Thus a house, like a case from which it derives is a dark secret (like that \u201csecret place of the heart\u201d, a home), and a tent, like a nest in a tree of which it is a descendent, is a place where people assemble and disperse a calming of the wind. In a house, things are possessed; it is property, and this property is defined by walls. In a tent, things are experienced; it assembles experiences, and this experience is subdivided and diversified by means of the tent wall, The fact that the tent wall is woven - i.e. a network - and that experiences are processed on this network is contained within the word screen. It is a piece of cloth that is open to experiences (open to the wind, open to the spirit) and that stores those experiences. Since ancient times, the screen wall has stores images in the form of carpets; since the invention of oil painting in the form of exhibited pictures, since the invention of film in the form of projected pictures, since the invention of television, it has acted as a screen for electromagnetically networked images, and since the invention of computer plotters, the tent wall, now in an immaterial form has made possible the subdivision and diversification of images thanks to the processing of its network.

The actual work:</strong>\n\nBasically it's engaging people doing interesting work in Egypt outside the mainsteam to sign up on edgeryders.eu, submit their own solutions oriented stories, and share their own experiences as comments and posts on the stories submitted by others. In Egypt and in different parts of the world (the community consists of almost 2000 individuals in 40+ countries). The idea is to discover one another's approaches, and get a deeper, shared understanding around the different themes. And then to we get collaborating on shared solutions, or helping one another develop/strengthen/ scale existing projects, during the physical workshops. Without the online interaction it is difficult to collaborate, p2p, with people all over the planet. Or even the person around the corner who it is difficult to interact with because of invisible barriers.\n\nThe other part of the work is preparing all the communications materials in Arabic and use social media to draw people into edgeryders.eu. This includes producing mission briefs: engaging calls for submissions of more solution centric essays, and commenting the ones that already are online from an Egyptian perspective. It also involves a lot of work reaching out to people and networks and draw them into signing up on edgeryders.eu and \u00a0participating in the conversation on the platform.

Some join in, actively listening, asking questions or giving thoughtful responses. (This is a safe place and not for debating opinions or speaking for others.)\n\nThe discussion begins with first hand accounts of attempts taken to solve societal issues and moves to navigating the personal challenges experienced by members. Nuances and the various different contexts surrounding these challenges begins to show.\n\n**Information analysis**\n\nNext open source technology is used to make connections between topics being discussed, the people discussing them, places, projects, solutions and struggles. When we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources.\n\nBy the end of the process, our community members have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n\n## What comes out of it\n\n|Inputs|Platform|Outputs|Outcome|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Good People|Conversation|Articles|Clusters of local actors that together try out new ideas to secure resilient livelihoods for their communities and themselves.

I did, and here are my thoughts.\n\n\n## 1. Are online interactions legitimate ethno data? (TL,dr: yes)\n\n> Organizational ethnographers who rely principally on interviewing and ocular observation are unlikely to obtain firsthand access to their informants\u2019 language, actions, and perceptions of organizational life because these are digitally mediated and not amenable to observation (Barley & Kunda, 2001; Beaulieu, 2010; Czarniawska, 2008; Knorr Cetina & Bruegger, 2002). In turn, the researchers\u2019 ability to convey the vitality of organizational life is diminished, threatening their claim to ethnographic authenticity (Golden-Biddle & Locke, 1993).\n\nThis is a rather tall claim. I have no idea about *organizational* ethnography, but we who live important parts of our lives online have become apt at navigating digital interactions using the equivalent of body language (emoticons, choice of words, choice of omissions, frequency of connecting...). @howard_rheingold  chronicled the deep human emotions and emerging culture at work in online communities already in 1993; his work shows clearly that these emotions and that culture is accessible through purely digital interaction \u2013 no need to be looking over the shoulder of the people typing on their keyboards. \n\nIs there really support for this \"ocular\" stuff, @amelia? Does this mean that there can be no blind ethnographers? It does not sound reasonable. In fact, later in the paper it seems the opposite claim is made: if you *don't* pay attention to digital, you record insufficient diversity (in organizational ethnography, maybe, the meeting room is policed more attentively by senior management than most email threads):\n\n> Ethnographers who rely on interviews and direct observation within an organization\u2019s offices may miss out on important interactions.\n\nThe paper has a nice discussion of the \"archivability\" of digital ethnographic raw data:\n\n>For instance, in a systematic review of online ethnography, Tun\u00e7alp and L\u00ea (2014), argue that online ethnography \u201cis entirely mediated by multimedia artifacts such as texts, pictures, videos, etc.\u201d (p. 64). From this perspective, digital data are omnipresent and \u201ctemporally suspended.\u201d Digital data are thus considered quasi-permanent and distinct from social action. According to Tun\u00e7alp and L\u00ea, the implication for researchers is that synchronous observation of the processes of creating digital data is equivalent to ex post analysis of digital archives.\n\nI would problematize this, because dynamic data are quite difficult. Even if every action on a digital platform is timestamped, plenty of unobserved events complicate the picture. If Alice writes a post in a thread at 16.03, and Bob writes another post in the same thread at 16:07, can we assume that Bob has read Alice's post and is reacting to it? Under which circumstances? In my own work I had to make a lot of assumptions to get to a well-defined model of interaction online. \n\nLater in the paper, the authors make the claim that such data are objective, because \"unobtrusive\". This seems to support our (@amelia's, @melancon's, @markomanka's and mine) that it makes sense to do ethno work on the automatically recorded interactions on online platforms such as Edgeryders. Yes, I am aware Figures 1 and 2 represent pure social networks, with no semantics at all. But the faith in the server log as a legitimate source of ethno raw data is there.\n\n> Since the employees\u2019 digital traces were unobtrusively recorded (without my agency), they were objective, allowing me to balance perspectives of politically motivated gatekeepers like Ai. Accessing the company\u2019s email logs would enable me to be co-present (Bate, 1997; Beaulieu, 2010) to observe the digital interactions by which my informants conducted a significant amount of work. In the process, I could improve authenticity and multivocality of my research.\n\n\n## 2. The guidelines\n\n> Guideline 1: Follow Participants\u2019 Digital Interactions\n\nNo argument.\n\nHere, the paper has a nice discussion on ethics, though it is not directly relevant to what we do. Reason: the privacy implications of reading people's emails from the company server are not the same as reading people's post on a public forum, as we do.\n\n> Guideline 2: Exploit Opportunities to Digitally Discover and Represent Marginalized Voices\n\nThe authors claim that SNA is a good fit for this, as it allows to discover peripheral people and amplify their voices.\n\n> Guideline 3: Broaden the Evidentiary Approach\n\nThis seems to mean two things:\n\n1. Exercise judgment when applying a method. For example: does more frequent exchange of email really map to stringer social connections *in this context*? \n\n2. Apply \"methodological pluralism\". Use different methods on the same data (example: participant observation + SNA). If the two methods tell the same story, you are on to something.\n\nAgain (mostly) no argument from me.", "created_at": "2019-02-20 19:00:36.733603", "updated_at": "2019-03-07 23:53:01.914414", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 793, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 147.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 4795, 854], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84044, "user_id": 3816, "topic_id": 14500, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I find it courageous that you can criticise your alma mater discipline so objectively, @alberto.

Housekeeping and first thoughts on configuration**\n\nAlready back then we decided to offer some sort of customization, so other people can change the behaviour of the platform for their own purposes. While development we also focussed on an easy way to deploy the application (at this time we used Heroku).\n\nAs I am revisiting the code some time later I've realised that still there are many things hard-coded which are too specific for the usecase in Berlin and also some design choices in how to handle the customization are not completly right.\n\nFirst I decided to update all dependencies of the project, as the last update is more than one year ago many things changed ( `sequelize` database orm), got deprecated or even removed (`react-router-redux` for replaced by `connected-react-router`).\n\nWhile this update required touching upon basically every layer of the application, it was good to get in touch with all parts of it again. I used the chance to improve some small things, like debug logging and better linting rules.\n\nAlso I changed the build system from `gulp` to `webpack`, as we had long build times during development (>30 seconds per build) in the end. With `webpack` it requires as much time for the first build, but later on its less than a second, which makes development much more convenient of course. :slight_smile:\n\nAs I changed the build system I realized that some platform configuration is already happening in the asset building process (like setting the Title of the page in the generated index.html). At this point some configuration was handled through an `.env` file, which was alright in the past but looks pretty ugly to me now. In the beginning we've decided to decouple the webapp from the server strictly, which meant that the whole app was hosted as a static page, nothing was rendered by the server. This was why we had to move some configuration-related tasks already in the building of the application assets.\n\nI decided to move all configuration into a database and decouple system related / low-level configs (database credentials, API keys etc.) from high-level configuration (Title of the page, Dates of the festival etc.). This has to be done in a later step, but as a first preparation I decided to render index.html file server-side and not in the asset building process.\n\n---\n\n```\nFirst \"housekeeping\" steps for upcoming improvements and changes to the codebase:\n\n    * Render _index.html_ via `pug` on server-side for easier customization\n    * Change build system from `gulp` to `webpack`\n    * Update deprecated `sequelize` methods\n    * Update all dependencies and asset building pipelines (Babel, scss etc.)\n    * Replace outdated `react-router-redux` with `connected-react-router`\n    * Introduce `LOG_LEVEL` env variable for more control over logs, improve `winston` logger\n```\n\nChanges related to this you can find in this PR: https://github.com/adzialocha/hoffnung3000/pull/36", "created_at": "2019-02-07 12:29:08.089645", "updated_at": "2019-02-07 12:37:51.345733", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 481, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 59.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62985, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 11359, "post_number": 4, "raw": "I see.

Plenty of people who either follow other stars (for example MMT folks \u2013 though they paid by being marginalized for a very long time) or magisterially use extensions of the neoclassical model (Stiglitz). But, in my perception, economics *is* a monolithic enterprise, or at least it tries to be. As a PhD student, you are told you must \"speak the language\" (micro, macro, econometrics) before you are allowed to specialize. My supervisor used to say that you could randomly draw any two economists in the world  and they would understand each other: they share much more vocabulary and background than, say, two chemists, or two historians.\n\nThe interesting question is: why? You could define economics as \"the discipline which looks at a certain set of problems, such as production, distribution, trade etc.\". And then you would have people with all sorts of theories, metrics and so on.

Problem context\n\nHow could plants in deserts grow without human intervention? The basic insight is that it _does_ rain in most deserts. Just very erratically \u2013 there could be one big rainstorm in 5 or 10 years. So the problem for plants is not so much the absence of rain, but how to store the water until the next rain. Because there is no soil that could store the water naturally, and the water storage capacity of soil is too limited anyway to store water for multiple seasons. It is also not practical to bring in that much soil (2-5 m depth maybe?) and even if that would be done, the dry topsoil would quickly be carried away by wind erosion.\n\n\n## 2. Basic idea\n\nThe following is a new technique to create maintenance-free, resilient forests (or at least groups of trees) right in the desert. It is based on the same principle as the \"sub-irrigation planter\" or \"self-watering pot with wick\" designs ([example DIY design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maoWthQVo94)), but adapted to the water needs of trees and to a potential for 10-year draughts. The basic design choice for a setup that never needs further human intervention is that we need a way of water storage where the water table does not vary much, but to compensate, the stored water will cover a larger surface area. The reason is that water can be extracted using capillary action (of soil, roots, or artificial fibers) if and only if the water table depth does not vary much. Capillary action is a completely maintenance free technique that can last for hundreds of years, very much unlike pumps, and also unlike setups where water under pressure slowly drops on plants (as in drip irrigation). Dirt and dissolved minerals in dripping water can plug the essential dripping holes, which would then require human intervention.\n\n\n## 3. Design proposal: with tunnels\n\nCapillary action can raise water by one or a few meters, depending on the fineness of the capillaries. So a 20 m deep hole in the ground is not suitable, obviously. However, a 2 m high, waterproofed tunnel drilled horizontally or with a <0.5% upwards slope into the hillside is suitable. Instead of one tunnel, it is also possible to make it branch off internally, increasing the storage area by a lot. Water from these tunnels would flow out of the tunnel into narrow canals, also at about 2 m water depth. The trees and other plants would be planted right on top of the canals, with the roots embedded in soil _above_ the water level, receiving water only through capillary action. This is because roots below the water table will quickly rot, killing the plant.\n\nNow to move the water from the canals vertically upwards through the soil to the tree roots, various mechanism can be used:\n\n* Filling the canals (but not the whole tunnels of course) completely with soil, which then mimics groundwater; to prevent water loss, it is still important that the canals are watertight on all sides.\n\n* Wicks made from cotton or polyester fiber that hang vertically into the water-filled canals. Compared to soil, this has the advantage that the water access of the trees can be better regulated. For example, the wicks can be designed so that with decreasing water level, the water supplied to the trees also decreases in order to prevent running out of water. In addition, the sizing of the wicks would be adapted to the type and size of the tree. They should not supply too much water, as that instructs the tree to conserve water by growing thicker and more waxy leaves, which is obviously better for a desert location.\n\n* Porous bricks or other porous clay objects, as an alternative and perhaps more durable material to wicks made from fiber.\n\nNow for the tunnels to be filled during rainfalls, one would drill vertical or steeply sloped access holes, starting in natural drainage channels / rivulets and ending in the tunnel. They should be small in diameter (max. 20 cm) to prevent too much water from evaporating over the years, and can also incorporate a valve / flap mechanism to further prevent evaporation. And of course, there must be proper mechanisms to prevent animals (or even children) from falling into these holes.\n\nIn total, this mechanism can catch whatever rain falls on a higher ground, and will distribute it slowly over the next year(s) to plants on somewhat lower ground, such as the side of the hill. While soil (esp. hard sun-baked soil) has a limited rate of letting water seep in, the drainage shafts and tunnels can store water very fast in a downpour and will not waste any water when it is available.\n\n\n## 4. Design proposal: with covered ponds\n\nThis is quite similar to the design proposal with tunnels, but requires no tunneling or drilling \u2013 only digging. This seems much more appropriate, as it will be much cheaper.\n\nInstead of tunnels, it would use [artificial ponds](https://thepermaculturealternative.wordpress.com/2018/12/16/how-to-build-a-low-cost-rainwater-pond/), with a plastic liner at the bottom, running horizontally along a hillside or at the bottom of the hill. If built along the hillside, it can be built on a terrace, in a format such as 30 \u00d7 3 m. This allows to have groups of trees at several heights on the hillside. And instead of the vertical holes for water inflow, existing rivulets or gullies from the hillside can be redirected to flow into the pond. However, a way has to be found to deal with sediment buildup, for example using a settlement pond or a cyclone-type fluid filter.\n\nAll ponds have to be covered, to prevent evaporation during the potentially multiple years of water storage. If it is wider than about 3 meters, the covering would rest on pillars built in a grid fashion in the pond. Plants are then placed right on this covering, with enough soil \u2013 and that soil might have to be covered with slate sheets to prevent wind erosion. The soil is kept moist with wick-type fabric items hanging into the water below.\n\n\n## 5. Design improvements\n\n**Waterproof catchment areas.** These designs can be combined with covering hillsides in slate or cut natural stone slices, heavy enough to not be moved by wind. They would require to be cut in a special shape so that they overlap and interlock, not sliding down into the valley by their weight. For example, slabs of 40\u00d740\u00d75 cm that are laid with one corner pointing into the valley and have cutouts along their lower edges so that they overlap and interlock with the row of slabs below. Like on slate roofing, water will flow downhill into the pond without ever touching the ground, that is, without seeping into the ground. This way, even light rainfalls contribute to refilling the pond. This is very similar to the ancient Tunisian water harvesting technique of the _jessr_, but improves on it by changing the \"annual average runoff coefficient\" of the hillside catchment area. It was 0.153 in Amrich near Beni Kheddeche, measured between 199 and 2001 ([source](https://books.google.de/books?id=VVvBcpzdJP4C&pg=PA185)). This means, 15.3% of the water was runoff water and could be catched by the _jessr_ terrace farm, while 84.7% of the water was seeping into the ground and \"lost\" because non-concentrated rainfall is not enough for agriculture around Beni Kheddeche. With covered hillsides, the lost 84.7% of the water can also be covered, which means that about 84.7% / 15.3% = 5.9 times more growing area can be used in the Beni Kheddeche area.\n\n**White hillsides.** Now while we are already up for covering the hillsides with waterproof material, let's use white or bright material. When applied in a large enough area, it will bring down the average outdoor temperature by several degree Celsius. For example, the white polytunnel greenhouses around Almeria, Spain, decreased the temperature in the area by 3 \u00b0C, and that in spite of global warming. Of course, the question is how to make this also aesthetically pleasing and safe for wildlife. So we better want to use slices of white natural stone and not plastic. If white stone slabs are not available locally, the dark stone can be painted with lime or other natural white pigments. Alternatively, the stone slabs (whether white or dark) can be covered, as there is no need to expose the stone slabs directly. So for better aesthetics, they can be covered with white gravel or white stones of various sizes, giving the place a more natural look. The only requirement is that the cover material does not soak up much water when it rains, and also does not leak many sediment particles when it rains. Terraces with trees and other plants would be dispersed within these white-covered hills in different heights, making for a beautiful view.\n\n**White stone cover for the soil.** And while we are at it, let's also place white stone slabs on the soil around the trees. This helps to keep the ground cool by reflecting sunlight, preventing evaporation. It also helps against wind erosion.\n\n**Variable water use.** Trees, especially olive trees, take a long time to grow and are very valuable. The hydrology system must ensure their survival with the highest priority. So it will be very conservative with water use and tree numbers to be able to water the trees even through multiple drought years. This also means that in most years, excess water is available and can be used in agriculture for annual plants like wheat, barley etc.. In dry years, the annual plants will simply not be planted, waiting until the water storage has filled again to be sure of tree survival first.\n\n**Reducing soil evaporation.** When planting trees in soil that is moistened by wick action from the proposed reservoirs, the water is not directly exposed to the air, which greatly reduces evaporation. Still, there will be considerable evaporation as the moist soil is exposed to the air. This can be considerably reduced by placing a layer of plastic sheet material or of water-impermeable soil (clay) on top of the root soil, and then some more soil or rather gravel and sand on top of that for protecting that layer. This way, only the planting holes expose moist soil to the air.", "created_at": "2019-04-03 13:34:25.521950", "updated_at": "2020-06-03 21:37:08.859396", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1753, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 502.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3703, 4, 3812], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59338, "user_id": 5275, "topic_id": 10710, "post_number": 30, "raw": "this sounds very very interesting.

Sicily\u2019s economy and society have long been crippled by high unemployment, inefficient public services, corruption and organized crime. \n\nYet, over the past ten years or so, a small cohort of about 120 enterprises in Messina, working closely together, have managed to build a solid, long-termist, fair, human-centric economy \u2013 and achieve stability and prosperity in the process. They call themselves \u201cthe Messina advanced cluster\u201d.\n\nTo get where they are now, they had to re-invent a lot of economic concepts. \n\nThe familiar ones (\u201cmaximizing shareholder value\u201d, \u201ccorrect market failures\u201d etc.) were simply not working out for Sicily, and for their goals. \nSo, as they re-built their local economy, they developed their own economic thinking, with concepts such as \u201crelational goods\u201d, \u201cstocks as autonomy\u201d,\nand \u201csystems, not networks\u201d. \n\nEven their innovation is weird: solar panels made out of the pulp of waste oranges?

As the Dunbar Number is just a suggested cognitive limit, we will explore its implications for well being without wading into dogma. What does awareness for the Dunbar number do for our personal ability to care for ourselves and each other? We will attempt to formulate strategies for healing, learning from ancestral and contemporary precedent, and leave with tools that hopefully can scale in our native environments.\n\nBelow is a brief interview with Harrison Chiu of Biosphere X, summing up the objectives and findings of his amazing presentation on the Dunbar number at the OpenCare Festival:\n\n**WB: Can you give a brief summary of the objective of your presentation?**\n\nHC: I wanted to present a usable Dunbar number framework, from looking at it from outside in and inside out, to people.

In 2012 I co-founded an NGO that is involved in cultural policy and cultural management-directed activities and with it I was involved in cultural planning for Timisoara (we did their cultural strategy for the next 10 years :) ), but also, cultural governance for heritage management, advocacy for cultural initiatives, acces to contemporary art in rural areas and development through culture, citizens consultations for new cultural and creative public projects, all sort of research etc. You can read more about me here:\u00a0http://ralucapop.m3culture.ro/ and about CubicMetre - resources for culture NGO here www.m3culture.ro.\n\nLast year I started to coordinate a new project, that aims to form a network of people interested to bring the arts in the education system in Romania and develop resources to better understand and train those that do arts in education. It is called <em>Support culture in education</em>, it is inspired by the Cultural Rucksack in Norway and we are now in the middle of its implementation. More about it here: www.culturaineducatie.ro.\n\nI think that forming or contributing to networks has always been my interest, I see its need everyone I look in Romania, but mostly in the cultural realm. I am part of several networks myself and would be happy to tell you more about them: The Coalition of the Independent Cultural Sector, Culture Action Europe (as organisations), and recently the Coalition of Open Educational Resources (very recently).\n\nI am very curious to meet you in person, see what everyone is doing (some of you I know, some of you I don't) and to start sharing ideas and resources for new and interesting activities and projects :)\n\n<span>Raluca\u00a0</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-21 08:34:36", "updated_at": "2018-02-09 06:48:04.252197", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 383, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12168, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1718, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>I'm aware of this distinction</b>\n\nbetween institutions and people who make the institutions, sometimes I forget to put an emphasis on it.

So similar with mine in many ways.\n\nFirst time I came to Belgium was in 1999, high school. I got enrolled in Institut catholique Saint Boniface in Ixelles. Had a very weird episode there with the principle inviting me to his office, trying to find in a shady way if I was Ortodox or Catholic, beeting around the bush, then giving me special treatment when he found out. I also saw how all the kids kept separate in school, divided by race, it felt so wrong. I left Belgium 2 months later, disgusted.\n\nWhen I moved to Brussels again 2 years later I found it refreshing nobody was asking me about my nationality or religion out of some hidden agenda, if it happened it was out of curiosity. I met people from all over the world and it was an amazing experience.\n\nEven though I have changed so much, just like you. The thing is, I believe we changed way more than people who stayed in our countries...it's just that we perceive they changed a lot :wink:. \nI am not distanced from local politics at all, especially not the one in Balkans. At first I resented it, felt powerless and frustrated, but as time passed by I felt I cannot just ignore it. I feel there is more hope and potential for change there, here the system became too strong. Also the change is more urgent there than here in western hemisphere but not for the reasons you might think.\n\nFew years in I realised how special Brussels was and, in spite all the things I resent about it, it is by large the reason I keep coming back to it. Brussels is a city of nomads, of expats, of people out of place but actually in perfect place for them...you might say we form a new nation. Nation based on similar experiences, feelings, perception or belief...I would say it is a belief we are human above all.\n\nNations are a rather recent invention in human history so I really don't see why should anyone look at it as something permanent, I don't. I believe more and more people realise this and in fact solution to accelerate such an evolution is to create better living conditions. From what I see, poorer someone is more likely he is to be influenced by manipulators using nation, race, religion or any other mean to create bigger divisions in society and rule on that foundation of fear of 'the other side'. \n\nAnd yes, as @natalia_skoczylas said, result of me moving so much around is that I  feel at home everywhere as well :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2019-09-04 15:30:17.192640", "updated_at": "2019-09-04 15:30:17.192640", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 452, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 74.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4, 1856, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63976, "user_id": 5201, "topic_id": 11436, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Wow, that's funny AND a great way to show how small villages here and there die, without anyone noticing it.

Which would you want to start doing/do more of?**\n\nMy twin passions are music and human development, converging in the survival of human joy. While music was my former profession, and I want to do more of this as a hobby in future, my main mission now is to get the world \"konnekted\", whereby everyone will learn, train, and use KONNEKT - a universal psychosocial operating system which I have uncovered - as a lived part of daily culture. This means I want to focus on content creation, advocacy, presentation, and training of my material. I want to avoid anything which keeps me from this eg paying the bills, hourly paid work etc.\n\n**What is an a question or desire that drives you or your work?** \n\n\u2022 What are the fundamentals of the life process which we share beyond differences in life conditions, culture, language, intelligence, worldview complexity, personality, and beliefs?\n\n\u2022 How can we focus our attention at scale on those fundamentals, rather than on our conceptual identity differences, in order to align our energies and collaborate effectively - as individuals, communities, societies, and as a species - around shared existential and ethical purposes?\n\n\u2022 What is one attentional process we can adopt at scale such that, by doing it, it would make everything else easier, or unnecessary?\n\n**How did you get started and what hurdles have you met along the way?**\n\nThe idea for KONNEKT started nearly a decade ago after 15 years of intense personal development exploration, and the hurdles I have met along the way are mostly resistance - both internal and external.\n\n**Which doubts do you have about the work you are doing and the path forward?**\n\nI don't have doubts about my mission, only unknowns and uncertainties in how to reach critical mass of adoption in time to be effective.\n\nLegal structure: which one to adopt (non-profit, foundation etc)\n\nBusiness model: how to spread the KONNEKT meme as fast as possible while becoming financially self-sustaining.\n\n**What kind of support would you like to offer others traveling a similar path?**\n\nDevelopmental coaching, feedback, content input. Spiral Dynamics understanding and assessment in depth.\n\n**Great, now that you've made it easier for us to introduce you to the others \u2013 start to think about the topic and purpose of the event itself.

I believe strongly that a viable and ethical future for humanity and the ecosphere lies in the direction of radical simplexity and collective humility in the face of existential natural realities. I cannot think of anything more important than enabling a developmental flow from competition to cooperation to collaboration, and building new forms of resilient konnekted cultures.\n\n**name:** Adam Pearson", "created_at": "2019-11-18 11:08:15.710468", "updated_at": "2020-05-18 14:40:20.362591", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 600, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 167.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 5191, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59324, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10369, "post_number": 14, "raw": "It took some time, but here's the first draft @matthias. Please add your comments when you have time so we can push this out (I'll add in links later, plus pics: do you have a nice pic of yourself?)\n\n**This CTO has lived off the grid in his truck for over/ almost a decade \u2014 here&rsquo;s why**\n\n_&ldquo;I made myself a guinea pig of a minimal consumption lifestyle. It&rsquo;s all about experimental techniques that I use to drive resource consumption towards zero.&rdquo;_\n\nTucked away on the edge of a national forest in Germany stands a white, former firefighter, off-road truck with a folding mountain bike attached to the back. A long, thin, metal pipe sticks out of the top, and the smell of burning wood makes you wonder whether there&rsquo;s a wood burner inside. There is. This is what Matthias Ansorg, the CTO of Edgeryders, calls home.\n\n&ldquo;I want to at least show that an eco-restorative civilization is possible,&rdquo; he says.\n\nMatthias, who was once called a living synthesis of the arts by a friend \u2014 although he prefers systems engineering himself \u2014 lives an unconventional life. From making his own DIY coffee machines and developing a foldable 3D printer, to helping rebuild Nepal after the earthquake in 2015 and publishing books on how to change your city into an ecological civilization.\n\nThe drive to create a different kind of civilization has been part of his life from when he was just a kid, although Matthias can&rsquo;t really pin it to a specific moment. &ldquo;I was raised as a follower of Jesus Christ. And that&rsquo;s still where all my idealism and strong moral convictions come from,&rdquo; he explains, saying this value system is also exactly what prevents him to become a successful &ldquo;grown-up in this society.&rdquo;\n\nBut while living in a truck, DIYing hardware solutions to live a more sustainable lifestyle, and writing long manifests on how we can create tech-based eco-friendly societies maybe called &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; by some, to Matthias it&rsquo;s exactly what he&rsquo;s supposed to do.\n\nMatthias decided to use himself as a guinea pig to show that a zero consumption society is possible. For him, living this life doesn&rsquo;t fix anything necessarily, but it&rsquo;s a method that at least doesn&rsquo;t make our world worse: if you have to carry your water and wastewater in 20 one liter jerry cans in and out of a truck, you naturally adapt to changing your consumption behavior, Matthias explains.\n\nBeing extremely tech-savvy as he his, all the solutions he&rsquo;s coming up with are based on what is technologically possible.\n\nThe truck Matthias lives in has 9m\u00b2 living space which he heats in winter with a bit of wood scraps, a carbon neutral solution. Except for those two months in winter, he generates his electricity on the rooftop of his truck, with 400 W-PEAK solar panels.\n\nUsing only 600-700 Wh electricity a day, he consumes 90% less than the per-capita electricity consumption in Germany, the country where Matthias was born and raised. And he applies the same 90% reduction on water, buying &ldquo;new stuff,&rdquo; and trash generation.\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on a plastic shredder and a foldable 3D printer \u2013 foldable because it has to fit into my limited 9 m\u00b2 living space \u2013 to recycle all plastic trash into useful objects,&rdquo; Matthias says about his solutions.\n\nBut not all ideas Matthias worked on, have worked out as he had initially planned. A hairdryer, for example, isn&rsquo;t the most efficient tool to remove the parchment shells of green coffee beans.\n\nMatthias had set up a peer-to-peer marketplace where Nepalese coffee bean farmers could sell their products straight to the European customers. He wanted to pioneer &ldquo;globalization done right:&rdquo; leaving out the middlemen, supporting economic development.\n\nDue to miscommunication, unfortunately, the farmers sent over coffee beans that still needed their shells remover.\n\n&ldquo;Here we have 300 kgs of of coffee that need to be processed, with basically no equipment \u2014 and we find ourselves spending an afternoon cleaning coffee beans manually during a coffee hacking day at The Reef Brussels, Edgeryders&rsquo; co-working/co-living space,&rdquo; Matthias&rsquo; co-founder Nadia E. recalls. &ldquo;I still avoid drinking anything when I think about them, for the health of my laptop.&rdquo;\n\nIt&rsquo;s exactly that trial and error, however, that make innovation and change possible. Not only in creating new systems that could work, but also in changing your mindset.\n\nHis colleagues speak highly of him, even though he sees himself as a &ldquo;misfit.&rdquo;. Natalia, who he worked with in Nepal, says that his consistency in his life and ideals are admirable. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s truthful in a way few of us can be,&rdquo; she says, adding that our lifestyles are so often contradictory to what we preach and what we&rsquo;d want to see happen.\n\nHis work in Nepal \u2014 where Edgeryders worked with UNDP Nepal to research, contact and connect alternative leaders in Nepal using the Edgeryders platform \u2014 was also what made the most impact on how Matthias sees the world and how he acts. Especially when he returned back to Europe after several months.\n\n&ldquo;Nothing in Europe made sense anymore, all the luxury and resource waste felt just obscene, and on top of that Europe felt deeply miserable and hopeless,&rdquo; he says, adding that he feels he&rsquo;s an unusual person who&rsquo;s trying to make sense of the world differently from others he knows.\n\nThe difference in mentality in Nepal was especially striking to Matthias. The country, despite its poverty, felt hopeful. A water pipe supplying a house with city water, a road being paved to a town, the people saw bits and pieces of progress and expected more process to be made.\n\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say they should feel hopeful: they&rsquo;re implementing the same type of wasteful, industrial, capitalist civilization that we got stuck in and that is implemented in more or less the same way everywhere on the planet. But I say, it feels so much better to feel hopeful! Without hope, a lot of resentment soon becomes political mainstream, as we can observe in Europe today,&rdquo; Matthias explains.\n\nAnd that is why he thinks we should rebuild civilization from scratch, while he&rsquo;s doing some foundational work hoping to inspire others to make it really happen.\n\nHe&rsquo;s hopeful. From a tech perspective, physics allows us humans to change our behaviors significantly \u2014 as an example, he mentions how much energy the sun radiates to earth every day. But it won&rsquo;t be without a massive effort from politicians, industries, and people themselves.\n\n&ldquo;When it comes, will be hard work for everyone. But it&rsquo;s meaningful work, and people will love it because it gives them hope and because they can leave their bullshit jobs behind,&rdquo; says Matthias.", "created_at": "2019-09-16 04:23:40.874886", "updated_at": "2019-09-16 10:23:16.696505", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1203, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 11.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58032], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54665, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 10029, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Do you have any examples of what you mean by UNL in this context and how much more radical would you be?", "created_at": "2019-06-06 16:42:31.047918", "updated_at": "2019-06-06 16:42:31.047918", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 22, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 12.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [54242], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77110, "user_id": 5667, "topic_id": 13595, "post_number": 12, "raw": "@owen Monday 18h CEST is good for @nadia", "created_at": "2020-05-20 19:40:35.940235", "updated_at": "2020-05-20 19:40:35.940235", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 22.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [77108], "is_liked_by": [3622], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79344, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13939, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I like that.\n\nWhat do you mean \"the arts bit\"?", "created_at": "2020-06-22 13:38:43.149072", "updated_at": "2020-06-22 13:38:43.149072", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 13.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64667, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11640, "post_number": 1, "raw": "As I reflect back on [the meeting we had at Commune de Forest](/t/11617), I realize that we might need to think some more about how we communicate The Reef's UVP, and how it is different from other projects.\n\nBrussels is abuzz with initiatives on housing. Historically, housing has been cheap here. But about 20 years ago prices started to grow faster then incomes. In their [presentation video](https://vimeo.com/95494996). Community Land Trust Brussels claim housing prices doubled from 2000 to 2010. The poorer strata of the population fell through the cracks, or felt they soon would. Everybody and their horse went to work on the problem. \n\nSo, when you talk to housing people (in the sense of decision-makers or other stakeholders) about co-living, they tend to group you with people doing social housing in all its forms. Social housing; \"intergenerational\"; \"vulnerable groups\", etc. The question hanging in the air is \"what do you guys do which is not already being done?\".\n\nThe answer, of course, is that we are doing decarbonization through behavioral change, and behavioral change through communal living. I have not heard of any project looking in this direction. Every project is \"green\", but the greenness is embodied in the artifacts (build with green technologies), not in the agents (condition people to live green). This is not necessarily easy to convey.\n\nI suggest we consider an investment in communication and imagery. Maybe an art exhibition?

Last year I started NomadGao, a coworking coliving place in Goa based on my first-hand experience as a coworker. \n\nWe are a small space with 15 to 20 coworking seats. Our focus has been more on human interaction, though the small scale helped us in experimenting with technologies\n\nLockdown gave us time to think about how our systems should be. We have automated and streamlined our systems more. I feel that people should focus more on building the community, making sure that everybody here is happy, and connecting to drive synergies or collaborations, than technology.\n\nCoworking has the potential to be a great equaliser. We have been working on skill share programs, but the government needs to focus on building the ecosystem of spaces and internet facilities in tier two, tier three rural cities. I feel that the worst has already happened, and now we are on a growth trajectory.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n![37bc7a02ea7da6c5578c05f5ec5daaf8051be294_2_1380x776|690x388](upload://sWERRANdZc0cFVUI7ea9sTuu3Q4.jpeg) \n*Meet Mayur at our event on 21/7.

Related to work, this was particularly interesting:\n\n> **Graeber:** And of course the pandemic has highlighted the reverse side of this: the more immediately your work helps other people the less you are likely to be paid.\n> **Q:** Health and care workers, factory and utility workers, shopkeepers\u2026 got celebrated during the pandemic. How come?\n> **Graeber:** Because the essence of their work is to do no harm. Just consider the emergency and care workers who are out there risking their lives so that the health system does not collapse. In theory, a labour movement is the strongest when their work is essential and brings a lot of bargaining power to the workers. So if the health and care workers would decide to strike for better conditions and better pay this would be the best possible moment. But in reality this does not happen.\n\nHowever, I don't agree with his characterization of open source work. Indeed, much open source work is started on nights and weekends but it matures in institutions and with corporate contributions. I would get into details, but I don't want to derail the conversation. The point still stands. There is a lot of uncompensated labor being done on the internet.\n\n> I would like to invite your perspective on this issue in the context of open source and the issue of \u201cmaking a living\u201d. Have you experienced examples of that?\n\nPersonally? Certainly. I found it impossible to get local information about COVID-19 cases, so I build a service myself: [ \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 The Corona Virus in Turin, Italy](https://nextjournal.com/schmudde/corona-in-italy). It's nothing brilliant, but there are others in my community that also want this service. The gap between the dynamic document I made and the people out there that I know want to read it is frustrating.\n\nIf I can provide the service to the right people (the more difficult part) then I can seek compensation that I can invest back into the work.\n\n> How would you like to solve this?\n\nThere are concrete lessons to learn from both Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. I still dream of a network where one person signals a good or service available in a virtual space they can control (i.e. not controlled by a 3rd party, like Facebook). The contemporary web is absurd because better models are so easy to imagine.\n\n- Decentralized: If I like a band, I should be able to go to their webpage and compensate an artist directly for their work. \n- Centralized: If I like a band, I can support them on a platform that they own with other bands (a cooperative like [Ampled](https://www.ampled.com/)). The people that make the content should own the platform.\n\n> How can we find an appropriate value system for value-creating work?\n\nIt's important to look at the models of the past while acknowledging what makes the internet unique.

The 32 signups and 12 new contributors figure is the one I'd be focused on first. It's a pretty high ratio. One in every 2.6 sign ups is contributing to conversations on here. I'd focus on encouraging the 20 remainder to contribute too. They are already interested in EdgeRyders and have signed up. It took a bit of time to do that from their day. I'd try and get them involved. What's stopping them from engaging? Are they cautious, are they really busy with other commitments in their life?\n\nI'm taking an example from a community newspaper I subscribed to recently. I got a welcome email from the editor, explaining what the newspaper was aiming to do and how it operates (on a subscription basis. It is completely dependendant on the community it provides the service for, not taking advertisinig to remain independent). The email encouraged me to get in contact the editor if I had any story ideas or would like something covered by the publication. She left her contact number at the end. It was very personable and almost intimate. \n\nIn the context of EdgeRyders, if I was perhaps cautious in contributing to the site, an email like that would abate any fears I'd have, and encourage me to contribute. I know some of the community managers directly message through the platform, could you send it to individuals' emails? EdgeRyders is based on community and a welcome email that explains what the organisation is doing, how it aims to do it, would be a good.\n\nThe email could show the person who signs up, how important they are to this ecosystem. For those who are busy (and a little impatient) I'd showcase some of the outcomes that have taken place from participaton on the platform. Some people are more visual so a link to a website or a photograph of a previous project could work.\n\nIf you look at the social media engagement too - 512 clicks from Twitter, and 695 from Facebook are very high volumes of people. Would you be interested in doing 'call to action' pieces on social media and a few explainers on what EdgeRyders does and why people should get involved. Social media could be a place where you put more focus on outcomes. Perhaps direct to a page that explains what EdgeRyders does, explans how the process works and details some of the outcomes to give an overview. Then also encourage people to sign up and join in the conversation. \n\nFrom the data can you see if people are more likely to sign up when they visit on a desktop or a mobile? Sometimes that can give you an idea on user experience etc. \n\nThanks, \nLaura", "created_at": "2020-06-22 13:04:30.813067", "updated_at": "2020-06-22 13:04:30.813067", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 494, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 72.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 6433, 4022, 6679], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65545, "user_id": 5884, "topic_id": 11858, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Mohamed Hassan** ,  24 years old , civil engineer , supply chain engineer \n**Mohamed Aboelkhee**r , 21 years old , student at faculty of law , public relationship\n**Saher Elamir** , 21 years old , student at faculty of agriculture , head production\n\n### our project\n**Biogas mobile units**\n\n**Propose:** to produce renewable energy by turning organic wastes into Biogas.\n\n**Explaining** : The main scientific idea that unit based on is to turn any type of organic matters into bio-fuel based on  **C** atoms in organic matters it can be produced by [ **anaerobic digestion** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_digestion) with [ **anaerobic organisms** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism); some type of bacteria which digest material inside a closed system, or [fermentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)) of biodegradable materials.\n\n### Customers\n\nwe handle the simplest man needing in a sustainable and safer manner.\nOn focusing for the most possible consumers we can name:\n - Farmers and farm owners\n - Distant areas and suburban\u2019s population\n### Company Advantages\n\n**COLEX** has the following advantages compared to competitors:\n\n **Mobile unit**\n\nSimple, practical designs.\n\nHigh quality, resist leaching problems\n\nSafe, non-toxic, and highly stable.\n\nEasy-to-assemble parts.\n\nAll components are manufactured in Egypt and made with high quality steel, and Plastic.\n\nQuick, 48-hour delivery since our goal is to keep at least 10 units available in stock.\n\nHigh-quality, interactive website.\n\nFace-to-face interaction with customers in addition to technical support.\n\n*Here is:*  \u201c**Google drive file for our presentation & documents**\u201d\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mov-83IG-1Asjqt5Jwt9WMd_H7xoFKZi?usp=sharing", "created_at": "2019-11-24 17:49:21.352985", "updated_at": "2019-11-24 18:55:47.064605", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 252, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 60.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5539, 3782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27234, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1865, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>And input via maps.</b>\n\nThanks for the hints, interested to see what people might recommend you finally.\n\nDorotea and me had also been looking for modules that could take and visualize a geolocation as a field value, and provide a vicinity search on that basis.

Really? A French economist and a Russian economist and a Chinese economist and an Argentine economist? And throw in an American. In what country was your supervisor trained?\n\nTo say nothing of specialities: a labor economist, and an environmental economist, and a finance economist, and a development economist. I'm starting to wonder if your supervisor was not a proponent of a myth of the unity of the culture of economists -- it has a kind of creepy \"Illuminati\" feel to it.\n\nPerhaps what he meant was the business of \"thinking like an economist\". There is a unity of approach to solving problems -- this is why Steven Levitt and the Freakonomics phenomenon of using econ analytical approaches to consider problems not usually thought of as econ problems has been so popular. It is a fairly loose unity, but maybe not utterly implausible. You drop the politics and drop the emotive side and dig down to an answer that is supported by the statistical evidence. Although I'm not sure that dropping the politics is feasible in, say, China. I have a Russian wife who worked for the IMF, and from what I have seen, Russian economists do mostly drop the politics, even now.\n\nAh, well, I firmly believe that eventually an ecological approach to the economy will triumph. It makes so much sense: industries are niches and interactions are transactions, but of course are strongly affected not only by the considerations of the individuals concerned, but also by the economic climate (see \"culture\"), by institutions (I'm a fan of Institutional Economics, but it doesn't go far enough), etc. \n\nThere is actually a specialty within economics: Evolutionary Economics. I have looked at it, and am sorry to say I have not read as much as I should have. But here is one of many examples:\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/what-we-publish/elements/evolutionary-economics\n\nHow much common ground there is between these folks and Finance economists?

They're working hard to rebuild the cultural community, support the local economy, and contribute to world culture. \n\n**And they [can't do it without your support](https://www.gofundme.com/f/artsakhfest).**\n\n![48357933_581104462330520_4375748780364922880_o|690x459](upload://xyHVrRpuspl99s3mVxJzVXnPgwo.jpeg) \n\nA little context: Nagorno-Karabakh is a region in the South Caucasus. During the Soviet Union it was part of Azerbaijan, but after the fall of the communist empire, a war broke loose between Azerbaijan and neighboring Armenia over the territory. Ever since, Karabakh has been in limbo: internationally still recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but de facto governed by its own administration with the support of Armenia.\n\nAnd it's this \"limbo\" that the organizers of ARTsakh recognized as a hurdle to culturally and economically prosper. That is why, last year, art curator @iriedawta took it on herself to \"decentralize art and culture from Yerevan, and help Stepanakert \u2014 the region's capital \u2014 evolve into a thriving international cultural center.\"\n\nAnna, who hails from Yerevan, Armenia, lived in Nagorno Karabakh for about a year: \"I realized that the lack of community space and community-based artistic interventions is the only solution to overcoming the isolation of the region and healing the people who experienced war for three generations in a row,\" she says about her drive to organize the festival. \n\nhttps://vimeo.com/348584418\n\nLast year, the festival took place in Stepanakert's Drama Theater: established in 1932, the abandoned building is located on a charming and historical central street in the capital, and a favorite spot of local youth to hang out. The building is often called \"the Beauty of Stepanakert\" by people living in Karabakh.\n\n\"I just felt a responsibility to revive this building as it was the community space for decades and the only building of historical and cultural importance that survived the war,\" says Anna. \n\nOver 40 local and invited artists from the US, Iran, Israel, Switzerland, Poland, Germany and Turkey participated in the 3 day-event hoping to revive the past glory of the theater building and build the local arts community.\n\nCheck out these projects to understand what happened last year:\n\n[\u201cLearning How to Fly\u201d Project by Laura Arena](https://www.civilnet.am/news/2018/10/26/ARTsakh-Fest-%D5%8D%D5%B8%D5%BE%D5%B8%D6%80%D5%A5%D5%AC-%D5%A9%D5%BC%D5%B9%D5%A5%D5%AC/347453)\n\n[\u201cTake Your Seat\u201d Project by Susanna Arakelyan and Marcel Mayer](https://www.civilnet.am/news/2018/10/27/ARTsakh-Fest-%D4%B6%D5%A2%D5%A1%D5%B2%D5%A5%D6%81%D6%80%D5%A5%D6%84-%D5%B1%D5%A5%D6%80-%D5%BF%D5%A5%D5%B2%D5%A8/347510)\n\n![48363964_578448252596141_8972978531579461632_o|690x460](upload://upmkJTBuuO3Y2tiy6GzLBLAGfb4.jpeg) \n![48954495_586254625148837_3396633645765623808_o|690x459](upload://hcueV0HT1OdWp8rcT0S4rROmaYc.jpeg) \n\nThis year, ARTsakh Fest will take place on October 4-6. Unfortunately, the Karabakh administration did not have funds to support the festival as they did last year, they needed budget to host the alternative world football championship of unrecognized countries last June.\n\nThat is why @iriedawta and her team need your support to make this year's ARTsakh fest happen. The funds will be used for production materials, travel of artists from Yerevan and accommodation in Stepanakert.\n\nYou can support the festival [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/artsakhfest).", "created_at": "2019-09-07 05:08:03.234883", "updated_at": "2019-09-09 06:22:44.308886", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 599, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 1928.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 4, 3, 2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78050, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13751, "post_number": 1, "raw": "A while back, @marina, @matthias, @felix.wolfsteller and I had [an interesting discussion](/t/11905) on the possibility of using [Gource](https://gource.io) to visualize \"in one breath\" the (now)  over eight years of Edgeryders, closing in on 70,000 posts by 2,500 of the 6,000 registered users. The idea matured for a while, and then suddenly last week I made this: \n\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GLSqjwjia18\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nHere's what you are looking at:\n\n* The story of Edgeryders is compressed in under 3 minutes. Well, part of it: I am still missing all of the [Knowledge Collection](#knowledge) category. The visualization shows about 40,000 posts, two thirds of the total Edgeryders conversation. \n* Nodes in the network represents post. Each post is shown as a \"leaf\" of a \"tree\" that branches our from the top-level category, to the sub-category, to the topic. Posts that reply to no one in particular are shown as attached to the topic; a post that replies to another is shown as attached to the it. So, long sequences of replies are represented as long chains unraveling from the topic. \n* Color coding is like in this platform. So, for example, [Campfire](#campfire)  is shown in red. \n* Users are shown as avatars zooming around the conversation graph and adding posts to it. The action of adding is represented by them shooting a green beam on the part of the graph where they are creating the new post. \n\nI find it beautiful. Among other things, it is a powerful reminder of what can happens when you treat conversations as data. But what does it mean? \n\nIf I squint at the video, and I recall all these years of engaging with this online community, I can see a story that goes more or less like this:\n\n* **Late 2011**: Edgeryders is born mostly as a collective blog \u2013 Campfire is the first category to start developing. \n* **2012**: very soon, common initiatives start emerging from the interaction on the blog. They are moved on to [Workspaces](#workspaces) (in gray); for example, each community event becomes a workspace ( we used to call them *Living On The Edge*: [LOTE1](#workspaces:lote1), [LOTE2](#workspaces:lote2), all the way to [LOTE6](#workspaces:lote6)). Some of these nodes are orange, reflecting the early reflections, the color of the Edgeryders company workspaces: a company does not yet exist, but we are starting to think we should make one. The dark blue of the [Autarky Lab](#earthos:autarky) also appears, reflecting an aspiration to resilience and self-sufficiency.\n* **2013 and 2014**: the Edgeryders company is born. More workspaces arise, including the [unMonastery](#workspaces:unmonastery) and [Spot The Future](#workspaces:spot-the-future), the very first paid Edgeryders project (thank you @elami5 for the opportunity!). We also start to talk about research (the gray-green of the [Research Network](#research-network)), and to share advice for making small companies (the smaller orange-and-grey component of [OCI Lab](#ocilab)).\n* **2015**: we start to publish structured wikis as reference to our methods for [Collaboration](#docs:collaboration) (in green) with one another ; also, a [Culture Squad](#culture-squad) (purple) assembles and starts to interact. Projects continue in the workspaces. \n* **2016 and 2017**: these are the years of [OpenCare](#workspaces:opencare). You can see it flashing like crazy the Workspaces graph. \n*  **2018**: all the newer clusters strengthen, especially [EarthOS](#earthos) (dark blue), where the extant #autarky conversation sprouts two new projects: [The Reef](#earthos:the-reef) and the [Sci-Fi Economics Lab](#earthos:sci-fi-economics). Also the work on Collaboration becomes more structured, reflecting better collaboration practices in the core of the Edgeryders community and company. \n* **2019**: two new large projects come to life: [NGI Forward](#ioh), in turquoise, and [POPREBEL](#wellbeing), in light blue. The EarthOS cluster grows further,  as we launch new projects and revamp extant ones in the second part of the year.\n\nOk, so that's me, at 1.14 in the night after spending the day tweaking the code to make these videos. But what about you? This is, after all, your story, as well as my own. \n\nDo you see anything in the video that looks interesting and you would like explained? Do you have a different story to tell? \n\nShould we even use this language to tell the story of our community? I find it poetic, all these little Monopoly pawns moving around and creating a gigantic conversation graph... but maybe you will find it weird, or too abstract. \n\nI am grateful for any feedback.

Like if you would ask people to show you without words \"future\" and \"past\" - do we show it the same way everywhere?\nHow would you show it? In the West I am guessing most would point forward to indicate future, and backward to indicate past.\n\nApparently there is some research on this that had come across a group, cannot remember where, for whom it was the opposite. When asked why, the answer was that you can see the past, but not the future. Seen from here it looks like how society is wired follows the former. Walking into the future as though it were possible to see what lies ahead. \n\nSeen like that it's not odd how so many seem to be afraid of/unsettled by chaos. Especially in more affluent parts of the world - people freak out a lot faster about things than in places where life overall is a lot tougher, institutions barely functioning/functioning differently etc. \n\nAm currently compiling material for our first outward facing website to present what we do as an organisation. After spending significant time trying to aggregate and organise key materials a few things stand out.\n\nFirstly the chaos is very much part of what makes edgeryders so interesting.  It looks like what we have been doing is really running a kind of open distributed R&D lab with all kinds of experimental work happening in all kinds of directions. The poor man's equivalent to the kind that people working in Bell labs, IBM and universities had in the early days when they would be given a lot more creative freedom before processes and management culture constrained it. Have heard alot about this from an older generation of technologists. \n\nThe second is that in spite of the chaos there is a strange coherence in the work. It was fairly easy to find a structure if you think about it in terms of clusters and constellations of people who choose to stick around one another around some shared interest over time.\n\nFinally, the importance of memory. Yes, you can have all the structured documentation of information that you want. But in a living system it takes human mind to filter stories - to know which stories offer valuable wisdom  in different contexts for different people. But much like the elders who are the keepers of the collective memory of a tribe, we need our own elders to be able to see what to pack for future journeys.", "created_at": "2020-05-10 06:37:14.649642", "updated_at": "2020-05-10 06:39:22.811731", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 440, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 88.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [428, 3, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 43362, "user_id": 4428, "topic_id": 8374, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Sure!

Definitely opened my eyes about few things.\n\nRegarding the paradox of EU laws not implemented properly and lack of cohesion at EU level, I just had a really funny experience:\nI am building a project in Croatia, and I wanted to speed things up. So I first checked with the bank of my Croatian company, if I can get a loan for constructing some houses etc. They said no as all my current revenue is on my Belgian accounts (I also have a company in Belgium and I am a freelancer since some time).\nThen I checked if I can do it with my Belgian banks, as my revenue is here. Well they said it's impossible as the project is in Croatia.\nIt was so confusing, as both countries are in EU and I couldn't understand the issue. Considering it's a construction investment, basically just finishing construction will bring the value of the property to double of the loan I was asking...I considered that very safe.\n\nThey explained to me that there are systems in place but just in theory, that they don't work properly.\n\nAlso if you look at it logically, if I really wanted to cheat in some way, I certainly wouldn't run from Belgium to Croatia or vice versa. I would go to Dominican Republic, or Thailand...something that actually makes sense.\n\nThe part about innovation and responsibility with special focus on IT sector also struck the cord within me. I wrote about it [here](https://medium.com/the-innovation/entrepreneurship-and-innovation-our-responsibility-34dbed989379) as well. \nWe really need to take a good, hard look at technology. It has grown so much in such a short time that nobody really adapted or figured out what the  consequences really are. For me IT is a huge potential but we aren't using it properly yet.\n\nVery interesting examples of AI used, if you don't mind I will quote you few times in my new article :slight_smile: \nI am writing now on the subject of AI use specifically and the dangers of seeing algorithms as best solutions for everything. What really triggered my response was seeing more and more news about using AI in most improbable ways. Like using it to solve the Japanese issue of having way too few children being born and more and more single adults just not being able to find or keep a partner. It is a deeply human issue. It requires very critical look into various aspects of socioeconomic conditions in Japan...I highly doubt using AI is the best solution to reduce the numbers of humans drifting away from their humanity.", "created_at": "2020-12-16 17:47:50.911982", "updated_at": "2020-12-16 17:47:50.911982", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 452, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 36.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58893, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 8130, "post_number": 14, "raw": "yeah would be good to have the documentary show bigger as well @matthias :pray:", "created_at": "2019-09-07 06:03:20.398491", "updated_at": "2019-09-07 06:03:20.398491", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 27.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58892], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62603, "user_id": 5522, "topic_id": 11318, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Zaczn\u0119 od tego, \u017ce jestem bardzo uprzywilejowanym cz\u0142owiekiem w naszym spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwie: bia\u0142ym m\u0119\u017cczyzn\u0105 w \u015brednim wieku, wychowanym w katolickiej rodzinie, heteroseksualnym, mieszkaj\u0105cym w jednym z 5 najwi\u0119kszych miast, z wy\u017cszym wykszta\u0142ceniem, dochodami, kt\u00f3re pozwalaj\u0105 zabra\u0107 rodzin\u0119 na wakacje.

Tym razem jest to szko\u0142a mojego dziecka. W pierwszym miesi\u0105cu m\u0142ody otrzyma\u0142 7 czy 8 ocen (nie wa\u017cne jakich). Niekt\u00f3re 6 i 7 latki wpada\u0142y w histeri\u0119 otrzymuj\u0105c 5 i 6 -. Posypa\u0142y si\u0119 oceny, cho\u0107 nikt nigdy nie wyja\u015bni\u0142 dzieciom po co one s\u0105. Jaka ocena jest za co. Czego si\u0119 od nich oczekuje. Pomijam ca\u0142\u0105 dyskusj\u0119 na temat tego, czy oceny faktycznie s\u0142u\u017c\u0105 rozwojowi dziecka. Nie\u015bmia\u0142e pr\u00f3by nawi\u0105zania rozmowy z nauczycielem na temat ocen zako\u0144czy\u0142y si\u0119 informacj\u0105, \u017ce od nauczyciela ocen wymaga dyrekcja, od dyrekcji kuratorium itd. I tyle.\n\nJedna z moich bardzo bliskich os\u00f3b w wieku wczesna-emerytalnym pewnego dnia nie podnios\u0142a si\u0119 z \u0142\u00f3\u017cka. Niedow\u0142ad lewej strony cia\u0142a. Dramat. Nagle wszystkie potrzeby trzeba za\u0142atwi\u0107 w \u0142\u00f3\u017cku, a jeszcze kilka lat temu ch\u0142op by\u0142 jak tur. Wizyty u lekarzy. Wizyty na SOR (\u017ceby unikn\u0105\u0107 kolejek). Sprzeczne diagnozy. Ka\u017cdy m\u00f3wi co innego. Odsy\u0142a gdzie indziej. Nikt ne bierze odpowiedzialno\u015bci. Dni mijaj\u0105. Miesi\u0105ce mijaj\u0105. Ca\u0142a opieka 24godzinna jest na barkach rodziny. W ko\u0144cu okazuje si\u0119 \u017ce to mo\u017ce jednak powik\u0142anie po dawnej operacji kr\u0119gos\u0142upa. Miesi\u0105ce oczekiwania na nowy zabieg. Niemo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 dostania si\u0119 na rehabilitacj\u0119. A ka\u017cdy dzie\u0144 to wi\u0119ksze zaniki mi\u0119\u015bni, wi\u0119ksze ryzyko odle\u017cyn, droga z kt\u00f3rej co raz trudniej zawr\u00f3ci\u0107.

Ca\u0142e szcz\u0119\u015bcie \u017ce facet przepracowa\u0142 40 lat na etacie na stanowiskach kierowniczych i jego emerytura + oszcz\u0119dno\u015bci starczy na zap\u0142acenie tej opieki przez jakie\u015b 6-7 miesi\u0119cy.\n\nPoniewa\u017c nie mam samochodu, cz\u0119sto chodz\u0119 po mie\u015bcie piechot\u0105. Do niedawna z w\u00f3zkiem dzieci\u0119cym. Teraz sam lub z 4 osobow\u0105 rodzin\u0105. Mijam te wszystkie auta zaparkowane na chodnikach, przystankach, tu\u017c przed pasami, na \u015bcie\u017ckach rowerowych. Schodz\u0119 czasami na ulic\u0119, bo chodnikiem nie da si\u0119 i\u015b\u0107. Jak ju\u017c naprawd\u0119 kto\u015b przesadzi\u0142 z tym parkowaniem, a ja mam poryw obywatelskiego obowi\u0105zku to dzwoni\u0119 na stra\u017c miejsk\u0105. Przyje\u017cd\u017caj\u0105 zazwyczaj 6 -7 godzin p\u00f3\u017aniej i albo nie robi\u0105 nic bo samoch\u00f3d odjecha\u0142, albo wlepiaj\u0105 mandat zupe\u0142nie innemu kierowcy ni\u017c ten kt\u00f3ry mi utrudnia\u0142 przej\u015bcie. S\u0142ysze p\u00f3\u017aniej od znajomych i s\u0105siad\u00f3w, kt\u00f3rzy p\u0142aca mandaty lub odbieraj\u0105 odholowane samochody \u017ce na policj\u0119 i stra\u017c dzwoni\u0105 jacy\u015b konfidenci. Raz poszed\u0142em na spotkanie do lokalnego samorz\u0105dowca by porozmawia\u0107 o parkowaniu w mie\u015bcie. Us\u0142ysza\u0142em, \u017ce nic nie zrobi bo zawsze znajdzie si\u0119 kto\u015b niezadowolony. Jak chc\u0119 co\u015b zaproponowa\u0107, to mam zrobi\u0107 konsultacj\u0119 w ca\u0142ej dzielnicy, doprowadzi\u0107 do porozumienia i przyj\u015b\u0107 do niego z rozwi\u0105zaniem. No nie zrobi\u0142em.\n\nKiedy\u015b w gronie znajomych zacz\u0119li\u015bmy si\u0119 zastanawia\u0107 po czym wiadomo, \u017ce kto\u015b jest ju\u017c \u201edoros\u0142y\u201d. Jak g\u0142\u0119biej przeanalizowali\u015bmy swoj\u0105 sytuacje i sytuacj\u0119 \u017cyciowa znajomych, to doszli\u015bmy do wniosku, \u017ce jednoznacznym znakiem \u017ce jeste\u015b doros\u0142y lub doros\u0142a jest to \u017ce masz spraw\u0119 w s\u0105dzie. Rozwodow\u0105, spadkow\u0105, biznesow\u0105, frankow\u0105, ubezpieczeniow\u0105 jak\u0105kolwiek. W najlepszym wypadku jeste\u015b \u015bwiadkiem w sprawie znajomych. Wi\u0119c ja te\u017c bywam w s\u0105dzie. Sprawa toczy si\u0119 od roku. I s\u0105d od 4 miesi\u0119cy nie jest w stanie powiedzie\u0107, kiedy b\u0119dzie kolejna rozprawa, ani kiedy b\u0119dzie w stania zako\u0144czy\u0107 ca\u0142e post\u0119powanie. Mam komfort czekania.\n\nI nie zrozumcie mnie \u017ale. Ja nie potrzebuje narzeka\u0107. Mam naprawd\u0119 wyj\u0105tkowo dobrze. Jest kasa na taks\u00f3wki. Jak potrzebuj\u0119 to id\u0119 do lekarza prywatnie. Najbli\u017csi, kt\u00f3rzy potrzebuj\u0105 opieki s\u0105 w stanie sami j\u0105 sfinansowa\u0107. Nawet w pracy nikt mnie nie ci\u015bnie.\n\nZastanawiam si\u0119 tylko czasami jak sobie radz\u0105 osoby, kt\u00f3re nie maj\u0105 tyle szcz\u0119\u015bcia co ja. I zaczynam wtedy rozumie\u0107, \u017ce cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 z nas potrzebuje je\u017adzi\u0107 starymi dilami, zatrudnia\u0107 na czarno opiekunki z Ukrainy, pracowa\u0107 na dwa etaty na umowach \u015bmieciowych i leczy\u0107 si\u0119 lekami z reklamy. I rozumiem dlaczego wolimy dosta\u0107 tu i teraz 500+ lub 13 emerytur\u0119 za cen\u0119 przymykania oczu na szwindle w\u0142adzy i szczucie na innych: obcych, nieheteroseksualnych, lewych. Nawet ja mam poczucie \u017cycia w ci\u0105g\u0142ej niepewno\u015bci i braku zaufania: czy lekarz umie leczy\u0107 i czy mu si\u0119 zachce, czy poci\u0105g przyjedzie na czas, czy mnie kto\u015b na ulicy nie zwyzywa, czy nauczyciel w szkole swoimi nie\u015bwiadomymi komentarzami i dzia\u0142aniami traumatyzuje moje dziecko itd., itd. I zaczynam rozumie\u0107, \u017ce cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 z nas ma wywalone na wybory, podatki, jako\u015b\u0107 edukacji, s\u0142u\u017cby zdrowia, opieki i transportu.

We also welcomed  **Luk** co-founder of [Woon Coop]((https://www.wooncoop.be/)). A cooperative that developed a mixed model between rental and ownership active in Belgium. \n\n\n![Photos%20banner|690x85](upload://fu2C9XSbVNuBO6b3PFbwOm2hJa9.jpeg) \n\nI am deeply thankful to everyone who attended this workshop. \nI am also thankful for everyone who feels a sense of belonging for the Reef community whether you had a chance to attend a workshop or not.\n**This post is an open door to put perspective on the concrete ideas we expressed !**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n @noemi facilitated us the way to collectively shape the Reef onto 3 main areas :\n\n\n*  **Living Together**\n*  **Green behaviors**\n* **Governance**\n\n\n\nFeel free to endorse or not, comment, spread knowledge and references. ***Sharing is caring* !**\n\nLiving together\n--\n\n![living%20together|690x388](upload://zKwfK8AyPIOPpteOpDnHlqbcQbg.jpeg) \n\nFrom the Kitchen, to sewery courses, to knowledge sharing and time-banking, the codesign sprint was a fruitful discussion to draw a qualitative map of all the collective habits that could be endorsed in the Reef.\n\n**Things we agreed on** \nThe Reef would be **modulable** to get space for **privacy, intimacy, and common areas**. Yet, this requirement for modularity doesn\u2019t tell if the building has to be vertical or made with separate buildings. **Accessibility** for everyone is a common criteria. Here we consider both people with disabilities, temporary guests, diversity of households typologies, background, experiences, skills and potentialities to expand.\n\nThe Reef would create a space for a third party that we define by now as a facilitator or a mediator. This person would be **someone standing on the first line and trustworthy.**\n\nGreen behaviors \n--\n\n![green%20living|591x690](upload://eFGdJiui3FZ3V4mskLkiuaJzrDE.jpeg) \n\n**1. Shared green behaviors**\n\nEverythings starts with the **skills and passion we got** in the first place. If you practise yoga, then let\u2019s practise yoga in a common area and present this practise to others inhabitants and users of the place :)\n\nGreen is also about being **savvy**. Kitchen issues offers a room to create modular initiative (open kitchen some days, collective cooking, r\u00e9cup, table d\u2019h\u00f4te, workshops\u2026).\n\n**2. Time is community**\n\n> How could possibly The Reef offer more emphasis on the time and skills people offer to the community ?\n\nInitatives such as **time-banking** have been raised as relevant examples. \nYou can get an explanation here on the website of [les grands voisins](https://lesgrandsvoisins.org/les-lieux-ouverts/une-monnaie-locale-pour-favoriser-les-echanges-et-une-boutique-sans-argent-le-trocshop/) in Paris. Basically they created a trocshop, you pay workers and clothes with either time for the community and/or metro ticket.\n\n\n**3. The Reef as a vehicle for Decarbonization**\n\n\n> How could The Reef possibly be self-sufficient energetically wise ?\n\nTo go deeper on that topic, @matthias initiated an [inventory of technical solution](https://edgeryders.eu/t/notable-points-from-the-green-building-tech-workshop/11826) for The Reef and beyond. \n\n# Governance\n\nMatthew who just released the 1st edition of the more than edgy [coliving insights](https://www.colivinginsights.com/) and @alberto talked about governance structure for the Reef. \n[Alberto compiled all this in-depth](https://edgeryders.eu/t/co-living-co-housing-and-first-thoughts-of-the-wooncoop-model/12016) discussion in a topic on edgeryders. \n\n![governance|690x388](upload://sp98HeZ8KKbIrT7H6sV4RyrD69y.jpeg) \n\n**Just to sum up and get clear ideas**\n\n**coliving** concerns primarily businesses providing branded multi-party residential\nproducts with a service layer. Most of coliving experiences are focused on commercial and rental model that have the opportunity to make a market impact and reach a large number of people.\n\nAre **Not** concerned by this definition : student accommodation and, with some exceptions, intentional communities and co-operatives which are typically driven by owner-occupiers without a profit motive.\n\n* **PROS**\npeople rent the space from the operator, and they tend to get an inclusive service to run the rent, utilities, maintenance, cleaning, laundry\n\n* **CONS**\nwhen the service is too perfect then the level of convenience is high and the necessity of community building is weakened\n\n**cohousing** : People buy a living unit which is part of a larger context; sometimes they even develop it together\n\n* **PROS**\nstrong community spirit\n\n* **CONS**\neasy to cash in but difficult to cash out if needed\n\n![wooncoop|690x161](upload://rea4MexYSYwgEIQN90h04xtIUuZ.png) \n\n**What to keep in mind ?** \n* The Reef governance model might **draw its own line** between coliving qualitative living and co-operative ownerships \n* To prevent negative aspects of both coliving and cohousing The Reef governance model should **prevent high turnover rate** (like in traditionnal coliving) and **investors insecurities** (like in cohousing)\n* Some of the **Reef convenience would be DIY** and community based\n* A broader perspective on cooperative models allows to make a difference between  **investing bodies** and  **effective inhabitants and users of The Reef**\n\n\n\nThe Reef community thanks [Metrolab Brussels](http://www.metrolab.brussels/) for kindly hosting us in their wonderful offices.\n\n\n--\n![metrolab|690x226](upload://dvnOOj8QikCoNrW9PofBav14knq.png) \n\nEdgeryders inputs on the Reef\n-\n* @Noemi https://edgeryders.eu/t/notable-points-from-workshop-3-codesign-sprint/11993/10\n* @Alberto  https://edgeryders.eu/t/co-living-co-housing-and-first-thoughts-of-the-wooncoop-model/12016\n* @matthias https://edgeryders.eu/t/notable-points-from-the-green-building-tech-workshop/11826/3\n\n*This activity is supported by*\n\n![EIT-Climate-KIC-EU-flag-transparent|690x254](upload://rRCxtfLkIeCHIkDyp0JVHNeLan7.png)", "created_at": "2019-12-06 01:06:07.306555", "updated_at": "2020-01-15 16:07:07.737700", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 949, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 118.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 5, 5538], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56773, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10188, "post_number": 65, "raw": "We all like it!

We do workshops with our manual (nr. 2), providing us with some income, while there are passionate people still contributing (nr. 1) and some of paid educational work involves also producing new knowledge (nr. 3).\n\nOne thing I am investigating with the BioFab Forum, is to consider it as a commons shared between education professionals. In grants that we are filing for now, we have \"online guidance\" budgeted into them. Community organizing scales well, so having multiple people using it professionally as a P2P learning platform lowers the cost for everyone.

These ideas were discussed at LOTE3, and followed up with many discussions, but so far not an explicit part of the call for participation or unMonastery-in-a-box.

Eg China does not accept the return of Chinese citizens who have applied for asylum elsewhere. Hence people are stuck. \nTHey don't exist administratively, so on paper, on policy -level they aren't dealt with. But of course they exist, they are here, in the city. So usually it's cities and mayors who deal with the issue, because they know if they don't, that people will be homeless, and that will cause unrest. \nSo cities in the Netherlands formulate their own policies on how the deal with these people. Amsterdam is quite a left-leaning city, but they offer very little support. It's just enough for people to survive, but not to be able to live. Other Dutch cities offer more support. There is also the argument of pull-factors: cities are afraid that if they offer more, more undocumented people will move there. \nThe public, well, left-leaning people like me feel the city should do more, right-leaning people think that this group of people shouldn't be here, hence they don't have a right to anything.", "created_at": "2018-02-13 17:14:53.884915", "updated_at": "2018-02-13 17:14:53.884915", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 236, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 8.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [41763], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59639, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10813, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Sounds great, good luck, girls!

However, the OST does not offer the solution to document the informal, in-between-sessions proceedings. Hence the community journalists would be a great option. But then again, there should be a decision on what data do we want to collect? If a journalist reports some meeting, group discussion - we get her/his interpretation of what was happening. And it is enough for a curious\u00a0 outsider or for anyone who was involved in another conversation/discussion etc. But for qualitative research purposes the raw information (a basic transcript) is more useful: it is richer primary data, that can be used not only for content, but also for deeper discourse analysis. On the other hand, it is less interesting for those, who want just a few bullet points to summarize everything.\n\nMy suggestion would be to have a few people, who will do transcripts as well as summaries of discussions. For privacy purposes the names/surnames/nicknames/anything that can identify a person should be withheld from the published transcript (unless the people agree with it), but some sociological data could be available for the researchers upon request (only for statistical/descriptive purposes). And then the transcript can be summarized in a few bullet points for more general use. It just seem like a double work, but for example, when I need to write an article, I transcribe interviews at first, and then work the raw text into a nice story. So in this case, no story, just a short summary and/or bullet points would not be a big burden.\n\nAnother thought:\n\ndiaries are common tools of ethnographers. You record not only your interviews, but also personal observations, various events, emotions etc. Of course, conferences do not last for months, but I guess it would be great to have more in-depth feedback from short diaries from some of the participants, who would agree to write down what they saw, experienced, felt etc. each day in the evening, and then later submitted it to the community. How is it different from writing down after each session? Well, it takes less time, it captures the main moments of the day, and still is a more detailed feedback than just the one in the end of the conference. And I suppose the privacy issues can\u00a0 be worked out here as well.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-07 21:07:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:35.011470", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 435, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75920, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13309, "post_number": 49, "raw": "will add you @darkturo :)", "created_at": "2020-05-07 07:45:46.826162", "updated_at": "2020-05-07 07:45:46.826162", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 23.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [75909], "is_liked_by": [6279], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47413, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 9013, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Understandable.

It's called <a href=\"http://hackingutopia.cre8tives.org/about/\">Hacking Utopia- \\#OpenCare for social and demographic change</a>\u00a0and was born out of our shared experiences as designers. More specifically the frustration with outdated design education that ill prepares students to be able to do meaningful work with their skills and talents. We feel that this should start already during their education so by the time they have graduated they are already up and running their own exciting projects that really contribute towards tackling some of the bigger challenges which affect us all. \u00a0After a lot of work over the past couple of months, especially by Susa, the partnership agreement between Edgeryders and UDK was finalised and today we launched the first ever edition of this new course format.\n\nOver the next six months each student will be working on design research and product development process that departs from the OpenCare topic and methodologies..and they will be doing it in synch with the phases of the larger OpenCare research project. The course participants' documentation and individual reflections from each day are uploaded in the Op3nCare Community Homebase where you are very welcome to leave comments helping them develop their thinking and projects.\n\nWhy do this? You get to see the OpenCare topic and challenges from many different perspectives and help shape the students research and product development work so they really are contributing to the Opencare research project. For the students getting feedback from you is an unparalleled way to discover new\u00a0knowledge and broaden their horisons about what is happening in the fields relevant to all our work.\n\nReflections from day 1 are slowly being posted here:\u00a0<a href=\"/en/share-your-reflections-from-day-1-of-the-hacking-utopia-opencare-lab\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/share-your-reflections-from-day-1-of-the-hacking-utopia-opencare-lab</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>Image credit: Susanne Stauch, OpenCare Lab \\#1 - Hacking Utopia</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-04 21:59:06", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 08:25:00.341709", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 411, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77436, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13596, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Thank you for the clarification", "created_at": "2020-05-26 12:58:08.853767", "updated_at": "2020-05-26 12:58:08.853767", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [77432], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72153, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12879, "post_number": 55, "raw": "It the whole team hosting this and opening up working together :)", "created_at": "2020-03-23 10:26:10.713697", "updated_at": "2020-03-23 10:26:10.713697", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 26.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [72151], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76155, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13466, "post_number": 12, "raw": "\n\nI also have a shorter version but without concrete connection to his book.

I only read the conceptual part, as the more technical stuff is probably irrelevant to us. I feel the comments made by @markomanka in our call apply completely: \"semantic networks\" are used in this literature in kind of the same way as \"the semantic web\".  By recommending it, I think reviever 4 wants us to say something like this: \n\n> SSNs as described in this paper differ from semantic networks described in computer science literature (later to evolve into the concept of the semantic web [https://www.w3.org/TR/PR-rdf-syntax/]) in several ways. First, SSNs are meant for human consumption, and not as a system for computers to efficiently store and retrieve information. Second, and as a consequence, they are underpinned by a simple ontology, that can easily fit in human short term memory. Our chosen representation has only two types of nodes, participants to the conversation and ethnographic codes, and only three types of edges, comments (participant-to-participant), references (participant-to-code), co-occurs-with (code-to-code). By contrast, graph databases (proposed as early as 1971 [Shapiro, 1971]) can and do encode many types of relationships \n\nDoes this work?", "created_at": "2018-09-27 10:17:14.642619", "updated_at": "2018-09-27 10:17:14.642619", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 239, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 62.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14143, "user_id": 3340, "topic_id": 772, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Research on botanical, and biogas &amp; ecological energy </b>\n\nHi @Noemi, nice to hear from you that hope send it right back to you. :)\n\nThat's right, I have a former colleague a botanist for being exact when I was working in the raining forest on the East of Madagascar whose work with a Professor called Daniel RAMAMPIERIKA.

One of the aspects is introducing different forms of internal and external reciprocity and a **new financial and accounting system based on valueflow**. We did not dig the part of alternative currencies deeper yet, cuz our small group does not have the expertise in all fields. Actually it is a tactical project which could turn big. We are entending to **build a collaborative Social Enterprise** with a focus on the fairtrade of organic and natural products in developing countries. The peculiarity of our efforts is that we \"started\" building an end-to-end software, where economic activities are mapped as a P2B, B2B, P2P network of value flow processes. The main developers are ValueFlo.ws (maker of NRP and Holo REA) and [Communecter.org](http://Communecter.org). Our intention is to build an open-source software solution so that many people in many countries will use it one day and connect their economic networks of value flow into a new global economic structure as [CTZNMUV.org](http://CTZNMUV.org). It should also work as a hybrid post-money framework (**value-fairtrade**). We work since 2 months without funds but with full commitment.    We managed to write this summary out of the many threads and discussions \n[Open Olive Summery](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iYsuzkiaBEOUZEJcudd6E8CHwE7ZwgWeHp1SarpJ84o/edit)    \n\nI think it could gain traction with support of some Edgeryders, I would love to reach out new co-actors and build new links to the project.

Get help from the community in return.\n\nA new collective structure for moneyless financing of green social ventures: \u201cVenture Social Capital.\u201d\n\nThose segments of the population with limited access to wealth and / or credit have a much harder time founding a successful business than those with access to these. This is especially limiting for an economy if these people have innovative ideas and the motivation and energy to make them happen.\n\nThe idea is to \u201cfinance\u201d new positive, local projects using the collective power of dense social networks, with a commitment-based social structure to give them the ability to make decisions in a timely and business-like manner, a step by step virtual incubation process to structure distributed collaboration towards tangible results and a network bartering technology that calculates multilateral barter trades where every participant receives credits they want in exchange for credit they issue. Edgeryders already has developed prototypes of all three components and can run a medium scale collaboration experiment of the Venture Social Capital for green social enterprises by the end of 2020.\n\nWe require additional funding to pay for some final touches in the UX and interface design, production of communication materials, sales work and legal consulting fees. We also need a small fund to finance cash prizes for the first distributed teams that succeed in producing tangible results for either going from ideas to deployment of new social green ventures or tackling key challenges for strengthening existing social green ventures. This will speed up adoption during the pilot phase.\n\nMarket pathway:\n\n1) We build strategic partnerships with co-working spaces which now have to diversify or pivot business models towards online/digital services. We offer them a package of services which they can sell to members, generating revenue for them and financing the operations of our solution. This is sped up through a virtual summit on recovery of the co-working sector which gathers leading lights from the coworking community globally to co-create solutions in response to the Covid-19 crisis. The number of coworking spaces in Europe before the crisis was estimated at circa 14,000 with circa 35,000 flexible work desks with an estimated member base of 2.6 - 3.8 million by 2020. It was estimated to grow to 5.1 million by 2022 prior to the pandemic crisis. Each coworking space has an extended network reach larger than the number of paying members. If we assume it\u2019s only double the size of their paying membership base that amounts to 5.2 - 7.6 million.\n\n2) Next we will sell this solution to mid and large sized companies that want to scale their capacity to quickly access new markets by outsourcing their product and service ideation and deployment for green solutions to global networks of talented people who are underemployed due to the crisis. We will streamline our operations into a simple platform for companies to hire anyone, anywhere by bridging localized compliance and payments whilst automating it all \u2013 making a complex and manual process seamless. Single payroll platform for distributed global team.\n\nAbility to deploy within the next 12-18 months.\n\nWe already have built working prototypes of the three necessary components for our solution to work. We have an already existing dense network in place through the Edgeryders global community platform (5000 members in over 80 countries). The virtual incubation process for distributed collaboration on service and product development for green ventures we built and tested in the MENA region in 2019 in partnership with the World Bank. The multilateral bartering technology also already has been built by our CTO and has been spun off into a new venture called PayCoupons. What we need now is capital to finance the final touches in terms of business development and user experience design, producing high quality communication materials, and deploying an intense sales campaign which includes organising an online marketing campaign of the virtual summit for supporting the recovery of the coworking sector. All of these activities are already underway, an injection of capital would enable us to speed things up to get our solution to market and secure our first clients by the end of the year.\n\n## Why this, why now.\n\nHow we have been organizing resources and markets so humans have food on the table and a roof over their head has proven to be fragile in the midst of a pandemic. Most complex challenges (like getting food on the table for your family from a hundred sources and locations), are not one well-defined problem (grow apples), but a constellation of interdependent issues (transportation logistics, factory sorting and processing, demand & supply negotiations, regulation etc) undergoing constant redefinition and renegotiation. Any one organisation, no matter how efficient and smart, has no hope of containing it.\n\n![|167x248](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XySV6GH10g9P_3iNGBcjBFCBEAcYoGiS-Zqib3NNubWSgRg5N_T3xE6knMHWH5QpuY9IziHTR3UpnCLZO2W0DjLSzL5JygFb_8JXsL2NlUJttv8lYmoCv2QB9qATgofFHdHS3kfw)\n\nAt the same time we see that in the face of large shocks to the system, organisations optimised for efficiency and profit cannot provide the means for material, relational, and existential resilience of neither individual nor society at large. Case in point: When supply chains are broken, even benevolent governments in affluent countries cannot access the equipment or protective gear to protect frontline workers on which we all depend to stay alive.\n\nOn the other hand, communities are getting smarter. The Internet has produced decentralized, scalable tools for coordination, archiving, and retrieval. It has also spawned cultural practices and ethical rules that incentivize people to collaborate with strangers. As a result, leaderless \"swarms\" of dedicated citizen experts are writing encyclopedias, mapping the Earth, doing science, developing and maintaining complex, successful software stacks. In each of these areas they outperform powerful businesses and government initiatives. These initiatives display uncanny speed and efficiency, because communities are better than organizational hierarchies at making use of human intelligence. They treat every person \u2013 not just the top echelon \u2013 as a potential or actual expert, rather than as a passive consumer or beneficiary. They ask people to help, rather than charting their needs, and they have more human talent to throw at problems. They weed out under-performing initiatives in a healthy and natural way, making way for new life to emerge.\n\nWikipedia\u2019s a good example of the combined power of Smart Swarms to change the world. We all use it every day, and it\u2019s taking effective action on both poverty (poor people are using it too, all over the world!) and ecology (it\u2019s saving huge numbers of trees on paper books.) People are working together to solve a real human problem - access to knowledge - and it\u2019s improving everyone\u2019s lives. There\u2019s a tiny thread of financial capital \u2013 running the servers, say \u2013 but Wikipedia is a community-driven enterprise. It shows what can be done.\n\nWe want to achieve resilient lives and livelihoods. Contributing to Wikipedia doesn\u2019t put food on the table or ensure that communities support one another to mitigate the consequences of social distancing. Or even keep our mental health intact when automation wipes out the need for many professions, the foundation on which many of us build our identity and sense of purpose. We need to use a similar kind of effect to meet the material, relational, and existential needs of individuals and communities. And we need to develop sources of prosperity that secure their resilience by serving these needs.\n\nThis is not just semantics: it is about reframing entrepreneurship from a lonely, competitive activity that only is accessible if you have money to sustain yourself while you build your business or have specialised training to one that is collaborative, mutualistic, and accessible to all, regardless of your personal background. We frame the building of impactful and sustainable business activity as that of building an ecosystem, made up of many overlapping circles of people engaging in different activities. Business always relied on cooperation more than competition (but that was called an old boys club).\n\nWe are developing a series of pilots and events aimed at co-designing experimental new business and investment models which together sketch out a new path for entrepreneurship. One that can withstand the shocks which will be soon be upon us as climate crisis and ecological devastation accelerate.\n\n## Our tactics and technologies\n\nEcosystems are not designed: they evolve. We focus on accelerating the evolution of the ecosystem of community-provided social innovations and social businesses. We:\n\n* Start with \"viable mutants\". We identify suitable initiatives that have achieved tangible initial progress. Many are already known to us through our extended networks.\n* Provide conditions for expansion. We fund a scaled-up deployment of each initiative.\n* Speed up the rates of adaptation. We push initiatives out in the field early, encouraging prototyping and rapid learning. Knowledge sharing practices borrowed from open source hackers enable initiatives to imitate each other's tactics, further speeding up adaptation.\n* Promote niche discovery and colonization. Knowledge sharing institutions are a natural venue for initiatives to trade with each other. This promotes specialization into emerging niches in the ecosystem and enriches it.\n* Enforce natural selection. Initiatives that fail to complete any step of the process are dropped. Initiatives are encouraged and supported to become self-supporting by the end of the process.\n* The technology that supports this evolution is the Edgeryders stack: an online platform, community management and open source digital tools to enable meaningful dialogue and distributed collaboration at scale. In addition, we use the PayCoupons platform to enable service exchange between entrepreneurs and co-working members as a non-monetary mode of collaboration.\n* Finally we document and disseminate the results widely, seeking to challenge the prevailing narrative of how successful business ventures and ecosystems are born and sustained.\n\n## Why Edgeryders is well positioned for doing this work\n\nOur solution builds on existing working prototypes that we have built ourselves for the components needed for our solution to be rapidly piloted. We can get a medium scale collaboration experiment of the Venture Social Capital for green social enterprises up and running by the end of 2020. The multilateral bartering technology has already has been built by our CTO and won the European Social Innovation Prize in 2015. In 2019 we designed and tested the prototype of a virtual incubation process for distributed collaboration on service and product development for green ventures. In partnership with the World Bank, we ran a well-evaluated test deployment in the MENA region. And we already have a large enough pilot group of 5000 people in over 80 countries through the Edgeryders global community online platform. The community is already active (high throughput) and the range of skills, offers and demands is diverse enough to cover the needs of a broad range of green ventures. What we need now is capital to finance business development and user experience design, producing high quality communication materials, and deploying an intense sales campaign which includes organising an online marketing campaign of the virtual summit for supporting the recovery of the coworking sector. These activities are already underway. An injection of capital would enable us to speed things up to get our solution to market and secure our first clients by the end of the year. We have all the necessary skills in house. Also, from experience we know that online solutions do need to be combined with excellent community management and offline local presence to really take off. Our team has significant experience in this.This is reflected in the composition of our leadership, teams and our community members. We have a track record of organising events and activities that succeed in engaging different parts of society: the arts, government, academia, industry and civil society.\n\n## Sustainability Strategy\n\nOur unique value proposition/differentiator and revenue generation mechanism is to offer small, medium and large companies a Single payroll platform for distributed global team. We will build it in two phases.\n\nFirst we establish a distribution vehicle. We are already building strategic partnerships with co-working spaces which now have to diversify or pivot business models towards online/digital services. We offer them a package of services which they can sell to members, generating revenue for them and financing the operations of our solution. This is sped up through a virtual summit on recovery of the co-working sector which gathers leading lights from the coworking community globally to co-create solutions in response to the Covid-19 crisis. The event will bring together The number of coworking spaces in Europe before the crisis was estimated at circa 14,000 with circa 35,000 flexible work desks with an estimated member base of 2.6 - 3.8 million by 2020. It was estimated to grow to 5.1 million by 2022 prior to the pandemic crisis. Each coworking space has an extended network reach larger than the number of paying members. If we assume it\u2019s only double the size of their paying membership base that amounts to 5.2 - 7.6 million.\n\nNext we will sell this solution to mid and large sized companies that want to scale their capacity to quickly access and adapt to new markets for green products and services. We enable them outsource their product and service ideation and deployment for green solutions to global networks of talented people who are underemployed due to the crisis. We will streamline our operations into a simple platform for companies to hire anyone, anywhere by bridging localized compliance and payments whilst automating it all \u2013 making a complex and manual process seamless for both.\n\n## COVID-19 Impact,\n\nOur solution is a new vehicle for financing the Green Deal as the path to recovery, regenerationand resilience in the aftermath of Covid19. It is a hybrid banking solution for unlocking and democratising access to capital for green social ventures.\n\nSome work has already been done moneyless and hybrid circular banking solutions for transactions on a non-monetary basis with promising results. They have faced limitations on two fronts. Most have occurred on too small a scale for the circle to close. Also, they tended to be restricted to participation at the local level, ie have access to a limited pool of talent. Our solution contributes key additional elements to enable this to operate at a much larger scale both in terms of size, as well as geographic coverage. The components of our solution have already been prototyped and validated by third parties e.g evaluators at the World Bank and European Commission. Through our global and diverse online community of 5000 members in more than 80 countries and our significant experience in building both long lasting online and offline communities, we can quickly access and engage a large enough pilot group with whom to work. Our solution also has a credible path to revenue generation and profitability. Finally, by enabling simple solutions for organisations to hire anyone, anywhere through a single payroll platform that makes it easy for anyone to hire anyone else, anywhere while still being compliant - we unlock access to a global labour markets for people currently underemployed and also unlock their capacity to create new jobs generated from the new new green ventures.", "created_at": "2020-06-22 09:56:07.719882", "updated_at": "2020-06-22 09:56:07.719882", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2632, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 1.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [79304], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82371, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 14185, "post_number": 20, "raw": "[quote=\"amelia, post:19, topic:14185\"]\nUsing the new \u201ctree\u201d display for speed, go through and make all non-proper nouns lowercase.

The AWE technology does not use a tower but tethered flying systems (like kites or gliders).\n\nIt's important that the potential of AWE doesn't remain in the hands of few companies like it is in the case of fossil fuel energy sources.

One way not to overproliferate codes is to make sure that a code is only applied if the community member uses the concept *meaningfully* .\n\nFor example, if an event takes place in the United States, but the activities that happened at the event are not meaningfully connected to the fact that the event took place in the United States, in your interpretive assessment, do not apply that code. If, however, the fact that a certain activity happened in Prague (a major city) rather than a rural area, apply the code `Prague ` . Use SSNA thinking here: a co-occurrence network around cities might differ substantially to one around a rural area (certain ideas might be more widely held and repeated in the capital city than in a rural town, for example), which we would want to capture in the SSNA. Code with intention and interpretively.\n\nAs another example, a community member might mention that they are 50 years old. You would only apply the code `age ` if age was a meaningful frame used by the community member \u2013 if the story was about growing older and life changing, for example.

Our specific interest in there is looking at how to embed long-term considerations into economic thinking. \n\nThe DDLT team is preparing a webinar, and has asked participants for an element of inspiration. We have chosen an experience from Sicily, that the Edgeryders board visited only a few weeks ago. I present it below, in the format we are using for the webinar. Quotes are taken from my notes from the presentation they gave us.\n\n\n## What?\n\nA cluster of companies (many of which co-operatives), non-profits, research and art organizations, co-ordinated by Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 Messina (http://www.fdcmessina.org, henceforth FCM). This cluster consists of 120 local enterprises, employing some 400 people, created or consolidated in the last 20 years in or near the city of Messina, in Sicily.\n\n\n## Who and what is involved? Who are the key players? Dynamics?\n\nThe process was initiated in 1998 by a group of local people led by a physicist; they started by creating a research centre called EcosMed. EcosMed took on the mantle of championing a specific vision for local development, and over time managed to get several other enterprises up and running and working together as a cluster (see below). In 2010, they leveraged a European policy (green certificates for producing renewable energy) and a national/regional one (a large foundation called Fondazione con il Sud was doubling capital to any Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 being constituted in Italy\u2019s Mezzogiorno) to create FCM as a superstructure. FCM also has institutional partners, like business associations and a cooperative bank called Banca Etica. FCM used its capital to give solar panels to whoever wanted them: they created a \u201cpeople\u2019s energy company\u201d and installed 2MW of photovoltaic capacity. The green certificates made sure that FCM could then count on 20 years of subsidies; it thus transformed a pile of dead money into a stable revenue stream.\n\n\n## Why is this interesting? What is the edge of the approach?\n\nFrom an economic point of view, the cluster made three moves which contain the seeds of long-termism.\n\n1. **Relational goods**. Some goods store value because they encode relationships. Example: several world-famous artists in the Mediterranean area donated pieces to Fondazione Horcynus Orca, the cluster\u2019s main art org. In fact, FHO runs a contemporary art museum that never bought any piece, everything was donated or produced in-house via artist residencies. This collection is worth several millions, but of course FHO could not really sell it except in very dire circumstances. Instead, they leverage it to attract private donors. Other example: Messina had a local brewery, Birrificio di Messina. This was purchased by Heineken, that ended up closing the plant and relocating production, keeping the brand. FCM persuaded the laid-off workers to start a cooperative to make a new brewery, and attracted a 6M EUR investment. 700 people attended the brewery\u2019s grandopening, because \n\n    > the beer tastes very good, but it also carries the values of dignity, community resurrection and human development to purchasers. \n\n    The new company was already turning a profit in its first year.\n\n2. **Stocks over flows**. The creation of FCM marked a shift from producing income (a flow) to fund Messina\u2019s social and civic transformation to securing the capital (various stocks) that generate that income. The difference is resilience: if you are sitting on your own stocks, you are not at the mercy of short-term changes in market conditions (or, worse, funding landscapes), and you have the breathing space to plan countermoves when difficulties strike.\n\n3. **A system, not a network**. \n\n    > In a network, participants look for how to make the most of what others are doing. In a system, participants are willing to re-orient their work, so as to better work with the other participants. If you are a construction company, you must not be lazy, and be open to using new technologies. If you are a social cooperative, you must look away from providing standardized services to customizing what you do in order to better valorize the capabilities of the people they are assisting. And so on.\n\n\n## Questions it sparks? \n\n**What does this make you want to learn more about?**\n\nHow do you get from zero to a fully formed cluster? The Messina fledgling cluster survived 12 years before FCM was launched, \u201cwith great difficulty\u201d.\n\nCan you imagine a similar approach for larger territories? What would it look like?\n\n\n## Assumptions?\n\n**What assumptions are underlying the logic of X? How do they see the world? What does it mean for systems transformation?**\n\n> We believe that there is a correlation between the environmental crisis and inequality. We are seeing: irreversibilities in the environmental crisis and so much inequality that it is even stifling traditional economic development. Some systems are imbalanced.\n>\n> One is this: starting in 1970, the speed of technological advancement is such that communities cannot build, around them, an appropriate culture and ethics in managing them. This creates collective stress in local communities. They are, however, marginalized from them, because technology\u2019s governance happens at, and for, the global scale.\n> \n> Another: as we know, our civilization is not sustainable as far as the consumption of resources is concerned.\n>\n> And a third: financial power is more and more global, democratic systems have stayed local and are displaced.\n>\n> Given this context, our foundation is experimenting on new paradigms for governance, the economy etc. Our key concept is that of limit. Our key resource is what we call human development. This happens by interlinking closely the productive, cultural and welfare systems. To do that, we bring to bear the territory's capabilities. Part of this is talent attraction.\n>\n> More specifically, we are experimenting with models that constrain the logic of profit maximization. The constraints:\n>\n> 1. Expand freedom, especially that of the weakest\n> 2. Build social capital\n> 3. Protect ecosystems\n> 4. Supply beauty.\u201d\n\n\n## Learnings?\n\nThe Messina experience is very rich. We are trying to establish a strategic partnership with them, but that has slowed because of COVID-19. One fairly obvious learning: to act effectively, change permanently the incentives to which players on the ground. \n\n>Our foundation provides economic resources to this territory, But it never funds projects: it funds permanent policies. Its pillars:\n>\n>1. Promote cooperative social and economic systems, which are very biodiverse. They have culture, finance, scientific research etc. These systems need to be able to promote alternatives in the areas of working, housing, socializing and learning.\n> 2. Reinterpret welfare towards personalized paths actively supporting each beneficiary in recognizing the alternatives generated by the system, and thus increase its freedom.\u201d\n\n\n## Link to our Deep Demonstration\n\n**How does X relate to our areas of action? What new areas of exploration might this open? What area of exploration is this part of?**\n\nDifferent components of the cluster address different AoAs. For example, FCM itself is about resetting the rules of the game through policy. FHO more about spinning new narratives, with the mystique of the Mediterranean as a koin\u00e9 of commerce, knowledge and peace. ECOSMED took the lead on reforming notions of value.\n\nWe submit that the Messina cluster *is* a deep demonstration of long-termism. It is a micro-economy that thinks very long-term, and is able to survive, and even thrive, in a context of alien, even hostile macro-systems.", "created_at": "2020-03-18 18:36:12.025542", "updated_at": "2020-12-13 08:26:33.388795", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1242, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 666.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5268, 428], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57229, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 10411, "post_number": 5, "raw": "I'm not sure where to enter info about IoH topics, such as the one I just started with 3 podcasts I edited..\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-internet-of-humans-fellows-interviews-and-podcasts-with-peter-bihr/10423", "created_at": "2019-07-29 02:22:35.644513", "updated_at": "2019-07-29 02:22:35.644513", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 39, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 26.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [57225], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4986], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44260, "user_id": 2701, "topic_id": 8500, "post_number": 13, "raw": "[Expo2020](https://www.expo2020dubai.com/) is funding the first 5 Moroccan challenges, and we are currently in discussions with other institutions and donors to cofinance future challenges.\n\nIf any of your projects are currently facing specific technical, economic or design challenges, now is the time to submit!", "created_at": "2018-04-25 16:19:13.936607", "updated_at": "2018-04-25 16:19:13.936607", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 47, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 13.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [44066], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17825, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2994, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Nice!

And so it began..\n\n![image|504x380](upload://k7v3GFjYHwWr7pTwZYaOLfkv2Hj.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-10-13 19:36:52.597772", "updated_at": "2020-10-13 19:36:52.597772", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 169, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 153.6, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 6417, 4, 6670, 1877, 8, 3, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61206, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 11114, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I will take care of the loose nodes next week :)", "created_at": "2019-10-12 10:50:51.628708", "updated_at": "2019-10-12 10:50:51.628708", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 36.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 43969, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 6811, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Hi @matthias and @alberto  \n\nI'm making a coding guide/course on OE, and I've realised that there doesn't seem to be a way to merge codes in OE anymore, or to see the annotations associated with the codes. \n\nAm I incorrect?

Description here: https://festival.edgeryders.eu/#mission \n\n2. **What this means in practice:** We try to cut down the investment of time and effort needed for people to discover, understand and build on one another\u2019s work. This involves posting a personal introduction to oneself and ones work on an online platform. Then our community managers draw the attention of others who have complimentary interests, needs, skills and or access to people who might: and the other way around. People read one another's stories/intros and post questions and answers through comments. Our community managers and research team reads/processes the conversations that develop, to find common ground between people having many separate conversations happening in parallel. We also have hired staff to scouting relevant opportunities to support people\u2019s work. These includes proposing joint applications to specific research grants or building financially viable projects to support long term work on issues. For methodology: [see here](http://academy.edgeryders.eu/) .\n\n3. **A social/fun, time limited way to get started:** To make it easy we schedule a one-on-one call to do an in depth interview that is more in conversation form. Then transcribe and do a first edit into a skeleton post for the interviewee to edit till they are happy, and when they are ready they post it under their own name. It takes a bit of an upfront investment to really get going: Approximately 2.5 hrs including interview time, responding to comments with questions from other participants, and a bit of prep whenever there are events you would like to participate in.\n\n4. **It's solid & run by grown-ups:** We have been doing this work since 2013. Over time we have grown into a community, stewarded by a group of nice, fairly bright people. At present the community of people who are connecting this way on and offline is around 5000 people in +80 countries. It is an open, self-selecting network of people and diverse in the true sense of the word - but people who participate tend to be bright, curious, friendly and committed to the common good.\n\nAny thoughts, additions or resources you would like to add to this?", "created_at": "2019-10-05 08:20:10.859836", "updated_at": "2019-10-05 08:22:50.801891", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 435, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 41.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61207, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10733, "post_number": 8, "raw": "it's not dead but it will be different, on Monday we're confirming the venue, then the speakers, i will have an updated version in a week", "created_at": "2019-10-12 10:51:59.483950", "updated_at": "2019-10-12 10:51:59.483950", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [61188], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53821, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9869, "post_number": 4, "raw": "[quote=\"JuliaV, post:2, topic:9869\"]\nThat\u2019s great.

Once such a fabric of relationships exists (and the open space would be to facilitate it), the appearance of colonizing should be gone for good ...\n\n", "created_at": "2013-05-26 17:11:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:04.390909", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 137, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21292], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29906, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1144, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Uhm?</b>\n\nRead it, was quite a fascinating read.

Refactoring the frontend is going really well and it'll be easy to add the features we need to take the platform to MVP once I'm done with that milestone (which is soon). \n\nOne notable change I'm making: During the initial hackathon we set a direction for the frontend where we're using [inline editing rather than an edit view](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/28210/inline-editing-vs-edit-view) to update needs and responsibilities. I'm swapping that around so that we use an edit view instead. There's two reasons for this: \n\n1. The library we're using for inline forms, _riek_, has 300 stars on github and hasn't been updated for a year. If we switch to an edit view pattern we can use something more conventional like Formik, which has 10,000 stars on github and is continuously maintained. \n2. I think an edit view will actually be easier for the user to understand and cause fewer accidental edits due to missclicks, etc. This is up for debate however and I might be wrong about this. \n\nIt might be less exciting but I think it'll save us (and users) some frustration down the line.\n\nAs soon as I have a working refactor (more like refactor + upgrade) I'll push to github so everyone can see.", "created_at": "2018-09-27 09:37:56.223251", "updated_at": "2018-09-27 09:37:56.223251", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 241, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 69.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 4667], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27051, "user_id": 85, "topic_id": 1409, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Historical context</b>\n\nI am aware of this particular paper by Fairlie.

The way I see it, it works with a three-layers mechanism.\u00a0\n\nThe first layer is human and project-side. It is made of <strong>animation and facilitation</strong>: the Edgeryders team sets a goal, designs campaigns, promotes them online and off-. Also, once the conversation got going, engagement managers were encouraged to introduce Edgeryders to each other on the basis of common interests: \"Welcome to Edgeryders, Alice! You should definitely meet Bob [link], as you two share an interest in techniques for cooking turnips while on Mars.\" And finally, the think-tank ethos gives everybody explicit permission to join in each and every conversation.\n\nThe second layer is technological and project-side. It is made of <strong>design choices</strong> that (1) disables most channels made available by Drupal Commons (fora, blogs, wikis, events) \"forcing\" everything into the mission brief-mission report-comments cycle; (2) streams all activities onto a feed which is then very prominently displayed at the top of the home page; (3) sends people email notifications whenever a new mission report is posted. This layer serves to increase the probability that Edgeryders come into contact with other Edgeryders and information they are not looking for.\n\nThe third layer is human and user-side. It is made of <strong>your own interests, idiosyncracies and obsessions</strong> that filter out stuff and people you are not interested in and retains the ones you are.\u00a0\n\nThe combined results of these three factors facilitates the \"grouping\" of Edgeryders by interest - which I guess is what happened in most of the cases (but not all: a couple of subcommunities seem to be determined by language choices).\u00a0\n\nBy the way, congratulations on achieving the highest betweenneess centrality value not only in Subcommunity 1, but in all Edgeryders! :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-08-02 09:27:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:07.332082", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 344, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9437], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14497, "user_id": 2754, "topic_id": 5091, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Extension chords, kettle &amp; mugs</b>\n\n<span>I can sort out these things, sure.

They gain access to affordable, sociable, sustainable, beautiful homes, and a way into owning property.\n* **Mayors and neighborhoods:**  they gain poles of attraction for pioneers and businesses serving them.\n* **The construction industry:**  it gains a new market.\n* **Owners of unused real estate:**  they get the opportunity to utilize their hard-to-convert industrial empty buildings and similar \u201cdifficult\u201d real estate.\n* **The greentech industry:**  it gains a living lab for mission-oriented innovation and a new market.\n* **Planet Earth.**\n\n## What are the\n**city-level benefits?**\n\n* **Easier access to the property market:**  fractional ownership allows younger and less affluent individuals to get into the property market on a small budget.\n* **Neighborhood development:**  a focal point for developing the local markets that matter for neighborhood quality: healthy food, preventative health care, sports and culture. It replaces gentrification with greening.\n* **City attractiveness:**  through its partnership with EIT Climate-KIC, the Reef sits at the center of a world-class network of R&D on green living and green infrastructure. It puts partner cities at the tip of the spear of the European Green New Deal.\n\n<hr>\n\n## Enquiries\ncompany@edgeryders.eu\n\n```\n---\nconfig:\n  baseUrl: https://edgeryders.eu\n  title: The Reef | Edgeryders\nstyle:\n  fonts: [\"Ubuntu:400,500,700,800,900\"]\n  title:\n    width: [90%, 75%]\n    padding: [0 0 10px]\n    align: [left]\n    font: [Ubuntu]\n    weight: ['600']\n    size: [text-2xl, text-3xl]\nblocks:\n- type: Header\n  views:\n  - menu:\n      config:\n        id: false\n        external: \n          - text: Start\n            url: https://edgeryders.eu/t/start-page/13522\n          - text: About Us\n            url: https://edgeryders.eu/t/about-us/13524\n          - text: Services\n            url: https://edgeryders.eu/t/our-services/13475\n          - text: Methods\n            url: https://edgeryders.eu/t/data-science-collective-intelligence-technology/13472\n          - text: Themes\n            url: https://edgeryders.eu/t/thematic-clusters/13484\n          - text: People\n            url: https://edgeryders.eu/t/our-people/13474/2\n          - text: Projects\n            url: https://edgeryders.eu/t/projects/13526\n          - text: Impact strategy\n            url: https://edgeryders.eu/t/impact-strategy/13612\n          - text: Blog\n            url: https://edgeryders.eu/tags/blog?view=topic-preview\n      style:\n        position: [fixed]\n        height: [2rem]\n  - hero:\n      config:\n        template: standard\n      style:\n        wrapper:\n          width: [90%, 65%]\n          padding: [20px 10px, 70px 0]\n        button:\n          background: [white]\n          color: [black]\n          class: [border-b border-gray-300 py-2 font-bold mr-4 text-sm]\n      title: The Reef\n      text: A new kind of living space.

Ale wiele si\u0119 zmieni\u0142o we mnie w tej kwestii. Dojrza\u0142am.Ten temat dotkn\u0105\u0142 mnie bardzo osobi\u015bcie, kiedy zakocha\u0142am si\u0119 w m\u0119\u017cczy\u017anie, kt\u00f3ry okaza\u0142 si\u0119 by\u0107 gejem. Zacz\u0119\u0142am szuka\u0107 informacji, czyta\u0107, du\u017co my\u015ble\u0107 na ten temat. Zacz\u0119\u0142am zadawa\u0107 sobie pytania i skonfrontowa\u0142am si\u0119 ze swoim dotychczasowym obrazem tego tematu. \n\nM\u00f3j obraz bardzo ewoluowa\u0142. Teraz mam poczucie, \u017ce cho\u0107 nie rozumiem tego zjawiska, to absolutnie nie pot\u0119piam homoseksualist\u00f3w. Nie umiem si\u0119 wczu\u0107 w to jak mo\u017cna po\u017c\u0105da\u0107 osob\u0119 tej samej p\u0142ci, ale wiem, \u017ce ludzie tak maj\u0105. Z jakiego powodu, nie wiem, ale tak maj\u0105. Nie umiem na to pytanie odpowiedzie\u0107 i daleka jestem od zachwytu nad tym zjawiskiem, bo jest to dla mnie nienaturalne, ale nie widz\u0119 powodu, \u017ceby nie zadawa\u0107 si\u0119 takimi osobami. Cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 swojej opinii opiera\u0142am na Biblii i faktycznie jest napisane na pocz\u0105tku drugiego rozdzia\u0142u listu do Rzymian, \u017ce to jest obrzydliwe w oczach Boga. \n\nNatomiast jedn\u0105 rzecz\u0105 jest Biblia, kt\u00f3ra jest dla mnie fundamentem, czym\u015b wa\u017cnym, ale uwa\u017cam, \u017ce przede wszystkim Pan B\u00f3g kocha wszystkich ludzi. Pr\u00f3bowa\u0142am dowiedzie\u0107 si\u0119 na temat w jaki spos\u00f3b powstaje homoseksualizm i przyczyny mog\u0105 by\u0107 bardzo r\u00f3\u017cne. I uzna\u0142am, \u017ce nie mo\u017cna w ten spos\u00f3b traktowa\u0107 ludzi, czy ocenia\u0107, z reszt\u0105 z wiekiem cz\u0142owiek staje si\u0119 mniej kategoryczny. Ja staj\u0119 si\u0119 mniej kategoryczna. Mo\u017ce to wynika z tego, \u017ce staram si\u0119 szuka\u0107 odpowiedzi, rozwi\u0105za\u0144. \n\nKiedy\u015b by\u0142am w ostrej &quot;fazie&quot; ko\u015bcielnej, a by\u0142am w takiej fazie do\u015b\u0107 d\u0142ugo. Ten etap rozpocz\u0105\u0142 si\u0119 dawno temu po tym jak jeden go\u015b\u0107 wystawi\u0142 mnie do wiatru, to by\u0142 wyzwalacz. Ale wszystko tak naprawd\u0119 zmieni\u0142o si\u0119 po wypadku, kt\u00f3rego do\u015bwiadczy\u0142am- zapad\u0142am w \u015bpi\u0105czk\u0119 na pewien czas. To mia\u0142o kolosalne znaczenie, dlaczego tak gorliwie odda\u0142am si\u0119 modlitwie. Ale zdecydowanie moje pogl\u0105dy zradykalizowa\u0142y si\u0119 gdy zacz\u0119\u0142am by\u0107 w ko\u015bciele, we wsp\u00f3lnocie ko\u015bcielnej, kt\u00f3ra by\u0142a teoretycznie katolicka, a tak na prawd\u0119 okaza\u0142a si\u0119 z czasem by\u0107 sekt\u0105, mia\u0142a jej wszelkie znamiona. Nadal jest w strukturach ko\u015bcio\u0142a. To mia\u0142o bardzo du\u017cy wp\u0142yw na m\u00f3j \u015bwiatopogl\u0105d, na moje funkcjonowanie. \n\nOdesz\u0142am stamt\u0105d bardzo dawno temu... Za spraw\u0105 romansu z \u017conatym m\u0119\u017cczyzn\u0105. Przydarzy\u0142o mi si\u0119 co\u015b, co przez ca\u0142e moje dotychczasowe \u017cycie by\u0142o absolutnie niedopuszczalne i ja w \u017cyciu sobie nie wyobra\u017ca\u0142am, \u017ce mog\u0119 co\u015b takiego pope\u0142ni\u0107. Z\u0142ama\u0142am jedn\u0105 z naczelnych moralnych zasad, kt\u00f3re mi wpajano. Nie chc\u0119 powiedzie\u0107 \u017ce to jest z\u0142a zasada. To by\u0142 moment prze\u0142omowy w moim \u017cyciu. \n\nZauwa\u017cy\u0142am, \u017ce mimo moich pi\u0119knych zasad przydarzy\u0142o mi si\u0119 co\u015b, czego nie umia\u0142am wyt\u0142umaczy\u0107 i nagle wszystkie zasady przesta\u0142y by\u0107 wa\u017cne. Bardzo zmaga\u0142am si\u0119 z tym, \u017ce nie mog\u0142am o tym nikomu powiedzie\u0107. Pami\u0119tam, \u017ce zanim mi si\u0119 to przydarzy\u0142o, moja przyjaci\u00f3\u0142ka wyzna\u0142a mi, \u017ce jest lesbijk\u0105. Moja reakcja na to, a to by\u0142o par\u0119 lat przed moj\u0105 histori\u0105, by\u0142a bardzo mocna. Zruga\u0142am j\u0105, powiedzia\u0142em, \u017ce jest zboczona i nie mog\u0142am tego ogarn\u0105\u0107, zw\u0142aszcza, \u017ce ona by\u0142a osob\u0105, kt\u00f3ra mnie wprowadzi\u0142a do Ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Kiedy mi si\u0119 to przydarzy\u0142o u\u015bwiadomi\u0142am sobie, \u017ce ona pewnie prze\u017cywa\u0142a koszmar. \u017be nie mog\u0142a swobodnie dzieli\u0107 si\u0119 rado\u015bci\u0105 tego, \u017ce jest z kim\u015b w zwi\u0105zku. Prze\u017cywa\u0107 zupe\u0142nie swobodnie, okazywa\u0107 to. Pomijam ju\u017c zupe\u0142nie fakt, czy mi si\u0119 to podoba, czy nie. Dop\u00f3ki samemu nie pozna si\u0119, dotknie si\u0119 inno\u015bci, albo nas nie spotka trudna historia, to mamy tylko teori\u0119. Z daleka widzi si\u0119 rzeczy zupe\u0142nie inaczej. \n\nMoja babcia od ma\u0142ego przekazywa\u0142a nam wiar\u0119, uczy\u0142a pacierza, \u015bpiewa\u0142a z nami r\u00f3\u017cne piosenki, zabiera\u0142a nas do ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Moi rodzice nie byli jako\u015b szczeg\u00f3lnie praktykuj\u0105cymi katolikami do czasu mojego wypadku, kt\u00f3ry wszystko odmieni\u0142. Trudno inaczej traktowa\u0107 to, \u017ce \u017cyj\u0119 ni\u017c w kategoriach cudu. M\u00f3j tata si\u0119 wtedy nawr\u00f3ci\u0142 i kupi\u0142 Bibli\u0119, pierwsz\u0105 w swoim \u017cyciu. Jak tylko j\u0105 kupi\u0142, otworzy\u0142 na chybi\u0142-trafi\u0142 i pierwsze s\u0142owa, kt\u00f3re wyczyta\u0142 to by\u0142y: \"Ta choroba nie jest na \u015bmier\u0107, ale na chwa\u0142\u0119 Bo\u017c\u0105\" . Ja bardzo szybko dosz\u0142am do siebie po tym nawr\u00f3ceniu rodzic\u00f3w i w sumie po 10 miesi\u0105cach wysz\u0142am o w\u0142asnych nogach i wr\u00f3ci\u0142am do szko\u0142y, mimo, \u017ce mam tylko po\u0142ow\u0119 m\u00f3zgu sprawn\u0105.

It is by 'doing science together' that we combine our resources and expertise to raise awareness, build capacity, and innovative lasting solutions grounded in society._\" This is the motto of our project TogetherScience.eu. \n\nHello Everyone! It is with great excitement that I join the first #OpenVillage in Brussels. At OpenVillage I look forward to meeting and learning from you all and being inspired by your ideas, approaches, joy for life, and drive. I also look forward to roll-up my sleeves and connect, hands-on, with projects that seek to engender meaningful change socially and personally.\n\nAs many of you reading this, I wear 'several hats', pulling knowledge, ideas, and resources from various sources and experiences to create engaging spaces/conditions for enriching exchanges. My hats: I am a research associate at the Extreme Citizen Science research group with Prof Muki Haklay at University College London. Here I develop and promote techniques for public engagement in Do-It-Yourself science and technology. My research focuses on the taken-for-granted process of inquiry that underlie all exploration and discovery and which represent ownership over learning and action: figuring things out by oneself, experimenting, seeking knowledge, and questioning the state of things to find potential solutions to local concerns. I have also developed frameworks for the understanding of factors influencing our engagement in inquiry and initiative-taking at the personal, organisational, and societal levels. I am also a London-based community organiser for the [Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science](https://publiclab.org/), a not-for-profit organisation and community that creates accessible, low-cost civically engaged monitoring methods. As community organiser I work with communities, researchers, and stewards on the use and development of DIY tools for environmental monitoring. I am also co-founder of Citizens without Borders, a London-based group dedicated to creating spaces for exchange that build the public\u2019s capacity to act as civic agents. I am founder of  '[Science has no Borders](https://www.meetup.com/Science-has-no-Borders/)', an initiative through our project TogetherScience.eu, which is committed to science that benefits from community and aims at creating an environment for networked engagement to learn, connect, and gain feedback on ideas, prototypes, and projects. Together with my team at UCL we  lead on the Horizon 2020 EU project, \"Doing It Together Science\" - TogetherScience.eu, which aims to bridge the gap between civic agency in science/technology and policy. In this project I focus on consortium management, development of public engagement activities in Biodesign and Environmental Sustainability, the formative evaluation of the project, and the capacity building, self-care, and well-being of science event facilitators and 'DIY science educators'. For the latter, we are creating online resources on shared good practice, gaining meaningful feedback, engagement, outreach, science communication, and inclusion techniques.\n\nI'll be participating in the **Infrastructures for Autonomy panel** discussing sustainability of initiatives and organiser's self-care. I will be also video-documenting your learning and experiences at the festival - look out for a video camera if you'd like to share your voice (and discuss how the videos will be used)!", "created_at": "2017-09-19 08:52:53.374681", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 21:18:43.375105", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 546, "wiki": false, "reads": 31, "score": 206.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3, 3704, 3362], "is_private": false}, {"id": 367, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 334, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Rossella of MT2019 had a good idea: create a page in Italian in the LOTE3 minisite to act as a single entry point for Materans to join in.

We never set sail to produce baseline communism, we launched our project to find a sustainable alternative to a failing model.\nI would also argue that here you are playing with words, mixing contracts (the legal pact binding two or more parties), and social contracts... social contract do not arise in exchange, the exist anywhere people co-live... in whatever form they may take at a certain moment, they explain how people are trading off trust, cooperation, competition, and whatnot... \n\nThe Amish, as instance, do not reject risk mitigation... they reject its financial form (insurances), but have put behavioural rules and community oversight that cover the same needs... ultimately the mutual help they offer IS risk mitigation... skin in the game looks a bit different, and they only practice it for those breaking their social contract engaging in risky (immoral?) behaviours.\n\nYour second point, with due respect, ignores the abundant psychological and medical literature on burn-out. You are entitled to your opinions. However, the \"failing\" scenario and the \"people overextending\" are exactly the same scenario... the latter is one of the most common forms you encounter of the first. Again, plenty of literature about the cascade effect of breaking limits when offering care, and the transformation of societies when the care-givers become people in need... not something you want to produce by design.\n\nYour final point is what surprises me the most. We have spent so much time discussing how to make something viable avoiding overheads, that your comment brings me 1 year in the past. You are talking a \"limousine project\" DIY pancreas as if all the initiatives we have seen were the same. \nNot everyone monitors, documents, or understand how to scale... because when you are in the grey area you may lack the confidence for asking, or people may not take you seriously (we live in a strongly polarised society), you may simply not have access to some resources...\nBut again I understand you misunderstand the social contract for a contract... what we wrote is an attempt at making explicit the social contract that already makes community driven care work (or not), as a guide for people setting out with a new project, or struggling with a running one, to have the opportunity of reflecting on their value chain, and find their own solutions\n\nThe platform we work on, OpenCare, which puts projects in touch with each other, which uses openethnographer to  spot groups talking of similar topics to allow someone to suggest they get in touch, on which questions can be asked about doubts or discomfortable situations, in which uncertain practices are offered to oversight of others... that's really the kind of need it satisfies... a LOT more than authorship (please, count the number of new care initiatives started here, or the number of innovations... and compare with the conversation about understanding something)... and I am sure you don't consider what you do an overhead. \nWhy are you so stuck in thinking it is for them?", "created_at": "2017-09-07 05:58:44.079509", "updated_at": "2017-09-07 05:58:44.079509", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 530, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 8.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [35669], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62192, "user_id": 5483, "topic_id": 11224, "post_number": 16, "raw": "@mrchrisadams and I will chat about this on Friday.

(Though we have the \"exemption from using Ltd\" clause in our Cerificate of Incorporation, allowing us to use just \"Edgeryders\" as a company name.)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-29 15:50:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:28.498550", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 84, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11505, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2564, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Did that. Still...</b>\n\n... I am quite surprised that I there seems to be nowhere for me to \"name my price\", give some sort of numeraire that I am prepared to pay for what I am asking.\u00a0\n\nIn general, I am confused by the lack of symmetry on Makerfox right now. If I am selling, I get a serious form to input the characteristics of what I am selling: description, price, a drop-down menu for categories (and categorizing is compulsory \u2013 categories now are a bit silly and they stop at the letter B, but you already said you are reworking them). If I am buying, I don't get that. I appreciate some of the fields are redundant (you typically don't have a picture of an item you are looking for), but others are not: at least description, category, price.\u00a0\n\nAnother minor point, under the symmetry heading, you are using the word \"market\" as a marker of demand schedule. This is unclear: a market is a device to match demand and supply schedules, and especially in a bartering context one goes to the market not just to buy, but to sell too. I would pick an array of metaphors and then stick to it: for example \"buy\" and \"sell\", or \"demand\" and \"supply\", or whatever.\u00a0\n\nIf people's brains work like mine they will be tempted to use the Market part of the website to come up with offers. For example, as I browsed through available offers, I decided to offer to sunbtitle an Italian video (<a href=\"http://www.makerfox.com/market/services/65\">http://www.makerfox.com/market/services/65</a>). The system shows me no one is offering this at the moment, and this might be a chance for me. But I can't find anywhere to do that. I did create a service, but given the glitch in the categories it does not show up anywhere, and anyway I had to go around. Maybe you want a link that says \"offer this!\" and another one that says \"request this!\" next to the list of items, whether you are in a demand or supply context. This improves the likelihood of closing deals by working on the human part of the system: the list works as a device for surfacing people's needs and offers, just like you looking at my wish and telling yourself \"hey, I actually have got one of those lying around\". The result is that offers and requests \"sync\" on each other instead of being random.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-23 09:43:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:06.300861", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 436, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8828], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36587, "user_id": 2095, "topic_id": 7006, "post_number": 8, "raw": "I thought maybe you can develop the idea and serve a different group of people, _thinking of people in your beloved Nepal._", "created_at": "2017-09-19 11:07:58.295762", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 11:07:58.295762", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 23, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 3.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [36585], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44006, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 6811, "post_number": 21, "raw": "Good, will be implemented as requested.

You get a mini projector, and small bluetooth speaker, and project a film on a wall somewhere public. Have some foldable chairs there and record the conversations with your phone. You then make a post with the video of the movie trailer for what you say, and the documentation of what you heard in the conversations. Inviting people to join the final event by signing up on platform and sharing their own thoughts about the film/text contents.

Often it evolves into collaborative projects.\n\nWe build a deep experience that no small group or individual could reach on their own through our dense networks. Having a dense network gives you access to expertise, resources, skill sharing and financing.\n\nWe join ideas and people to each other, to other knowledge, skills and resources, which means the members of our community gain a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n\nSo, ahead of XXX event, we ask that you join the Edgeryders community by signing [up here](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login).

In blue, Polish; in red, Czech; in green, English; in orange, Serbian; in purple, German. In gray, users that participate to more than one sub-forum \u2013 there are 28 of them out of 266.

Since 2020-05-15 we switched to a new strategy for coding, where we no longer provide support for coding in Serbian. This seems to have paid off: in just over two months, the number of annotations more thandoubled, which means that we have been coding at minimum 6 times the rate we had kept before. Coding in Czech, and even more so Polish, have made a big step forward. Coding in Serbian also made progress. It appears to have sped up its own pace. \n\nThis is shown in the table below. Notice that, while adding annotations almost always means progress in the work, adding codes does not. Codes are created, but periodically merged into each other, so that a reduction in the number of codes can mean progress to. Also, it can be associated with an increase in the number of annotations.\n\n<!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n\n|||Annotations|||Codes||\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|**Forum**|*up to May 15th*|*up to July 27th*|*difference*|*up to May 15th*|*up to July 27th*|*difference*|\n|English|496|644|148|288|293|5|\n|Polish|98|737|639|68|395|327|\n|Czech|364|736|372|143|332|189|\n|Serbian|210|276|66|120|137|17|\n|*Total*|*1,168*|*2,393*|*1,225*|*619*|*1,157*|*538*|\n\nWe have updated the interactive dashboard with this most recent batch of coding.

So I am trying to look in new directions for metaphors and naming ideas. One, of course, is the direction of the medieval monasteries. For example, the <i>scriptorium</i>\u00a0is the hall where monks copy manuscripts. The word comes from the Latin word for \"writing\". So,\u00a0<em>scriptorium</em>\u00a0would be a place for writing together. If we can find a Latin verb that describes what we do at LOTE, we can add the suffix -ium or -eum to denote the space. Another lovely Latin word (not a verb!) is\u00a0<em>artifex</em>, artisan or maker. Chapter 57 of the Rule is dedicated to the <em>artifices monasterii</em>.\u00a0\n\nA second direction is evolution. LOTEs are variability engines: they create new variants in our thinking, as we get exposed to interesting people and far-out ideas. Most new variants \"die\", but some take hold and change our way of looking at the world forever. Maybe we could call it\u00a0<em>recompositorium</em>, the place of recombining, but the Latin is a bit stretched. Evolution is itself a Latin word (it comes from the verb\u00a0<em>evolvere</em>, that means \"drag forward by rolling\"), but I cannot make it into a place in a convincing way.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-16 17:20:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:16.730882", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 294, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [82, 2146], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61874, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11207, "post_number": 3, "raw": "It's a hard sell - the word itself implies (unpleasant) sacrifices for somebody(ies) and that somebody might be you :) There isa reason so much money is thrown at metaphor crafters, framing of narratives etc.", "created_at": "2019-10-21 20:46:11.854595", "updated_at": "2019-10-21 20:46:32.159572", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 35, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 21.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5092], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8805, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3668, "post_number": 2, "raw": "These words are truely uplifting.

If we had a year it might be easier, or established cycles that ensure an expected refresh point, right now it's hard. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nOne thing that is very clear to me though is that in order to have a meaningful and productive dialogue online about internal issues, there really needs to be a catalogue of things that do and do not work that are spoken from the unMonastery, so that from a distance you have more handles to grapple with the issues at stake and avoid stepping on things that are not seen - this for sure is a mutual responsibility that goes both ways.\n\nHierarchy may be present in my role but that is at least defined (and people have learnt face-to-face for the most part I am benevolent, if not a little too soft but we're all learning). However hierarchy also exists in these sorts of exchanges and the sort of power and influence which is at play, which at no point has been well defined, it is instead very diffuse, both with individuals, EdgeRyders LBG as an entity and MT2019 - which creates unease, particularly for people who have not followed the same path we have over the past few years. It's implicit power of this variety that keeps many people you'd expect to be speaking here quiet - this is something to be acknowledged and excavated at a later date because it represents a threat to the health and stability of the community going forward.\u00a0\n\nI will respectfully drop the rhetoric (but expand my motivation and concern at a later date) - but lastly we have an enormous issue in amongst all this discussion of the rule and how to reconcile certain things that would otherwise be simple for those operating under the Benedictine Rule from which we draw; We are without God in our lives. So the struggle to retain faith in our daily lives is a difficult one.\u00a0\n\nWhat do?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-22 16:35:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:48.315207", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 444, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 15.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19312], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29629, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3117, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Yes, much to explore here</b>\n\n<em>That</em> area you are diving into is indeed one with lots of unexplored options how \"translating\" could be organized.

You earn points by translating, you spend points on translations. Since it's all about small translation jobs (small investments of time, no investment of cash money), the trust issues are limited and a mini-currency can indeed work there.
