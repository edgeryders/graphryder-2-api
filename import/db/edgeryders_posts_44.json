Instructions for registering below.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Context</h3>\n\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Capital_of_Culture\">European Capital of Culture</a> (ECoC) is an opportunity for deep cultural change more than a competition with a prize. Cities can rethink the way citizens participate in culture making, as (co-)creators rather than producers or consumers. But does the experience of cities committed to undergo profound transformations confirm this?  ECoC is failing in many ways.\n\nECoC strives to <em>\"bring together all stakeholders for a shared vision of change which makes sense both for the locals and for the institutions at all levels. This is quite unique\" </em>(@ilariadauria). Factor in the European thinking that should be present in the bid, the multi-annual planning and political commitment required, and one sees the many risks of failure in such a complex task. What do we need to better navigate this kind of complexity and minimize waste of energy, resources, (public) money?\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Hypothesis</h3>\n\nCulture making at the center would benefit from greater participation of non-experts traditionally seen as \u201cconsumers\u201d, yet we don't see enough of it.\n\nIncreasingly, citizens from all over coordinate and work together in new ways, deeply participatory: in democracy (street movements turned political parties), in economy (decentralization of financial institutions), in social cohesion (hacking reception of migrants). Culture is about all of these and more. If properly brought in, <a href=\"http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=5056&amp;title=The-rise-of-the-citizen-expert\">non credentialed experts</a> can help overcome challenges administrations and policy makers have.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Can we work together to address this?</h3>\n\nNadia <a href=\"/t/can-culture-really-help-us-unfail-in-dealing-with-terrorism/5017\" target=\"_blank\">argued</a> recently that we need to start by shaping institutional demand for alternatives. But are administrations able to onboard new thinking in their organisation? Is there a tradeoff between keeping cultural funding more in control through traditional approaches and letting risks and innovation in? Does it depend on the individuals who make up the administration?\n\nIn this session we share insights and experiences of people who are at the intersection of public and private service, who are familiar with the struggle inside out. More than lessons sharing, this session aims to uncover new ways of working in cultural projects (no matter their size!) and new processes that involve a diversity of stakeholders in order to achive change. \n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Schedule</h3>\n\nPersonal journeys (5' pitches)\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"/t/bob-palmer-is-joining-living-on-the-edge-culture-un-fail/5075\">Robert (Bob) Palmer</a> will offer a birds-eye view on the current situation: where traditional experts and citizens fail to work together.

It can even be someone that never covers for you, as long as she covers for other people in the space (however you define its borders). So it is <em>network</em>\u00a0reciprocity.\u00a0But if you get the idea that someone is a free\u00a0rider, then covering for her is not so OK anymore. It can only be OK if you really live in abundance, and it does not matter. But most of us are a long way from there.\u00a0\n\nCommunity care takes away the externality of health care (\"the person that demands the care is not the person who is footing the bill\", as @Lakomaa likes to say). Tradeoffs become very explicit. The best example I have seen of this is the discussion of health care in Amish communities in the US. Amish refuse insurance (\"it de-responsabilises people\"). So, when a person gets sick, the church collects alms to help her front expenses.\u00a0<em>But</em>\u00a0this might happen\u00a0at a time when the community might be facing other expenses\u00a0(\"setting up a farm for a young couple\"). The community needs to decide what to do. The bottom line is: Amish people focus on\u00a0<em>preventative</em><span>\u00a0health care, because it's irt cheap and effective, and if they fall sick they are imposing a burden (however welcome) on their brothers and sisters. In other words, though the individuals are generous, the community does the economically efficient thing!

This theory is super-fascinating, and deserves its own discussion, so I will just leave it here. It might help to explain why you prefer to help people who share your values.\u00a0</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-16 16:33:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:37.795311", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 387, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28267], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31697, "user_id": 3045, "topic_id": 6159, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Tentative answers to Noemi's questions</b>\n\n<strong>Noemi's question 1: </strong><em>What's the difference between an </em><em>interest oriented</em><em> community and\u00a0a results one?</em>\n\n<strong>(A) </strong>A\u00a0<b>community of interest</b>, or interest-based community, is a\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community\" title=\"Community\">community</a>\u00a0of people who share a common interest or passion. These people exchange ideas and thoughts about the given passion, but may know (or care) little about each other outside of this area. Participation in a community of interest can be compelling, entertaining and create a community where people return frequently and remain for extended periods. Frequently, they cannot be easily defined by a particular geographical area <em>(Definition taken from Wikipedia)</em>.\n\n<strong>(B) </strong>A <strong>result-oriented\u00a0</strong><b>community</b> is\u00a0a group of individuals that can be quite diverse (in terms\u00a0of \u00a0knowledge,\u00a0experience, power resources, motivations\u00a0and interests), but decide to work together to achieve a result that, for different reasons, they all consider as a positive one. This means\u00a0that they must find personal meaning or self-interest in the result the community is committed to achieving. The process must be designed so that people are given every opportunity to understand and personally relate to the result and the data and information that support it.\u00a0\n\n<em>It comes that the nature and the way of working of the two communities a quite diverse.

Do you see the beginning points and the paths towards that community which you design? </em>\n\nI leave the real answer to Federico. I can only say that the case we discussed in Geneva where (mainly) following a trajectory from (A) to (B), where, in the \"open-rampette\" case, it is the opposite, i.e. from (B) to (A). Therefore the way to discuss them cannot be exactly the same. In my view, the interesting point of the\u00a0\"open-rampette\" case observation is to verify if an how is relevant the fact that some members of the (B) community created around the co-design process of the open rampette\u00a0are also members of the (A) community (of\u00a0edgeryders).\u00a0 And, if the answer is positive, in which way they played the role of bridging the two communities, feeding them with some kinds of information.\u00a0\n\nMy personal question on these doubel trajectories (A) &gt; (B) and (B) &gt;(A) can generate some forms of collective intelligence? And if the answer is yes, in which way?

Want to sneak in and find out what the game looks like? No can do, but a preview in terms of content might do the trick.\n\nLike any game, Edgeryders combines key elements which make it interesting:<strong></strong>\n\n<strong>Players</strong>: people of all ages and fron diverse locations who reasonate with the need to build a coherent narrative about the coordinates of transition nowadays<strong>\n\nPurpose</strong>: after six months of playing, Edgeryders will collaboratively edit the Policy Makers Transition Handbook<strong>\n\nCompetition</strong>: players gather points by completing missions, but they do it not only individually, also in teams; there are no adversaries; the focus per se is not to get ahead of other players, but to move forward in your own journey and contribute commulatively to achieving the purpose<strong>\n\nCampaigns</strong>: these are milestones or sequences of missions which belong to the same topic or aspect of transition. Playing Edgeryders means you start from the first one and you have to complete each mission to be able to move to the next campaign. Don\u2019t worry: there are briefs which introduce you to the topic and give you tips on how to gain points. Completing a mission not only brings points(=knowledge) to you, but also adds valuable content which all the players can benefit from. Whilst advancing in the game you get to exchange information with other players and put together resources, help each other out, find out a common strategy which could be of use to people both inside and outside Edgeryders. That type of information will be picked up when editing the Policy Makers Transition Handbook.\n\nConcretely, there are 9 campaigns waiting to be fuelled with content. This is only a summary of them because we wouldn\u2019t want to spoil all the fun of discovery.\n\n<ol start=\"1\">\n\n<li><strong>Bootcamp</strong>: in here players begin by sharing their stories, rating and commenting on others and finding trailblazers; these are people who inspire others due to something that they achieved or an approach they used to solve a problem; anybody can be nominated as a trailblazer</li>\n\n<li><strong>Making a living</strong>: this is the starting of a new narrative; we first look at how official data and discourse portray young people in the job market and compare it with our own, first end information; then we move from employment to social innovation, that is, see how others have managed to start careers and build innovative working spaces</li>\n\n<li><strong>Caring for commons</strong>: means learning strategies to preserve and enhance collective goods; these can be public spaces, both physical and virtual (e.g. digital commons)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Art, media and culture</strong>: how can we use these tools to challenge the traditional view on the young? Can we make the elders relate to our experience as a generation?<strong></strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Living together</strong>: this campaign looks at how we can value living and mobility by sharing; it also looks at sharing space in diverse communities and overcoming conflict; the question is: how do we improve mutual understanding between people inhabiting different corners of society?<strong></strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>Learning</strong>: this is a complex campaign! the aim is to fill in the dots between what we learn in formal education and what we can use in the job market; is there need for other skills and training? can less traditional education solve the problem? what knowledge is needed in making the transition?</li>\n\n<li><strong>WE, the people: </strong>in here, Edgeryders search for democratic channels to make the voices of the young heard; some of them may even learn to become activists. A shared goal is to learn strategies to participate and use government response to build the future</li>\n\n<li><strong>Resilience: </strong>this one is a campaign for what you call advanced players. The question we try to answer is : are you ready for the worst case scenario?

Do they (that is, we) point to a way? Do they (that is, we again) imply a vision of the future? Is this Internet stuff a legitimate way to design policy?

Assuming most of us will be there on June 20 (arriving in the evening, this is the case for the UBx team), this could take place June 21, 10am - noon.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-13 09:58:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:36.704767", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 122, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13292, "user_id": 32, "topic_id": 1238, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Brainstorming and funding</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlberto,\u00a0\n\n\"Rewarding parents that invest in the future by funding their children's ventures?\"\u00a0\n\nIt is an interesting suggestion. Like \"The Unconditional Investors\"! That sounds like something that could be further developed...\n\nI recently was thinking about this topic too since I just came back from a bootcamp in Lisbon about Silicon Valley and how the dynamics work there. Of course it's an easy task for Venture Capital there when the ecosystem is highly optimal (multicultural, multidisciplinary, 30% between 25 and 44 years old, and above all a big risk-taking mind-set!). That explains why over 40% of VC in all US is from Silicon Valley in 2011.\u00a0\n\nAt the bootcamp we also had the opportunity to receive insights from directors of VCs. You know what they said? \"We are FULL of (European) money that we want to spend on start ups but the problems is they aren't ready\". Lack of team motivation? skills? credibility? - In my opinion it's definitely an cultural issue around the notion of risk.\u00a0\n\nThe problem is definitely what you mentioned above: a huge gap between the idea and the start up aka between unexisting seed money and VCs.\n\nHow about making everyone that cares responsible for their own investments.

If you're not already familiar with the project here's our current definition:\n\n<strong>\"unMonastery is a new kind of social space, akin to co-living and co-working spaces, that aims to serve the local communities of towns or small cities in which it's situated by enabling a process of co-creation and co-learning between the community and unMonasterians. By embedding committed, skilled individuals in places with a deficit of diverse skills and knowledge it can solve social and infrastructural problems by enabling native inhabitants to realise their own potential. </strong>\n\n<strong>\n\nThe unMonastery recreates the best of the social functions present in the traditional monastery: by giving the unMonasterians a collective purpose, a chance to develop deep relationships with one another and a reduced need to generate personal income so time can be dedicated entirely to serving the local community.</strong><strong> \"\n\n</strong>\n\nWe've been making major progress with the development of unMonastery since the first \\#LOTE, in the past month alone, thanks to the burst of energy from \\#LOTE2 we've built the first iteration of the website (to be launched by the end of the January), we've applied for the European Social Innovation Prize, been offered a possible first location and established an online work space for collaboration. This blogpost is intended to give you an overview of what's happening and how you can get involved.\n\n<strong>unMonastery's ongoing development:</strong>\n\nIn order to collate all the content created so far and collaborate at a distance we've moved everything to the online workspace PBworks, which functions a lot like a wiki with the ability to divide tasks, set milestones and create content together. At the moment we're using this space to devise the internal unMonastery lore and governance model, write copy for the website and define the collective goals of the project. The front page can be view here: <a href=\"https://unmonastery-unmonastery.pbworks.com/\">https://unmonastery-unmonastery.pbworks.com/</a>\n\n<strong>How can I get involved?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>If you'd like to contribute directly email joinus@unmonastery.eu for access to the workspace.</li>\n\n<li>Join us for an online meetup on 23rd of January 1pm CET - <a href=\"http://unmonastery.eventbrite.com/\">http://unmonastery.eventbrite.com/</a>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>New Website: </strong>\n\nDuring \\#LOTE2 we attempted to sprint towards building a whole website in a weekend - defining requirements, designing layout, writing all the copy and building the thing. For 3 days work that was perhaps a little bit unrealistic but we did amazingly actually manage to get about 50% of the way there. In one single hour long session we managed to set requirements, design a logo and begin development. We're aiming to launch the first iteration of the site by the end of next week.\n\nThis is the current version of the site <a href=\"http://unmonastery.eu/index.php?cID=113\">http://unmonastery.eu/index.php?cID=113</a> we've deployed the site using Concrete5 as the CMS. Currently we just have a <a href=\"http://www.unmonastery.eu/\">holding site</a> online.\n\n<strong>How can I get involved?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Write content - we're using the online work space to produce copy for the site email joinus@unmonastery.eu for access.</li>\n\n<li>Help BUG TEST!

This is increasingly looking like it will be the first iteration of the unMonastery. A possible venue has been singled out. It is a former call center, property of the city itself: renovated, used for a few years, then abandoned again, but still in good condition. It is fully wired; the bathrooms are quite new and in good condition. It is a huge space, resulting from connecting several ancient buildings more or less embedded in each other; it is around 3000 square meters.\n\nIf this is going to happen the tentative timeline looks like this:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>End of January: Pre-call for interested parties</li>\n\n<li>February: Collaborative work on writing the exact terms of the call; on trying to converge on the perception of the most interesting problems to fix in town; on inventorying the most active local groups and finding out what they are working on and what they need; and on working out a selection procedure and an explicit social contract that applicants can sign off to.</li>\n\n<li>February 15th/March 1st: Official call for applications</li>\n\n<li>March or April: unMonastery prologue</li>\n\n<li>May 1st: Deadline for applications.</li>\n\n<li>June 1st: Successful applicants are notified.</li>\n\n<li>September 1st: Grand Opening of unMonastery Matera</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<strong>How can I get involved?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Initial Pledge - If you're super serious about joining the unMonastery we'll be putting up a pledge form on the site when it launches at the end of January.</li>\n\n<li>We're working in advance of confirmation online in the workspace email joinus@unmonastery.eu for access.</li>\n\n<li>Come to Matera - we're planning a trip to Matera in February or March to scope it out, if you'd like to come email joinus@unmonastery.eu</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThat's everything for now folks.

For concerns which we may define as out of scope, I hope we can always suggest various peer initiatives which focus on addressing them. Here creating high quality directory of peers, with <strong>clear explanation of relationship including similarities and differences</strong> comes very useful!\n\nNow from my very personal perspective, what I would see as specific to unMonastery:\n\n<strong>aim</strong>: Enable change-makers, people who work for common benefits of the society, to do their work!\n\nGreat! But noting very specific to unMonastery, I guess all of us could list at least 50 different initiatives including very Edgeryders with such aim. Let's try to narrow it futher:\n\n<strong>means</strong>: Creating coliving / coworking spaces which provide all the basic infrastructure for change-makers to do their work.\n\nThis one I see much more specific. We use simple reasoning that to work on changing the world everyone needs some basic living and working conditions. Here we can also reference <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs\">Maslow's hierarchy of needs</a>. Still I could find quite some residency based initiatives, maybe we can go even more specific:\n\n<strong>trick</strong>: Instead of getting stuck on money, securing all the needed real world assets by re-purposing currently unused ones, finding <strong>in-kind</strong> donations, using assets in collaborative way (sharing), DIY \n\nDuring \\#LOTE bar camp session in Strasbourg, we started with conversation about grants and then started imagining other ways of gaining support. In my opinion we manage ok-ish with that in Matera prototype, I can say rather good for the first try! We received, semi-renovated and furnished building plus all the utilities (water, gas, electricity, internet)  <strong>in-kind</strong>, maybe still in indirect way since not actual providers donate them :(\n\nTravel, food, personal hygiene items, drugs, entertainment etc. we still manage through monetary grant and purchases. And of course we experience turbulence worrying about future of the project and falling back in thinking 'where to get monetary grants'... We already received small donations of food and some drugs but IMO so far we don't do that well on tracking it and asking for more support in-kind...\n\nOne more aspect which I see may give more specific take on unmonastery:\n\n<strong>values</strong>: horizontal, open, participatory, transparent, green, ...?\n\nIn situation where more people working on projects would like to use infrastructure provided by unMonastery than its capacity. We can 'filter' by looking at values which interested people practice in their work. Do they stay transparent about what, how and why they work on? Can everyone can join collaboration or only people from some closed circle can play along etc.\n\nAs one of the triggers for thinking about concerns and scopes of unMonastery, I see my attempt to understand work <a href=\"/u/lois\">@Lois</a> does with <a href=\"/t/food-supply-unchained/553\">Food Supply Unchained</a>. First of all I acknowledge it as very creative and important work, as many other important projects people do in Matera and around the world! At the same time I have some doubts how well it fits what unMonastery can offer. Of course I can miss noticing many things here, but so far I see intersection mostly around small stipend allocated to Lois. I remember her couple of times visiting us in Matera, but I didn't get impression that the physical infrastructure we make available over there comes of any use for her and her work. On other hand while I really don't know how I, or some other not directly involved person, can see here contributions to Food Supply Unchained, I also can't recall (which doesn't mean that it didn't happen!) particular contributions to other activities in unMonastery. I remember that <a href=\"/u/cristiano_siri\">@Cristiano Siri</a> received some help from Lois' brother (please correct me if I confuse something) with visiting some farm. On the other hand I must say I find it bit surprising that she didn't take initiative in helping with securing food supplies for unMonastery.\n\nJust to clarify, I simply let myself thinking aloud here and most likely I miss many aspects of this collaboration. Still if connection between Lois &lt;-&gt; unMonastery (which I see very distinct from Food Supply Unchained &lt;-&gt; Edgeryders) boils down to small share of financial grant, I would propose to set such cases in a future as out of scope. Which would happen automatically anyways when we reach state of operating with close to none or at some point no finances...\n\nAs I said, most likely I miss a lot of the context here, but while I do, people who don't stay seriously involved must miss even more? Checking Lois online activity in various online collaboration spaces we use:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Edgeryders platform 0 activity: \"This person doesn't have any activity on the site yet.\"</li>\n\n<li>unMonastery mailing list - 1 email</li>\n\n<li>Trello - \"No actions in the last 30 days\"</li>\n\n<li>GDrive - 2 activities (or at least i couldn't find others...)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI guess that @matthias and @ilariadauria have more insights into developments around Food Supply Unchained. I wonder in situation when unMonastery wouldn't get into field of offering financial support, what other intersections exist?\n\nAnd once again, I don't criticize in any way what Lois works on and how she does it. I just find it unclear how unMonastery fits into this picture, assuming that we don't want to get into role of intermediary in getting financial grants where initiatives like Edgeryders and other peers can offer more support here...\n\nActually formally I understand that finances flow: Citizens of Matera -&gt; Municipality of Matera -&gt; Committee MT2019 -&gt; Edgeryders and then it goes into stipends (~1/2 of which which residents put back together into food budget) and various expenses related to unMonastery:Matera operations. Personally I would prefer if forwarding financial grands would stay as concern of Edgeryders but out of scope in unMonastery :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2014-04-20 12:15:34", "updated_at": "2019-06-22 15:15:54.804920", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1089, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22151, "user_id": 2410, "topic_id": 3945, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>+1+1 +1 +1+1 +1+1perfect</b>\n\n+1\n\n+1 +1 +1\n\n+1 +1\n\n+1\n\nperfect (but we still need a Maestro of Food)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-27 14:47:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:03.451290", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 35, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20879], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5917, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5884, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<small class=\"noclass\">Everyone, what a great mobilization!

Everyone does. Some things are programmed, life cycles, biorhythms, etc. So, my -and yours - individual perspective have these things in common. We all know we'll be hungry around 8 in the evening today, so we're planning for dinner ... : ). If you're 50 years old now, you'd expect to live some 30 years more, if you're 30 now, you'd expect some 50 years more. Ok, then you get a cute newborn kitten, and you know, she's got more or less 15-20 years to live. Then, when she dies after 18 years, you're sad, even though you knew it would happen, but you rather think: Well, she had come full circle. When an old person dies, it's sad, but it's not a tragedy. Tragedy (call it crisis, call it trauma) is something that happens against these expectations, outside of these -natural, biological - cycles. You could say it's \"disruptive\". Now, when everyone wants something disruptive to happen, we have to conclude, that he expects to benefit from this disruption.\n\nWhen we know that radioactive waste is radioactive for the next 10000 years, it would perhaps be more honest, intellectually, to say: Ok, folks, we don't know shit about the next 10000 years, but we have reason to believe that at some point, someone will come along with the ability to neutralize radioactivity (that would be the negative form of trauma, call it \"miracle\", if you like). If that's too optimistic, whishful thinking, they could say: At some point within the next 10000 years, people will be happy to die young, the world is hot and crowded and living has become unbearable, and everyone who endures more than 20 years will be looked upon with pity. (When we look at the past, dying prematurely wasn't always considered a bad thing, for example when it happened in military service, fighting for your home country, or when you were one of the chosen human sacrifices in an aztec ritual).To some degree, this is happening already: Lately, I was walking around in Lisbon and some outdoor ads caught my attention. They depicted young people with no hair (supposedly cancer patients) who were cheerful and laughing. (look at the link below) I thought, \"well if someone has cancer and is happy, that's great, for him. Why make it an advertising campaign? Are we being prepared for the future where cancer is so common that we better start looking at it like the new normal? Like having a flu?\u00a0\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n<span>http://recantoalegna.blogspot.pt/2014/02/despir-o-preconceito.html</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-28 11:31:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:35.124800", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 471, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19066, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 638, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>Amen to that</b>\n\nAgree with most everything @Natalia_Skoczylas and @Noemi are saying. The only difference is that I do appreciate that Uber/Airbnb create some value for local communities, by giving some extra freedom to people on the ground. For example, say\u00a0you notice that there is a long queue for taxis at your local airport on Friday nights.\u00a0You can then in principle step in as an Uber driver and make yourself availabe for that time slot, if you need the money more than the time. It is a market clearing mechanism, but a clearing market is, in itself, a good thing. What's bad is a market underpinned by asymmetric power relationships. But we have that anyway: taxi drivers telling people \"you can't work here, this is our turf\" is an act of violence. It is no coincidence that most Uber drivers in Brussels are\u00a0Arabs: plenty of unemployed/underemployed young Arabs in town, and\u00a0Uber lowers the threshold for them to enter the business. Without it, driving for money is off limits for them.

In short:\n\n> <a href=\"http://huis-vdh.org/\">Huis VDH</a> wants to give time and resources to people to experiment, try, fail and succeed around new models for the present and future of Brussels. We are convinced that the magic happens by connecting citizen\u2019s skills and needs. We aim to become a laboratory for urban change hosting citizens in search of anchor.\n\nBut Huis VDH doesn\u2019t fall from the sky. For me, being in good care in the city has always meant having a healthy living environment. To create such a good environment we need good city planners and a great vision on public space. Something Brussels is still lacking...\n\n\n## Once upon a time, there was public space.\n\nFrom 2012 onwards, I got fascinated by the concept of public space and how to bring it back in the center of everyday life in the city. After reading <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHU9aLPyxf0\">a call</a> by philosopher Philippe Van Parijs about the urge to design new ways to interact in public space because of the limits of private space in the city, I got involved in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=248368211944878&amp;fref=ts\">Pic Nic The Streets</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/canal.park.bxl/?fref=ts\">Canal Park BXL</a> that both asked the government to urgently work on citizen based public space to better the living conditions of each citizen. Both won the political battle, but the result wasn\u2019t really what we were hoping for. Pic Nic The Streets led to a carfree city center, but so poorly planned that a strong movement of anti carfree people could rise and are now threatening to stop  further reorganisation of the city center. Looking at the plans for the big park, we are scared that gentrification will become an even bigger issue now in the zone around Canal Park. We were hoping for an inclusive design knowing that a lot of poor people are living in that neighbourhood. Now we are continuing to work as an observer with a cargo bike installation called <a href=\"about:blank\">Canal d\u2019Accroche</a> (part of the project <a href=\"http://www.velom2.be\">V\u00e9lo M2</a>, explained <a href=\"/t/velo-m2-using-a-modular-cargo-bike-to-find-societal-challenges-and-solve-them-together/5772\">here</a>) in that neighbourhood, hoping to bring them some resilience.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fb72ae274c533e70821cf9d4b9cb3c29b507574b.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\n\n## From Maison Du People to Huis VDH, a story about citizen centred design.\n\nSince I was a guide and learned about the architect Horta and his Art Nouveau Style, I\u2019m fascinated with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_du_Peuple\">Maison Du Peuple</a>, a building from the end of the 19th century that housed all kind of projects and people wanting to better society. It was a place where ideals could grow, and people could come listen to each other in an open dialogue. I started working on an open call to repurpose the empty Bourse building into a new Maison Du Peuple, right in the hearth of the city. But just days after finishing the text the attacks in Bataclan occurred and life in Brussels changed dramatically for a couple of weeks\u2026\n\nI gave it a rest and set my focus on a vacant building above the well-known music bar <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bonnefooi/\">Bonnefooi</a>: 4 floors, 500 m\u00b2, and lots of potential, but also lots of work to be done. Without any budget or action plan, I started gathering people in the house, now called Huis VDH. The only thing I knew was that I wanted an inclusive project build from a common idea: Designing a semi-public space in such a way that the wellbeing of the neighbourhood / city improves. Huis VDH will therefore become a test case, because it isn\u2019t the first or last vacant space above a shop in Brussels: there are more than 23,000 m\u00b2 documented.\n\nSo there we were, having a space, an open concept and a lot of potential. The first thing we did was taking time to create a common practice: we designed our way of gathering through a <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/using-futurism-to-detect-the-vision-of-a-collaborative-community-in-the-making-huis-vdh-c44377a3d24d\">futurism session</a> created by <a href=\"http://fo.am\">Fo.AM</a> that allowed us to gather all ideas from each person who wanted to get involved and, like a funnel, filter only the most common. For us, it was important to make Huis VDH as open as possible, so that any new member with the right mind-set could easily become a full involved partner in the building process. After a philosophical six months, we had the sprout of an idea: Huis VDH was born.\n\nIt\u2019s all in the name, for Huis VDH it is no other. \u2018Huis\u2019 means \u2018home\u2019 in Dutch and that is what we are aiming to become for people that are drowning in a sea of complexity of city life. We try to not judge each other, but rather think solution oriented: Help out where we can, and bring the right people around the table. Our space is designed to welcome each kind of small organization working on local issues: cultural, social or technological. We try to design each space so it can be multifunctional and become a temporary rest spot for thosein search of an anchor. We believe like edgeryders: \u201c that the power of a community is bigger than the sum of all parts.\u201d\n\nOne big challenge we will be facing in the next couple of years is to use our talent to organize ourselves within crisis. Big problems are ahead and we need to build up resilience to react quickly to an ever changing surrounding. Huis VDH is trying to take that challenge inside our own development. For us resilience can be developed on four levels: knowledge, vulnerability, out of the box exercise, and modification.\n\n\n## Shared knowledge\n\nOpen Source is all around us, and also in Huis VDH. After living for 5 weeks in an open source innovation camp called<a href=\"about:blank\"> POC21</a>, I find solutions to every kind of problem through this model of thinking. Knowledge is there to be shared and if we create the right methodology we will find more easily solutions to any kind of problems. That is why we started mapping out every encounter we had through <a href=\"http://metamaps.cc/maps/1819\">metamaps</a>, we budget our work with <a href=\"http://metamaps.cc/maps/1819\">cobudget</a> and use a sharing file system inside the house.\n\n\n## Showing your vulnerable self\n\nWhen working in a collective environment, we tend to show our better self, hiding our flaws in the first place. But a strong collective group is as strong as its weakest link, and therefore we find it important that we are open and honest to each other. Having personal problems is something common, but sharing them is less. We try to create a trust field around Huis VDH where personal development is as important as the common goal of the organization. Caring about each other as a human being before seeing it as a resource for a project. In order to bring this theory into practice, we have made the first floor as cosy as possible, so people can just hang around and talk freely to each other. We make meetings short and efficient so there is time to discuss at the bar the more intimate stuff, not with all, but with whom we trust.\n\n\n## Putting ourselves outside the system\n\nIn the first six months, I was convinced we could create a complete system without the need of money. Only through exchange we could rebuild the house. This gave us a clear barrier to work around, and even if after six months we partially let money in our system, we were trained to think about solutions without money by using the skills, knowledge and resources of one another. This is one of the many ways we try to build challenges to ourselves to constantly think out of the box. When crisis occurs, we need to think and find solutions fast. Creating these exercises in a calm period will help create resilience in all members.\n\n\n## Modification as constancy\n\nFinally, another way resilience can be created is by being in a constantly changing environment. Therefore Huis VDH doesn\u2019t have fixed spaces. Every room can be rearranged to have a different use. Having this as one of the ground rules, we create a constant reality of change that makes us well trained in the art of adaptation, a virtue needed in times of crisis. In September, we will be, thanks to @Nadia, hosting the Open Care Weekend for Brussels.We see it as an opportunity to use our space for a common goal and adapt it while having people using the space. It will be our first external happening and we are really excited.\n\nWhen working for Huis VDH, I have a phrase by Bachelard that always comes to mind: \u201cOur House is our first universe, a real cosmos in every sense of the word\u201d We can\u2019t forget about the complexity of a home when we want to harmonize it. In cosmos, planets collide, new stars are born and a black hole sometimes sucks up even galaxies. This will be the same for people, ideas and principles. The most important for the wellbeing of this microcosm will be the search for constant balance.\n\nIn September we will be co-hosting the <a href=\"/t/working-out-loud-openandchange-workshops-in-thessaloniki-brussels-and-berlin/5787\">Brussels OPENandChange Workshop</a> and that will kick off our Huis VDH. In the follow up we are working on a concept called Pirate Kitchen: using the resources from dumpster diving or own grown combined with hobby cooks we want to bring each week around 10 people gravitating around the same interest / problem / field but don\u2019t know or rarely meet. We wouldn\u2019t give them any explanation about whom they will meet, only that they will have a dinner with interesting  people. They will have to find out why they are all here, and what they could bring to each other. A sort of blind date for change makers. Could this be an interesting form, or does it already occur in some places?\n\nI\u2019d appreciate any feedback in a comment below, and see you on 10-11 September for the workshop!  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n*The production of this article was supported by [Op3n Fellowships](/t/5296), an ongoing program for community contributors between May and November 2016.*", "created_at": "2016-08-08 15:40:37", "updated_at": "2019-11-21 18:57:21.316747", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1846, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 25.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 947, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 914, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/2012/01/you-the-expert-an-invitation-to-strasbourg/\">Remember our post</a> inviting community members to participate at the upcoming miniconference in Strasbourg, on the 15<sup>th</sup>-16<sup>th</sup> of March?

Stage 1 is simply seven questions in free form.</li>\n\n<li>In Stage 1 focus on highlighting the innovation part of social innovation.</li>\n\n<li>You can submit multiple ideas. And should, if you have them.</li>\n\n<li>Check out the names of the judges on the website. If you know some of them it is a good idea to write an email to the competition's address and let them know: there might be some conflict of interest. They don't make a big deal of it, but doing full disclosure is a good idea anyway.</li>\n\n<li>If you are selected as one of 30 semifinalist, you will be guided through resubmission to compete to be one of 10 finalists (get good quality mentoring) and one of 3 winners (get mentoring and 30K euro cash).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n\n<a id=\"What judges look for\" name=\"What%20judges%20look%20for\"></a>What do judges look for?</h3>\n\nNo one could ever agree just what exactly social innovation is. The jury panel represents the whole spectrum of the SocInn crowd, from Cisco (innovation\u2013 and tech-focused) all the way to social cooperatives types (focused on the ailing humanity). The European Commission's DG Enterprise adds a keenness for job creation to the mix.\n\nThree specific things:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>social.</em> You need to show you are solving a social problem (collective problems like environmental ones also ok). The socialcoop-leaning judges think in terms of \"weak groups\": which one are you targeting? The Roma? The disabled? The young-and-unemployed? I dislike compartmentalizing humanity into groups (and I dislike treating my fellow humans as passive \"targets\"), but if you do happen to think in those terms, you should definitely state clearly who your target group is.</li>\n\n<li><em>innovation.</em> You need to show what you do is innovative. In the first round of assessment, innovation will be the key criterion (unlike last year). The idea is that non-innovative projects be weeded out as early in the game as possible.</li>\n\n<li><em>job creation.</em> Most judges like it when you show your solution creates jobs.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAnd a few non-specific things:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>sustainability</em>. Where is your revenue? How are you going to stay up?</li>\n\n<li><em>scalability/replicability</em>. How are you going to go from humble beginnings to a continent-wide solution?</li>\n\n<li><em>impact and its measurement</em>.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSemifinalists are selected independently from one another. In selecting finalists and winners, judges like a certain diversity; across countries, lone hackers vs. establishe organizations, more social vs. more innovation.\n\n<h3>Matthias's 10 steps to victory</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>What is it?\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Public call for competition entries to create large-scale solutions to the unemployment crisis in Europe.</li>\n\n<li>Three first prizes of 30 000 EUR each, to be used for implementing your project (you have to be able to prove this with receipts).</li>\n\n<li>And the simplest link to remember for finding all the information: http://socialinnovationcompetition.eu/</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>yust apply, even if the idea is vague, even if it's right before the deadline.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>And by the way, the deadline is 2013-12-11 12:00 CET.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>Apply with multiple ideas in parallel (5 * 2 hours is better than 1 * 10 hours\u00a0 of effort).\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The first stage in this round is now emphasizing innovation and novelty even more, to \"find the crazy ideas\".</li>\n\n<li>Also, all the judges are from different backgrounds, and all will have their pet projects for also subjective reasons. So to increase the chance of one of your projects making it through, apply with many.</li>\n\n<li>There were 7 entries from Edgeryders in the last contest, and one has won.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>Use a good name.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Our self-ironic name (\"Economy App\", as in \"there is an app for everything, now even for the economy) was a risky thing to do. The judges were critical of the idea when hearing the name, but changed their minds after the proposal. (They probably did not get the irony, but still, maybe the provocative name got them interested.)</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>Make ideas fit to what they like.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>They like ideas that include a tech innovation (I think this is why our team did win).</li>\n\n<li>For the first stage, they now emphasize innovation over sustainability (crazy ideas over ready-made bsuiness plans). This was different in the 2013 edition, where both were (I think) weighted equally.</li>\n\n<li>Enter with scalable ideas, those that potentially can apply to all of Europe and create millions of jobs. Web based ideas are often scalable, for example. Stuff restricted to the jurisdiction of one country is less scalable, and stuff you're doing with an existing project in very specific circumstances is even less scalable.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>Make your project implementation plan as specific as possible.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>This also applies to the first stage of the submission, but is not as important there.</li>\n\n<li>If your project is still in idea stage, make and mention agreements with organizations for collaborations who agree to help you implement it in some aspect.</li>\n\n<li>If your team is not yet complete, find members for your \"extended team\" on condition of funding, basically meaning they agree to be team members in exchange for a wage that you include in your spending plan.</li>\n\n<li>It is ok if you have to adapt your specific plan after you won the competition: you do not owe European Commission obedience to your initial spending plan, you should however be able to argue why your updated plan is even better.</li>\n\n<li>Judges like to see that you are able to make specific plans, not true plans. Everyone knowing about business plans for real knows that a business plan is outdated the minute it is written ...</li>\n\n<li>If your project is still in idea stage, it is specific enough if you have a specific plan for a prototype of your idea. That was what Matthias did.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>Write the second stage application according to the rules, just better.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Use an optically tidy and pleasing template, add good formatting to the delivery plan and spending plan.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>And because you know Alberto, in addition to your application write an e-mail to prize2014@socialinnovationcompetition.eu to tell the EU Commission that you know him, so he won't judge your submissions. Else your entry might become disqualified, see the exclusion criteria.</li>\n\n<li>Let Alberto add some criteria from the judge perspective.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"#What%20judges%20look%20for\">Done that</a>!</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>(We did not actually do this in the session: shame!) Let us generate some ideas together now, and assign them to people who want to enter the competition with them.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Always say \"yes, and\" until we have a next idea.</li>\n\n<li>Let Alberto judge the ideas quickly after we generated them.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Example ideas: Small Enterprise Alibaba</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A system of direct import from small-scale producers to exploit arbitrage between market prices, cutting short through all the profit margins of the usual trade intermediaries, so that even less efficient small-scale producers can make a reasonable living in their local circumstances. For example, food prices in Romania are maybe 2 times cheaper than in Germany, and 6 times cheaper than in Switzerland.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li><strong>Example ideas: Making computers less strange to the majority of people.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>From Arthur.</li>\n\n<li>It's about helping people get online and exploiting all the job opportunities and startup enterprise options that are there, from Etsy to Fiverr to eBay and all the other stuff.</li>\n\n<li>This should also include education in English (the language of the Internet) and the basics of doing international business (shipping, customs, ...).</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n</ol>\n\nPlease help me (Alberto) put together the documentation \u2013 pinging [rhithink].\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-03 11:52:54", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:09.366999", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1534, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 80.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4998, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 4965, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Future Makers Nepal was supposed to be the big learning of my life - first time in Asia, first time working in a very different setting and for an institution as big as UNDP. It was a chance to use my multicultural experience and practice some of my scientific knowledge about politics in a real situation. Also a big challenge to try to do something meaningful in a very short time in a completely new place. I knew it will be a project that demands accelerated ability to build networks and meet the right people, and it will require extreme carefulness and respect in order not to deliver some good quality outcomes.\u00a0\n\nWhat was not calculated is that I would land in Kathmandu the day before their biggest earthquake in 80 years and that with @Matthias we would have to face a huge crisis in the country. Our original project got twisted and turned - instead of promoting participatory democracy and more transparent and inclusive ways of making politics (and writing the constitution, which was finally approved shortly after we left Nepal), we collected stories of resilience and grassroot mobilisation. We ended up being close to many small, ad-hoc activities that provided extremely efficient help to areas affected by the disaster. For three months we observed an extremely interesting society dealing with destruction, lack of organization on national and international level and various examples of inefficiency.\u00a0\n\nThe project wasn't exactly what we would like it to be - not that we really knew from the beginning what kind of role we could possibly play in such a new setting. At some point we realized that our knowledge, even if it impressed our supervisors and shed some new light on the civil society in Nepal, won't easily transfer into action and actual changes. We faced the difficulties of working within big international structures, in a highly turbulent time. Money and time constraints, also procedures, didn't allow us to implement some small projects and ideas that in our opinion could have been important and life-changing for the people in the country. Even though we managed to spot impressive examples of resilience, activism, grassroot mobilisation and innovation, there were no effective ways to engage powerful stakeholders with them.\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/t/future-makers-nepal/598\">Future Makers Nepal</a> is the reason why I decided to take lead of the development track of LOTE5 conference. I will tell you more about fuckups and failures we've witnessed and took part in ourselves during that extraordinary journey. I hope to turn this discussion into a big mutual learning process - where we compare the notes, exchange experinces and possibly come up with alternative ideas on how to get things done despite circumstances and obstacles. In the following weeks I will be announcing the first speakers who will join us in Brussels in the late February 2016 during LOTE5 - and I want to ask you to chip in your own ideas and personal stories or contacts that would nurture this debate. We want as much diverse stories from development to be included - in form of posts, interviews, and sessions during the conference.

Among the goals of the Copernicus Series is to provide young people a hands-on learning experience that is directly connected to leading-edge research in science, which is usually only available to graduate and post-graduate students.\n\nExosphere\u2019s thesis is that countless young people opt out of careers in science and technology because science education fails to expose them to the interesting applications of science to their life and the problems of the world. Furthermore, careers in science have come to be attached to a stigma concerning their earning potential, especially in traditional academia.\n\nThe mission of Exosphere\u2019s Copernicus Series is to expose youths to the exciting potential of science and prepare them for success in a quickly changing world, while helping experienced researchers commercialize and profit from their innovations through entrepreneurship. Through this process, the program will serve as an ongoing, productive platform for building the requisite brain trust of experts and practitioners in academia and industry to provide the resources and know-how necessary for further development of space related technology into commercializable endeavors while advancing space research and raising awareness for space exploration.\n\n<strong>OBJECTIVES</strong>\n\nThe goal of the program is to design, build, and test virtual models and software libraries that model the technical development and surrounding economic environment of an Endogenously-Powered Space Elevator, which would utilize the energy generated by gravity using materials brought back to earth by space mining companies. This process would create an electrical loop, allowing satellites, scientific equipment, and other materials to be taken to space at near zero marginal cost. Split into two teams, the Technical Team and the Economics Team, the participants will further build mathematical models for an architecture capable of delivering these payloads into orbit.\n\nSpace mining companies will, in the near future, be delivering payloads from space back to earth, providing enormous quantities of potential \u201cfuel\u201d in the form of work done by the gravity of the falling payload. The thesis to be tested and developed by participants in Copernicus is that this energy can be harnessed using an electromagnetic drive to lift up payloads from earth.\n\nThe original concept for the Zero Energy Space Elevator actually comes to us from antiquity, when Roman scientists considered building an aqueduct harnessing the potential energy of falling rocks to move water upward. The Roman joke was that this \u201cperpetual drive\u201d will work until mountain ceases to be a mountain. Our objective is, among others, to deliver a payload to space in an economically viable way in cooperation with a space mining company, catalyzing the space exploration revolution, which today is held back almost singularly by the cost of catapulting payloads out of earth\u2019s atmosphere using expensive rocket fuel.\n\nThe current concept of the space elevator includes a tether stretching from the surface of the Earth to geostationary orbit. To keep the tether taut with gravitational and rotational forces, the center of mass of the space elevator has to be kept above this orbit. A climber is attached to the tether, which carries the payload up to the space station or to a satellite. The energy supply in our hypothesis would be derived from the falling mass using electromagnetics or other potential mechanisms, making our hypothetical model bi-directional instead of uni-directional, as are most existing models. As there are multiple possibilities for achieving this, part of the challenge presented to participants of Copernicus is to model each possibility and analyse both the technical and economic benefits and challenges of each.\n\nAt the end of the program the participants will attempt to integrate the physical and economic models of the EPSE into a dynamic mathematical model using mechatronics concepts. Building on the results of this work, participants will write a final paper to be submitted to Open Access journals and scientific conferences.\n\nMoritz Bierling, Copernicus Program Manager\n\nE-Mail: moritz@exosphe.re\n\nSkype: bierlingm\n\nMobile: +56 9 8760 1666\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-21 12:40:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:01.950114", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 750, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 45.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2334], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22087, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4250, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>I agree!</b>\n\nYes, I see that we have WP5 for learning and WP6 for management, I agree WP0 is sexier.. but no idea how relevant numbering is.\n\nQuick notes from looking at the WPs spreadsheet: tasks and numbering don't exactly correspond to the tasks some of us budgeted for - see WP4 in Tasks and WP4 in LaBRI Budget- \u00a0differences appear, not sure if this is crucial since the budget will be atomized by we do need consistency because in each WP description in the proposal you need to detail your activities, and then when aggregating we need to look at 1 sheet and get everything from there -<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uMYnZE8yZKaguA0X8PyDbHfL-hYCoraOoR1r2tOgkvU/edit#gid=1857394836\"> Tasks</a>.\n\nSame with ER, but I moved all communication and dissemination tasks in WP5 to be consistent with the budget sheet Alberto re-made.\n\nShould perhaps WeMake also move all their 2.3 Communication activities in WP5, for consistency? ping <a href=\"/u/cristina_martellosio\">@Cristina_Martellosio</a>.\n\nTrying to look at all our events to make sure we don't overcommit:\n\nWP4: 2 data driven workshops (LaBRI)\n\nWP5: 3 onboarding workshops (ER)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3 co-design workshops (WeMake and Milano)\n\nWP6: 4 consortium meetings (everyone)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-28 11:12:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:03.035473", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 230, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20670], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17099, "user_id": 2330, "topic_id": 4979, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Edgefuckup</b>\n\nIndeed.

Someone who walks the blade taking risks in trying out innovative solutions to common problems, that there is no guarantee will succeed. There are different kinds of edgeryders, and we take on different roles in the world depending on our values, personalities, interests and skillsets. Edge-riding as a metaphor comes from extreme sports but <a href=\"http://thrivable.net/2009/08/edge-riding/\">Jean Russels post</a> is a good description of what we mean by it. We\u2019re looking for a logo that coveys this in an elegant (simple) way, preferebly using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram\">tanagrams</a>.\n\n<strong>Project background:</strong> Edgeryders is a joint project of the Council of Europe and the European Commission. It is meant as a diverse, constructive interaction channel between European young people and their democratic institutions, and designed along the principle of Internet-enabled massive open collaboration. Its goal is to produce a shared vision of how Europe\u2019s young citizens could claim a stronger influence on our common future \u2013 and a larger share of the social responsibility that goes with it. Young people tend to be excluded from labour markets; let down by an education system that seems not to be able to help them achieve full autonomy; estranged from traditional political participation channels; too often marginalised and stigmatised into a social problem themselves. Yet, this same generation displays brilliant examples of creativity, social innovativeness, attitude for collaboration and sharing and generosity. By making use of these abilities, many young people are building new ways to make the transition from adolescence to a full-fledged adult life; they are effectively building the world we all will live in tomorrow. Edgeryders aims to engage them, and every person of any age who is interested in collaborating, in building a shared vision of how we, as a society, could work together to achieve this transition for everybody. The results of the exercise will be presented to the European Commission and the Council of Europe\u2019s member states in a conference to take place in June 2012.\n\n<strong>Rules:</strong> We are in the space of creating <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons\">commons</a>.

It was a real pleasure to actually see a living, functioning unMonastery after almost 20 months since concept. There are plenty of glitches, but glitches were budgeted for, and overall I think it is working very well. I hope to have time for deeper reflections in the coming future.\u00a0\n\nOne thing that is very clear looking at the unMonastery Matera from my vantage point is that starting an unMonastery is venturing into the unknown unknown. unMonasterians simply have to make it up as they go; there is no telling where the next glitch is going to come from. Things that \"just happen\" turn out to be a tremendous boon (everyone was super-impressed with [elf Pavlik]'s open data program); others that are rolled out thoughtfully and with the best intentions turn sour.\u00a0\n\nHere's a small incident that brought this home to me. On grandopening day, unMonasterians put up a big \"Welcome\" sign (shown below). This was appreciated, but when they did not take it down the day after, I am told, people started to moan. My source for this is Paolo, MT2019's director: and I believe him, because Materans are very particular about the visual consistency of their city. Things like colors of the shutters are heavily regulated; satellite dishes and even solar panels are forbidden on aesthetic grounds; people hate a concrete bridge recently built in the Sassi to allow people with reduced mobility some access, however limited. This sounds crazy, and maybe it is, but is by no means limited to Matera: Italy is a country in which environmentalists oppose wind turbines because \"they deface the landscape \u2013 there was a <a href=\"http://community.matera-basilicata2019.it/content/pale-eoliche-nei-pressi-di-matera-cosa-possiamo-fare\">heated discussion</a> on this on the Matera 2019 online community, and I had to back off when one of the participants stated \"they'll have to kill him\" to install turbines in the Parco della Murgia!\n\nDifferent aesthetic preferences per se are not generally divisive, but in the case of an unMonastery \u2013 manned as it is by people from outside the area \u2013 they can mean two things, not mutually exclusive:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\"we are here now, and we have a right to look the way we like, even if you don't like it.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"we are similar to [some other group that happens to have a similar aesthetic interface]\"</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe first statement is self-explanatory. The second needs to be qualified: in the Materan context (and the Italian context in general) this sort of aesthetics typically connotes squat spaces \u2013 there is one in Matera, a stone's throw from the unMonastery, called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Le-Fucine-dell-ECO/222666431183982\">Le Fucine dell'Eco</a>. The unMonastery is most definitely not a squat \u2013 we fought hard to build a social role for unMonasterians as community troubleshooters, for the very good reason that if the unMonastery is not perceived as serving the community nobody will talk to it, and it will soon wither and die.\u00a0\n\nSo I am curious: is Paolo right here? is the unMonastery's visual identity serving it purpose as a smooth intrface withthe local community? What do [Rita O], [antonioelettrico], [andrea.paoletti] and the other Materans in the group think?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-22 21:49:05", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 06:05:15.172920", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 590, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1672], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5562, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5529, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/46acbe6a2dee3e84ed6f9773bcb581ff39e5a839.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n\u00a0\n\nCirca 25 students at <a href=\"/t/hacking-utopia-opencare-for-social-and-democratic-change-a-new-product-design-course-at-udk/5486\">Berlin University of the Arts</a> are now pioneers of Op3n Care.

This is not just about Germany, where most of their experiences are situated, but rather more widespread. As we surface different shades resistance to newcomers, the questions that seem to guide how we design interventions or services are: what fosters empathy and can we speed it up through designing better ways for human connection; though hacking habits of cultures creatively? and who should we even design for?\n\nAgain what is foreign hurts.

Two Nurses realized that, despite there being many medical and social organizations in Brussels (Belgium), there were still a great number of homeless people in the Belgian capital. They noticed that personal care and health were major issues for homeless people and were convinced that they could solve these problems.\n\nThe organization has three primary goals: field work, trainings and tools.\n\nField work: Street Nurses takes to the streets to meet patients directly in their environment, without asking for payment. We take care of them, earning their trust, and we motivate them to take charge of their personal care and health by accompanying them to specific care facilities, by actively listening to their needs and giving them advice.\n\nOur work is also based on prevention and the dissemination of health information. We are medical and social intermediaries between, on the one hand, persons who live in an extremely precarious situation and on the other, healthcare professionals and social workers.\n\nThe follow-up of patients ends with the integration of the patient in accommodation where he or she is regularly supported by professionals and volunteers of Street Nurses, and a network of social associations.\n\nWe aim to assist persons who live in extremely precarious situations by offering them a home and by permanently reintegrating them into society. This medium- to long-term goal is achieved by improving the living conditions and the hygiene of these individuals, as well as their self-esteem.\n\nTrainings: Street Nurses organizes different types of awareness-raising sessions and training courses in French or Dutch on \u2018hygiene and precariousness\u2019 and \u2018basic first aid\u2019.\u00a0 These trainings are address to any target group that is likely to come into direct contact with homeless people or that works with people who live at home and have major hygiene issues. Our nurses organize sessions on site \u2013 in schools, in the offices of security guards and social workers, clinics etc.\n\nTools: Street Nurses develops prevention tools and information packages to raise awareness among homeless persons about the importance of personal care and health, to give them better access to care and to facilitate their medium - to long-term rehabilitation. Certain tools, however, are aimed at raising awareness among the general public about the situation of homeless people. Examples: list of showers in Brussels, map of fountains and free public conveniences, symptoms and interventions in case of hypothermia, Frostbite prevention poster, Heat stroke prevention poster\n\nSince 2005 the non-profit organization Street nurses has grown and its projects are continuously developed. Today, Street Nurses has the equivalent of 13,84 full-time staff members and approximately 60 volunteers.\n\nWe saw the call by the Mac Arthur Foundation too, but we tough we were way to small to try and get it so we were very happy to receive the information trough DoucheFLux that this kind of initiative exists. We are mostly organized to search every year for new funds. We try to find the good balance between private, public and foundation funds but because of our high costs of wages it is difficult to fund foundations that are willing to support us. Most of them give only money for material or structural projects, not for day to day tasks, and that is what Street Nurses is all about.\n\nSince a couple of years we opened our work to an even more inclusive service. We have a collaboration going on with Social housing agencies in Brussels to try to give homeless people a decent home at the end. We participate to the program Housing First Brussels.\n\nWe have a good network within the association field in Brussels, but when we go to specific funds we are not transcribed in their goals. For example, they help by giving furniture for kids, or funds for kid projects. But our main audience, people living on the street between 8 and 20 years is often forgotten.\n\nSomething rather unique in the social field is that we have one of our colleagues that is paid by two different organizations, ours and another non-profit organization. This makes it possible to create a solid bridge between both organizations and have a great information flow. We think there is bright future is this way of work.\n\nFinally we organize a colloquium the 20<sup>th</sup> of October in Brussels that has as goal to eradicate homelessness in Brussels for ever. With the mindset: if even we can find homes for the most difficult audience, you can too! We want to share our experience in the field. It takes time and dedication for each of our people to do the whole process, from getting the confidence, to willing to have a stable home. But we want to show that the hard work also has direct results, and if we rally our forces we can go for a total abolishment of homelessness in Brussels!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-28 11:07:52", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 08:12:01.799159", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 883, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 47.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4262], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29555, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 2522, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>ok :)</b>\n\nok, let's do it at 4pm :) I'll set the time in the event.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-02-17 19:19:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:42.701824", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29094], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14595, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 6103, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Native English speaker</b>\n\nReporting for duty.

We follow this strategy internally in our organisation as well: test lots of things in a small cheap way, evaluate,\u00a0scale, evaluate and so on. In my city this is done sometimes, like with the <a href=\"http://www.leefstraat.be/en/\">Living Streets</a>\u00a0project. The city was cooperative enough to let them test the idea. These are exceptions sadly.\n\nI've been to a few city organised or backed 'workshops' meant to shape the future of the city. The workshops\u00a0all lack\u00a0the same: citizens present. Generally, they\u00a0are organised during working hours and the only participants are civil servants and companies/entrepreneurs that have an economic\u00a0stake in the issue. The details of how these workshops go, are pathetic. And it's packaged and sold to the citizens as 'co-creation'. Last one was most striking. A workshop on urban planning,\u00a0commissioned by the city and organised by the same organisations that were involved in an ongoing massive real estate scandal. The workshop itself featured only entrepreneurs and project developers, talking about matters that affect everyone.\u00a0Already at this basic level, the city fails. How can anything good come from such a basis?\n\nMaybe this is how at least a little good can come from it. Our city has an image of being progressive and there are lots of projects that prove this. In the end however, politicians mainly want to get re-elected or get a better position next term. This means they need to live up to public expectations and produce impact in the short term. The fact that people here expect politicians to be more progressive, means the politician's\u00a0output will have to be\u00a0more progressive in order to make a career. As a result we have a pretty awesome city.\u00a0However,\u00a0it's a sugary coating that\u00a0hides the broken way in\u00a0which we are governed.\n\nI've been advised by a project coordinator to stay away from help from the city. She described it like this: if we were to receive support from the educational department under politician x from party a, next term all support could be gone under politician y\u00a0from party b. Because politician y needs to have their own projects for their curriculum, so the limited means need to go towards launching new initiatives from scratch under their term. Also, draining a project from a political opponent diminishes that opponent's credibility. This is such a waste on so many levels: money, knowledge, time, ... Not to mention the competitive atmosphere this actually creates between projects that otherwise share a similar purpose.\n\nMy own experience:\u00a0I contacted the city anyway a few months back. I mailed with the responsible politician and she directed me to the civil servant at the bottom of the 'food chain'. We met, she was impressed by our project and clearly wanted to help. She promised me to take the message back up the food chain, but assured me it would take a while, and keep me updated along the way. The department got restructured, so this was slowing things down.\u00a0Fast forward 2 months, no news, and our project is already in a different stage. Time flows differently for the government,\u00a0I hope people\u00a0age\u00a0slower as a perk for working there.\n\nA government\u00a0platform for projects to grow at their own speed would be a major improvement. De-coupling this platform from political incentives is a priority.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-04 17:38:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:39.423101", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 656, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27810], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26191, "user_id": 196, "topic_id": 1132, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>I AM COMING</b>\n\nI wanted to go visiti Unmonastery and this is the perfect opportunity!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-06 14:13:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:25.222215", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3696, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3663, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<ul>\n\n<li>more travel grants up for grabs (5 to 10)!

We need to not get too close to the corporate communications with the unMonastery visual narrative.\u00a0 The approach towards design, production and use of unMonastery wearable artefacts I feel is more in the domain of functional art than tech event swag. Plus I despise the startup rhetoric and don't want the unMonastery to be associated with that culture.\n\nI also agree with Alberto that there ought to be some kind of visually distinct and easily identifiable garb. I just don't think something \"good\" enough can be developed for the event. Rather I would use produce booklets/Nametags similar to the ones we produced for the futures knowlab with different colour stickers on them for particiapants, session leaders, etc. It worked very well for the knowlab and also solved a lot of practical problems (schedules, where stuff is happening, session information, important contact info, participant bios etc). We have the design but would need help with producing the print file to send to the printers.\n\nI think it is important to remember what it is we are doing, why we are doing it and the spirit with which it was initiated: building infrastructure to support alternative responses to systemic crises, p2p.\u00a0 And collaboratively creating the means for more people to be able to access and build on it.\n\nThat infrastructure is technosocial. The unMonastery is one part of that infrastructure. However it would not even have happened had we not created the other infrastructure on which it and other projects rely. Creating the conditions for this unMonastery prototype to even happen before most of the people in this thread came into the picture took a huge amount of effort from some people, and small efforts from many generous individuals.\u00a0\n\nWithout those contributions we would not even be having this conversation about T-shirts or anything else unMonastery related. That infrastructure is a platform and shared commitment to build sociotechnical infrastructure that makes us stronger and more capable by enabling us to collaborate and learn from one another, p2p, across the globe.\u00a0 Pooling, growing and making knowledge, tools, contacts, skills, collaboration and resources accessible to people all over the planet. Not just a priveledged few who can travel with ease all over Europe.\n\nI would have loved to have had 1-4 month residency with a bursary to work on using some of my training as an engineer on one of the challenges, doing something meaningful. But others did not do the boring, unpaid, often unseen work to create that opportunity for me\u00a0 to make use of. Or put their personal professional credibility and trusted relationships on the line for that to happen.\n\nThis work that for most only makes sense to contribute if we feel we are part of building something together, as a community. Your dismissing those people as \"nameless members of a 2000+ platform\" is both disrespectful and counterproductive if you want to see the unMonastery idea spread, thrive and develop as common infrastructure built by and accessible to many more people.\n\nI would ask that we reframe this discussion towards thinking about how we can use artefacts to make people meaningfully feel part of a shared whole, not how to keep some inside and some out.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-29 23:38:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.776649", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 618, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4895, "user_id": 2394, "topic_id": 4862, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Almost exactly a month ago I explained, as far as I'm able, Edgeryders and <a href=\"/en/lote4/welcome-to-lote4\">LOTE4</a>\u00a0at an event organised for Forum for the Future. Several interesting things came up so I'm writing them up here.\n\nNo matter what I said, everyone took me to be representing Edgeryders, which felt slightly disingenuous since so many people are so much more involved than I am. I presented to about 30 people along with Alex Soskin, at Hub Westminster, which Alex runs. The audience had been on a walking tour of Unilever Foundry and Makerversity and I think some other totemic reifications of innovation.\u00a0\n\nI wouldn't say it felt out-and-out corporate, but Alex's presentation made more than passing reference to returns-on-investments and definitely detoured out of my comfort zone and into accountancy, and from the guest list I could see there were representatives from well know purveyors of fast moving consumer goods. More than I really intended, I painted LOTE as the opposite of that, laying slightly accidental emphasis on its more quixotic aspects. Or perhaps I just wanted to stir people up a bit, whatever the case I was a bit surprised at how a room that I thought might take the opportunity to look down its nose\u00a0actually lapped it up (which are similar gestures now I think about it) - the more radical it sounded the more ticked their boxes.\u00a0\n\nThere was some discussion of how the Edgeryders organisation can run without strictly defined structures, which I responded to by pointing out that social norms trump structures, and Edgeryders has plenty of those. \u00a0I also meanderingly extemporised about the conceptual purity of LOTE; I suggested the whole project has an endearing and persuasive experimental edge that makes you want to get on board - it's precarity testament to its novelty.\n\nWhich links neatly with a more prosaic observation from Alex about his experience with Hub Westminster, where I coincidentally 'co-worked' for about a year. I let slip that I may have occasionally been in for more than two days a week, even though that was strictly all I'd paid for. He pointed out that when the desk space was not at capacity people did occasionally take the odd liberty, but, as the space filled up residents felt a moral obligation to more strictly hold themselves to their allotted days - even though as far as I know there was no easy mechanism to enforce this. This is exactly an example of social norms overriding the rules.\n\nThen Forum for the Future gave a presentation which really reinforced to me how <em>fashionable\u00a0</em>all this stuff is, where I'm not even sure what 'this stuff' means.

Yesterday, the designers of <a href=\"/en/node/7847\">ResCure</a> arrived, the first group \"in residence\" that will live here till june 25th and accelerate their project thanks to WeMake know-how and its shared spaces.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/WmLTLav3zWw\n\nThere are many people around now, many machines and tables too; there is not a fixed way to deal with spaces. At least, functionality and results make spaces lived by people and changed time to time. Some machines are heavy, but I have seen the 3D printers and other stuff moved easily from one side of the place to the other, or more tables mounted for the newcomers in few minutes. There are also many classes and participants around; so many tables, activities, computers, cables and..of course, people. There is a heterogeneity at work that makes such peculiar activities possible;\u00a0 half way instructional, half way productive. When it comes to prototyping, mocking-up, or discussing how to define something that is not standard, or mass produced, there is an involvement on different levels and by different actors. It reminds more of a home life than a factory; there are no written rules about how to deal with spaces and home rules as well, as far as I have understood. Anyway everything seems very well organised and scheduled: MIR guests arrived yesterday, but had already two classes: one about <a href=\"http://agilemethodology.org/\">AGILE</a> approach by @alessandro_contini and one about Github by @Costantino .\n\nIt is important that everybody here uses and delivers contents using the same tools and integrating to others within the bigger tasks. Me too, i had to live this \"rite of passage\".\n\nThere are two considerations now. First, big changes in constituted order of space may bring changes in the way work is organised. Second, there is not a better way than changing the program, or modifying the <font color=\"#000080\"><span><u><a href=\"http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszaxc/work/IEOS06.pdf\">shopfloor</a></u></span></font>, to see how people react and enact in other ways, de-routinizing the ethnomethods shared at WeMake and whoever may access its social world.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/944a64d78baeb1fedfa8890ccb9da818df88474b.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe arrival of ResCure-ers brings opencare work at WeMake to a new level.

Step: Incorporate</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-1\">1.1. Preparations</h3>\n\n1. **Budget for time and effort.** In theory, starting a company through the Estonian e-residency scheme is fast and low-effort. In practice, it takes time and effort. You are, after all, dealing with a completely new (to you) legal system.  Estonian professionals are still getting up to speed with e-residency: expect glitches and misunderstandings. For us, doing it was one of those important-not-urgent things. We chose to do it on the side, with low- to no disruption of our day-by-day.  It took us about 8 months to go from decision to foundation, and another two months to get the bank account up. We spent about 1,500 EUR, including one year of assistance but excluding the e-residency charges themselves and one trip to Tallinn.</li>\n\n2. **Take some time to understand the e-residency scheme.** It's a novel concept, and many people misunderstand it. The main things you need to know:\n\n    * e-residency is a government-guaranteed digital identity scheme. Through it, e-residents can access Estonian online services such as company foundation, banking, taxation. They can also sign documents and contracts.\n    * e-residency does not give you the right to enter Estonia, or live in it.\n    * e-residents do not pay personal income tax in Estonia, but in their country of physical residence.\n    * e-residency is quite well documented (starting a company through it, not so much). [The official website](https://e-estonia.com/e-residents/about/) is a good place to start.\n\n3. **Seek help.** Establishing a legal entity is useless unless you can use it to do actual business. As a foreigner, Estonia's rules and regulation will look alien to you. Also, any company needs a physical legal address in Estonia, and PO boxes are not allowed. [Here](https://e-residency.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205207022-Getting-an-Estonian-Address) is a list of business service providers you can hire to assist you and provide you with an address. If you are starting a one-man business, our Estonian friends recommend [Leapin](https://www.leapin.eu/). Anything else will need an accountant: we are small and simple, but Leapin turned us down saying our needs are too sophisticated for their offer. Our accountant is [e-Advisors](http://www.incorporate.ee/) (formerly Witismann and Partners), in Tallinn. They have been very patient and helpful. If you contact them, please mention us.\n\n4. **Beware KYC.** The Estonian government is committed to fast, frictionless online services. But Estonia still has international obligations to watch out for money laundering operations. In practice, banks and accountants need you to prove your identity and residency before they can take you on as a customer. This process is called Know Your Customer (KYC). Consequences for you: paperwork, with literal paper implied. This was the single most frustrating part of our experience of incorporating in Estonia. Since we incorporated, the situation has further worsened, and is threatening the whole scheme.\n\n    * At the time of writing, banks in Estonia insist on a visit to one of their branches in person. [This should change](https://e-estonia.com/estonian-draft-legislation-will-allow-e-residents-to-open-a-bank-account-without-going-to-a-bank-branch/), so check back on it. Every person who wants to be a user of online banking needs to visit. Our provisional solution: one of us flew to Tallinn, opened the account and got login credentials for the online banking. This makes us operational. We will add other users later.\n    * All partners had to go through KYC with the accountant, but here you can do it in remote. We tried several solutions \u2013 all bad, because this is bureaucracy at its most dreadful. The least bad we found is this:\n    * Authenticate a (paper) photocopy of your passport at an Estonian embassy (see below).\n    * Get a utility bill in English (or Russian or Estonian \u2013 good luck with that). If this is not possible, ask your bank to write you a letter in English certifying that you have a personal account there. Make sure it shows your physical address.\n    * Send your accountant the authenticated copy of the passport and the original of the bill/bank letter.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-2\">1.2. Execution</h3>\n\n1. **Get e-residency.** All partners in the company need to become e-residents. For practical reasons, it's best to also have anyone you want on the management board to do so. Application is online and very simple, and costs 100 EUR. Once it comes through, every e-resident needs to collect her physical e-residency card in person.  Cards are not mailed, and you are not allowed to send someone else in your place. You can do this either in Tallinn or at Estonian diplomatic representations. This can be an inconvenience, because Estonia is a small country with relatively few embassies around the world ([list of Estonian diplomatic missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_of_Estonia)). If you do not have one of them near, get your KYC obligations out of the way on the same day as you pick up your card.  We recommend you make 2-3 copies of your passport and get them authenticated by them while you are there. In Brussels this service is by appointment, and it costs 30 EUR per copy. Also ask the accountant if they insist on other authenticated documents, then get all the authentications done in one visit.\n\n2. **Install, test and debug the software and the hardware.** E-residency cards communicate with your computer via a card reader and some software. You should not expect this to Just Work. Take time to install, test and debug. For all its pathfinding ambitions, the Estonian government is still a government, and so it runs mostly on Windows. Mac users should restart their computers before attempting to do anything with e-residency cards. Linux users should do the same, and also look at the [improved installation instructions](https://askubuntu.com/a/883764) that @matthias wrote. The cards come with cheap card readers. In general, these work, but I already had to replace mine. Pro tip: the [e-residency help desk](http://id.ee/index.php?id=30466) is really great and very responsive, via email or phone.\n\n3. **Incorporate.** You can do this through the [Company registration portal](https://ettevotjaportaal.rik.ee/index.py?chlang=eng). The way we did it: we set up a Skype meeting with the accountant, and they guided us step-by-step. There are three steps. \n\n    * One person fills a form called a \"petition\". This is a request to the government to authorise the establishment of the new company.\n    * Each shareholder needs to digitally sign the petition. You can save the process at any time in case one of the partners struggles with the tech. The last partner to sign sends the petition to the relevant authority by pressing a button on the site.\n    * Pay a tax (at the moment 190 EUR). If you are working with an Estonian accountant (as you should), they take care of this for you. A few days later the government informs you that your company is now live, and you receive a registry number.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Step: Get a bank account</h2>\n\nAs of 2017-05-26, [Holvi](https://about.holvi.com/e-residents/) offers opening a bank account without a visit to Estonia to some categories of e-residents. We did not try this as it was not introduced when we opened our bank account, and with most other banks a visit to the branch in Estonia is still mandatory for every user who will get access to the bank account. However, legislation to relax this constraint [has been developed](https://e-estonia.com/estonian-draft-legislation-will-allow-e-residents-to-open-a-bank-account-without-going-to-a-bank-branch/) in Estonia and is now in place.\n\nThe banks supporting the e-residency scheme are LHV, SEB and Swedbank (according to [this article](https://e-residency.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205283551-a), but it seems outdated now as they do not mention Holvi for example). Before you apply to one of them, make sure you have a business plan ready. They will ask you questions: how much money do you think you will receive? From which countries? What are your estimates based on? Where is your money going to come from? Your accountant can help you smooth things out. In our case, I think it helped a lot that I sent them a recent profit-and-loss statement downloaded from our cloud accounting platform.\n\nWe bank with [LHV Bank](https://www.lhv.ee/en/). Our Estonian friends recommend it, because it is the only Estonian bank currently in this game, so it is the fastest to adopt government innovations as they come through. But it seems all banks in Estonia offer very competitive conditions and good service. UPDATE 2018-12-20:  **however, LHV has a major problem: no correspondent bank in the USA means you cannot receive wire transfers in US dollars**. This is not a showstopper if you do business with the private sector (you can use Transferwise, or simply ask your client to pay you in EUR). With us, it's more of a problem. We have not yet solved this, and are looking into several solutions. Both SEB and Swedbank have turned us down in the light of stiffening KYC policies.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Step: Register for VAT</h2>\n\nEstonia has very low ceilings for operating without a VAT registration, so you will need to do this soon. Beware: whatever your turnover, you are not allowed to file quarterly returns for VAT. VAT is always monthly. To register:\n\n1. Go to [this page](https://www.emta.ee/eng/business-client/registration-business/registration-person-liable-value-added-tax) of the Tax and Customs Board's website. Download the PDF form called \"Application for registration as a person liable to VAT\".\n\n2. Enter the relevant information, sign the file digitally and e-mail it to the to the TCB ([kmkr@emta.ee](mailto:kmkr@emta.ee)). Processing takes about a week.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Step: Change your articles of association (optional)</h2>\n\nWhen you incorporate, the E-Registry portal generates standard articles of association for you. You have no way to customise them. But you can do it after incorporation, as often as you want, whenever you want to. There is no need to go through a notary, and if all management board members have E-ID cards, this can be processed online. The process is as follows:\n\n1. Download your own articles of association from the [e-Business register](https://ariregister.rik.ee/index?lang=eng). To do that, access your company's record (for example by searching for it). Then select \"Documents in the business file\" from the \"Choose information\" drop-down menu. Then add to cart and pay (2 EUR) to download the files. Two of them are the articles of association, in Estonian (pohikiri) and English.\n\n2. Make the changes you need in the English version.\n\n3. Get the changes translated into Estonian. Articles of association have to be in Estonian, sorry. The articles of association have to be in Estonian. It was suggested we add an article saying we also provide an English translation for convenience, a sort of appendix.\n\n4. Create a PDF out of the new Estonian Articles of Association.\n\n5. Any management board member then logs into the [Company Registration Portal](https://ettevotjaportaal.rik.ee). Click \"Submission of application\", then \"Changing the data of an enterprise \" and choose the name of your company to access the company's records.\n\n6. In the page that opens, click on the button \"Start the petition for an entry regarding alteration\". You are taken to a page where you can later any data of the company. Click on \"Alter the articles of association\".\n\n7. From the page that opens, click on \"Add new articles of association\". Choose \"Add the articles of association as a file\", then select \"The articles of association of a private limited company shall **not** set out different types of shares and / or special rights\". Select the PDF you have created above and choose a date of approval; next click on the blue button \"+ Add the articles of association as a file\".\n\n8. At this point you have created a petition, like the one you created for incorporation. Next, all shareholders will then need to login into the [Company Registration Portal](https://ettevotjaportaal.rik.ee) and sign the petition digitally. Once they all have done it, the petition is processed by the government service in charge of this stuff.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Questions and answers</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-1\">5.1. How to add shareholders?</h3>\n\nNew shareholders may be included in many ways, please find an overview of the main options as follows:\n\n1. The existing shareholder divides his / her share and transfers a part of his/her share to the new shareholder. All share transaction has to be certified by a notary (if the shares are not registered with the Estonian Central Register of Securities). We can represent the seller and the buyer in the notary based on the certified (and apostilled/legalised) power of attorney. If the existing shareholder is married and the share constitutes joint property, the husband and wife have to come to the notary. All other shareholders have a pre-emption right, thus they should grant their consent to the sales transaction.\n\n2. The company issues new shares to the new shareholders. This option presumes that the existing shareholders pay the share capital in full. As described in the previous section, the existing shareholders have a pre-emptive right. The increase of the share capital can be processed online if all related persons have e-residency card.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-2\">5.2. How can shareholders appoint and revoke management board members?</h3>\n\nIf all related persons (shareholders and the new member of the management board) have e-residence card, there is no need for a notary appointment.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-3\">5.3. Can an Estonian O\u00dc be a not-for-profit?</h3>\n\nYes. Edgeryders O\u00dc is now, we simply had to change our articles of association for that.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-4\">5.4. Can an Estonian company deduct expenses not directly related to profit making?</h3>\n\nYes, though you need to be able to argue that the expense furthers the goals of the company in the long run. \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-5\">5.5. Can an Estonian company deduct charitable donations from corporate taxes?</h3>\n\nAs a general principle, no. However, there are exceptions, with limits and threshold.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--5-6\">5.6.

Not just a specific boss, but all of\u00a0them, <em>permanently</em>.</strong>\n\nIt was about power. It was not about money, it was about power. I'd\u00a0begun to understand that, at a profound level, the goals of the\u00a0market, the goals of capitalism, were directly opposed to my own\u00a0personal goals for my life and the world, at least in most cases.\n\nI realized, in particular, that a huge part of the wealth in our\u00a0societies was coming from one of three places:<span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<ol style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 2em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; list-style-type: decimal; \">\n\n<li>stealing from the\u00a0future,<span>\u00a0</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>destroying nature, or</li>\n\n<li>subjugating the poor.<span>\u00a0</span>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nI was about 30 at\u00a0the time, searching for meaning and purpose, but I knew from the way I\u00a0felt interacting with my corporate superiors, working on projects that\u00a0I did not care about, that there was A Problem. I knew that <strong>The\u00a0Problem</strong> went beyond the surface, beyond a specific interaction with a\u00a0specific boss, and into the experience of Work itself, within the\u00a0context of late-stage Capitalism.\n\nSo I quit. It was easy. I was moving across country, taking a new\u00a0role, and everything went wrong over a period of months. And at the\u00a0end of it, I just said \"<strong>enough</strong>\", and that was it. It was like the way I once became vegetarian. I just had a moment of realization, changed my ideas, and stopped eating meat for six years. The decisions I made around money felt the same way, the same sense of an <strong>insight which meant I had to change my way of life</strong>. So I did.\n\nI thought, at first, that being my own boss would be the answer, that I could be a contractor. But what I discovered is that being a boss to myself was not the a solution. Being a boss is a position where one stands over another, and gives orders. And if I decided to be a boss to myself, all I'd achieved was<strong> internalizing the oppressor</strong>. My client (I used to build web sites) became The Market, I became The Boss, ordering myself around on their behalf and - frankly - I worked harder than ever, with more freedom, but with my own ever-present supervision. <strong>Was that freedom at all?</strong> There's no slacking off for an afternoon, when you are your own supervisor. Being your own boss is not the answer, any more than never breaking a bad law because you constantly monitor your own behavior is the answer to living in a country with unfair rules. It's just moving the position from which you are controlled from the outside to the inside. It's change, but not necessarily improvement.\n\nSo I thought again. What I resented, fundamentally, was having my energy diverted from solving the world's problems to making money for myself, and turning the great global wheels of Capitalism. I felt it was, in some sense, a double sin because I am mighty when I'm well aligned, and weak when I'm out of balance with myself, so when I was working on things I did not want to work on, squandering my energy turning the wheels of the machine rather than finding a future for all of us, it also massively cut my effectiveness as a researcher and a thinker in my own time. I found I could not serve two masters, the market and myself. <strong>So I chose to do it my way, and tell The Market to get stuffed.</strong>\n\n<strong>I dug in. I got used to poverty, and I made a critical change: I started to refuse to take money for doing anything I would not be willing to do for free. I would not sell either my labor or my ideas. Period.</strong>\n\nI had a critical insight. It was this: If it did not directly contribute to the welfare of the planet or humanity,<strong> I simply would not do it for cash</strong>. I have been poor since, I have borrowed money from friends and taken years to pay it back, I've clung to the edge. I've been damn near homeless. But I've never stepped back into the position of doing what I'm told for money because it seemed like the only choice, and <strong>that rule has become second nature</strong> - taking money for doing what is not aligned with my goals is now as eating meat is to a vegetarian - an unnatural act. It never occurs to me to be something I could do, and weirdly enough nobody seems to offer me that kind of work any more anyway. It's just ceased to exist to me.\n\nI cannot recommend this path to anyone. It came out of my own meditation practice, my own life experience, the fact I had no family or dependants to take care of, the fact I had a strong community that would occasionally catch me if I fell. But as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi\">Gandhian</a>, there's a point where you start having to put what you know about the world into action, and it changes you. Partly it's what comes from meditation, partly it's from understanding at an intellectual level how we slip away from the truth. Partly it comes from psychotherapy, from the various traditions that help us square what we know and what we feel with each other, to integrate knowing-being-action as a single whole. For whatever reason, it became who I am.\n\nWhat's come out of never working just for money is considerable enterprise in trying to figure out how to make a living doing the right thing. I've learned <strong>four tricks</strong> which have consistently helped.\n\n<strong>The first comes from <a href=\"http://radio-weblogs.com/0107127/stories/2002/12/23/genghisJohnChuckSpinneysBioOfJohnBoyd.html\">John Boyd</a></strong>, a great American <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_%28military_strategist%29#Foundation_of_theories\">philosopher of conflict</a> who in more reflective times might have been hailed as the American <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu\">Sun Tzu</a> (or, more likely, the American \u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi\">Musashi</a>). Boyd went through a long phase of living on as little as he could as a way of getting freedom from government bureaucracy - <strong>a person who needed nothing, who had nothing to lose, could not be controlled</strong>. Minimizing needs is one aspect of maximizing freedom. Boyd is worth reading, his presentations are some of the shortest, most effective cognitive psychology tutorials ever written.\n\n<strong>The second comes from science fiction, specifically <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk\">cyberpunk</a>. </strong>This old genre flourished in the 1980s and 1990s and talked about a world dominated by information technology and economic/ecological crisis - a straight and reasonable projection into the present, albeit with a Bladerunner-type sheen. What I learned from cyberpunk is very, very simple: <strong>bet on technology</strong>. I've consistently projected forwards accurately by assuming things would get better and cheaper, more or less regardless of other trends, and by staying one or two steps ahead of other thinkers by having a better feel for technological progress, I've managed to retain a lot of currency while actually having to struggle less on policy agendas. By <strong>continuously calibrating \u00a0against the moving target of technological progress</strong>, I'm always just a little ahead of the curve, regardless of the news. This may sound strange, but it's amazing how being able to say <em>\"well, in a year this will be half the price, so let's start doing it the digital way and wait for the gear to arrive\"</em> makes you look like a prophet when the relevant equipment becomes cheap. There are lots of other megatrends one can follow this way, and learning to lean into the megatrends - without betting everything on a specific cognitive model of the future - is a really important part of making a living while maintaining an <em>unreasonable</em> moral stance. Science fiction is a cheap way to buy critical insight into what is coming, and to be a day early. <strong>Those of an unbending disposition need every single edge they can find.</strong>\n\n<strong>The third is about the power of networks. </strong>Very simply,<strong> your reputation for getting the job done is the only thing that matters.</strong> I have an anger problem - the same ability which I've calibrated over years, which lets me break the models of extremely powerful organizations by direct engagement (i.e. butting heads with powerful people and <strong>forcing</strong> them to admit they are wrong and their organizations need to change), that power occasionally gets inappropriately pointed at <strong>individuals</strong> I'm working with, rather than corporate and government bureaucrats. I'll come to the conclusion that something has to be done a particular way, and stamp on anybody who gets in the way in a manner which makes sense in life-or-death situations, but comes off as sociopathic in lower stakes arenas. But because I recognize that I've screwed up afterwards and make amends where possible, and most importantly of all, because I <strong>GET THE JOB DONE</strong> people deal with it. If I was the most pleasant person imaginable, but once in a while I signed up to do something, and simply <strong>did not deliver</strong>, my reputation would be terrible. <strong>People will forgive almost anything from performers</strong>, and so the most critical part of being part of a network is to <strong>reliably deliver the goods, particularly when money is on the line</strong>, and to have a realistic model of your failings so that <strong>when you screw up (and you will) you can at least take responsibility</strong>. I cultivate deep relationships with people who deliver and have a realistic model of themselves and their capabilities, and will put up with an enormous amount of flakiness and unpredictability as long as lines of communication stay open, and the job gets done. This allows me to work productively with people I'd never, ever employ, and who'd likely never employ me, because the <strong>pathology of the boss-employee relationship would not allow us to work around each-other's human failings in an intelligent way</strong>. We are not machines, and yet the job must get done. In conventional employment, we'd be trapped in the roles the workplace assigned us, and much useful human productivity would be discarded. <strong>To be a good citizen of a powerful network, you have to be reliable and real - and that's a completely different thing from appearing to be or trying to be perfect!</strong>\n\n<strong>Finally, there is the tricky matter of financial reserves.</strong> My observation, and it's a bloody awful truth, is that <strong>the more you save, the longer it is between gigs</strong>. The money always seems to just about run out before the next thing comes in, no matter how lean the burn is between events. It's just the way life seems to work for freelances I know. So rather than saving, which requires bets about the future, I suggest that when you have money, <strong>pay your debts and help your friends</strong>, because in time you'll have no money again, but you'll still have friends. You have to <strong>make sure that your friends have the same basic values</strong> and levels of support that you do for this to work, however. Some people assume that family is paramount, and friendships come and go, and that's true for them. Others assume that family are just the people you're born near, and friendships are more important because we choose our friends, particularly as adults. <strong>All those systems of values are valid</strong>, but if you're going to pursue the strategy of building really deep, strong relationships as <strong>a buffer against uncertainty</strong>, you have to go deep into your friends values and make sure you understand what they <strong>can and cannot</strong> be counted on for. You have to understand strengths, weaknesses and limits. And, on average, you have to be prepared to give a lot more than you get, because you<strong> give in plenty and receive in need</strong>, and you must maintain real diversity even with people you have profound disagreements or breaches with or your network will not be diverse enough to support you. In many ways it's a lot harder than money, but it's also much more durable. <strong>Our wealth in the late 20th and early 21st century was a rainbow of oil on a puddle</strong>, a few molecules of borrowing over simple facts - the Chinese do most of the manufacturing, we export little, the Energy mostly comes from foreign nations exporting oil and coal to us, and our countries no longer negotiate from strong positions. But friendship is an ancient thing, and strong friends will get you through hard times better than any amount of money in a bank. 8 hours a day, 200 days a year, for forty years is enough to be able to afford a house. But no amount of money can buy you a friend.\n\nMy experience is that I could not make money, but <strong>I could make meaning</strong>, and money comes with it often enough to enable me to survive.\n\nI know that's a radically different vision from what most people expect or want for themselves, particularly for people who want a family and need the security and stability that children need. <strong>I just want you to know that there is a different path, and that you have friends who walk it.</strong>\n\n</div></div>\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-09 17:44:53", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 07:05:31.036356", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2731, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 40.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5913, "user_id": 3331, "topic_id": 5880, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\">Table of contents</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"#tactics\">Legal tactics</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"#logic\">Logic of this document</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">\n\n<a name=\"tactics\"></a>Legal tactics</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Don't incorporate</h3>\n\nIf you are not a legal entity, you are obviously exempt from any authorization regime, bureaucracy requirements etc. Your scope for action is limited only by the freedom of individuals in your legal system.\u00a0\n\nOn the downside, unincorporated initiatives cannot easily use some of the services that legal entity can.

One of its advantages: industrial spaces or office buildings can be temporarily repurposed as living quarters.

Weil ich an mir selber einfachm merke dass ich wenn ich selber \u00fcberfordert bin oder nicht gl\u00fccklich bin, dass ich dann komplett zumache und gar nicht so zug\u00e4nglich bin f\u00fcr die menschen um mich herum und ihre bed\u00fcrfnise wahrnehmen kann und meine rolle erf\u00fcllen w\u00fcrde so wie ich das wollen w\u00fcrde. Und das hat f\u00fcr mich auch ganz viel mit den strukturen in denen wir uns bewegen zu tun. Ich besch\u00e4ftige mich viel mit dem gedanken wie will ich leben und wie will ich arbeiten weil ich das selber noch nicht wei\u00df. Weil die modelle in meiner arbeit oder uni mich nicht erf\u00fcllt haben und ich nicht das gef\u00fchl habe mein potenzial nicht voll ausf\u00fcllen zuk\u00f6nnen. Weil ich mich frage: f\u00fcr wen mache ich das eigentlich? Das war meist in meinem leben: andere zufrieden zu stellen, also meine eltern oder die erwartungen der gesellschaft zu erf\u00fcllen. Also eine gewisse rolle zu spielen. Und ich merke dass ich da einfach immer so an diesen punkt komme dass ich so blockiere und so einen shutdown kriege und dann einfach zwei wochen nicht weiterarbeiten kann \u2013 weil ich die relevanz einfach auch nicht habe etwas zu tun, das eben auch nicht gesellschaftlich wirksam ist.\n\nDiese trennung von leben auf der einen und arbeit auf der anderen seite finde ich pers\u00f6nlich ganz schwierig weil wir den gr\u00f6\u00dften teil unseres lebens ja mit arbeit verbringen m\u00fcssen oder auch wollen aber das heisst dass die arbeit die wir tun, sollte ja auch irgendwie integriert sein in unser leben und ich habe das gef\u00fchl dass sie es eben nicht tun.\n\n<strong>Hast du ne idee wie das f\u00fcr dich funktionieren k\u00f6nnte?</strong>\n\nJa, also auf jeden fall fnde ich so ans\u00e4tze wie die sicherung der existenz, sei es in form von nem grundeinkommen, dass du einfach etwas tun weil du es einfach tun m\u00f6chtest.

I browsed through the tool section of farmhacks - that'll be keeping people busy for some long winter nights!\n\n1.5 ideas I can throw at this though:\n\nDIY sensor-heater elements. If you put enough carbon black into a plastic resin it'll eventually become somewhat electrically conductive. If you made this material into a ring, or \"C\", or small rod that could be dropped into a flower pot, you could use Joule heating to manage the temperature of a seedling for seasonal extension. Of course I am by no means sure it is smart to use expensive (probably early morning PV) electricity for that - but on the other hand you would hopefully be very precise - so you wouldn't need a whole lot if the seedling is well insulated and not yet in the ground.\n\nEven if that turns out be impractical you could still use this as a temperature sensor. The resistivity of the plastic-carbon mixture will vary by a few percent if the temperature changes - and if designed correctly (I could probably help a little with that) significantly around freezing. If you're overall resistance is in the right ball-park this is not very hard to pick up. Of course as the polymer degrades over the decades this value would drift over time as well. But I'd think that if you check them once every other year or so and take notes - it would probably work okay for a long time.\n\nThere is one more bug/feature which is that the sensor material mixture will also take up and give off moisture (for epoxy 1-3% by weight). That also affects conductivity. Now you can of course drop in a <em>second </em>moisture <em>insensitive</em> temperature sensor and work out the moisture level by the difference between the two. One could make the second sensor very similar to the first, but have a relatively thick non-conductive layer around it (if you can't work in a reliable moisture barrier). This would not really make it insensitive - but it would make it slower to react. Thus you would base your reading on the lag between the two, and should be able to manage an approximately constant level. And of course you could use a regular pt100, or type K, or some such to give you the missing variable as well.\n\nLastly, it should be possible to make arrangements to monitor soil conductivity if you add <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_resistivity\">two more leads</a> to this. Although I would think you should consider a induction based system for your fields (does not seem to be on the tools list yet).\n\nThe second idea is really not very concrete yet. Basically it addresses that nomadic part of the approach. At one point I got a little tired of moving and having to look for a niche in one overrun place after another. That led me to explore container (long distance shipping possibility) approach to this. The following is a real old concept and probably only good to illustrate some core ideas:\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6f64b830669a229b123952751853713a1917eeb8.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"347\"><br>\n\nYou basically make the load bearing structure out of ISO TEU containers and dangle the insulation from them. Usually you should be able to get a decent R-value based on the surface to (container) volume that you'd be able to stuff back into the containers. I think I had PUR sheets and glass or PC in mind back then. The temperature in most of the volume would still be pretty variable - similar to a green house. The only volume that would be kept at optimum comfort temperature (in this example) is the little part wedged between the containers on the second level, basically the living room. Moisture and temperature management and wind loads would surely need some serious thought - though I see no absolute show-stoppers. Of course you could go pretty cheap on materials in the beginning and ramp up later.\n\nIn your applications I'd be thinking it may make sense to keep one container on a location permanently and \"activate\" a location by hauling a second temporary one with the more mobile kit to it. If you stack that on top you already have a very sturdy load bearing structure you could anchor a very light and well insulated living structure\u00a0 onto. And of course a ground level workshop (including hoist/pulley system), and perhaps a <a href=\"http://www.mielkesfarm.net/hightunnels.htm\">tunnel</a> system.\n\nI made a sketch here. If it is unclear I can explain the main components.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cda63b4272e6b6dabac105c90ca09e2254121c7f.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-01 14:28:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:13.290656", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 883, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19729, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 4636, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2015-10-29 05:05:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.878365", "deleted_at": "2017-08-05 20:21:24.744251", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12791, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 4606, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-08-09 16:47:18", "updated_at": "2017-08-09 16:47:18", "deleted_at": "2017-08-11 21:55:01.830159", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 977, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 944, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Edgeryders is a distributed think tank where we come together, inspire one another and help each other.

The day I was awakened by the turbulent chimes of the bells, had witnessed the devotion turned into desperation, saw the history crumbling down right in front of my eyes as I lay helpless. The history that spoke to me once, was silent then, all I could hear was a terrifying cacophony. The centuries old architectonic works tumbled down so did the spirit of a young aspiring architect.\n\nThe first few weeks we were all striving to help meet the primary needs of the Earthquake victims. Meanwhile thousands of temporary shelters were been built, the government proposing an integrated settlements with a scope of welcoming global architecture.I stood there on crossroads trying to understand the intellects concern about inclusive and exclusive architecture, about the socio cultural values while initiating the rebuilding process, engineers proposals about bringing change in materials and construction scenario of the rural areas. With the monsoon season already starting, it seems like a large void has been created between the immediate solutions and future riots. I understand human lives are a first priority. Saving lives are more important than saving culture and architecture and I will not want to live inside a home built with mud mortar but we cannot turn a blind eye to the socio- cultural aspects being jeopardized. We can see a door open for global architecture, rapid development but can the people be forced to leap into a revolution which took the westerners 300 years?\n\nArchitecture or a built environment of a place defines the person\u2019s past, present and future. It is because the humans react and interact with the built environment on a daily basis. People see themselves in it. But the choice is theirs whether to write new stories in the blank slate nature has given to fill in or cling to the past.\n\nThere is always a conflict between the natural and industrial materials in terms of flexibility, ecological balance, cost and availability. Industrial materials like concrete and steel being responsible for global warming by 50% but being a reliable and durable means of construction while the natural and biodegradable materials like bamboo, timber, rammed earth, stone being more climate responsive but the cost and reliability being questioned.\n\nOne could speculate that our ancestors had the belief of living with the nature or maybe it was by default. They had used the bio degradable materials in their conventional way of construction. The residential buildings were built with such materials because they respected in the theory of impermanence and accepted the defeat against nature gracefully or again we can ponder that they had no other choice. While the materials used for heritages and temples were strong and expensive which needed high level of craftsmanship since heritages are supposed to last longer for the posterity and ordinary people couldn\u2019t afford those materials.\n\nAll I wanted to say is that the past architecture was ecological responsive, were\u00a0 self-sustaining. Now as the government opens door for prefabricated houses as physical rebuilding process, the memories and identity of a place could possibly be extinguished. A place can trigger memories of a past, the memories have no chance of existing if the whole geography of the place is being airbrushed out\n\nBhaktapur, known as the living museum, we would marvel at its authenticity and ingenuity. Now, as the city lies in rubbles, I can\u2019t help but wonder if the same genuineness could be portrayed.\n\nCareful consideration is vital in order to triumphantly rebuild the lost artifacts whilst accepting the nature of destruction. The reasons of failure of structures could be the lack of maintenance, overlooking the life span of the materials and structure as a whole, use of low-grade construction materials and the techniques used, ustable grounds, waterlogged soil, slopy grounds, raising storeys\u00a0 etc.\n\nWith the lessons learnt from this great catastrophe and taking in account the flaws of our past construction patterns and also the socio cultural aspects, we need to find a middle way. There needs to be a balance between the conventional and modern way of construction in the process of rebuilding. We need to look at the situation in a different angle.\n\nNepal being an Earthquake prone area, mud mortar need to be exiled. Bricks and stones are as strong as the mortar is. The brick obtained from the 55 window palace carries more strength than the first class bricks even after 300 years according to Architect and cultural historian Sudarshan Raj Tiwari, so maybe we need to explore the methods used by our ancestors and try to bring more strength to it by modern technologies. The engineers may take a challenge in creating a strong mortar so that even natural resources can be incorporated into the designs. Earth rammed houses can be a hype considering the ecological aspect. The lower floors can be constructed with rammed earth walls while the upper floors could consist bamboo walls covered in mud plaster. It is easier to incorporate traditional techniques and aesthetics by use of light jhingati roofs. The cost of timber is sky rocketing, it is impossible to rebuild with timber as a structural element again, we can maybe replace it with some steel sections in the inside while maintaining the aesthetics in the front\u00a0facade.\n\nHowever some changes should be made. Light plays an important role in our daily lives. The traditional houses admit minimal light, the kitchen placed at the top floor. The idiosyncratic beliefs have to be encountered.\n\nNepal is rich in culture and art. The rebuilding process shall not overlook the socio cultural aspect. We need to incorporate modern techniques and materials as well but the dependency should not be exceed. The formidable prospect of rebuilding is overwhelming but the essence of a certain village, the identity must also be preserved in my opinion but also the lessons from the past must be taken into consideration\u00a0 in providing strength and resilience. Only then Nepal will rise in a true sense.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-25 15:42:42", "updated_at": "2017-08-28 10:21:54.488328", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false,

href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola%C5%A1in\">Kolasin</a>, a small, sleepy mountain city in the northern Montenegro.\u00a0 During that time,\u00a0<a href=\"/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359\">LOTE4</a>\u00a0was launched, which provided a nice nudge for me to take the little one in adventure.\u00a0<strong>\u00a0Our mission:</strong>\u00a0find a case of community stewardship in the area (and indirectly get a ticket to the event in October!).\u00a0 The result of this search is a story about one man and his love of nature that gave birth to Montenegro\u2019s first botanical garden.\n\nDaniel Vincek was born in Zagreb, Croatia in 1926.\u00a0 At the university, he switched a major in marine biology to study trade because the communist Yugoslavia at the time needed more trade experts.\u00a0 The career in trade could not have been farther away from the great outdoors, but it got him traveling extensively throughout the former Socialist Federalist Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ).\n\nEventually he retired in Kolasin, where he pursued his two loves- hiking and plants.\u00a0 Nestled among 4 mountain peaks (Bjelasive, Sinjajevine, Komovi, and Durmitor), the city sits on the crossroads of thousands of kilometers of hiking and trekking trails.\u00a0 It is also one of the global hotspots of biodiversity (Montenegro\u00a0 is in the top 10 countries with the highest biodiversity in the world).\u00a0\n\nDaniel\u2019s collection of unique mountain species, especially those endangered and protected, that he picked up on his hiking adventures grew, and so did the interest of various academics, naturalists and citizens looking for herbal remedies (medicinal plants) who had very few other places to turn to for practical advice, knowledge and a place that has such a huge repository of different species.\u00a0 So Daniel\u2019s passion eventually grew into a botanical garden-\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.tokolasin.me/ponuda/kulturna-ruta/3-botanicka-basta/\">established in 1981,</a>\u00a0literally on 646 square meters of Daniel\u2019s and Zora\u2019s (his wife) home.\u00a0 The garden features today over 400 different species out of which some 90% are medicinal herbs (he cautions me twice not to forget to mention that professor Vukic Pulevic of Montenegrin academy of sciences played a great role in making this happen).\n\nSo one man\u2019s passion became the community resource.\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Hundreds of master\u2019s and PhD students</strong>\u00a0used the garden (and its extensive herbarium) as a source of field and scientific research.\u00a0 They\u2019ve used and contributed to a database that Daniel set up for monitoring individual plants\u2019 life cycles, form and their specific structural features.\u00a0 Many of the students give back- a group of them led by Danijela Steshevic from the Math Faculty in Podgorica designed a database for searching and sorting over 500 plant species for the garden.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\t\tEach year, from May through August,\u00a0<strong>over 3,000 tourists visit the garden</strong>, many coming to Kolasin exclusively to meet with Daniel Vincek.\u00a0 This was the best part of the experience for me- listening to his many stories about plants -\u00a0 from the one that was used to poison Socrates (hemlock), to acanthus that inspired the Corinthian style of architecture.\u00a0 Daniel is a charming, master story-teller- you can see him\u00a0 in action\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ar1t6jec8\">here</a>\u00a0(though the video is in Montenegrin).\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Steven Foster of National Geographic,</strong>\u00a0an author of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Reference-Natures-Medicine-Steven-Foster/dp/0792236661\">Desk Reference for Nature\u2019s Medicine</a>, visited the garden and was so impressed with the variety of plants that he dedicated a\u00a0<a href=\"http://stevenfoster.com/photography/imageviewssubs/crna_gora/botanicka/basta_080411/index.html\">whole space on his site to it</a>.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\t\tA group of\u00a0<strong>Japanese citizens visit Montenegro each year</strong>\u00a0to have Daniel take them on an tour to pick up seeds of a plant called Helleborus that by cross-fertilizing with the domestic types have produced an entirely new flower species in Japan.\u00a0 Globally, Helleborus grows only in Europe, and Montenegro features 4 different types of it.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\t\tProfessor of botany from the Prague University, Daniela Fisherova, initiated renaming of a plant Alchemilla Vulgaris into\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.priroda.cz/slovnik.php?detail=13344\">Alchemilla Vinceki</a>\u00a0to honor Daniel\u2019s contribution to the global community of botanist.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nHowever (and isn\u2019t there always an \u2018however\u2019), as Daniel puts it, \u2018Once I die, I don\u2019t know what happens to the garden.\u2019\u00a0 So here is a guy who has dedicated the last 30 years of his life tending to and maintaining the first botanical garden in the country strictly for the \u2018love of the game.\u2019 \u00a0The garden has served as the basis for scientific research and tourism development of the region and the country, and yet his biggest concern- what happens to it when he goes?\u00a0\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t for the lack of Daniel\u2019s ideas and initiatives that he has come to ask the question.\u00a0 He has sketched out a\u00a0<strong>network of hundreds of kilometers of hiking trails specifically running by places that feature unique medicinal plants</strong>.\u00a0 He\u2019d like a\u00a0<strong>garden to become a field/remote-classroom for various Universities</strong>- in a way extending the basis for scientific research but\u00a0 as importantly ensuring that the garden lives on.\u00a0 Daniel and Zora (who is an agronomist herself) had an idea of\u00a0<strong>turning and branding Kolasin into the City of Flowers</strong>.\u00a0 And none of this is to mention the need to upkeep and maintain the garden as is today- which requires effort, and knowledge, and resources- all shouldered by Daniel and Zora!\n\nThey\u2019ve spoken with the local authorities, local tourism organization, the Natural Museum, Nature Protection Institute, the Faculty of Science and Math- at one point or another, each has engaged with Daniel on a project or two but without a more sustained and long term view of how the garden fits within the regional or national science or tourism development picture. \u00a0\n\nSo we go back to Daniel question, \u2018Once I die, I don\u2019t know what happens to the garden?\u2019

of your software. What is it, and what does it do?</strong>\n\n<strong>Pablo:</strong> Lorea is a project to create secure social cybernetic systems, in which human networks will become simultaneously represented on a virtual shared world.\n\nIts aim is to create a distributed and federated nodal organization of entities with no geophysical territory, interlacing their multiple relationships through binary codes and languages.\n\nOn the scope of the project we use different open source software, like elgg, postfix or ejabberd to implement such communication, where we're developing key modules to extend their possibilities.\n\n<strong>Why did you decide to implement social web federation?</strong>\n\n<strong>Pablo:</strong> One of our main goals is to have good federation mechanisms for communication among networks of people. We think federation is critical for privacy in the internet because it guarantees you can decide where your data is while still being able to communicate with people on other networks.\n\n<strong>Why did you choose OStatus?</strong>\n\n<strong>Pablo:</strong> Our systems want to talk to everyone that wants to speak to them, so we decided to implement OStatus since its an open standard with high alignment with our project in the scope.\n\n<strong>What parts of the OStatus suite have you implemented?</strong>\n\n<strong>Pablo:</strong> We have implemented activity streams, salmon and pubsubhub support for many types of objects. We also have some extensions currently, and are in the process of finishing of webfinger support for better connection with StatusNet.More detailed info can be followed at: <a href=\"https://n-1.cc/pg/dokuwiki/1760/doku.php?id=federation\" title=\"https://n-1.cc/pg/dokuwiki/1760/doku.php?id=federation\">https://n-1.cc/pg/dokuwiki/1760/doku.php?id=federation</a>\n\n<strong>What problems did you have?</strong>\n\n<strong>Pablo:</strong> Our main problem is the activity streams/OStatus ontology misses some important things for us. Other thing I can see I regard as problematic is the difficulty to do inter-network federation tests with other software.\n\n<strong>How can users try out OStatus in your software?</strong>\n\n<strong>Pablo:</strong> On a shared node, they can participate on remote groups to a certain extent, and message or friend remote users, also soon subscription of remote OStatus profiles will be possible directly for users (right now the admins of networks are the only ones capable of pulling remote users or groups). Also, our profiles can be subscribed to by OStatus users. Current nodes supporting OStatus federation include <a href=\"http://redesenred.net/\" title=\"http://redesenred.net\">http://redesenred.net</a>, <a href=\"https://n-1.cc/\" title=\"https://n-1.cc\">https://n-1.cc</a>, <a href=\"https://red.artelibredigital.net/\" title=\"https://red.artelibredigital.net\">https://red.artelibredigital.net</a>.\n\nOn personal nodes, since the user is the admin there are a lot more things that can be done including a lot of experimental use of OStatus with other techniques. Any group or profile can be subscribed to.\n\n- Pablo\n\n</div>\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-06 16:16:03", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 07:14:20.135480", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 610, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 71.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5098, "user_id": 2330, "topic_id": 5065, "post_number": 1, "raw": "LOTE5 needs a grand narrative, we need a grand narrative in order to align discourses and have a common reference on why this is the place to learn about failing and unfailing.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-17 09:35:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:29.487156", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 34, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2684, "user_id": 1908, "topic_id": 2651, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi everyone,\u00a0\n\nNice to be here and be part of this online community.

Between then and now she experimented around public \u2013 private space in Istambul, the Netherlands, Brussels and chose to practice her philosophy with her boyfriend, a product designer by living small (<a href=\"http://us12.campaign-archive2.com/?u=052ead8788cf3b1aea33b9d84&amp;id=abb57f6591&amp;e=0e34db7b1d\">We\u00a0Live\u00a0Small\u00a0</a>is an on-going experiment developing tools to make living in\u00a0small space possible.)\n\nWhen we meet again she comes back from a week working in her apartment and starts explaining why they chose to live small. For her living in a condensed space within the city is ideal if you design it well. In Belgium people have the reflex to buy fast, and you feel a societal pressure around it. Because buying in the city become impossible, people find big houses farther away from the city. But big houses means a lot of possessions, and it means working harder in desk jobs in the city, which means again more stress. So the logical decision to stop this infernal spiral for them was to choose to live small, really small, and use the exterior as complementary.\n\nThe secret of living decently in the city is to manage space and time differently, but she is aware that it becomes more difficult. Public space isn\u2019t anymore a space for everybody, but a space for nobody. A cleaned-out space that only looks pretty. Because our fascination for more <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;utm_content=feature&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook\">sterile environments</a> we lost the skills to interact with each other. Who needs to interact with your neighbour if you have all the space you need inside your private home. Living small could bring back the necessity of interaction and borrowing stuff from your neighbours, helping create a much-needed social fabric to your neighbourhood.\n\nWhen she works for the semi-public private space project <a href=\"http://www.huis-vdh.org\">Huis VDH</a> she finds the same logic. Creating common spaces that gives the feeling of a home, but are able to invite people over to use it in certain ways. Why have a big living room with kitchen for social events that you organize four times a year at home when you could share such space with other people. Some things can be privatized but not everything. In the same line of thought she sees empty spaces above shops or pubs and restaurants as an opportunity to create common spaces for people living small. You could think: why not set bigger apartments above those places? That could immediately make it difficult for the bar or restaurant holder to continue his night live activities, and also this plays an important role in the city.\n\n\u2018But how could it directly be linked with care?\u2019, i asked her. She takes the example of elderly care, also discussed in the interview with <a href=\"/t/little-side-note-what-is-the-role-of-the-government-in-this-bottom-up-open-care-project/693\">Ginette</a> where people even if they live in big houses don\u2019t have the time anymore to care for their elderly and put them into homes, from own experience we conclude that the home isn\u2019t the best designed space to give good care. Making effort to create a nice environment for the elder people could help them feel well longer. We know from studies that interaction is a key in stopping <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/175303708X390464\">elderly dementia</a>. So having public spaces designed around giving care and sharing part of your lives with unknown people could be a major incentive for our future problems with ageing population.\n\nWhen living in Istanbul it occurred to her that people interacted much more easily with each other in the street, even complete strangers could discuss with each other when waiting for the bus. She doesn\u2019t know exactly why it occurred much more often in Istambul then in Brussels but she had the feeling the way we use time was part of the solution. Living small gives you much more time to just sit around, be outside and make you car independent. Only this simple part, of not having a car makes you much more able to interact with the people you see. But don\u2019t be alarmed; this discussion didn\u2019t became a \u2018everything was better in the past\u2019 discussion.\n\n<a href=\"http://cascoland.com/#/\">Cascoland</a> was another project where she worked around public and private space. One of the tasks she had was to implement a sharing community inside a mixed neighbourhood. Like in Germany or Suisse they printed out little signs of objects anybody could put on their door to show they can lent this out. What was interesting was the conclusion: when explaining the concept to people with only Dutch roots they answered almost all the time: but I have nothing to share. For them it was a difficult step to share something of their belongings with their neighbours. When explaining the concept to people with Arab roots for example they didn\u2019t have a problem with sharing and where found of the idea, but had a problem with the fact the stickers would become an opportunity for other people to come inside. Inside their community they already had all the needed interaction and didn\u2019t want something external extra. A compromise could be the organization<a href=\"http://www.tournevie.be/english/\"> Tournevie</a> that puts in disposal several tools for the community. A semi-private public space, as we understand it.\n\nWe conclude on the fact that the creation of digital tools will not alone be the solution, what we need are well thought of spaces that give people the possibility to live at a descent standard without needing to fall in the spiral of a purely private ownership.\n\nSigried will be participating to the Open&amp;Change Workshop in Brussels and will be working on the scenography of the place to give it a welcoming space to be creative about care solutions. \u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-15 17:28:13", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 16:32:17.649170", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1088, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 46.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30167, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 4681, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Hey <a href=\"/u/sneha_pandey\">@Sneha_Pandey</a>, thank you for introducing the trick to us.

Maybe it is something I am simply looking for as a nomad and cosmopolitan whose identity can be expressed at best by speaking Polish at a native level. That's about my sense of belonging. So, here would be my first area of interest - what do you think of a nation state as the grad motivator for people?\n\nSecondly, I wonder what would be a short list of projects that contribute to the common good - and\u00a0 the reasons why you consider Melamchi a singular path? I only know that the project is spectacular, costs much more than expected and unfinished since what... decades from what I have heard? Or at least a significant, high number of years. These things do seem to be necessary in Nepal, same with sewage treatment plant which is being built only now, when the riverbanks stink worse than hell.\n\nI am throwing questions around and wondering about your opinions.

Over the past few months\u00a0I've been learning a lot about social capital and the features of social networks that really drive change\u00a0from the bottomless bit of knowledge and lovely human being that is [Bert-Ola].\u00a0One of the things that keeps resurfacing\u00a0is\u00a0how important\u00a0it\u00a0is to adopt a practice of taking every opportunity to connect\u00a0one another with good people, places and projects things happening anywhere and everywhere. One way in which we can do this is through this\u00a0blog. If each of us volunteers to curate one blogpost containing news of cool things we come across a week, we all stand to benefit :) \u00a0\n\nSo here are\u00a0a couple of things\u00a0I came across this week I thought would be nice to share:\n\n1.\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/adventures-in-consumer-technology/421458c6fa66\">Copygram</a>: Why? Because they have an interesting business model, you can order prints of the images \u00a0online which generates revenue for the people conributing towards creating value. We have community members all over the place, many who have instagram.

I\u00a0think these two spaces are beautiful and that we can learn alot from them, maybe even share some of our stories on them so others can find us. Medium is more reflective, Cowbird more poetic.\n\n3.

Il a raison de montrer certaines qualit\u00e9s humaines qui permettent d'innover (faire autre chose ...) et il risque d'avoir tort s'il laisse penser que seuls ce genre de g\u00e9nies peut \"nous sauver\". Bien s\u00fbr l'humanit\u00e9 est faire de gens poss\u00e9dant des qualit\u00e9s vari\u00e9es, certaines utilisables dans un type d'environnement, dans une civilisation et d'autres qui ne sont pas accept\u00e9es et marginalisent leur porteur. Par exemple on vient de faire l'hypoth\u00e8se que les personnalit\u00e9s autistes dans les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de chasseurs-cueilleurs devaient \u00eatre tr\u00e8s utilises lorsque leur \"trouble\" les conduisaient \u00e0 avoir une m\u00e9moire importante, si ce n'est absolue. Ils d\u00e9chargeaient la communaut\u00e9 de devoir se souvenir de tout \u00a0(r\u00e9serves, paysages, etc.) et permettaient aux autres individus d'utiliser leur m\u00e9moire \u00e0 d'autres fins. Mais la plupart des civilisations ont su artificialer cette qualit\u00e9 port\u00e9e par des autistes en concevant diff\u00e9rents outils, processus, de m\u00e9morisation, accessibles et utilisables par un plus grand nombre.\n\nDonc nous devons pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer des m\u00e9thodes qui permettent de mettre en action ces qualit\u00e9s ou plut\u00f4t leurs effets, d\u00e9crites par le Dr Berns, utilisables par tous. Je pense que cela va d'ailleurs vers la sorte de civilisation que recherche l'Op Gouv.\n\nEn commen\u00e7ant \u00e0 r\u00e9colter des informations sur ce que sont \"les irritants\" vous faites Lyne un premier pas dans une d\u00e9marche de conception. Vous vous dites qu'est-ce que je sais sur cet objet particulier que j'ai d\u00e9sign\u00e9 'les irritants\"? Et ce que je sais qui le dit. Ici Mme d'Irribarne. Sur quoi porte cette connaissance? L'identit\u00e9 psychologique d'irritants.\u00a0\n\nMaintenant nous pouvons aller un peu plus loin en nous demandant quelles connaissants les irritants poss\u00e8dent, \u00e0 quoi elles servent, comment sont-elles utilis\u00e9es, sur quels \"objets\".\n\nNous augmentons les connaissances et nous avons un d\u00e9but de mod\u00e9lisation. Pour l'instant cette mod\u00e9lisation n'est ni locale (sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 une situation et des acteurs pr\u00e9cis) ni abstraite (elle n'a pas valeur d'une sorte de g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9). Il sera int\u00e9ressant d'aller le plus possible vers le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n\nNous pouvons continuer en nous interrogeant pour savoir si nous disposons de toutes les connaissances n\u00e9cessaires pour comprendre la situation ou si nous devons en rechercher d'autres.\n\nCette d\u00e9marche de conception et de mod\u00e9lisation, nous pouvons la reproduire sur l'objet \"leadership\" pour comprendre comment il fonctionne.\n\nNous allons passer dans les deux cas, d'affirmations, de relations de causes \u00e0 effets, \u00e0 des mod\u00e8les complexes, pleins de connaissances.\n\nMoi je trouve toujours cela amusant comme de vendre des balayeuses Electrolux (et ce n'est pas une blague, un jour je donnerai la raison).\n\nBonne soir\u00e9e Lyne.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-26 19:54:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.474319", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 514, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7845, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 4192, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Productive?</b>\n\nI think it's important when discussing openness and communities to highlight where the impetus for this post came from on Nadia's part - EdgeRyders has a closed forum, which is ostensibly an admin board, but has increasingly become the space in which many decisions are made about the direction of the organisation and what the community should do. \n\nIt's located <a href=\"/t/about-the-administration-er-lbg-category/335\">here</a>. Those who have access are the directors of the community and those that essentially govern and coordinate. \n\nOver the past 6-8 months ER has taken directions that many community members have felt uncomfortable about, leading to many of the individuals whom work on unMonastery ostensibly full time to not feel comfortable posting on the platform or participating more generally in EdgeRyders activity. The project has also evolved and developed significantly in the last two years to the point where it requires it's own kernal similar to the way ER has evolved - in order to replicate and have agency. This is good for everyone and the organisational structure being set out by those working on unMonastery full time is being  designed to ensure anyone can join and have agency in the organisational structure, legally - which differs slightly to ER, as ER operates with a board of directors and a diffuse \"The person who does the work calls the shots\" permission mechanism e.g the way the unMon org came about was on the basis of the people doing the work (the 30+ people gathered in Berlin earlier this year) decided this would be a good and productive direction.\n\nAs with any organisational evolution and development there can be growing pains, disagreements and difficulties - it's likely that if you're a regular on ER that you will have seen a significant drop off of posts in this group, because people have felt uncomfortable or unhappy posting here. \n\nLast week I met with Alberto and Arthur in London to discuss if it would be possible to mend these fences and move towards a reconciliatory effort, so both communities could work effectively together - my proposal was to create a group, with facilitation focused on resolving discord and finding out where we can fix what was potentially broken - clearly this wasn't a satisfactory decision for Nadia in this instance. And so this post was made, in a fairly provocative way, that's likely to create more discord and arguments, which is an enormous shame and massively upsetting to me personally. \n\nGiven the desire expressed here for openness and community involvement I think it's important to share here the impetus for this post and discussion, from the ER private admin board.

Membership is essentially based on those who have committed significant time to the unMonastery (around 200 hours over the past year) and pledge that same amount of time going forward.\n\nThis is not intended as a gate keeping exercise but rather is intended to allow unMonastery to act in the operational capacity it requires to replicate, and for those who invest significant time, resources and social capital into the work to have agency and a voice in its future. You were invited to join unMonastery in Berlin for this discussion but didn't turn up, to the extent that we lost money on the hotel room we booked for you, due to your last minute message that you wouldn't be there. \n\nManipulative behaviour is positioning ones self as the de facto representative voice of a community with a diverse set of perspectives without enabling a space where those views can be aired and lead to productive more healthy forms of collaboration.  You cannot repeatedly use this form of rhetoric \"angered some members of the Edgeryders community\" to exercise your will on the direction of the organisation, it creates enormous limitations for what the organisation is capable of. I am a member of the EdgeRyders community, like many of those working on unMonastery that no longer feel comfortable posting here or view it as a productive exercise - and it's clear that is a<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoemiSalantiu/status/575230865128710144\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">significant chunk</a>.\n\nLets be clear though if you continue to hold this position, it's obvious that an exercise such as the one proposed will fail before it starts. \n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n\"\"\"\"", "created_at": "2015-04-25 17:58:28", "updated_at": "2018-03-03 10:42:42.491349", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1886, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [145], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2435, "user_id": 1673, "topic_id": 2402, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\nfile_fid:2281 - Horizon2020proposal template", "created_at": "2014-02-12 16:15:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:13.072153", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27863, "user_id": 149, "topic_id": 4353, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>open source and lemon sector</b>\n\nWe're talking about circular economy for an enabling environment but rather try to advance our niche (\"edge\" / avantgarde / ITC / ...) interests.

So, a \u20ac500 reservation would give rise to a discount of (500 - 80) * 20% = \u20ac84, and therefore cost 500 - 84 = \u20ac416.

Who controls access to the server on which this data is saved?\"\n\nAbout the data: Edgeryders content is Open Data, as stated on the legals page when signing up. As far as I understood Alberto, it is intended to make data dumps available (like for open science purposes etc.). But it seems that the details are not yet worked out, maybe also because <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/spotlight-internet-common-resource/mission_case/what-can-happen-your-edgeryders-data-and-you\">I raised some privacy issues about that</a>.\n\nAs for hosting and software of this platform, it's also my personal impression that the project is not as open as it intends to be. I'm involved with the Edgeryders software side of things a bit more now (see <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/community-heroes/mission_case/what-do-you-want-new-edgeryders-platform-software\">this thread</a>) but as a user of this platform, I know the feeling you have: it's still \"somebody else\" in control of this platform and everything we contribute, and it does not matter so much if that other one is called Facebook or otherwise. But: there's a discussion about this, and progress here on Edgeryders to implement a community-steered platform development process (see <a href=\"#comment-4400\">my other comment</a>).\n\n\"I personally realize there are already all kinds of local groups and movements. \u00a0They may not be called Edgeryders, and may not have any need to be called Edgeryders, but they may share values and interests with what is expressed till now by people interacting on this Edgeryders platform.\n\nFor the moment, I understand Edgeryders as an attempt to crowdsource for policy making... [...]\n\nMy current impression is that each has its own agenda, its own interests and involvements, and that some of our interests overlap...\"\n\nFrom my understanding of the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/community-heroes/mission_case/help-make-sense-collective-project-design-process\">Edgeryders 2.0 project</a>, it's no longer centered on crowdsourced policy recommendations as the original Edgeryders project was. I rather understand it as a kind of \"meta-community\" that supports and connects all these local groups and movements that you list, once they make themselves known to the rest of us on this platform.\n\nSo I largely have the same impression as you: everybody here on Edgeryders comes with existing own initiatives and projects, but has shared interests with others. And from that comes synergy. I acknowledge your efforts in making such synergies happen with decentralized tools like Netention. Yet, as in computing, P2P networking stuff is hard, it takes time to develop that sort of thing. So I see still a place for tools that rather follow the common client-server paradigm, or in this social realm, maybe call it \"community - hub\" paradigm. As long as the server / hub is free and open in its source and operation. Edgeryders aims for that kind of thing, in my impression.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-11-23 00:41:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:00.173720", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 593, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10338], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21482, "user_id": 551, "topic_id": 1293, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Bonne question, Alberto: pourquoi lambda (\u03bb), \u03bb\u03ac\u03bc\u03d0\u03b4\u03b1, 11e lettre de l'alphabet grec ancien (aucun rapport avec l'ancienne Lancia du m\u00eame nom, sinon l'origine \u00e9tymologique)\n\nParce que, en fran\u00e7ais en tout cas, \"le citoyen lambda\" est une expression consacr\u00e9e par l'usage moderne, m\u00e9diatique notamment, pour d\u00e9signer un individu quelconque, moyen, standard (en anglais on pourrait dire 'average' ou encore 'ordinary' people). Un bon dictionnaire comme Hachette propose d'ailleurs comme exemple usit\u00e9 bien significatif: Le citoyen lambda n'est pas touch\u00e9 par cette mesure.\u00a0 En termes de moyenne, on notera que la lettre lambda se situe au milieu de l'alphabet grec, qui en compte 24.\n\nMaintenant, pourquoi ne parle-t-on pas plut\u00f4t usuellement du citoyen b\u00eata (qui veut aussi dire b\u00eate, stupide, en langage familier), kappa, sigma ou epsilon, autres lettres symboliques (mais toutes le sont dans l'alphabet grec... de l'alpha \u00e0 l'omega, \u00e0 mi-chemin desquels se situe lambda)?\n\nProbablement parce que, morphologiquement, le caract\u00e8re lambda est, debout sur ses deux jambes, le plus anthropomorphe de tous - alors que l'alpha, lui, comme son \u00e9quivalent h\u00e9breu aleph, se pr\u00e9sente comme une t\u00eate d'animal, un boeuf cornu). Lambda convient donc bien \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation lexicale d'un homme, individu...quelconque.\n\nIl est possible aussi que la notion lambda soit, dans son usage r\u00e9cent (XXe si\u00e8cle) d\u00e9riv\u00e9e des sciences, que ce soit la science physique, o\u00f9 la minuscule \u03bb d\u00e9signe notamment\u00a0 la longueur d'onde - et ne dit-on pas de plusieurs individus qu'ils sont, ou non, sur la m\u00eame longueur d'onde ? - ou plus vraisemblablement la science math\u00e9matique statistique appliqu\u00e9e aux statistiques humaines. Avec un facteur \u03bb li\u00e9 aux variables fonctionnelles, ou encore aux calculs de probabilit\u00e9s relatives au taux de d\u00e9faillance en fiabilit\u00e9 de certains param\u00e8tres (des hommes comme des machines).

Usually this is the role of the team project.\n\nBy my experience I learned that the important is that the partecipants / contributors perceive that their contributions have all been taken into account and respected. I tried to realize this with the absolute transparency of all decisions: explaining the why and the how of every decision and, in case of crowdfunding, showing how and why the money is been utilized.\n\nparticipants in the project knows that your idea has value and that they are contributing, know that eventually the value will take a price and a possible income for you, but I do not think that their problem is the fact that you can earn from collaborative process and they do not. otherwise they will not participate. maybe then you'll be contributing to their next initiative, as they did with you.\n\n<strong><em>How can an open, collaborative initiative transform itself into a sustainable, long-term enterprise? </em></strong>\n\n<strong><em>is it at all possible to convert cultural value into a market value?</em></strong>\n\nthis is a really intricate issue!!!\n\nI think that a possibility to survive in the long term and convert cultural value in a market value is\n\n- the most possible clearity of the mission in order to the team and the network of the project know what is the final goal and in this way it is limited the possibility of misunderstanding.\n\n<strong>- </strong>new types of indicators in the business plan and calls (bandi) for public funding in order to clarify the economic, social and territorial impact of a collaborative cultural / artistic / creative project, different from the usual return on investment\n\nI hope that I've given you some materials for reflection.\n\nalessia\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-08 12:28:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:25.442662", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 601, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16643, "user_id": 147, "topic_id": 1128, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>I'm not sure about that...don't think so</b>\n\nHey Alberto,\n\nYou missed nothing, I just posted it :) Any chance Ben could come on here and tell us more about this...is he pingable by anyone? :)\n\nI read Vanessa Miemis story back in 2008 about her use of social media to gain traction among the altermondialistes and launch her career. At the same time I was reading 'tipping point' and thinking about how impersonal ideational process moves through the present via relatively unconnected individuals. Way back before twitter ever was we often heard the story of scientists coming up with the same ideas at the same time, yet completely distinct from eachother. This got me thinking of old poetry I used to read from Omar Khayyam, a 13th century mystic who used to talk a lot about the 'transpersonal', it also rings true in Rumi when he writes \"Who speaks with my mouth?\" . The point re: social media is that we now have a connected version of the impersonal prgression of ideas.\n\nIn the case of the seperate scientists, the reason they came up with the same ideas at the same time is because knowledge is not personally subjective, it is based, rather, on conditions. So once conditions are in place for the next step to come to knowledge in a conscious individual it is only natural that this occurs in the most 'prepared' subject. The one with 'all the pieces so far' gets the next piece. So how does this apply to twitter? Well think about it...if all of these fields are developing in the present, then if you want to ride the wave on the edge of that breaking cresent, then you need to 'eat' the same information diet as the folk on the cutting edge. In terms of academia and the scientific disciplines this means a lot of hard graft, but for the modern stuff its a lot easier.\n\nSo when I learned that social business could do good in the world and decided to put the toys away, I picked up a computer and hit up twitter for the top 50 changemakers and started to read what they read. I digested the same information that they did and luckily I had my own learning to support a unique perspective which was of value to peoplt within those circles. Its simple really, and it paid off, not economically of course, as you well know, but it did get me onto the playing field in a relatively short time.\n\nI feel that folk, especially young folk starting out, should know this stuff. They should know why it is the way it is, and dependent on their choice of direction and how far or deep they want to go, they should know how and why and where to target their learning. I'm sure this course will give lots of tools for getting this kind of information out there. And I will use it like this, to learn, to teach, and to move forward. And so may it be for us all :)\n\nExcelsior!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-05-29 00:50:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.119568", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 532, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 865, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 832, "post_number": 1, "raw": "On Wednesday 31st of May there was the closure of the <a href=\"/en/open-call-maker-in-residence-at-wemake-in-milan\">CALL FOR MAKERS</a> | opencare Maker in Residence. \u00a0\n\nThe application process wasn\u2019t easy at all!

Come to think of it, any achievement we have as a group is based on having put together a team, or having collaborated in some way. But most of the time it's circumstantial, as is individual Edgeryders availability to get involved. \n\nexample: The best coordinated work across teams I've seen so far is with organising this last LOTE. But is was highly dependent on the social contract \"LOTE is a no spectators event\", \"It's free for everyone as long as we're building it together\", \"It's our event and we can shape it the way we want to\" and the likes.\n\nI agree, before any formalization of the idea into a diversity of permanent teams we need an idea of the availability and interest of more of us in this. It's one of the reasons our community survey asks respondents if they'd be up for pledging their work to an area they like: some areas have more clearly defined \"if you do X, you can reasonably expect Y to happen\", like organising p2p project development retreats, and no wonder this already [ranks first in popularity](/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f56642838ef68a539a71199af8a065d07c1be692.png). You organise it, you participate in it, hence you move forward with your project. You can expect to see results in a limited timeframe. Same with collaboration on funding. You help write an application, you bring in partners, you clearly have something up your sleeve if we win.\n\n* The effort to coordinate these is not as much high as it is limited in time, and in my opinion that helps.\n\n* The compensation may not be immediate, nor definite, but the intrinsic compensation can replace it (for a while?) : acknowledgement, community kudos, meeting your future collaborators on the way, being go-to person in the community for type of task x when that would be paid for etc. if there would be somewhere where the work is accounted for, for future reference, that would be great. Maybe an \"idle\"/ \"pending\" state of compensation on EconomyApp ?", "created_at": "2013-12-21 13:24:16", "updated_at": "2018-04-24 11:38:18.555660", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 382, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1760, "user_id": 4922, "topic_id": 1727, "post_number": 1, "raw": "A multitude of individual skills and time are highly undervalued, excluded from the labour market in times of layoffs or government inability to provide (at least temporary) support. Yet in various parts of Europe, at hyper local scales, innovative doers are prototyping groundbreaking ways that combine community spirit, peer to peer learning and economic value, while increasing resilience. Initiatives such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGwrcVWI6bw&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Incredible Edible Todmorden</a>, the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/practical-resilience/mission_case/experiments-resilience-small-uk-market-town\">Stroud Open Gardens and Community Supported Agriculture</a> projects in the UK or the <a href=\"http://prinzessinnengarten.net/about/\">Prinzessinnengarten in Berlin</a> are all based on a community volunteering model: some are using donated public land as they grow (organic) food; connect with vendors to generate revenues and become self-sustainable; or campaign for the learning of food-growing in schools; A <a href=\"http://schwarz10.de/\">house project in Leipzig</a> or the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/what-would-you-bring-unmonastery\">Edgeryders unmonastery</a> currently being developed gather international residents living rent-free, having complementary skills that they put at work in a variety of projects to meet community needs.\n\nSuch collectivities are learning communities because they promote exchanges of competencies and nurture feelings of belonging. The benefits for the health of our communities are manifold, because <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/104169463/Edgeryders-Community-Paper-Learning-To-Live\">developing strong ties contributes to leveling down depression and preventing tentative self-harm</a>, especially in young people on the verge of exclusion and isolation. Whether it\u2019s growing food, housing, soup kitchens, health facilities, urban planning, bartering, experimenting with alternative currencies (eg. time banking) etc, such initiatives are increasing the ability to provide for ourselves, acting as social security surrogates, but they are not able to stand alone and often need refinement, further investment and institutional legitimacy. Following the <strong>model of common pooling of resources</strong> successfully implemented in <a href=\"http://www.landco.nl/uploads/Case%20Study_Terre%20de%20Liens.pdf\">Terre De Liens in France</a>, let\u2019s explore whether this could be pursued at a hyperlocal and European level!

I am pretty much a theoretical guy myself, and - despite my well known sweetness and high tolerance for my fellow's human beings - I find myself pretty annoyed at the self-appointed pragmatists that like to say \"oh, but that'not what the real world is like\". Of course it's not! Theory is models, and models HAVE to be simpler than the reality they describe, otherwise there would be no point having the model. The map must never be so accurate as the territory, lest it become the territory and then you are back having to make a map of it.\n\nNow, the interesting question is where you can find the theory that you need. In your case, it turns out, your university did give it to you. Actually (unless I have got that wrong) the \"shock and awe\" internship experience was <em>meant</em> to be broken, so that you could learn just how important organizational awareness is. When I went to university, not so much: we would be taught lots of theory, but not that kind of theory. However, you also offer another suggestion, that of setting up a club/forum/blog or whatever, which basically means you suggest discussing this with your peers.\n\nI would be interested to try that out. In my circle there is organizational lore being passed around: although that is by no means my main concern, I do need a bit of it to function (especially since I work occasionally with large organizations), and so I pay attention. I have to say that a lot of key intuition can be found in a comic strip called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert\">Dilbert</a>. It is meant as a critique of micromanaged office environments; and, since it is well founded, it ends up teaching you stuff like \"meetings are almost always useless and narcissistic environments, and therefore make for a very poor coordinaion technology\". I have occasionally managed people, and have had the good fortune of designing work relationships in teams built from scratch, and Dilbert has been a good reference point as where <em>not </em>to go.\n\nI remember your name from very early Edgeryders, Adria.

The studio was a space for a very wide exploration. The performance was a space for being with an audience (the Hebrew root word for audience speaks to \"coming together\"). In the studio almost everything goes AS LONG AS it was in the context of performance art. Numerous times I witnessed participants fade into an emotional-therapeutic-seeking space in which case they were asked to either re-join the space or leave.\n\nThe studio has its own dynamics. When people arrived at the studio we would first lie down on the floor for an hour (some people crawling around like babies) taking time to completely arrive and connect to ourselves and to each other. There was plenty of space and time, plenty of <a href=\"http://iamronen.com/2008/09/waiting/#grazing\">grazing</a>, plenty of experimentation and occassionaly something magical happened (a magic that always seemed harder to tap into in the performance space). The studio was dedicated to the creators and the creative process. The performance was a tighter event, though mostly unknown it had more specifity. It had a clearer framework which usually felt limiting going in but liberating once inside. The performance had an audience. People who were not in on the subtle agreements of those participating in the creative space. A performance brought with it a simple social obligation - to be graceful hosts to the people we invited to partake in our creation.\n\nI offer this metaphor as a reflection on the EdgeRyders online presence. My impression is that right now we have a studio where everything goes. However our studio is also constantly open to an audience and we are actively inviting an audience to it. Yet it seems that we have not yet paid attention to the fact that we are in performance and there is an audience. I would go so far as to say we have been rude towards our audience. We have not addressed their presence and I believe that instead of telling beautiful stories we have been evoking confusion.\n\nI believe that EdgeRyders is, very much like my studio experience, dedicated to delivering performances. We have the liberty to explore inside as much as we want not forgetting we are here to produce performances. The Edge, regardless of EdgeRyders, is a unique place. It is at the same time the most liberated from and the most obligated to society. It is far enough from social gravity to feel free, but close enough to be connected and meaningful.\n\nThough we may all have our reasons (purposes) for being here, I believe we are here first and foremost for those who are not here with us. This is what I mean when I speak of an <a href=\"/t/designing-edgeryders-online/514/proposal-purpose-what-is-the-purpose-of-edgeryders\">over-reaching purpose</a>. It isn't a purpose that overrides other purposes but rather gives them context.\n\nIf the initial experience of the EdgeRyders website was a login screen, I would be fine with it as is. We are only accountable to ourselves when it comes the studio we come to create in. However the initial experience of the EdgeRyders website is a public affair in which we make claim to \"cutting edge social innovation\" yet we do not present a cutting edge but a messy studio in which we create. Our promise seems to me, as an outsider, not just empty but even false. Not because of what is inside, but because of what is not outside.\n\nI believe there needs to be a clear discernment between the studio and the performance. It is required of us if we are seriously going to step up to the challenge of bettering our societies by reaching out to the edge into unchartered solutions <strong>on their behalf</strong>. If we were content in our social lives we would not be here having this conversation. Our reaching out to the edge is because of, on behalf of and for the betterment of that with which we are not content. If we forget that and lose touch with that then we are floating around purposelessly.\n\nThe beneficiaries of our work are not here with us, they are most probably not even aware of our existence. Our connection with them is through our performances. The unMonastery is a performance dedicated to the people of Matera. The public facing website is also a performance (and it would be useful to figure out who is in the audience).\n\nThe public facing website cannot be stuff that leaks from inside the platform. The public facing website should be a conscious performance recognizing our audience and appreciating the fact that they have taken time out of their life to be with us. We have gotten together to perform, we have aroused an interest in our audience, now lets respect their attention and give them a memorable and moving performance.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-11 15:36:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:11.535236", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 864, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20514, "user_id": 259, "topic_id": 1240, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Good point!</b>\n\nGood point Alberto.

Apropo de awareness si de motive de a ciuli urechile, la mine a existat o oaresce rezistenta in a ma duce la peer-to-peer learning experiences (incubator107, UA), dar odata ce am aflat ca se abordau exact temele pe care cautam sa ma informez (teme\u00a0\u2019noi\u2019, pe care probabil nu le gasesc la o facultate si in care oricum n-as investi ani intregi - experience design, spre exemplu, chiar la voi, cu Corina, care mi-a placut f mult), am trecut peste pragul de scepticism si am devenit fana si propovaduitoare.

If they are using a lot of undercover people, chances are they are expecting this to get worse and are making lists. Lists are of course bad news. Phones should be correctly referred to as \"trackers\" in situations like this, by the way. I assume the more experienced people in that place already know this stuff better than I do (+ for the relevant location/legislation) but I'll just add my two cent, err, luma...\n\nLooking at the video I did see some (but little) clearly (pointlessly) aggressive behavior in some of the uniformed, but more in the plain-clothes + \"weimar\" badge parts. The latter (and often some special units) are usually more closely aligned with the political aspects of such issues. The guys in uniform are mostly \"just taking official orders &amp; doing their jobs\" the way that police is supposed to. At least that is my perception and general experience. Watching for clearly pointless aggressive behavior (which can be difficult to spot, to document, and to assign correctly) is often highly informative. What never hurts is to support any de-escalating initiatives and actions on the streets. Not as in \"backing down\", but as in \"clearly demonstrating and documenting moral superiority\". Ir helps to know <a href=\"http://forums.officer.com/\">what they think</a>.\n\nI would also like to know why they used so much plainclothes officers. I don't think that is a good idea at all. There are good reasons for having a uniform when doing this sort of thing, no?\n\nAlso it struck me that the protesters (and press) did not seem to anticipate the response they got. The fact that the watercannon went directly to high power without much provocation seems to indicated that \"you did not do anything wrong\" but they had this planned beforehand. A picture series with a picture every 0.5s (starting at 39) would perhaps communicate this effectively*. Usually you moderate the pressure to be able to dis/encourage compliant behavior. The watercannon model looked relatively new (perhaps someone was thinking ahead when all the corru-, err, building projects started a little while ago) and should be able to do that.\n\nThe plainclothes guys did not seem to be after anyone in particular (usually their job) but basically just take people from the edge of the group. That is normally the job of uniformed (and protected!) officers.\n\nOther things to do are of course, getting some legal rep and make sure the phone number is known (and on people's skin). Making sure you can trust them, and having a backup just in case.\n\nAnd do try and blur faces of the stuff that is put online if things start to get messy. There is software to do that. You could print a few links to that on a piece of paper and give it to the people with cameras. You might also want to start waterproofing/foam-protecting your cameras a little - so that they are still ready to use when things get messier.\n\nIf I am correct this is at least in part a fallout of the trade sancions vs Russia. This would make the situation smell more like Ukraine. Again - this would be bad news and I would recommend searching youtube a little for Dr. Daniele Ganser (I don't agree on everything with him but it is a under-represented view on things I would say).\n\nIf on the other hand this is just a corporate price hike, demand data, transparency, and accountability - think that is badly needed.\n\nYou have water power - which is dirt cheap once you have it and can balance less reliable power sources (e.g. wind). I mean if <em>US</em> studies show that you have wind potential and then <em>Iran</em> even goes and builds a wind park (when they could be selling you oil!) - what else to you need?! Get crackin!\n\nI mean you have an old nuclear power station...\u00a0 -wait, I just started reading the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metsamor_Nuclear_Power_Plant\">wiki entry</a>. You have a reactor WITHOUT primary containment <em>next</em> to your frickin capital?! Well, at least everyone will know what is up when they hear it go *bang*. On a day like today you'd have about 3 hours to get your affairs in order.\n\nWell it does seem <a href=\"http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/24213743.html\">someone important has attested that \"everything will be fine\"</a>. I somehow doubt such an assessment, especially in the light of developments that make it look like corner may be cut and profits maximized, at the general public's expense. Not to raise any geopolitical concerns combined with public unrest, fanned by heavy handed police tactics.\n\nI can try to connect someone+something to connections I have in wind at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DONG_Energy\">dong</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Wind_Energy\">GE</a>, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senvion\">senvion</a>. But since the nuclear dudes are already pretty far along though, it would have to be something substantial before anything can seriously compete with them (+ they are not known for playing \"nice\"). And in all honesty - I would tread very carefully in your shoes. Especially when the wind blows from the West. The Iranians would of course be another option. How is the general public opinion on this matter? For what it is worth: No wind turbine tell over in Fukushima...\n\n*The lady with the handbag - never underestimate the power of the slightly bored, apolitical, and silent majority on this sort of thing, if you can involve them gracefully.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-23 14:43:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:27.202959", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 994, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4733, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 4700, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Summer always seems to slow things down, and the Ramadan is not helping it either (read how @Hegazy works during Ramadan <a href=\"/t/random-knowledge-on-working-in-egypt-in-ramadan/4609\">here</a>).

One of the challenges of generating the sales is knowing how to find the right prospects- potential customers who have problems that what we have to offer could solve. This is a challenge many people trying to get initiatives off the ground have. A huge contribution would be to build a shared database of names of people and organisations, with credible information about what their most pressing problems and needs are, and how they are currently trying to solve them (or not). This would help us identify the ones with a high likelihood of matching what we have to offer. But it is hugely time consuming if we do it as a small group. How do we engage hundreds of people all over the world to help get this done in one week? Thousands? How do we get people to pay to cover to cover the cost of keeping database updated and improved over time?\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3>Building and managing a sales-oriented relationships effectively</h3>\n\nPerpetual networking. A year between first making contact with a prospective client and a paid invoice.This is the space where a lot of new initiatives get lost. How do we shorten the length of time between initiating a conversation with someone and either finding out that what you have to offer does not match what they need or in the best case signing a deal?\n\nI think it comes down to breaking down the long process of building a mutually generative, strong relationship into smaller steps which involve sharing the risk between both parties (payment for smaller batches of work along the way). What those steps should be depends on what kind of resources the person you are dealing with can mobilise for which kinds of outputs. Those constraints will be different for different people, kinds of organisation, and points in time. For example, individuals working in large organisations work have to navigate a lot of rules and administrative processes. They may have little or no discretionary spending, or only be able to spend money in certain amounts for very specific kinds of deliverable. If what you offer does not match them then no matter how convinced they are they can't pay you for the value your work generates.\n\nYou discover this some way into the sales process and it can't be done \"theory\" so let's try an experiment. Living on the Edge offers x and what makes it special is y. The value generated by this event not only on the participants but the knowledge generated and shared is really really high. If we could harness the same dynamics that go into building an awsome event into generating revenue we would not only cover travel costs, for everyone involved. We could also share the skills, processes and connections made to surface support for community members individual initiatives.\n\nIf you're reading this post you are already involved in it, so it makes sense to use it as our case study.\u00a0\n\nSo how do we start a conversation with someone in a way that sets the conditions for an individual or organisation\u00a0to be able to become a paying customer or client? Try small experiements based on your own research and document how things go between now and next week. At next weeks google hangout we'll get personal\u00a0feedback from (name of someone credible here) about each of our individual \u00a0strategies and how we could maybe improve them\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3>Creating relevant contexts that you're geniunely excited about!</h3>\n\nI was going through the edgeryders.eu website ahead writing this post. And I realised that, a lot of this part of the work has already been done. Huh? We have loads of really high quality content and reflections, an event which is gathering some really awsome people and even some session proposals! What we need is to connect the hard questions prospective customers would be asking with the solutions found in the many threads, conversations, and activities which offer solutions or at least paths worth exploring together in search of answers. And somewhere where all of this comes together.\n\n<h3>\u00a0</h3>\n\n<h3>Saving time by presenting clear options for working together early on</h3>\n\nHow do we productify the tracks so we generate resources to pay for the work of building and following up high quality community events? How do we enable participants to use them to personally initiate new relationships and sell track related work to clients to generate revenue for themselves?\n\nFor the product i've put together this table as a first rough sketch to have something to base the offers on that we know we can deliver :) (for each client you have in mind we'll need to do design pricing, packaging, communication for the one that you think is most relevant)\n\n\u00a0BasicExtensiveCustomisedTailor made\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Pricing: </strong>One off / Subscription- one off, short term, long term</div>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<div>Training &amp; upskilling</div>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Communication and collaboration skills\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Writing for online engagement\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reading and making sense of online data\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Building thriving policy-oriented communities online\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Social media training\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0workshops and master classes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<div>Services</div>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<div>Customised Action Research Tracks at events</div>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Networking assistance\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Research, articles, reports and books\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consulting hours\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proactive alerts\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<div>Tools &amp; technologies</div>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in situ network analysis\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in situ ethnographic analysis\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0social software\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<div>Events (we need better names for the categories of events)</div>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Large swarm-organised gathering (online, offline)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0narrow scale facilitated exploration (online, offline)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0match making &amp; collaboration kickoffs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<h3>\u00a0</h3>\n\n<h3>Getting word out to hundreds of thousands about what's on offer</h3>\n\nNow it's time to look at how to how to speed up the sales cycle, how to make it so that for each sale new customers with a probelm we can solve can find us and pay us to help them. So far my strategy has been to do outreach through keynotes that are recorded, one to one interaction, videos etc. Let's get creative about this and put our collective intelligence to work!\n\nFirst of all how do we align our own incentives and online behaviours so we are supporting one another's ability to generate revenue?\n\n<strong>Lecture</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Social Capital: why it matters and how to build it (45 mins) [Bert-Ola, would you be up for holding this talk?]\n\n<strong>Break</strong>\u00a0(15 mins)\n\n<strong>Workshop</strong>: the Edgeryders software and community members online and offline presence as a platform for generating visibility and opportunities for individual members.

This to point are fundamental to allow people to <strong>interact</strong> and <strong>participate</strong>, with different levels of depth, with MANIFETSO2020.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Why a multidisciplinary team?</strong>\n\nBecause of the complexity of contemporary society. It requires multi-thematic approaches, capable of triggering processes of change, even outside the project itself.\n\nLooking at the profiles of people who have already joined MANIFETSO2020 we can see how this desire has been caught, and we hope that additional nominations may expand the group, implementing new knowledge and additional points of view.\n\nBriefly, we believe that contemporary society is complex, not complicated, and we think that the real challenge consist in improve the way to read it and interpreting\u00a0 it correctly, with particular attention on finding the resources to be able to work effectively.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>How do we deal with this complexity?</strong>\n\nLooking for the real needs of the population, working on positioning Manifetso2020 half way between citizens and policy makers.\u00a0Each tool, each single project conceived and realized from the group is the result of a process that starts from the \"local demand\" and arrives, after the construction of those multidisciplinary teams and after a series of moments of comparison and evaluation together with the Scientific Committee, to the construction of a network of resources (often heterogeneous) willing to realize the project, looking for a win \u2013 win strategy.\n\nMANIFETSO2020 believes on <strong>building processes from the bottom</strong> in order to activate a <strong>urban re-generation</strong> who can promote a real change within the city of Trieste. Processes that take into account the existence of a new class of disadvantaged, which even the members themselves are part of Team MANIFETSO2020 and that has been defined, experimentally, the term \"luxury unemployed\".\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe team MANIFETSO2020 decided to determine needs asking to fill in an anonymous questionnaire splitting targets in two: first 18 -30 years old and in a second moment over 30. Within three months nearly 2,000 responses were obtained (about 1% of the population). The analysis of information (in collaboration with the Trieste SWG) helped the group to understand which were the main topic/issues to focus.\n\nIn the questionnaire we asked the participant to think of themselves in 2020 and to concentrate on what happened during the past 10 years. What changed for better, who where the groups who received more attention, which were the neighborhoods that improved their public services and facilities.\n\nIn this way our aim was to give the chance to participants to be more constructive and to identify solution better than problems. All the data has been <strong>published on line</strong>, \u00a0on local media magazines and on a special magazine, for free, around the city so that either citizens and policy makers could follow responces and think about projects.\n\nMore sections within the site at:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.manifetso2020.com/M2020PROVA/QUESTIONARI.html\">http://www.manifetso2020.com/M2020PROVA/QUESTIONARI.html</a>\n\n<strong>The project we are developing:</strong>\n\n<strong>'Si pu\u00f2 fare' ( 'We can do it'):</strong>\u00a0The problem identified in the survey was the low attention on promoting starting private and public iniziatives. Building a <strong>fast radio format</strong>, direct and concise, giving the possibility to a large number of people to promote their own ideas and project as example of best practices capable of a social change and in changing the current local situation. With the radio program such ideas can have a greater opportunity to be heard, enhanced through a series of suggestions from the audience and maybe, why not, find the money to be made in the shortest possible time. In addition, during each episode of the radio program, we present an unused or underused building. The program goeas on air each tuesday from a independent local radio station\n\n<strong>M2020COLLECTIVE: </strong>bring together into a single <strong>digital platform</strong> with a global reach all the best <strong>artists and creative</strong> related to different art disciplines who for various reasons \"gravitate\" around the city of Trieste. In this way one hand we try to facilitate mutual understanding of such excellence as a function of future collaborations, on the other we collect contacts with potential customers (local and international), who will find from a single site all the information needed to get in touch with them.\n\n<strong>AGENDA21:\u00a0</strong>A series of <strong>workshops</strong> in local high school to help students understand strenght/ weaknesses, potential / criticalities, necessary skills / willingness of a possible choice after the conclusion of their course of study. Making them work in a way that has become standard practice within the universities and university offering the opportunity to converse with a number of young professionals who have followed different paths of growth and employment, it is hoped to increase the information available to these students, so that when he finished high school are more knowledgeable about possible ways forward.\n\n<strong>CATALOGO SPAZI OPPORTUNITA':\u00a0</strong>One of the biggest issue underlieed by the responces of the survey was the severe situation of way to many buildings or entire neighbohoods in city: completely abandoned or not used at their best and efficient possibility. The <strong>catalogue</strong>'s mission is to accelerate the building rehabilitation and job placement in these structures.\u00a0The project will <strong>produce quantitative and qualitative analysis</strong>, preparatory to a <strong>cataloging</strong> of unused or underused buildings, highlighting the potential and weaknesses of each single case, in relation to the possibility of its <strong>functional recovery</strong>. The results, the <strong>map</strong> ,will be included in a public web platform internationally accessible. At the same time will be tested a series of techniques and <strong>methodologies of urban regeneration</strong> by applying appropriate software such as the investigation of spatial syntax.\n\nLater <strong>meetings</strong> will be organized participatory forums which we call restricted opportunities for stakeholders who will be interested in being involved in the process of urban regeneration. These meetings will aim to meet in a <strong>synergistic and complementary </strong>way<strong> resources </strong>of all those involved so as to realize the intersection between supply and demand.\n\nIn this early stage of the project of CATALOGO DEGLI SPAZI OPPORTUNITA' we are posting<strong>every day\u00a0</strong>on Facebook\u00a0\u00a0one building either identified by us or by people who wants to be involved.

subject, often appearing in the abstract or as a place for divergent thinking - the time has come now to concretely pin down what we mean by \u2018unMonastery in-a-box\u2019 and begin to produce it.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to gather together an overview for everything that\u2019s been produced and thought about to date, if you have other documents please add to the list below.\n\n## Why do we need this?\n\nunMonastery since it\u2019s birth has been predicated on the idea of easy replication, in order to give rise to a network of spaces - at least conceptually this thinking is heavily indebted to the hackerspace model. Hackerspaces replicate through <a href=\"http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Design_Patterns\">Design Patterns</a> this is a good way to go but a little sterile for the unMonastery vision.\n\nIn order to even begin to call our prototype a success for the future development and spread of unMonastery we need to unload, decant and further distill the knowledge we have generated in Matera about how the model functions. What we produce needs to be highly accessible, replicable and forkable.\n\n## What is it?\n\nSo, after much deliberation, I think it\u2019s important we start by creating strong foundations that can thrive off simplicity - rather than the deeply complex intentions previously envisioned for a sort of Github for hardware/social space. I do think though that it would be good for it to literally fit in a box.\n\n### The Key Components:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Stack of Cards [See <a href=\"http://methodkit.com/\">Methodkit</a>]</li>\n\n<li>Wiki [Capable of being printed with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PediaPress\">PediaPress</a>]</li>\n\n<li>The Book of Mistakes</li>\n\n<li>The Protocol 1.0 (NOTE: proper validation of rules into Protocol is a long, brain- and computation-intensive process. At the time of the second unMon instantiation we can hope at best for a set of <i>candidate</i> rules)</li>\n\n<li>Tech Stack [Software Installed on Raspberry Pi and OS image on USB]</li>\n\n<li>Talking Piece</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe basic concept for creating meaningful relationships between each component will be predicated on the depth of reference needed by the user / unMonasterian. Methodkit has demonstrated itself to be an effective store of knowledge that can be used effectively in face to face collaboration to build a project (also see <a href=\"http://www.methodkit.com/how-to-use/\">How To Use MethodKit</a>)\n\nSince existing MethodKits have to date focused on gathering knowledge into one place for existing disciplines or projects, there hasn\u2019t been a need for a place to store all the knowledge, since generally it\u2019s easily accessible from a google search. For unMonastery this is where the wiki comes in - each card will directly reference a wiki page.\n\nEach wiki page will contain at least a description of how we do things in Matera, with well linked references to EdgeRyder discussions and trello cards (everything useful in google docs should also be migrated to the wiki). Ideally each page should also contain: Design Pattern, alternatives approaches, Metadata (i.e how long was this tested for, who was involved etc), templates, related software, the relevant protocol/rule, relevant mistakes, videos and other pieces of information specific to each area.\n\nThese two elements will be the initial building blocks for the box. On top of this comes The Book of Mistakes and The Protocol.\n\nIn terms of the tech stack, @marc has put together an initial scope of what might be included. Principally though we\u2019d like to assess and include a set of technologies that match the way we have been accounting, managing resources and communicating. With a view to lowering the operational costs for initial setup and reducing debate around one piece of software over another. Everything though will be open-source.\n\n## Going Forward\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Hold a meeting at 18:00 on Monday 23rd at unMon to discuss.</li>\n\n<li>Establish a weekly community call for remote participation - and establish an <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmonastery-away-team-edgeryders-answer-to-amplified-teams\">amplified team</a></li>\n\n<li>Following the amplified team <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmonastery-away-team-edgeryders-answer-to-amplified-teams\">approach</a> use the top of this wiki to give updates on progress going forward and calls to action.</li>\n\n<li>24th Deploy Wiki</li>\n\n<li>Aim to have a complete list of initial card titles by 5th of July, with definition of wiki format and accompanying content migrated.</li>\n\n<li>14th Produce whole card deck in single sprint.</li>\n\n<li>By end of July produce single serving page to explain and easily share unMo in-a-box</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n## Links\n\n<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/replicating-unmonastery-pattern-languages-and-unmonastery-in-a-box\">Replicating unMonastery: Pattern languages and unMonastery in-a-box</a> [LOTE3 Session]\n\n<span><a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/replicating-unmonastery-session-documentation\">Replicating unMonastery : session documentation</a> [LOTE3 Documentation]\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JfbtQbWUNOO79E1l8WT3wEakOmhKI4EzAjt8Bi9SHiE/edit\">Nominet Application</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DZHSbcne4lX5zfUXo9gL3dEXFyMzs9Lyi_dJQoAYv3A/edit\">Nominet Toolkit Notes</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wCPl1QM99lmYwzNGjoTS4pRLOsNcX4eVCL1CQ363ayg/edit\">Initial Patterns for unMonastery</a>\n\n<a href=\"/t/the-quest-for-protocol-1-0-testing-unmonastic-life-myself/3052\">The Protocol 1.0 </a>\n\nunMonastery in-a-box Methodkit working doc [Missing, will find]\n\n<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmon-in-a-box/it-infrastructure\">unMon in-a-box / IT Infrastructure</a>\n\n<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmonastery-away-team-edgeryders-answer-to-amplified-teams\">unMonastery and EdgeRyders - Amplified Teams</a>\n\nALL THE KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORIES: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&amp;authuser=0#folders/0B6gVU-928vbCUmNWeDRoZjZzZTQ\">Google Folder</a> / <a href=\"https://trello.com/unmonastery\">Trello</a> / <a href=\"https://unmonastery-unmonastery.pbworks.com/w/home\">Pbworks</a>", "created_at": "2014-06-20 17:32:00", "updated_at": "2018-05-28 16:42:52.226195", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 982, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 65.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8645, "user_id": 3559, "topic_id": 3817, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Let's Adore and Endure</b>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6108/6384256009_35c4928268_z.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 415px;\">\n\nEach Other", "created_at": "2014-10-20 06:02:24", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 23:09:30.732613", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31540, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2628, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>no</b>\n\n<span>online offline mixes rarely ever work. so we are not doing this</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-22 15:45:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.372547", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19340, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3408, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Projects. projects, projects</b>\n\nI completely agree with the focus on projects.

It is true that there are some great examples and initiatives taking place in Calabria, Apulia, Sicily, Campania and Basilicata... but let's not forget that Casa Netural is the first co-working space that opened in Basilicata - and it's not even one year old.\u00a0\n\nI don't even want to go near the language issue (it seems like english is just perfect for describing and speaking about innovation and collaboration): how come in Italian we are always taking english words to speak about <em>changemakers</em>, <em>digital media marketing</em>, <em>social media strategist</em>,\u00a0<em>community management </em>and so forth (you basically just have to read them out loud with a bit of an Italian accent).\n\nWhat I want to address here is the spirit behind the sharing economy: it's based on collaboration, sense of community, reciprocity, scarse resources, jobless but skilled people, ecc.ecc. Well, doesn't \"the South \" represent, in general opinion,\u00a0the place of reciprocity, community, sharing, familiarity, ecc? Moving away from stereotypes, how come that the European\u00a0country that has the highest number of young NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training), and the regions that in the past years have lost a great number of youngsters (the number has grown of more than 400% in the past years, Alma Laurea) seem to be marginal in the debate on sharing economy?\u00a0\n\nIt strikes me how urban agricultural practices are exploding in London and pick up so slowly in the South, that collaborative services are being designed in Milan and systemizing practices that in the South are so common. It reminds me when in a discussion in Matera I was speaking about Casa Netural with enthusiasm, and a friend of mine answered with a tinge of resentment mixed with disapproval \"the guy is just making money on practices that we do for free\" - meaning that co-working and co-living is just another name to call something that - it is true - we had been doing for the past years. Opening your house to colleagues and friends to live and work together.\u00a0\n\n<span>Matt's sentence got me thinking: \"every resonably sized city can be a great place for Edgeryders\". But can it really? Matera is only just starting to discover \"collaborative services\", but collaboration is something that has always existed. It is now taking\u00a0other forms (some very service-oriented and well designed) and being expressed through a dense narrative that has to be channeled to places that know little about all this.\u00a0</span>\n\nAlthough I know that my distorted passion for the South of Italy does bring me to enhance sometimes exceedingly the specificites of these regions, I still think that this gap between areas that seem so ripe for collaboration and other zones has to be tackled. It is not only about language. It is not only about entrepreneurial spirit. I believe a lot has got to do with the digital divide (very little internet access), not knowing that all this is possible and the fact that a lot of these practices are in the dna of the people who cannot understand why one would \"design services\" on them.\n\nBut there is more to it and I would love to know what your take on it is.\n\nThanks for your attention :)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-17 14:43:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:34.073895", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 666, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18294, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 4653, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>community gathering</b>\n\nwe hoped to get them to the community gathering, but alas! would love to meet with them though!\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-18 08:48:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:42.182526", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 24, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17324], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12169, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1289, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Great, I'll check them out and get back to you soon.\n\nThanks for adding me on Academia.edu !\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-24 10:45:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:09.566563", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15670, "user_id": 360, "topic_id": 1242, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Thanks!

I am very interested in job opportunity, and think that with my skills I could be an asset to your mission.\n\nI would like to stress that I am a very diligent person who takes work seriously, and have international experience. Having covered different topics in my ninteen-year career in media and journalism has moulded me in being versatile, a fast learner and a very good listener.\n\nI have worked at the leading newspaper in Egypt, Al Ahram Daily since 2005, and my experience goes beyond working in Al Ahram. This passion that I have for journalism has greatly enriched me, especially in news reporting and editing, it also gave me the opportunity to travel to other countries like Lebanon, Syria, Kazakhstan, Malta, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Thailand and France. In some of these countries I have established strong contacts with the local media.\n\nAs a journalist I am used to gathering information and efficiently and succinctly packaging it in various formats. Gathering background information and documentation, putting together briefing and presentation materials are second nature to me. I have also learned to effectively manage and file this information and have a deep and committed understanding of the need for confidentiality and the protection of sources and source material.\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\"Journalism is more than a profession for me; it is part of my life\" :)\n\n</blockquote>\n\nI also worked as Web Manager and Social Media Strategist for Sweden's official website in Arabic <a href=\"http://ar.sweden.se\">http://ar.sweden.se</a> at the Swedish Institute I performed in principal all the key functions noted under points one through four.\n\nAs the only member of the project team based in Egypt I have had responsibility for all contacts and follow-ups with local vendors, both financial and practical. I prepared the budget, developed the contacts database, calendar and events schedule and organised the workshops both in Egypt and regionally. I have also given lectures at these events. I have developed and written the communication channels for the project in both Arabic and English and have given regular statistical, strategic and tactical reports on a monthly basis.\n\nLately I worked as Web Manager and Social Media Strategist for OneWorld Uk\u2019s awareness raising project on sexual and reproductive health in Egypt - <a href=\"http://ma3looma.net\">http://ma3looma.net</a>.\n\nI worked as a social media consultant for the European Training Foundation (ETF), an agency of the European Union. I Developed a social media campaign to present a model to show how policymakers and ETF experts can use social media to draw conclusions from, share knowledge around and learn from each other about how evidence can improve policymaking.\n\nThe social media campaign I designed for the (ETF), won the international IABC's Gold Quill Merit Award and EMErald Award 2011. This was the first time an EU body received such a prestigious award.\n\nI have experience with various aspects of social media, including: online video platforms, blogging platforms, viral marketing, Twitter &amp; microblogging, and Social networking (esp. Facebook, LinkedIn). I have a deep practical and theoretical knowledge of customizing brand monitoring strategies. Enjoys working in dynamic environments. Strong interpersonal skills and works well with others. Good communicator and excellent writer.

The paper by <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Cowen\">Tyler Cowen</a>, from George Mason University, Department of Economics, is entitled '<strong>An economic and rational choice approach to the autism spectrum and human neurodiversity'</strong>. <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1975809\">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1975809</a>\n\nTyler Cowen edits a blog about economy called <a href=\"http://marginalrevolution.com/\">Marginal Revolution</a>.\n\nThis paper focuses on cases of autism. But we can see that the economic approach applied to autistic individuals can be extended to other neurodiverse individuals (such as the Kundalini individuals). As there are no studies yet about what the Kundalini people are better at, and what kind of jobs would suit them most, this paper can serve as a comparative reference?\n\nThere is even a chapter about 'the happiness of autistics'. The kundalini are in a state of bliss. But nonetheless can be affected by unemployment...\n\nFrom the chapter about the economic discrimination, '<em>The segregation of autistics into categories, based on the labels of outside observers, may increase the overall earnings risk and job satisfaction risk associated with being autistic</em>.'\n\nSome excerpts:\n\nAutistics therefore will have higher earning potential, relative to non-autistics, in a wealthier and larger economy. It is easier for them to find the specialized jobs which they excel at and easier to make a good living from those jobs. To put this in more concrete terms, it is on average easier for an autistic to be a highly specialized surgeon than to be a general practitioner. It is easier for an autistic to be a crop scientist rather than running a large farm, again relative to non-autistics. The economic insights of Adam Smith thus imply relative optimism about the future for many neurodiverse individuals, including autistics.\n\nNote that as economic growth proceeds, the highest earners among autistics may not be the \u201cmild\u201d autistics but rather they may be the \u201cextreme\u201d autistics.\n\nNeuroeconomics can start with what scientists already know about cross-sectional variation in human neurologies. That is, we can consider atypical individuals whose brains are already known to be different, as discovered through testing and diagnosis. We then consider the testable implications of these neurological differences.\n\nMany neurodiverse individuals are treated badly or subject to discrimination or otherwise experience bad outcomes and there is room for improvement.\n\nThe common tendency of behavioral economics is to find a bias and assume it holds across all or most individuals. An alternative approach seeks to explain when the bias is present or not and that requires a focus on human diversity, including neurodiversity.\n\nA cognitive profile approach defines autism in terms of how autistic brains process information and how those methods differ from the information processing of nonautistic brains. The outcomes will depend on how autistic cognitive profiles interact with varying environments.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-27 17:59:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:48.797482", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 593, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23720, "user_id": 3143, "topic_id": 5246, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>attend</b>\n\nHey, I'd like to attend the session!\n\nSounds super interesting and I believe it will be key for the user research on the OpenCare project\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-19 12:52:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:11.666014", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 32, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [854], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3566, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 3533, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We started making sure we understand the structure and major teams coordination at Lote4.\n\n<strong>1.

Available, affordable health and social care was \u2013 and still is \u2013 unavailable. Not for some unknown person in some distant land, either. For friends and family members, people in our communities, right here. Something had to be done.\n\nWe saw people coming together, stepping into the breach. Communities were taking up the role of care providers, making it work where neither the state nor private business could. They were doing amazing things. Hackers were making open sourced, internet-enabled glucose monitors for children with diabetes. Belgian trauma therapists set up mobile studios and drove them to refugee camps in Greece, to help bereaved refugees. Bipolar 1 patients found and helped each other fight back suicidal tendencies. Biologists and biohackers were trying to invent a cheap, open source process to make insulin. American activists were encouraging each other to eat healthy food and exercise by doing it together.\n\nWe started a research projects to take a good look inside these and many other stories. We wanted to learn what these initiatives have in common, and how we could make more. That project is called OpenCare; it is now in its second year. Results are still coming through, but one thing is already clear:\n\nIt's all about humans.\n\nCommunity provision of care services needs humans:  more, better prepared, volunteers. People prepared to teach each other skills.  Therapists to help volunteers in need of trauma support. So, the highest-impact technologies are those that help bring people together. Share knowledge. Distribute human resources across different care contexts. These technologies are connectors: they help string together and coordinate human efforts.\n\nThis intuition is fundamental. It goes even beyond care. And it makes sense: we are, after all, the 99%. We have little money and power. We have no large companies, fancy foundations, prestigious universities. But we do have each other. We will thrive, if we can collaborate. But there's a problem: collaboration is expensive, and hard to monetise. So, any technology that makes it more efficient is going to make a difference.\n\n<strong>At Edgeryders, we have resolved to put this lesson into practice. We are doing it by hacking the most fundamental connecting technology of all: the home.</strong>\n\nWe dream of a new kind of space, that can be the hearth for our families but still be open to the broader world. Where the door is not a barrier to keep the world out, but a gateway to a global network. Where we can live, and work, and sometimes work with the people we live with, and live with our co-workers. Where people are welcome to stay for one day, or a lifetime. Where spending even just an hour in good heart ensures you will never be a stranger again. Where we can develop our talent, learn new skills, get better at what we do. Where we can create for each other a healthy, friendly, cosmopolitan environment and, yes, take care of each other.\n\nWe have dreamt this dream before. In its previous iteration, we called it the unMonastery. We prototyped in 2014, in the Italian city of Matera. That experience taught us much. We learned that a life/work space can not be too close to the needs of a single client. Neither can it be dependent on the grant cycle. It needs to be financially self-sustaining, and benefit several projects and lines of business. We also learned how important it is to be diverse, open and outward-looking for fresh air and fresh ideas to circulate at all times.\n\nThe unMonastery also got many things right. The most important one is this: we went ahead and tried it. Planning and due diligence are necessary, but trying things out makes for richer learning.\n\nSo, we are not going to keep dreaming about a new space. Instead, we have decided to roll out a second iteration. Right now.\n\n<strong>We are calling it The Reef.</strong>\n\nCoral reefs are structures built by tiny animals, corals. They serve as the home, anchoring point, hiding place, hunting ground to thousands of species. Algae, seaweeds, fish, molluscs all cooperate with, compete with, eat, feed each other. As they do so, they benefit the corals, who gain access to nutrients (reefs exist in nutrient-poor tropical waters).\n\nLike coral reefs, our new space will draw strength from diversity and symbiosis. Different people will bring in different skills, access to different networks, different personalities. And Edgeryders itself (a social enterprise, so a creature of a different species) will live in symbiosis with the space and the individuals that live in it. It will pay rent, subsidising those who live there; in return, it will be able to use the space for its own purposes: office, coworking space, venue for small events. We also want to offer some form of access to a broad network of people right from the start.\n\nWe ran the numbers and we are sure we can make it work.\n\n<strong>We are going to start with a small-scale prototype: a Brussels loft, with four bedrooms, common living area, office, courtyard. </strong>@Noemi , @Nadia and @Alberto are going to be full-time residents; one more room will host temporary residents. We are going live on May 1st 2017, and try it out for one year. We are already looking for a (much) larger space to move into in spring 2018 if the experiment goes well.\n\n<strong>If you are considering being part of the experiment, or curious about learning more, get in touch. We are planning a \"building the Reef\" track within to OpenVillage where we, together, will design the physical space, its financing model, and the activites therein \u2013 from business to fitness and personal development.

The ability to do foresight, and learn from foresight done by others has to be forged. So we decided to launch an experiment together: a collective learning journey on using the future.\n\nWe have identified five waypoints on the way to <strong>futures literacy</strong> \u2013 each of them an ability itself. For each waypoint, we invite you the participant to share relevant experiences and lessons learned from your work and life. Participants submit articles and for each waypoint and we all come together in an online discussion facilitated by wise and remarkable hosts who are selected on the basis of their domain knowledge and experience. The process is designed for each participant to come away with a deeper understanding of critical skills and abilities they need, and how they can acquire or develop them within their respective organisations and fields.\n\nThe first ability is the ability to <strong>learn to look beyond one's construction of reality</strong>.\n\nThe second ability is the ability to <strong>understand that the outlook on the future is contestable ground,\u00a0and why that matters for the present</strong>.\n\nThe third ability is the ability to <strong>think like a complexity scientist</strong>, leaving behind narrativised accounts of reality and teaching oneself to recognise emergence\u00a0and self-organisation.\n\nThe fourth ability is the ability to <strong>learn from others already using the future</strong>.\n\nThe fifth ability is the ability to <strong>manage the tension between the need for sense-making and the need to act</strong>.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\"><strong>Who is this for?</strong></h3>\n\nOne sentence that will capture attention of the people you wish to reach and engage.

Turns out they are in early stages of planning for a pilot in Uganda, but not soon enough for our purposes. Maybe further down the line, but not now. Ah, well. (They are pretty solid but their approach takes time.)\n\nNext contact point in my slow (sorry) list is permaculturists. <a href=\"http://www.permacultureglobal.com/users?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;search=uganda&amp;commit=Search&amp;type=&amp;climate_zone=\">http://www.permacultureglobal.com/users?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;search=uganda&amp;commit=Search&amp;type=&amp;climate_zone=</a> shows some contacts. 14 profiles, of which one is repeated. Maybe there could be a way for some of you to meet there? (I don't know them.) Nearby countries?\n\nThe third thing I'd like to do is to try and look at some permacultural design elements and possibilities. I'm not an expert at all: took an online course, nothing else. But maybe if we know some of the starting point elements (the coordinates for a piece of land that's similar to the ones that will be available, what plants and animals you plan to have, and the data you've already provided), maybe I might look into what other elements might go in the mix for mutual benefit. I can't at all guarantee that I'll be able to come up with anything, but I'd like to give it a try. Permaculture is about questions, and maybe I can ask my silly amateur questions and you can build on that? I'll take a random plot and look at climate, rains, soil, etc. There are links to what the soil is like and so on. I'll add what I find.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.GeoffLawton.com\">http://www.GeoffLawton.com</a>'s new course (an enhanced repetition of the one I took last year) starts again soon, and I'll want to ask my fellow students. Maybe Geoff himself. I'll be some noise among maybe two thousand online students.\n\nFinally, and this ends what I can think of regarding growing food right now (and I know permaculture is not just about that, but food does matter), maybe there's help in appropedia.org, akvo.org, globalswadeshi.net, and outofpoverty.com (some ideas about helping others to grow food, rather than just growing your own? all helps!).\n\n(More help in <a href=\"http://www.wwoof.net/\">http://www.wwoof.net/</a> ?

I fear that we often superficially oversimplifying things to promote ourselves without realizing/measuring/acknowledge the possible positive or negative\u00a0impact it may have.\n\nI've never been to Senegal so I have to use imagination to analyze the story.

This big Island to the right of \u00a0Africa hosts20 million people, the majority still living under \u00a01 \u00a3 a day. They have a lot of opportunities which still need to be explored. And those opportunities are in the hand of the future generations who need some rejuvenation.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMalagasy parents used to tell stories and legends to give wisdom, advice and knowledge to their children. When there were some schools appearing they thought that a story is not enough to raise their own child. Wisdom came before knowledge for Malagasy people. As Malagasy are saying \"Let your behavior be like a tree: if the roots are strong enough, leaves can shake as they want.\" \u00a0Parents decided to send children to school and encourage them to go further as long as they can support them. In fact having a son or daughter graduate from University is an honor for parents and children, it means that both are successful. In that time, to accept a job opportunity easily, leaving the familial cid and flying with their own wings is easier.\n\nNowadays, child education is a must until the 6th grade, to be exact. Knowing how to count, writing one\u2019s name or read, that's enough in some suburban places. Somewhere in the South of Madagascar kids have to travel 3 hours through village or dunes. Sometimes walking 15 km from school and going back and forth, sometimes students get a half day of school. There has never been a bus school or transport, and even if students get a student car they don't get reduction.\u00a0\n\nIt's happened that teachers don't get paid for three months, become lazy and don't teach classes. Sometime parents and someone in charge on school find a solution, telling parents to give some amount of money or telling his child to bring some rice for the canteen. In small villages school is far, college and high school is even farther, University is more in the province.\u00a0\n\nIt's happened also that parents are less educated and don't know how to guide the child, in fact the essential for the children is to manage their own life insurance.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Graduating from University doesn't make sense anymore for young people.\u00a0</strong>\n\nAs a young Malagasy person I know where we have been, but I don't know where are going...\u00a0\n\nAfter finishing your studies you need to line up behind millions of jobless for a job opportunity. \u00a0After investigation ; Many those young people\u00a0struggle and move on the street working as a \"taxi phone\" mobile cheap call, bus driver, gold digger... any available job in general. Some get influenced by easy money called \"bizna\":\u00a0it means selling anything, from a friend or relative, like cell phones, computers, tyres, cars.\u00a0Those who have funds to run their business can invest into something short term or permanent like restaurants, jewelry, imports etc.\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s talk about it: 67 % of Malagasy people are about 15 to 25 years young. \u00a0Statistically 15 % of graduates get an exact job for the position that they prepared for in University, 65% remain jobless and 10 % know someone high placed and get to work for an unsuitable job and that they don't have any idea what it is about or how to do; about the last 5% have something \u00a0planned for, and finally the 5% remaining help \u00a0parents at home. Many foreign companies like to employ people from Sri Lanka or Indonesia because they are more skilled and less corrupted... We have more and more foreigners who are coming here to get rich. It's also another gate for economy and illnesses from both sides.\u00a0\n\nThere are some good things in progress.\u00a0Recently I met some people from Christian missionary\u00a0called ADRA \"Adventist Development and Relief Agency\" \u00a0using techniques to improve farming for those who have land or what to farming it was only a campaign. NGOs like USAID who have been here since 32 years to help Malagasy people to realize goals of development, recover from natural disaster like cyclones, health care like malnutrition, sponsoring on project used to be only for educational like \"youth and reproduction\", \u00a0\"Youth against HIV\". But it's only in the capital or on a regional campaign for few times and not long enough to be remembered by people. They are trying to give free training, help and support for young people in suburban areas but ... sometime with no success . Youth Volunteers like Peacecorps almost every year whose giving free teaching, help and give some supplies like pen and copy book, chalkboard \u00a0etc.. if they have something to give.\u00a0\n\nAll those things are looking good for a while, but they have no impact on their lifetime. There is no precise political with systematization or screening. There is not enough community who cares especially for young Malagasy. Insecurity, infrastructure and corruption are principal factors which still exist since long time and drag in deep water the majority of those young people. When I was asking them to give their thoughts, they say: \" We felt abandoned by the government, they only thinking about how to full they pockets. As we learned from school: \"I\" is going first and \"YOU\" is after, that\u2019s how people in government are thinking. Our daily duty is to wake-up, go outside chilling with friends, and go back home at lunch time\u201d.\n\nFinally, Malagasy people cannot lean on their own government, it doesn\u2019t have enough budget to overcome this or: the budget is going somewhere else which is more important, like towards health. Private school is plenty even if some of them don't have the right character as a normal school: no playing ground, no gates... Parents like it because the teaching method is quite modern and up to date, teachers are quite professional. \u00a0Some of those private schools belong to someone on the Government. The good thing is that teachers in private schools are at least able to do their job smoothly and actually finish school programs.\u00a0\n\nMalagasy people still believe that education is the best legacy.\u00a0\n\n<strong>How do you find ways to make a living as a young generation which government does not care for ? </strong>\n\n<strong>Please go\u00a0ahead, ask questions and add your comments :)</strong>\n\n<em>The production of this\u00a0article was supported by\u00a0<a href=\"/opencarefellowships\">Op3n\u00a0Fellowships</a>\u00a0-\u00a0an ongoing program for community contributors\u00a0during May - November 2016.</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-17 20:27:51", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 11:46:10.549647", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1172, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 55.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16663, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 4746, "post_number": 3, "raw": "We also appear as validated (Yeaah!!) in the platform, but we did'nt received any mail.\n\nI'll go through the PLSIGN thing..\n\n", "created_at": "2015-08-25 10:26:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.221132", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17902, "user_id": 3440, "topic_id": 734, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Reply</b>\n\nHi Bernard,\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks for your interest for our work and model.\n\nOf course there's certainly room for export of some tools, trainings or even more...

Over the months of August and September, Edgeryders have reviewed papers on several transition issues, putting forward additional content or signaling key vulnerable points.  THANK YOU! to everyone who took the time and patience to help. <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/beckery\">Rebecca Collins</a> is almost done putting together the handbook (to be shared online), and she'll make sure to acknowledge all contributors: first and foremost the entire Edgeryders community, and special thanks to those of you giving direct feedback.\n\nMost papers conclude with recommendations to reform European youth policy, but a recurring question kept popping up ever since \\#LOTE and \\#edgecamp meetups and more so after sharing our research: <strong>How to move forward? How can these recommendations become real courses of action? </strong>\n\nSome of you voiced concern over the possibility of the handbook being yet another not-far-reaching-and-concrete instrument, talk (however sensible and informed) rather than action. We share that concern. So we are challenging ourselves, the Edgeryders community (that would be you) and the European policy community to work together. We are asking you, ourselves and everyone we know to collaboratively produce a list of policy measures so pragmatic, grounded in experience and well-designed that they are impossible to dismiss on the grounds that they are unrealistic or technically unsound. It's hard, we know.\n\nWe are going to do it anyway. We simply cannot afford to aim any lower \u2013 in the face of the present, many-faceted crisis too much is at stake. And we think it can be done. It's just hard, not impossible. But to do it, we need to combine two very different skill sets: that of Edgeryders \u2013 the young, radical changemakers \u2013 and that of policy wonks \u2013 the \"system integrators\" of new things into the existing institutional plumbing.\n\n<strong>Want to help? Here's how.</strong> We'd like to set up a working meeting in November (details will be announced in the forthcoming week) that will bring together members from the community, policy workers, innovators and life hackers to flesh out concrete proposals and sharpen the question of how institutions can make it easier for citizens to access resources or spaces they need to work together, innovate and implement creative solutions.\n\nHere is an open ended, work-in-progress list of solutions that anyone can contribute to, so come join us! <strong> [click here to participate, instructions for funded travel etc.]</strong>. If there's anything you think should be in the list of solutions just add it<em>.</em>  It's basically preparatory work and research for the meetup.\n\n<em>\n\n</em>\n\n\u00a0", "created_at": "2012-10-03 18:29:53", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 16:54:56.723653", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 478, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9311, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6052, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Very cool! </b>\n\nThanks, @Nadia , this is really great learning.

The wave of increasing violence that followed caused tourism and foreign business activity to decline and makes investors reluctant to start business activity in Egypt.<strong> </strong></span>\n\n<span><strong>In effect, the unemployment rate increased from 8.9% (2010) to 12% (2016).</strong> Unemployment disproportionately affects youth especially women; unemployed youth (15-24) reached 33% in 2016 , 45%  of them are female and 29% male ( [ILO data](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.1524.ZS?locations=EG)) </span>\n\nBesides the current inflation which reached 29.6 % in January 2017 ( [Capmas](http://www.capmas.gov.eg/Pages/ShowHmeNewsPDF.aspx?page_id=/Admin/News/PressRelease/20172118232_CPI%201-2017.pdf&Type=News ) ) This _\"sharp increases in (food) inflation is likely to limit poverty reduction and negative short-term effects could be felt across different income levels.\" (_[Worldbank](http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/egypt/overview))\n\n\n\n<span><strong>With unemployment comes labor migration: 39% of the unemployed intend to migrate abroad </strong>.</span> Also, high corruption was cited as something that causes the costs of doing business to be often prohibitively high. Employers complain about the quality of technical professional education, and the work ethic of the young.\n\n<strong>But aren't we missing something very important in this picture? Especially if we are interested in exploring solutions?</strong>\n\n<span><strong>The<span> employment statistics of the formal economy usually do not fully acknowledge the existence of the underground economy</span></strong><span> (\u201cSystem D\u201d), which comes with its own set of challenges and solutions. Since unemployment affects the young disproportionately, it could be worth a look what unorthodox solutions to economic exclusion they try and find</span></span>.\n\n<strong>Over time a kind of consensus has emerged amongst some Edgeryders community members that we need to look for other safety nets.</strong> That governments ceased being able to fullfill that promise a long time ago. Perhaps even that the idea of a job in itself is becoming obsolete (<a href=\"/t/we-should-organize-our-society-around-something-else-that-employment/1580\">source</a>). <span>Several of us have found paths that defy convention and sometimes even the law. We can propose the broader topic of Making a Living and include questions to help us dig further into the various facets \u2013 especially to de-construct the assumptions underpinning the data collected. While these terms are often used in policy contexts, which don't necessarily tell us much about the ways individuals attach meaning to work. Or how it makes sense to respond to structural changes in our local labour markets when they are caused by forces that act on a global scale. </span>\n\n<strong>So we think it makes sense to ask other questions. </strong>\n\n<span>Like how do entrepreneurial careers of young people look when they have to start from economic exclusion? How do they find support and a market for their work, products or services, and what role does the informal economy play in that? What support (also esp. by government policies) is needed by these persons with self-managed, informal careers?</span>\n\nWe're ourselves experimenting with different approaches: we would like to compare notes with peers dealing with the issue in different parts of the world, especially in<span> Jordan</span>, <span> Lebanon</span>,<span>Morocco</span>,  and<span> Tunisia</span>. \n\n<span><strong>You know the situation on the ground where you are better than us.</strong></span>\n\n<span>Help us reach out to people running interesting initiatives we can learn from, and invite them to join us by posting a personal introduction and a story* telling us about their project [here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/openvillage/people-projects)\n\n**We are also offering fellowships as we are building the very first openvillage in MENA region.

Team UP: Pauline Schautmann (@Pauline )\u00a0and @Omri_Kaufmann </strong>are product design students at UDK in Berlin and breaking new ground in the OpenCare research by starting a deep conversation around mental and emotional health. They genuinely took their own personal experiences and turned them\u00a0into\u00a0design frames. Mental health is not easy to approach, and not once have I heard lately how sharing a deeply personal story in public feels scary. Kudos for a daring attitude:\n\n<em>Our goal is to make the complex, 'taboo' issue of mental health more tangible and approachable to the public. It aims at fostering empathy and understanding towards those that are suffering from emotional distress.

Kate Genevieve (@kate_g)\u00a0</strong>is an artist and researcher at the intersections of domains, of the physical and virtual (own worded bio\u00a0<a href=\"http://kategenevieve.com/About-Contact\">here</a>). Her approach to mental care which I liked a lot is a community rewiring of listening and offering support, <em>\"that everyone who lives in a distributed area is in someway involved in processing the emotions experienced in that place\".</em> I\u2019m hoping her piece will explore connection to inhabited spaces, using the digital as a space for honesty - more details to come.\n\n<em>Real-life conversations from real experience in which neither party is an expert can be life changing. I work a lot with VR and seeing through another's eyes is certainly helpful but what really leads to change is honestly communicating difficult experience and listening to others and accepting their experience. There's some sort of validation in the honesty of that process that allows for shifts. There are lots of CBT, brain training, \"look at things brighter\" apps around but perhaps there's room for bold digital networks - with some serious legal tick boxes in place - that make possible structured honest relational experiences between people in a particular place</em>. - Kate in her <a href=\"/t/notes-from-community-call-on-emotional-health-and-possibly-inappropropriate-conversation/5625/4\">thoughtful contribution</a>.\n\n<strong>2.

I have a feeling this is no longer a student assignment, as they confessed to really enjoy hanging out there, making friends and throwing dinner parties. If you read their piece below, you\u2019ll see that the people they talked to are called by a name and are not just \u201cvolunteer\u201d or \u201crefugee\u201d. As the scouting progresses for creative activities and ideas to put people\u2019s skills to good use during the long wait in the camp, the team came up with insights that only make us want to learn more: <em>We have been visiting a refugee camp in Berlin and had the chance to get in touch with a number of the people there. It seems like most projects with refugees focus on families and children, whereas the young men are being left out (<a href=\"/t/home-sweet-home/648\">Home Sweet Home</a>).</em>\n\nSo there they are, our Op3nCare Fellows. They are the first to explore community led care in depth, aided by a small financial reward and learning opportunities in 2016-2017 (more about our ongoing Fellowship program <a href=\"/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296\">here</a>). Everyone, feel free to dive in the readings and say hello. Up until July 1st community members and new Edgeryders are welcome to join the conversation and submit <a href=\"/en/op3ncare/helping-one-another-to-discover-what-is\">Op3nCare stories</a>.

It is probably easier to do it as a community than for individual edgeryders \u2013 many of us travel often, but rural Uganda is a more advanced kind of travel. We can launch a discussion on that; just now we are rolling out a spectacular social media team, and I am sure that [saidhamideh], [Daniel Vaarik] and [Dorotea Mar] will find this sort of stuff quite exciting to communicate.\n\nBut I was actually thinking to make a personal phone call. You know how we are working with UNDP. I actually saw some UNDPers retweet this post in the past days. I would be happy to drop a line to the people we work with, asking them if they can connect us with their colleagues in Uganda and see what they think. No promises: it's not like we have any power, we simply feel it's OK to ask.\n\nBut to do that, I need to know that there is a willingness to engage on the Ugandan side: without <a href=\"/u/ndelo_peter\">@Ndelo Peter</a> and <a href=\"/u/gracia\">@gracia</a> on board, I am just another crazy white guy to a seasoned development worker in Africa. And honestly, I can't blame them. We at Edgeryders can probably help with the lo-hi tech part, but we don't have much to offer with respect to the core of your project \u2013 running the family center. \u00a0So, if the Uganda office were to say \"well, we are listening\" it would be mostly you guys form your end running the show, though we are happy to do our part, write documents, participate in conference calls, that sort of things.\u00a0What do you think?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-27 10:27:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:03.869476", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 357, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 16.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10617], "is_liked_by": [1818], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3898, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3865, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>Over the past few weeks Nico, Daniele, Riel and I have been collaborating on this \"corporate\" video for Unesco:</span>\n\n<span>https://player.vimeo.com/video/110723009 </span>\n\nNotice the blue Edgeryders logo?\n\nThat's to distinguish between content we produce for ourselves as a community (red logo) <span>and work commissioned by other organisations using the Edgeryders social enterprise (blue logo).</span>\n\nIs this a new development? No. It's easy to miss this but those of us who have been part of Edgeryders development will recall that it is a path we have been on for some time now.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">The story...</h2>\n\n<strong>Two years ago <a href=\"/u/darren\">@Darren</a> proposed that we should set up a not-for-profit organisation <span> </span><span>to \"facilitate the </span><span>collaborative projects </span><span>of Edgeryders</span><span>,</span><span> helping us to</span><span> </span><span>working together effectively</span></strong><span><strong>\"</strong>. </span>\n\n<span>This sparked a really active discussion (<a href=\"/t/can-we-and-should-we-pull-off-an-official-edgeryders-organisation/1688\">90+ comment thread!</a>) and the consensus was that yes we should. </span><span>Anyone who wanted to register Edgeryders was free to do it under their own chosen\u00a0legal format, and that's how five people put ourselves forward (again with <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-should-we-morph-into-a-social-enterprise/1033\">an open call for discussion +26 comments</a>) to set up a not for profit organisation and\u00a0carry some responsibility - legal <em>and </em>towards the community in general. </span>So we registered <a href=\"/company/home\">Edgeryders LBG</a> a not for profit organisation in service of a beautifully unruly community :)\n\n<span>In short we set out to see if by pooling resources and efforts we can help one another to get more interesting, paid work and be able to support one another's projects more. Knowing full well that we were stepping out into unchartered territory and would be making a lot of mistakes along the way.</span>\n\n<span>So far it's been a promising experiment. </span><span>It has its challenges too. </span>\n\n<em><span>How to keep everything transparent without adding unreasonable workload on people already putting in a lot of volunteer work to make the opportunities happen or compromise people's privacy? How to manage the conflict between need for speedy delivery, with the time it takes for calls for participation/paid work opportunities to reach the network?</span></em>\n\n<span><span>These and many questions pop up along the way. Many of which have been explored in comments spread in the discussions that we had in setting this up. New questions and challenges continue to pop up along the way. Each new project brings with it new challenges and lessons around organising our work so we can collaborate in decentralised ways across countires, cultures and disciplines. And the more projects we do together, the more people in the community who develop these new skills that are at the edges of contemporary working practices. </span></span>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">\"Yeah but will it land me a job?\"</h2>\n\n<span><span>My hunch is that the members of this community and beyond will already be running rings around the dinosaurs by the time the market starts to realise what is going on and why these skills are so valuable. Because by then we would have had x number of years supporting one another in building meaningful, resilient initiatives...helping one another to lead lives that fulfill and sustain us. Peer to peer.</span></span>\u00a0 I believe we should be striving for more than competing over shrinking pieces of a dysfunctional labour market, and instead turn to one another in building what we need. In a <a href=\"/t/a-quote-from-slavoj-zizek/3817\">recent post</a> Matthias posted a quote from <span><span>a livechat with </span></span>Slavoj \u017di\u017eek:\n\n<em>\"The problem is effectively who is a possible agent of change today. It can no longer be the traditional working class. Because to be a traditional worker, let's say I'm employed by a big factory or company and I have a safe long term job. Ok, I am exploited, but in a stable way. This is almost a privilege today. What about permanently unemployed. What about precarious workers? What about all those living outside of our cupola, our universe? So the only agency of possible change I think can rise with the combination of all these dispossessed, marginalised and so on. Illegal immigrant workers, permanently unemployed, those living under ecological threat, the task is to somehow join all these multiple points. [\u2026]\n\n\u00a0 We should fight all our struggles, against sexism here, racism there, and so on. But we should nonetheless keep open a sense of risk. There is always a mystery in political activity. You think you are engaged in a big project and nothing comes out of it. But often you make just a small demand, and if you insist on it, everything changes. We cannot master in advance the consequences of our acts. We should act and keep our mind open.\"\"</em>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">We're already well on our way.</h2>\n\n<strong><span><span>Part of this means collectively accepting that we will not get a smooth ride</span></span>, and deciding to stick to it anyway.</strong> This means eating our own dogfood. <span><span>For \\#lote4 we decided to coordinate the work of building the event through Makerfox, the network bartering app built by <a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>. </span></span>\n\nWe will try to post paid gigs that come in through client work secured by community members on Makerfox<strong> </strong>(i.e. work done using Edgeryders LBG as the organisation handling the administration and money). If you want to encourage this development, you can help by using it yourself in coordinating work on your projects.<em> </em>The more people who help fix bugs and improve Makerfox integration with the Edgeryders community platform, the faster we can do this and scale it up (because with improved integration we would not be asking for an unreasonable amount of work from project managers). <em> If you have developer skills and are up for wrangling with Drupal, please let me know!</em>\n\n<span><span>Another important part of this working well is to harmonise expectations between everyone involved. The need for this was highlighted by several people at LOTE4 so I am currently producing a document giving an overview of Edgeryders governance for newer members of the community. If I do a good job it would be including the input from the discussions we have had on and offline, and translating what we have learned<em> from experience</em> into a shared document that is simple to understand</span></span> and implement. Expect it to be published as a wiki in early December.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">How you can help</h3>\n\n<span><span>Using an alpha or beta version of an underfunded open source platform to coordinate a complex event did make it more demanding in some ways: for example</span></span> <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a> and <a href=\"/u/natalia_skoczylas\">@Natalia_Skoczylas</a> who were coordinating the work had to <span><span>spread time across two platforms both of which are severely under-resourced</span></span> (i.e. non-smooth User experience, bugs everywhere etc).\n\nHowever, the results were really promising (see <a href=\"/t/agora/286/the-lote4-video-is-now-online-watch-it-here\">video here</a>). The quality of this year's lote was the best so far and I believe the sense of deep community forming mentioned by Dan in his <a href=\"http://oedipamaas49.livejournal.com/161188.html\">beautiful post</a> is due to everyone there having been an active participant from before the event...and having really earned this beautiful event by building it together.\n\n<em>Why don't they fix the bugs? Why don't they improve the user experience and visual design? How can I tell where to even begin when I get to the platform and why don't they figure out how to help me not get lost?\u00a0\u00a0 Why don't they run a proper newsletter goddammit? And why isn't there information about the company? And why don't they highlight some of the great people and content that is in the platform? There are so many small things they can do to take this whole thing up a notch, why don't they?</em>\n\nEverything changes when you replace \"they\" with \"we\" in the questions...\n\nWe do weekly 1 hour video conferences (google hangouts) where community members meet to catch up with what is happening in our projects and lives, give one another advice and collaborate around different projects. As well as coordinate community-related work. It's a great way to get to know and support one another.\n\nIt would be lovely to see you there on Thursday November 6 at 11:00.\n\nCome. <a

In part it's a numbers game where you need to reach very very many different people, and make it easy for them to understand what you have to offer and give them a choice of things they can buy. \n\nWhen it comes to working with consultancy in part it's a matter of going at it, being in the game long enough so that  by the time they hear about you, you have had time to leave enough traces about you e.g. online, in relationships etc so when they ask around about you, people confirm you're legit and not some scammer. \n\nSo far my strategy has been to do outreach through keynotes that are recorded, one to one interaction, videos etc. Now it's time to look at the product (what we're selling) and how to speed up the sales cycle.\n\nFor the product i've put together this table as a first rough sketch to have something to discuss pricing, packaging, communication etc:\n\n<table width=\"800\" border=\"1\">\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">\u00a0</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Basic</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Extensive</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Customised</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Tailor made</th>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\"><div align=\"left\">\n\n<strong>Pricing: </strong>One off / Subscription</div></th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\"><div align=\"left\">Training &amp; upskilling</div></th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">Communication and collaboration skills </th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">Writing for online engagement</th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">Reading and making sense of online data</th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">Building thriving policy-oriented communities online</th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">Social media training</th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">workshops and master classes</th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\"><div align=\"left\">Services</div></th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\"><div align=\"center\">Customised Action Research Tracks at events</div></th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">Networking assistance</th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">Research, articles, reports and books</th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">Consulting hours</th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">Proactive alerts</th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\"><div align=\"left\">Tools &amp; technologies</div></th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">in situ network analysis software</th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\"> in situ ethnographic analysis software</th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">social software</th>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n\nNow for speeding up the sales cycle. \n\n1. How do we find the right prospects? How do we get better and more efficient at this over time? We need to start with a list of names of people and organisations, find out what their problems and needs are and identify the ones with a high likelihood of matching what we have to offer. But I can't do this alone, I've composed a list but could use help going through it! Also not sure how to import a list here onto the wiki?\n\n2. We need to reach out to the prospective clients before they're in buying mode. Find our how they prefer to communicate, get in touch and try to get into a meeting or call. Find out what their problems and needs are: listen 80% and talk 20%. telling them about Edgeryders. Find out more about them. Ask hard questions to eliminate non-prospects as early as possible. If you get a no, gently find out why. If not, follow up with an email or handwritten note reminding them of what was said, and what you both agreed would be the next step (for you &amp; for the prospective client). \n\n3. If they ask for a formal proposal, don't email it over...ask them to set a time for a meeting during which you review it together. Here I think we can use the LOTE tracks and session proposals much more effectively.\n\n4. Give them time to make a decision. Contact them creatively.\n\nHow do we package what we have to offer, in was that people recognise it's value and are willing to move money out of their wallets to have? In the Long run we kind of sort of know, it's the short term I am more interested in. Well because the long run is a lot of short runs in sequence. Here I think the crowdfunding model makes sense, as in we build a campaign, put together the material etc as we would a crowdfunding campaign, but run it off the Edgeryders site and not one of the crowdfunding platforms. \n\nIm up for looking at this now I have had time to think a bit.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\nwindow.onload=function(){\n\nvar tfrow = document.getElementById('tfhover').rows.length;\n\nvar tbRow=[];\n\nfor (var i=1;i<tfrow;i++) {\n\ntbRow[i]=document.getElementById('tfhover').rows[i];\n\ntbRow[i].onmouseover = function(){\n\nthis.style.backgroundColor = '#ffffff';\n\n};\n\ntbRow[i].onmouseout = function() {\n\nthis.style.backgroundColor = '#bedda7';\n\n};\n\n}\n\n};\n\n</script>\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n\ntable.tftable {font-size:12px;color:#333333;width:100%;border-width: 1px;border-color: \\#9dcc7a;border-collapse: collapse;}\n\ntable.tftable th {font-size:12px;background-color:#abd28e;border-width: 1px;padding: 8px;border-style: solid;border-color: \\#9dcc7a;text-align:left;}\n\ntable.tftable tr {background-color:#bedda7;}\n\ntable.tftable td {font-size:12px;border-width: 1px;padding: 8px;border-style: solid;border-color: \\#9dcc7a;}\n\n</style>", "created_at": "2013-09-05 23:12:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:32.251930", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1192, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27094], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6505, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 2129, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Thank you &lt;3</b>\n\nBig Thank you to All :) &lt;3\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-07 15:12:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:38.156608", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1774, "user_id": 86, "topic_id": 1741, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I would like to take some moments to try to summarize the briefliest possible what is SPIRAL methodology, developed by the Council of Europe since 2005.\n\n<h2>Some context :</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>In a world which is becoming slightly <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIWTc0EtFu4\">smaller</a>, and with less resources and less availability of those, increasing the wealth of the richest does not anymore mean to increase also the wealth of the poorest.

Here she explains how:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/C5vNh7x800Y?rel=0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"http://flavors.me/annewizorek\">Anne</a> is a freelance consultant for social media, online strategy/project manager for mainly online projects. Her studies have nothing to do with any of that, she dropped out of university, although getting the diploma is still very important in Germany. Anne was always working, even when studying and realised that to finish her studies she would have to stop working, which would mean a student loan - something she didn't want to do. She wanted to do something real, get something done and a degree in German literature wasn't about that.\n\nShe became an online editor for one of the most popular German blogs and as part of that job became a curator/co-organiser at one of the most important social media conferences in Germany, <a href=\"http://re-publica.de/11/\">Re:publica</a>. She really enjoyed that job and it enabled her to explore what had started out as a hobby, a passion - blogging, using social media networks, and eventually she did an art project called <a href=\"http://papergirl-berlin.de/\">PaperGirl Berlin</a> - doing the event management as well as the blog and online communication. Anne had always done this stuff because she loved it but figured out, \"OK, this is something that not everyone can do, it's a very special way of communicating and not everyone can do it, although the tools are really accessible,\" so decided to make a profession of it.\n\nAfter those gigs finished she was working as a freelancer but was still craving the security of being employed. She was lucky because at that time she learnt a lot about communication and PR through being part of the team that organised <a href=\"http://slutwalkberlin.de/\">SlutWalk</a> in Berlin, doing the online communications and a lot of public relations which helped her a lot although she didn't get any money for it - but gained experience which was much more valuable, even in terms of self confidence. After SlutWalk she got a job at an agency but realised it wasn't how she wanted to bring her skills to people or help clients. She quit and luckily just after that was offered a big contact as a freelancer, a project she is currently working on.\n\nRight now she is trying to decide if she wants to found her own company, apply for funding, look for any agency which is closer to what she wants to do or maybe team up with friends who have great skills. Anne was surprised to find out that there are people who need the things she was enjoying doing as a hobby. She doesn't feel there is a way to educate people to do what she is doing so she realised she had a skill with which to help people.\n\nPersonal networking has become very essential in getting jobs, and being recommended by people has been important too. She couldn't make a living without both online and offline networking. She has found that networks are distinct in different places - she has just returned from New York where, as a feminist activist, she met many of the people whose books and blogs she reads and she had the feeling that the community there is closer and more supportive than in Germany. This made her think that she could change the situation as she thinks there are probably more people here who feel the same way. She wants to initiate an event and forge a community to get this kind of environment going in Berlin as well.\n\n<strong>Taking to the streets</strong>\n\nI asked her to tell me more about SlutWalk. It started in Toronto, Canada because at a security training session on the campus a police officer said women would be less likely to be raped if they didn't dress like sluts. Students were so appalled that they initiated the SlutWalk - they wanted to provoke with the name but wanted to make visible that they are the victims and that society should, finally, be blaming the perpetrators. The event spread all over the world, to around 80 cities. It was a huge topic in blogs and finally Anne realised it was something that was missing: people spend a lot of time talking about things that are problematic but never take action, never take it to the streets. She did some research and found a few people in Berlin who wanted to start it, so she got in touch with them and a few weeks later was in complete SlutWalk mode. She says it was very intense but she learned a lot, also about herself and it was really great experience to do.\n\nThe Internet means that anyone, anywhere will always be able to find some sort of information about these issues and in the best case can make you more comfortable with whatever problem you have - you see there are other people who feel the same way. Before you feel completely alone and it is now easier to get in touch with people and give each other support. For her this development is one of the most important things that has evolved during her time online.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Generational clash</strong>\n\nShe feels that most of the policy makers and institutions are really far away from understanding the experience of people who have grown up with the Internet as a normal part of their lives. She sees a generational clash around some things like privacy - warnings about not sharing too much information although she feels sharing can be very valuable, even if it's painful, because then you can reach out to people who feel the same way. \"We have to make sure, especially with all this paranoia going on in the newspapers and the media that by sharing information you are doomed, you'll never get a job\u2026..actually this is more about making visible what makes us human,\" she says. It's labeled as being a failure, she continues, so we need to make sure that people are not curating their online personas so much that only the positive things are shown. Anne gives the example of people whose Facebook timeline makes you think they must be really happy but when you talk to them you discover they're having a bad time, even though they are posting about happy moments.\n\nShe still finds it incredible that she can just get in touch with people all over the world and have both global and local networks and points out the importance of \"this way of bonding and empowering people is eventually always the reason for change\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-01 09:49:50", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 22:39:33.009224", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1261, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14237, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 782, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Heroes passing through</b>\n\nWelcome from me, too @Alan_Murray !

Namely, we would be asking new users to do something that no one does anymore. So we are shifting the burden onto new prospective members to care enough to fill out a form. While this burdening may be appropriate for those applying to the university or a job,\u00a0it seems like EdgeRyders might miss out on the opportunity to attract lots of users who would simply be \"weak users\" initially. I.e. they will only start out as passive readers. However weak users can turn into strong users over time,\u00a0when the moment\u00a0is right for them. This transformational phenomenon is\u00a0something that has been\u00a0referred to as the \"reader-to-leader framework\" (<a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/papers/Jennifer2009Reader.pdf\">http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/papers/Jennifer2009Reader.pdf</a>). I originally wanted to post this comment within a dev group, but I didn't have default permissions to do that, so right now, I still see a website that may be inadvertently biased towards users who are pre-commited, to whom EdgeRyders means a whole lot.\u00a0\n\nI began to think about this as I was asked to start brainstorming ideas on the marketing side of things. The more porous EdgeRyders is as a platform, the easier it would be for me to suck in outsiders who could potentially transform into much more active members over time. oAuth is one such solution, even if it isn't trendy given the privacy scandals of recent day.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt also need not be the only solution. But I have been meaning to share this observation for quite some time, as I observe my own state of mind online. I find myself always wanting to keep my EdgeRyders communications on Facebook as much as possible, unless absolutely necessary (don't ask me why -- it's a lizard brain thing). So now you will find me on the site itself much more frequently because the timing is right for me and I am ready to be more committed as I have recently made some decisions to work more closely on \\#Lote, etc.\u00a0\n\nI don't have access to backend analytics but my guess is that EdgeRyders could benefit from a strategy that make it easy and frictionless for newbies to dip their toes into the sometimes frigid waters of online collaboration.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-17 19:52:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.604310", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted":

fertilit\u00e0 della terra.\n\n\u00a0Usa coltivare in ambienti spontanei dove il clima e regolato dalla presenza di alberi,\u00a0le varie inpollinazioni si innescano in ambienti favorevoli perch\u00e8 sono\u00a0naturali.\n\nL'uomo giovane\u00a0che vive la permacultura non sofre di presunzione nei confronti della natura,\u00a0impara ad ascoltarla, coltiva la terra per le esigenze della famiglia, se produce in pi\u00f9 lo scambia al interno della\u00a0piccola comunita\u00a0\u00a0creando la stabilit\u00e0 reale.\n\nPer questo motivo indico come esempio le vechie piccole comunit\u00e0 che necessitano di nuova vitalit\u00e0 giovanile, serve che i giovani uniscano le forze\u00a0, aiutando e imparando dai vecchi contadini.\n\nI vecchi contadini di montagna\u00a0conoscono il valore della produzione stagionale, questo tipo di produzione li metteva nelle condizioni pi\u00f9 favorevoli e durature, non cercano mai di sfidare l'ecosistema, vivono in simbiosi con esso.\n\nTral altro alimentarsi con cibo stagionale, cresciuto naturalmente, accrescie le nostre capacit\u00e0 immunologiche, permettendo l'assimilazione completa dei vari sistemi innescati, il nostro sistema deve avere il tempo giusto per riconoscere tutti i fattori che lo rendono vivo nel ambiente naturale.\n\nSorge spontaneo\u00a0 chedersi perch\u00e8 questa cultura presente in tutta Europa non e stata mai valorizzata per le reali potenzialit\u00e0 che apporta, rispondo\u00a0 : il profitto e il tarlo che mangia le menti, apre nuovi spazzi incolmabili, approfittare della terra significa aprofittare di\u00a0 se stessi, come la terra si sterilizza anche l'uomo la segue ha ruota.\n\nIn tutte le terre sterili e secche si puo portare nuova vit\u00e0, come: portando gli animali, e l'acqua, con questi due esseri viventi l'uomo puo aiutare la biosfera ha crescere.\n\nL'uomo e legato agli animali e con essi, vivendo ritmi ciclici cosparge germinazione su tutta la terra affidatagli.\n\nQuesta democrazia (acqua e animali) permette alle piccole comunit\u00e0 la sopravvivenza.\n\nPensate ha quanti animali vengono uccisi per essere mangiati da individui che neanche immaginano quanto bene potrebbero creare da vivi.\n\nQuanto e grande la biosfera?\n\nQuante piccole comunit\u00e0 esistono sul continente europeo?\n\nTagliando le spese per il fabbisogno alimentare, si avranno pi\u00f9 soldi per gli scambi culturali fra le giovani comunit\u00e0.\n\nSi possono fare esperimenti fra i giovani che partecipano ha programmi come Leonardo da Vinci, lo studio della storia dei popoli europei legato alla cultura materiale di piccole comunit\u00e0.\n\nIn ogni nazione le propie piccole comunit\u00e0 articolate sopra tutta la biosfera del continente europeo, questo per cominciare la nuova era di sviluppo di conoscenze legate al nostro ecosistema terrestre.\n\nDoveroso ringrazziare Alberto per avermi dato la possibilit\u00e0 di trasmettere valori comuni\n\nGrazie!\n\nSimone Muffolini\n\n",

Great to see last year's initiative is taken a step further! Georgia's been doing great on the projects part, and people are still eager to come to the meet-ups I organize, not always a lot of people, but always people with great ideas to share.\u00a0\n\nI am writing this right now from my kitchen table with a 4 day old baby next to me! We got home from the hospital yesterday :)). Little Leonard will join the futurespotters community right away!\n\nSo what's been happening in Georgie? Well, to start with, I am slightly biased as I got a part time advisor position at Iare Pekhit (the pedestrian rights organization) to help them set up a membership based association (funded by undef). So what's happening on the pedestrian rights front I now know all about ;). Actually, today there's an event where the winner of a public art contest will be revealed. Unfortunately I will not be able to join, but I'll make sure to post some pics to the Georgia group later on.\u00a0\n\nFor a few months different public space related grass roots organizations joined efforts in order to stop the building of a shopping mall and cable cart in old town under the name ERTAD (together). Several meet ups and one large protest march were organized. Unfortunately the group fell apart due to some miscommunications amongst the members, but for as long as it lived it showed great progress. I guess in the future with other large projects which may harm the urban space, this will be able to be set up again.\u00a0\n\nThe last few months an artist duo has been tagging the city with phrases which should make people think about the space they live in. It's an art and social development project by Mariam Natroshvili and co. It's really cool to be in the suburbs somewhere and see a prhase and know it's them. The other day I was hiking (when I still could ;) ) in the hills behind our flat and found a text stenciled on an abandoned trailer in the middle of nowhere. It's very powerful. It would be great to find out more about the project and the artists' goals.\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c8a9c207db3d2c36695dc21017d724224db10f09.jpg\" width=\"669\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nWhat else? Oh yes, in fall several people came together (elva, undp, remi from cospot, me, charlotte from new ngo chaikhana, eric from jumpstart) to brainstorm about setting up a social innovation hub. We held several different meetings about how and what and were offered a place in the national scientific library. By January we were convinced we would somehow be able to make this happen, when the director of the library told us he had gotten a large sum of the government to renovate the place themselves, we would not be able to use the space permanently as a result. Although this was disappointing, UNDP offered the library to help them set up a workshop to see what users would like the library to be (co-creating). The Social Innovation Hub has been a bit quiet since, but that's ok. In the mean time we have learned of several other different hubs being set up: one at a university, and one by a local youth NGO with the support of businesses. There may even be more, but I cant tell you from the top of my head ;).\u00a0\n\nThere are many more interesting developments, such as the creation of the NGO chaikhana, which supports journalists; several different small social start-ups have seen the light; and probably many many more.\n\nSo, why this summary of how Georgia is doing? Well, as many of you know I was Georgia's community builder last year for the Spot the Future project. I loved doing the work (it doesnt even feel like work!). And, I would love to take on the role again. I have time as well, as I ditched some projects pre-birth that I didnt like, to have more positiveness in my life. And, as I already know from last year how it works (I do know there are several different changes, but nothing to major as I understand), I will be able to work efficiently! :))\n\nNow, this is a quick post from my kitchen table, still a bit sore from giving birth, but I could not NOT reply ;). Anyway, shoot if you have any follow up questions. I'll be following the group closely and see what's happening.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-10 11:12:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:46.059047", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 795, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2010, 3, 2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20312, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4484, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Marked done.</b>\n\n.", "created_at": "2015-11-04 12:58:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:53.135584", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30636, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 5102, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>News from Calais</b>\n\nThoughts?\u00a0http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=8ac_1455236332#OheXyhVV2Z7uKv3T.01\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-12 09:03:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:48.621658", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24524, "user_id": 2, "topic_id": 3214, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>closed...</b>\n\n... as it didn't go anywhere\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-02 09:04:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:15.876714", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5409, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5376, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>Imported back from the hackpad:\u00a0https://lote5.hackpad.com/FRI-1000-Collaborative-inclusion.-2THjEEYA7Iy.

A reflexive design exercise.\n\nLOTE5 session: https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare/let-s-co-create-our-own-welfare-how-to-design-collaborative\n\nPlease read the<strong> Notes for participants</strong> prepared by Ezio and the team: http://bit.ly/1PMWB0V\n\nThis pad text is synchronized as you type, so that everyone viewing this page sees the same text. \u00a0This allows you to collaborate seamlessly on documents!\n\nEzio: \"Before you try to invent something new, look very attentively for existing solutions in society. Even as you find them, that does not mean you cannot help: these inventions will typically exist, but they will need help, they will be perfectible.\n\nToday we are going to do just this:\u00a0\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>We take an issue \u2013 migration and the influx of refugees</li>\n\n<li>We look around at what people are already doing in order to ameliorate the problem.</li>\n\n<li>We audit those services from a design point of view and we look at spaces for improvements.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWhat makes a service \"good\"? In the area of design for social innovation we consider services \"good\" if:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>They run on the active participation of beneficiaries.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>They make use of the situated knowledge of everybody involved.</li>\n\n<li>They create value for the society at large.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWe look at two main value creation strategies:\u00a0\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Improving the case.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Enriching the case's ecosystem \u2013 imagine things around the project that give it positive externalities.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWe are really not qualified to improve the case of services designed and implemented by others. They know so much more than we do about those projects and how they really work. \u00a0Looking to enrich the ecosystem is much simpler. The main question is: <strong>what can I, with my peers, do to improve this?</strong>\n\nThese services are targeted at inclusion. Why is it <em>collaborative</em> inclusion? Say we we repair a bicycle, and we do it together: when we have done it, we will not \"simply\" have a working bicycle: we will have a social relationship that can be repurposed to do things other than repairing that particular bicycle. Collaboration is an engine to build social capital, and social capital then produces a flow of new things. But collaboration is tricky: it requires an explicit social contract (what are you promising?) and commitment. Collaboration is also interlinked with the issue of diversity: having diversity is good, because it enhances the resilience of the system, but it also increases the costs of \u00a0collaboration.\u00a0\n\nYara Al Adib describes the process of arriving in Belgium as a refugee. A visual synthesis is here: https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/how-refugees-are-processed-in-belgium. It's pretty heartbreaking: hurry and wait; disempowering sense that there is this impersonal machine dragging you on. Some of the people in Belgium were very empathetic, but you do meet with a lot of stereotypes.\n\nThe journey is interesting. You meet a lot of people, you learn things. It is also quite challenging, it puts in situations where you have to be brave.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">The cases</h3>\n\n<strong>Elizabeth from DineWithUs</strong> (http://dinewithus.strikingly.com/). \"Once a migrant has been processed and is \"legalised\" in Belgium there remains a wall between Belgians and newcomers. I was personally frustrated that I did not know any of them, and all my friends were white. Our idea is pretty simple, just share a meal, learn recipes and teach your own. We have now over 100 registrations, it's working OK but we need to grow.\"\n\n<strong>Sara from StudioRefugee</strong> (http://www.studiorefugee.be/). \u00a0\"We match (graphic) designers (and design-students) with refugees to design products that contain real refugee-stories, then sell the products.\"\n\n<strong>Tarik from SmartSocial</strong> (http://www.smartsocial.be/). \"I have a hospitality startup. What with refugee crisis, we asked ourselves whether we could use that expertise and team towards social housing. So we started a first project serving minors in the European contract. We have a very good relationship with FedAsil Our first obstacle: the owner of the building is not so happy that minor refugees will move into his building. So we tried to convert some of future co-working spaces from our other startup into temporary accommodation for refugees. But we were sued by our neighbours. But we won: we have legal expertise and took the case very seriously. This is a crazy venture, but it is important to address the crisis. I am grateful to my business partners who accepted that I dedicate half of my time to SmartSocial. As entrepreneurs, we know camps are not enough, and should get involved when we see the opportunity.\"\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">The design tools (Vishall and Stefanos from Namahn)</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Stakeholder map</strong>. Who are the protagonists of this story? Which groups are affected, or interested? Migrants, for sure, but certainly other people too.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Persona</strong>. \"Placeholder\" imaginary persons that we can imagine interacting with our cases.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Journey of Experience</strong>. A conceptualization of how people interact with services over time. It forces us to think in terms of time.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Plenary restitution</h3>\n\nIn the <strong>StudioRefugee</strong> case, the area of improvement is how you create value for both refugees and the Belgian host community. The concept is that in addition to turning the venture into a cooperative with shared ownership from refugees, some of the refugees who get involved can become ambassadors for the StudioRefugee. They envision to expand from Ghent to Antwerp, putting one of the refugee-designers in charge. Rand suggestions enabling makers of artefacts, refugees themselves, to sell their own products e.g in Brussels Vintage Market.\n\nSome of the more detailed discussions:\u00a0\n\nSelling products is a highly competitive market - &gt; Need to offer customer value proposition\n\nAlso, where do you start? \u00a0This depends on intent: Is it training people to build skills? \u00a0Is it nurturing exceptional talents? or generating an income stream?\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>If you start with the people: Find means to be able to train people to develop skills (information, education, financial support)</li>\n\n<li>If you start with the talent: Find people with unique skills, incubate them</li>\n\n<li>If you start with customer: Find distribution channel, map demand</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThere is a discussion about this where some people in the group assert that the venture has to generate an income for the refugees, and not just training- training for what? Founder's answer: Making people happy!\n\nThe <strong>DineWithUs</strong> group has recommended to advertise the service already from within the refugee camps, using the camps themselves as a communication device. Now people who register from small communities tend to have no match, so they sit idly. We have imagined we could instead ask first registrants from one community to become volunteers, putting themselves out as the reference point of DWU in their local community. Additionally:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Public feedback: \"we really had fun at our dinner...\"</li>\n\n<li>Collaboration with chefs.</li>\n\n<li>Photographs of participants on the website (it fosters trust)\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\"... many more, there is not the time to list them all!\"</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n[Missed the <strong>SmartSocial</strong> restitution, please add].\u00a0\n\n\"Until you know the people you are nothing. The sooner you can attach refugees to a social network, the better.\"\n\nIs it better to have a generalist service that also refugees can use or should we have specialised, \"exclusive\" services? The refugees in the room (particularly Rand and Orwa) could not really decide one way or the other. They do not like labels, but they do appreciate how difficult it can be for refugees to use generalist services. Ezio: you should have both. Specialised services should \"break the ice\", but then generalist ones should be welcoming towards refugees.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-03 18:11:18", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:31.864169", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1430, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10616, "user_id": 2, "topic_id": 2204, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Joining....</b>\n\nHi...I will be there for the Saturday....doubt that I will be allowed do the Sunday as well....\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-21 20:11:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:00.942246", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 24, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12623, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4863, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>YesSS!</b>\n\nhihihi\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-22 12:05:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:11.825690", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11832], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17006, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 619, "post_number": 9, "raw": "I wish i could have come to that party!

As any city taking its candidacy seriously, the Matera 2019 team had started to work ever since 2008 and during the race it came to surpass twenty other Italian cities. \n\nHaving worked with Matera 2019 over the last years as part of the Edgeryders global network, helping implement the [unMonastery](http://unmonastery.org) pilot and running two [Living on the Edge](/en/welcome-to-lote4) international events on site, I have witnessed great work. Luckily, I was able to peek inside as well, beyond what the PR of any such candidacy campaign would allow. And I'm glad I had the chance, now that this phase of Matera's journey is over, to sit down for lengthier conversations with @rossellatarantino, @NicoBis, @RitaO and others. There's some things I picked up as major strong points of their competitiveness:\n\n## The ECOC title is awarded for a vision of the future that is actually convincing.\n\nMatera is one of Europe's oldest settlements (the Sassi caves date back to 9000 years and some are still inhabitable!) and has spectacular aesthetics. But this is far from winning you the lottery, as the experience of cities comparable in beauty, some even true tourism factories, shows (Venice and Pisa didn't make the shortlist). What's more, Matera faces serious challenges: high youth emigration rates, ageing population, historical conservatism and a tourism economy relaunched in mid nineties only, after decades of abandonment of the historical city. Culturally, Matera has been isolated over the last years, being predominantly a consumer of culture.\n\nWhat appears to have impressed the jury is the strength of the program, based on the idea of a profound democratization of local cultural production, parallel to revitalizing the heritage. The city looks willing to fully open itself towards Europe through radical innovation, which is not just a promise but is based on having been socialized during the last years through pilot projects and real partnerships (ex [Living on the Edge](/en/welcome-to-lote4), [unMonastery](http://unmonastery.org/), [Coderdojo](http://www.coderdojomatera.it/) ). At the same time, Matera is \"smart\" enough to acknowledge the role of technology in approaching cultural future(s). Over the past years it became an open data leader in Southern Italy and through ECOC is committing to digitalize all cultural archives, releasing them under creative commons licenses, therefore moving ahead as a cultural platform for Europe's whole South. The fact that these are mostly driven by grassroots citizenship really makes one believe in its proposal for a horizontal, true participatory culture.\n\nThe Open Future slogan is inspired from the open source philosophy, and Rossella explains how<em> everyone could participate in the cultural process, and this could be also a new challenge for most cities, because they can produce cultures and not only buy cultures from the big cities, and in some forms I think that this culture was applied in our process \u2013 a lot of citizens took part in it.</em>\n\n## The citizens' support is not a default, nor is it unconditional. They want to be involved.\n\nWith 50 permanent volunteers, a web community with hundreds of active participants, and hundreds other partners and collaborators, Matera signaled it is pursuing a collective transformation, not just at city level - it was supported by the entire Basilicata region, including the other major province, Potenza. So you have city of 60000 representing in fact 600 000. I found it illustrative and meaningful how many people built a [cultural caravan](http://www.ilrestoquotidiano.it/articolo/10326/La-Basilicata-Rurale-che-ha-camminato-per-Matera2019.aspx) and walked, biked, even horse rode 150 kilometres in a week to show solidarity and support for the city.\n\n<em>I think it was really democratic because we didn\u2019t work with the big players who have a sort of culture monopoly, but we worked with citizens, and all the people who like to have a stance, to have something to give and also to take. We had a very strong institutional support, but at the same time we had a lot of freedom in the management, in the strategy, in drafting the cultural program, and I think that this keeps a lot of trust in the future, also trust in each other; also a new change in the South, because South is afflicted by skepticism that nothing can be done because there is no clear identification of people who are able: there is always some bribe, and now we give all the people a possibility to propose and to implement these ideas. This was a strong message (Rossella Tarantino, program manager).</em>\n\nNico said something similar: <em>I think the Jury felt this candidate city like a dream of a southern Italian region that needs to dream, and to run. </em>\n\n## You can't implement the program, and therefore can't win without a strong commitment from your governments.\n\nI was very surprised to learn that the financial prize the European Commission awards to the winning city is way much lower than the program budget. To give you an idea, Matera will get 1.5 million euros from EU, while the amount pledged by the local city council and regional council is 30 million. And that pledge, according to Rossella, won them a great deal of credibility:<span> </span><em>There was a good delivery mechanism; our visionary program was built on solid foundations \u2013 money and good governance. We worked closely with the regional administration and they didn\u2019t just put in money for some events, they studied with us and tried to see which is the financial feasibility of the projects; we defined a binding financial agreement which puts aside 30 million euros, so the program is partly already funded and we worked closely for these objectives also because this was our plan B. This is a very fierce competition and only one [city] could win; so we have to take the responsibility to give people something even if we don\u2019t win. We gave them the certainty that this program could be realized whatever the result was.</em>\n\nThe Matera people indeed seemed convinced, as thousands gathered in a local square the evening that the EU announced the decision, for a party called \"What happens, happens\" (<em>Comunque Vada </em>in Italian). And it sure happened:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/RYl3kTkO8Mk\n\n<em>Thank you Rossella, Nico and everyone in the Matera 2019 team who cared to talk to me about this.This post was initially written for a Romanian audience, in Romanian, in the context of various cities running for ECOC 2021.

Dup\u0103 multe conversa\u021bii personale, cel pu\u021bin trei lucruri, cred eu, au fost esen\u021biale \u00een competi\u021bie.\n\n[b]Se premiaz\u0103 o viziune conving\u0103toare asupra viitorului ora\u0219[/b]\n\nMatera e unul din cele mai vechi a\u0219ez\u0103minte europene (pe\u0219terile calcaroase din ora\u0219ul vechi dateaz\u0103 de acum 9000 ani \u0219i unele sunt \u00eenc\u0103 locuibile!) \u0219i are o estetic\u0103 spectaculoas\u0103. \u00cens\u0103 nu te calific\u0103 nimeni pe \u201eochi frumo\u0219i\u201d, cum s-ar zice, dovad\u0103 fiind faptul c\u0103 ora\u0219e cu date similare \u0219i chiar adev\u0103rate fabrici de turism (Vene\u021bia, Pisa) nu au intrat nici m\u0103car pe lista scurt\u0103.

Cultural, Matera a fost izolat\u0103 \u00een ultimii ani, fiind un ora\u0219 de provincie predominant consumator.\n\nCeea ce pare s\u0103 fi convins juriul a fost ideea de profund\u0103 democratizare a produc\u021biei culturale, \u00een paralel cu revitalizarea patrimoniului. Matera e dispus\u0103 s\u0103 se deschid\u0103 fundamental spre Europa prin inova\u021bie radical\u0103, cu care s-a socializat deja prin proiecte pilot \u0219i parteneriate reale (ex  [Living on the Edge](), [unMonastery](http://unmonastery.org), [Coderdojo]() ). Totodat\u0103 e destul de \u201csmart\u201d ca s\u0103 recunoasc\u0103 rolul tehnologiei \u00een abordarea culturii. \u00cen ultimii ani, Matera a devenit lider \u00een Sudul Italiei pe zona de date deschise (open data) \u0219i va transfera toate arhivele culturale \u00een spa\u021biul digital, cu licen\u021be libere cu tot, pentru a deveni principala platforma cultural\u0103 din sudul Europei. Faptul c\u0103 ini\u021biativele sunt revendicate \u00een totalitate de cet\u0103\u021beni e primul exemplu de cultur\u0103 participativ\u0103 \u0219i orizontal\u0103 care st\u0103 la baza dosarului. \n\nSloganul Open Future se inspir\u0103 din filozofia open source, iar Rossella Tarantino, manager de programe, spune despre el c\u0103<em>implic\u0103 cunoa\u0219terea \u00eemp\u0103rt\u0103\u0219it\u0103, astfel \u00eenc\u00e2t toat\u0103 lumea particip\u0103 \u00een procesul cultural.

( In the meantime many of you have keenly followed us on Twitter and the EdgeRyders\u2019 platform for at least fleeting glances of our work. )\n\n** unMonastery Matera -- il Prototipo\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first ever ever prototype of the unMonastery tradition landed in the City of Matera in Southern Italy, earlier last month. It was a suitably tough start, but things are definitively underway. Today we can even invite you to visit us virtually on the newly launched unMonastery beautifully bilingual website:\n\n**<span>\n\nwww.unMonastery.org</span>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a top priority the website is heavily focused on communicating with the citizenry of Matera but has many new features, including Projects, People, News, Events and perhaps most helpfully an FAQ, which we hope will go some way to explaining exactly what it is that we are doing here.\n\nIn the coming weeks we will launch a global version of the site, which will give an overview of the conceptual framework that we are developing and how the unMonastery idea might be successfully applied to other localities.\n\n** Our Inaugural Opening Ceremony\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you happen to find yourself in Southern Italy in the next week perhaps consider a pilgrimage to our Opening Ceremony in Matera on Saturday the 15th of March. After just six weeks in the field we are opening our doors for a series of workshops, presentations from unMonaserians and local projects of Matera, we\u2019ll also host the first Open Street Mapping session in the morning and other initiatives we will be embarking on during our time as inhabitants of our inspiring walls.\n\nWe hope that this day will present the first of many opportunities to develop our core project, which is focused on activating an open dialogue with the communities present here.\n\n** Final Days of CheFare\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarlier in the year, we were surprised to find ourselves in the running for the CheFare award, which offers \u20ac100,000 to grassroots, P2P projects such as ours. The frustrating element is that it involves a voting system, despite this we used our time and energy to start work on a Sustainability Plan, to counter the request of a Business Plan, you can read more on the website.\n\nIn order to implement that plan and ensure the longevity of the unMonastery in Matera, we need votes. It would be deeply appreciated if you can take the time to vote for us on the CheFare website - and share the link online.   Voting ends Thursday. If you can bluff Italian via google translate : one may bump us up the sweepstakes -- to what we imagine is at least a years additional funding from: vote here (<a href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=destination_language&amp;u=http://www.che-fare.com/progetti-approvati/unmonastery/\">http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=destination_language&amp;u=http://www.che-fare.com/progetti-approvati/unmonastery/</a>)\n\n** Support our work\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you'd like to materially support the unMonastery in it\u2019s work please head over to our Wishlist page (<a href=\"http://matera.unmonastery.org/en/pages/wishlist\">http://matera.unmonastery.org/en/pages/wishlist</a>) and share what you can.

Judging from the other semi-final ideas, I guess I will meet a lot of Edgeryders type folks :)\n\nAs for details on how to proceed, I'm sorry that I seriously lack time at the moment to get my thoughts wrapped up ... but I'll try to create a post soon, yes. The app's concept itself has matured in the meantime already (see the <a href=\"http://socialinnovationcompetition.eu/399/\">Economy App profile page</a> at the SIC2013 website for the latest version), so from the tech side it looks well. What I definitely need help with is contacts, to establish collaborations that would go into the re-application (which is due 2013-04-12). This probably means:\n\n(1) A pilot community of beta testers, interested to deploy and co-develop the first version of the app. Maybe the unMonastery folks if it fits into what Matera needs ...\n\n(2) The right kind of social innovation institution which agrees to help the project along with their experience. Can also be a collaboration with university researchers or something.\n\nAlso I'm a bit at a loss when it comes to PR etc. for spreading this app beyond the borders of the pilot community ....\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-01 23:36:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:07.867930", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 249, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9685], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20035, "user_id": 87, "topic_id": 1296, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Fantastic!\n\nJohn\n\nFounder and</b>\n\nFantastic!\n\n<address>John</address><address>Founder and CEO</address><address><a href=\"http://govinthelab.com\">Government in the Lab</a></address>", "created_at": "2012-01-28 03:29:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:51.563218", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 29, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6067, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6034, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello all,\u00a0\n\nWe have a basic text and language we can work with, and a featured challenge:\u00a0https://edgeryders.eu/en/policies-of-care\n\nI think in order to collect contributions of value and engage the community in a real conversation we need to be smart and creative about this.\n\nI propose to run a real engagement campaign in January and prepare it well in the remaining of this year.\n\nI started a planning document that I want to run by you and ask that we fill in content and potential gaps.

The first item will lead you to the view previously introduced by Guy <a href=\"/t/dashboard-down/5999/4\">here</a>. We propose three permanent modules to visualise and filter the data\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The timeline is present for filtering purpose. Just hold-click, drag and release to select a period to use as a filter. Press the reset button to clear out the time filter.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/886b4c8400111c2aceedf688ea68e835b5675e54.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"291\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dfce635b2e7069844701a6fe83fc0435be69cb25.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"286\">\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The node-link module shows a graph of the tag-tag relations. By default, you will start with a simple radial representation of the relations between a focused tag and the others linked to it, which looks like this:</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/623a51b78edb72badf197c8ae5b058c61a48a11c.png\" width=\"502\" height=\"500\">\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>By checking the option \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4d3c39e5577efd0f7248152d50b544145650c227.png\" width=\"411\" height=\"25\">\n\nat the top, you can end up with the complete tag-to-tag relation graph still focused on a single tag (now coloured in blue to ease its identification).

The Tag View Full is much simpler and aims at simply exploring the tag-to-tag relations and filter them based on their strength (number of co-occurence). This exploratory need was discussed during the <a href=\"/t/masters-of-networks-ethnography/5975\">Master of Network session</a> in Milan (2016/11/27) and the underlying principles have been developed by Alberto in a <a href=\"/t/making-sense-of-a-large-conversation-with-the-reduced-co-occurrences-graph/5997\">previous post</a>.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bc9361e327391a97c18dc9d4df2aed21e0835c0b.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"330\">\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>This view only shows a single permanent panel to visualise the node-link representation of the tag-to-tag relations.</li>\n\n<li>The sole filtering tool for now allows to choose the minimum number of co-occurences an edge and a tag must possess to be displayed; the default value is set to 2 and can go up to 8.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c105e5d65e35b4333e19b8a4989aa8ca8133ce81.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"329\">\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>We reuse two of the interactors introduced earlier to <strong>navigate the graph</strong> and <strong>show details. </strong>The pop-up mechanism displaying information when clicking on a node is similar to the other view and the list of comments and posts showing when clicking on an edge is added this time beneath the main module (press \"Clear to discard it).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/360b28c78ad5410d53511397106c73ac31e6d212.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"382\">\n\nThis is it for now, more will come later to take a look at the dynamics of innovation. As I have said at the begining, if you have any ideas of tasks, or ethnographic question in mind, we may be able to make up something easily or improve what is already there, so share your thoughts!\n\nCheers!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-13 00:36:33", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 07:52:34.569389", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1424, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3074], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4674, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4641, "post_number": 1, "raw": "So @Nadia came up with this cool idea to interview each other in order to practice writing the case studies and I decided to interview @Driss (he\u2019s going to interview me too) as he is the Engagement Manager for Morocco and as I am very much interested in having Moroccans on the platform ( I have been actively involved in helping @Alberto prepare for his mission in Casablanca/Rabat by finding key people to meet with + someone who would qualify as an Engagement Manager) I decided to do this exercise with Driss to get to know him better.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9ce97470e4e7ecd602fb567313f388a54dce23d7.jpg\" width=\"499\" height=\"499\"><br>\n\nDriss El Moudni is a young Moroccan entrepreneur who established an advertising agency <a href=\"https://www.nozidees.com/\">Nozidees </a>in Casablanca in 2013.

MARIAM AND DETU STILL NEED TO LOOK AT IT, SO I DID NOT CHANGE IT AROUND TO MAKE IT AN ACTUAL CASE STUDY YET.</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMainly we are working on text based art, which in public space, we are interested in art in public space and social engaged art and participatory art, which is quite not so new in Georgia, new in the case that some parts are happening. For example participatory art. But, for me they dont have a real impact. Well, I myself haven't worked much on it, it is more.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Batumi backyard stories, we have created the museum of superstition, collecting all the knowledge of the people living there and it was more ethnographical or anthropological kind of research and then to translate it to visual language and artistic language.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlso, we are continuing the ghosts museum project, we will continue it this summer in garikula we are collecting stories from the people in the area, from the villages, and also translating it to visual language. But is more informative, it should have an informative outcome. It is kind of subjective, it is knowledge and lifestyle of the people which is disappearing, the legends, and how does this influence the people living there.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe text based art, HTTP, that we are making is always in a an open space, most of the time it is without any permission, those text which are ready made texts we take from the media, internet. For example \u201cI feel lucky\u201d text is from google. We have made this text in an abandonned taxi garage on the nutsubidze plato, where now IDPs live from the 1990s. So, we're changing the contexts of these texts and putting them in another place which is\u2026 Those message are to wake up, Try to change visions of people. Also, there is always one problem, why ar those texts in english? And maybe that is right, maybe we should do it in Georgian.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe started this project homework, with just words, not ready made texts. The first one was in the popiashvili window project: \u201cghval\u201d \u201ctomorrow\u201d. And it was on Rustaveli avenue. It's actually the first time we also made the Georgian text. It was \u201cdghes an ghval\u201d \u201ctoday or tomorrow\u201d, and we also made it in batumi. It's the sentence you here every time. When you are asking, when is the project ready? Today or tomorrow. It is constant reality. It's never today. It is always today OR tomorrow. The second one was \u201ctime\u201d \u201cdro\u201d. Which we made on the rose revolution square in front of the radisson. The idea came from John fekner <a href=\"http://www.johnfekner.com/\">http://www.johnfekner.com/</a> work from the 80ies in new york. He used abandond billboard. Kind off hacking reality, using spaces which are not supposed to be for art. Use spaces where art is not supposed to be or has not been before. So we asked outdoor.ge, who is a billboard company, and we asked them to give one billboard for free every month and they gave it to us. And then we asked Irina Popiashvili to collaborate with us, but then we couldnt find funding to print . City hall has promised for 3 months already to give us the money, but they haven't transfer it, so the project stopped.. We did make two. The first one was 'dro' and the second one was by david kukhulashvili, he is also an artist, on deisi. Itwas on a pink background, four guys in suits with spacemen, kosmonaut fishbowls and the text was 'Georgian politicians'. When you are making urban art, or art in public spaces, it should be critical. Because for beautification of walls of spaces, that should not be the point.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen the 25 million project. I always seperate activism and art in a way, it is even not in my portfolio. BUT art can be a really good tool for activism. It was funny how much it blew up, the impact it had. It was a present for the patriarch, for his birthday. And we are thinking to continue these kind of projects in the future. For example in HTTP, the text based art projects I mentioned before, are not always clear, for one it can be political, for the other romantic, so it's not so obvious. We got a lot of messages, a lot of people were upset. It was unimaginable to them. But the conversation has to continue, it started, but I dont think it continued. The main thing of this texts was to question why do we have to in this poor country give so much money to the church, an institution which is distributing hatred? And then what should we do? Should we cancel it, or? Or, when should we cancel this agreement? Or what they did in Germany, where they opened the archives and you can find who was KGB. Those were two main objectives which I wanted to be the result, which need to be done.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI started doing this kind of work, because I want to start a conversation, I want to question things happening in society. To change it maybe. But I dont have any illusions, just to start the conversation. Artists should always ask questions, not answer it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor examle with \u201cdro\u201d \u201ctime\u201d billboard, there were millions of interpretations which always ended up with politics. My favorite versionwas one taxi driver who said that misha saakahvili had to make a talk on the video screen where our text was now on for new year and bidzina ivanishvili di not allow it and he burned it down, and then saakashvili was angry and wrote dro. And that's what I like, our work doesnt have any author, my connection to the text ends when we make it. The authors of the text are the people themselves. The interpretations and mythologies that they are building on these texts or words comes from their own conscious or unconscious.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFirst when we started it was much more linked to urban problems, and architecture. Like, abandned buildings and soviet stye buildings and creating a new language of the city. And that is what urban art is for me, creating a new language. Language of the people that can not talk or are invisible. That is one of the reasons that we are making spaces talk. Like, literally.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe first thing we actually made was a poem by Carlo Kacharava, he's a poet and writer from the 1990s and we made his poem, rally critical interesting texts on the wall. We wanted to make the city as a book and use contemporary not so poluar writers, because georgians are too much necrofilic, it's always about dead poets that are popular. But we only made one. It was a diificult project because too much work. I was teaching at the Centre for Contemporary Art at the time. I was making workshops and exhibitions with students together, and it was with students, 'instant street-art' and we had to make some work in urban space and with students we started making these words in pulic space. To be honest I was always more interested in art in public space than in a white cube. Because, espcially in georgia. No one goes to museums, in galleries you always see the same faces, so to bring the art to the people, you need to bring it out of these spaces. Also, art can be a tool, or like, if we tell really rough, it can be a tool for social changes and innovations. That's why it would be more interesting to continue working or in tbilisi or other small cities in social engaged art. BUT, there is no funding. It is impossible.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDetu and I always collaborate together. We sometimes work with others, but mostly with other curators and not with artists.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI am not sure what our skills are. Hacking Reality? Once we needed funding for something, 2000USD. On facebook we made a huge list with our skill set, but no one took it seriously. I guess now it would come in handy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe are also curating some projects, when we started. One was in CCA and one in an abondend building and the last we were thinking how can we change it? And then we try to get inspriation, it just happens. And now we are trying to get funding for one big project, which is about rethinking the city. We started working on it by thinking about what we are interested in and what are we inspired by. And also the problems the city has. Or society has. Rethinking the city: dividing the city into historical parts, from the 20<sup>th</sup> century. And we are thinking the periods through architecture and art. So the project starts on the nutsubidze plato (late 80ies) and we would like to have a festival there, then it continues to khrushokas 960ies), then old city, and crazy transformation in old city and devaluation of the cultural heritage. Power symbolics in soviet period and post revolution power symbols, it consists of seminars and lectures and urban art, etc. Quite a big project.\n\nIn this case we were combining our interests with problematics, what we think is most important now. Sometimes when I wake up ideas like this come to my mind, but often it just develops and shapes throughout the course of a year. We define how can we change the present and the future.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe largest obstacles we face are just funding, nothing else. Well, ok, human resources in a way as well. Experience that I have is that most of the people don't take their work serious here, or artists perhaps. Young artists. It's more like having fun than working and thinking theoretically. And that is why we are so fucked up in Georgia I think. And also the engagement, for example, we have participated in some workshops and projects which were on urban space, on the transformation of urban spaces \u2013 most problematic thing for me is that organizations are finding funding and just doing it for the sake of I don't know what. It doesn't have impact for me, no visible impact. The most important part of urban art is engagement of the local communities. And I have not seen that yet. But maybe we in Georgia don't have experience in that.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe dont want funding for the text based art, I am against funding street art. But the other projects which art participatory projects, that's where funding is needed. More curated projects with architects, urbanists and art historians. Such projects should be a tool to bring society something.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere is a problem that most of the people dont know, are are not close to new art, for most people public art is the golden statue of saint giorgi on freedom square. That is why iare Pekhit's projectGiorgi Makhradze's art was destroyed. Because hey just dont really understand. Or for example the bycicle on rose revolution square, today I passed by and part of the pedal is broken. Because people dont really understand the meanings. Contemporary art is a way of thinking. The professionals and artists should try to bring this information to people, it's a new and different way of thinking. If you think you dont have an agression and you wont destroy anything and you would think about changing future, present and even past. So, that's also a problem, to bring meanings and definitions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe most thing that I hate is paperwork. You need to do this to get funding or go somewhere, but I am not an accountant who likes this. Other things we need to do is research and get inspiration: thinking, drinking. But sometimes when I drink I cant work. Well, you know, it's like more, I cant describe it. I don't have systematized working schedules. Sometimes its spontaneous, but if there's a deadline it's much more organized.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat we would need, what I would like is exchange of knowledge. Human resources: clever people who have experience in this field. And seminars, workshops, etc. Intensive, and not just once per year. To exchange ideas and knowledge and experience.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI dont need media exposure. I usually refuse it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith the text based work I also dont want to discus it, afterward, it's like a game we're playing. It's out of my hands when it's finished.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor projects such as Rethinking the City we could use people who are more experienced, even artists. Invite artists and speakers \u2013 we are organizers and curators \u2013 and what we would need is people who experience in these kind of projects. If we wouldnt need any support we would be great.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt would be great of someone would support our trip around the world for inspiration, but what we really need is education, knowledge.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe are also in need of how to find funding, I am not so good at that, fundraising.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere in Georgia, similar initatives are GeoAir for example, or Iare Pekhit, but Iare Pekhit is more about public art and not about art with communities, etc. CCA, the what is cool is that there is a new direction, before the master course is a 9 month informal master program with installations etc etc, but now inclusive mediation is part. Each student has to do a roject with inclusive groups, an artistic project. Thats a great iniative, these are young artists that really have to get out of the white cube.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn Georgia, what is contemporary art, according to the ministry of culture, its funny. You can go to the museums and you are in a time machine, you go back to the 50ies for example. This year, Venice Beniel (I could not understand this, Mariam) on architectural, they could not find anyone, but they sent a group of fashion designers. And that does not make sense, that's like asking me to do accounting. But it happened because on the jury were people from certain institutions that still live in soviet times. They didnt rethink the way they were doing. Why in Georgia dont we have the museum for contemporary art, why is it not established by the ministry of culture?\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut I have a new attitude. Everything is so much, so destroyed. And we can not really erase it, for exaple the new building that is being build behind us. So why not make everything worse? As we cant erase it, we can at least make it worse.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPooling resources to me means bringing together peoples minds from different backgrounds and create more and deeper and diverse projects.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMutual support is a definition that does not exist in Georgia. Why is there an art scene in georgia, of 5 different groups, that then don't cooperate. Maybe it's the Georgian Ego. Last January we tried a collaboration of groups working in urban problematics: guerilla gardening, iare pekhit, tiflis hamkari, etc. First try failed. Now are only 4 or 5 organizations left that decided to work together, and last protest at the sulfur baths was organized. But I don't know. It is impossible to work together. Someone always has different ideas or different thoughts, and discussion doesn't exist here. Everybody just goes with their direction and doesn't want to share the ideas. Maybe also, you know, it is an issue of time, experience. It may also be fear. It is often communication problems.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen you are struggling and you have the same aim, you have to leave your ego behind. We can have different background, different ideas, when you have a difficult situation as we have here in Georgia now, in every field, why should you not collaborate and work together?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-17 00:19:35", "updated_at": "2018-06-16 18:08:56.180281", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3380, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 160.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6236, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6203, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>MEET THE OPEN CARERS</strong>\n\nA track within the OpenVillage Festival\n\n19-21 October 2017, Brussels\n\nAt the OpenVillage Festival you will meet protagonists of\u00a0initiatives\u00a0working together to make health- and social care accessible for all, privacy-friendly, secure and participatory....\n\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\n\n<tbody align=\"center\">\n\n<tr align=\"center\">\n\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"/node/6147\"><strong>Open Science &amp; Technology</strong></a></td>\n\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"/node/6151\"><strong>Mental and Spiritual Health</strong></a></td>\n\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"/node/6150\"><strong>Migration and robustness to Rapid Change</strong></a></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td align=\"center\">How are people all over the world using open knowledge, open source hardware and software solutions to meet care needs?</td>\n\n<td align=\"center\">\n\nWhat can we learn from off-the-radar Initiatives about how we can boost one another's' mental and spiritual health?\n\nand more..!\n\n</td>\n\n<td align=\"center\">What new or unconventional solutions can protect us from consequences of \"chaos in the system\" when we are most vulnerable i.e. refugee crises?</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\" class=\"content-section\">\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\" class=\"content-section\">A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Participate in\u00a0talks, fishbowls, workshops &amp; business development sprints</li>\n\n<li>Explore new technologies, methodologies &amp; collaboration opportunities</li>\n\n<li>Discover innovative new technologies, products and services\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">\u00a0</h2>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\" class=\"content-section\">\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\" class=\"content-section\">TICKETS</h2>\n\nTo get your ticket\u00a0<a href=\"/user/register\">create an\u00a0</a><a href=\"/user/register\">edgeryders</a><a href=\"/user/register\">\u00a0account</a>, then write to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:community@edgeryders.eu\">community@edgeryders.eu</a>.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<hr>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">#OpenVillage Festival</h2>\n\nFollow us:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1565289333786291/\">Facebook\u00a0</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http://twitter.com/edgeryders\">Twitter\u00a0</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http://opencare.us2.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=2426561089e1f5ab32da252cd&amp;id=566925d23f\">Newsletter</a>\n\nGeneral inquiries:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:contact@edgeryders.eu\">contact@edgeryders.eu</a>\n\nContributions &amp; Partnerships:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:company@edgeryders.eu\">company@edgeryders.eu</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\" class=\"content-section\">\u00a0</h2>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\" class=\"content-section\">Background</h2>\n\nFor most of humanity's history, care services \u2013 which today we call health and social care \u2013 were provided by communities: family members, friends and neighbours would check on each other to make sure everyone was fine, keep an eye on each other's children or elderly parents, even administer simple medical treatments. Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.\n\nThis new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology.<strong> </strong>However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain: the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people\u2026) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not. Additionally, any attempt to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.\n\n<strong>What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care?</strong>\n\nWe are attempting to do just that. Meet the OpenCarers will showcare the results of OpenCare, a two-year, 1.6 million euro research project to design and prototype new care services. By the end of this project we will have:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>collected experiences of community-driven care services</li>\n\n<li>validated them through open discussion, both online and offline.</li>\n\n<li>augmented them with state-of-the-art maker technology (3D printing, laser cutting, biohacking\u2026)</li>\n\n<li>combined everything we learn into the design and prototype of next generation community-driven care services.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThis is way too ambitious for us to do alone, so we are doing it with everybody, leveraging collective intelligence. The whole process is \u2013 and will stay \u2013 open to anyone who wants to participate. We operate under a social contract to acknowledge each and every contribution; we do not make participants into a crowd of rightless volunteers.\n\n<strong>Care is deeply human. Everyone has </strong><strong>first-hand</strong><strong> experience of it. Even those of us who are not doctors or nurses or caregivers are occasionally patients (even doctors!); we all have first-hand experience of giving and </strong><strong>recieving</strong><strong> care. So, everyone is welcome to join the conversation and the subsequent </strong><strong>prototypes.</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\" class=\"content-section\">Partner organisations</h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">\u00a0</h2>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c42df3dd45f23cced18fc0ddc2e5bfac811942cf.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"71\">\n\nThis track of the OpenVillage has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 688670\n\n<img src=\"http://opencare.cc/assets/OC-EC-H2020.jpg\">\n\n", "created_at": "2017-04-06 16:18:37", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 14:45:33.953252", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1011, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 36.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4044], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3612, "user_id": 2278, "topic_id": 3579, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>Int. 1 Alioune Sall \u00a0</strong>\n\nI think that the future is by definition\u00a0 unknown, because it is not yet here and it is unknowable. But what we can know is what are the determinents of the future and therefore when we talk about using the future we should say: using the knowledge that we have about the determinents of the future. That is my understanding of the phrase \u201cusing the future\u201d.\n\nFrom my experience working in African countries and thinking that they are all in difficult situation \u201cusing the future\u201d means trying to understand.. trying to answer a number of questions regarding Africa. One of the questions that we have to answer is \u201cWhere does Africa tends today?\u201d and \u201cWhere does it come from?\u201d then another question we need to ask ourself is \u201cWhere may Africa go?\u201d knowing that there is not only one possible future. There are many possible futures so we have to explore what are the possible future what are the possible trajectories. And another question that we have to ask ourself once we know \u00a0what are the possible futures we need to ask ourself which is the one we want to claim and how do we go about claiming the future that we want. So those are the kind of questions that we are trying\u00a0 seek answers too but what makes us I guess quite original or what set us apart from many of the groups which are involved in foresight exercise is that we do not are experts who try to provide the answer to those questions, we help create conditions we are by multiple numbers of stakesholder can provide inputs and try to answer the questions. We want to create a platform for dialogue on the current situation and the possible futures and the desired futures by africans themself\n\nMy name is Alion Sal, I\u2019m Senegalese by citizenship and African by choice and member of the global community by aspiration and I\u2019m the Executive Director of the Think Tank called African Future Institute which has its headquarter in Pretoria and which operates in more then 30 countries in Africa.\n\n<strong>Int. 2 \u00a0\u00a0Riel Miller\u00a0</strong>\n\nThe term \u201cusing the future\u201d is somehow unfamiliar for a lot of people because people don\u2019t think of using the future like you use a tool, like you would use an hammer, or like you would use an idea of the solar system to understand the planets and the Sun, but when you start to think about the future as something that enters into our decision making that enters into our way of seeing the World around us you begin to see that we use the future, the imaginary future, to understand the world around us. And so what we are trying do we try to understand how the future enters into our thinking and that\u2019s the idea of using the future.\n\nThe future is something that enters into our decision making, let me give you an example from a very early age: a baby would be able to see a marble go across a table and the baby would track with their eyes, before they can speak, they would track the marble going across the table, then if you put a barrier in front of the marble and you start here and you let it go the baby will look at the foresight even if he can\u2019t see the marble to expect the marble to come out at the far end. In other words they have the ability to think about the future, the future when the marble emerges from the other side of the barrier. This is a very early idea of the future and how we understand the future to look at the world around us. So we integrate the future into our thinking very early. I think it\u2019s also important to understand that humans use the future and we can talk about \u201cusing it consciounsly\u201d but trees also anticipate, in other words the future is an inherited part of our universe because Time and Space are part of our reality so right now we are sitting here, I\u2019m not moving from where I\u2019m sitting but our planet is moving so i\u2019m already somewhere else. So inherited to the very basic fabric of our reality is anticipation. Being somewhere else, being later in time. So when I talk about using the future, I\u2019m talking about the different ways that the future is introduced into the operational reality of a tree, of a human. To be part of the way we understand and act in the world.. for humans, and also the way we construct reality for unconscious beings, phenomena.\n\nAgain trying to take a systematic prospective, if we have an anticipatory systems view of the world, of reality that there are many different kind of anticipation that you have to look and examine the different anticipatory systems,\u00a0 unconscious human anticipation are immune system for istance as an anticipatory process. It get stimulated and even if you are not sick the immune system wakes up, it gets activated and so that\u2019s an anticipation, in the end then maybe you may not be sick but the immune system kicks in, without thinking, without consciousness. So the point about different ways of using the future and different anticipatory systems is that we are beginning to understand that all around us there are many kind of anticipation including, and here there is something very important that I want to signal, that is crucial for this conference but also crucial for the work we are doing, which is: there\u2019s a form of anticipation that\u2019s not preparatory, that\u2019s not about preparing, that\u2019s not about planning. When we hear anticipation, most humans, we say: anticipate to know what will but you can also anticipate by not doing! By standing back, that my anticipation is that I will not know what will happen later and I will wait, not in a passive way but in an active way of saying: how can I understand something that is emerging, something that is novel, something that is new? And one of the ways to have multiple lenses, many ways of seeing the present, have more open idea of the present, is to be non-colonizing, non imperial about the future. To have an idea that says: \u201cthe future? Who knows!\u201d and so it provides us with the capacity to be improvisational, in other words, if\u00a0 you wanna be more improvisational in the present, more spontaneous, more capable of appreciating novelty. One of the key skills is to give up the arrogance, the fear, the desire to know the future. And that is one way of anticipating that is not very well understood because everybody think that anticipating is about knowing the future but there is also a way of anticipating which is saying: I do not know the future and I don\u2019t want to know the future, I will allow my idea of the future to change continuosly so that I can see the present in different ways. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s seek the example of reading and writing ok? Let\u2019s immagine a moment ok? Where you come to a city and somebody says to you: there is something that tells you many things about this city, that you can discover many things about this city and it is not very difficult but if you don\u2019t have this skill, if you don\u2019t know, you won\u2019t see, you won\u2019t understand and the person says: oh you just imagine that, you are just making it up, it\u2019s just a fantasy but it\u2019s reading, if you can read the signs in the streets, if you can read the paper, the newspaper to find a job, if you can read in a supermarket or in a factory what to do, how to do things, all of the signs you have whole world that you can know about it. If we wanna be able to appreciate the richness or the uniqueness of every moment and every place. Because it\u2019s incredible we live in this universe where every place and every moment in spacetime is unique. This is the information. Most of it we throw away. Because we can\u2019t tell a story about it, because we can\u2019t summarize it, we can\u2019t stock it, we let it go. But if we can become better and appreciating the moment and the specificity we have this richness to drown on??? On context, of the past but also different ways of thinking about the future and we can expand our ability to see in the present. And so what I\u2019m saying is: the idea of being walking on two legs, one leg which is preparation and planning. And the other leg which is emergence and novelty requires preparation practice, capacity, so it\u2019s, from a human point of view, because we do concient anticipation, the tree is another story, but human conscious anticipation we can practice it, we can become better at it. It\u2019s just like if you know how to read, you can read many kind of books, good, bad, and you can write, and you can write nice things or terrible things. It gives us the capacity, it\u2019s a very open capacity and it must be developed. So that\u2019s the human skill. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe event where we are here the Knowledge Laboratory is in fact conceptualized as a change in the way we conduct research. Research is by creating knowledge and the idea is that we use collective intelligence, the people who is here, to create knowledge, ideas, facts, shared meaning, shared meaning things that we understand togheter. Becoming future litterate is something that from my experience occurs when you confront, engage, quietly (like) most learning that there is something that you don\u2019t know and you say: how can I know something about something that I don\u2019t know? First you must know that you don\u2019t know! Then you can say: ah! how do I begin to understand what is it that I don\u2019t know! And so the processes that I use when I construct a future leaderacy knowledge laboratory is: I bring people togheter, to work togheter, to confront the way they use the future and what\u2019s terrific is that is very easy really, everybody thinks about the future all the time. So if I ask you about the future of internet or the future of journalism or the future of this hotel, you have ideas, you say this.. and not.. and tourism.. or you say, you know, ..new economy, or you say all sorts of things and you will beging to see that you have a relationship to the future and that you use the future and slowly you will realize that you have assumption about the future and that is on the basis of these assumpions that you can imagine the future, and one of the really striking thing about the future is that it can be only imaginary, it doesn\u2019t exist for us to touch. You are obliged to have a model, you are obliged to make assumpions, but employment will be important in the future. The companies and farms will be important in the future, the world will be important in the future. You make assumptions and therefore you describe: peace or corporate monopoly or a free open internet. And you describe those things and you imagine the future and on the basis of what you\u2019ve imagined, you think about the present! So in a Knowledge Laboratory, that is aimed in developing people future litteracy as a learning process, learning by doing, we engage people to think about their future, something they care about. So in Sierra Leone we talked about the future of young people, in Brasil we talked about the future of innovation, in Norway we talked about the future of small innovator enterprises. In each place, with each group you talked about something that they cared about, their future something they think is important. As they talk about and they think about, they realize that they have assumptions, they realize that they are using the future for planning or for preparation, because it becomes obvious that they\u2019re trying to prepare for more competition or they\u2019re planning to be more innovative. And so they realize that they\u2019re using the future for preparation or planning very familiar human activities. Then as we move up the learning curve of the knowledge Laboratory, so we start from where people are already familiar and what they are already known, we try to create distance, we try to create a coordinated(?) awarness about doing it separate yourself from what you know and begin to think about what you think about. And to do that we reframe. Reframing is a moment when you say: what if there no schools but everybody is learning, how does it work? What if there\u2019s democracy but there\u2019s no president? How does that work? And people say: oh.. well\u2026 you know I made this assumption that the only way that democracy could work is if I have an election but maybe we can think about in a different way.. I thought the only way we could be whealty is it people have jobs but it\u2019s true that in the past there were no employment or firms where people have wheal this another way for us to do things. And they begin to question their assumptions, they begin to realize that if they change their assumptions they change their idea of the future and they begin to see that there are different ways of thinking about the future. And this builds up people\u2019s future litteracy. They begin to see that there are different ways of using the future, that there are different anticipatory systems and in the same way that when you become litterate and you can read, you begin to realize there\u2019s fiction and non-fiction, that there \u2018re mystery novels and romance novels, that there are newspapers and journalism and you begin to see that there are different ways you read, different ways that you can use your skill. So very tangibly the way to become future litterate is to learning by doing. And one of the reasons why I think is so important to do learning by doing is because the future matters a great deal. We care about the future, the future is so central to the way we exist, that if I tell you: you know you really didn\u2019t think about something that is very important to you. Why you feel worry, you feel nervous, you feel unsure, it doesn\u2019t feel good. But if I say to you: you can become better at something that is really central to you, really foundamental, then it\u2019s empowering, the it begins to build the capacity and then you can do what I said using another metaphor: you can walk on two legs instead of just hopping on one leg. And you can stop exclusively trying to colonize the future: Ah! I know what kind of job will be the job of the future, I\u2019ll go to university to have this job. And then it\u2019s where I fell secure. And we can begin to shift the contradiction that is really central to the current context we live in, which is between diversity and freedom and planning and determinism, and we can become more confortable with the idea that the unknown and the unknowable are central to our values of liberty but are also fundamental to our reality. The Continuosly creates the unknown and so instead of the unknown being an enemy, something we fear, something we wanna kill, because it\u2019s detrimental to planning we can find a way to be more balanced between planning and preparation and emergence and novelty.<strong style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</strong>\n\nI\u2019m Riel miller, I work at Unesco in Paris and I help people to think about the future.\n\nThere\u2019s another issue thet is worth but it\u2019s a little bit tangential. This eventi s called Knoledge Laboratory, and I think it\u2019s quite useful to recognize that the way we conduct research today it\u2019s not necessary the way we conducted research in the past. It\u2019s not to say that past research is bad but to say that we are adding new ways to do research. And one aspect of doing research is not about finding universals or general principles that last forever and that are applied to everybody but things that are specific to a particular place and context. And this very valuable because it reflects what people want and their diferences. So if we can become better at understanding contexts and understanding specificity we can actually improve our grasp, our appreciation of the world around us and also what we do. It\u2019s appropriate to where we are and where we are coming from, including our past, but also what we hope for the future in a specific place and in a specific time. it means we can begin to move beyond some of the methods that have been very effective of imitating Big Sister, imitating Big Brother, catching up with the advanced coutries, converging on one idea of development. Using the model of industry as the model for every society. In other words we can begin to be more inventive because we have more understanding of the actual foundation, the actual base. So the Knowledge laboratory, what we are running here, really uses this idea of collective intelligence and a process for discovering the models and the frameworks of the people who are there. And it\u2019s a way of making specificity more accessible. Now, for the old scientific statistical prospective the question become: how can you create Common Denominators? Because what we do very often in industrial society, in our current industrial framework, is we think about how can we create a general indicator, statistics, averages, and so we\u2019re continously looking in our conversations and in our research for this general scalable principles. But we specificity in time and space specific. And so again is a question of finding a balance, of be\u00a0 able to build up our ability to do both. So it\u2019s not one against the other but it\u2019s how to create more and more Knowledge Laboratories that use the people who are present. They are not a good sample, they are not rapresentative, they are not meant to be statistically general. And in fact many times you bring people togheter and they will think in their whole mind by reflects: how can I say something that is general? There would be an average? There would be success from a market, mass market prospective? But here the objective is not to find a mass market. It\u2019s to say: deepen your own understanding of your own situation, of your own moment of what\u2019s true here and now and it may not be true in an hour or in two days or in five years buti t gives you a deeper understanding of the reality as it is! If that is very expensive or if people don\u2019t look for it, we won\u2019t see it. But the idea of the Knowledge Laboratory is to be into work on the methods that allows it to be more accessible, easier to use. In the same way that we develop methods around statistics and we develop methods around mass and standers and norms, which are all crucial parts of building a model industrial society. So we\u2019re experimenting here and we\u2019re creating a situation that does create norms and standers for experimentation related to specificity not generality.\n\n<strong>Int. 4 Mrs. Jessica Bland\u00a0</strong>\n\nTo use the future is to use a time in a place that doesn\u2019t exist yet. And that allows you freedom to talk about things in a different way that you can do if you are talking about in the present. For this reason we are uncertain about the future and therefore we can often imagine different worlds and that\u2019s freedom to imagine It\u2019s very important when you develop policies or new forms of governments\u00a0 for countries or internationally.\n\nSo my main work is in the UK and therefore when I think of people in difficulty I think perhaps of people in less difficulty then other people we talk about here at this event run by the Unesco and Rockfeller. One piece of what we did with londonist or other communities in the city I grew up with can be en example\u00a0 because some people who live in London who do live in difficulty. We worked with an open engagement group on social life but also with technology and engineering companies like our, and also with some scientific fiction authors to imagine different kinds of londonists in decades time, so in ten years time. We thought not just about londonist who are hi flying businessmen and women, but also about londonists who really care about the city, that want to create new kinds of communities, and finally we talked about londonists who could really be suffering in the future, so people who work in vary unstable jobs, who is having to hack the public transport, access cards in order to travel around.\u00a0 in order to afford to travel around the city you need to have a much better job that the one they have. So we talked about very different kind of londonists, people who embody very different kinds of trends and we didn\u2019t just create this in precence to\u00a0 policy makers. We actually had a double page ad in one of the national newspapers in the UK and a four page ad in the London newspaper so we directed a campaign about this future London a policy makers which required to respond. So we use the future as part of the campaign, we didn\u2019t just use it to do an exercise, we publish in a journal, or in a paper , in a corner, somewhere, and we were very noisy about the future. And I think that really helps the people in difficult situation to think about the future that they want and not about the future that London\u2019s assembly or politicians want.\n\nMy name is Jessica Bland, I work at Nesta which is a Think Tank in the UK and I lead a research on futures and foresight primarily looking at cutting edge of new ways of doing this kind of work.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n<strong>Int. 5 Mrs. Natalie Phaholyothin\u00a0</strong>\n\nTo me using the future is getting out of a mainframe and being able to anticipate better one of the challenges that are coming your way. So it\u2019s a way of how do you better prepare for the future. It\u2019s about also being more flexible and how you react to unexpected changes within a framework that is still tangible and grounded. Using the facts of the past and of the present to extrapolate what the future might be. So to \u00a0me it\u2019s a way of better anticipating responses and better dealing with challenges. \u00a0\n\nI think the future can be useful when one needs to take a challenging decision in the sense that it allows you a new view which you may otherways not come through if you didn\u2019t use the future\u2019s lens. As the future\u2019s lens forces you to go out of your zone into a space where the factors of the decision making are different and new ones, so in that sense it\u2019s useful when you facing constraits in how you should move next. It\u2019s a mindshift, I think that\u2019s the usefulness of applying it in a challenging situation.\n\nHi, my name is Natalie Phaholyothin,I\u2019m the associate Director at the Rockfeller Foundation, Asia Regional office based iin Bangkok.\n\nMy area focused is to oversee the health program in the Asia region. I work in health system and supporting countries to improve health coverage as well as in disease surveillance networks.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Int. 3 Mr. Kewulay Kamara\u00a0</strong>\n\nMy understanding of \u201cusing the future\u201d is that first of all every action that we actually take we consider the future. We consider sometime beyond today, beyond this moment and that\u2019s the future. But all of us has implicit assumption about the futer, about what is gonna happen today, what is gonna happen tomorrow, i don\u2019t know in an year or so, we have those assumptions. A lot of times if those assumptions create in our heads possible scenarios what we\u2019ve made or not. But sometimes this scenarios are almost like given, we think this is it! But on the line assumption to every scenario, every way that we think of the future they are on the line assumption. So using the future, being conscious of how you see the next day, how you envision the next day and what you anticipate, what your actions are based on some or foundamental assumptions that you have, that you may or may not be aware of. Ok using the future to me is, first of all, begin to grab on those assumptions and those assumptions are usually hidden so the process of using the future is really making the invisible visible. And you do that not just as a scholar, as a someone engaged, an actual partecipant in this. That\u2019s one aspect of using the future, the other aspect of using the future, somehow we often have this foundamental assumption that talk to us that somehow the future is something that is given that can be discovered, look in a glassbowl or something or you can look in a stone and find out what the future is. But while I\u2019m not saying that we can do that but it was tough to reject to many of us what it was think of that future is going to happen. this is something that is already in your head, ok? Its planted already in some form of order. We have many institution that teach us what hte future is. What using the future is understanding that no! The future is really unknowable. You don\u2019t know the future. What that it means that there\u2019s plenty of room for exitement and there\u2019s plenty of room for creativity you see. You know you can accept the unknown you can be open to that so this is in a way liberating, in a way, it gives you the freedom to be able to create, to be able to colaborate, to be able to imagine other futures that those imagination are just as made even more valid that the forecast and the mathematical formulation that it will come up with, and there\u2019s unloaded with the line assumptions that people who is doing the forecasting and the prediting are not even in a way off. So using the future is really for anyone no matter what\u2019s the level of the individual or the level of the state or the level of an organization. Using the future allows you to realize that freedom to actually imagine and to create.\n\nI think people not only use the future in confortables situation but they also use it in crisis situation, let me go back. Using the future in crisis situations help actually to deal with crisis, deals with difficult situation. So imagine that what I\u2019m talking about that in fact even in this crisis situation there are opportunities they open up, when this crisis situation come a lot of time because they will sometime in the future, they will sometime in the future. What is reality today what is actual point in the future. So therefore what we do today actually shapes the future. How do you think of using the future in the present is to say: What I think today what I do today. As allowed to do with how the future is going to be. That may be on a very small scale of individuals and that we\u2019re talking about or we can talk about groups, we can talk about countries, we can talk about humanities. But how you deal with this situation is a story that you tell, yes. How do you place the crisis that you are now facing in history, in your story. How does your story it does? If you\u2019re in your story,\u00a0 of the past into the present and going to the future and catastrophy is what you see, this current situation, in my estimation, is going to lead only to catastrophy. It can hardly see something good coming out of it. It\u2019s an honour for you to be able to see the opportunity of change. The opportunity to imagine other futures, and after have a story, you have to create a story, so I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m talking like a story teller but I think story it\u2019s very very important in actually how we deal with the situation, how we see tomorrow and how we act today to bring about tomorrow.\n\nMy name is Kewulay Kamara. I am a story teller and in the past few years I\u2019ve been very involved in understanding the discipline of how we understand the future, how we look at use the future. I\u2019m Sierra Leonian, I\u2019m from Sierra Leone\u00a0 but I live in New York so I actually live in Sierra Leone and New York.\n\n<strong>Int. 6 Fred Dust\u00a0</strong>\n\nAt IDAO, one of the things that we believe is that there is not one future, there\u2019s actually many futures. So one of the things that we believe is that to can perceive one future in forward actually can set you down a path of big mistakes. So one of the things that we try to do in our work is to envision as many possible futures as we can to sort of say: if we were banking on three or four of these scenarios to become true, which of the one that actually might succeed? And how everything else would have changed? And so one of the things we believe is you use the future to set a kind of guide for you as an organization, for you as a country, for you as an individual, to guide you to where you wanna go and then the actions you wanna take.\n\nI guess a couple of things on thinking about how people can think about their future and use it as a tool. One thing again who is affecting by the idea that we believe there are multiple futures is that: There are times when the future is dated out and there are times when future is using you out so an example is: we were working with Greece, just before the beginning of the significant crisis and we were working on kind of thinking about the future democracy frankly that was used out but the reality was the real future, the crisis was actually only dated out so in fact the question of what is democracy didn\u2019t like matter when you basically saying: does the country even exist. So the first thing we have to do is make sure your timeline is correct for the context that you are in. is it future three years out?, is it future three weeks out? Or is it three hours out? And make sure you are thinking that way first. I guess the other think that we think about in terms of future tool is: we like it best when you\u2019re envisioning a future that is actionable and you can take action on. So you can see something and say: if I\u2019m gonna flip this switch, this switch, make this move with my organization, we can move to order this future. And we can not act future when they are so abstract that you don\u2019t know how to act on.\n\nSo I think the most important thing when you think about the future for an organization or for you as an individual is make sure that you\u2019re actually envisioning things if they are actionable. So actually things that you can use to guide your actions and move you forward. One of the things that we found most difficult is in people envision a future where you are an extreme one, they basically say, \u2026 way out this location and there is no move you can make then the reality is \u2026a very useful future. So one of the things we\u2019ve been talking about downstairs is: it\u2019s not just enough to say here is the future as we see it but actually we have to kind of come back from there and say: here are the steps that I will take into that future and here are the things that we can do now to actually make them happen.\n\nI\u2019m Fred Dust, I\u2019m a partner at IDAO and I work a lot with organizations that are thinking about how to think about their future and what kind <strong>of disruption ?</strong> will gonna come down the path. \u00a0\n\n<strong>Int. 7 Tanja Hichert\u00a0</strong>\n\nThere are of course many different ways of using the future but I guess I like using the future and the term using the future in quite a disruptive way to open up space in the present, for changing dialogue, for thinking about things differently, for doing differently and for coming up with alternatives, because ultimately these enourmous challenges that face all of humanity which is essentialy human development, you know, I live and I work in Africa, so this incredible human development challenges but at the same time this is the incredible challenge of a system not able to substain this continued human development that needs to happen. So by using the future it\u2019s all about adding an extra dimension to the present. In terms of so what? How do you react, what are the things that you do, how do you change the dialogue, so for me is essentially a disruptive , positively disrupting\u00a0 activity of opening up the space of thinking differently, doing differently, making different decisions and choices in of course very difficult challenging situations.\n\nIt\u2019s a work example and it\u2019s something that has been done last year with the help of the Rockfeller foundation, thank you Rockfeller foundation, around dialogues of the informal cities and the informal cities in the global society. So I was really very privileged and lucky to work on two cases: Nairobi and Chennay, where the job was deliver scenarios for how these cities could look very different or could have different futures and in given to those futures one of the decision that people in the informal sector could take to empower themselves. So people in the informal sector are very often at the mercy of the large economic forces or even well meaning forces. One to regulate things to trying shift the economy in a certain way and if you are in the informal sector that\u2019s your livelihood and it\u2019s your survival. And the project was not just about generating scenarios about how things could be different, it was very much structured around: what if you got these scenarios and you experience what the life could be like, what do you do in and on the basis of that generating ideas and actually prototyping and showing ideas, building ideas, materially, on how to iprove lifes given this incredible constrain of being poor being in the informal sector, being outside of the regular system. So it\u2019s not just useful, it\u2019s extremely empowering to use the future.\n\nI\u2019m Tanja Hichert I work as a strategic foresight or future studies practictioner, so I get to do the actual work with people generate scenario I do <strong>??? signal scanning?.</strong> I do a lot of work around risk scenarios so what I really do is \u2026.. to do this work so over and above all that doing, which is mostly in African coutries, I also look to keep a little foot in Accademia, the Institute for Future studies at the University of Stellenbosch \u2026 they keeps me a little bit honest and the rest pays the bill!<strong> (</strong>Laugh)\n\n<strong>Int. 8 John Sweeney\u00a0</strong>\n\nWell, for me using the future is always using futures. So we use alternative futures as a means of getting people think of their preferred future but also realizing that when we talk about the idea of THE future, that is an open dynamic a space of multiplicity, a space of possibility. So when we use the future in our work we\u2019re always using futures, alternative futures, future studies and that\u2019s because we see it as an open space. Now, it\u2019s not fully open, I think that\u2019s a space that can be <strong>contested? </strong>So we wanna help groups, organisations, communities find ways and decolonizing the future, making the future more egalitarian, making it more just. So we use it as a plural, it\u2019s more of a verb and then a noun.\n\nSo we\u2019ve seen the future used as a space to express hopes and aspirations but also to think critically about things that we\u2019d like to change today. So I was on a team that went to Myanmmar, or Burma, and we put together the Myanmmar futures exchange which was at the time the largest and actually the first foresight event to get people together and to give them tools to think about the future. Now when we say tools to think about the future it\u2019s really enhancing the way we think about the future so we talk about future\u2019s literacy, future\u2019s thinking. And what we found in those contexts was that it really allowed to have new conversations, it allowed them to challenge the existing norms. In a place like myanmmar Burma you have all sorts of norms related to elders so initially if you have a conversation the older would speak and everybody else would listen. But the tools and exercises that we used and created allowed for more collaborative , more participatory means that examining things that are happening today and also the future context. So I think in many developing or many emerging contexts the use of the future can be a way of enlivening new types of conversations, new ways of engaging and thinking in many ways challenges that are here today but I think more importantly the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow.\n\nSo we talk about decolonizing the future or ultimately talking about making the implicit forces that are driving the way the world is today explicit so we can understand what impacts they might have on the future. So we talk about decolonization that has anything to do with making sense of the present reality and we look at forces that are having a dramatic effect. So what is the effect of neoliberal capitalism, what is the effect of multinational corporations? The actors that seem to have more power, more agency- how is it that we can make sense of their impact and effect on the future, such that we can include more voices in the processes that will help us create the kinds of futures that I think are more just, more egalitarian for more people because ultimately we can see today that the present is actually a past version of some notion of the future and obviously we wanna help make the future better for more people so we do that,and we think it is necessary to do that by creating more voices and having more people participate. So decolonizing the future has everything to do with not making the future a monologue, not even making it a dialogue but what we would call a polilogue. Multiple voices, multiple people, people being able to express their viewpoints in a genuine collaborative space for creative engagement about what might come.\n\nI am John Sweeney, I am the Deputy Director at the Center for Postnormal policy in Futures studies. I am also a researcher at the Hawaii research center for future studies.\n\n<strong>Int. 9 Judith Aidoo file 9867</strong>\n\nFor me using the future means imagining the future to direct the present, and for that you have to dream expansively, to think about things you never thought about, in the ways you never thought about, in some ways train yourself, your mind, your spirit to see thing you had never seen before. And for me the way to do that is to imagine, to create, like a game, a sense of the future of what\u2019s possible so that we can actually start to work today. That\u2019s what I think about.\n\nSo I wanna give you an example. In Ghana we are getting a group of people together every month- creatives, thinkers, lawyers, architects, artists, musicians\u2026anybody who\u2019s creative by nature. And we\u2019re getting them together to think about, to explore what\u2019s happening on the ground , how are people imagining or reimagining our culture, our art, our buildings with a particular purpose in mind: we know that Africa is going to almost double in the next 20 years. It will be the youngest continent in the world, and no one has thought through, at least no one that we can see, how to address this <strong>???</strong> opportunity and some people call it a challenge of massive explosive growth in a very short period of time and particularly growth that\u2019s gonna be urbanized. So this means that anybody who can think creatively out of the box, who can imagine something that\u2019s never been seen before and come up with creative solutions <strong>addresses???</strong> we wanna give these people room, we wanna incourage people. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re doing right now on the ground. We are literally bending together, we\u2019ve been doing this literally for years and so there\u2019s a collective of thinkers coming together to divine what\u2019s possible given these opportunities/challenges that we\u2019re gonna be facing. It\u2019s very exciting!\n\nHi, my name is Judith Aidoo, I am from Ghana, and also from the United States, but I live most of the time in Accra, Ghana, West Africa. I am an investment banker and a lawyer by training and I love thinking about the future in innovative ways with really smart, bald people that encourage me.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Int. 10 Peter De Smedt\u00a0</strong>\n\nI work in a governmental organization so we are using the future to offer policy makers a valid point of reference in the future. Why is that needed? The future, we cannot predict, so there are multiple possibilities, or futures, how our society can developand what we are doing at foresit work is that we think, together with older people, what are the possibilities, how can the future enroll, and we try to, by having conversations we try to think what kind of futures are possible and are making sense to policy makers for their work. So we use foresight and we use the future to give information, to give advice to policy makers so that they better understand not only the possibilities of how society will develop but also the potencial today and how their decisions today will have an impact on the future.\n\nUsing the future is something we start doing almost by birth. In a way we have expectations, we have needs, and by thinking at what can happen or how we hope that things will happen we are using the future, so what happens when you are in stress or difficulties often your first reaction is fear there was some negative experience and it often creates fear so that\u2019s one future image that people can have. What we can offer people is first to acknowledge there is only one out of the potential futures they have and two, to give them tools, to give them practice, experience, and insights how they can for themselves take a step back and try to see if there are other futures out there. And that capacity also gives them the flavor or gives them the ability to think on positive futures. So in a way you can strenghten people, you can build up resilience in your society by providing people tools to acknowledge that the first reaction is fear, that there are other possibilities and that they can, by taking a step back, and using future thinking, allow them to have hope, to think about possibilities, and also to share these tools. Resilience is also about being connected with people so doing the future thinking , sharing the future images with older<strong>(OTHER?)</strong> people will also help you to accept what is happening now and to have kind of shared dreams of better futures.\n\nMy name is Peter De smedt I\u2019ve been working in the foresight future field for more than twelve years and currently I work in Brussels for the JRC \u2013 the JRC is the Joint Research Center it\u2019s the in-house science department of the European commission.\n\n<strong>Int 11 Sohail Inayatullah\u00a0</strong>\n\nI think I like the term using the future because it implies the future as an asset. If it\u2019s an asset we can mould it, we can shape it, we can create it, we can play with it. And in the real world the way people use the future one is tools and methods: here\u2019s a tool let\u2019s use it let\u2019s see what happens. Level 2 is strategy let\u2019s use the future to get to a particular space to be more optimum, more competitive. But deeper than that is using the future for transformation so it\u2019s not just about a tool or strategy but about transforming who I am, who you are, what a city is, what a country is. So I see three core <strong>???</strong> using the future, from tools to strategy to transformation.\n\nIf I\u2019m in a difficult situation or someone\u2019s in a difficult situation two things are helpful: one, the future becomes the vision, the purpose. If I\u2019m caught in the present and there is some difficulty the use of the future is \u201cwhere am I going, what\u2019s my goal, what\u2019s my preferred future? \u201d . So that\u2019s a very powerful way to stay purpose-based. The second one is a little technique so often when I can\u2019t make a decision I ask myself from the future \u201cwhat do I do?\u201d I ask myself with 80 years old \u201cwhat should I do? What did you do?\u201d and the voice from the future that tells me \u201chey, today here\u2019s the right thing to do\u201d. So the use of the future is: one, ensure in difficult times you\u2019re purpose-based. Two, to ask myself \u201cwhat did myself from the future say?\u201d so I make a temporal link.\n\nMy name is Sohail Inayatullah I live in Australia as well as other parts of the world and I work throughout asia pacific and the world.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Int 12 Claudia \u00a0Juech </strong>\n\nUsing the future in our context means we are using elements of future methodologies and future contexts to identify opportunities that might have high impact potential for the rockfeller foundation. So we basically are trying to understand what forces are shaping the future in a certain space, for example the problem of maternal nutrition, malnutrition and how can we use those forces to basically cathalyze them, leverage them to create stronger action.\n\nUsing the future is very helpful to prepare for critical situations because one thing that we do when we are using the future many times we are developing alternative worlds how can the future play out in different ways, going forward and in terms of creating more\u00a0strategies to deal with challenges whe can think about what are the strategies that would really cut across those different worlds and would be applicable\u00a0 in different contexts that might emerge because we don\u2019t know what the future is going to look like so that is one way how we can use the future to deal with challenging situations.\n\nSo by resilience we understand the ability of individuals, communities and systems not only to withstand a cue chalks but also do deal with chronic stresses such as environmental degradations and not only to withstand but also to balance back stronger. Why is that concept critical for us? Because I mean, people particularly poor, vulnerable people face constant challenges, crisis and chronic stresses and resilience is a concept <strong>\u00a0</strong>to think about how can we strengthen the ability to deal with those challenges in a better way and to emerge from them more strongly and it\u2019s interesting there is actually a strong relation to using the future and future methodologies because one of the elements to think about resilience that strengthens the resilience of individuals and communities is the ability to anticipate. So anticipate broadly and then to think about how can we prepare for those events. There are other elements of resilience as well around modularity so are there/is there a way to see \u2026we see approaches for example so it\u2019s normally a decentralized approach Is better than a centralized approach in many cases because then you have elements that could step in if another one fails . but the ability to anticipate is actually also a critical element of strengthening resilience.\n\nMy name is Claudia Juech And I am Associate Vice President at the Rockefeller foundation.

I am kinda new here and I have a question: here we talk about volunteerism, could we define it a bit? I was an EVS volunteer myself (that is how I got to Georgia where I live on-and-off ever since 2010), and I met Georgians who were going or were already back from volunteering abroad. EVS as a program is great for a young person to expand her horizons, explore new cultures and find her own path in life. However, I would say that \"the spirit of volunteering\" is the main motivation for EVS-es (here I can add other paid volunteering opportunities such as TLG (Teach and Learn with Georgia, done that as well; PC...) - a lot of them are driven by the chance to see the world, experience different cultures or escape difficult economic situation at home (aka - no jobs). But not by a need/will to change the world and make a community a better place per se. In addition to that, as a \"volunteer\" I felt prety awkward in Georgia knowing that my income/volunteering stipend - call it whatever is higher than my neighbor's who has a real job (shop seller, bank teller etc..) job in Georgia. I am not even talking about TLG program when us, the international \"volunteers\" were getting paid 1.5 the amount that the Georgian English teachers whom we assisted....\n\nTo sum up, I feel that there is a big difference between volunteering abroad and getting paid for that (+all the extra awesome foreign experience) and between volunteering in your own local community. I think that the first type of volunteers are mostly (I am not saying all of them!) driven by their private and personal motivation (=personal growth, experience, languages, new friends, see the world...) as oppose to the second type of volunteers who are more likely to be driven by the need and the will to bring changes to their own front yard and the people that live there.\n\nWhat would be your guys thoughts on this?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-29 14:12:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.196262", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 349, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22790], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7492, "user_id": 809, "topic_id": 1405, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>So how is your new type of family like?</b>\n\nIs is based on friends or ...more than one life partner...or young people only ?

That's gonna be the reality check. :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-02-18 11:24:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:07.130081", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 151, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9331], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8236, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 5615, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Overview</b>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b46594e6cbee7bedb8dc44c8cd3c263a9b20ac83.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"117\">\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-11 14:39:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:47.737203", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 29, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20254, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3933, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Protocol :-)</b>\n\nI agree, more than you might think. <a href=\"/t/the-quest-for-protocol-1-0-testing-unmonastic-life-myself/3052\">In fact...</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-21 23:57:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:52.753469", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1305, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1272, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi, I had been thinking about this since I saw the mission and had decided to just let something drift my way. \u00a0Yesterday Jean Russell, another Edgeryder, posted a link to a <a href=\"http://emergentbydesign.com/2011/11/09/superhero-school-an-epicenter-for-disruptive-innovation/\">post about\u00a0building a school for Superheroes</a>, a kind of environment where learning/education/entrepreneurship overlap:\n\n<blockquote>\"\u00a0A live/work campus with elements of a university, Plato\u2019s Academy, an ashram and a monastery. A place to feed your mind, body and soul.Where people express what their humanity means to them through art, technology, music, experiential learning, sustainable practices, aesthetics, and togetherness.An action-orientation of prototyping, experimenting, risk-taking, rapidly iterating, and propagating what works. Incubating startups and projects. A collaboratory to bootstrap local and regional solutions to our most pressing \u2018wicked problems.\u2019\"\n\n</blockquote><div>I thought the idea sounded pretty cool so I followed the link to out what she had written about it and came across an extensive list of\u00a0\u00a0\u2018collaboratories compiled by Venessa Miemis as part of her research (Venessa wants to found this school), and thought it would make for a good mission report :) \u00a0According to Venessa, a collaroboratory\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboratory\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(119, 33, 36); font-weight: bold; \">defined as</a>\u00a0\u00a0a \u201ccenter without walls\u201d that could be a second home to a lot of different change agent organizations;</div><div>\u00a0</div><blockquote>\n\n<div>\"For instance, \u00a0the\u00a0<a href=\"http://the-hub.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(119, 33, 36); font-weight: bold; \">Hub</a>\u00a0could have a presence there,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.common.is/\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(119, 33, 36); font-weight: bold; \">COMMON</a>\u00a0could launch some socially conscious enterprises there,\u00a0<a href=\"http://opensourceecology.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(119, 33, 36); font-weight: bold; \">Open Source Ecology</a>\u00a0might build some equipment there, and a hacker collective could run a bootcamp there. There could be programs for teaching children to code, mentorships with high school students to guide them from idea incubation to entrepreneurship, and events around any number of topics, like arts and culture, technology, business, sustainability, or spirituality.She found hundreds of\u00a0existing examples of these types of spaces around the world.

The fact that we live in an earthquake prone area geologically requires new kind of thinking in the way we live and conduct our social and economic activities. Around 9000 peoples lost their life and thousands were injured. Around 5 lakhs houses were totally destroyed and 2.5 were partly damaged. We are on the verge to reconstruct our nation. We need to build back better (BBB). One door policy needs to be maintained for proper management of funds and its equal distribution. Foreign country and organizations are willing to support for the reconstruction. Our requirements must be addressed according to our need, and then only it will be appropriate for us.\n\n<strong>Reconstruction after Disaster</strong>\n\nThis is a disaster but we can take it in a positive way and turn it into an opportunity. I would like to share a story from Mr. Anil Chitrakar. We must have heard about a mega earthquake around 1300 BS where nearly half of the Kathmandu valley was destroyed and several thousand peoples lost their life including king Abhaya Malla. That mega disaster gave us an artist that takes our country\u2019s name to Tibet and China. When that earthquake happens Arniko was 12 years old and as we know that he was involved in making stupa from the age of 16. So probably after that mega earthquake he was involved in reconstruction of the stupa and temples in Nepal. And that experience grooms him and he became a renowned artist. Similarly this time also, nearly 7000 temples and stupas are damaged that needs to be reconstructed. Involvement of our artists with newcomers in this sector can bring great revolution in our wood work and crafting and this doom scenario can be turned into golden era by producing more and more Arnikos.\n\nLanduse plan must be strictly followed. Building code needs to be renewed and implemented. Certification of building must be provided. Not only urban but Semi urban area as well as rural area needs to be planned properly in an eco-friendly way. Rainwater harvesting, solar panels as well as other things are to be taken care of during rebuilding. Knowledge of technicians is must. Landslide zonation map as well as earthquake hazard map should be consulted before building any type of infrastructure. Alternatives infrastructures must be constructed that may be helpful in upcoming disasters. Airport and highway is the dire need of the nation.\n\nRebuilding of nation should be done under monitoring of government. Monitoring must be done from planning to implementation phase. We are talking about resettlement of the victims. We must keep in mind about \u00a0sustainable cultural values. Citizens from hills should not be resettled to Terai and vice versa. Resettlement needs to be done in same district. We must use local product for the reconstruction of the nation. If we are importing goods to reconstruct building and infrastructures it will flow cash to other nation. This won\u2019t be better for our economy. We must make better use of local available materials. Post disaster management works should be locally led, as local knows what the community needs and\u00a0 what can be done. Local knowledge is needed because the technology of foreign country might not suit directly to our community. These resources can help us carry out sustainable rehabilitation and reconstruction at low cost. We need help from foreign donors but the reconstruction must be according to our values, social cultures and needs. I guess nobody needs our country to be called as \u201cmade in china\u201d. Feelings of ownness and emotional attachment can only be maintained through involvement of our resorces and manpowers.\n\n<strong>Reviving the economy, financing reconstruction and promoting growth</strong>\n\nWhile ensuring human security and human development is of utmost importance, both these aspects require financing which clearly is based on having a robust economy that can support the expenses to be made for post disaster management. Similarly, such disaster earthquake can be turned into opportunities for reform (as it was done in Gujrat, India) therefore, financing reconstruction, reviving the economy and promoting growth needs a simultaneous strategies\n\nNow, the time is to think of our economy. Our economy is based on agriculture, tourism, industry and remittance. Talking about agriculture, we should make survivors independent and self sustained. Its better to teach them how to fish rather than providing fish to eat. if we are not going to plant crops in this monsoon then we have to import it. If we are doing so then we are being dependent and that\u2019s not good at all. If our farms stay barren this season then it is going to cost a long term effect.\n\nNearly all the international medias are showing that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nepal is totally ruined. But this is not the reality and we need to make them aware of that. We can invite renowned celebrities to visit our nation. That will attract international medias and ultimately we can take benefit from it. We can give a positive message and can promote tourism and make them aware that Nepal is still standing. This time we need a brand to promote our tourism after the earthquake. It can be Great Himalaya trail. It is trekking route along high hills of Nepal which is about 800km long. It touches every area of the high hills. If we are branding this route, tourists would come to visit and tourism will create employment that leads to overall development in those areas of Nepal.\n\nTourists are fond of nepali culture and architecture. We can turn this destruction into opportunity. We are going to reconstruct our monuments and we can charge tourists to observe them. Similarly while most of our monuments are damaged we can charge them to visit that particular area even more than the usual charge.\n\nMost of international medias are showing the destruction of Kathmandu. Now what we need to show them that only Kathmandu is not Nepal. We have many more destinations other than that. In this context we can find many more unexplored part of Nepal. New destinations will make people rise and grow. It will provide opportunity for every citizen over there to earn money.\n\nWe can\u2019t ignore industry and private sectors. They need support. Governments should help the industry by providing financial support. It would be great help to them if we can provide some facilities in their loans.\n\nWe must rebuild country that will cope with all kinds of disasters that is earthquake, floods, landslides and others. An independent authority needs to be established to look after disasters. Nature doesn\u2019t needs us we need nature. So we must build our nation nature friendly. We can rise above rubble and bounce back. Let\u2019s rebuild Nepal in a smart way so that we can meet our total development goal that is to be a developing country by 2022.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-27 10:47:14", "updated_at": "2017-08-28 11:17:34.725571", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1193, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2560, 2687, 2554], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14434, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1764, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Sounds promising ...</b>\n\nA bit late for a reply, but it does not mean that your ideas are not interesting. To the contrary :) So, let me add some feedback ...\n\nFirst, with the idea of finding ways to compensate people for their crowdsourcing contributions you're on to something big, I think. Crowdsourcing is severely limited in volume right now because it requires putting in limited resources (time, ...) for free. Compensation in money is not an option, since money is scarce by itself. If some other way of compensation is found, a whole new level of civic activity could be unlocked. We're right onto the same idea with Economy App ...\n\nI'm not sure if a gamified points system like proposed by Alberto would afford what you have in mind. For example, the MT2019 points system can be easily exploited (I had to edit my user profile several times, and got points each time). Which is not a problem right now, but can become one where points bear real value.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a the open source <a href=\"http://communityforge.net/\">Community Forge</a> Drupal module, which provides a full-scale community currency system. Designing a special purpose MT2019 currency that actually works is possible (I think), but I don't know how to do it. It's difficult ... see for example the <a href=\"https://respondingtogether.wikispiral.org/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=173\">Community Currencies Tutorial</a> for a start and points of reference. How difficult it is depends however on how much value people will have to trust the currency in: providing work for the MT2019 preparations for 200 EUR total value requires less trust in the currency than if one has 5000 EUR equivalent value on the community currency account finally ...\n\nEconomy App avoids the problems that make successful community currencies so difficult to start and maintain (namely, collectivized trust, the free rider problem, and managing the money supply if it's about fiat money). But the Economy App approach has its own limitations which come from the network barter concept. Namely, it can only match current demand with current offers, as there's no way to save up or make debts across barter deals. So I don't know how applicable it would be for the MT2019 scenario, as people would have to choose right at the point when providing services what rewards they want (hotel discounts etc.) finally. Apart from that, the network barter concept is not ready for general use by now, and for LOTE3 only for test usage.\n\nHowever, if Matera would be looking medium-term for a value exchange / civic engagement system that is there to stay, not tied to a specific event like the capital of culture thing, I could well imagine that Economy App could fill that role. It would be esp. good at rewarding people for small \"cowdsourcing\" contributions, as Economy App has (already) an integrated project management software where one can outsource a task with a few clicks. After outsourcing it, \"the crowd\" can apply for the task, and during one of the next network barter deals, the task will be awarded to one applicant whose needs can be met in that network barter trade. Thus the \"reward\" is instant. Tasks are meant to be atomic units of work that can be done without knowing the full project context \u2013 like, translating some text; hosting some person. (For larger and more long-term collaborations, one would authorize time to contribute to a project in Economy App.)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-07 20:12:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:21.503354", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 604, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30148, "user_id": 2470, "topic_id": 4294, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Very good, thanks!\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-14 07:40:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:46.044379", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2415, "user_id": 1680, "topic_id": 2382, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Sooo, we talked about Portugal.

I always want to double things. So if you say you want 200 people, I say 'let's shoot for 400!' (not at!). Is 400 too many? I'm confident we can hit this number. And not just any old people, excellent people. (but unexcellent people won't be excluded, of course (Or will they?)). And given 200+ people, I think plenty of space for camping would be a big plus. It could work if people are hosted in many different places, couchsurfer style, and attending meetings in one central location. But I'm thinking it would be cool for everyone to be sleeping in the same place, and have the meetings in giant tents or something. Then there is no issue with people needing to leave cos they have to catch public transport back to their hosts, or whatever. The meetings can go on all night! Thoughts?\n\n((And then a wild idea comes to mind: What if we contrive some way to own the land, then we never have to leave the unDojo. It's not a priority to go this far, just... what if? Is anyone inspired by the thought? You know what? I might buy the land for the tent village, but not tell anyone. Then after a cool first week, 70% of the people will say 'hey, i wish we could stay for a few more days (cos our subgroup still hasn't finished this cool project we're working on)\" and I'll be like \"You can. No problem. I know the guy that owns this land and he's pretty chill\". Then soon enough people will forget about asking if they have to leave, and they'll lose track of time, and magical things will be produced unMon sty-lee (pigs). . . . . . . . . . . Do I live in an insane castle in the sky? Yes, but it's real! History will be the judge. If you grok with this idea, dare to dream with me. If you don't grok, no worries, Dorotea will give you a cool LOTE no matter what. (and I will still help her)))\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-28 22:54:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:12.980032", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 485, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16523, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1255, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>what about other strategies to find work?</b>\n\nHey Lyne!\u00a0\n\nFirst of all thank you very much for being so honest about your experience. it's courageous of you to share it with us since you obviously tell the story in a very intimate way.\n\nIt seems dramatic, but I'd like to think it is not necessarily so. I don't know anything about these job search programs, but i find it weird that those people acted out on you the way they did, given that you were there to learn things.

During the first day he will run a small workshop with the people of Matera to share the technique - so that other buildings and places throughout Matera can be mapped and shared online. This will be followed by a second workshop on Saturday focused on co-designing the layout and utilities of unMonastery. By the end of the weekend we\u2019ll be sharing the first iteration of the model online so that we can begin to design and coordinate the creation of unMonastery internationally.\n\n<strong>Actionable Outcomes:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>3D Model of the unMonastery Building shared online.</li>\n\n<li>4 Hour Workshop with local community on the mapping exercise</li>\n\n<li>Online tutorial in English and Italian</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Reviewing the Challenges, Updating Matera and Co-writing the International Call</h3>\n\n<strong>Saturday</strong>\n\nFor this event we will be giving a series of short presentations, firstly a write up and break down of the challenges that were initially outlined by those in Matera in March; with a discussion about priorities, resources and additional information for each challenge. This workshop aims to produce a top 20 challenges for unMonastery Matera and will act as the baseline by which we select applications for the opening of the project.\n\nThe second short presentation will present a few of the pledges made from the EdgeRyders network, with a Skype in presentation from Matthias Ansorg to explain his\u00a0<a href=\"/economy-app\">Economy App</a>\n\nThis session will then culminate in the co-writing of the international call for pledges and applications. Clear challenges will be framed within the unMonastery model for project types, which is as follows:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Internal</strong>: These are projects that operate for the benefit and development of the unMonastery model, one example is the unMonastery in-a-box (to be announced in the coming day), which seeks to create the tools and evaluation methodology to allow anyone can replicate unMonastery in their own town or city.</li>\n\n<li><b>Interface</b>: Takes as its primary concern local integration, perhaps in the form of a more indepth social asset mapping exercise like the <a href=\"https://maps.google.it/maps/ms?ll=40.673087,16.598625&amp;spn=0.092178,0.213032&amp;t=h&amp;z=13&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=207595146999890559764.0004d893ac371ab3461cd\">map</a> developed at the first Matera co-design session, or it may include a series of convivial events designed to better bridge interaction between unMonasterians and the local population.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Outreach</strong>: For projects explicitly focused on the kind work that will be enacted outside of the unMonastery during our time there, although these projects will rely on the support of unMonastery they will aim to be autonomous in their execution.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Injection</strong>: After the first co-design session in Matera we realised there are many projects that already exist in Matera that could benefit from the resources and support of the unMonastery, this will be an opportunity for the residents of Matera to inject ideas into unMonastery that they believe to be a necessity to its success.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Actionable Outcomes:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Top 20 Challenges list and blogpost.</li>\n\n<li>Feedback on pledges submitted so far.</li>\n\n<li>The writing of the international call.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Co-Designing the Home of unMonastery: Mapping, Modelling and Designing - Part 2</h3>\n\nThis workshop will be focused on a bringing together architects, hackers and planners in Matera who put themselves forward during the first unMonastery event in March to co-design the interior and internal infrastructure of unMonastery. Focused on imaging the possibilities of the space, this workshop will also address practical mapping, defining building requirements and a detailed plan of logistical considerations for getting the building up to scratch.\n\n<strong>Actionable Outcomes:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Co-Designed plan for the building with local architects and designers</li>\n\n<li>Clearly defined requirements and practical challenges for the months ahead</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Launching the International Call for Pledges.</h3>\n\n<strong>Sunday</strong>\n\nThe last day will see the international call go live on the website and the publishing of all material created during the course of the weekend!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-05-10 12:49:35", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 05:43:14.399961", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 853, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 352, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 319, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2013-08-11 20:34:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-12 18:11:54.925350", "deleted_at": "2017-07-25 14:05:55.748191", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20010, "user_id": 3586, "topic_id": 6379, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>notes of MIT course By Prof Christopher Love - Koch institute </b>\n\nBy\u00a0Prof\u00a0Christopher Love -\u00a0Koch institute at MIT\n\nFocus on protein therapeutics manufacturing\u00a0using recombinant DNA technology.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWeek 1\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Define what a biologic drug is</li>\n\n<li>Describe why biologic drugs are important in the treatment of disease</li>\n\n<li>Summarize how cells were first used in manufacturing</li>\n\n<li>Explain why many modern biologic drugs are manufactured using cell culture</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<img id=\"en-media:image/png:4e0cc0c6f8f4a852f99e2286b7a7a17f:none:none\" src=\"evernotecid://57FBDB36-566E-4472-A998-D5FE33AFCB1A/ENResource/p125\" width=\"180\"><img id=\"en-media:image/png:ee247426798a2ad83b699b03146c608b:none:none\" src=\"evernotecid://57FBDB36-566E-4472-A998-D5FE33AFCB1A/ENResource/p130\" width=\"215\">\n\nWhat is a biologic drug?\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>biological drug (= protein therapeutic)</li>\n\n<li>vacines</li>\n\n<li>blood components</li>\n\n<li>hormones\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\nMulti billion dollar industry\n\n\u00a0<img id=\"en-media:image/png:7b6adb7a9ab9ab448d5b1d73f21868e3:none:none\" src=\"evernotecid://57FBDB36-566E-4472-A998-D5FE33AFCB1A/ENResource/p131\" width=\"338\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFirst test with penicillin:\u00a0\n\n<img id=\"en-media:image/png:6b485f429ce8b4e450fe9230df31a4fd:none:none\" src=\"evernotecid://57FBDB36-566E-4472-A998-D5FE33AFCB1A/ENResource/p132\" width=\"352\">\n\nlow yield to high yield penicillin (over 1000 fold increase)\n\n=&gt;

Although a\u00a0degree of jaundice is common in healthy newborns, early\u00a0detection of extreme jaundice is essential to prevent\u00a0permanent brain damage or death. Current detection\u00a0techniques, however, require clinical tests with blood\u00a0samples or other specialized equipment. Consequently,\u00a0newborns often depend on visual assessments of their skin\u00a0color at home, which is known to be unreliable.\n\nSketch 1 - To explain the Idea\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a5397e4a792f6cc5b5e9c105c156b9f433ecccf4.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"487\">\n\nSketch 2 - Concept Storyboard\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/103efd7d630f471a827a7ea6c2531da1218e2254.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"487\">\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-05 06:18:48", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 13:24:36.550210", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 330, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 2885.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1435, "user_id": 50, "topic_id": 1402, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The last 5 years I have been working with many projects that include working methods like\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_sourcing\" style=\"border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(221, 221, 221); color: rgb(51, 51, 51); outline-width: initial; outline-style: none; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: bold; \" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wikipedia: Crowdsourcing\">Crowdsourcing</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-creation\" style=\"border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(221, 221, 221); color: rgb(51, 51, 51); outline-width: initial; outline-style: none; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: bold; \" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wikipedia: Co-creation\">Co-creation</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdcasting\" style=\"border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(221, 221, 221); color: rgb(51, 51, 51); outline-width: initial; outline-style: none; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: bold; \" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wikipedia: Crowdcasting\">Crowdcasting</a>\u00a0in different forms.

The problem was that no pictures were sent to us. After some time of reflection we realized the problem.\u00a0The BIG challenge was to tell someone to join a project, were the output decides by the input people gives. The more input (pictures), the bigger possibility to get better output (book/exhibition). The skills you have to make that process clear and understandable defines how big possibilities you will have to get people to submit to the project.\n\n<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; \">DESCRIBING THE CORE PROCESSES</strong>\n\n<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; \"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-673\" height=\"268\" src=\"http://ideasociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/coreprocesses.jpg\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; display: block; \" title=\"coreprocesses\" width=\"322\"></strong>\n\n<div class=\"box yellow\" style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-left: 20px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: rgb(254, 255, 216); color: rgb(81, 71, 33); border-top-color: rgb(254, 222, 145); border-right-color: rgb(254, 222, 145); border-bottom-color: rgb(254, 222, 145); border-left-color: rgb(254, 222, 145); \">\n\n<strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; \"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; \">CORE PROCESSES, Eg.

People prepared to teach each other skills. Therapists to help volunteers in need of trauma support.\n\nSo,<strong> the highest-impact technologies are those that help bring people together. Share knowledge</strong>. <strong>Distribute human resources</strong> across different care contexts.\n\nThese technologies are connectors: they help string together and coordinate human efforts. At Edgeryders, we have resolved to put this lesson into practice. We are doing it by hacking the most fundamental connecting technology of all: the home.\n\n<strong>Building The Reef is where we, together, design the physical space, its financing model, and the activities therein</strong> \u2013 from business to fitness and personal development. The track is open to people who, like us, are willing to put some \u201cskin in the game\u201d by becoming Founding Members.\n\n<strong>What you get out of being a Founding Member\u00a0of the Reef\u00a0is access to\u00a0unique opportunities to develop skills and behaviours needed for living and working well with others:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Use of the coworking space and guest room (incl. public transport &amp; sim card)</li>\n\n<li>Project development &amp; partnership-building support</li>\n\n<li>Invitation to participate in Skill Development Masterclasses</li>\n\n<li>Invitation to networking dinners, parties,\u00a0and adventures</li>\n\n<li>Full unlimited access passes to our Annual Community Summits (e.g. OpenVIllage Festival)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>What you will learn</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>how to present &amp; sell your ideas</li>\n\n<li>community building and management</li>\n\n<li>intercultural communication</li>\n\n<li>resolving and limiting damage from conflicts</li>\n\n<li>building practical skills like permaculture, carpentry and plumbing</li>\n\n<li>improving nutrition and physical wellbeing\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>recognising and dealing with common psychosocial problems e.g. depression</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>What each one of us contributes</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>When becoming a member:</strong>\u00a025 Eur/month for one year to\u00a0cover\u00a0running costs.</li>\n\n<li><strong>While in the house</strong>, as resident and/or visiting: share costs of collective meals\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>On the online community platform: </strong>be generous with feedback and knowledge to support one another's work</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Our approach towards community and support-building implies trust and a spirit of generosity, rather than transactional relationships.\u00a0</strong>\n\n<strong>Members are contributors and not service recipients.</strong> This means the focus stays on accommodating each other to the best of our possibilities\u00a0in order to meet each other's needs.\u00a0If and when scheduling conflicts appear for lodging or other calendar events, we put our heads together to come up with creative solutions.\n\n<strong>Become a founding member right now!</strong>\u00a0\n\nLook at the options below, pick one and make your financial contribution. \u00a0If you pledge 300 Eur (25 Eur/month) or above your immediate benefits include:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>A spot for you and your project in the\u00a0<a href=\"/t/powerpitch-a-2-day-masterclass-on-storytelling-for-conversion-may-26-27-at-the-reef-brussels/6204\">PowerPitch Masterclass</a>, May 26-27, at The Reef, Brussels.</li>\n\n<li>A full access pass to\u00a0<a href=\"/t/openvillage/788\">OpenVillage Festival</a>, October 19-21\u00a0at The Reef, Brussels</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width: 316px;\">\u00a0</td>\n\n<td style=\"width: 383px;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\">\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width: 316px;\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/933c010e1d548d9f90755c008940f8083aae039c.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a5132c06aeb9b4cba543ed53bcdf0c4deb7c08f1.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"461\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2b3da743b8dee58d09aa5470e2b58d16af697bf3.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/422f60305181fd4c249ea2346ad00b8a2cf1d801.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cdd208bce7945e7a304aa4010a154f27c0870653.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n</td>\n\n<td style=\"width: 383px;\">\n\n<strong>Founding Members <a href=\"https://donorbox.org/reef-level2\">Pledge 300 Eur</a>/year</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYour contribution secures a spot for you and your project in one 2-day Masterclass a year like this one on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/109398799609944/\">Storytelling for Conversion</a>.\n\nYou also get invitations to Evening Talk &amp; Dinner dinners like <a href=\"/t/design-when-everybody-designs-an-evening-talk-and-dinner-on-design-for-social-innovation-with-ezio-manzini-in-brussels-on-may-8-19-00/4307\">this one</a> in which we learn about the state of the art in different fields from members of our community.\n\nAlso, you get a full access pass to our annual community summit.

Only 8 out of 40 projects will make it to the final selection: the 8 most voted ones. We have 2 months to gather as many votes as possible. If we enter the final selection, the jury will evaluate the project mainly on its business plan. \n\n<strong>So if it's about votes and business plan, who cares. </strong>Communities are not about raising votes: no solid communities ever came out of online voting processes. A project's sustainability is not only about economic indicators: many projects imploded regardless the fact they were backed up by professional business plans. \n\nSo let's forget about this competition, <strong>unless\u2026 </strong>\n\nUnless we take this as:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>a way to hack evaluation based on business plans</strong>: is sustainability only about economic indicators? Is there no other way to measure and assess a project's capacity other than quantifying foreseen unit costs and revenues in monetary transactions?</li>\n\n<li><strong>a way to build a solid, convincing and purposeful communication strategy</strong> to spread the unWord, enlarge the community and channel interest (through votes) on the project. It can become an excellent way to <a href=\"/t/theres-no-i-in-teamwork/2329\">diversify</a> the unStorytellers, to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckj-0yRY7Rw\">produce</a> more re-usable media and to back-up the prototype's launch with common knowledge (both from the locals and from the Net).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<em><span>How can one committ to</span><span> taking the lead for yet </span><span>another energy-consuming adventure if there</span><span> is no </span><span>meaningful way to go for this?</span><span> How can w</span><span>e turn this into a bonding experience for the Edgeryders community? </span></em>\n\nIn my eyes, there is only one way to go for this, and it has to make sense. Turn thecompetition's objectives (getting as many votes as we can and building a business plan), to: \n\n<ol>\n\n<li>produce purposeful knowledge</li>\n\n<li>expand social capital</li>\n\n<li>create further communication material</li>\n\n<li>back-up unMonasterians missions (and more generally the launch of the prototype)</li>\n\n<li>enhance visibility of local heroes</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<strong>From now, until the 13th of March.</strong>\n\n<strong>----------------------------------------</strong>\n\n<strong>1. PRODUCE PURPOSEFUL KNOWLEDGE </strong>\n\nWHY? We are all stretched thin. If further effort has to be put in the unMonastery, it's in order to produce useful material for the community as a whole: tools which can be used by other to replicate the unMonastery in other places, processes which strengthen the prototype's <a href=\"/t/we-are-shortlisted/2344/5\">credibility</a> in order to ensure replicability (and not scalability). If work has to be put in on a speculative basis, at least valuable knowledge has to be ensured in order to secure a meaningful engagement for the entire duration of the challenge.\n\nWHAT? A <a href=\"/t/we-are-shortlisted/2344/6\">business plan that fits</a> the unMonastery looks more like a Sustainability Plan, made of sub-themes which are useful to strengthening and replicating it, based on other measures from \u20ac to evaluate the resources needed to lead an unMonastic way of life (such as calories, kilowatts, litres of water, m2 of land, ecc.)\n\nHOW? A series of 30-minute-talks with mentors known for their knowledge and radical approach to specific themes (such as urban agriculture, waste management, water re-use): they will be live-streamed, channel interest because they produce knowledge. Each talk aims at collaboratively elaborating a chunk of the Sustainability Plan. \n\nWHO? 4/6 mentors\n\nWHEN? Each Sunday, for 4/6 times in a row (choice is on: 02/02 - 09/02 - 16/02 - 23/02 - 02/03 - 09/03)\n\n<em>This seems like something people might want to exchange votes for :-)</em>\n\n<strong>2. EXPAND SOCIAL CAPITAL</strong>\n\nWHY? Communities are not a pool for scouting votes, exploiting skills or getting quality work for free. That's a one way journey to burning social capital and burnout, tout court. However, if we stick to producing purposeful knowledge, then this can actually turn out to be a way of actually expanding social capital, growing the buzz around Edgeryders, enhancing its visibility, building new, tailored relationships. Because this is what it's all about: valuable relationships and knowledge. Building the unMonastery's Sustainability Plan becomes useful to an enlarged, global community because it aims at producing useful tools to tackle shared issues. \n\nWHAT? A pool of senior/junior mentors picked both from abroad, Italy and Matera which will lead the thematic mentoring sessions. They will be picked on the basis of their knowledge, but also because they are influencers in their respective communities and are credible relationship multipliers. \n\nHOW? Through Edgeryders.\n\nWHO? To be decided (together with the themes)\n\nWHEN? <span>Each Sunday, for 4/6 times in a row (choice is on: 02/02 - 09/02 - 16/02 - 23/02 - 02/03 - 09/03)</span>\n\n<strong>3. CREATE FURTHER COMMUNICATION MATERIAL</strong>\n\nWHY? The unMonastery has a strong yet complex narrative. It has to be pitched in different ways, to different audiences, in different languages as it progressively moves from online building to the offline dimension. ReWording the unMonastery is a process which can be part of the community engagement itself: school children or artists could be called upon to work on the narrative by using local dialect or simple images. The selected challenges have to be communicated and understood both by locals and the world: having faces, above icons, makes it more realistic. \n\nWHAT? A series of short videos of: the unMonastarians which explain their missions? Local children which explain why they want unMonastarians? Local actors which use dialect to re-word the unMonastery's narrative?\n\nHOW? Through Matera 2019\n\nWHO? To be decided \n\nWHEN? Now. Or better: yesterday :-)\n\n<strong>4. BACK-UP UNMONASTERIANS MISSIONS</strong>\n\nWHY? Although there is a <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/the-unmonasterian-s-expectation-management-primer\">clear expectation management primer</a>, the most <a href=\"/u/ritao\">precious local connecting link</a> and many other resources, backing-up our first unMonasterians with whatever they might need cannot hurt: and, once the basics are covered, what can be more useful than further knowledge and an enlarged community? \n\nWHAT? Sub-themes of the Sustainability Plan linked to unMonasterians' specific missions <span>(solar panels, wi-fi, local crops)</span>\n\nHOW? Brainstorm on mentor, organize the thematic tall (Q&amp;A), co-designing the related block in the sustainability plan\n\nWHO? unMonasterians + involved Edgeryders\n\nWHEN? Now. \n\n<strong>5. ENHANCE VISIBILITY OF LOCAL HEROES</strong>\n\nThis can be an excellent occasion to convey local knowledge on specific themes. For example, in urban agriculture <a href=\"http://community.matera-basilicata2019.it/content/orti-citt%C3%A0-orti-matera-da-qui-al-2019-e-oltre\">Mimi Coviello </a>is certainly someone to involve. Also, by engaging local <a href=\"http://www.mymovies.it/biografia/?a=130804\">actors</a> in the communication process I am positive this will fuel more energies from the community. \n\nTo be managed by Matera 2019 (it also gives visibility to local creative scene, which is definetely something that adds valued to the bidding process). \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis said, there is no work for free. At least, not on this part. The only thing I can ensure is a clear, open and secured speculative budget we all agree on. \n\nNext steps, if you are interested: \n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Step up and find your place in the process: let's build a team on this and push it forward :-)</li>\n\n<li>Evaluate the time you are willing to put in, and set a price</li>\n\n<li>Open up the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmonastery-open-budget\">open budget</a>, add a row, put in your name, role and compensation (in \u20ac)</li>\n\n<li>Let's start!</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n \n\nThere is a lot more to say, but first of all let's see if this general vision is something that attracts you!", "created_at": "2014-01-19 21:21:02", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 02:00:38.086713", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1433, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 25.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11205, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1697, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Ok will add it into the revised edition</b>\n\nThnks for feedback.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-09-06 09:03:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:04.793161", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21882, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4189, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>works :)</b>\n\nthanks!\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-10 11:03:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:01.907435", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20177], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12678, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1509, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>MA...</b>\n\nMa materialmente come si fa?

The relief teams/initiatives are usually busy managing and coordinating relief work (a friend of mine has been on the run since the earthquake) which means the time that they do the reflection is probably on buses, micros, or during phone calls sharing information/story/updates. And as much as I would love for my friend to write on the platform, and start engaging in the space, he simply does not have the time to.\n\n2. But, there are relief teams that are coming to a closure of some sort - perhaps, identifying these groups and meeting them first-hand to explain what we are trying to do would work better. I have messaged, talked to few about this and yet I think it would be a more compelling case to have a face-to-face conversation and then let them decide. The first barrier to online dialogue is it takes a while for people to get used to a new interface (if it was Facebook, I am sure there would be more users!). [Also like Matthias pointed out, we have so many of such conversations every day we meet someone who is a part of the relief team.)\n\n3. About videos/audios/transcripts/SMSs: I love the SMS idea. We can definitely give it a try. I think as far as I understand the discussion, we want first hand narrative and I completely understand why. I think we will need to work on some tasks and start spreading the word. I havent yet shared much about by involvement in this project in my own Facebook/Twitter accounts - and once we start generating some kind of activity there, it will hopefully channelize some of that into this platform.\n\n4. I slept over these comments - and I think the only way we can have dialogue online is if we are in contact update/loop about these projects ourselves. If we keep in touch with the people through Facebook, emails, and even meet, I think maybe they would be interested to post in this platform. I already see quite long updates/descriptions being posted on Facebook about such and such relief work they did. We just have to redirect some of those into this platform. (I also say this because relief teams are working on \"batches\" so they take a team, go, do their deed, and come back for a day or two - and then repeat that cycle. So maybe they will be free on those days - rest, and also reflect?\n\n5. I prefer audios for first interviews because that puts less pressure on the speaker to \"perform\" (some are natural though). We can encourage them to share videos they have taken, photos they have taken though. Maybe in one of the workshops, we can also learn/share about visual documentation and they can make their own?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-19 03:24:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:27.013736", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 503, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8462, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 4357, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Alberto, check if that's good enough;)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-16 07:59:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:48.944260", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14204, "user_id": 3247, "topic_id": 656, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>WheelMap by \"Die Sozialhelden\"</b>\n\nYou can find the map on\u00a0www.wheelmap.org.\n\nThe wheelmap is a map for wheelchair accessible places.

Many of us have needed support at one point in our lives, while moving in or out of countries, so let\u2019s shed light on what it means to really care for newcomers. How do you build a support network, in a city where you don't know anyone? Alberto made this into a personal project and experiment of co-living.

During our work at Prinzessinnengarten over the past years we learned a thing or two about how informal meetups can become spaces for mutual trust and recreation, and look forward to sharing them in the upcoming OPENandChange workshop. A preview and invitation to join the conversation before we meet: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1UatoCC\">http://bit.ly/1UatoCC</a>\n\nSome of us involved in community initiatives are wondering how to create care structures without dependency on governments or NGOs? Alex reported from Calais and testifies that self-organisation can go far in providing services in refugee camps. How do you get things done yourself? <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1MwxuBD\">http://bit.ly/1MwxuBD</a>\n\nThey say institutions are the hardest to change. Yet it seems \"evasive entrepreneurs\" work around them. When there are large uncertainties, they can serve as an educational source for policy makers, demonstrating on a smaller scale what works and what does not. Do you know someone like that? Are you involved in a disruptive project and need allies to move forward? OPENandChange is where you can meet them, start here: <a href=\"http://buff.ly/29J8ZDq\">http://buff.ly/29J8ZDq</a>\n\nThere will always be people willing to contribute in any way to the wellbeing of others, and in this story they are willing to smuggle medicine across the border.

\u00a0And are you are aware of why and what your are choosing?\n\nWhen you talk of \"local or community currencies\" it seems pretty clear that you are refering to tradable wealth currencies. \u00a0If you don't include in this \u00a0category the WIR and the business barter network currencies (niether of which are very local, but which trade in the $ billions per year), then I would guess the number of people globally actively involved in the kinds of currencies you are talking about is somewhere between 1M and 100k. \u00a0It's very hard to estimate by their local nature. \u00a0And what's success? \u00a0In my view every single one of them is a success because they are all experiments in the new expressive capacity, in the awakening to new a new empowerment. \u00a0In other's view, not so, because most such initiatives start and sputter to a quiet halt. \u00a0In my years working in this area, though, I've seen a massive jump in interest and participation as well as formation of new initiatives, which looks like an exponential curve.\n\nBut to me, these types of systems (tradable wealth) are the least interesting. \u00a0If you look at systems using the broader definition of currencies and wealth (i.e the formal systems that allow us to see and shape flows) then, the participation is global, and most humans participate in these forms of currencies without recognizing them as such. \u00a0Grades, credits and degrees, e-bay/amazon ratings, +1, Facebook \"Like\", USDA Organic &amp; Fair Trade sticker, air-line miles, buy-10-get-one-free coffee cards, postage stamps, khan academy badges, the list is endless and the participation is fully global. \u00a0 There's just one \"tiny thing\" missing, and that's the understanding that these are all forms of the same expressive capacity, and a knowledge and manifestation of the grammar and carrying infrastrucutre to embody that expressive capacity. \u00a0For some reason \"exchange\" and \"trade\" is blinding us to the greater reality of flow. \u00a0The reciprocal \"balanced\" flows of trade apply to the lowest level of wealth, but the language of flow will encompass all levels.\n\nWhere we are with all these example currencies, is in a state that would be equivalent to proto-hominids without language but having thousands of words and gestures and dances and such, all which communicate concepts in many different realms of their lives, but who yet have no realization that when they are signaling eachother during a hunt, or chanting around a fire, that they are actually doing the same kind of thing.\n\nYour question of how I measure my own sucess is really great. \u00a0If you are asking that question informally, the answer is typically in a feel for the nubmer of features I've implemented in the code recently, and the number of skype calls I've had with my colleauges, or blog posts I've written. \u00a0Formally I track the hours spent on both these arenas (coding &amp; communication), and success is currently measured in my ability to increase the absolute number of those hours. \u00a0We have also been working towards some currency definitions that will make participation more explicit in the context of our working community, and which might also track a communal sense of our experience of goodnes, truth and beauty. \u00a0Which is one place where a real measure of sucess lies.\n\nPerhaps at the deepest level my measure of sucess is about the number of possibilities that I can see and feel. \u00a0The current world-wide disaster is most apparent to me in how we are using up possibilities, and decreasing possibilities available to most of human-kind to the bare minimum: fight for survival. \u00a0This again points to why \"expressive capacity\" is so important. \u00a0Expressive capacities, both the fundamental ones, like DNA, Neurons &amp; Language, and extenders like the printing press and the Internet, allways vastly increase possibility. \u00a0Thus, I believe that our greatest need is to discover/invent the new expressive capacity, the language of flow.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs to what pays my bills, I am a coder, and have started a number of projects over the years including\u00a0<a href=\"http://glassbead.com\">glassbead.com</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://sff.onlinewritingworkshop.com\">sff.onlinewritingworkshop.com</a>, and more. \u00a0More recently I've been getting some faimly support which is allowing me to decrease hours spent on paying work and devote more to building the metacurrency infrastructure.\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>", "created_at": "2012-01-09 17:16:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:05.195521", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 813, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5004, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 4971, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I have a pleasure to announce first two speakers who will join us at the LOTE5 in Brussels.\n\n**Edgeryders, meet Omar Shehabi.** \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4587c756d6efa49ed2df94286eca1eeaadf45455.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nOmar is the founder of Palestine Works, a US-based nonprofit promoting Palestinian human development by creating high-impact knowledge transfer opportunities among Palestinian and foreign young professionals. By day, Omar serves as a legal consultant with the United Nations Relief &amp; Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). He previously served as a legal officer with UNRWA in Jerusalem, and as a legal advisor with the PLO Negotiations Affairs Department, where he counseled the Palestinian leadership on final-status negotiations with Israel and other foreign relations. He has also taught international law and human rights at Birzeit University and lectured extensively on the international law dimensions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In a previous life, Omar worked as a labor lawyer in Los Angeles and Chicago, representing labor unions, employees, and employee benefit funds. He is a graduate of George Washington University and the University of Notre Dame Law School, and is an LL.M. candidate in international law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\n**Second person is Piotr Dzia\u0142ak**\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6c692af591cfb6c2fbbf8a9e6b4d9e136381d17a.jpg\" width=\"687\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nPiotr Dzia\u0142ak likes people. He considers empathy as the most important value ever. Therefore, he is very concerned about the world, especially regarding eradicating poverty, creating peace, and mitigating Climate Change. These big challenges cannot be solved within the current socio-economical system, that\u2019s why Piotr builds an alternative way of living based on cooperation, and solidarity, not competition. This led him to become a coordinating teacher at the International Teacher Training College in the middle of nowhere in Denmark. He also works on developing teaching and learning programmes for teacher education in cooperation with One World University in Mozambique. He cooperates with different development and fundraising organisations and organises events concerning the big issues of our time. He loves his students, loves teaching, good music, traveling, making field investigations, running, watching and creating films, and apparently cannot live without history and social science. Oh, and hitchhiking is kind of awesome. Piotr has been here and there and cannot wait what tomorrow will bring!\n\nPiotr and Omar will talk about their experience in work for development - from very international and very different perspectives. More details about these meetings will follow. Meanwhile, I invite you to drop a line in the comment or send me an email natalia@edgeryders.eu - if you know the right person to join the track and present their own ideas at the conference in Brussels, it would be of great help. If you want to bring your own story and need some help developing it, I am here to help you. Stay tuned, more exciting news are around the corner!

Around the world there are people exploring the edge of our current society. They aspire to solve global societal, economic, environmental, security and energy problems threatening humanity. They care about several different issues, such as open access to knowledge; openness and transparency of government; food security; smart communities; decentralized economic architecture; free/open source software; and art.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Amazing projects demonstrate hope for the future and visions of the world which is possible when we work together. In Rome, a community makespace was set up, to create an open space for hackers, artists, social innovators to create better projects together. In Denmark, they are trying to send a man into space using open source hard- and software. In Matera a group of young activists are improving their cities by engaging inhabitants to reactivate abandoned buildings. Many people living their dreams together are changing their corner of the world, one small initiative at a time.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Video Concept</span></span>\n\n<span><span>This video will try to capture 3 different stories of people living and working on the edge. It aims to inspire the viewers. The audience has the opportunity to learn from those on the edge. Their story is being told, not just as an interesting anecdote, but as an inspiration, a call to action, and a how-to guide. What kind of futures are they building? How certain are the participants of their/their society's future? How do they prepare for other alternatives, for good or bad outcomes on the horizon? Why do they have to/choose to work outside the mainstream?</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>People all over the planet are thinking hard.. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>are experimenting with solutions.. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>and care about the most important problems humanity has. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>No matter how big the risk is to fail, </span></span>\n\n<span><span>no matter how much money they have in their pockets, </span></span>\n\n<span><span>no matter how long it takes for their governments to pay attention. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>That kind of brave, radical innovation only happens at the Edge. \u00a0</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>The video will show these bits of the future that are already being build, a glimpse into the future.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Video Format</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Storytelling through visualizations: this video will tell the story by following three projects who are already building their own future. It will aim to answer the questions: Why did you start your project? Have you encountered any struggles/obstacles/threats? How do you see the future if everyone on the planet would be empowered by projects like yours? How long is your planning horizon? How would it affect how your project if you had a 200 year perspective?</span></span>\n\n<span><span>The video format will be more classical, as it will feature at least 3 projects. The main forces behind these projects will be interviewed, their projects will be shown in action, graphics will be developed to accompany the footage. Storytelling will, thus, be pursued through original footage, graphics, texts and possible voice over. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:-8.1pt;\">\n\n<table

We contrasted Edgeryders with McKinsey (a very established consultancy), trying to work out what made Edgeryders unique. Which is funny, because if Edgeryders is anything, it\u2019s unique. What do I think McKinsey do to win a bid? Probably take everyone out for dinner at a posh restaurant. Well, for a certain audience, Edgeryders can trump that: Disco Soupe. </em>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\tHow to make sense of Care together? <em>Both at the personal and collective level, care is such a sensitive topic that touches our lives where we are most vulnerable. \u00a0The immediate challenge for OpenCare is finding appropriate and ethically sound frames of enquiry.

Hope some ideas are useful :)</em>\n\nEssentially, I have been working on free resp. low budget, mobile, compact furniture myself, just in for a truck rather than a flat. Here are some experiences and ideas from this that apply generically:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Use what you find.</strong> Obviously that's the first rule for free furniture. It can be quite interesting to combine what is available into what you need, and I use it as kind of a mental exercise at times :) For half-finished products though (tubes, boards, aluminium profiles, wood sheet material, particle board sheet material) it's simpler: collect as much as you find, deconstruct it into these half-finished parts, store them.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Use a modular construction system.</strong> I used a gridbeam-derived construction system with a 50 mm hole pattern with M8 screws (<a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/gridbeam-boxes\">see</a>), but then somebody recommended <a href=\"http://openstructures.net/\">OpenStructures</a> and now I'm migrating to this. No need to make every single measure compatible with your chosen modular construction system, just be sure to create simple parts (flat boards, L profiles etc.) in dimensions recommended by the system. Which for OpenStructures is multiples of 40 mm. This ensures that you can re-use parts for other furniture projects later.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Reconfigurable furniture.</strong> As you want to be able to use the furniture in new places, it has to adapt to new places. I have made good experiences with a hole pattern around the edges of sheet material (<a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/gridbeam-boxes\">see</a>, though I'd now do it in OpenStructures derived 80 mm distance). It's nice to be able to mount everything everywhere, like with life-sized Lego\u00ae. The big problem with just hand tools is the required precision. I got somebody to create a drilling template bar for me with industrial equipment. But else, I would not drill all the holes upfront. Just mark them, and drill them on demand by holding the parts to connect together and drilling through both.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Stack on a pallet.</strong> For mobility, choose furniture dimensions to nicely stack together on a 1200 x 800 mm <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUR-pallet\">EUR-pallet</a>. For example, I use 600 x 400 x 300 mm for most of my box-sized shelf parts. Sending a single, fully stacked EUR pallet (ca. 2 m high) with all the furniture is the cheapest way to ship bulkier cargo across Europe. Because, transport space is mostly paid by space, not weight, and goods on pallet are always cheaper.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Recommended tools.</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>power drill</li>\n\n<li>small angle grinder with 125 mm disks (use the 1 mm thin stainless steel cutting disks for cutting all metals, but be careful)</li>\n\n<li>reciprocating saw (cut along straight boards for straight cuts)</li>\n\n<li>circular hand saw (optional, but allows more precision)</li>\n\n<li>essential hand tools (the more the better, but just collect them over time \u2026)</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li><strong>Stainless steel nuts and bolts.</strong> I found a nice technique for using nuts and bolts in a flexible way: I buy mixed lots of stainless steel nuts and bolts from ebay.de (ca. 2 - 3 EUR/kg), then cut them to size with an angle grinder as needed. Since it's stainless steel, no rust problems doing so. When cutting threads, grind a 45\u00b0 chamfer to it by rotating it against a running angle grinder with thick grinding disk, so that the material is taken off, not towards the thread. After that, putting on nuts is nice as with industrial produced thread ends.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Bolts standard sizes.</strong> I made good experiences with limiting the sizes of bolts I use for furniture items to M6 and M8. It means that after buying a few of these types, you have all the types you ever need, rather than just a few types of a few more diameters.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Cardboard furniture.</strong> Cardboard furniture is nice and super low budget, except in humid environments or with very damp air (which softens the corrugated cardboard). It is in any case great for prototyping furniture.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Sandwich construction.</strong> See the sketch drawing below, showing a detail of connecting a shelfboard to one \"edge pillar\" of a shelf. I watched my Dad using this technique and thought it's nice :) Esp. nice is that you can use all kinds of too short and too thin wood material for this, as the sandwiching both makes it thicker and allows to use shorter parts.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a3370ae4b3eda82ba3700f2bb52a3b03bb28596d.png\" width=\"386\" height=\"499\">", "created_at": "2015-02-17 23:26:50", "updated_at": "2018-06-17 00:51:42.172611", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 820, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 107.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 3729], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4151, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4118, "post_number": 1, "raw": "image used courtesy of Nesta\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cff403bcc8885fd40f946256f7149fb102819eb6.png\" width=\"634\" height=\"351\"><br>\n\nHi everyone,\n\nYesterday I participated in \"Shaping the Future of Digital Social Innovation in Europe\", a conference organised by Nesta, at the European Commission in Brussels. This post is an attempt to share the main discussions that connected different areas at the intersections of technology and social innovation. It is not exhaustive but focuses on some key issues which\u00a0 social innovators, entrepreneurs, hacktivists, cultural practitioners and policymakers currently are tackling in isolation but which require more aligned efforts.\n\nIf you want to do background reading do check out:\n\n<strong>1.

Manifesto for smart citizens</strong> <a href=\"http://waag.org/nl/blog/manifesto-smart-citizens\">http://waag.org/nl/blog/manifesto-smart-citizens</a>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What was not discussed, but should have been</h3>\n\nMy own observation is that an important missing component from the discussion is in the overlap between economic viability of digital social innovation initiatives...and ownership of physical assets. James mentions ownership of the means of production, distribution and sales in <a href=\"/t/my-time-bank-meetup-experience-on-social-matching-in-alternative-marketplaces/4106\">this comment</a> on the limitations of timebanking and other p2p collaboration initiatives. But there are the broader issues of permanently affordable housing, food security, etc that affect many.\n\nAnother topic that was raised in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23digitalsi%20%40casparbowden\">twitter feeds</a> was that we need to have a discussion about privacy/security infrastructure as public goods. Why is this relevant? As an illustrative example you may want to read <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/the-worlds-email-encryption-software-relies-on-one-guy-who-is-going-broke\">this story</a> about Werner Koch and think about the implications for a minute.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What was discussed</h3>\n\nA key discussion revolved around policymakers and others placing emphasis on<em> technological innovation</em>, rather than focusing on <em>technological arbitrage</em>. Firstly, a purely engineering focus leads to the self-indulgent idea of the act of <em>making</em> as sufficient. It also contributes to mis-identification of problems through fetishisation of data and technology as \"optimisation\". But even if we restrict the discussion to one about technology there is a huge political question that is not being addressed, but has to be.\n\n<em>\"Algorithms are instructions. Not \"acts of God\". Algorithms are subjective. What are we doing about this to democratize debates?</em>\" - Renata Avila\n\nAs Caspar Bowden points out, when it comes to digital social innovation, the European Commission\u00a0assumes that Big Data and Privacy are compatible, but <a href=\"https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ninghui/papers/privacy_utility_kdd09.pdf\">recent research shows preserving the utility of data sacrifices its anonymity</a>. If you reduce everything to information rather than social (as Google does) you end in very undemocratic place. One reason being a key point made by Marleen Stikker: that <strong>data and the Algorithms that define how those data are processed, are not neutral. They are based on subjective interpretations of reality, and embed values that need to be debated on a philosophical level rather than a technical one alone</strong>. There are already indications that <a href=\"http://research.gold.ac.uk/11079/\">this view is paving the way for the erosion of civil liberties</a>\n\n<em>'Europe needs a moral &amp; intellectual re-think on if it is right to consider data a commodity'</em> - Evgeny Morozov\n\n<strong>Usman Haque made a point that the key issue we need to address in \"internet of things\" is not about discoverability (as the web was), but about entitlement.</strong> How do citizens get involved as producers of data or entitlement structures? A person is moral owner of data. How do we get citizens to decide which are the meaningful decisions to be made? Especially when you really do need digital literacy to understand the effect of algorithms on your futures.\n\nIn Edgeryders we are <a href=\"/t/stewardship-through-market-goggles/4060\">discussing</a> this issue, from a different angle: \"a massive case of market failure occurs around personal data, where people simply cannot understand the value of their personal data, and the way it aggregates to become incredibly powerful.\".\n\nOne approach proposed was to measure the costs of disenfranchisement with solutions made for us by something or someone other than ourselves. The reasoning is that If something is not measured it doesn't get factored into institutional decision making.\n\nThe big takeaway was that we have to focus on critically looking at gatekeepers of the internet<strong> as big (mostly American) data monopolies are taking over all kinds of services and locking out smaller actors in social innovation.</strong>\u00a0\n\n<em>\"Look around you-who is capturing and prepping to capture all the data points? <a class=\"twitter-hashtag pretty-link js-nav\" href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/digiSI?src=hash\"><b><strong>#digiSI</strong></b></a> needs to go beneath surface of service</em>\"<strong> @cased</strong>\n\n<em>\"As government services are outsourced to Silicon Valley, how can smaller, local SMEs build services on the data?\"</em>\n\n<em>\"The major actors can offer for nothing a service or product it took smaller actors a lot of investment to develop\" (David Cuartielles, Arduino). </em>\n\nTo address this requires us to better equip institutions with appropriate competence as the lack of smart laws leave vacuums that are filled by the rules of technology giants. It also requires us to get behind an agenda of decentralisation, public investment in distributed architectures and putting fair and open technologies at the heart of public procurement.\n\n<em>P.S<strong> If you found this post useful and would like more, let me know so I feel motivated to produce and share more of them</strong></em> :)<em> Write to</em> <strong><em>nadia@edgeryders.eu</em></strong>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-18 19:11:46", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 15:48:51.123141", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1179, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 191.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 1485, 209, 4968], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4213, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4180, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Your news and calls for collaboration</h3>\n\nIf you have news about your work you would like to share, add them in a comment below.

This possibility is available to all of us. It is a physical, a biophysical update. The effects are physical: an ongoing process, lasting from several months to many years. It can be accounted by a purely physiological mechanism. When a center, presently dormant in the average man and woman, is activated, a powerful stream of energy rises into the head, enabling (after several years) to transcend normal limits. The cerebrospinal system has to undergo a radical change. The substance which is causing this aesthetic revolution in the brain is beyond our scrutiny, and will remain for a long time to come.\n\n\u201c<em>When you succeed in triggering this process, you necessarily start a world with is totally different from our world</em>.\u201d C. C. Jung (1975)\u00a0 Jung also pointed that at a time of dissociation, such as prevailed during the Roman Empire and which prevails in our era, is simultaneously an age of death (decay) and rebirth: \"<em>When one principle reaches the height of its power, the counter principle, stirring within, contains in its darkness the germ of a new light</em>.\u201d\n\nIf someone had told me about this a few years ago, I would have burst out laughing. But one day, it hit me, and now I'm stuck with it. It won\u2019t go away. It is non-reversible. Every week, I discover more and more people experiencing the same thing. When the body goes through this \"huge update\", it becomes impossible thereafter not to believe in human evolution. It ultimately does what you described: one stops being focused on individualism (ego melts) and develops empathy and collaboration.\n\nI do not know how the \"older people\" will become involved in this shift. The people with a very strong ego would probably have difficulty experiencing this process. It could be triggered, but they would face extreme pain and very violent physical manifestations over an extended period of time. Considerable segments of the population could be affected, in the next few years. The people in whom it is most easily activated are those with especially sensitive nervous systems. Cases are popping by the hundreds, and these people do not know what is happening to them. They lack the information that could guide them and help them to grow. It took me a more than 6 months to figure out what was happening to me.\n\nMuch could be accomplished if we changed attitudes, if we changed our reaction with people experiencing this, and ultimately in society as a whole. This is not just for the person\u2019s benefit, but for all of us to understand a model of what is going on. Certainly we must no longer subject people in the midst of this process, to approaches which are at opposite poles to self-development. These people though confused and disoriented, are undergoing a process far superior to any that we know yet how to administer.\n\nA new clinical state is being defined and documented. It is a dynamic, self-directed process of mental and physical transformation, leading to a healthier and more developed state than what we usually consider normal. It has many characteristic features, which can be objectively demonstrated. A cross-cultural survey will reveal that the process is basically similar across the world, no matter the geographic area or the culture.\n\nIndividuals undergoing this transformation usually do not understand what is happening. The early stages are often marked by violent manifestations, disorientation, confusion, a lot of fear. Tragically in many of these cases, clinicians have often mistaken the process. Many of these cases have been sent to situations destructive to their development, resulting in a great loss, not only for themselves, but for society. For these cases represent a considerable creativity potential.\n\nI know it may seem hard to believe... If people like Pavlik exist, we must expect that there are probably very extreme experiences, as extreme as Pavlik, which are currently happening. Not in just an isolated case, but in many cases. This possibility should be considered.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 02:57:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.686616", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 752, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3762, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3729, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>Hi all, here is where we draft options for good healthy eating and collaboration with food providers in Matera during Lote4.

J'ai test\u00e9 moi-m\u00eame ce questionnaire, et il faut au moins une semaine pour compl\u00e9ter chaque section. Il s'agit d'un protocole extr\u00eamement rigoureux, qui exige m\u00fbres r\u00e9flexions et pr\u00e9cisions de la part des candidat(e)s.\n\n\u00c0 l'heure actuelle, le processus de la Kundalini, tel qu\u2019expliqu\u00e9 par les syst\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux et philosophiques, est incompatible avec le paradigme de la R\u00e9alit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement utilis\u00e9 par la science moderne. \u00c0 sa base, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une vision totalement diff\u00e9rente de la nature de la vie et de la relation entre la mati\u00e8re et la conscience.\n\nDans le mod\u00e8le Kundalini, le monde ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nal et la vie qui l'habite sont une \u00abprojection\u00bb de cette conscience (semblable \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont un t\u00e9l\u00e9viseur projette une image qui est diffus\u00e9e \u00e0 partir d'une source centrale). La science, d'autre part, consid\u00e8re la mati\u00e8re comme la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 fondamentale. La vie est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans ce mod\u00e8le comme une cons\u00e9quence des processus purement biologiques, et la conscience comme un simple produit de la fonction c\u00e9r\u00e9brale.\n\nDepuis sa cr\u00e9ation, la science a impos\u00e9 une limitation sur elle-m\u00eame, n\u2019\u00e9tudiant que le monde ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nal \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire ce qui peut \u00eatre mesur\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on empirique par les sens ou les instruments d'enregistrement, et v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement par l'exp\u00e9rimentation. Par cette limitation, cependant, la science s\u2019est priv\u00e9e de l'autorit\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer des d\u00e9clarations d\u00e9finitives au sujet de possibles aspects non-physiques de la cr\u00e9ation.\n\nLes scientifiques actuels croient en l'hypoth\u00e8se que l'\u00e9volution humaine est all\u00e9e aussi loin qu'elle peut aller, et que l'intellect est la seule facult\u00e9 mentale possible pour l'appr\u00e9hension de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\n\nLes th\u00e9ories g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et sp\u00e9ciales d'Albert Einstein de la relativit\u00e9 et la th\u00e9orie quantique en physique ont d\u00e9truit l'image d\u00e9terministe de l\u2019ancienne r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Ces th\u00e9ories ont \u00e9galement remis en question la nature de la mati\u00e8re.\n\nLa physique a r\u00e9cemment d\u00e9couvert que l'univers est en expansion \u00e0 un rythme sans cesse croissant. Cette th\u00e9orie fait en sorte que la notion d'une \u00e9nergie cosmique cr\u00e9atrice (d\u00e9sign\u00e9e sous le nom de Shakti), semblerait beaucoup moins \u00e9trange \u00e0 accepter.\n\nEsp\u00e9rons que de nouvelles technologies seront invent\u00e9es, dans un avenir proche, qui nous permettront de d\u00e9tecter et d'\u00e9tudier le prana, tel qu'il fonctionne dans le corps humain, et en quoi diff\u00e8rent les niveaux de prana lorsqu'un processus de Kundalini est activ\u00e9, de quelle mani\u00e8re cela s'orchestre dans le corps, quelles quantit\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires de prana sont impliqu\u00e9es dans un processus Kundalini, etc. Une telle perc\u00e9e r\u00e9volutionnera probablement notre compr\u00e9hension de la vie, et permettrait d'amener les deux visions du monde contradictoires \u00e0 se rapprocher.\n\nLa seule chose qui puisse \u00eatre mesur\u00e9e par la science \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque-ci, en ce qui concerne le processus de la Kundalini, est le d\u00e9veloppement de traits de g\u00e9nie ou de talent artistique qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas pr\u00e9sents chez un individu, avant que le processus ne commence. Les changements dans le sang ou le liquide c\u00e9phalo-rachidien, survenus quand la Kundalini se trouve dans une phase tr\u00e8s active, pourraient \u00e9galement \u00eatre d\u00e9tect\u00e9s avec la technologie actuelle. Cependant, de telles \u00e9tudes rigoureuses n'ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 entreprises.\n\nDes \u00e9tudes scientifiques sur la Kundalini contribueraient \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e que l'\u00e9volution, plut\u00f4t que d'\u00eatre purement al\u00e9atoire, poss\u00e8de un objectif pr\u00e9d\u00e9termin\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir les facult\u00e9s sup\u00e9rieures de l'esprit comme la \u00abconscience cosmique\u00bb. Le d\u00e9veloppement de ces facult\u00e9s provoquerait une r\u00e9volution dans notre compr\u00e9hension de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\n\nAu d\u00e9but du 20<sup>i\u00e8me</sup> si\u00e8cle, la th\u00e9orie d'Einstein de la relativit\u00e9 restreinte a remplac\u00e9 les lois de Newton sur le mouvement. Mais plut\u00f4t que de les invalider totalement, cela s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 un sous-ensemble d'un plus haut niveau de commande. De la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, il est \u00e0 esp\u00e9rer que la science finira par se rendre compte que la connaissance du monde physique qu\u2019elle a gagn\u00e9 est tout aussi valable dans un sch\u00e9ma de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la conscience est primordiale, mais s\u2019av\u00e8rerait pareillement un sous-ensemble d'un ordre sup\u00e9rieur.\n\nJe souhaite que d\u2019ici peu, nous parvenions \u00e0 une expansion des fronti\u00e8res de la science dans le domaine de la conscience. Lorsque cela se produira, deux visions du monde contradictoires pourront fusionner en une nouvelle vision, qui sera sup\u00e9rieure aux deux autres.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-19 03:23:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:59.033467", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 985, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9313], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6875, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4345, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Thanks to everyone who contributed to this.</b>\n\nThis visual reporting style is much useful, especially to community members interested in harvesting and summarizing online conversations.\n\nI'm thinking <a href=\"/u/fjanss\">@fjanss</a>, <a href=\"/u/ruxandracreo\">@RuxandraCreo</a>, or <a href=\"/u/mariabyck\">@mariabyck</a>\u00a0(maybe couple it with your style of video reporting).\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-29 06:58:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:40.579656", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 63, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 199], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11877, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 5427, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Thanks @trythis !\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-15 08:56:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.092503", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9901], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21472, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5227, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>\"Yes, but what will we DO?\"</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/melancon\">@melancon</a>, my friend: our text is clear and nicely written, but it is not a work program.

I make it look like a \"finely tuned social engineering\" trick - so that my intended audience (who does not enjoy digging into the detailed nuts and bolts, long lists of exceptions, etc.) can be reached. In the end it boils down to an unsupported claim on my side. If I had written out the long version (not the 5 step click-bait style) full of \"ifs\" and \"probablies\" who would have read it? I tried to break out of that circle.\n\nRe \"the math post\": Not exactly the same issue, but something in the same vain I think (survival strategies). I just thought it could be good for you to have it on the radar (if you didn't already) for a variety of reasons. No new magic. End of story.\n\nRe survival strategies:\n\nYes, in my simplified way I was saying extro = r-strategists, intro = K-strategists. But please remember that what I tried to say with simple words would have been more accurately: A group of people that shares many traits with extros also shares many aspects of their survival strategy with r-strategists, and accordingly for intros and K-strategy. An examplary dynamic would be: the introvert saying: \"I knew XY before it was cool.\", implying: \"I can read weak signals (next big thing), which is highly correlated with being an introvert. I do not have to care about other people's opinion - because I am an introvert. \"Cool\" attracts extroverts whom I don't want to mingle with because they are relatively homogeneous and I am way different from them in a desirable sense (I am special). I live in a non-competitive niche, so as long as you don't piss me off I am not threat to you. If you do piss me off (e.g. because you wan to encroach on my \"territory\" with your extrovert tactics) I can employ tactics you cannot use (e.g. because you need to stay \"cool\") to ruin your day.\"\n\nRe random: In ecological systems there is very little random about whom you find where and how they interact with each other. Humans have filled functionally different niches (as different as say a squirrel and a goose), and accordingly adopted different survival strategies. Some rely more on a group cohesion and conformism, some (especially observable during speciation) actively try to distance themselves from the middle of the road strategies (which usually come with strong competitive pressure). Thus if people are somewhat rational about their networking, they will end up in pretty different ends of the network. This probably happens very much in an \"evolution-like\" process, after many, many interactions with varying degree of \"stickiness\". Even the varying probabilities for certain consequences may not be drastically different, the large numbers of interactions that eventually guide you to your position in the network make this effect quite significant in the end.\n\nWhat I should probably stress again is that the simple click-baity recipy above is <em>not </em>a sure-fire way to build networks on the fringes. It is more an attempt / minority opinion for raising your chances from 0.001 to 0.01 (under circumstances XYZ).\n\nDoes that make things clearer or cloudier?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-27 22:37:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:18.191029", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 568, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13732], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1430, "user_id": 720, "topic_id": 1397, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi, my name is Lina, I am an architect and I am an associate of SARCHA since 2009 participating in the formulation of different research themes and projects.\n\n<a href=\"http://sarcha.gr/About.aspx\">SARCHA</a> is a not-for-profit organization founded in 2006.

She is not only a very intelligent young lady but probably also the most positive person I know. \u2018Eta Kryta\u2019 -which means in Russian \u2018this is great\u2019 - is her motto, which she uses even when things get tough, and turns these negative experiences into \u2018Eta Kryta\u2019!\n\nWith this positive attitude she also handles her social mission in Belarus; \u2018building infrastructure for people with disabilities\u2019. I believe that the almost nonexistent infrastructure for people with disabilities can be considered as is one of the biggest social problems Belarus faces. During my project \u2018SocStarter\u2019 I have met many people in Belarus who took the initiative to improve the situation for people with disabilities, for example by providing them with a job or supporting them in moving around the city. Ludmila does many things in this sphere however I would like to focus on one inspiring project of hers: \u2018tours for people with disabilities in Minsk\u2019.   \n\nBut first, let me write a bit about Ludmila\u2019s background.  After finishing her studies in Economics, Linguistic (German and English) and International marketing in Belarus and abroad she was convinced it was her time to make a difference. During her studies she discovered a niche that was underdeveloped in Belarus, namely tourism. At her work in an open-air museum, she met a girl Yulia, in whom she found an inspiration and a focus. Yulia\u2019s mother was blind and Yulia\u2019s dream was to build a museum with tactile models of the most famous buildings in Belarus. In this way everyone, including Yulia\u2019s mom, would be able to touch them and \u2018feel\u2019 them. Ludmila felt very inspired by this dream; she decided to link the tactical models of buildings with tours through Minsk.\n\nHer first action was to participate in a national festival for the best tours and tour guides.  Ludmila introduced herself as the manager of a \u2018new\u2019 branch \u2013 tours for people with special needs. This idea shocked everyone involved in the festival. Ludmila described an appointment with one of the organizers of this festival as the moment that she felt like being from another planet. She introduced something very new and unfamiliar to these people and created a little earthquake. But for sure she got their attention.\n\nSoon thereafter, Ludmila and her team organized the first tour for wheelchair users and for blind people. People in wheelchairs were afraid to show up for the excursion because they didn\u2019t believe that it could be accessible and therefore only one person showed up. However this did not interfere with the big amount of media attention the first tour ever given in Belarus for people with disabilities received. Ludmila felt that blind people were waiting for an opportunity like this to arise. The media attention came mainly from journalists who had relatives that were disabled. After the first tour many other tours followed as well as the development of the tactical models and tactical paintings. Ludmila received many letters, personal notes and emails from people describing their gratitude. This keeps her going and being motivated to do more to include these people in the Belarusian society.\n\nI have to describe the beautiful story Ludmila told me about a blind little girl who took part in one of Ludmila\u2019s tours. The little girl touched one of the tactical models of a building, started to touch the stairs of the building and went higher, touching the surface and the roof, and suddenly she screamed \u2018Waahhh\u2019, everyone around her thought something bad has happened, but the girl smiled and yelled \u2018this is so beautiful\u2019. These moments are so special and unique for Ludmila, as she understood that this girl really \u2018saw\u2019 the building for the first time.\n\nLudmila organizes these tours and other projects involving people with disabilities for free, without any financial support. She has a team of volunteers behind her that support her in achieving this.\n\nShe believes that in the near future together with her team she will open a social business that will include an information centre for everyone concentrated on people with disability. In this info centre everybody will be able to get informed about their rights, jobs and tours for people with disabilities. Everyone can visit the centre either to inform himself or herself about employing people with disabilities, or to develop in cooperation projects to improve the infrastructure for people with disabilities or just to visit an exhibition made by or about people with disabilities. \u2018Belarus has to become accessible to everyone; I will be the happiest person when people in wheelchairs are able to become directors of big companies or members of the government. But for now we have to take little steps to create an integrated Belarusian society where people in wheelchairs can get out of their houses and enter a bus without always being dependent on someone\u2019s support\u2019, Ludmila\u2019s words.\n\nI have asked Ludmila two additional questions:\n\n1. Can you name one more social innovator in Belarus that you find inspiring, this may be in any field?\n\n    [quote]I meet more and more people in Belarus that adore their jobs or the project they develop. My own team inspires me. They are the real innovators, they have different points of view, different creative ideas and they really want to invest time, knowledge and skills in something that is important for everybody \u2013 in the future.[/quote]\n\n2. Where do you want to be in two years and what do you need to achieve this?\n\n    [quote]\n    I want to open an exhibition and training center where lectures and trainings will be held for children and adult about disabilities. In this centre will be a museum exhibiting tactic models and tactic pictures and have different other exhibitions, show and events organized. We have everything already to start building this centre; we only need support in finding and financing the space. The space needs to be accessible for all, that\u2019s the main criteria!\n    Ludmila has presented her mission during TedX Minsk. Very interesting and inspiring! For English speakers: there is an option to view a translation of the Russian Subtitles.\n    [/quote]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/kplaxA6vdlw?rel=0\n\n----------\n\n## :ru: _Russian version_<a name=\"ru\"></a>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f13b7700782f553c2d0c5d09bc152bdb44d26764.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n\u042d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0431\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u044f \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u041b\u044e\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u0421\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0443\u043c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0430\u044f  \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u043e, \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e.

According to my plan, I will try to cover several major regions (Eastern part of Ukraine, with a stress on rehabilitation of the regions), Western part, Kiev, Crimea/South of Ukraine and of course some other initiatives from center/north.\u00a0\n\nSo far I was lucky to find good opportunities in town Slaviansk, which is in the Eastern part of Ukraine, very close to the conflict area. Found good initiatives that are based in Kiev, though had an all-Ukrainian effect. Had found specifically Kiev initiatives too. In the following wikis, I will share my notes from the interviews to get a little introduction on them. Each of the person/activist I have spoken to, had shown desire to register on site and share their cases, thus hopefully tomorrow, some of them will do that already. In addition, I hope to continue searching initiatives in Kiev/East areas in addition to the new on my planning list.\n\nSo here, it goes. First great all-Ukrainian initiative, that personally gave my chills the moment I have found out about them, due to preliminary knowledge on the matter, and due to great effect such practices are having.\n\nTaken from interview notes/google doc for case formation after the skype interview.

In the times of Maidan, and now after the emergence of war in Ukraine, the technique that is being used in the project: theater of oppressed. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_the_Oppressed)\n\nThe project is function for little bit more over a year, there were more than 10 performances made, couple of seminars in Kiev and other regions of Ukraine. The urge for the project has been conflict tension\u00a0on Maidan and need for psychological rehabilitation and search for ways out of the conflict\n\nThe concept of the idea: Everyone who participates are doing activities on their own time. Theater\u00a0works with ordinary people. The core of the performances are usual stories, that are either apolitical, or related to current political/social/economic problems. After discussion of the problem, the script is being formed, yet it shows only problematics and not the decisions. There is an ending to the script, but audience after watching the play can redo the ending and act an alternative version. They can offer a solution to the problem. Such practices disclose creativity in people, problem-solving, open-mindedness and openness of expression of inner thoughts, problems etc. It has therapeutic effect for the group that works with images and structures. it has rehabilitation effect and forms a dialog.\u00a0\n\nIt is used in small circles. We are a platform for\u00a0theater. in comparison with other practices this method\u00a0includes game and exercisea, it is used in this format for different purposes. The game takes us back to the game spontaneous manifestations. The theater is largely the story of people - to humanize mankind. Via this project people are contributing to the socia structure.\n\nPeople who come to the seminars, regardless of age and experience are included in the process quickly because the games are fun and they have the opportunity to open up.

On my secret last day in Matera in the wake of the LOTE#3 gathering, I finally crossed the road. Not to the inviting Murgia, but to the neighbouring monastery that will so dominate our view. In the unverifably old sub-church that forms as an invisible appendix to the XVIII Century edifice that we see daily, my path finally crossed those of our predecessors\u2026 How does our unWorship witness theirs? The XVI Century social organs that erected these monuments reflected a spiritual currency. At the top, the ecclesiastical aristocrats who dispersed it commissioned frescos left, right and centre; beneath them slaved the waves of worker nuns and monks who kept the operation churning. Responsible for maintaining an atmosphere of religious fever and aided by generous amounts of sleep deprivation and chronic sonorous head vibration induced by all that chanting, they staggered about in sufficient perpetual euphoric rapture to keep the entire community convinced of their do-gooding.\n\nOur version of the unHolier than thou, while it must seek this rapture, cannot afford to take shortcuts. The Rigours of the unMonastery Life in the unMonastery offers a cross between an artistic residency and a spiritual retreat. Our progression towards one-size-fits-all praecepta vitalia (vital precepts) has not yet reached its conclusion; the collective journey towards this wisdom shall in itself become a source of valuable knowledge.\n\nWhile the constraints of establishing our Matera prototype require that these precepts evolve at an inorganic pace, drawing copiously upon both historical monastic practice and the traditions of squatters, can initially inform our life rhythms and decision making processes. In choice of diet, interactive patterns and work load, we shall perhaps approach the model of self-development disciplines. Only, our development is of the collective self. Aspects of our individual programming shall inevitably be dropped at the door. Work is to be done.\n\nBeyond designing a re-fit for urban geeks who haven\u2019t yet succumbed to their gluten intolerance, the unMonastery is a service organ. We shall survive by creating inviting rhythms and rituals that allow us to embrace a life of devotion in the face of a crumbling game. Our medium must be internal human warmth. We seek to build a regime of personal acceptance and confrontation with a generous proportion of collective triumph augmented by sensual feedback. Through communion with our deepest nature \u2013 the dance, and most excellent food shall be our currency of conversion. Our vow of silence may become a periodic vow of non-verbalism.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Alternative Cycles \u2013 Periodic Regulation</h2>\n\nWomen who share the same roof often co-ordinate their ovation cycles. It remains to be seen whether the creative powers of fellow unMonasterians will similarily coordinate to one another and to that of the moon. While we shall observe the passing of each lunar cycle, our work week shall absorb the administrative rhythm of our host societies. Life will be organised in cycles two weeks culminating in our legendary thematic open door rites of celebration.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Sleeping regime</h2>\n\nWhile we recognise that certain orders evolved the form of the solitary cell, we know that in many traditional societies operate with collective sleeping rooms. Many of us have grown up sleeping alone in a single room for long periods of time. To some this is beyond a luxury. A community of Indian social workers once expressed dismay at the Northern practice of giving children their individual room: What have they done wrong? what form of punishment can this be? Traditionally monasteries achieve a purity of purpose via some form of sleep deprivation.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Dietary regime</h2>\n\nRestricted as we are to a diet of ultra healthy regional produce, malnutrition cannot be seen as an immediate problem. However, many novices and supplicants have reported to not own their own bloodstream. A transitional, rigorous cleansing period of up to two weeks is proposed. This seems a particular adjustment for those from colder climes who may need to adjust both their sleeping patterns and digestive tracts.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-23 05:44:22", "updated_at": "2017-10-28 01:01:51.240829", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 770, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2833, "user_id": 61, "topic_id": 2800, "post_number": 1, "raw": "(buried in the archives was an indication that the resident understanding did not always reach into resident practice...)\n\nBilingualism isn\u2019t easy.  Once one has acquired a certain grace, and in a forgiving climate, it may only periodically provoke symptoms of schizophrenia.  However, there exists an enormous grey zone between acquiring a few meager all-purpose defensive phrases, and the death-defying leap required to successfully employ them.\n\nPeople vary.  Having once survived a linguistic transplant may provide one sufficient faith with which to successfully negotiate the process a third or fourth time; still it is also possible to harbour the opposite allergic reaction of \u2018never again\u2019.  Those whose personal history has never forced them into the position of a linguistic minority may find it particularly naked to embrace the pleasure.\n\nUnMonasterians are dependent upon nuanced, intricate communication with their host communities.  Some things can go through the filter of translators, some cracks can be circumvented via significant ritual.  Goodwill goes a long way.   However, to augment our capacity to have an effective presence in the field, every technique to build our linguistic proficiency should be incorporated into our daily practice.\n\nThe Materan flagship prototype quickly confronted exactly this dilemma; a mixture of uniphones, polyglots, native speakers and the chronically stubborn stood perched on the outer rim of effective public education with a thankless task.  In our practical reality, the mental gymnastics to absorb and actify Italian had to occur as we hit the beach.  The truncated projected presence for a mere four months was inhuman at best.  Lacking the resources of the KGB to bombard the unMonks with the hyper-learning techniques employing hypnosis, sleep deprivation, somatic feedback mechanisms and God knows what else, we were more or less up to our own initiative\u2026\n\nThe latest contribution to language acquisition is the free net-based services set up by benevolence entities such as the EU.  A few hardy souls ventured out into the wilds of Duolingo to expose themselves to a scattering of rudimentary elements.  It is useful enough to increase familiarity with basics, but even when amplified by its in-built system of compete with your friends, it hardly provides a hands-on deep learning experience.\n\nOur early duties at the unMo had to do with other survival skills.  Shivering was a universal that didn\u2019t require an interpreter.  Eating was largely preverbal; recurring spells of \u2018excommunication\u2019 (unMo-speak for prolonged internet disconnectivity) left us virtually speechless.  If civilized conversation was indeed indulged in, it was largely saved for cursing the Gods.  When we finally opened our mouths it was to invoke a \u2018No Complaining\u2019 clause that forced us to shut them again.  The temptation to exist in a cloud of flawed or over-verbose English was irresistible.\n\nTo prime the transition to an active bilingual lifestyle, a subtle Italiano component was inserted into the finale of our early morning physical practice.  After loosening limb and fantasy in the most dramatic of circumstances on the unMonastery\u2019s impressive walled terrace that jutted out over the rim of Matera\u2019s fabled ravine, a core text of semi-practical phrases was introduced.  The non-Credo of the non-Monastery was pure indoctrination.  Used to both break our sound barrier, and to broadcast our ideological fundamentals, it stretched our ears and tongues over the rack of our individual helplessness.   According to plan: the unMonks, force fed foreign sounds and poetry, would soon become hungry for more.  In practice it was just plain torture\u2026\n\nIl non-Credo delle non-Monache \n\nAncor non lo sappiamo,\n\nnel frattempo lasciateci perdere.\n\nAffronta i tuoi errori faccia a faccia:\n\nI sacri muri preserveranno a nostra onest\u00e0.\n\nIl nostro duro lavoro sar\u00e1 tanto leggendario quanto i nostri baccanali.\n\nCi domandiamo di cosa i giusti godranno a cena\u2026 ?\n\n(my rough translation)\n\n\u201cStill we don\u2019t understand, but in the meantime shall \u2018Get Lost\u2019.\n\nConfront your mistakes, face to face -\n\nthe Sacred Walls shall preserve our honesty.\n\nOur hard work shall be as legendary as our Bacchanalia.\n\nWe wonder what the good people shall enjoy for dinner\u2026 ?\u201d\n\nHaving \u2018mastered\u2019 the above liturgical component, we shared it with the assembled multitudes attending our inaugural press conference who gleefully chanted along with us.

See the update at the end of the post!\n\nThis is the unfinished story of our little startup company. Just as real life, it's pretty chaotic. And it's a story about how the EU nearly helped us get that company going, but in the end ... well, read for yourself.\n\n<strong>Finding a business idea.</strong> We're roughly at the brink of 2010. I had been self-employed for two years by then as an IT freelancer, and by then had seen all the precarious work and exploitation going on in that area. And I didn't want to proceed writing fixed-price offers for developing software that the customer had no real idea of yet ... . So I talked with a friend of mine who felt likewise, and we agreed that, in adsence of vitamin C contacts to big business for getting better contract work, developing an own product would be the only option to sustain the freedom of self-employment yet start earning some bucks ... . We also agreed that, where money flows, you can grab some money (... urgh ... not my style of thinking normally and it hurts my open source soul to write that but, you know, these \"economic necessities\" in the system that we have). So we wanted to do something about trade. The innovative portion came in when I had to repair a digital camera for another friend at that time, and found it quite easy and fun to do, and spare parts were also cheap by buying other defective items. So the initial part was that we set up a site that bought defective cameras from all over Germany, and could immediately hand out prices for all the different models. We later extended that \"remanufacturing business\" idea to other kinds of electronics, and not just defective items but also all unused / old ones, and currently work on another extension of the idea (which I cannot disclose until its launch ...). But the basic idea stayed the same. And with respect to money, our initial experiments were promising enough to keep us on that path ... . However, IT development work beyond that prototype turned out to be quite much, and we had to see how to support ourselves while completing that development:\n\n<strong>EXIST?</strong> Working in the daily electronics remanufacturing to earn our bucks and at the same time doing programming for improving our prototypical software proved to be quite too much, and we made slow progress. And by the start of next year (2011) we were in contact with two young guys, one a MBA person just finishing studies, the other a young graphics designer, who were interested in joining our entrepeneuring startup. That was good luck, as our MBA person was already in contact with an entrepeneurship support cluster and also a professor from university who was eager to support startups done by students. The entrepeneurship cluster offered help to develop a business plan that would get accepted for an <a href=\"http://www.exist.de/englische_version/index.php\">EXIST</a> business startup grant, co-financed by Germany and the European Social Fund. So we had initial meetings to figure out our exact business strategy and such. and it looked all quite promising.\n\n<strong>Real life cuts in.</strong> But things are not always smooth in life. The MBA guy in our 4-person team finished university successfully and decided to move from Munich to our area for being full-time member in this startup and to write the business plan for EXIST. But then shortly after, his girlfriend finished the relationship and he was ... devastated. No longer capable or motivated for the risks and workload of a business startup. We did of course allow for the retreat, but together with that our chances to get a EXIST grant went to zero. As we no longer met their \"at least two founders with a university degree no longer than 5 years back\" requirement. In addition, my own computer science degree was maturing to be 5 years back in summer 2011, so we even had no time to find a replacement for our MBA person (finding business partners for yearlong co-working really takes time ...).\n\n<strong>Three F funding.</strong> We're still proceeding with this startup, and since two or three months are always just two weeks before the release of our new and shiny, innovative recommerce platform :) However, without the 100k EUR EXIST grant, it has been a hard ride. Funded by the 3F: family, friends and fools. (And ourselves of course.) We're grateful for the support and for being still in business, but it's all quite the limit of what you can fund for by private means and we can't go on like that much longer. But put another way round, there are times where your startup has proceeded beyong the point of no return. I certainly do not want to have wasted 2 years of life on a business idea that I abandoned just before going to the market ...\n\n<strong>Note to entrepeneur funds.</strong> Funding programs like EXIST are great, but as in our case, too rigid to be a help to any but the most lucky startups. Read a good book on web startups or the like, and they show how a startup is about <em>developing</em> the very business idea in some area, by doing experiments and pivoting as required. We have changed our idea how to make money in recommerce like 5 times (I shortened it up above ...). And then you're required to write some business plan with numbers what to earn in what year ... it's simply some old-school nonsense, not for the networked age where a startup mostly pioneers a market in some way. And on top, there are these rigid requirements (see above, finally blocking us) and at the other side these rigid grant model setups. (On a side note, we also were not eligible for another, smaller German entrepeneur support program informally called Ich-AG because we had been registered as self-employed <em>before</em> getting on the idea to do this startup together ... sigh.) What I'd like to see is a group of experienced mentors who are eligible to distribute some funds to startups at will and as they see fit; with peer review against corruption and all, but distinct from the rigid support models that failed to support us.\n\nWish us good luck, we're going online in ... two weeks ;-)\n\n<h3><strong>Update 2012-09-03</strong></h3>Thought I'd let you all know some good news about our little startup's progress: we're really really online now :-) Our product description page is this\u00a0 (in German):\n\n<a href=\"https://www.mintybox.com/merchants/register\">mintybox.com/merchants/register</a>\n\nOnly for the German market initially, sry for the language barrier. So here's our idea in a nutshell: while there are many buy-in sites for used stuff already, like for example, <a href=\"http://www.gazelle.com/\">gazelle.com</a>, these are always larger companies which develop their own product catalog and software for the buy-in process. Our new approach instead is to provide that buy-in software as a product to a multitude of independent, new remanufacturing companies. Which could be really small, like a student wanting a side income, or people working from their homes. Like the one we operated ourselves before focusing on the software.\n\nAs far as I can see, a network of small independent businesses is quite typical for how Edgeryders folks would organize the economy if they had a say on it. And it's not by chance that we chose such a strategy for our startup, rather than trying to become a big(ger) remanufacturer with employees ourselves. Personally I much dislike the employee role, so I don't want to give others that treatment either ...\n\nAs always, feedback welcome: Do you think ours is a viable approach to tackle the problem of financial independence for us, and for those who use our product to become self-employed? And, how does it all fit into the context of difficult / insecure economic times like these?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 17:12:57", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 04:46:50.406301", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1428, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28699, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3883, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>privacy</b>\n\nI would leave it to the person or persons themselves if and how they want to describe their own inner experience.

I guess I dont want to make that distinction. and yet these last days I have put 'my' life on hold. And yet, yes, I am human, and will to stay that way, and so I'll be off for a couple of days looking after people who need me 'for real'. But beforehand I have to address a few things...\n\nFor the last few days my head has been buried in, among other things, a call for proposals to see if theres a fit for a possible next phase of edgeryder development.\n\nI agree with you wholeheartedly, narky and all as I may get at times. There are a lot of us here and there are many ideas as to what the direction and why. I tend to be pretty focussed on what I am looking at at any one time, whether that be broad or narrow scope, for the last few days its been pretty narrow and so now I should explain, which I hope I can do without offending anyone. \n\nYou asked about the *objectives* of local interaction and localised groups. I am always thinking 'accomodation' as in facilitation, how can we make one thing out of a tool and a process, so that the process becomes the tool. So far ER has been about policy informing, but that phase is done it seems, at least in the passive format, this much is clear. Funnily its not from the ER perspective I say this, but from the perspective of the European Commission as voiced in their last call for proposals on the Progress program. They are using this call to initiate a new kind of process that is active participatory policy intervention and experimentation. In other words, they are offering to fund partnerships between governmental authorities- from local through regional councils, to national scale- to take policies and tinker with them, hack them , if you will, but according to a strictly measurable methodology. The aim is to allow these governmental authorities a financial cushion, a safe zone, in which to try out new ways of doing things in an active and participative way, and so test new ideas, get informed about what works and what doesnt and scale positive solutions.\n\nSo that was my narrow focus...you know the way it is sometimes, you are so close to something that you mistake the part for the whole...In the thick of doing the various things I am currently consumed by doing (by no means just ER) I have needed to be very conscious of the parts, and you are speaking at the level of the whole. \n\nSo I am off to look after my beautiful and infinitely loving girlfriend , as she has just been through a rough patch of a day, with lots changing, and when \n\nI get back, before I tune into narrow again, I will address the big picture.

Si \"penser\" veut dire r\u00e9gler des probl\u00e8mes, trouver des solutions in\u00e9dites, alors tous les vivants, animaux ou v\u00e9g\u00e9taux, pensent. Si \"penser\" d\u00e9signe l'activit\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifique de r\u00e9organiser l'environnement et ses faits pour les rendre utilisables et viables, alors tous les vivants, animaux ou v\u00e9g\u00e9taux, pensent, car tous nous r\u00e9organisons l'existant pour pouvoir vivre, trouver nos ressources, prosp\u00e9rer de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res. C'est pour ces raisons que le philosophe a \u00e9crit que l'Homme est un animal pensant sans se rendre compte que cette sorte de \"penser\" est une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du vivant.\u00a0C'est pourquoi aussi la nouveaut\u00e9, conception du nouveau, est une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du vivant.\n\nIl semble que nous ayons besoin r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement de concevoir \u00e0 nouveau nos fa\u00e7ons de faire pour ces deux \"penser\" que je viens de d\u00e9crire, pour la bonne raison que les conditions changeant, les moyens d'action pour ces \"penser\" doivent s'adapter \u00e0 ces changements. Alors les philosophies peuvent \u00eatre utiles \u00e0 qui peut les traduire en principes d'action, de r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement, de process pour trouver des solutions.\u00a0\n\nLeur utilit\u00e9 tient au fait que la plupart des philosophies sont des constructions exp\u00e9rimentales, des modes d'organisation, des descriptions, des g\u00e9om\u00e9tries, de mondes \u00e0 venir, mondes possibles ou impossibles. Poour cela lisons Daniel Parrochia \"La Raison syst\u00e9matique\". L'impossibilit\u00e9 de ces philosophies tient dans la possibilit\u00e9 de leur application, c'est-\u00e0-dire de transformation de l'existant, de mani\u00e8re viable. A l'horizon, il faut bien que l'humain puisse vivre.\n\nPhilosopher est par contre un m\u00e9tier, m\u00e9tier de constructeur, d'explorateur. Cela s'apprend, mais pas vraiment \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9. Un jour vous savez que vous \u00eates devenu un philosophie et vous savez distinguer ce qui est philosophies de ce qui ne l'est pas, quel que soit le titre de l'auteur.\n\nPar exemple, l'une des constructions philosophiques actuelles, est la philosophie non-standard dont l'une des applications possibles est la mod\u00e9lisation non-standard. Qu'est-ce que cela signifie?\n\nOn a l'habitude de mod\u00e9liser un existant en le \"recouvrant\" par des connaissances. La mod\u00e9lisation non-standard tient un discours diff\u00e9rent. Tiens, il y a un truc que nous d\u00e9signons comme ... (par un exemple un poisson transg\u00e9nique\". Mais, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 nous ne savons pas si ce truc existe. Qu'est-ce qu'il nous faudrait conna\u00eetre pour que \u00e7a existe? Alors on voit que le \"truc\" est un construit et non quelque chose qui existe par avance. Si l'on tenant \u00e0 ce que ce poisson transg\u00e9nique existe par avance, alors on apporte juste les connaissances qu'on croit utiles. S'il doit \u00eatre une construction, chacun va porter les connaissances les meilleures pour faire exister ce \"truc\".\n\nPour l'histoire du poisosn trang\u00e9nique:\u00a0http://www.jouy.inra.fr/ressources_scientifiques/experimentation_animale/anibiomed_modeles_animaux_et_recherche_biomedicale/dogmatis\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-10 11:37:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:21.421446", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 497, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27996, "user_id": 398, "topic_id": 1671, "post_number": 30, "raw": "<b>Here is an initiatory mail on a project with our youth cafe...</b>\n\nMark, this is Eimhin, and Lisa is on here too, I hear you spent some time together recently and never managed to talk about the Birr youth project we are involved in.  So let's fill you in on what is happening right now. At the mo we have a space that is well kitted out, still needs some tech in there but it is ready for anything and we can look after all that end of things here. Lisa started this initiative in response to the recurrent issue of youth suicide in Birr, we know the territory being from around here, the kids are still listening to all those tunes, and more besides, and it's the same spaces and teachers and lifestyle that we have at least some experience of.\n\nWe got OEB funding from the county enterprise board on the basis of funds we raised, 12000 and thus paid the renovation on the building. Unfortunately Foroige got the scrubby little mits in on the deal and we have been lumped in with their unproductive policies and direction, this is very limiting as currently they hold the talking stick in terms of established organization. We need to basically subsume that stance by aligning with' in their eyes, 'the daddy' ie Europe, this will effectively substantiate a position that will enable the type of activities I am about to propose.\n\n- just to mention an explanatory quote from the Foroige chief we work with, he said directly to Lisa \"Basically Lisa, it's like this, you have paid for our new sitting room and now we have to let you sit in it sometimes.\" this is what we are dealing with. Also I aligned a project to make an online resource connecting youth cafes nationwide to facilitate connective self organization among the youth themselves via group specifically designed social media, and it would have been free, and this guys response was as follows: \" We wouldn't want to give the wrong kind of people access to children\" to late for that apparently, it serves to mention here that Foroige are the left hand of the RCC in Irish youth organizations, typical!\n\nSo at the moment the project has been gifted \u20ac4000 and has a portion of that to use in some way complementary to the mission of the gifting group, a suicide awareness and prevention setup. (Lisa if you could send on a mail and phone number for these people that would be very welcome) The heart is in the right place as regards their mission, but the application they want to use is pretty far off the point. In their view they want to send out leaflets and put stickers all over town, but , even if this is not directly mentioning the word, it still draws out the conscious reality of the issue and so by doing this we have a similar situation to what happens when anti-fascism actually creates facism, jung's enantiodromia, a things completion by its opposite, like 'don't think about a blue elephant'. What Could be a better idea is to instead organise a day where we have a speaker in detailing the issue and host a public address with complementary activities to attract a diverse audience, we can effectively partner with different local groups and send direct invitations to the chamber of commerce, the relative political representatives , the organizations relevant, the community itself, the parents council of the school and teachers and representatives and general members from the community also. \n\nWe have contacted the Ted Wish winner JR and the Inside Out Project and have shared our story, they are very interested to help us do this work, this project is amazing and can give cheap but powerfully impact full  material for the public consciousness in Birr to get the people thinking before, during and after the initialising event. In short massive posters of the faces of people  directly affected by familial loss through suicide. These pictures are black and white, we have spaces already assigned around the town and can flesh this out further later. The inside out project is an international arts project run by J R and his team to bring the inner experiences of communities to the surface so they can be dealt with. \n\nAnd so the event could go like this, one Saturday of a bank holiday weekend schedule the event in a hotel in Birr, hopefully in kind. Have the posters already up in town for at least a week,  have copies mounted in the ballroom hall during the event also. A few friends owe me some favours in the circus world and so there can be some workshops going on for kids, plus with nick and legitimate bodies we can work in the dance aspect. The keynote speaker will be someone from the background of the psychology of suicide, top notch no messing, I think I know just the professor. His task is to form the basis for informed discourse among the participants. The people from the photos should also be present and if they are willing should offer to facilitate public engagement as a group to reflect on how the talk reflects with their experience, how others can recognise the process in others, and in helping them come to terms with their own loss and the processes involved. \n\n. \n\nAt this event there should be, by virtue of foundations laid already, a presentation of a model to generate public funding to partner withthe EU social fund in generating a project to do two things, sustain the youth cafe network in the country, its services and to establish excellence through the feedback mechanisms in place there, and should set the scene for summer use of school buildings to attract learners ( as opposed to educators) to share their learning either live or through tech enabled media with self selecting learners attending these summer events. There are countless studies proving that young people who do not have learning experiences in the summer months are at a severe disadvatnage to those whose parents can afford it. Everyone needs places for their children to be in a safe learning environment, especially in the summer, plus this centralisation of activity to a location establishes value flows that the community can benefit from in multiple ways, teaching organic gardening, hands on learning, nutrition, physico-spiritual practices etc This serves to engage the community in a collective learning experience.\n\nThe key is the contrast, teachers and curriculum in the school year, self selected learning in the summer, DIY learning experiences built on community engagement amidst a landscape that needs these kind of processes in order to engage and communicate intercommunity dialogue.\n\nIt's one shape of a solution to some of theses problems anyway.

Quite naturally, people we talk about it with (social innovators, activists, civil servants, and more) tend to perceive one of the layer as the dominant one, according to what it is they are interested in: and that is cool, because they perceive its usefulness and can see themselves using it. But the truth is, the project would not stand without both.\n\nLayer number one is a<strong> gamified peer-to-peer learning platform</strong>. It works like this: people are asked to share their experiences as they try to build a full, rewarding, successful life in a society that seems to have no place for the young. Some people are busy inventing a new job (like my friends at <a href=\"http://www.criticalcity.org\">CriticalCity</a> in the video above), or finding an existing one in a creative way; others are experimenting with new ways of life, like sharing resources (from your couch to your car) or going out to live off the beaten track; others still are building new way to meaningful activism, making their voice heard and matter. Almost no one can do all of these things at once: even the brightest, most successful of us has more to learn than she or he has to teach. We are building a respectful, result-oriented, fact-oriented environment where we can all learn from each other. Elements borrowed from gaming should help us making this process smooth, easy and fun. The expected results for Edgeryders are learning new strategies to survive and thrive in an unfavourable context; and getting to meet and network with other European trailblazers.\n\nLayer number two is a <strong>massively collaborative, distributed policy think tank</strong>. It works like this: survival and strategies put in place by young people are shared and validated through the conversation (\"Great, I want to do that too!\" or \"A friend of mine has been tryng something similar, but...\"). At this point, we go out and try to identify the conditions that enable (or, viceversa, prevent) these strategies to be successful; then we ask European institutions to consider making policy to put these conditions in place if they are not there, and strengthen them if they are. The idea is to broaden the window of opportunity: a lot of young people are extremely successful in building new and interesting paths, but things tend to be harder than would be reasonable, and certainly harder than it was for the previous generation. Maybe, with enabling policy, more or even all of us can make a successful transition. We are convinced that, if looked at from the right angle, all of these different strategies, all of these hyper-creative things that young people are doing across the world will reveal their nature\n\n", "created_at": "2011-09-22 07:38:37", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 15:02:38.336970", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 508, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18057, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2715, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Hold it</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/kei\">@Kei</a>\u00a0no one speaks of altering anything.

Me, I wonder what happens when you pull out \u2013 which, as I write, is fairly soon: end of May as per our standing agreements, end of July if our extension proposal is accepted. David's time horizon is a bit longer: bringing the VA or other Edgeryders project to Matera in 2014 is probably in MT2019's best interest, and could also be in our (Edgeryders) own best interest. If you have more ideas and \"meat\" to bring to the Matera table, we are listening; the more the merrier.\n\nMore generally, I would not be so dismissive of talks of integration.\u00a0The reason why you guys are in Matera at all is because of an integration move, made by yours truly, between an existing client with their own agenda and the unMonastery idea being floated within the community. So far this strategy worked, because integration typically buys you efficiency. Efficiency concerns may still be overridden by other considerations, and this seems to be the case here, but it is these other consideration that need to be justified. The default is that what makes \"perfect sense from an operational perspective\"\u00a0gets done \u2013 the gods know we all are stretched thin.\u00a0\n\nFinally \u2013 and, for me, critically \u2013 no one should be forced to work in a way that he or she can't agree with. If you can't work with David, or anyone else, don't, nobody will insist you do. However, remember: the same applies to me, and here I have to draw a line. If you guys question my right to think aloud and make (intellectually honest) proposals by whatever channel I choose to, I have no choice but to disengage from the process altogether, because this is the only way I know how to function.

And how come that trauma - such a heavy word, such a serious matter - is your passion?' That is what people ask me when they hear about <a href=\"/t/trauma-tour/707\">my tour,</a> about me and my bus traveling through Europe to talk and teach about trauma and to try to soften the pain of trauma. 'No, I am not on a mission (that is a far too 'religious word for me to befriend with) - and yes, trauma is my passion, and I do have a message.\n\nI really believe that pain should come in the open. That it should be de-tabooed: we should know more about it, understand better what traumatic pain is, how it functions, how it takes possession of us, we should be able to look at it more closely, to be with it (for a while). Trauma, pain, fear ... we'd rather not experience it or watch it happen in someone else's life. It is like with 'death': we know it is part of our lives, we all have to deal with it, and yet we don't - because it's (too) uncomfortable. How to talk about human mistreatments, heavy physical pain, profound disrespect of your person, or situations where you felt like if your life was in danger? How to share the feelings of loneliness and hopelessness that go with such pain? We often do not know how to do that, and try to ban painful events and feelings from our minds, we want to forget about it.\n\nIt is something in pain itself too. We're hardwired to avoid and suppress pain. It helps us survive, it helps us to go on. Avoiding, minimizing and denying pain is our most natural, short term solution to deal with pain. It is a survival mechanism. It often takes a while, from seconds to minutes, to physically feel the pain caused by an accident, a car crash or a broken leg. Not feeling the pain gives us more time to save ourselves, to get away from danger.  Out of the car, walk away and call the ambulance f.ex. On the long term, however, not feeling isn\u2019t very effective. Because it is impossible to heal from something we don't acknowledge. On the long term, suppressed pain comes back to us, like a boomerang. That is what trauma and traumatic pain is about: it is pain that doesn't seems to go away, pain that stays with us far too long, as a residue of what happened to us.\n\nI believe that this residual pain needs to be addressed more openly.  \n\nTraumatic pain can be softened - and it should be. Because unresolved trauma makes us sick, depressed and heavy-hearted. It deregulates us, deeply and on many levels: mind, heart and body. We know that traumatic pain lies at the heart of most contemporary diseases, be they mental or physical, we know that trauma adds to almost every sickness as a major contributing factor. And yet ... the knowledge about trauma and how to address it to lower its dramatic impact on our lives is far from common.\n\nThat is what my tour is about: I want the world to be trauma-informed.\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/184185350?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\n\nI want people to come and look at the pictures on the bus and ask questions. I want them to learn about trauma and realize that healing is possible. We can all learn best practices regarding talking and coping. We can all learn to calm down and regulate a body in fight, flight or freeze modus. We can all learn techniques to stop nightmares and flashbacks. We can all learn to help traumatized persons recover. It often takes not more than 15 minutes to help people sleep better: help them release tension before they go to bed, by offering a relaxing breathing exercise, or teach them to intervene in their dreams by using their imagination, by rehearsing a different ending for their nightmare f.ex.\n\nWe are all on a mission: to a certain degree we all need to become trauma specialists. First, we need to deal with our own trauma's and those of the people around us. We need to dare to feel and face our pain instead of running away from it. Second, there's too much suffering in the world as to leave its resolution to the clinical field or therapeutic setting. Therapeutic knowledge should be accessible to all of us, it should not be protected and copyrighted. Therapeutic knowledge should be alive in the world, not only in shrinks\u2019 offices. That is why I do what I do: share my knowledge about trauma with you, share insights, methods and techniques from the field of trauma healing ... so that we can all, together, ease and soften the pain in our world.  \n\nI don\u2019t know of any other projects sharing therapeutic knowledge in the way <a href=\"http://www.traumatour.eu\">Trauma Tour</a> does. But the idea of a trauma-informed world is related to a growing field of \u2018self care\u2019: taking responsibility for one's own (mental) health by reading self help books, attending self help groups, becoming experience experts, \u2026 It is long known that helping on this \u2018equal\u2019 level, is often more effective than any method or technique. It is also known that the relationship between \u2018therapist\u2019 and \u2018patient\u2019 is a major factor when it comes to healing. If we combine both, \u2018helping expertise\u2019 and \u2018being equal\u2019, it seems a very natural thing to come out of our offices and share therapeutic knowledge with those who suffer. It makes \u2018us\u2019 helpers and \u2018them\u2019 traumatized people equal human beings, fellow human beings. It restores humanity.\n\nI\u2019m now in the middle of planning my first big tour: driving down the Balkan route and visit Greece in December 2016 / January 2017.

A group of meditation radiates peace into the world. \"Twelve published research studies have now shown that, ripples of orderliness and harmony radiate outward from this concentrated group of meditation experts.

It wouldn't necessarily have to be champion meditants engaged for such an experiment.

The ReWiG M\u00fcnchen for example is a cooperative based on the above linked concept - and we're currently about one year behind where we originally wanted to be, despite now having about 100 members, about 20 of which are more or less really active. But the good news is, we're glad to support other initiatives with the know-how and official papers which we have accumulated on the way, so that others can have things go easier and quicker.\n\nPlease note that the concept is intended to be very flexible and all neccessary modifications for a local situation are welcome. If the local solution is still (within a large tolerance) close enough to the concept to be called a ReWiG, then the ReWiG M\u00fcnchen, which has patented the word ReWiG, will gladly concent to people using it. This in turn will qualify the initiative to participate in the \"Rat der ReWiGs\" Verband, where continuing exchange of experience and mutual support will be available.\n\nAs an example of flexibilty I mention the second ReWiG: ReWiG Schlehdorf eG. They are not yet planning to invest in local businesses nor to start a local currency - rather they are taking over an existing ecological farm which also offers nature experience for young people. But they have their hearts in the right place and they have founded a cooperative, and we're glad to support them and grant the right to the name ReWiG. In a similar way I could well imagine a ReWiG in Leipzig initially dedicated to getting the projects you're looking at instantiated, and at the same time being part of a movement could help (a) getting started, and (b) to expand horizons and take up further possible aspects of a ReWiG in due time (e.g. an own local currency and marketplace, or cooperation with local authorities).\n\nVerein: I'd be a little bit careful if Verein is really the right vehicle. In Germany a Verein is traditionally a group a people furthering a pastime, sport or charity of some sort, or preserving local tradition and such things. Many of them are tax-exempt due to meeting the neccessary criteria for exemption. Normally a Verein is not associated with doing business. There IS however a type of legal body similar in quite a few ways to a Verein but<u>intended</u>\u00a0for doing business, and that's the Cooperative (Genossenschaft). There are constructs whereby a Verein is used as a tax-exempt body to aid donations, and uses a Plc (GmbH) or such as its business-arm (which can then make a profit), or others involving a foundation (for endowments), but personally I find these somewhat cumbersome - as though people are effectively trying to get around legal restrictions.\n\nLeipzig: We'll be at the fairventure Congress in Leipzig on 7. - 8.

At first, this has started very modestly, with a few friends organizing clothing donations through the Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/%CE%A3%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CE%A0%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%86%CF%8D%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BDBackpacks-for-the-RefugeesSolutions-for-Homeless-148172338861553/?ref=bookmarks%20\">https://www.facebook.com/%CE%A3%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CE%A0%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%86%CF%8D%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BDBackpacks-for-the-RefugeesSolutions-for-Homeless-148172338861553/?ref=bookmarks </a>. At the beginning, I wasn\u2019t expending such a big response to my call, but volunteers -known and unknown- started visiting my clothing shop in Thessaloniki, bringing clothes and helping out to fill in the backpacks.\n\nWithin two months, this action spread virally all over Greece. Over time, I networked with other grassroots initiatives active in refugee care, such as the Alternative Immigrant Centre of Thessaloniki (@To-Steki) and Oikopolis. In some cases, people followed our instructions and respected our philosophy of unconditional giving, but there have also been problematic cases because there were also people that tried to hijack the process for personal gain.\n\nI have learned to live with the dynamics, and I started helping out at Oikopolis, to create a clothing storage, explaining an internationally used methodology of inventorying, so refugees were able to serve themselves on their own. This system still works, where refugees can come, try and take the clothes they need for free.\n\nWhile continuing to work with clothes, I now focus on providing school items for children and the campaign has shifted focus. From just catering for refugees, we also provide care for native homeless people. Through a Facebook page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/519478964902645/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/519478964902645/</a>, we are trying to organize volunteers who adopt the schooling needs/items of children in need. These needs may be covered through a donation of items or money, and this is open to everyone. So far, the stock gathered so far through donations, is enough for about 250 kids. In parallel, I am organizing seminars and crash courses on repairing clothes and upcycling old objects to create, for example, pencil boxes.\n\nThere is another task, which is more time-consuming and complex, in terms of research. I'm in the team-building process that will eventually become a non-profit legal entity, to develop a Handbook for the Management of Material and Resources, in cases of emergency. For example, due to my professional background, I know how to sort and store thousands of clothing items. Somebody else might have other skills. This is also connected with the sharing of knowledge of alternative treatments, practices or hacks, that might offer cheap and practical solutions to people in need. For example, using cocoa powder as a shampoo, or other uses of baking \u00a0soda, salt, etc.\n\nI come from Thessaloniki, and my ancestors were refugees. Initially, the response from my immediate environment has been disappointing. My job is in the clothing sector, however, being an elected Municipal Councillor at the City of Thessaloniki, people know my public activity so it was easy to build trust. Furthermore, I am sitting at the Management Board to the Municipal TV100 station. Having many contacts with journalists helped to communicate the action widely. All this combined has resulted in the massive spontaneous response of a community of 1500 citizens from all walks of life. Including people from Europe and the US, who donated waterproof jackets and blankets.\n\nAs s municipal councilor, I am in contact with local authorities. Sadly the Municipality responded very poorly, compared to what it could do. Same goes with the Ministry of Immigration Policy. We talked to the consultants, they appreciated our effort, but there was no practical result.\n\nUnfortunately, the public sentiment is negative. Mass media shape the opinion that the refugees stopped crossing borders, so people believe that they stopped coming. Others falsely believe that refugees are to blame for anything wrong. And since the beginning of the summer, most volunteers disappeared. This has, inevitably, resulted in a fatigue in the area of refugee care.\n\nNevertheless, I have no other option but continue. I wish to launch a crowdsourcing campaign, so the venture can continue. I imagine of a list of people with different skills, who -in the case of need- will be ready to take up a certain role. A type of inventory of what human assets exist and what everyone can contribute.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-09 08:04:24", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 16:01:49.410002", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 844, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 103.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1518, "user_id": 102, "topic_id": 1485, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Living in London has probably been one of my biggest life changes one can imagine, and for anyone new to London, it can be both terrifying and exciting in equal measure, depending on where life has taken you before landing here. For me, I spent 23 years of my life in a small town in the North of England, so to go from there to London was a big change, and if I were to advise someone on moving to London, I would give them the following tips -\u00a0\n\n<u><strong>Have a \"family\"</strong></u>\n\nI moved to London already knowing quite a few people as I spent a lot of time before making the move travelling backwards and forwards to go to gigs and visit friends so when I landed here somewhat permanently, I already had people around me to light the way. My actual family were over 300 miles away, so having strong friendships around me was absolutely needful. I gave myself six months in London, and there would be no shame in going home if it didn't work out. Nine years later and I'm still here. It is tough living here, but the opportunities it has created for me has far outweighed any of the negative traits of living in a city.\u00a0\n\n<u><strong>Don't be afraid</strong></u>\n\nAs I mentioned, a city (and specifically London for me) can be terrifying, and the last thing you need to be when moving to a busy city is timid. You need to get out and about as much as possible. If you expect a city to come to you and entertain you, or bring you opportunities, that isn't going to happen. To create a life that's pleasurable, you have to work hard to get it. There is a lot to be experienced, and you won't experience that sitting at home. You need to interact with people, places and cultures, of which there are many in most cities.\u00a0\n\n<u><strong>Sort yourself out financially</strong></u>\n\nI wish I was more financially savvy when I moved here! Cities are expensive places to live in, and housing isn't necessarily for ever, unlike the place you may have come from. I lived in the same home for 23 years, so running headlong in to the renting sector was a shock to the system. Have your finances in as strong an order as possible, and try to save some money too for that rainy day - they do happen and mostly at the most unexpected moments.\n\n<u><strong>Learn</strong></u>\n\nLearn as much as you can from everything that's around you. The experiences you will have in a city will be so different from anywhere else you will ever live, and it will prepare you for so much, like travelling internationally, communicating, and being aware of cultures and people.\u00a0\n\nI think a lot of these points could be aimed at any space in the world. If I were to move to the country (I wish!), my skills that I have gained here will have its uses there but again, I will have lots of different things to learn there as well. To move around the world, and space itself, you should always be open minded and enjoy every experience you can get. The world is a much richer place for open minded people moving around it and adding to it. Leave your mark.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-09 18:02:31", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 18:20:05.033404", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 603, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21783, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1416, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>\"Senior\" is not age-related</b>\n\nI should have specified that when I say \"senior\" I don't mean \"old\", I mean \"someone who has a high profile and useful knowledge and contacts that they can pass onto you\".

Add your changes directly to this wiki, also adding a comment to help us track major changes in the discussion below.\n\n\n## 1. Requirements for our temporary space in Morocco\n\nPlease also refer to the list of [Candidate houses for The Reef Morocco](/t/id/7171) and the topic for [selecting one](/t/id/7172).\n\nRequirements, in order of priority:\n\n1. **Budget.** The total budget available for this temporary / prototype space is 3000 USD (~2500 EUR). So the more expensive the rent, the fewer people we can host for less time. Some of the budget should be kept to buy equipment etc., so assume about 2500 USD (~2100 EUR) are available for the rent budget. That means approximately the following alternatives:\n\n    * 400 USD / month (~330 EUR / month) for 6 months\n    * 500 USD / month (~420 EUR / month) for 5 months\n    * 600 USD / month (~500 EUR / month) for 4 months\n    * 800 USD / month (~670 EUR / month) for 3 months\n    * 1200 USD / month (~1000 EUR / month) for 2 months\n\n2. **Attractive and suitable for interaction.** This is more important than the length of time we can keep the prototype space open. So we aim to get a nice place that can host the people and their workspace. The location (access to amenities, shops etc.) is also relevant. If the money only covers 3 months in such a space, that's ok.\n\n3. **Size.** The space should be able to host 8-10 people comfortably, plus their workspace.\n\n4. **Gender separate living spaces.** There has to be a way to separate living spaces (bedrooms and attached bathrooms) of female and male residents, due to cultural norms. For example, two apartments with separate entrances will do that, either on the same level or in different levels of the house. If necessary (and the landlord is ok with it), we can also add a door somewhere to separate a larger common living area.\n\n5. **Bathrooms.** There should be one bathroom per two bedrooms, more if possible.\n\n6. **Courtyard or terrace.** Highly desirable.\n\n7. **Separated workspace.** Separation between live-space and workspace is desirable, for example between ground floor and first floor.\n\n\n## 2. Requirements for The Reef MENA as a permanent space\n\nWhile in general all [OpenVillage house projects in the network](/t/id/6785) can choose any location they like \u2013 they are independent! \u2013 \"The Reef\" branded spaces are official Edgeryders spaces and directly run by the Edgeryders organization. So for these, we have our own specific set of requirements here. Other OpenVillage house projects may use them for inspiration of course :slight_smile: \n\nBy decreasing priority. Non-essential ones are more like a wishlist. We may want to get a more basic space for the project underway, and a \"better\" longer-term space lateron.\n\n1. **Welcoming host country (essential).** So far, both Tunisia or Morocco seem favourable for our purposes. Parameters of \"welcoming\": cheap transport to/from Europe and other MENA countries; reasonably open borders, ideally no visa required for short-term stays from either EU/US and other MENA countries; relaxed cultural climate, tolerant of Western mores; workable bureaucracy in registering rental contracts or businesses.\n\n2. **Close to markets (essential).** A prototyping environment is not so much like a library for entrepreneurs to study in peace; it's more like a buzzing bazaar where to hash out possible initiatives and easily meet possible partners and clients. Location decisions need to take this into account.\n\n3. **Reasonably close to a transport hub (essential).** Make it easy for the powerful and the well-connected to visit, with a view to enhancing the connections between residents and the local and global economies.\n\n4. **Cheap or free (essential).** It's important for proving future sustainability as early as possible to depend as little as possible on donor money for cost of living, esp. space rent. We want to establish a model that can be replicated thousands of times by independent groups throughout the region. Donor money is better invested for generative tools and materials. The ideal space is an abandoned commercial or industrial building that can be used for free, or in exchange for non-monetary compensation (cleanup and renovation tasks etc.). An abandoned public space is also good, but negotiating with local municipalities to get access to the building will take more time.\n\n5. **Free to change (essential).** We must be able to change what we want without having to ask anyone for permission, and without having to undo everything when moving out. Must include things like turning the front yard into a vegetable garden or fish pond, installing photovoltaics, installing a small wind turbine, putting a container into the backyard, painting everything inside and outside, making workshop noise, having a personal junkyard etc.. This means an abandoned space is most suitable.\n\n6. **Offer something special (essential).** To be attractive. Could be a strange space in a city (for example a boat, tower, \u2026) or a space in a town / village with spectacular nature around (and reasonable access to public transport).\n\n7. **Living / coworking space (essential).** Means an open space with multiple use as office, kitchen, living room and for smaller events. Maybe 80-100 m\u00b2 minimum for 10-15 participants?\n\n8. **Sleeping spaces (essential).** Sleeping quarters have to be gender separated. The two basic alternatives are: we may get a residential building with rooms meant to live in and book 2-3 people into a room, or we get a non-residential building and set up two dorm-style spaces there, with furnishing that gives a corner of private space to everyone.\n\n9. **Workshop space (essential).** A light-duty workshop. Can be made from any normal accommodation space, as no heavy equipment or special electrical installation is required. While technically coworking space, it should be separate from the living space :) 60 m\u00b2 is good for 10-15 participants, more is even better.\n\n10. **Outdoor space (essential).** Needed for gatherings and events, agriculture related actvities, and as living space for people with vehicle homes (like Matt's, which can serve as a living demo for off-grid living solutions). Ideally immediately attached to the living quarters, but can also be close by (\u2265500 m). Size can vary and will influence what's possible in the space: no wishes left with \u22652000 m\u00b2, while 200 m\u00b2 is a bare minimum for 10-15 participants.\n\n11. **Utilities (essential at first).** It's not that hard to make an off-grid home (photovoltaics, greywater evaporator, desalination plant, separating composting toilet). However when just moving in, this is not ready, and many people have some basic comfort requirements to feel attracted to a space. So the first space we search should have electricity, running water and sewage connections, and we can work in that space to create mobile technology that will provide off-grid capabilities and can also be taken to the next space.", "created_at": "2017-07-06 09:46:59", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 16:17:54.091679", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1156,

go</b>\n\nDry up Mafia's money supply - this approach is just great!\n\nAlso reminds me of an idea that I nearly forgot about. The inspiration was another activism approach that starts with customer behavior: In Al Jazeera's documentation on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfbdqVv9tiE\">slave labor in Brazil</a> there is a part about <a href=\"http://www.free2work.org/\">Free2Work</a>, an ingenious \"app-tivism\" initiative to end slave labor with the help of bar codes and smartphones: you point your smartphone on a product's bar code and the app fetches and displays a rating on how clean of slave labor thsi product is, with full transparency by breaking it down into 40 factors (also available on their website to check).\n\nIt appears to me that we could bundle all corporate behavior related activism issues into one integrated portal (and smartphone apps). All groups would contribute their data, and in the end there's a one-stop place for buyers to go to to find out factors to influence people's buying decisions. There would be no big \"overall rating\" for products and businesses, or people would have to configure it themselves, because opinions can differ (like about being vegane and global warming). But the list of factors might include, among others:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Crime factors.</strong> Is this shop pizzo free? Is the product corruption free?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Freedom rights.</strong> Is this product slave labor free (incl. prison labor, child labor, bonded labor)? What is the wage level and work conditions of the workers producing this? Is this product produced in countries respecting women's rights, minorities' rights, Internet freedoms, and human rights in general?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Sustainability.</strong> Is this product produced in eco-sustainable ways (including sustainable use of fishing, forests, minerals, fossil fuels)? Is this product produced as locally as possible, or is insane transportation involved?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Nature protection.</strong> Is this product ozone-friendly? Is this product vegan?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Responsibility.</strong> Is the gain from this product ultimately used to give back to society, or just for private consumption and for accumulating power? Is any financial speculation on food prices etc. supported from this product?</li>\n\n</ul>All this data gathering about companies and supply chains and all this data crunching seems quite an (impossible?) effort, but it would really fix the problem that evildoers can proceed just because nobody notices.\n\nAnybody knows of an existing effort in this direction? Have not found anything yet.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-24 23:58:03", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:50.578576", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 440, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9979, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6021, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Hopeful and daring story</b>\n\nAlways glad to see you growing your network @Natalia_Skoczylas! \u00a0If you have a photo of you and Olga.. let's just say\u00a0it would be nice to put a face to the name.\n\nCan we help in any way?

As @Pavlos\u00a0said, since he was a kid he saw degradation all around - his little coastal hometown, in North-Eastern Greece, surrounded by olive orchards, was always the reference point of a good life in a good space. Seeing the country devastated by urban sprawl, beaches consumed by villas and bars, and people being happy about this, worried him since a long time. So, after receiving education in Scotland, Germany, and researching native tribes of China and Thailand, he didn't only come back to Greece to rethink its food culture. He also decided to work on the climate.\u00a0\n\nPavlos is involved with climatetracker.org, an international team of young writers and quite possibly the biggest environmental youth movement of people from all around the world. These are decentralized and nonhierarchical groups led by activists in the Carribean, Europe, Latin America. They cover events in UN or COPs but also do investigative journalism on a local scale. Their work unmasks lobbies and harmful practices and has been published in key media across the globe. They also organize webinars and campaigns and often encourage writers to concentrate on a certain issue in a given period of time.\u00a0\n\nAnd Pavlos has an idea. Greece can become a hotspot of international dialogue on sustainability and resilience. As the country struggles with, as Pavlos has beautifully put it, \"restoring the zombie economy\", it innovates and experiments along the way. The social innovation and solidarity, however highly spontaneous and uncoordinated, are the backbone for the change. What would be necessary now is to organize those in collaboration with the right minds from all over the world in order to use the whole potential of this change and build a national economy that is regenerative and sustainable?\u00a0\n\nEven though Greek politicians and intellectuals in many cases seem stuck decades ago and their resistance to change is huge, what's happening around proves its inescapable. Pavlos thinks the best for them would be to funnel the energy into protecting marginalized groups, including the refugees, to lower their costs of transition.\u00a0\n\nThe Greek crisis has a side that not many people talk about - how would paying back the debt affects its environment. Pavlos believes paying off the money lent from the international institutions would create a huge ecological debt in terms of lack of sustainable land use and waste management.\u00a0\n\nNow, as the demos has been neglected and their voice hijacked during the last referendum, it's time to accept, at least tolerate, widespread civil disobedience that will drive the movement. 62% that disagreed has been silent so far, but it will have to speak soon. Even more, what seems to be an alternative idea, is not alternative anymore there - it's the only way out. Greece is exploring the open data tools and sharing knowledge, prototyping new was of accountability, transparency, decision making. And here the health and care appear again. Pavlos has seen plenty of interesting and viable practices and conclusions forming from the bottom-up, grassroots practice in Greece. These are the ways in which delivering health care has changed, in which social organization has challenged the systemic shortcomings. From those experiments and pieces emerges a complex, wide image of more inclusive future. It is built on the exchange of ideas and practices in an open manner. It rethinks the way we deliver care in a more decentralized way, more concentrated on prevention. It reframes urban food systems by educating people on the impact of what they eat on their health. Contemporary lifestyle jeopardizes 50 years of development in the health sector - food related diseases, new viruses, climate change, they all have a huge, negative impact on the quality of our lives. Technology and science, accompanied by open data and sharing, can prevent disastrous effects of those phenomena.\u00a0\n\nFinally, I asked how would he explain his entrepreneurial path to those opposing the market? He said a couple of things I find hilarious and worth considering. First of all, that activism is for city people - while he wanted to go back to his olive groves and do the farm life. Secondly, there is a dire need of changing the way people do business - in a sustainable way, with respect to diversity, with a different concept of what's valuable. It's not the price of land and potential golf courses, not the cheap fast forest. Thirdly, doing things like bread plates is not a rocket science - but if successful it points towards effective and regenerative entrepreneurship. Therefore, an entrepreneur doing such kind of work realizes the visions of an activist - by actually convincing a chain of restaurants to deliver local, better coffee or beer, by cutting off the middlemen. It means millions of people affected in a positive way. It takes a solid ethical concept and guts to take risks, but it pays off in many ways. And it fills the unemployment gap, which wastes the potential of a whole generation now. Interacting with the system is the way for Pavlos. And I really like the fact he's not used to failing.\u00a0\n\nYou can read the first part of the article here:\u00a0https://edgeryders.eu/en/transforming-food-systems-in-post-crisis-greece-conversation-with\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-02 12:56:36", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 04:07:01.307956", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 909, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 165.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1482, "user_id": 31, "topic_id": 1449, "post_number": 1, "raw": "[I'm writing this as a response to Alberto Cottica's very appropriate challenge: <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/bring-allies/mission_case/fighting-muppetocracy#comment-344\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/bring-allies/mission_case/fighting-muppetocracy#comment-344</a>]\n\nI haven't been successful so far, and I know. I just hope some subproducts will be useful later.\n\nSince I was a boy, and that's decades ago, I heard of things that were possible (\"hey, so much wind here, this could power up an entire place\") and I heard of exponential changes that by definition were unsustainable (the steep population curve\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15391515\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); \" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/<wbr>world-15391515</wbr></a>\u00a0was one I found my place in).\n\nThe Canary Islands, were I live, are said to be a small continent due to the variety of microclimates. Through the decades, we've come from being very much localised in terms of food, to being 85% dependent on imports.\u00a0For energy it's 95%, maybe more, and as far as I know it doesn't really matter because the point is fuel is needed to start the generators, even if you add some wind later. Water? Water is energy: you need fuel to move water from place to place, and in some very dry islands you need fuel to desalinate sea water.\n\nI heard ecologists pull their hair off and say there's no way out but reducing the number of people, and that fired my calculator up. Really? Is multiple deaths the only way forward? You can't be serious, can you?\n\n2 million people living on 7400 square kilometers, much of the land (I think 45% or so) is a bioreserve, so ... let me do the maths ... that's two thousand square meters per person, so maybe if half were to be arable land, and adding food from the sea ... it's conceivable that we might feed ourselves.\n\nNot saying it would be desirable, wanted, or the only way forward.\u00a0Just saying, hey, it would be possible. And yes, there are some elements that tell us it should be somewhat desirable: peak oil, climate change, the possibility of big-time disruptions, plain good health from a fresher diet, and other motivations.\n\nThing is, let's first gather the data, and from that reality, we can happily choose our way forward, build our vision, get things done. Right?\n\nWrong. At least so far, I haven't yet succeded in making any real advances.\n\nFirst, I looked at the factors related to growing food. Very sketchy, but here it is:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.appropedia.org/Global_Food_Swadeshi_Project\">http://www.appropedia.org/Global_Food_Swadeshi_Project</a>\n\nSecond, I started Canaripedia, currently hosted at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.appropedia.org/Canaripedia\">http://www.appropedia.org/Canaripedia</a>\u00a0and with a more generalisable page, in English but not fully translated, at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.appropedia.org/Localpedia\">http://www.appropedia.org/Localpedia</a>\u00a0[Wrote some of that at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.appropedia.org/TheFWD_lucasgonzalez_No_island_is_an_island\">http://www.appropedia.org/TheFWD_lucasgonzalez_No_island_is_an_island</a>]\u00a0I had gathered some data myself. About food, we import 85% of what we eat, but we also export a lot, so much that at the end of the day, we grow 1 kilogram per person and per day - only most of it is bananas and tomatoes, which would mean a boring diet indeed. And, know what, apparently that's what we eat every day: 1 kilogram per person - more if you count assorted liquids, but please do your maths or collect your statistics.\n\nAbout arable land, it's said that in my island, Tenerife, 53% of the arable land is not being used to grow food.\u00a0At the same time, I think it's about 200,000 people who don't have a job.\u00a0So why doesn't it work differently?\u00a0I still don't know, but I think the answer is hidden in plain sight at several levels, all mingled with each other.\n\n1) A permaculturist once asked me: \"why don't <strong>you</strong> grow food?\". That one is easy. \"I don't know how to. I don't have land. I don't have time. I make money doing things I know and that pays for the food others grow.\" Also, I took a short course on ecological agriculture, but it clearly didn't break my current reality: I'd rather do other things.\n\n2) I've asked people around me: \"why don't <strong>people who are jobless</strong> grow food?\". The answer seems to be related to \"markets\": \"It's easier to import food than to grow it. You make 10 cents while the supermarkets make 90 cents. So for now it's more profitable to wait.\" Also, food takes time to grow, and is risky. Plus, I suppose, some of the answers I gave at the personal level.\n\n3) Going up another level, I've asked why don't <strong>governments</strong> push local food more? I'm not sure at all. It may be that they get money from taxing current economic activity, and that's currently tourism (ups and downs, now everybody seems to be glad Egypt is not such a tourist-friendly place), used to be building hotels and appartments (no more), and well, just like in many other places, we seem to serve each other with haircuts and cellphone shops.\n\nIn any case, at all levels, the <strong>motivation</strong> to change things is not there, at least it's not there yet, as far as I know. [If motivation comes abruptly, we might be in for a tough ride, cos food takes time to grow. Hence the concept of \"emergency permaculture\":\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.appropedia.org/Emergency_permaculture\">http://www.appropedia.org/Emergency_permaculture</a>.]\n\nMy motivation? I think it's possible and desirable to grow more of the food we eat locally. We're converting fuel into smoke and soil into toilet waste. Sustainable things fall down. At times, it feels somewhat scary to live far from the mainland. I think we could do really great things: \"21 century food\". [I've been helping the folks at Open Source Ecology <a href=\"http://blog.opensourceecology.org\">http://blog.opensourceecology.org</a>, and the outgrowth in Europe <a href=\"http://oseeurope.org\">http://oseeurope.org</a> But the first are focused on building the machines and documenting them, and the second are, most appropriately, taking their time to find their own way forward. I can't do more than I'm doing.]\n\nI don't know what to do. Thinking about next year, I think I need to look at the hard realities and start some kind of <strong>dialogue</strong> as to what to do next - where and how will be my questions. Farming in my window seems pointless. Filling up a wikipage with data doesn't seem to cut it. I guess I'll have to have conversations, join people who are already doing things, see why those who might are not doing things, and really find some leverage.\n\nI don't know if I'm an edgeryder. Maybe I am. My job is supposedly stable (I may be more stable than my job, the way some things seem to be headed), it's really interesting at times (done some cool things there), and pays my bills. At the same time, I've clearly done some things that prove, at least to me personally, that I'm ready to start things that are not written in the job description. But I feel really silly suggesting other people might farm when I clearly won't do it myself.\n\nMaybe I'm on the edge of becoming a real edgeryder. How many of us out there?\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-17 22:55:32", "updated_at": "2017-09-09 04:50:31.089987", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1369, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6360, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6327, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>Notes from our community call yesterday, contributed by Alex, Noemi &amp; co.

These conversations are scalable and encodable, so for every comment posted, a relationship is created in the database between the sender and the person to which the comment was addressed. When you extract the database and put it in a network analysis software, you can get a graph visualization of the network and key metrics hinting at several characteristics, among which the number of unique relationships formed (edges), number of comments (degrees), no. of connections a user would need to make to reach any other user (average distance).\n\nWe had over ten comparable datasets to play with, and dove directly into our burning questions, my own being essentially <strong>how to measure the effect (if any) of community managers work on community health?</strong> This is harder than it seems because health could mean such different things: it could be a very high rate of user account creation and content generation, it could be dense conversations between members, or it could be many smaller groups connected by very efficient brokers, so that anyone is at two steps away from each other and resources if needed. For some, it simply means a lively environment where people are busy connecting to each other, so we operationalized it as users\u2019 activity (comments) that\u2019s not directed at moderators.\n\nTo community builders investing energy nurturing conversation after conversation, a correlation with the amount of community contributions would mean that they\u2019re doing something right (whether community response is a direct effect of their dedication among other factors, that is harder to establish).\n\n<span><span><img alt=\"All_communities_health.jpg\" height=\"473px;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oxuMREv-YgNaes6pgbOg0rGE2PFZq1WMzhytoCNb3cCx8z0ybvS2oHhpF32JcY1bNRjM-u5e2SHKtFq0w_DcPyveZX8jNvbsRJti40nOnROZRVBvOnXnX9fU8ZZx1jQ3iCV-YNw\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"494px;\"></span></span>\n\nThe above is a scatterplot of how this relationship unfolds in Edgeryders (global network of change makers), Matera 2019 (local community of citizens), Innovatori PA (a community of practitioners in the NGO sector) and other mailing list communities. Each dot is the number of comments by community (Y axis) corresponding to a number of comments by moderator (X axis) in a week during the last two years. The violet dots are Edgeryders, and it is also where the relationship was most significant.\n\nContext: These are mostly lasting communities, but their moderation policies are very different, and so is the response: you would see high activity when moderators are little visible, or low, but consistent activity allowing the community to keep decent member ranks. In Edgeryders, a small group go out of their way to make everyone feel welcome and encourage collaboration. Not surprisingly, a dozen moderators account for half of all relationships in the network, which means they know everyone and are part of most conversations. The different shapes of networks offer some clues as to how connections are made.

This confirms experience: some people start off as really active contributors and then disappear; others come in, look around, lay low, and then surface when a topic perceived as meaningful emerges. The relevance of the content is clearly an important variable, and it is what most informs our style of engagement - which is stronger when associated with major events or community projects.\n\nObserving Edgeryders registered in August/Sept 2013 throughout 3 months, and same for the year after, we see some common behavior (look at the curves below), mainly because the period is synced to the Living on the Edge events \\#3 and \\#4, which see more evenly distributed platform activity.\n\n<span><span><img alt=\"Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2015-03-11 a\u0300 15.32.44.jpeg\" height=\"183px;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Hb0zIiwe6RYPvkI9944S2oMf6avNhwpA05h9gmEPZBdYthP4epW4_-6AY8xRUoL4Pm3e-2VrE31qALVZg6jZ09ijbzgWR9AdoTKDfa8bBx10nmQrumKs-XHNzwDjeJKSrWYFLJQ\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"624px;\"></span>\n\n<span>2013</span></span>\n\n<span><span><img alt=\"Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2015-03-11 a\u0300 16.04.07.jpeg\" height=\"156px;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lgEy9uwdtqtb4bp80YjLXAz9PmIRZcgcfDrLZOf4yqPrYBQ7cMzZBWh3kNlUnRJza39UObbaU8_NnFFkufOHm4efUz6maYEJKn4E-loKOckMBXDT-zmLd-aBdQuwMppYdk7c2GQ\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"624px;\"></span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>2014</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo much more is to be dug from the data, hacked and learned, and luckily we have in <a href=\"/u/brenoust\">@brenoust</a>, <a href=\"/u/melancon\">@melancon</a>, <a href=\"/u/luca_mearelli\">@Luca_Mearelli</a>, @Alberto\u00a0and others here true help (thanks to all of you for providing the infrastructure and beautiful network representations/ visualizations during MoN3!). Human behavior being highly complex and unpredictable, we are still a long way of learning what is shaping any person\u2019s ability to contribute. What\u2019s pretty clear to me, having worked closely with Edgeryders and confirmed more of own intuitions, is that online community management is crucial and pays off when working for social change, especially when forging relationships between global citizens or facilitating conditions for highly capable knowledge workers to work remotely from each other and in their own terms. \u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-13 20:35:34", "updated_at": "2017-09-25 14:03:28.785984", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1568, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5570, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5537, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\nPresent: @eirinimal @alberto, @alessandro_contini @rossana_torri @moushira @noemi @patrick_andrews @costantino, Silvia\n\nAgenda for the call:\n\n<strong>1. Alberto\u2019s <a href=\"/t/the-opencare-bigger-picture-for-year-1/5522\">Big Picture for Open Care Year 1</a></strong>: we need to collectively contribute to a post publicly outlining our work this year. If no one wants to do it, Alberto volunteers to write it\n\nRelated topic here: Documentation. \n\nEven from last weeks call we discussed some of the constraints in bringing stories from the very ground (In Milano) online and the barriers to participation.\n\nAlberto: It is worrying that documentation is perceived as hard to get, as we wrote it in the proposal and now have to execute.\n\nRossana: We are waiting to hear from people we are engaging and who would be more comfortable to tell us things that may be private. On the 4th of May we are starting activities of co-design with Milano communities and it would be a better time to collect stories. Also, video operator needs time to process the material etc.\n\nCosta: we are not active on the website, but we will as soon as we have confirmation from the community and partners we engage.\n\nThe offline activities are not aligned at the moment with online activities.\n\nOur 1 hour events are not enough to onboard them - Milano events are not conversations yet, they go one way. These activities are more of a warmup, our hope is to get their attention in the co-design sessions.\n\nEirini: I know of this EU funded project (crappy UX&gt; sorry). <a href=\"http://www.innovvoice.com/\">http://www.innovvoice.com/</a> it's platform where you can post your challenge/problem and then receive comments and collaborate further on the develpment of some projects (the hacking @alessandro). quite familiar idea (crowdsourcing innovation). but this is what you are actually proposing as far as I understand maybe take some ideas from those guys in order to facilitate this sharing and co-creating\n\n<strong>2. Costa &amp; Co. proposal for a new Open Care landing page</strong> (complementary to the one we have now)\n\nA very hard project because it is a meta-project: we strive not to build something, but first understand what is the right approach to solving a problem.\n\nWe propose a new landing page above the content and landing pages already there. A one page website - very simple and clear and explain OpenCare in one minute to anyone. Link to proper resources so people can get more involved. Hosted outside of edgeryders.eu .\n\nExample: <a href=\"https://openideo.com/\">https://openideo.com/</a>\n\nAlessandro: user story example \u201cIf I\u2019m a developer and want to dig right into the code - I should be able to access the github rep immediately\u201d\n\nNeeds to answer key questions: What is OpenCare? How can I find more info? Who is doing it?\n\nTools have to be as simple as possible.\n\nWeMake are preparing a clear HowTo guide mapping the environment of relevant projects in the Care field (DYI, Maker world).

One more thing that can break and needs maintenance. Edgeryders does not take responsibility for web pages outside of its website.\n\nThis was about it. Everyone, let us know what you think as we're collecting input before and after each meeting, so that we save some time (one hour is not enough to get everyone's opinions on topics).\n\nNext call is on Monday, 16:30 CET.

Many were also involved in <a href=\"https://occupyoakland.org/\" target=\"_top\">Occupy Oakland</a>, and wanted to establish a more permanent organization with the same community spirit and values. Eventually, the community we built in the hacker space reached a critical mass of knowledge and interest around the idea of starting to producing insulin with a manual protocol, but one designed to be simpler and less expensive than existing methods. We named the project \u201cOpen Insulin\u201d to reflect a commitment to make the results freely available to any interested party and publish our methods openly. The name was a deliberate reference to open source software.\n\nOpen source, as many readers may know from the software world, is the practice of making all information necessary to produce and modify a product publicly available along with the product itself. It started in software as an alternative to the practice of providing only machine-readable copies of programs, which can\u2019t be understood or practically changed by users of the software. Without access to human-readable code, users and other stakeholders were shut out of their own tools. Open source methods of production are relevant not just to aligning incentives and improving the economics of software development, but also to scientific reproducibility and transparency, and in both software and science, open source can enable more participation and progress than trying to hold secrets close. In medicine in general, and diabetes treatments in particular, I think it holds one of the keys to breaking through the barrier between promising research and a stagnant market of treatments available to patients, just as it made software much more efficient to produce and use and enabled a great deal more innovation than was otherwise possible.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e56ebbaf00251fa5215a05d5a86937f780d62127.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\">\n\n\u00a0\n\nOpen source software and the hacker culture that makes it was a major inspiration for biohackers to organize as such. \u201cBiohacker\u201d derives from the term \u201chacker\u201d in the sense used in the communities of early pioneers of computing, where it\u2019s a term used to refer to people who seek to understand how things work on the inside, instead of just using products as a consumer. Hackers are people who seek to modify things to serve their own purposes, instead of just accepting them as being limited to their originally intended purposes. It\u2019s an approach that emphasizes the philosophical concepts of <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Phronesis\" target=\"_top\">phronesis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Techne\" target=\"_top\">techne</a>, which describe an embodied, contextualized, practical approach to things, applied to science and technology. Biohackers are people who take a practical approach to understanding and engineering biological systems, and look beyond appearances and inside the black boxes of commercial products to understand the substance and true implications of things.\n\n<strong>If we can achieve the creation of open source insulin, it could contribute to at least three important goals </strong>- first, by making insulin production more economical at a smaller scale, and opening up manufacturing to much more competition, it could improve cost and access for patients. Second, we hope the protocol will serve as a basis for future research into improvements to insulin - variants that are longer acting, shorter acting, more temperature stable, and so on - that address different concerns that arise in treatment. Third, we hope it might serve as a basis for research and production of other proteins by small groups, and open up participation in research and development to accelerate progress in other aspects of diabetes treatment besides insulin and other areas of science and medicine besides diabetes treatment.\n\nCurrently we\u2019re working on a novel method to produce human insulin, which is not patented, and as far as I know is not patentable. There are variations on normal human insulin to make them longer or shorter acting, which involve very small changes to the sequence that codes for human insulin.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1e84d773ce67d449206df517f4a85e6bcaf9d51f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>We\u2019ve been working in the lab for about 10 months, and we\u2019re just seeing the first signs of success on our first major milestone,</strong> the production of proinsulin, which is the precursor to insulin. Once we\u2019ve verified our success there, we\u2019ll move on to making the final form of insulin.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3eca20a9e3c23e95378e472cd08306f82b9f0623.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe face two main challenges. First, while we are a group of talented and curious folks, most of us are learning challenging lab protocols from scratch, and second, we\u2019re working with limited amounts of time and money, fitting the work into gaps in our schedules left by work or school, and mainly relying on surplus equipment and reagents that add delays and uncertainties to our work. So progress can be slow and involve a lot of detours on top of those implied by the already uncertain nature of scientific investigation, and we have to dig deep to figure out what to do next when something goes wrong. We do our best to learn fast, but it\u2019s difficult to follow up on everything we should with our limited time and resources and background knowledge. There\u2019s a lot of practical wisdom around making insulin that doesn\u2019t show up directly in the papers published in scientific journals, and we\u2019re learning these nuances of making things work as we go. Much of the value we hope to provide to the community is documenting as much of this practical wisdom as we can, and perhaps eventually automating the kind of work we\u2019re doing by hand right now.\n\n<strong>If all goes well, we hope our techniques will be available to people with diabetes, especially to help meet the needs of people in resource-poor and lower-income countries.</strong> However, it\u2019s hard to say at this point when we might be able to deliver a result useful for making a pharmaceutical-grade product. After the scientific work, which might take a few years, there will be the work of seeking business partnerships and going through more engineering work and the biosimilar approval process in the US. In other areas of the world, it may be simpler, but might also involve more unusual local political considerations. We\u2019re hoping that our work will inspire others to move in parallel alongside us and increase the chances that one group will succeed quickly, and there are some preliminary signs that this is happening, which could yield results sooner. But there\u2019s no doubt we\u2019re at the start of a very long and winding road.\n\nWe\u2019ve had the good fortune to have many experts in relevant fields reach out to advise us to smooth out our path, but many important questions remain, and the most important ones remain for us to find new answers. Scientists who are reading this \u2013 can we count on you to contribute your expertise in protein expression and purification? Organizers \u2013 can you share with us your vision for expanding these efforts into a movement with participation from parallel groups like ours around the world?\n\n<font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><i>The production of this article was supported by</i></font></font><font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><i>\u00a0</i></font></font><font color=\"#0000ff\"><u><a href=\"/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296\" target=\"_top\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><i>Op3n Fellowships</i></font></font></a></u></font><font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><i><b>\u00a0</b></i></font></font><font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><i>- an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.</i></font></font>\n\n<a href=\"/t/openvillage/788\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"85\">\n\n</a>", "created_at": "2016-11-09 08:57:58", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 07:43:39.286006", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1622, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 265.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1031, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 998, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Here is where you can find the tools we are using for communication, coordination and task/project management for all the current ongoing project organised by initative.

Social Capital for Social Ventures\n\nThe Social Capital for Social Ventures (#sc4sv), led by <a href=\"http://cookiesncode.com/about/\">Nadia El-Imam</a> and <a href=\"http://vinay.howtolivewiki.com/blog/about\">Vinay Gupta</a>. The idea is to mobilize non-monetary inputs towards social business creation: \u201cBy putting time and specialized skills (like language or design skills) at the disposal of new small enterprises, we take what we have (skills, time and talent) and use it to fill in the gaps left by what we don\u2019t have: access to investments of financial capital. This is self-help into employment for a largely unfunded generation.\u201d\n\n### 2. Edgeryders Knowledge Integration Program\n\nThe Edgeryders Knowledge Integration Program (#EKIP), led by <a href=\"http://access-space.org/doku.php?id=about:team#james_wallbankceo\">James Wallbank</a>. The idea is to teach each other to develop locally sustainable businesses: \u201cParticipating EKIP initiatives [in the UK, Germany, Poland and Italy] have developed grassroots responses to local economic and social challenges, and are building sustainable business models based on their particular insights. Common factors include a strong engagement with information communication technologies, facilitation of peer-learning and co-working methodologies, flexibility to specific local conditions, and structural independence from large scale institutions.\u201d\n\n### 3. The unMonastery\n\nThe unMonastery (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/unmonastery\">@unMonastery</a>), led by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benvickers_\">Ben Vickers</a>. The idea is to redeploy monastic life as a template for collaboration and innovation: \u201cWe\u2019re working together to develop a new kind of social space that combines the best of hackspaces with a living environment, the primary function aims to actively serve the buildings local community.\n\n### 4.

Our mission is to expand collective material and organizational capacities in order to build revolution in the 21st century. With a workshop, library, kitchen, and meeting space, we focus on efforts to self-organize, connect, create infrastructures, and develop greater individual and collective efficacy. \u00a0The Woodbine Health Autonomy Resource Center is a communal space in the neighborhood of Ridgewood, Queens. \u00a0It is part of the Autonomy General Assembly, which is a gathering space for the different projects that are housed within Woodbine. \u00a0The idea behind Woodbine comes in the wake of Occupy, but takes its motivations from the Zapatistas in Chiapas, the ZADs in France, communities in Rojava, and all those who have struggled for liberation. \u00a0\n\nAs we begin answering questions of autonomy, we are faced with the myriad of material obstacles in our way. \u00a0Health, or our lack thereof, can be seen as a crucial weakness in the revolutionary struggle. \u00a0We are tied to a \u201cmodern\u201d health system that fundamentally removes our bodies from a larger physical reality. \u00a0We are made to become cells in revolt, aberrant genes, failed organs, physicalities riddled with disease. \u00a0Disease becomes individualized as \u201chealth\u201d and \u201cwellness\u201d becomes commodified. \u00a0States of mental health become symbols of individualized weakness. Propensities toward depressed states, or anxious disorders, and \u201cimbalances\u201d in the brain necessitate chemical intervention, while never addressing the overwhelming emptiness of modern life. \u00a0An insane mind is the mind that can adapt to an insane society, and from the news today, we are surely going insane. \u00a0Insanity as the only rational response to an insane world, but what contemporary visions of \u201chealth\u201d require of us, in order to perpetuate this economy, is that we be atomized, necessarily taking on our struggles alone, seeing them as the individual product of a weak, chemically imbalanced mind. If we refuse this logic, begin to express the anger necessary for a health that recognizes the truly horrific nature of the time we\u2019re living in and develop shared practices of care that diffuse that isolation, we can begin to grow the collective backbone we so desperately need.\n\nApart from a critique of modern theories on health, we as a community have lost all control over our health. \u00a0Our individualized choices to workout, eat right, not smoke, etc are important, but wholly insufficient to answer the demands of this century. \u00a0In order to access healthcare, we are tied to jobs that are literally killing us, whether it be mental depravity or physical degradation. \u00a0Many people are in constant fear of losing this state granted access, but then are also in fear of having to access such a system, a system that is the cause of more than 50% of bankruptcies. \u00a0Because we have relegated health to these institutions, we have lost our ability to heal ourselves. \u00a0We no longer know the abundance of nature in helping to create health. \u00a0Most people cannot perform basic first aid or use simple techniques for health. \u00a0Many communities lack any cognizance or skill to handle the inevitable emotional collapse of our comrades. \u00a0In addition, these institutions fundamentally cannot address the issues of climate change, economic collapse, or disruption of key infrastructure. \u00a0They are as weak as we are, as evidenced by the effects of superstorms on the health infrastructure of New Orleans and New York. \u00a0How can these institutions help us when the very air we breath is killing us? \u00a0How do they help us adapt to a world without clean water? \u00a0To answer the sadness in our souls to live in a world where we have killed all the fish in the ocean? \u00a0\n\nTo answer simply, they cannot. \u00a0\n\nThey are tied to the same system we are, replete with the same fundamental limitations. \u00a0But we are not the same. While we are in chains, we are not of the system. \u00a0\n\nWe have not always lived this way. \u00a0\n\nAnd to remember this fact is to regain our humanity. \u00a0\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Where we are now</h2>\n\nWithin Woodbine, the struggle for autonomy has been broken down into specific \u201ctracks\u201d, meant to focus our attention on tangible obstacles to building functioning communities. \u00a0The health track is composed of a mix of health professionals and those with informal training in various health practices. \u00a0We place an emphasis on re-creating a sense of community wellness and the dissemination of skills. \u00a0We work to create ties with those who practice herbal medicines, massage, kinesiology, acupuncture, meditation, yoga and other forms of so called \u201calternative\u201d medicine. \u00a0We work on owning our own definition of wellness, from the physical to the mental. \u00a0In addition, we investigate current systems of western medicine, skills, and ultimately, work to develop an ability to manipulate these institutions to serve our goals. \u00a0We do not reject modern methods of medicine, but rather recognize the need to detach the knowledge from the oppressive institutions that guard it. Food and the environment have a fundamental role in health, and because of this, will have their own tracks to address their wide breadth of knowledge. \u00a0Overall, this track allows us to answer the questions of how do we begin the process of removing our physical and mental minds from an oppressive system, to reclaim our control over health and use health to increase our collective autonomy. \u00a0\n\nWithin the city, there is a public health infrastructure with clinics and hospitals. \u00a0While there are significant problems associated with these institutions, they do provide much of the emergency and chronic care in the city. \u00a0There are also spaces dedicated to holistic type medicine, although many of these are inaccessible to large portions of the population. \u00a0For these reasons, we started by building a health resource center within our Woodbine space. \u00a0The space is meant to be a means to involve community members, understand the care-related skills they have, and be an informational center. \u00a0We have public open times for the community, staffed by one of our members. \u00a0We also have begun offering a series of basic skills, including basic first aid, wound care,community health, food and nutrition, wellness, and many others. \u00a0Our goal is that participants can use the informational aspect to understand their disease process, find resources of different modalities, and either receive aid in navigating the health systems in place or find treatment within the space itself. \u00a0And finally, we have a preventative aspect, with our communal Sunday dinners, organic farm share, and weekly workout sessions, where we are beginning the process of owning our own health.\n\n<h2>Where we are going</h2>\n\nOur overarching goal is to examine what health autonomy would look like for us here in the city. \u00a0We are beginning with the basics by providing ways to interact with neighbors, to think of health in a communal sense, and to aggregate the people and resources from which to begin our journey. \u00a0Our short term goal is to continue with our introductory skill shares, create concrete ways to navigate the overwhelming health infrastructure that exists, and build a health community. \u00a0We are also beginning to experiment with providing care outside of the realm of state control. \u00a0This practice may involve working outside the structure of licenses, certifications and insurance. \u00a0Our intention is always to heal, and so we must find ways to do so that protects providers and patients. \u00a0As we progress, we will consider creating a larger clinical space, with more emphasis on offering a range of clinical modalities. \u00a0Finally, as Woodbine looks to expand our sense of territory to upstate NY, we will look to an expansion of the project to include a more rural context, likely in the form of a functioning low-fee/no-pay clinic. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs we move through the journey towards health autonomy, we find ourselves in a context that has removed us from our ability to understand our reality . \u00a0We fight that disconnection and work to build the infrastructure that can allow us the space to envision a new existence. \u00a0We look forward to hearing your stories, to understand your struggles and to collectively create the foundations to answer these monumental questions. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2>My questions for peers doing related work elsewhere\u2026</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tHow do you create sustainability?

But I won't grief over not being perceived as a person, if it looks so on paper. I know, you are an ethnographer, you can see patterns, and I would really like to hear your insights on group dynamics and tendencies, as well as our conversations to go beyond personal and individual.\n\nunMon, as we know, is not just it's Materani iteration. It implies working with patterns. That's why unMon in a box. People acquaint with system thinking put work into it and that's how I remember unMon being born.\n\nI would like to keep this conversation going. Keep it free from empty politics, but contain a good constructive reflection.\n\nPoints I want to make here in response to your comment is on the levels of martyrdom, as well as the invitation to have a constructive reflection on group dynamics.\n\n1. That martyrdom is only good in a certain proportion. unMon is also connected to Making a living/Making Sense balance. The idea is that it provides basics and allows people to make sense. (I'm aware of the fact that my presence at unMon didn't make much sense to you, but the beauty of this platform is that heretics can speak)\n\n2. That good group dynamics, and social balance requires work of all stakeholders. It is not all about chewy veggies, nor individuals.\n\nYes, I know, it feels good, but, seriously:\u00a0 \"moved out of their comfort zone, gave up their usual support network, their living, eating and sleeping habits, and moved into an unfinished building with a few strangers; and other members of the community who safely continued their daily lives and looked in from the outside.\"\u00a0\n\nDid your really feel this? \"joining the unMonastery started with making oneself vulnerable and feeling somewhat powerless. No family members, no financial assets, no familiar situations, just a group of strangers and an obviously enormous amount of work to do\"\u00a0 If yes, I think it should be addressed in some way. Feeling sorry for my self never helped me to move forward, and I dont agree that putting too much martyrdom in unMon pattern language is a particularly good idea.\n\nPeople come and stay because most of us wish to be a part of. Community, team, tribe. I strongly believe that, because I see it everywhere and also trust my own experience on that. That's why I stick to Edgeryders myself. Because I am\u00a0 a part of. (I even believe *secrtely, that it is not even a strong or clear idea which makes people come together, it is longing for being a part of, because it is deeply emotional, this is the beauty and a danger of it)\n\nAnd I'm a product of individualistic society, aren't we all, and will never find that paradise lost. I have seen non individualistic societies in action. I envy it, but at the same time it is scary and it's tough. It no morning practice, and no martyrdom. (I'm talking Southern Siberia, not social innovation smart villages). It is also for life, not for 3 month.\n\nOthers pay money to live in a hut and plant trees in Sahara, because it makes them feel that they are a part of something and doing something real. I'm not sure I would buy that, but people do. So can we all stop raving about how hard the life in the unMonastery was? There were hot showers, and fresh vegetables from Fucine Eco Market, and there were toilets, indoors . As long as you take time to clean the toilets, it's fine.\n\nIn the case of unMon, no one forced people to give up a bit of comfort. I know from @Bembo, in February veggies were bitter and chewy, but it is not a prison after all. People came and were free to leave on the same day if they found a temperature and the humidity levels uncomfortable. Please, don't take me wrong. I don't laugh. I respect people's feelings, contrary to a popular belief, and I don't ask to return the favour. I know, things were not so smooth, but come on...\n\nIt is not about chewy veg.

Let's make use of the ability to attune ourselves with others (empathy, compassion) and the willingness to help (supportive gestures) \u2013 that seem to be intrinsic to human nature \u2013 to rethink our future and build a society that promotes cooperation.</font></font></font>\n\n<font face=\"Arial, Lucida Grande, Verdana, sans-serif\" style=\"line-height: 0.17in; \"><font size=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 8pt\">To do so it is important to understand the purpose of Business, </font></font><font face=\"Arial, Lucida Grande, Verdana, sans-serif\" style=\"line-height: 0.17in; \"><font size=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 8pt\"><i>that</i></font></font><font face=\"Arial, Lucida Grande, Verdana, sans-serif\" style=\"line-height: 0.17in; \"><font size=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 8pt\"> in which we allocate the majority of our time and energy. Business (from 'bisig', busy + ness; 'sense of work, occupation') is the origin and capitalism the engine we've created triggering prosperity and progress. Quoting Polly LaBarre, we need to <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/02/reimagining_capitalism.html\">\u201creimagine a profoundly principled, fundamentally patient, and socially accountable capitalism\u201d</a>.</font></font>\n\n<span>That is exactly where I stand. At the intersection between people and businesses. On the one side, through human centered approach putting human needs at the forefront, finding people's desires and wishes, and discovering their aspirations often articulated by latent needs. And on the other side, helping organizations redefine themselves through reconceiving products and services, redefining productivity in the value chain, and building clusters and framework conditions in order to provide real value to the user b</span><span>y solving social problems</span><span>. This is the foundation of long-term capitalism along with the notion of 'shared value'.</span>\n\n<span>This paradigm shift affects all three sectors: public, private and third. Public needs to regulate minimum (high) standards setting the stage for private and third to compete. Even if non-profits still need to emerge as professional organizations (aka social businesses) capable of facing fierce markets, these often already have the appropriate mind-set. Whereas due to their flexibility, companies can create sustainable and scalable solutions to many social problems in ways that governments and NGOs cannot. This is why recent collaborations between multinational corporations (MNCs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have resulted in innovation of disruptive products and services. MNCs and NGOs have very different core 'businesses' which are highly compatible since the first is excellent at doing business and the second has extensive information about the needs of a specific target population.</span>\n\n<span>My idea is to be a facilitator / translator at the center of this triangle, bringing together foundations and CSR departments (for now), non-profits, and ministries. It is the promotion of a greater well-being rather than a single-minded pursuit of growth and profits stimulating a strong sense of community that will generate coopetition (healthy competition) and therefore social innovation. This is the level I found myself to be most profitable, especially in the actual European context filled of opportunities.</span>\n\n<span>Hopefully this is what awaits me at </span><a href=\"http://www.soulsight.es/\" style=\"font-size: 8pt; line-height: 0.17in; \">Soulsight</a><span> \u2013 a strategic design consultancy from Madrid- in which I will start working beginning of April.

Let me get to them straight after I introduce the methodological approach I am following. It is based on\u00a0 <a href=\"http://people.ceu.hu/karin_liebhart\">Karin Liebhart</a> lectures in and I will summarize it here.\n\n1. Preliminary coding. Review transcript (in this case - relative ER groups),\u00a0 discover important aspects in the transcript - aka preliminary codes which can be refined later.\u00a0\n\n1.1 Identify key themes/patterns in respective units of text\n\n1.2 Start sorting these identified themes/ issues/ patterns\n\n2. Develop codes. Codes are a criteria of description, aka words/phrases that serve as labels for sections of data\n\n3. Identify all data relating to these codes, that is extract text that matches specified labels. Codes can be revised during the process.\u00a0\n\n4.\u00a0 Figure out relations between these codes, build clusters/ identify relevant categories\n\n4.1 Identify relations between themes, sub-themes \u2013 how are they linked (for example through causal chains) in the view of the participant of forum discussions?\n\n4.2 Cluster themes, figure out particularly relevant categories\n\n4.3 Search for irritations (the unexpected data/codes that does not follow existing pattern)\n\n4.4 Describe content of categories in detail (back to original text) and find relating examples and quotations\n\n5. Systematic contrasting of cases (in this case - countries: Georgia, Armenia, Egypt)\n\nWhat is here, it is a produce of step 1 and a basis for step 2. Steps 4 and 5 will be done with RQDA after coding all the relative information.\n\nAs you noticed, <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>, there are some codes that probably should be merged under one label (like - app making into coding)\n\nWhat makes code a code? Personally, I love this quote:\n\n\"Just as a title represents and captures a book or film or poem\u2019s primary con-\n\ntent and essence, so does a code represent and capture a datum\u2019s primary\n\ncontent and essence\". <a href=\"http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/24614_01_Saldana_Ch_01.pdf\">(Saldana 2008:3)</a>.\n\nHe continues stressing out that codes are very individual and each researcher would have a personal idea how to arrange the text/extract the appropriate amount of meaning from it:\n\n\"Coding is not a precise science; it\u2019s primarily an interpretive act\".(ibid:4)\n\nHence in this case this is a starting kit of codes that in my opinion capture the meaning of text in the SPF discussions and is on the middle ground between very detailed and very abstract labels. I agree that some of them look more abstract (such as trust) and some more detailed (such as big family) but I will redefine them as I go.\n\nAs to the second question, codes are organized more like umbrella terms for units of meaning in the text, but I guess thesaurus could be considered as a skeleton of this umbrella.\u00a0\n\nIn addition to that, I have a question/suggestion: what about making (a) focus group discussion(s) during the final event? <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>, I think it would be more interesting and more useful for the research than just a feed back on the draft paper as the participants will be the same who participate online and then they could express more in-depth perspective on the issues identified from their talks online.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-22 08:32:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:24.821816", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 619, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 951, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 918, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Last week at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, Edgeryders as project and think tank entered an exciting new phase: for the first time we met face to face with students, youth workers, sociologists, project managers, researchers, CoE staff members and <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/2012/03/and-the-edgeryders-invited-to-strasbourg-are-%E2%80%A6/\">community members</a>. One goal was to discuss where we are with research findings and their potential to elicit better <em>youth policy </em>(a term some of us would like replaced since it most often means policy <em>for </em>youth instead of <em>by </em>youth, hinting at top-down approaches). In addition to the tentative summary below, browsing the \\#edgemeet hashtag archive you'll find statements that IMO shall long live in Edgeryders collective imaginary.\n\n<h3 style=\"color: \\#f15c32;\">Edgeryders implications for policy: A prototype?</h3>\n\nhttps://twitter.com/monsieurgustave/status/180336869832278017\n\nWith over 550 users and roughly 140 high quality stories, ours is a community of citizens experts, built on the assumption that a large crowd of people is smarter than any smaller group of smart people. Edgeryders uses an unconventional methodology that's cheap and fast compared to traditional ethnography, plus it incorporates the digital tools youth are so fond of nowadays. Because of these and more, Edgeryders collaborative model challenges key perspectives in policy design and in <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/2011/10/meet-team-gilda-farrell/\">Gilda Farrell</a>'s words, it can be a prototype for different kind of interactions between institutions and citizens. The issue was brought to discussion at a roundtable on how intergovernmental institutions, namely the Council of Europe, could improve interaction with citizens. Clearly, islands of innovative thinking do exist, but structural transformation will take time.\n\n<blockquote>Francis Gosselin Uni Strasbourg: How do IGOs respond to social media and is there a need for IGOs to do so?\u00a0- @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarukomuC/status/180312526419001344\">MarukomuC</a>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Lee Hibbard: the structures of @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/councilofeurope\">councilofeurope</a> are not enough, we have to be more creative and more lateral in our thinking. -@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/edgeryders/status/180321120342384641\">Edgeryders</a>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Talking expectation management and honesty: if Edgeryders doesn\u2019t turn into miracle policies, that\u2019s fine.

These are real people, with real aspirations and fears, and theirs are honest accounts of offline realities. In Valentina's words, the content so far \"is really pushing the boundaries of the most recent literature on youth transition\", as it brings forward key concepts:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>WHAT Edgeryders talk about, both positive and negative issues: innovation, inspiration, motivation, expression, joy, passion, congratulation; dissapointment, dissatisfaction, failure, protest, inequalities, frustration, risk and others;</li>\n\n<li>HOW they live or face challenges: building networks, searching for funding, accessing the Internet, social hacking, developing skills, shared ownership, contribution.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nhttps://twitter.com/culture_jammer/status/180263065437212673\n\n<h3 style=\"color: \\#f15c32;\">Message from the community</h3>\n\nEach of the four Edgeryders invitees presented a key topic in youth transition, as seen through the eyes of the community: <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/alessia-zabatino\">Alessia</a>'s claim was that Edgeryders challenge the traditional chain of working-to-buy-to-consume-to-die with a new magic chain that puts passion and self-motivation at the heart of work. <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/toolosophy\">Andrei</a> aka @TOOLosophy provided us with a complex tour into the old and new channels of participation: on one side we're witnessing alienation of young people from the rigid political systems, but on the other hand we see models of human agency and grassroots cooperation (the open data movements, but also acts of civil disobedience).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/edgeryders/status/180252489092829184\n\n<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/tiago\">Tiago</a> had a visually beautiful presentation introducing the Edgeryder Innovator Persona, who doesn't fit the formal work requirements and who is told, when in search for funding: \"I am sorry, you are too ahead of your time\". Finally, we heard <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/higiacomo\">Giacomo</a> speaking about the futility of his educational experience - for not fostering networking skills or encouraging initiative, to name just a few arguments - and applauded his quest for bringing happiness into the world :). Are all Edgeryders holding such a fresh outlook on the future? We think most are.

But this particular anthill is under attack. Something is disrupting it \u2013 maybe a predator, or a stream fed by a recent rain. It has taken damage, but\u00a0is far from dead.\n\nIn the center, close to the queen's chambers, activity goes on as normal. You might not notice the threat at all.\u00a0Out in the war zone, it's chaos. Soldiers wander around in headless chicken mode. Many are dead.\u00a0Many more will soon be.\n\nIn a way, we are like that anthill. We have built a complex, successful \u00a0civilization. We have welfare systems\u00a0and Bretton Woods institutions. We have advanced democracy and free, compulsory education. We have market regulators and central banks and human rights and\u00a0knowledge economies. These are no illusion.\u00a0Stand in the London Stock Exchange, or under the Eurotower in Frankfurt, and revel\u00a0in the might of the West.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Yet we are struggling, and\u00a0we might be\u00a0failing</strong>. A many-sided crisis \u00a0\u2013 financial, environmental, ideological, societal \u2013 eats away at our system. We all feel something's not right, and the feeling is strongest\u00a0in the European Union.\u00a0Look at the graduates without a future, leaving <em>en masse</em> Italy and Portugal and Romania. Look at the many Greeks who have <a href=\"/en/opencare/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care\">lost their right to health care</a> along with their jobs. Look at the\u00a0many migrants and refugees seeking to make a new home in Europe, and at Europe being unable to cope. Look at the malcontent, the tensions, the loss of hope.\u00a0\n\nNow take another look at our\u00a0anthill. See? There is no sharp line dividing the two zones. The behaviour of individual ants in the center\u00a0is different from that of their sisters in the war zone: that's obvious. Yet, it is not clear just <em>where</em>\u00a0war\u00a0zone behaviour kicks in. There is a transition zone, where ants are neither at peace nor in chaos. They see\u00a0the threat,\u00a0but they are far enough from immediate danger for panic not to be the only option. They can, and do, try to respond, warn their sisters, coordinate.\u00a0\n\nWelcome to the edge.\u00a0\n\nTransition zones is where most edgeryders live. It is there,\u00a0we believe, you will find\u00a0the key to successful societal adaptation. Why? Simple: because only there do you find both the incentives and the capacity to drive change. <strong>In the center, the \u00e9lites have little incentive to adapt \u2013 they are not on the firing line. In the periphery, the dispossessed have little capacity \u2013 staying afloat is a full time job. But on the edge it makes complete sense to try long-range, radical\u00a0stuff out</strong>. And we do: we try\u00a0co-living, sharing economy, crypto currencies, open source everything and stuff that does not even have a name yet.\u00a0Some of this stuff will succeed and go mainstream, shaping the world to come.\u00a0\n\n<strong>But most, of course, will fail and go extinct</strong>. The edge generates a lot of\u00a0failure: it's just how things work. What if we could turn all that failure into information? What if we made that information into a common resource we all can learn from? There's an opportunity here.\n\nThat\u00a0same sensed\u00a0opportunity drives\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.antiheroes.org/\">Antiheroes</a>, aka\u00a0Irene and Kira. They organize\u00a0Fuckup Nights Bruxelles, where people gather to hear stories of failure\u00a0by the people who did the failing. I attended some of them, and left quite impressed. Stories of failure\u00a0are rich, and drive storyteller and listeners to build alternative worlds. What was the cause of X? What could you have done (but did not do)\u00a0to fix Y? How could you not see Z coming? \u00a0And there is an added bonus:\u00a0you can't talk about failure without being candid. You have to stop pretending you are brilliant and successful and on top of things all the time. <strong>This creates an environment low on hustling and high on truth</strong>. Learning ensues. So does human compassion and fraternity, because \u2013 guess what \u2013 everybody fails.\u00a0\n\nSo, Edgeryders teamed up with Antiheroes to produce our next community event: Living On The Edge 5 \u2013 fail/unFail. It will be community-driven and no-spectators, like earlier LOTEs.\u00a0It will focus on failure, like Fuckup Nights. As always, it will welcome everyone, especially the Edgeryders and Antiheroes communities.\u00a0\n\nLOTE5's program is still in development, but it already lists cutting-edge activities and participants.\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Ezio Manzini, one of\u00a0the\u00a0world's most famous\u00a0service\u00a0designers, leads a workshop on <strong>how to make our own care services</strong>.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>U. N.\u00a0innovation specialist\u00a0Milica Begovic discusses <strong>how new financing models are breaking the development sector</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>Security expert (and science fiction writer!)\u00a0Meredith Patterson lets us in on the arcana of <strong>debt interoperability</strong>.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Data scientist Guy Melan\u00e7on sets up\u00a0<strong>Masters of Networks</strong>,\u00a0a hackathon-like event where we hack networks.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Bob Palmer,\u00a0Europe's top cultural policy expert, reveals <strong>how and why most cultural policies fail</strong>. Expect gory details. To top it all up, Ida Leone, Ilaria D'Auria and Roxana Bedrule\u00a0will explain how\u00a0you can still fail even by succeeding. Exhibit A: Matera, Italy, crowned European Capital of Culture 2019. \u00a0Exhibit B: Bucharest, Romania, shortlisted for European Capital of Culture 2021.</li>\n\n<li>Our own Nadia El-Imam shows us abject <strong>failure \u2013 and a path to unfailure \u2013 in responding to the refugee crisis</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>Mohamed Hegazy builds on top of <strong>Cairo's failure to plan its public transport network</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>John Coate, the legendary WELL community manager, teaches us <strong>how to cope with meltdowns in communities</strong>.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Vinay Gupta, Ethereum release coordinator, lists <strong>failures in finance and contracts</strong>. His path to unFailing: the much rumoured\u00a0blockchain technology.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSee? We'll be failing \u2013 and learning \u2013 in style.\u00a0\n\nMore is coming. Much more, because we all build LOTE5 together, and, as always, no one gets away with being a spectator. New people will show up, and they will bring their wisdom to the\u00a0search, and their energy to the party. Everyone is welcome, and we have work to do for everyone. Give a talk or lead a workshop, help run the kitchen or be our Tweetstar, everyone is important.\u00a0\n\n<strong>What will\u00a0<em>you</em>\u00a0do? We hope you will join us</strong>. Click <a href=\"/t/getting-your-ticket/4915\">here</a> to find out how to.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Update January 21st 2016</strong>. The <a href=\"/t/program/5033\">LOTE5 program</a>\u00a0is still evolving,\u00a0but has already exceeded all expectations. Deep talks, design workshops with Syrian refugee designers, networks hackathons, a guided visit to Europe's alleged jihadi central, a communal kitchen and even a bonfire!

I'm not part of the older generation either.\n\nI am neither a scientist nor a sociologist but I observe the world as it is and I try to have an impact in it.\n\nI am not really a specialist in any particular field. At most, I am a good generalist. What I do is connecting the dots, creating links, bringing well-being in environments in which I try to create value. Some would say I bring resilience.\n\nNot so long ago I had to decide what to put on my business card. I finally combined two ideas, so I wrote <strong>Lean &amp; stereo</strong> contractor/facilitator. Indeed, I had knocked for almost 10 years on the door of the <strong>social economy</strong>, which has become <strong>social entrepreneurship</strong> and which continues to mutate to meet the demands of markets that do not raise the interest of the private sector but that are neither big enough for the public. The third which often has grassroot origins.\n\nThe testimony I would like to make is that of front-line actors for whom the world is full of opportunities and who humbly seek to be an <strong>actor of change</strong> at a time when everything is accelerating.\n\nThe values \u200b\u200bthat I carry and tried to synthesize in my business card are those of agile actors. Lean means going through iterations before setting-up a comprehensive plan and establishing a strategy. The concept of stereo relates to the progress made in the world of 3D capture. Virtual Reality (VR) has a lot of facets including stereoscopy, which has existed since the film era.\n\nBack to Care Change, I have always had the feeling of being able to change the things surrounding me. The challenge is to see if I could <strong>scale-up</strong> and bring this change to a larger environment. It has been a year now since I have been able to free myself from the stress of working on a project, for a boss and a structure. I work today to find projects in which I have the <strong>leverage</strong> to validate assumptions while bringing intrinsic value to the holders of such projects.\n\nMy approach is pretty simple. The assumptions I want to validate are always more or less similar. As a citizen and practitioner I am able to describe and initiate a project to make it readable for an environment at the crossroads of 3 areas: the <strong>Private Sector (PS), the Powers public and the World Philanthropy (MP)</strong>\n\nToday what I thought was possible, what I long sought to <strong>free myself from -the stress-</strong> seems accessible, so I want others to find their space of expression. I work to make this state of mind possible every day. Today I can choose the missions in which I want to invest time, so I have found a balance, albeit fragile, that allows me to concentrate in <strong>making the World</strong> as I imagined.\n\nI am not telling the story of a guy who left his job because he was <strong>burnt out </strong>or the story of a guy who had enough of his life in the private sector. I will not tell the story of the <strong>social worker</strong> exhausted by a heavy administrative and institutional burden. The story of a guy who, day after day, limited the capacity of the frontline actor tired of solving everyday problems and not recognizing that it was <strong>social action</strong> fueling those resources. Make sense.\n\nThis is to deliver the testimony of a player who can move from one side of the mirror to the other. Who moves from the private to the public just to <strong>give meaning to his quest</strong>.\n\nThe work experience and job sequence that I want to share takes place in the days when I worked with a broker specialized in construction insurance. I was managing customer records. We worked 40 hours a week but had the right to an extra day off per month. Which made a total of 12 days per year.\n\nThis broker job was clearly outside my reflection area but allowed a true stability and <strong>switch</strong> to the private sector.\n\n<strong>12 days</strong> to take a leave or to invest in something that made sense. So I had the opportunity to participate in the first edition of the <strong>Belgian Ashoka Impact Program</strong> (www.belgium.ashoka.org/programme-impact). I became the coach of a project that was already present in France, Spain and Ireland. The <strong>Associative Group Siel Bleu</strong> (www.sielbleu.org) is an organization that offers <strong>Adapted Physical Activity</strong> (APA) to seniors. The project I was in charge of was called <strong>Gymsana</strong> in Belgium (www.gymsana.be).\n\nWe were the winners of the Impact Programme 2013. The aim of the program was to change the scale of 12 projects through a program of 3 months.\n\nMy mission was focused on the <strong>working process</strong> to streamline the activities of this programme in Belgium. The model copy/pasted the mode of development practiced in France in other APAs. Siel Bleu had <strong>teaching and training materials</strong> available to us. But the difficulties in Belgium came from <strong>plural sources of funding</strong> and the <strong>complexity to articulate a coherent budget</strong> in the 3 regions of the country.\n\nSiel Bleu made its mark and became an <strong>Ashoka Fellow</strong> thanks to its ability to offer <strong>measurable impact</strong> of the activities that stakeholders were proposing. I discovered the rating of Social Return on Investment (SROI) and the inspiration of Fellows, who were <strong>ambassadors for change</strong> and <strong>storytellers</strong> capable to <strong>trigger the adhesion</strong> of other <strong>stakeholders </strong>to the project. This scientific validation early became the highlight of Siel Bleu and APA quickly convinced the European authorities and the French commissioner Michel Barnier. The Group has experienced a <strong>strong growth</strong> and has little by little gained respect thanks to its ability to offer an alternative to current standards of care of the elderly. Mainly for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's. But also for type 2 diabetes.\n\nThroughout my rather rich career, I learned in Les <strong>Petits Riens</strong> (www.petitsriens.be), a Belgian non-profit organization that fights against poverty and exclusion by <strong>providing value to second hand goods</strong> in order to <strong>create economic activity</strong> and <strong>finance social actions</strong>. At Gymsana I understood how to build speeches and tools for impact and offer <strong>innovative and disruptive solutions</strong> over existing standards.\n\nDuring the <strong>transition phase</strong> which settles and throughout a <strong>period of 20-30 years</strong>, I will have the opportunity to witness the transfer of an associative model starting at <strong>local grassroot initiatives</strong>, towards <strong>integration companies</strong> in search of a model less dependent on public funding: the social economy. I have seen the sector evolve with the emergence of <strong>social entrepreneurs</strong> now called <strong>ChangeMakers</strong>. They are capable of measuring the impact of efforts on topics of interest with <strong>value propositions </strong>ever more innovative. And today I am involved in a project that may be a <strong>Makestorming in 2017</strong>, a <strong>Brussels FabLabs Network (RBF)</strong> which aims to reclaim <strong>capacity changes</strong> with <strong>digital support</strong>, either <strong>Soft or Hardware</strong>. The <strong>OpenSource</strong> nourishes the hope of individuals to associate and MAKE. Make community, make sense, know how.\n\nIf a <strong>paradigm shift</strong> is possible is because individuals set the path. This transition is more fluid today thanks to the <strong>flux of information</strong> and initiatives that tend to liberate innovation for the <strong>Common</strong>. <strong>Propriety licenses</strong>, which hitherto created value not for the common good but primarily for the private interest, shatter today. A generation now <strong>organizes</strong> to make the creation of <strong>common property among peers</strong> possible. Michel Bauwens, a Belgian citizen, may certainly be recognized as a theorist of this movement for the emancipation of the current model. And <strong>FabLabs</strong> like <strong>BioHackerspace</strong> are probably places where ChangeMakers have access to the tools that move the lines.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-28 06:46:13", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 16:12:53.150182", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1464, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4570, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4537, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong style=\"line-height: 21.6363620758057px;\">Future Makers is a\u00a0<a href=\"/t/draft-new-book-on-networked-collaboration/4516\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">collaboratively produced book</a>\u00a0of case studies</strong><strong style=\"line-height: 21.6363620758057px;\"> </strong><strong style=\"line-height: 21.6363620758057px;\">[add brief summary of what case studies are about here]</strong><strong style=\"line-height: 21.6363620758057px;\"> </strong><strong style=\"line-height: 21.6363620758057px;\">with analysis and graphics</strong><span>.

Invest in digital technologies for the social good: Make it easier to create new DSI through specific regulatory and funding measures that focus on supporting non-institutional actors driving innovation in the following areas: the collaborative economy, cities and public services; open tools and distributed architectures; and citizen engagement and direct democracy.\n\n<i>I think, as you say, this is liable to (further) perpetuate the pervasive ideological hegemony where 'technological innovation as panacea' (for unsustainable/unequal/large corporate 'economic growth') is concerned. I also agree that a far greater emphasis needs to be placed upon ETHICS (what is meant by 'social good' - who gets to decide?) and MISSION (what do we want to leverage technology to actually achieve - intended outcomes (before 'engineered' method)?). Our own work to support the establishment of <a href=\"http://commonfutures.eu/open-network-pioneers-digital-merthyr/\">open networks underpinned by collaborative consumption of internet bandwidth in South Wales</a>, </i><i>as well as to explore the scope to design and prototype <a href=\"http://ourdata.coop/\">Data Coops</a>, points to both as being largely 'missing in action' re the 'open networks' and 'open data' agendas at present.\u00a0</i>\n\n<em>I think the reference to 'regulatory measures' is particularly interesting - and, noteworthy in this regard, are ongoing discussions surrounding 'frameworks' in relation to the sharing economy, <a href=\"http://www.ubiquitouscommons.org/\">Ubiquitous Commons</a>, EU copyright reform, EU State Aid provisions (re telecommunications infrastructure) - because, like you, I agree there is a LONG way to go where the legal catch-up effort and technology is concerned; we have legal provisions that are designed for geographically bounded (tangible) territories, when what we need ASAP are 'quantum legals' to empower and protect 'bytes of me all over time and space'.\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>I also think your point about tangible assets is worthwhile exploring in greater depth. There is growing interest in the commonifcation of publicly owned assets and services (in Bologna as well as in the UK - see: @reinikainen and @simonfparker) and, with that, in 'wild flower meadows over monocultures' in respect of tangible asset ownership and management for social good - or, for want of a better term, 'anarcho-localism'. But, something different - perhaps, a form of 'anarcho-syndicalism', if an analogy is sought without any political perspective intended - is urgently required where digital assets and distributed architectures are concerned. Otherwise, I fear, (1) will continue to operate solely in the interests of capital...rather than for citizens/workers/consumers, etc.\u00a0</em>\n\n2. Make it easier to grow and spread DSI through public procurement: Provide support for evidence generation, common standards and integration with public services. Focus on the financial as well as the social impact (such as health outcomes, wellbeing etc.) when procuring services. Particularly for DSI this could include valuing the network effect and digital engagement of users provided by procured services.\n\n<em>I think a debate is called for to explore the extent to which DSI can sensibly be 'procured' by the public sector...the aim perhaps ought to be to disrupt procurement through/for DSI? Otherwise, I wonder whether we might want to stimulate a discussion about deploying a proportion of taxation differently to bring about an 'R&amp;D Government' policy/programme intervention? If R&amp;D (innovation) is about exploring unknowns/taking risks/disruption...to what extent can it also be about 'evidence of what <strong>already</strong> works', '<strong>common</strong> standards' and 'integration with <strong>existing</strong> public services'?\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>On Social Value &amp; Procurement - I think it is worthwhile noting: Lord Young's recently published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/403748/Social_Value_Act_review_report_150212.pdf\">Review of the UK's Social Value Act</a>, and Locality's <a href=\"http://locality.org.uk/blog/work-encourage-commissioners-social-creatively/\">response</a>\u00a0re assets/services (NB: in TANGIBLE locations/contexts). And, on valuing the network effect ... well, I think we're all agreed that the drive towards datafication and, related to that, commodification of the quantified self/community are...dangerous (back to my comments re [1]). </em>\n\n<em>But, crucially, I think we need to question: how does measuring 'digital engagement' re procured DSI services make sense/add value WITHOUT our first underlining that 'digital public services' function in gated (private sector operated/controlled) communities from which those most in need and reliant upon public services are - disproportionately - prevented from entering?! Where is the policy recommendation in all of this about how to address inequality perpetuated by technological idealism?</em>\n\n3. Increase the potential value of DSI (for instance, making available distributed architectures, common frameworks, open standards and through supporting Innovation Spaces). Overall, there is a need for a public, common framework for the design of DSI solutions and infrastructures underpinned by open protocols, open standards, open formats, regulatory mechanisms and collective governance models based on democratic and participatory processes. New financial instruments (such as crowdfunding, challenges and prizes) should be experimented with through R&amp;D funding, while support to Innovation Spaces (such as Fab Labs, hackerspaces and makerspaces) should be increased.\n\n<em>This is, for me, more of the same - the 'open' mantra trumps the 'ethical/mission-driven' deployment of technology debate. And, as you say, where is the emphasis - NOT on financial instruments in support of capital but on sustainability and the democratic/participatory engagement of citizens/workers/consumers in this world of DSI?</em>\n\n4. Enable some of the radical and disruptive innovations emerging from DSI \u2013 such as new approaches to money, consumption, democracy, education and health \u2013 to thrive: Policymakers need to provide space for more radical ideas to be tested out in towns and cities across Europe, using knowledge about how systemic innovation can best be organised. In some cases substantial investment will be needed to achieve this.\n\n<em>Interesting - reads back to my comments on procurement but...if you took a tangible assets analogy and considered spatial '<strong>zoning</strong>' and/or '<strong>exception</strong> sites', could it make sense to call for the development of kindred provisions where intangible assets and virtual networks/communities (here, DSI platforms) are concerned? In particular, were they 'locked' for mission/purpose - i.e. bona fide 'social good' - or, in some instances, members (cooperative fashion). I think exemptions from EU 'state aid' and 'procurement' provisions would be particularly helpful...but, others with a more detailed knowledge might add: IP/Patent and Copyright provisions - as a starter for ten?</em>\n\n5. Expand the European DSI network and invest in the development of skills, and training: This could be done through growing the digitalsocial.eu network to enable more opportunities for collaboration; increasing early stage seed-funding programmes and other types of non-financial support for DSI start-ups; supporting programmes that help people and organisations working on social innovation develop their digital skills; and building DSI capacity in Eastern Europe by facilitating collaboration between established DSI networks and organisations from the rest of the EU.\n\n<em>So, more funding for existing institutions and DSI infrastructure...accelerators/hubs/labs (that, all too often, fail to adequately compensate those commoners involved and, with that, exacerbate their precariousness)...and, unhelpfully, from my perspective, nothing here for ALT platforms/networks and/or to promote (serious) digital literacy where rights/responsibilities are concerned amongst EU Citizens themselves.\u00a0</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-25 15:02:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:53.779418", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1321, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 16.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32776, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4918, "post_number": 34, "raw": "<b>Appreciated!</b>\n\nThanks team WeMake!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-10 07:49:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:59.942105", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32756], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 730, "user_id": 3394, "topic_id": 697, "post_number": 1, "raw": "In the center of Thessaloniki, Maria and Iordanis have established a spiritual center in order to foster spiritual knowledge, exchange of personal experiences and ideas and philanthropic actions for humanitarian relief of poor families. Knowledge &amp; Inspiration offers space for personal development and collective knowledge. Its main objective is to bring together people with different backgrounds (educational, economic and spiritual) who share an interest in spirituality, self-improvement, and accomplishment through seminars, interaction with community members and substantive contribution to needy people.\n\nThe initiative consists of 12 core members, most of them in their early thirties and 20 families in the voluntary program of daily food provision. These beneficiaries are active in the program until they overcome poverty, unemployment, and malnutrition.\n\nThe project does not aim to attract the attention of the press and this is the main reason that Knowledge &amp; Inspiration has no\u00a0virtual presence on social media and Internet in general. For the past 7 years, the community contributes its best, offering good practices inspiring the good will of residents of Thessaloniki and local businesses who encourage and support its efforts.\n\n<strong>The people behind the idea</strong>\n\nKnowledge &amp; Inspiration is an original idea of Maria Georgiou and her husband, Iordanis (who is no longer alive). The initial idea came 7 years ago, after a spiritual experience while traveling in India and meeting with the Indian guru and philanthropist Sathya Sai Baba. When we returned to Greece,we decided to become volunteers in regular service activities such as giving food to the needy, cooperate with NGOs in order to provide medical services, and other forms of civic volunteerism.\n\nNowadays, Maria focuses on 1) self-improvement and 2) community service with the support of Knowledge &amp; Inspiration community members on the basis of shared identity, commitment and common practice. Maria\u2019s driving motivation is on spiritual level, without making daily plans. All these years, she has discovered abilities that she was not aware of. She and her husband used to live fully in materialism, until the moment they landed in India for first time. \u201cIt was a radical transformation from a material to a spiritual life\u201d, she says. It was a miracle that helped both of them overcome personal and objective obstacles in their lives.\n\nKnowledge &amp; Inspiration is the work of Maria and her volunteers, who are usually busy with tasks related to the community such as food collection, education, humanitarian relief and collective cohesion. When Maria is not running community projects, she participates in colleagues\u2019 seminars and meditates every day. \u201cIt\u2019s my way of living\u201d, she says.\n\n<strong>Who benefits from Knowledge and Inspiration?</strong>\n\nKnowledge &amp; Inspiration is an open community without specific target groups. The audience is distributed as follows:\n\n1. General population who is interested in self-improvement, accomplishment and belonging to a community.\n\n2. Poor families of Thessaloniki coping with economic hardships.\n\n3. Fellow tutors of spirituality or therapeutic practitioners for mental or physical healing.\n\n<strong>Future Plans</strong>\n\nMaria\u2019s personal goal and vision are to create\u00a0an \u201cAshram\u201d in a rural area. The inspiration for choosing the ideal location stems from the need of a place combining adult and children education on human values, a community kitchen, organic farming, connection with nature, spiritual guidance, networking with spiritual teachers and gurus, hospitality for visitors and people in need in the context of volunteerism, community service, healthcare (physical and mental) and humanitarian relief. It is an ambitious idea inspired by Sathya Sai Baba\u2019s philanthropic action connecting in this way spirituality with selfless giving.\n\nIn Thessaloniki, Maria plans to extend the educational programs including meditation, alternative therapeutic techniques such as Reiki, all of them performed by volunteers except the active classes for self-improvement, guidance for new parents and yoga lessons.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-03 12:06:26", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 16:11:46.229770", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 689, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 61.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 770, "user_id": 3448, "topic_id": 737, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Idea is about helping blind people about the outside world\u2019s obsticles.

Now there's a feeling that they're not alone in their work and that they can provide support and resources to one another in a different way, using what they have rather than relying only on traditional donor models.</span>\n\n<span>Eric was initially sceptical of Edgeryders due to having seen many 'parachute projects' in the past that claimed to have a mystical platform which would unite or create communities, but Edgeryders is different - it doesn't promise anything but instead provides a useful medium which people can springboard off, which makes him more optimistic.</span>\n\n<strong>What you can do to help:</strong>\n\nI<span>nformation exchange - it's a form of affirmation that they're not alone in what they're doing. In Georgia people often reinvent the wheel, but it's because they feel alone, or they don't know that there are others out there doing similar things. It's useful to havce a mechanism which brings people together around common causes because they benefit from the support and the collective information which may otherwise elude them.</span>\n\n<span>Are you or someone you know working in open data or technical approaches to problem solving? check out the projects on <a href=\"http://www.jumpstart.ge\">jumpstart.ge</a> and get in touch with <a href=\"/user/5634\">@ericnbarrett</a> here on the platform to see if you can help each other out.</span>\n\n<span>We're also pitching in pledges to buy a small drone for Jumpstart, so that they can effectively create aerial imagery of Georgia over time, and provide the community with this dataset and the tools you need to work with it. When we have a link, we'll post it here.</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-18 15:36:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:15.217577", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 751, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 50.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28663, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3470, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Hang in there</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/jamesl\">@JamesL</a>, I will be online starting Tuesday and will get a lot more involved with this.

But unfortunately we live in a society that practices brainwashing on a massive scale and with genocidal intent. We should extend the anthropocentric concept of genocide to include the entire planet as a subject liable for genocide, because our current society with its practices not only commits extreme violence against the human race in general, but also against the entire planet. The genocide practiced against the human race could be characterized as primarily mental, as it seeks to destroy any semblance of critical thinking in order to convert us in docile \u201cproductive-consumers\u201d; but it doesn't rule out physical genocide, which often precedes the mental violence and paves its way, but also insidiously infiltrates our daily lives through pollution, consumer products harmful to health, stimulating lifestyles incompatible with health, etc... And against the planet, I suppose that by now should be pretty clear to us the kind of violence with which we treating the planet, because otherwise we would not be talking about ecological crisis.\n\nIn short, today we live in a social and ecological crisis, because since birth, our education system, and the propaganda that continually bombards us taking advantage of any advance in technology, and the examples we receive daily, etc.., they all are conditioning us to act disrespectful with ourselves, with others, and with the planet.\n\nFor example, it is disrespectful to yourself wasting most of your free time eating chips and watching the empty? Here, I guess people will start to speak about personal freedom and that everyone has the right to choose what to do with her/his free time. That is partially true, and this partiality -playing with half-truths- is the greatest hoax of our current society: to make us believe that we have a system where we are free to choose, and that whatever we do against it, is going against our freedom. So, it is partially true, cause it is true that we must have freedom about what to do in our time \u2013 as long as we are not damaging the freedom of others -. So, if I want to eat chips and watch the empty all my time, it must be OK. But it is also false, cause to choose freely you must have the adequate knowledge to see and evaluate the various possible alternatives, and must have the appropriate context to implement the best alternative. And in our society can not choose freely, because from birth we are brainwashed by telling us that eating chips and watching the empty is the good, and also we don't have the proper context, because when I'm arriving from work after an exhausting day, that is the easiest course of action - kindly offered by a system designed for that -. So, what happens in the end, most of us are ending up eating chips and watching the empty in our free time because we were trained to do that, and because we do not have the necessary context to make something better. And so, finally we are ending up being disrespectful to ourselves, because we do not use our time \u2013 the only thing that we really have - consciously.\n\nFor example, it is disrespectful to ask others to use the best part of their days to do a certain job, neglecting the cultivation of their personal, family and interpersonal sides? To put it simply, here I'm not questioning the meaning of their jobs, because we could fill many pages talking about the countless people forced to do meaningless work (I was questioning that a bit <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/tale-about-basic-human-decency#comment-3202\">here</a>). No, let's talk about something \u201csimpler\u201d, again about time. And here, I have one question, who was the person who decided that the workday must be 8 hours (at least), and also must be at the best part of the day? As far I know, as people living in a society, we have to do some productive contribution to it, this seems to be logical, ultimately we cannot hope to do nothing and live from miracles. But as human beings, supposedly owners of our own time, we also have the right to cultivate our personal interests, our families and our interpersonal relationships (the social part outside family). Today it is fashionable to talk about work-life balance, but its departing from a false premise (*), since beforehand is not questioning the right of the work to occupy a third -at least (**) - of our day. Why the work is more important than all the rest and has such prominence? Why not work should not occupy at most a fifth of our time? 8 hours for resting, 4 for personal (sports, hobbies, etc.), 4 for family (romantic relationship, growing children, etc.), 4 for the interpersonal (community service, talking with friends, etc..), and 4 for work. You could say that I am free to organize my time as I want. That if I really want (or a similar discourse of self-help) I would be able to find a lifestyle where I can get for example the previous balance. Really I have that freedom? I'm conditioned to believe that 8 hours working is the normal and the whole system is structured for that - that means that most jobs are offering that and not another option -. Therefore, I'm rarely discussing the right to work less than 8 hours and still living with dignity, and if I do that, I will hardly find a job where I can work less than 8 hours and live with dignity. And if I'm lucky and I'm getting it, then it is a certainty that this situation is beyond the reach of most of us, simply because the system is not structured for that. Now suppose that not only I want to work less than 8 hours, but also I want to have a family with children. Probably, again you will tell me that this is a personal decision, and that it is my problem if I'm deciding getting myself into such a mess. And yes, you're right, it's my personal decision, but that decision is of crucial importance for all the society. We are needing new people to assure the future of the society, thus for example, at the medium term, we are needing new people to take care of us when we are getting old. So, these people who are taking this personal decision in fact is also working for all of us, because we definitely are needing the new generations. That is, having a family it I not only a personal decision that is consistent with the interests of a particular person, it is also a decision that affects the future of our society. But what do we do as a society about that decision? It is your individual decision, it is your particular problem, so I have nothing to do regard such decision; therefore, you must work eight (or more) hours and you will earn the same as any other, and after working at your spare time, you must resolve your \u201cproblem\u201d you alone. And actually, I have a reasonable probability of contradicting that? That is, I'm free to choose? Well, I am free to work more or not having family, cause in fact that is the way that our society is showing me. But I am not free for example to work less and spend more time with my family, because despite the importance of this task, we are conditioned to think that the most important thing is work - no matter that the speech perhaps says no, what matters is the amount of time we must spend at work -. And if for some reason I am free of this mental conditioning, the system simply is not structured so you are able to work less and spend more time with your family. Maybe some of us are able to do that, but definitely not all of us. And so, finally we are ending up being disrespectful with the others, because not only we are not recognizing the activity they are doing for us (***), but we also are denying them the possibility to do this activity in the best way.\n\nSo if the real question is how to avoid the brainwashing, the answer is that it is too late, because we are being brainwashed in one way or another from cradle to grave. Because we are in a society that tells us that we are free to choose whatever we want, and we can have everything we want, and that we can be even rich. When the truth is that we are being brainwashed through the word \u201cfreedom\u201d and half-truths. Because the truth is that we cannot choose whatever we want, we can not have everything we want, and we cannot be all rich. To begin, there is insufficient material resources so we all can have everything we want, and even less we all can be rich, that is just a mirage - or just the carrot that motivates the donkey -. , and for this reason we need temperance. We also cannot choose whatever we want, because when we are deciding to live in society, we are accepting to play with the rules of that society \u2013 where those rules are also called values -. And those rules (values) are ultimately determining the kind of society we all have. Therefore, if we want a more fairer society, we must have fairer rules. For example, it is not the same a society where my word is enough to make safe a deal, that another where we are needing a legion of lawyers and controls \u2013 and not event that is enough as is shown in the current financial crisis -. So what we are needing are fairer rules (values), as for example the the \u201csimple\u201d rule of keeping one's word. But that can not be imposed from outside, that has to grow from the intimate conviction of the individual person (and call to this development, personal change or whatever else). And it cannot be imposed from outside, first, because it does not respect individual freedom, cause if a whole group voluntarily decides to follow a set of rules, I can not come and force them to follow my rules because I'm considering that my rules are better. At most I can teach them, and I can show by example that my rules are working better. Second, because for such a change to a more fairer society really works, you must feel it, cause in the opposite we will be always looking for ways to avoid our responsibility. And for that is why I was saying that the first thing is to develop trust in ourselves, cause that means I'm feeling the need to follow those fairer rules. So do not be afraid and think about sects when I'm talking about values. I'm just talking about fairer rules. And to start to follow those fairer rules in our current society for sure we are needing discipline, perseverance and courage, cause they are not coming for free.\n\nSo if we want to change our society to a fairer society, we must change its rules to fairer rules, and to change its rules we must individually develop the conviction that fairer rules are needed and develop the commitment to find those rules and follow those rules (and again, call this development, personal change or whatever else). And imposing that from above is not a successful recipe for that, not at least to establish a fairer society. And for that is why I was talking of a change initiated from the bottom-up. People with the same ideals coming together to collaborate and implement projects that are giving life to these ideals. Projects that are a way to find better rules, and that through their implementation these projects are serving as teaching tools by example (a proof that this rules are better), and themselves also changing the society through their actions. This is the procedure, only a way of looking for better rules and propagate them from the bottom-up, because we must be careful with the messiahs that are coming with the perfect solution ready to implement from the top-down, cause they are knowing better than anybody how the world is working.\n\nAnd at the weekend I'm answering to Noemi and writing about one of these projects designed to look for better rules and at the same time improve the society through its own working. Cause was through the discussion of this project that we arrive at the \u201cLiving together\u201d session to this three words: trust, bottom-up and balance.\n\nSo, yes, we definitely are not needing more brainwashing, cause we are having enough right now. But for sure we are needing a lot of braincleaning, to clean ourselves of all this conditioning that we all have inside us.\n\n\u00a0\n\n(*) We could also discuss the purpose of this talk, because usually what it seeks is to improve productivity, not the worker's life. You can say it does not matter much, because at the end the worker's life is improved. But I can argue that matters a lot, cause if the center of the talk is not the worker's life, in the case that tomorrow we are finding a way to improve productivity at the expense of worker's life, this new way will be implemented and we'll be forgetting the talk about work-life balance.\u00a0We could also discuss about the name \u201cwork-life\u201d, cause isn't work part of the life? Interestingly, work is seen as out of life, and probably that partly has to do with the nonsense of many jobs.\n\n(**) If you deduct up 8 hours from rest, then work is accounting by half the conscious day. Even worse, the stress conditions of many jobs, it is translating that stress to the rest of the day.\n\n(***) It should be considered as a work, or if not work (to avoid trivializing something so important), at least as important as the work.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-29 19:24:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:02.610338", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2506, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17591], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14541, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 5378, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Hi,\u00a0\n\nCould I also be granted access to the links you posted above?\n\nThanks,\u00a0\n\nLuce\n\nPS: is it possible to change the University of Bordeaux link on the Op3ncare platform ?

I moved here because I wanted to become a social entrepreneur, and the high cost of living in Western Europe would have not allowed me to easily undertake this career shift. Furthermore, Ruxandra, my wife and business partner is originally from Bucharest, thus Romania offered us a friendly environment with several people that we could rely upon. My social enterprise is called <a href=\"http://www.babele.co\">Babele</a> (already <a href=\"/t/we-are-all-together-working-slowly-but-surely-for-a-new-paradigm-we-just-need-vision-patience-perseverance-and-collaboration/4125\">on Edgeryders</a>), and consists of open-sourcing the business strategy of social entrepreneurs in order to tap into the collective intelligence of the crowd to improve and scale projects with the potential to tackle the most urgent challenges of our time. In order to develop a meaningful solution, we have validated the concept by holding collaborative business workshops and crowd-mentoring programs in 14 countries, training over 500 entrepreneurs between Europe and Asia.\n\n<img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/OlRqvJKEZ6q6jWw-A_CcyJMIFFtdLDr42PNeINKDVL5uAQX3qhY2Ibo_o-jQ5KpzVD8oull0vRyjczxv-t-Obra1Ec_E28nR8FEZhecrzAa_-8--JxpE3ISO7KZG8bhA2U-BBGc\">\n\nThis project challenges the principle of the Homo Economicus - the center of the liberal philosophy today - which sees society as the sum of rational, individual interests. A profit &amp; loss account mentality has spread from companies to individuals who maximize their short-term economic return while losing sight of the things that are truly important and makes them humans, such as tenderness, understanding, calm and community.\n\nThe anthropological pessimism is a construct of the 17th century that makes no sense today. The human nature is not purely based on competition and individualism, and in a period of scarcity, such as the one that we are living today, we can certainly achieve a better outcome if we see one another as partners sharing the same small and fragile planet\n\nThe 1992 Rio Earth Summit was the moment when sustainable development captured worldwide attention. It established \u00a0why it is necessary to develop solutions that achieve the triple bottom line of economic prosperity, environmental quality and social equity, meeting the needs of present society without compromising resources for future generations. The challenge now is how to execute it, and unless we adopt a collaborative approach, we might never win this challenge.\n\n<strong>Something great is already happening. \u00a0</strong>\n\nAll over the world I see a multitude of people coming together to work on projects with the potential to change the status quo: innovative educational programs, shared gardens, co-housing initiatives, sustainable transportation, circular economy, financial services for the Bottom of the Pyramid, etc.\n\nSeveral of these initiatives are already changing the lives of millions at a local level, despite the fact that they are often not viable economically. They generate positive externalities, that benefit society in several ways but often these benefits are not providing a return for the innovators themselves. As an example, Selaron, the artist who made the colorful staircase in the center of Rio De Janeiro, transformed a dangerous and uninteresting area of the city into one of the major attractions for tourists visiting Brazil. He eventually died poor, as he could not claim any intellectual property over a public space, but this was never the point: Selaron\u2019s drive was not economic but rather the desire to do good for his neighborhood. Another interesting example of non-viable civic initiative are the <a href=\"http://www.velib.paris/\">Velibs</a> in Paris. The Velibs are a system of public bicycles in Paris which revenues only cover 1/10th of the costs encountered to run the service. However, the benefits are indisputable: reduced traffic congestion and Co2 emissions, healthier and happier citizens.\n\nSocial innovations happen in various forms and through the interaction of a multitude of actors. Builders and entrepreneurs are just the tip of the iceberg. Change today is happening thanks to the tireless work of networkers, nurturers, investigators, communicators and resisters, who together create pressure to keep questioning things and mobilize to bring new solutions.\n\n<img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mxruNIDPR1VyUwWLgW178EWkQjMW9mBef273l3oG7rYfDrg1stXuJlpcvMWDLB_tyTAfresgj9Xa-BeOOeTE3Zi13KxkTMXhLy91fKpmA0wBmLqfe-u7v3GdKAjEN_LN6Qjyfxo\">\n\n<em>Source: http://storyofstuff.org/uncategorized/changemaker-types/</em>\n\nA great example to understand the value brought by this diverse network of individuals, is the free trade agreement between the European Union and the United States, also known as TTIP. Citizens from all-over Europe are contributing to bring transparency to this topic, thanks to the work of investigators and communicators, they are ensuring that more people are aware of the trade terms, thanks to the work of networkers and protesters, and are engaging society into a healthy debate, thanks to the work of Nurturers.\n\nAll these actors are key to accelerate change.\n\nHowever, social innovation remains a niche, as mainstream media do not rise sufficient awareness on these topics. Instead, they keep us distracted, confused and a bit intimidated, unable to understand ourselves and without the will to alter political reality. Our televisions are inundated with fiction stories about a world in continuous danger from alien attacks and epidemics while the real calamities of our world remain unattended. As a result, the majority of our society ends up ignoring the real priorities and settle for desires manufactured for us by corporations, without any interest in our true welfare.\n\nThe result of deviating mass attention toward more frivolous topics is observable in the economics of the social innovation market today, which is still a derisive fraction compared to, for instance, the derivatives market that caused the economic crisis in 2008.\n\nIn my experience, a worthy social innovation is happening in Vuollerim, a very small village of 800 inhabitants located in the middle of Lapland (Sweden).\n\n<img alt=\"Polcirkeln_Vuollerim_LaplandVuollerim2.jpg\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/09lq7nWsEZMDjud5BK5KJ6_sUcExjtp8F2b0GDGXAQ8WNTeKj53OoBXVWKZBTDWE35aMrjOBBslE276Mffh3HTa4o5NjJ8exTNL8JLJZJi5JGUYt6D2c_8-1nM7LZJurPzOERfo\">\n\nThe people of Vuollerim have come together and worked on a new welfare system which involves citizens in first person, embraces entrepreneurship and taking initiative and is based on collaborating for the common good rather than focusing on individual benefits. Together, they have created and co-own a multi-function store, a year-round open hotel, a small school, and even a business incubator to develop unique, locally anchored, sustainable enterprises. They are the living example of the \u2018individually we are a drop, together we are an ocean\u2019 philosophy.\n\n<strong>And what about Romania?</strong>\n\nI find that Bucharest is hosting a very active hipster movement with very progressive political views, and is also a place where several innovative projects are coming to life - from shared gardens (<a href=\"http://gradiniurbanecomunitare.intranzitie.org/\">gradini urban</a>e) to up-cycling ads banners into bags and wallets (<a href=\"http://atelierefarafrontiere.ro/remesh-socialware/\">Remesh</a> and <a href=\"http://upside-down.ro/\">upside-down</a>), as well as recycling used cooking oil into bio-diesel (<a href=\"http://www.uleiosul.com/\">Uleiosul</a>). However, despite the motivation and excellent execution of these innovators, for such initiatives to succeed, Bucharest still lacks a solid support ecosystem that can accelerate change and make it more collaborative. The large majority of the population ignores the existence of these initiatives, because we need more networkers, nurturers, investigators, communicators and resisters that can help social change gain momentum.\n\nI am really looking forward to attend the<a href=\"https://goo.gl/ps75fM\"> Futurespotters workshop</a> because I believe it will be a great occasion to mobilize more people to embrace the global movement for change that both Babele and EdgeRyders are nurturing and promoting. Finally, I would be delighted to propose a session on social strategy to help initiatives consider the key aspects that can make them successful.\n\nSo, how are you contributing to change things for the better?

Avec une connection internet ou juste un pc, il sera alors possible de reproduire le mod\u00e8le en l'adaptant aux sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9s locales pour le partager, enrichissant le mod\u00e8le de base.\n\nJe vois le projet comme un commercial ou un manager, je suis tr\u00e8s perfectionniste et j'essaie d'aborder cette id\u00e9e \u00a0sous un maximum d'angles possibles. Mon ami est plus manuel et a une approche pratique. Mais nous sommes parvenus \u00e0 faire correspondre nos points de vue et nos approches, nos raisonnements.\n\nNous sommes assez proches d'un mod\u00e8le pertinent, et nous allons bient\u00f4t le formuler afin de le confronter \u00e0 d'autres vues.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCe qu'il y avait d'int\u00e9ressant avec le mysticisme, c'est que \u00e7a validait ce projet de mani\u00e8re intrigante.\n\nMais ce n'est pas du tout l'approche que nous avons. Il s'agit de cr\u00e9er un endroit o\u00f9 chacun peut trouver sa place et a le m\u00eame acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des connaissances et des savoir-faire, des moyens de production pour les appliquer et exp\u00e9rimenter. Un endroit qui encourage la curiosit\u00e9 et le m\u00e9lange des cultures.\n\nLe but n'est pas de cr\u00e9er une utopie ou quoi que ce soit. C'est une exp\u00e9rience open source : on place des personnes d'univers diff\u00e9rents ensemble avec les moyens de partager leurs passions. Il faut de tout pour faire un monde. Des intellectuels, des manuels, des artistes rassembl\u00e9s pour construire un meilleur monde.\n\nL'id\u00e9e me vient et me fait sourire, mais on peut aussi en faire une \u00e9mission de t\u00e9l\u00e9-r\u00e9alit\u00e9...\n\nTr\u00eave de galigeades, plut\u00f4t que de mysticisme, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re parler d'\u00e9veil de l'individu par la d\u00e9couverte physique et virtuelle et l'exp\u00e9rience. De nombreuses m\u00e9thodes p\u00e9dagogiques existent, je vais bient\u00f4t rencontrer <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/andresdavila\">Andres Davila</a> et son \u00e9quipe \u00e0 ce sujet.\n\nJe discute \u00e9galement d'un outil p\u00e9dagogique avec des enseignants, si j'avais les moyens de le d\u00e9velopper, je pourrais d\u00e8s \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent l'exp\u00e9rimenter sans que cela sorte du cadre scolaire et sans aucun risque juridico-hierarchico-lourd.

The most rewarding part was the many conversations bringing together people involved in founding Las Indias, Shareable, Zero Waste, Ouishare, <a href=\"/user/5957\">@Fil\u00e9_Aesir</a>, Darwin Ecosystem and Edgeryders. Not only was it a much needed time for us to exchanging experiences and learning from one another\u2019s successes, and failures. It also gave us time explore where we could align work and activities to contribute to achieving goals of helping one another and the communities we care about to build interesting, meaningful and resilient lives.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Why this topic, why now?</h3>\n\nThe hype machine is struggling to come to terms with the growing backlash against the large centralised actors like Airbnb and Uber. <a href=\"http://www.virgin.com/entrepreneur/forget-the-sharing-economy-its-time-for-the-crowd-economy\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Forget the sharing economy</a>, we are recommended, for different but same same. Unless they mature to the point of sharing resources and power with the very community members who generate value for the owners and investors, platforms like Airbnb or Uber can be seen as <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-nib/the-case-against-sharing-9ea5ba3d216d\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">part of the problem</a>.\n\nI learned that certain Latin American and Spanish cities are following a separate trajectory from the North American ones. Realising they could never compete with other cities if they follow the growth-driven model, they are exploring alternatives which may serve as more realistic models for cities around the world. In the competition for talent and creative energy focusing on increasing citizen happiness and quality of life is more promising than contrived efforts to grow Silicon Valleys in every city, region and town across the planet. The Valley is a particular place with a particular culture which was a hundred years in the making, as Neal puts it. Why are we not asking what is a hundred years in the making in our own cities and start there?\n\nAlso, there are signs that the combination of lousy infrastructure, unchecked speculation in the housing market, and lack of social cohesion between the tech community brogrammers and other inhabitants is putting the model under severe stress as others try to emulate it.\n\nThe city of Bogota is a good case study of the positive consequences of following a development model in which the city is framed as first and foremost a place for citizens to build good lives together, rather than a marketplace. And it seems to be generating promising results: over the past ten years Bogota has gone from one of the most dangerous cities in the world to one which offers its citizens a high quality of life. This is no coincidence. The city has a recent history of adopting policies lead by creative mayors that draw their ideas from histories, thinkers and ideological foundations different from those underpinning US-centric models.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Sharing, resilience and Stewardship: When communities step to the forefront</h3>\n\nThis excerpt (thanks Millie!) sums up the trend emerging from stories shared with me while traveling in the US, Germany and Spain:\n\n<em>\u201cNew opportunities for sharing create new opportunities to enhance trust and rebuild social capital. But commercial sharing is also creating new spaces in which commercial interests can force workers into casual contracts, privatize public services and drive up land values and rents through gentrification. In these ways the emerging sharing economy can deepen both social and spatial inequalities and deliver injustice. City leaders need to support and emphasize communal models of sharing that build solidarity and spread trust. Sharing systems designed around equity and justice will naturally shift cultural values and norms towards trust and collaboration. This can deliver a further dividend, as increased trust increases social investment in public goods and the public realm\". Source:<a href=\"http://time.com/3446050/smart-cities-should-mean-sharing-cities/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> Smart Cities, should mean Sharing Cities</a></em>\n\nWhen we started building LOTE4 it was based on an observation that networked communities are playing an important role in helping us all navigate social-ecological, economic and political crises:\n\n<em>\"Stewardship manifests as the gardening of an ecology. In so much that it is not curation or archiving. Stewardship can only relate to that which is active - it acknowledges and works towards the preservation and growth of use value, exclusively. \"</em>\n\n<em>\"work against the sense of just working for today\"</em>\n\n<em>\"act as carrier of the learnings of what we develop around Stewardship to communities who...could benefit\"</em>\n\n<em>\"creating conditions for real support and mutual aid\" [including mental health]\"</em>\n\n<em>\u201cresponsibility of stewards to ensure something doesn\u2019t get fucked up by externalities\"</em>\n\nIn the Edgeryders/LOTE4 take the protagonists are communities. It is they who deal with public goods and services. However there is a catch: in the experience of many of us, it is easy to lean too heavily on communities and their more generous members (open source projects, anyone?), involuntarily causing them to burn out. Edgeryders is no exception. So, our version of stewardship is about communities taking care of public goods, services and community members themselves. This twist makes the mix sustainable. And what underpins that is taking a good hard look at the economic and lifestyle choices we make. The reality is people are working under very precarious economic conditions with costs skyrocketing in some of the major cities and that is detrimental to our abiltiy to participate actively in community life: social as well as economic. After Gijon it is clear that community-run businesses that service the basic needs of inhabitants are a key ingredient in resilient cities and communities.<a href=\"http://www.seikatsuclub.coop/about/english.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> One example to learn from is that of Seikatsu</a> Club Consumer\u2019s Cooperative in Tokyo, Japan:\n\n<em>\u201cA network of buying clubs with over 300,000 members, the Seikatsu Club in Japanoriginated in 1965 as a way for families to get a bulk rate on milk. Over the last 50 years, it has expanded to include thousands of organic, non-GMO foods and environmentally-safe household products. In 1995, Seikatsu formed its first worker coop. It now has 600 of them, employing over 17,000 people in food distribution, food preparation, catering, recycling, childcare, education and more\". Source: <a href=\"http://www.shareable.net/blog/16-worker-coops-redefining-the-cooperative-movement\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">16 Worker Coops Redefining the Cooperative Movement</a>.</em>\n\nThe way Seikatsu Club works is that neighborhood leaders get orders from their neighbours and then they bulk buy whatever they need. Seikatsu Club has over 1 Billion USD in turnover according to Neil Gorenflo, <a href=\"http://www.shareable.net/blog/16-worker-coops-redefining-the-cooperative-movement\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">founder of Shareable, and are now buying their suppliers</a> All this is serving their mission to get people to buy less (and higher quality) good and services as the collective economic clout is making the residents a political player in the city.\n\nHowever, cooperative models are not without their limitations.\n\nFor one thing they can get very insular and hard to enter as new arrival, as they can have high boundaries between \"insiders\" and \"outsiders\". Also, while they have been around for a long time they are less well known that the Limited Company or Charity as an organisational form. The main challenge is potentially huge governance overhead which is not great when you are starting up with few resources time- or moneywise.\n\nEdgeryders differs in that we are a predominantly online community, emergent by design (people work on and discover things across themes and contexts) and mutual support network for people doing work in different parts of the world. Across borders, generations and ideological divides. There is a strong desire to ensure the economic benefits of what we build together are shared by the community members but with light governance overhead, self selected participation and work in loose networks. So far we have focused on information exchange, inter-project collaboration, and transnational cooperation: collective intelligence at work. With the unMonastery prototype we took tentative first steps towards building hybrid infrastructure to allow new kinds of social, economic and political relations to emerge in online-offline communities. We have learned a lot from it, but there are many things we would do very differently in the future if this is to be sustainable in the long run.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What could we try to achieve?</h3>\n\nA coherent and evidence-backed strategy for responding to current social and economic crises and decomposition in Europe and beyond. In this strategy second and third tier cities are the key players offering real opportunities for the young and anyone looking to build richer, more interesting and meaningful lives together with others. Ideally in the places where we already live today, or would really like to. We can coordinate across platforms and networks through common hashtags. I really like the work Shareable is doing with Sharing Cities and would like to support it, so why not \\#sharingcities?\n\nThe work has already begun, check out this beautiful repository of <a href=\"/t/lote4-stewardship-case-studies/418\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Stewardship Case Studies</a> built by Lauren, Maria, Jeff, Hazem, Donahu, Ben, Anna and hopefully you.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What next?</h3>\n\nIntroducing the model for discussion att <a href=\"/en/welcome-to-lote4\">#lote4</a> next week where those interested will explore a first sketch and set of activities to get the ball rolling on this.

It's great to hear that you're familiar with Irish culture, I am doing a business degree through the medium of Irish and my history, language, arts, tradition and sense of identity are all very important to me.\n\nLet me explain the RAG model to you as I think it will add to the discussion.\n\nRAG started in Dublin City University, a friend and I started it and we launched in September 2011. Our vision is to see an engaged, able and empowered student body that are active in shaping the future of Ireland.\u00a0\n\nOur model follows our motto, 'engage, equip, empower.' Firstly RAG is a very strong brand in Ireland, we have a membership of 500 students in DCU and we are regarded as a very popular society. It was important to us to engage the entire student body, if we had of called ourselves the 'Lets develop a social conscience society' we would not have gotten as much attention and involvement. This is the 'engage' step of our process, we engage the student body with large-scale fundraisers and awareness campaigns. And more importantly, we aim to get students involved in tackling social issues who would not have gotten involved if it were not for RAG. It's about waking students up to the problems in our society!\n\nFor example, last year we held a white collar boxing event where we trained 30 students how to box and then they fought in a ring. The boxers were tought how to fundraise and the ticketed event itself raised over \u20ac6000. We regard this as engagement, upwards of 400 students attended the event and they all got an insight in to how RAG works, we promoted volunteering opportunities to them and we signed some of them up to the society.\n\nThe next stage of 'equipment' is about giving the students the skills that they need to make a difference in society. We currently have over 50 active monthly volunteers volunteering with local community projects that we have partnered with. An example being The Aisling project, which is safe environment for young, at risk children to do their homework and have a hot meal. Other students are involved with event/campaign organising, PR, marketing and \u00a0a lot more. The aim is to teach these students about how to run a social project/initiative/enterprise (a very loose term that is yet to be defined).\u00a0\n\nIn the final stage of empowerment we are aiming to use the money we have fundraised (10k so far with an aim of 25k by May 2012) to invest in sustainable social enterprises that students come up with and run themselves.\n\nWe are still learning ourselves but we are making steady and good progress. Two days ago our first sister society launched in University of Limerick. Soon we will be launching the national organisation and we aim to have a RAG society in every Irish university within 3 years.\u00a0\n\nSO! Are we an initiative or WHAT :) Firstly, I have some big goals that I want to achieve later on in life and RAG is part of that, however, RAG MUST be sustainable and it must be able to flourish without me or anyone constant. RAG is a social enterprise, it is enterprising because it is taking a new approach to a problem that is not being tackled.\n\nHope that helps, I'm enjoying this so feel free to chalenge and/or ask more :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-17 13:04:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:48.765202", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 631, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18145, "user_id": 2913, "topic_id": 5227, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Ok</b>\n\nI did it for the LOTE event.\n\nUnfortunatly I have to fly back to Milan on Friday evening...\n\nLucia will stay for MoN till Sat morning.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-18 09:58:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:41.349732", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 41, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17900], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10960, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5036, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Convert session proposals into events?</b>\n\nNot sure how this works with the automated feeds though, only for posts or everything in that group?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-07 17:41:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:03.209749", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 29, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7344], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20079, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 1870, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>grassroot </b>\n\nyes, \"<span>grassroot level</span>\" would be quite interesting :)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-28 19:14:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:51.783663", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 32, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27292, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4081, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Nope</b>\n\nMarco has been in touch with KITE, and they expressed interest.

But Lucas Gonzalez took that to a whole new level. With an incredible act of kindness, he took it upon himself to transcribe the words of the Edgeryders 3 minutes presentation video to create subtitles for the hearing impaired. He then went a step a further and translated the subtitles into Spanish! Thank you Lucas, we are really, really honored by your committment. It means a lot to this bunch of lonely Eurocrats that somebody cares about what we are trying to do so much to actually want to help. Please, everybody, let's head off to <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/lucasg\">Lucas's Edgeryders page</a> to say hello and thank you. This is a lot of cred for the House of the Fox, his House of choice. Lucas used Universal Subtitles, an online service that makes it supereasy to translate subtitles in any language (translations are automagically synced with the video). So, if you want to help too you can translate the subtitles in your own language. To do so, <a href=\"http://www.universalsubtitles.org/es/videos/14PHRm1OCieV/info/Edgeryders%20in%203%20minutes/\">go here</a> and you'll be translating in a few seconds. I am going to start an Italian translation. Anybody wants to help me? Any other language?\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-09 17:31:50", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 12:44:42.209159", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 264, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23057, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5187, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Not at all convinced about the walk</b>\n\nI would keep it in the venue as much as possible.

Is it driven by one or very few committed people? Is is widely participated by very many people? A little bit of both? Are participants structurally similar or are they very different socially and economically? All these different situation correspond to network configurations.

It follows two important things that have happened since the community met last year:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t\tEdgeryders is now a social enterprise! We may be the first case ever of a spin-off from a public sector online project (originally under the Council of Europe). We have already <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-should-we-morph-into-a-social-enterprise/1033\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a> why we are doing this, and how this can benefit the whole community. We still think it is worth doing, and we are moving forward.</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\tThe first project from the Edgeryders community is also moving forward. <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315\" target=\"_blank\">UnMonastery Matera</a> is officially set to open later in the year or early in 2014. The unMonastery moved from a concept to reality in less than one year. Ben Vickers did it, so chances are you can do it too \u2013 with a little luck and a lot of help from the rest of the community.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nLIVING ON THE EDGE IS WHERE WE BUILD SKILLS AND TOOLS TO DO SO\n\nIt just makes sense for us all to get together and be inspired by the momentum which has gathered in Matera and online, and get better at using the community's resources for our complementary projects that build off the platform. We\u2019ll do it in the unMonastery building itself \u2013 it is breathtaking! We'll even have an epic Halloween party! Trust us, you want to save the date.\n\nWhat happens is\u00a02 days of intense peer to\u00a0peer workshops and masterclasses\u00a0to build the Edgeryders Guide to Making Projects Happen, with documentation on what is working for some of us, what knowledge and skillsets need to be deployed in what situation, what organisational resources are there for the community.\u00a0This will be\u00a0followed by\u00a0a peer-to-peer, open format unconference.\u00a0As before, all sessions are free and open to everyone.\n\n<div>\n\nYES, I\u2019M COMING TO LOTE - THE UNMONASTERY EDITION 29 OCTOBER - 3 NOVEMBER!\n\nSo, are you?\u00a0We made\u00a0it easy to register.

The first people to be funded will be those who first commit to coming! Even if we don\u2019t succeed, it will be cheaper than staying at home: it\u2019s just a RyanAir flight to Bari and inexpensive accommodation:\u00a0think friendly\u00a0locals, couchsurfers or friends.</span>\n\nParticipation is free of charge, but LOTE is a no spectators event: we all put in something, be it time, skills, even social capital because we all help promote it.\u00a0What would you like to do, discuss or learn about in this LOTE?

So, I only simplify user experience when I feel the need to do so.\u00a0\n\nIn my professional life, this has been an unexhaustible source of discussion with some colleagues and peers, especially those that come from the commercial sector. Apparently, the conventional wisdom in advertising and commercial communication is that the user is stupid, greedy and selfish. He has an attention span of perhaps ten seconds, and reacts best to very basic animal impulses. We are both Italian, so former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi \u00a0(a master of commercial communication) comes to mind when he famously said: \"The customer, the general public is like a 11-year-old-kid. Not even a particulary smart one.\"\u00a0\n\nMr. Berlusconi knows his business well, and it is completely possible that he is right. On the other hand, some online communities that are very complex to use are also hugely successful: look at Wikipedia, with its maze of guidelines, templates and discussion pages... and its over 30 million users.\n\nMe, I choose to abide by the old sayings of online community managers: \"assume good faith, and deal with abuses on a case-by-case basis\" and \"if you design a system for trolls, your users will be trolls\". If you design a system based on polarized black/white options because this is the maximum degree of intellectual sophistication that users can get, you risk attracting precisely that kind of unsophisticated users. This may be good or bad, depending on your goals, but it is important to be aware of it. Would you use a platform that assumes you are not smart enough to understand nuances and multiple choices?\n\nI hope you don't find this too provocative. I don't mean to imply you don't know what you are doing, but simply to compare notes: Like you, I am passionate about this area of collaboration.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-18 15:55:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:06.463156", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 391, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23584, "user_id": 1861, "topic_id": 3289, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>Why next year? :)</b>\n\nAnd why not? and why next year?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-16 08:32:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:10.897130", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1890], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32310, "user_id": 72, "topic_id": 1625, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Heaven in Hell's despite</b>\n\nMy <a href=\"http://maxwelldemon.com/2012/06/20/build-a-heaven-in-hells-despite/\">first reactions</a> to living on the edge and edgecamp.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-20 13:04:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:57.588777", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 34, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30520, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5571, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>No problem for me</b>\n\nI will arrive on 19th and stay on even after the meeting.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-03 14:43:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:48.013249", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30438], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31392, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4192, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>Not sure which organisation, replies regarding both.</b>\n\nNot sure which org you are asking about\n\n1) Re: Edgeryders organisation ( link accessible from main menu all over the site) I tried to summarise the backstory in <a href=\"/t/lets-adore-and-endure-each-other/3865\">this post</a>.

Whether or not this is the case, it is a move that makes complete sense to me on all levels and I fully support it. More organisations allow for more experimentation, diversity and resilience without adding to the already high workload involved in maintaining the shared infrastructures that enable new collectively driven projects to emerge. The issues I raised above have to do with more general practical rules about shared ownership of what comes out of the collectivity, regardless of how individual relationships and or inter-personal conflicts develop over time. I had a conversation yesterday with Lars Zimmermann from OSCE Days about how to both enable and clearly signal that it is fine for a subset of people to take a community powered project in whatever direction they choose, while not getting in the way of others wishing to do the same. His suggestion was to establish consensus on how forking can be done and part of this was figuring out a naming convention for the new projects/constellations/organisations.", "created_at": "2015-03-11 06:42:00", "updated_at": "2018-03-03 10:36:36.415275", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 317, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31253], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9467, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5165, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>What time is the disco soup happening?</b>\n\n@KiraVde I'm asking for planning purposes.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-03 14:17:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:54.546052", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1973, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1940, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h5 class=\"uiStreamMessage userContentWrapper rteindent2\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://britishmuseumblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/botd_person1.jpg?w=544\"></h5>\n\nA while\u00a0ago I met an acquaintance at an airport. We have some friends in common and since our time at university together he has gone on to build something quite remarkable so I had been following his journey.\n\nWe had not met in a long time. Well, not sat down and had a conversation at least. I asked him how things were. And we had one of those conversations of rare honesty. His father was very unwell, dying. I asked him if he was getting any support and he told me how strange it was that no one really wanted to get into the subject. How utterly alone he felt. I told him that in my parents' culture, mourning was a communal experience. That when a family member died, for the next fourty days friends and neighbours would share the reponsibility of bringing food to the homes of those who had lost a loved one. And ensure they were never alone. I remembered my own grandmother's funeral, how loud and busy an affair it was with women wailing.\n\nI mentioned having visited the British Museum for\u00a0an <a href=\"http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2010/09/22/what-is-a-book-of-the-dead/\">exhibition on\u00a0the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead</a>. How strange I found the absence of death in our contemporary culture, almost as though it were banished to a parallel world. We spoke of how wish for death and wish for life may well be\u00a0intertwined. Where does it go when banished from the public sphere? How does the absence of rituals to deal with it affect our behaviours and our <a href=\"/t/the-burning-edge/1144/5\">spiritual resilience</a>\u00a0in the face of adversity? Especially for those who are not religious?\n\n<a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9018151/the-ideal-death-show/\">This article</a> brought back that conversation. This time I would like to give it some serious reflection. If ever there was an opportune time, the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315\">building of the unMonastery</a> might be it...\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-12 18:53:32", "updated_at": "2017-09-15 10:28:49.632270", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 387, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 31.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1438, 1516, 3352], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3421, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3388, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Together with @Matthias and <a href=\"/u/natalia_skoczylas\">@Natalia Skoczylas</a>\u00a0we have thought about a process for registering to Lote4. Note: tickets are not for free, yet they can't be bought, only earned by completing tasks and collaborating with others in the next months. Our major focus was on: what would it take for a participant to go from task assignment and completion to conference ticket and how can we support integration with Makerfox?\n\n<strong>How does the barter deal work on Makerfox?</strong>\n\nThe user starts by signaling that they want to<a href=\"http://www.makerfox.com/market/products?q=ticket\"> buy a ticket</a> that is listed. Then they should be sent to a page where all the tasks are listed (named Services on makerfox), and he can offer a number of them (<a href=\"http://www.makerfox.com/market/services?category_id=5946\">example</a> where all listings will be). For a deal to be made, the value of the ticket purchased needs to equal the total value of the services offered.\n\nOnce a deal is made you get a notification on makerfox in the top right of the platform and by email, saying that Lote4 will send instructions on how to do the service/task. There will be a message thread for each sale with the current states of deals.

It could be an overview &amp; monitoring page on Edgeryders with everyone who ordered a ticket and what the state of the deal is.\n\n<strong>Lote4 ticket cost</strong>\n\nThe value is currently set at 1000$, which we all think is way too much because of several reasons, one of which is that is only gives you access to the event, it doesn\u2019t pay for your trip or covers additional costs you may have to participate. But the most important one has to do with realistic value and achievement of tasks. A better pricing would be 200$ because this could easily correspond with a task\u2019s worth (eg a post on Edgeryders, a newsletter, a poster design etc). Ideally most tasks will be worth the exact ticket value to keep the algorythm simple and make sure that anyone who offers to do a task gets a deal from makerfox.

Seeing how tourists spend their time in Bali made me feel really weird - everyone white and shopping because in top tourist areas there is not much more.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, charging 500 dollars a week in a place where you can get an excellent room for 100, run by a local family, makes very little sense to me - but it will appeal to people who want to see the good western design, for example. Also seeing what's the difference of wages between westerners living in Bali and the locals, and the real estate available to them, is stunning. Indonesians rent 15 square meters big studios for 80 dollars a month (which is 1/3 of their wage usually), around 20-30 min out of the center of Kuta or Denpasar. Luckily, gas is cheap - but that causes a disaster on the roads, I bet you experience it every day. Meanwhile, local developers invest heavily in villas everywhere they can - because this is what the tourists would rent. And this costs a couple of times more than the locals earn monthly, leaving them very few choices. Even families with kids sometimes end up in these tiny studios because there's nowhere else they could afford to go without losing their jobs. And 300 euros is a good pay there.\u00a0\n\nDefinitely,\u00a0nothing like roam\u00a0in my opinion ;) I would maybe vote for having one or two boutique rooms which we could sell to wealthy nomads who want to support the community by paying a bit extra, for a good quality sleep and a nice space. But that's just a small addition to very affordable, ideally very competitive prices for rent. Or being able to give it to some for free.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-16 16:14:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:53.011644", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 358, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3677, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3644, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The KnowLab conference resulted in a powerful insight: not everybody can use the future \u2013 in fact most people cannot. The ability to do foresight, and learn from foresight done by others has to be forged. KnowLab listed five waypoints on the way to futures literacy \u2013 each of them an ability itself. For each waypoint, we interview a wise or remarkable person and ask her how she acquired that particular ability.\n\nThe first ability is the ability to <strong>learn to look beyond one's construction of reality</strong>. We could learn how to develop it to network scientist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_J._Watts\">Duncan Watts</a>. Watts is the author of a book called <em>E</em><em>verything is obvious (once you know the answer),</em>\u00a0in which he passionately and convincingly argues that common sense is lousy at navigating situations that feature a great many agents interacting with each other. In those situations \u2013 which, not coincidentally, include <em>almost all</em>\u00a0real-life business and public policy decisions \u2013\u00a0common sense is actually a liability, and we need to learn to mistrust it and, instead, \"trust the data\".\n\nThe second ability is the ability to <strong>understand that the outlook on the future is contestable ground,\u00a0and why that matters for the present</strong>. We ask how to do this to <a href=\"http://www.rielmiller.com/\">Riel Miller</a>, head of foresight at UNESCO. Miller has long cultivated a \"militant\" approach to foresight, and is convinced that the way we see the future will reverberate on present decisions, therefore <i>changing\u00a0</i>the future itself.\u00a0\n\nThe third ability is the ability to <strong>think like a complexity scientist</strong>, leaving behind narrativised accounts of reality and teaching oneself to recognise emergence\u00a0and self-organisation. We ask how he did that to <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/champions/laureates/2012/Leeuw.asp\">Sander van der Leeuw</a>, archeologist of innovation, Santa Fe Institute scholar, and Dean of the School of sustainability at Arizona State University, who has relentlessy pursued a <em>very</em> long-term view on social and economic system dynamics \u2013 \u00a0and this has recently led him to conclude that \"innovation is a Ponzi scheme.\u00a0\n\nThe fourth ability is the ability to <strong>learn from others already using the future</strong>. Here we draw on the experience of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiNc2ArMGck\">Giulio Quaggiotto</a>, currently heading the UN Pulse Lab. He has systematically worked to build an ecosystem of colleagues and practitioners of foresight (and other things) to learn from, with particular attention to outliers, radical experimenters and, recently... big data.\n\nThe fifth ability is the ability to <strong>manage the tension between the need for sense-making and the need to act</strong>. We suggest to ask <a href=\"http://re.silience.com/\">Vinay Gupta</a> how he developed his. He is a scholar and a practitioner of foresight, but he is also a doer, spearheading his own game-changing effort in the resilience crowd, particularly with the <a href=\"http://hexayurt.com/\">Hexayurt project</a>.\u00a0\n\nDo you have other people you would like to learn these abilities from? Why? Let us know who they are and what your reasons are for wanting to learn from then, and we will see what we can do to accommodate you.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-19 14:58:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:20.011342", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 587, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26063, "user_id": 3597, "topic_id": 791, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>AllergoKi - IoT e le allergie alimentari - APP e gadgets</b>\n\nProgettazione dell'App e di un gadget del kit\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-03 16:24:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:24.054726", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 22, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13504, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 517, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>\"Citizens Guides\" exist </b>\n\nOf course with some different focus groups and cases,\u00a0but \"The Citizen\" does not exist. So what I'd think is crucial is the presentation format and delivery method.\n\nFor example after a catastrophy (or on the march) very few people will have the time to read about it in Red Cross or USAid pdfs even though they would probably remember critical things much better than in a classroom. Some can understand scientific papers, and others cannot read. Generally, if you want to be prepared you need to invest some time into practicing or reading e.g. \"Where there is no Doctor\", or stocking some tools or supplies before shit hits the fan. Not many people are ready to do that. It is much less glamorous than posing with big guns and other stuff. Often people (correctly) feel it is unlikely that they would get a return on investment for their effort. Also, crises affect different regions (e.g. climate) in different ways, in those regions e.g. urban areas will be affected differently from rural, in those places <a href=\"http://thesurvivalmom.com/prepping-type-1-diabetes/\">different people</a> (age, occupation, gender, minority) will again be affected differently in short to long term.\n\nMost documents I know are written in a linear fashion, either for \"the general populace\" or authorities, or a few select critcal professions. Research articles in the field are often a bit better (if you can get them and understand them) as they show more of the detail under the hood. There is quite a bit out there in English, <a href=\"https://www.bbk.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/BBK/DE/Publikationen/Broschueren_Flyer/Buergerinformationen_A4/Ratgeber_Brosch.pdf\">German</a>, and I am sure French language. I would expect that other languages can be a very mixed bag.\n\nInterestingly almost none of the materials I know are intended for reproduction and dissemination (perhaps modification) in the field, which I think is a critical shortcoming. Economically you often cannot but be largely unprepared for low frequency large impact events. If you could could start quickly copy-pasting stuff from a relatively few seeds once the event has come to pass, you would very quickly be able to deliver information and organize action far better.\n\nI think the most realistic forms of reproduction in the field are (including grid down, excluding perhaps nuclear EMP scenarios):\n\n- Copies via smart phone, either onto micro-sd card or using e.g. bluetooth file transfer.\n\n- Recording of spoken/played material via phone, perhaps eventually put into writing.\n\n- Pencil/coal stick/copy machine copies of simple illustrations/heuristics/nmemonics/ not more than a few lines in most cases.\n\nMy suggestion would be a less linear and mostly digital collection of material (even if the grid will be down it will be relatively easy to charge a smartphone/tablet/etc from solar or car batteries). Ideally most of it can be accessed through different lenses - weighing urgent vs important, for the specific \"type\" of audience, in a (or several) appropriate formats. On the latter point I would strongly recommend inlcuding something that is audio based with separate illustrations (and check lists, e.g. in playing card deck, or digitally as \"album art\" format) and incremental navigation (e.g. if you need to know more on this topic press forward 9 times and you hear the announcement \"xyz\"). An audio lecture then could be made up of a summary of 1. the most important things to know in a hurry, 2. the main content, 3. mnemonic take aways to repeat to yourself.\n\nAudio has the advantages that you do not need to drop everything you're doing, you can do it while walking, and you can do it in the dark.\n\nIf you use 64kbps (clear spoken language) mono mp3 audio you need approximately 1 MB for every 2 minutes. If we assume 24h of spoken material that would be 720 MB. This fits into almost every memory card (or CD), mp3 player and can be copied using bluetooth version 3 in 5 minutes, and version 2 in 30 minutes. The most important things everyone needs to know should probably be available in different languages but be only 3-15 minutes in duration. Additional material can be provided in ebook format (which can be referenced in the audio) with very little space required.\n\nMy schematic in the other comment is an example for non-digital content that can also be reproduced in the field, when you actually have demand. It could also be airdropped as leaflets of course.\n\nI wanted to make a heuristic approach to re-establish some skeletal form of organization which can catalyze coopreration (especially in the 48h hours of pro-social behavior mostly observed after an acute catastrophe). I thought this is necessary because very often there exists no effective interface to the local society that the \"professional care &amp; aid circus\" can dock into, and many of the respective group's fuck-ups would be easier to avoid if there was such an interface. The idea is to establish channels on the ground within the local community which accumulate, curate (discuss), and disseminate critical information. Those information dense hubs can relatively easily be found and interfaced with the professionals. If the crises do not have a clear onset like an earthquale or flood, but is more creeping other approaches may be more effective though.\n\nThe implied understanding that may motivate people is the following: Doing difficult situations alone is usually not a good idea*. Put 20% into helping each other, and if the majority survives you'll probably be among them.\n\n<strong>The simplified instructions: 1 of 5 connects and helps to coordinate. 1 in 5 helps to coordinate coordinators. Information must flow in both directions fast, and critical aspects need to be documented.</strong>\n\nMake a group in which you will quickly be able to trust, care, and communicate (so about 5). Then make groups of groups and dedicate 10-20% of your resources to communication &amp; cooperation, about half \"upwards\" and half \"downwards\".\n\n*Something that rarely gets enough attention when you superficially glance at the prepper scene. Alone you are probably prey to your own stupidity, germs, or pack hunters. Your gun does not help when you are sleeping.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-06 18:29:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:16.381989", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1080, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13477], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22189, "user_id": 2725, "topic_id": 4613, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Indeed</b>\n\nHey there Nadia, thanks for your comment, it might be a professional shortcoming as you clearly point out.

So hackers get a great environment with good food, accomodation and community, and can use it to support each others' projects. Hosts get rewarded by the hackers contributing to their business startup project as well.\n\nThis creates synergy out of three issues: (1) Current hackathons are productive as multi-day code sprint events for open source software, but also very exhausting because of unsuitable and neglected living environments for the traveling hackers. (2) Free help from ICT experts is in high demand in the startup world, so that those without an IT pro on the team often find themselves severely limited in what they can do and develop, and hackers often are frustrated by the high number of requests from cash-starved \u201clean startups\u201d seeking free help. (3) At the same time, these hackers have their own, often unexpressed issues for which they would welcome others' support: a social working environment to replace isolated coding, a healthy living conditions in spite of working a lot, and non-technical support for their own startups and initiatives, ranging from graphics work to marketing and organizational assistance.\n\n<h3 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;\">Q5: Please tell us why you believe your idea is innovative in a given context.

Most startups need support to take off, but the support that friends and family can give without compensation is quite limited. With always scarce money being no option for compensating that support, fee-based business incubators are also no option.\n\nSo a non-monetary compensation scheme is needed. Time banking and alternative currencies are an alternative, but come with their own issues: the insular nature of these alternative economy projects together with the international nature of the startup world means that one will hardly find a group of people who are both qualified to help, and agree on the same alternative currency for compensation.\n\nSo instead, the innovation is here a clever mode for a compensation with direct bartering. In contrast to a simple economic transaction it does not need formal accounting of efforts, and also caters to social and physical needs of the participants. The temporary, event-like nature of this idea also fits well into how these startups have to organize everything with little resources.\n\n<h3 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;\">Q6: How will your idea have an impact? (max 200 words)</h3>\n\nIn effect, harmonious hackathons provide the services of a full-fledged business incubator to all participants (both hosts and hackers): there is \u201coffice space\u201d, ready-made infrastructure like Internet access, time-saving and comfort-enhancing services like coffee, meals etc., and of course there are a lot of people with diverse skills who are willing to help out on each others projects in a reciprocal manner.\n\nJust that this business incubator is accessible for everyone who has something to contribute as a host or hacker, and not just to those who can pay the fees (or win the entry) for a commercial business incubator.\n\nSo the effect of this new form of social organization (and of promoting and documenting it) is that many more business ideas get a chance to reach the market, and their creators get a chance to create their own jobs this way.\n\n<h3 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;\">Q7: At what scale will your idea operate initially and how do you think it can be implemented in another region or EU Member State in the future? (max 200 words)</h3>\n\nThe implementation will start with five to ten prototypical harmonious hackathon events. For these, we already have a selection of both potential hosts and hackers in mind; it is an informal group of creative young people from all over Europe, with about 30% IT experts (they came up with this whole idea and think it is socially and economically viable).\n\nThe events will be hosted in different European countries (among which should be Greece, Spain, Italy and / or Portugal because of their high youth unemployment). Exact locations depend on what space hosts have accessible for these events.\n\nEvery prototype event will close with a feedback session, which provides input for an even better follow-up event. All prototype events will include extensive publicity work to attract potential hosts and hackers who want to organize their own harmonious hackathons; they can do so right away, in parallel to the prototype events, and are supported with the website providing a calendar and RSVP system. After the last prototype event, experiences will be collected in a manual and published on the website.\n\n<h3 class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;\">Q8: How do you think your idea could be sustained over the next three years? (max 200 words)</h3>\n\nA single harmonious hackathon is lean and self-sustaining because it is to support lean startups. So, location and food will be provided by the hackathon hosts, and can be as cheap as sharing a private home and home-cooking good, simple meals.\n\nIn social terms, sustainability will be supported through a web platform with information about upcoming hackathons, allowing to register for participation or offering an own hackathon.\n\nNo investment is needed for the development of this website: it will be created as an \u201cexercise\u201d during the prototypical hackathons. The effort of keeping this website running is one part-time job, or can be taken over by two volunteers.\n\nHowever, scaling this up needs more than volunteer effort. Within five years, we hope there will be enough harmonious hackathons to cover the ICT needs of all startup companies enabled by this model (300-400 events per month, based on 5.5 million unemployed youth &lt;25 years in EU27, with 5% latent entrepreneurs, 30 people per hackathon, 2.5 hackathon participations per startup, distributed over 5 years). For this to happen, a major investment into publicity is needed. We currently apply for a total of about 100,000 EUR in grants for this purpose.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-10 23:47:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:12.291847", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1266, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 31.0, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4, 369, 2424, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30573, "user_id": 3024, "topic_id": 5044, "post_number": 25, "raw": ":)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-27 23:16:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:48.285606", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30572], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20194, "user_id": 212, "topic_id": 3930, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>would like to contribute!</b>\n\nNot sure what would be the most helpful.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-21 17:12:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:52.459368", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31359, "user_id": 2580, "topic_id": 4517, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Yes!</b>\n\nWelcome onboard, Ioana!

We'll call him Steve.\n\n\n![|608x383](upload://hwZGbzi9fLV9kL3dVplNyQ2eYHq.gif)<br>\n\n\u201cYou can't learn to be a butcher, you are born a butcher.\u201d Kids apprentice after school because these types of jobs require motions and dexterity that you have to grow into. It's difficult to learn this trade if you're already grown. An amateur butcher is easy to spot.\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/81b4b248e94e63e22a1a377066281634a2d56bb0.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"495\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"; text-align: JUSTIFY;\">Period of Isolation</h3>\n\nWorking as butchers was a step up from the life his parents once lived in the countryside and opening a butcher shop in the city was an opportunity that the whole family jumped into; aunt, uncle, cousins and all. When Steve was old enough to see over the counter top, that's when he started to work. It was planned out before his birth. In the beginning it was fun, but soon the family business took up so much of his time that he barely had a chance to socialize with the other kids.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/28a3f1f8a9d417965b167427c425ed9455920a1f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"; text-align: JUSTIFY;\">Cultivate Hobbies/Interests</h3>\n\nWorking in a butcher shop is an intense job, the schedule is similar to that of a baker but with additional hours in the evenings and your weekends are tied up too. Quickly the life he had been born into became a sort of trap. He had to find a balance between work and school and his hobby, which was fixing computers. The most frustrating part was that his hobby didn't earn him much money since clients preferred paying large sums of money to unskilled technicians who usually didn't solve the problem whereas Steve, who was still \u201cjust a kid\u201d, was disposed to work for much less.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/eb66f5b1bb654885d2eb81fce51bfb679f171fb2.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"400\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" lang=\"en-US\">Find a Community</h3>\n\nBut it was during this period before going to college that Steve began to experience some sort of community beyond his family/work paradigm. This was the age of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system\">BBS</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat\">IRC</a>, where you could connect with people around the world via a shared common interest: technology.\n\nI remember these early days of internet myself, when I had my first video chat with other kids in Korea. That was over 20 years ago. These uncharted web explorations opened up a new world for me; you never knew where you'd end up. Nowadays, your web journeys are pretty much <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/522111/how-to-burst-the-filter-bubble-that-protects-us-from-opposing-views/\">preprogrammed</a>.\n\n \n\n \n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/51181384\n\n \n\nBut Steve was a far more curious boy than I and he joined some early online communities whereas I was just an observer. One of these early trends was going to \u201cleech events\u201d, an example of how virtual online communities would give birth to IRL meetings based on mutual necessities: software.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dc75e2efce98c1991cf3b3a58e62289a0185d9d5.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nPeople would carry their computers to these venues and spend hours copying files using floppy disks. In these situations, Steve was usually the youngest person present, by about 15 years. Curiosity brought him well outside of his comfort zone, but learning from older and more experienced hackers made it worth his while. Try to imagine that this was before the laptop and people even carried their monitors to these events.\n\n \n\n \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/EKEeHREK2nQ\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"; text-align: JUSTIFY;\">Study</h3>\n\nAfter spending his adolescence working by day and hacking by night, he went to college and came to an agreement with his parents. In order to study, he had to stay in Athens to be near the shop and so his choices were limited. He studied Business and IT, but it didn't really make a difference, because afterwards he would have to go back to the shop. Then came his military service.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7755f80409a01653b03a0e102a318be666ea4758.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"471\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"; text-align: JUSTIFY;\">Seclusion / Isolation</h3>\n\nAlthough Steve isn't (and never was) a supporter of the military, in his country it was forced. An obligatory year of military service doesn't sound like a vacation, but he made the best of it. The entire ordeal was a farce. For the first time he got a good night's sleep. And by being friendly with superiors he got more time off. This break with routine provided him with the mental space to think. Think about his life, where things were going and what he wanted.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"; text-align: JUSTIFY;\">Live Abroad</h3>\n\nWhen he got out of the military he decided to apply for a masters and found himself living in Stockholm. It was the first time he was in such an international environment, and although he had many friends in his home town, his circuit was fairly closed. Living abroad showed Steve \"How nice life could be\", and focused on his studies as a way out.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"; text-align: JUSTIFY;\">Autonomy</h3>\n\nAfter completing his studies, Steve's parents expected him to come home and work in the shop, but Steve had another opportunity: to go to Berlin to work in IT. No one in his family understood how he was earning a living. He had been living in an environment where he was controlled by money, duty and, to a certain extent, guilt. He gained his autonomy yet his Grandmother thinks he works in a factory in Germany. He was finally in a place to make decisions.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"; text-align: JUSTIFY;\">Spoil Yourself</h3>\n\nAfter several months backpacking around South America, Steve returned to Europe in a different mental space.\n\n \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/eKFjWR7X5dU\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"; text-align: JUSTIFY;\">Identify a Problem</h3>\n\nAfter a while, he found a problem in the hacker world. Some hackers were <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?company=vupen\">selling their exploits</a> for money. This, in his opinion, compromised the essence of the internet and increased the power of states to censor the internet. Steve had a job to do.\n\n*Contributed by a community member who wishes to remain anonymous*", "created_at": "2014-11-12 23:00:00", "updated_at": "2020-04-29 15:12:49.373937", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1236, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 16.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2161, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3935, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3902, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>This is a wiki.

As it said in a recent artticle about why Findhorn has lasted so long one guy said, \"everyone is willing to look at their stuff.\"\u00a0\n\nAnd, we agreed that the vibes matter. \u00a0Not that everyone is going to be fake nice all the time, but that human consideration very much includes the\u00a0vibrational space between people and is thus open to discussion as much as any material item.\n\nA group may\u00a0agree (tacitly or by not adhering to anything that isn't in a written agreement)\u00a0or, a group may just settle over time, into a state of\u00a0<em>not</em> pointing out when someone bothers you, or you can see that the other person is playing some sort of game or being manipulative, or being afraid to say something, or just not having the energy for it, then resentments\u00a0build up. \u00a0At a group level it can get factional. \u00a0Let it go too far and it wrecks the social bonds.\n\nOne problem with individuals and groups is not knowing what is, and is not, ok to talk about. In our community we went the route that there is nothing one cannot bring up. \u00a0High risk for sure. \u00a0Thus we got a lot of practice\u00a0doing this with many screwups and many satisfying sessions.\n\nIn deciding whether or not to say something inconvenient to someone, we thought it best to start by considering, is it helpful? \u00a0Is it kind? \u00a0How much of my impression is really coming from the other person and not from my reaction to it? \u00a0The last one is important because in an honest discussion one's motives for bringing something up very often get questioned, like it or not.\u00a0\n\nIf we couldn't come to terms, or a good feeling, we agreed that any one of us would act as a fairwitness to try to arrive at a place where everyone feels good and right and it's fine to move on.\n\nAnd if that didn't work we would expand the circle. \u00a0Since we lived close together that often happened organically. \u00a0Without having any statistics, I think we did resolve huge numbers of disagreements.\n\nI guess because we called ourselves a \"spritual community\" that embraced a very eclectic mix of sources (we were hippies after all), we would often advocate for our various points of view using tenets of other religious and spiritual practices as references.\n\nOne of them was the Buddhst idea of not getting caught up in \"praise and blame.\" \u00a0This translated for us that in giving and receiving feedback, we should stay mindful to not give or take either praise or blame. \u00a0When delivered with compassion then, it mitigates the perennial problem of somene feeling attacked and then defensive on one side and on the other\u00a0the person giving the feedback delivering it with aggression as if to say \"I blame you for this problem.\" \u00a0(Or infinate variations of these and more.) It is hard to both give and receive feedback, so there can never be too much empathy.\n\nI hope this doesn't sound too patronising. \u00a0It looks to me from the pictures of the members that your community is loaded with great people who surely have great understanding of how to get along.\n\nI guess this was my long-winded way of\u00a0saying that if nothing is formal as to how one is to behave with others and how people are to deal with certain relationship problems, much can be achieved if there is a general consensus that it's ok to say things to each other about the more subtle mental and \"vibratory\" aspects of living together and that it will get a fair hearing and be delivered with kindness, even if one is annoyed. \u00a0\n\nOne thing I do know about why one should not avoid conflict if something needs to be talked over, is that relationships with any history of resolving conflict are stronger because built into the bond is the\u00a0knowledge that\u00a0you can resolve something because you actually did it.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-11 17:56:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:26.603257", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1356, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27945, "user_id": 45, "topic_id": 1306, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>Compensating Creators for Free Culture</b>\n\nSome very provocative questions, Ela.\n\nI think\u00a0 it's important to keep in mind that the present copyright-based system hasn't been all that great for creators. So we should compare how content creators fare under free culture to how they're actually being compensated under the old system -- not to the system's shiny rhetoric (e.g. \"artists need to eat\" and other RIAA propaganda).\n\nUnder the old system, not only do the vast majority of sales revenues go to the content companies rather than the creators, but the companies restrict creation to a relatively limited stable of artists.\n\nAnd the only thing that can't be monetized under free culture is the content itself -- i.e., no\u00a0 artificial scarcity rent.\u00a0 Real scarcities can still be monetized (e.g. the classic example of tickets and concessions for musical performers, customization and support for a Linux distro, etc.).\u00a0 Besides that, time, attention and convenience are real scarcities that can be monetized.\u00a0 It's time-consuming and inconvenient to hunt down a \"free\" iteration of a cultural good that's complete, the exact version you want, and has guaranteed authenticity.\u00a0 That voucher of completeness and authenticity, presented at a convenient venue like the creator's official website, carries some value for all but the most time-rich and money-poor.\u00a0 Even charging $0.50 per song for this convenience will bring in a modest revenue.\n\nWith the near-zero overhead costs of marketing content through a website, whatever revenue does come in is all income free and clear to the creator.\u00a0 I'm too lazy to look it up, but I recall seeing a story (by Masnick? Doctorow?) about some study that found while the total revenue stream of the recording industry had fallen significantly because of file-sharing, the portion actually going to artists hadn't fallen at all.\n\nAt the same time, the time and trouble of setting up an alternative distribution venue for some free cultural good (e.g. setting up a competing print-on-demand facility and sales outlet for a book) carry some modest rents.\u00a0 For any books except those with very large sales, the potential revenues from setting up a rival printing and sales operation and selling at a lower price are probably not worth the trouble of doing so.\u00a0 So as long as a writer limits the price of POD books to only a few bucks over production costs, and doesn't get greedy, the rents from being the first to put it in print and the recognition and convenience of having an established site will probably produce at least a modest revenue stream.\n\nI've found this to be true, at any rate, with the books I've published through a POD service.\u00a0 I make a few thousand dollars in extra income each year from royalties on the books, which are all under a CC license for free reproduction for any purpose (including commercial) with attribution.\u00a0 And the last I checked, the pdf's were all available for free download from multiple torrent sites as well as my own official websites.\u00a0 If anything, the free content has served to promote my books and get me sales I wouldn't otherwise have had.\u00a0\n\nAnd whatever modest income I get is larger than I would have gotten under the legacy publishing industry.\u00a0 I seriously doubt I would even have made it past the gatekeepers at a conventional publisher -- my books wouldn't have been seen as producing enough revenue to support the editing and promotional machinery and offer a profitable return to the company.\u00a0 Even if I did get a publishing contract, the fact that their marketing people have less of a feel for my niche market than I do combined with the smaller percentage of sales they'd allow me to keep would probably have meant I got even less revenue under the conventional model.\n\nEven if content creators fare at least comparably well under free content, though, it's still not enough to support the vast majority of creators.\u00a0 I expect the real solution, in the long run, will come about through the slow, ongoing collapse of the corporate state.\u00a0 As more and more production is relocalized, rates of underemployment continue to rise, the share of value created through self-provisioning in the informal and household economies increase, and people turn to socially-based expedients to replace government- and employer-based safety nets, it's likely they will create primary social institutions.\u00a0 Such institutions will include, among other things:\u00a0 multiple-generational, extended family households or compounds; large co-housing projects and neighborhood cooperative living arrangements; urban communes; lodges and mutual aid institutions, etc.\u00a0\n\nAt the end of the transition, the average person will likely be born into some shared living arrangement with anything from a dozen to a hundred people pooling costs and risks, producing a major share of total consumption goods through intensive horticulture and garage CNC tools, and providing social safety net protections to the aged and incapacitated.\u00a0 In such arrangements, even if wage labor still survives on some scale, only a fraction of the social unit's total membership will take paid work outside in order to bring in money for expenses that can't be met internally or through barter/gifting with neighbors.\u00a0\n\nI believe such conditions will be conducive to the revival of folk culture as something created as a byproduct of organic social\u00a0 life, as well as art as an aesthetic value embodied in the creation of ordinary household goods and decorations.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-22 15:41:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:34.149608", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 979, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10710, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4026, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>I stand corrected</b>\n\nMy bad, <a href=\"/u/elf_pavlik\">@elf_Pavlik</a>, and thanks for noticing.

Some of the protagonists are grassroots activists, social innovators, cultural practitioners and successful entrepreneurs. Others are deep state actors, veteran politicians and experienced civil servants. I have no idea what will happen when we come together at \\#lote4 next month but everyone is welcome to <a href=\"/welcome-to-lote4\">join us in shaping it here</a>.\n\nAhead of our gathering to share experiences and forge plans, I think it is important to flag that <strong>we need to learn new ways to think and talk about \"the future\".</strong>\n\nThis all came to a head last month during the KnowLab, an event organised by Unesco, supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (I was there as a participant and Edgeryders is involved in the project design and execution).\n\nWhat came out of the Knowlab is a powerful insight: not everybody can use the future \u2013 in fact most people cannot. The ability to do foresight, and learn from foresight done by others has to be forged. So I'm facilitating a session at LOTE4 on futures literacy.\n\nI have identified five waypoints on the way to <strong>futures literacy</strong> \u2013 each of them an ability itself. For each waypoint, we could interview wise or remarkable people ahead of LOTE4 and ask them how they acquired that particular ability.\n\nThe first ability is the ability to <strong>learn to look beyond one's construction of reality</strong>. We could learn how to develop it to network scientist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_J._Watts\">Duncan Watts</a>. Watts is the author of a book called <em>E</em><em>verything is obvious (once you know the answer),</em>\u00a0in which he passionately and convincingly argues that common sense is lousy at navigating situations that feature a great many agents interacting with each other. In those situations \u2013 which, not coincidentally, include <em>almost all</em>\u00a0real-life business and public policy decisions \u2013\u00a0common sense is actually a liability, and we need to learn to mistrust it and, instead, \"trust the data\".\n\nThe second ability is the ability to <strong>understand that the outlook on the future is contestable ground,\u00a0and why that matters for the present</strong>. We could ask how to do this to <a href=\"http://www.rielmiller.com/\">Riel Miller</a>, head of foresight at UNESCO. Riel has long cultivated a \"militant\" approach to foresight, and is convinced that the way we see the future will reverberate on present decisions, therefore <i>changing\u00a0</i>the future itself.\u00a0\n\nThe third ability is the ability to <strong>think like a complexity scientist</strong>, leaving behind narrativised accounts of reality and teaching oneself to recognise emergence\u00a0and self-organisation. We could ask how he did that to <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/champions/laureates/2012/Leeuw.asp\">Sander van der Leeuw</a>, archeologist of innovation, Santa Fe Institute scholar, and Dean of the School of sustainability at Arizona State University, who has relentlessly pursued a <em>very</em> long-term view on social and economic system dynamics \u2013 \u00a0and this has recently led him to conclude that \"innovation is a Ponzi scheme\".\u00a0\n\nThe fourth ability is the ability to <strong>learn from others already using the future</strong>. Here we draw on the experience of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiNc2ArMGck\">Giulio Quaggiotto</a>, currently heading the UN Pulse Lab. He has systematically worked to build an ecosystem of colleagues and practitioners of foresight (and other things) to learn from, with particular attention to outliers, radical experimenters and, recently... big data.\n\nThe fifth ability is the ability to <strong>manage the tension between the need for sense-making and the need to act</strong>. Perhaps we could ask <a href=\"http://re.silience.com/\">Vinay Gupta</a> how he developed his. He is a scholar and a practitioner of foresight, but he is also a doer, spearheading his own game-changing effort in the resilience crowd, particularly with the <a href=\"http://hexayurt.com/\">Hexayurt project</a>.\u00a0\n\nYes I know it's all men. I got the ball rolling now I need help from you to make this more diverse :)\n\nDo you have other people you would like to learn these abilities from? Why? Let us know who they are and what your reasons are for wanting to learn from then, and we will see what we can do to accommodate you.\n\nPlease share your thoughts in a comment below or email nadia@edgeryders.eu\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>", "created_at": "2014-09-23 08:42:46", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 15:48:52.957141", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 887, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10424, "user_id": 3421, "topic_id": 701, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Questions</b>\n\nWhat a wonderful job you're doing.

When housing, energy, transportation, real estate etc are sold, residents risk the danger of losing the capacity to design urban life with equal chances for everybody to participate in the long run. As an alternative to selling we think cities should give underused public spaces to citizens and associations, via project competitions. There is a lot of hidden potential of spaces that are underutilized at best, many times abandoned, or sold away without accountability of their future use. Many of these spaces, as shown by our friends at Impossible Living or in accounts of occupied Italian theatres, have historical or cultural value for the communities, and restoring them would bolster economic, social or recreational activity, as well as bring about a feeling of local cohesiveness. In Milan the city is <a href=\"http://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2012/09/29/news/comune_le_nuove_regole_per_gli_spazi_abbandonati-43494208/\">letting unused public buildings and venues for free</a>, with 30 year leases, to both associations and individuals with projects that benefit the city. This offsets maintenance costs and incentivizes tenants to renovate them, which in the long run increases their value. Can we do the same on a European level? This actionable is a blueprint for administrations to trust citizens to take responsibility for transforming and re-integrating public property into sustainable circuits. As a nice side effect, in many European cities this would help ameliorate conflicts and lessen potential for criminalisation of citizens making (arguably) illegal use of public property.\n\n<h2>Help prepare this topic \u2013 right here!</h2>Here's an EtherPad so you all can prepare this part of the LOTE2 \"Policy Hero Challenge\" together ... edit it right here!!

At this time we haven't developed a fixed approach to the peer-review process we'll be using for accepting pledges but rest assured this will be managed in a wholly transparent manner on the EdgeRyders platform.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>This pledge form asks that you make a proposal for what you will contribute to the unMonastery, in the form of a project - areas for project development have provisionally been defined as Internal, Interface and Outreach. We are leaving clear definition for what constitutes each area at this time up to you, since we believe that this should be a co-production process. But to give some guidance on how we currently understand how each area is characterised and set to function,\u00a0here are some examples:</span>\n\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<strong>Internal:</strong><span>\u00a0might relate to an urban permaculture project focused on food security for the unMonastery, equally it may focus on creating a methodology or an open source social template for reproduction of the unMonastery in the future.\u00a0</span>\n\n<strong>Interface:\u00a0</strong><span>could take as it\u2019s primary concern local integration, perhaps in the form of a mapping exercise of social assets in Matera or a series of convivial events designed to better bridge interaction between unMonasterians and the local population. This could also take the form of workshops with the local population focused on resilience, web design or something else that relates directly to your skillset.\u00a0</span>\n\n<strong>Outreach:</strong><span>\u00a0would explicitly be focused on the kinds of projects that will be enacted outside of the unMonastery during our time there. This could be anything from a street\u00a0thearter\u00a0production to finding a use for Matera's wealth of underground water supplies.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>It order to get a better understanding for what you might bring to the first unMonastery and the context, specifically in Matera, it's worth reading these posts about the location and other design issues, information available on the working group:\u00a0</span>\n\n<a href=\"https://unmonastery-unmonastery.pbworks.com/w/page/62074509/MT_Matera\">https://unmonastery-unmonastery.pbworks.com/w/page/62074509/MT_Matera</a><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<a href=\"https://unmonastery-unmonastery.pbworks.com/w/page/63923383/MT_Local%20issues%20to%20be%20solved\">https://unmonastery-unmonastery.pbworks.com/w/page/63923383/MT_Local%20issues%20to%20be%20solved</a><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>And from EdgeRyders early discussions (forgive the cache version, they're old EdgeRyder posts):\u00a0</span>\n\n<a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8NJu0UrtGcsJ:edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/unmonastery-some-design-issues+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk\">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8NJu0UrtGcsJ:edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/unmonastery-some-design-issues+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk</a><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:YRdWx8-x1CQJ:edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/what-would-you-bring-unmonastery+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk\">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:YRdWx8-x1CQJ:edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/what-would-you-bring-unmonastery+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk</a>\n\n<span>We're excited to be putting this initial call out and very much look forward to receiving your proposals!\u00a0</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-07 13:14:02", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 05:37:15.345358", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 829, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4, 81], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24098, "user_id": 3122, "topic_id": 5211, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Coming to LOTE5</b>\n\nI have a background in privacy, security, open data, machine-learning, and Lean UX.

The <a href=\"/t/lote4-dashboard/3113\">dashboard</a> is amazing, and growing by the day. As is appropriate for the early stages of conference organizing, we are still focusing on the \"important\" stuff like the program, communication, hackathons and logistics. I would suggest we make collaboration it even more amazing by opening up the way for people with different skills and inclinations to also shine. There are two missing teams that I think would make a major contribution to LOTE4:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>The Gadget Squad</strong>. If a conference lacks stickers, it's missing out! And what about T-shirts? Bags? Other cool stuff? This could be an area for some members in our community to get creative. Also, it can pay for itself, many people will willingly spend 15-20 EUR for a cool object to bring home. Gadget can even be pre-ordered, so we know how many to manufacture.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>The Party Line</strong>. Look, I am as serious and intense as the next guy, but even I realise a good party is a great way to bring the community together. In LOTE3 we wanted to throw a Halloween party, but in the end the volunteers were so busy with other stuff that the chance simply slipped away. To make a party happen, we need a group of people that <em>focus</em> on the party, and make it their line of conduct: set us up with djs, find the equipment, print the flyers, the whole lot.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI can think of several people in the community who would be good at one or both of these tasks. <a href=\"/u/zoescope\">@zoescope</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"/u/susa\">@Susa</a>\u00a0would rock in the gadgetry department, whereas <a href=\"/u/toolosophy\">@TOOLosophy</a>\u00a0could treat us to edgy post-Soviet djing and <a href=\"/u/bembo_davies\">@Bembo Davies</a>, of course, is always up for bringing people together. But, as always, who does the work calls the shots: I don't want to make decisions for anybody (I can't, since I am not doing this particular work), but I did want to signal that we are more than open to it. LOTE4 will be serious work, but that does not mean we are not supposed to have some fun while we do it!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-10 13:24:17", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:20.185768", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 413, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 35.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7285, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 2265, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Just like my geek/hacker's retreats :) </b>\n\nperfect !\n\nyou can count me in !\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-10 23:53:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:42.831037", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16193, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5169, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Anyway: fixed</b>\n\nGoing back to where we were: default is with OpenCare logo and group menu, but same layout as standard nodes.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-21 02:02:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:30.818815", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1714, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1681, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" height=\"377\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/monk_by_sukanto_debnath.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"500\">\n\nWhile I wait around for the green light on a prototype Unmonastery in Matera 2013, I have been thinking about how to design such a thing. It is inevitable: people I mentioned it to have been asking questions - and since there is absolutely no precedent, all answers have to be made up from scratch. Provisionally, I would group them into three categories.\n\n<h3>What kind of projects?</h3>Quite naturally, people want to know if their pet project would be welcome at the Unmonastery. Can I finish to write my book? Can I learn to cook Thai? Can I experiment with a new way of growing carrots? Some projects are difficult to fit into the mould for practical reasons: for example, if yours entails growing bonsais you are likely to need a longer time that the prototype Unmonastery has to offer. If you want to build a Lego particle accelerator, you are likely to need more space than we would be given. For others there are no physical constraints, and the choice is a little more difficult. A fundamental decision is whether to allow people to join the Unmonastery to do something that does not require the collaborations of others unSisters and unBrothers, but simply peace and quiet. This was part of the landscape of monasteries, after all: I guess people who wanted to be left alone to meditate on whatever it is they wanted to meditate on gave their monasteries something in return, maybe something as simple as another pair of arms for the daily chores. In the case of the Unmonastery, though, the whole point is for the whole to be greater than the sum of its parts - so, in a sense, somebody finishing away her book and not interacting much with anyone in the process is somehow wasteful. Difficult one. My hunch is that an effort should be made to bake into the deal with interesting people searching for peace something that they can contribute to the whole project, maybe something unexpected.\n\n<h3>What kind of institution?\u00a0</h3>A fully successful prototype Unmonastery turns into a new institution that fills a previously empty niche in society. Though this will emerge (or not) at least as much as it is designed, a lot of thinking needs to be given to how to organize an Unmonastery. Some decisions appear to be very down-to-earth, but they actually contribute to the cultural wiring. For example: who does the dishes? Is it better to hunt for funding to hire cleaning staff or demand that unmonks and un-nuns contribute to the keeping of the house? There is a cultural element there: if you take turns in washing everyone's dishes, somehow you go deeper into the feeling of community. Or: can people bring their children? Of course it is more welcoming to allow monks and nuns to bring along their offspring: on the other hand, given limited capacity, children might be displacing other potential unmonks.\u00a0\n\n<h3>What relationship with the local community?</h3>As Eimhin pointed out, no point in \"installing solutions\". People want to be part of discovering and mounting solutions together with the local community. So how is this managed? How do we make sure that somebody from, say, Ireland, who does not speak any Italian and spends one month in the Unmonastery in Matera has a meaningful interaction with the locals? At a minimum, we need not one UnAbbott/UnAbbess, but two: one from the nascent Unmonastery global community, to manage people coming and going, and one from the local community, to connect the dots. But there are many, many more choices to make. Do we start by making a list of issues people in Matera are working on? Do we aim at sharing new, strange (for them) things which they are presently not engaged with \u00a0- but which could be life-changing? Here is a particularly intriguing one: do unmonks/un-nuns wear attires that clearly identify them as such? It seems weird, but it could be a great way of signifiying \"it's ok to talk to me, I am here to make something new in this place\".\u00a0\n\nAny ideas?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-08-01 15:08:05", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 05:48:41.142384", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 731, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4492, "user_id": 2654, "topic_id": 4459, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi guys, I work at a non profit in Kathmandu called Women LEAD Nepal that works to empower young women in Nepal.

I had stored it in a drawer of my mind, almost as if it were part of another life. All this time, I have not looked back.\n\nIt feels weird, to go back in time, and observe the event of the past, which shaped a future, but with different eyes.\n\nMore than ever, I am convinced that a unique ideological thinking at the expense of diversification of ideas does not give good results. This is what the Quebec legislator has forced artists to do: to come together under one roof, ignoring ideologies and different types of aesthetics, and creative behaviors. Thus very innovative artists, an extremely dynamic network community-based, met individuals with the opposite of their sets of values\u200b\u200b. They were forced to set aside their ideologies to fit the law.\n\nOh, another very strange thing. I looked at my picture from 20 years ago.

Thus was legally born RCAAQ, the Regroupement des centres d'artistes autog\u00e9r\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec, in September 29, 1986.\n\nRCAAQ, has a reputation based on expertise of more than 20 years in contemporary art and actual art. It has become, over the years, the meeting point of a network of centers sixty artists and cultural organizations located throughout the province of Quebec, representing a community of interest of over 2250 professional artists and cultural workers. The network annually produces more than 800 activities including exhibitions, performances, publications, symposia and has a continuing education program for both cultural workers and professional artists.\n\nThe combat between AADRAV and RAAV (Regroupement des centres d'artistes du Qu\u00e9bec), took place under Bill 78 on the Status of the Artist, while RCAAQ was lobbying to obtain a cultural policy and the creation of CALQ (Conseil des arts et des lettres du Qu\u00e9bec).\n\nThe combat has been described as \"<em>a cloud</em> <em>of intolerance</em> <em>in</em> <em>a puree of</em> <em>politeness</em>\" by Lise Lamarche (in ETC, n\u00b0 23, 1993 (ref <a

the time I arrived in this community, the battle for recognition of an association of artists according to the law on the status of the artist had begun several years ago. I contacted the network of artists in 1992, when one of my artworks was censored by the Women's Center of Concordia University. I was beleaguered by journalists throughout the country, who tried to understand if my artwork was \"politically correct\" or not. Bastien Gilbert, the general manager of RCAAQ, gave me some advice.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://blog.reverberacoes.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Bastien_01.jpeg\" style=\"width: 316px; height: 469px;\"> Bastien Gilbert\n\nShortly after I met Bastien Gilbert, I was asked to pay a very high business tax by the City of Montreal, for my tiny artist's studio, which I was using both as workshop and residence. All Montreal artists have been taxed at the same time as me. It is precisely for this reason that I got involved with the RCAAQ and AADRAV, and I quickly found myself elected president of the association of artists.\n\nGilles Arteau, a multidisciplinary artist, was president of RCAAQ from 1991 to 1994.\n\nI was president of AADRAV from 1993 to 1995. My stay was very short, in the cannevas of the history of Quebec visual artists.\n\nThe Commission for recognition of associations artists is an organization created in December 1989 by the <a href=\"http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=/S_32_01/S32_01.html\"><span><span><span><span>Loi sur le statut professionnel des artistes des arts visuels, des m\u00e9tiers d'art et de la litt\u00e9rature et sur leurs contrats avec les diffuseurs\u00a0 </span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span>L.R.Q., chapitre\u00a0</span><span>S-32.01</span></span></span></span> to designate which association or group will represent the artists in each area covered by the this Law.\n\nIn the field covered, the recognized association or group has the following functions:\n\n1 \u00b0 to ensure the maintenance of the honor of the artistic profession and freedom of its exercise;\n\n2 \u00b0 promote the achievement of conditions conducive to the creation and dissemination of works;\n\n3 \u00b0 to defend and promote the economic, social, moral and professional artists;\n\n4 \u00b0 representing professional artists whenever it is of general interest to do so.\n\nAt the arrival of the new bill, in 1989, besides RCAAQ, there was five disciplinary councils: the Council of Painting of Quebec, the Council of Sculpture of Quebec, the Council of Textile arts of Quebec, the Council of Printmaking of Quebec\u00a0 and the Association of Illustrators of Quebec.\n\nIn 1990, to apply for accreditation to the Commission for the recognition of artists' associations, the artists involved in the network of artist-run centers RCAAQ created AADRAV.\n\nMeanwhile, the five disciplinary councils created RAAV (Regroupement des centres d'artistes autog\u00e9r\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec).\n\nBoth groups presented an application for recognition under S-32.01.\n\nIn 1991, RAAV became an association of individuals and adopted its current name.\n\n<span><span>The</span> <span>Labour Relations</span> <span>Commission</span> <span>is</span> <span>the competent court</span> <span>to decide on</span> <span>applications for recognition</span> <span>under</span> <span>Act</span></span>. The law establishes that only one association can be designated by the Commission to represent artists of Quebec. The association with the largest number of members wins the designation.\n\n<span><span>The</span> <span>association or group asking for recognition</span> <span>must</span> <span>apply to the Commission </span><span>by</span><span> writing</span> <span>with</span><span>:</span>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - <span>a</span> <span>resolution signed by</span> <span>authorized representatives</span> <span>of the</span> <span>association or group;</span>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - <span>a</span> <span>certified copy of</span> <span>its regulations;</span>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0 <span>the</span> <span>list of its members</span></span>.\n\n<strong>Here was the heart of the problem, article 11 of the Act:</strong>\n\n<div class=\"Pt\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong><em><span><span>11</span><span>.</span></span><span>\u00a0</span><span>La Commission accorde la reconnaissance \u00e0 l'association ou au regroupement qui est le plus repr\u00e9sentatif de l'ensemble des artistes professionnels oeuvrant dans un domaine.</span></em></strong></div>\n\n<div class=\"Pt\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div class=\"Pt\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong><em><span>L'association la plus repr\u00e9sentative est celle qui, de l'avis de la Commission, groupe le plus grand nombre d'artistes professionnels du domaine vis\u00e9 et dont les membres sont le mieux r\u00e9partis parmi le plus grand nombre de pratiques artistiques et sur la plus grande partie du territoire du Qu\u00e9bec.</span></em></strong></div>\n\n<div class=\"Pt\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div class=\"Pt\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong><em><span>Le regroupement le plus repr\u00e9sentatif est celui qui de l'avis de la Commission regroupe les associations les plus repr\u00e9sentatives du plus grand nombre de pratiques artistiques du domaine.</span></em></strong></div>\n\nThe 5 disciplinary councils paid for an automatic subscription of their members to RAAV, while RCAAQ was asking each artist to become a member of AADRAV of its own free will. RCAAQ was not able to gather as many artists as RAAV. Not many were missing to match the number of RAAV members, but still, AADRAV had less. But it was more dynamic, since almost all innovators --- the wild creators --- were very actively engaged in the artist-run center's network, as they were creating contemporary and actual art. But they had less members than RAAV. So, no matter their value, all that matter in the face of the law, were numbers. The legislator did not care at all about the value of cultural production when it proposed Bill 78.\n\nIn 1993, the Commission granted the status to RAAV as the recognized body.\n\nAADRAV appealed to Superior court. <span><span>The application was</span> <span>dismissed</span><span>.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>The lawyer representing </span><span>AADRAV</span> <span>died</span> <span>shortly after. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>Two</span> <span>defeats</span> <span>in the courts</span><span>.</span> <span>And</span> a <span>deceased</span> <span>lawyer</span><span>.</span> <span>There was</span> <span>no further</span> <span>option</span> <span>other than</span> <span>to</span> <span>change the</span> Act <span>on the status</span> <span>of the artist</span><span>,</span> <span>who had</span> <span>recently</span> <span>been adopted</span><span>.</span> <span>Artists </span><span>capitulated</span> <span>and</span> <span>had no other choice but to accept</span> <span>the demands </span><span>of the Minister</span> <span>of Culture</span><span>.</span></span>\n\n\u201c<em>We ended up</em><em> two rival factions that had two very different conceptions of community life, in a context where community life in the visual arts was very dynamic, extremely active. \u00a0For instance, I think about the presence of the disciplinary councils and art centers, with different views and activities. We had very different positions, but yet, we were aware that we had the desire to find solutions to improve the socioeconomic conditions of artists. The Act on the status of the artist had put us in a position of opposition. Finally, our divergence was settled in court. The Commission ruled recognition in favor of RAAV, but still we benefited from an accommodation from the Minister of Culture of the time, who wanted an environment that was supportive of all factions. Therefore, the Minister arranged for openings in the board of administrators, in order for AADRAV leaders to be integrated at RAAV</em>.\u201d (Gaetan Gosselin, video <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvPRsgisCLg\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvPRsgisCLg</a>)\n\nMembers of AADRAV gradually adhered to RAAV before dissolving their association in 1995.\n\nA fundamental difference of attitude and expectation regarding meeting the needs of support for the structuring and supporting the profession is currently facing the Council of Sculpture at the Quebec Council of Arts and Letters. CALQ ceased to support the Council of Sculpture of Quebec, which has no more access to aid programs in operation.\n\nIn 1995, after I intensely\u00a0 performed lobbying for two years, the government of Quebec agreed to modify the bill on municipal taxation, which has then enabled all Quebec municipalities to create regulations to exempt artists' studios of the business taxes.\n\nMoreover, the government also agreed to reimburse retroactively visual artists who paid business taxes between 1993 to 1995. The sum amounted to over half a million dollars.\n\nRAAV had not made \u200b\u200bany efforts to amend the law on municipal taxation and to recognize the artists' studios. I spent two full years of my life to this cause. I attended weekly night meetings of the council of the city of Montreal, I intervened in a parliamentary committee of the National Assembly, I wrote hundreds of letters, I even built a model of an artist's studio for each of the 51 councilors. I met a hundred councilors and members of parliament.\n\nThe half million dollars was awarded to RAAV, and I had no role in its management. Totally disgusted, I left the cultural milieu, and I have not done another visual artwork since 1995. I saw no future as a visual artist.\n\n<strong>CONCLUSION</strong>\n\nWith bill 78 on the status of visual artists, the government of Quebec tried to squarely rule arts practice in Quebec and thus created a real diversion from the real problem. The concerns of the artists are not confined solely to terms of contracts, a market of cultural products or exemplary management career.\n\nThe art scene reproduced on another scale, the same phenomenon we often see across political parties or another, a clan or another, where roosters squabble while the other, the voters, or in this case the artists, continue to be indifferent to what goes on (or not).\n\nBut the government is not solely responsible for the problems faced by the visual artists. The lack of social involvement and indifference: even artists have a rightful responsibility to take part in democratic life. With the death of AADRAV, the art scene really hit the extreme, the bottom of the bottom. AADRAV died for lack of combatants. And meanwhile, nearly 20 years later, it is still difficult to obtain a deep dialogue between artists and the government about art, or its practice, or its content.\n\n\u201c<em>I keep a pretty good memory of the vitality of the team (from 20 years ago). I still remember it with nostalgia, as it is now in a context where it is less easy, with the new means of communication, and the rise of ideological tendencies from the Right, or more individualistic views.</em>\n\n<em>If I had a message for the next generation (not necessarily the youth), I would say that you should take action. Do not think too long before doing something, to defend the issues that are tapered around artistic creation. I believe in the constructive value of collective action because it helps break the loneliness of artists who are sometimes quite alone in their studios, in favor of a concerted effort affecting the future, which helps develop a vision of the future. Sometimes governments think that there are too many artists associations, but there aren\u2019t. These associations have a rightful mission to carry</em>.\u201d, concluded Gaetan Gosselin.\n\nMeanwhile, political parties<span> <span>in Quebec</span> get multiplied <span>like mushrooms</span></span>: <span><span>the Liberal party</span><span>,</span> <span>the</span> <span>Parti Quebecois</span><span>,</span> <span>the</span> <span>Democratic Action</span> <span>of</span> <span>Quebec</span><span>,</span> <span>Quebec</span> <span>solidarity</span><span>,</span> <span>and the Coalition</span> <span>for the future of</span> <span>Quebec</span><span>,</span> <span>not to mention </span>more <span>minor</span> <span>parties</span><span>.</span></span> <span><span>Citizens should demand that </span><span>all these parties </span><span>rally behind</span> <span>a single</span> <span>political ideology</span><span>, and the one with the most members gets to be in power... j</span><span>ust</span> <span>to see</span> <span>what they would do</span><span>.</span></span> \\#justsaying!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-11 00:10:57", "updated_at": "2017-09-13 11:06:10.065509", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33596, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 100.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 694, "user_id": 3265, "topic_id": 661, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<i>\u201cDon\u2019t assume a person with a disability is easily offended.\u201d</i>\n\n<i>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2014\u201cDisability Etiquette\u201d from Wikipedia.\u00a0</i>\n\n\u00a0\n\nAt the beginning of the research, we asked ourselves, \u201cWhat is disability?\u201dAccording to <i>Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Care </i>by Bachrach Miller, the terms regarding disability are defined as such:\n\n\u201cImpairment is the correct term to use to define a deviation from normal, such as not being able to make a muscle move\u2026Disability is the term used to define a restriction in the ability to perform a normal activity of daily living which someone of the same age is able to perform. \u2026 Handicap is the term used to describe a child or adult who, because of the disability, is unable to achieve the normal role in society commensurate with his age and socio-cultural milieu\u2026All disabled people are impaired, and all handicapped people are disabled, but a person can be impaired and not necessarily be disabled, and a person can be disabled without being handicapped.\u201d[1]\n\nNowadays, more and more people begin to pay attention to how to address people with disabilities. The use of \u201cpeople-first language\u201d* in English aims to \u201cavoid the subconscious dehumanization when discussing people with disabilities\u201d[2]. However, as the researches continue and after we interviewed a few people with disabilities, we soon realized that language is not really a problem. Every person we interviewed all said that the word \u201cdisability\u201d doesn\u2019t bother them at all and they don\u2019t mind being called \u201cdisabled\u201d because it is a fact. (<span>Interview with Raul Krauthausen</span> by @Moriel).\n\nSo here is the question, if the language / term / vocabulary doesn't matter as much as we think, where does the problem really lies?\n\nAnother example would be: why is it okay to say someone has dark hair but not okay to say someone is a gay or someone is a black especially in the western countries? It is because people who used these terms earlier in the history had a strong prejudice and discrimination in mind. In the end, language was created to describe things as how they are. There is nothing wrong with language itself if people don\u2019t think otherwise to begin with.\n\nCould it be that some of us\u2014people without physical disabilities\u2014think that the current terms we use are offensive is because we are subconsciously offending them in the first place? So the question is not how to change the language, or other visible things. The question is how we can change people\u2019s opinion.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n* For example: use \u201ca person with a vision impairment\u201d instead of \u201ca blind person\u201d\n\n1.<a href=\"http://gait.aidi.udel.edu/gaitlab/cpGuide.html\">http://gait.aidi.udel.edu/gaitlab/cpGuide.html</a>\n\n2.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People-first_language\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People-first_language</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a group project on going \\#able with @Moriel, @ChristineOehme and @Luise Kr\u00f6ning\u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-31 23:00:10", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 13:55:51.929191", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 582, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25771, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5596, "post_number": 27, "raw": "<b>Very cool! </b>\n\nI never did a deploy before!

The aim of the three-day forum is to bring together African futures thinkers, \u00a0and practitioners to explore how \u00a0the \u201cdiscipline of anticipation\u201d has been shaped and applied in Africa and how it can be deliberately leveraged towards \u00a0transforming \u00a0Africa\u2019s future onto more positive trajectories.\u00a0\n\nMy personal aim is to reach out to our peers on the continent, compare notes and see what we could build together. \u00a0I\"ll be tweeting and posting summaries of the discussions here throughout the three days.\n\nI don't know if anyone will be documenting the contents of my presentation so very briefly my main points about the Edgeryders/ Spot The Future version of futurism are:\n\n1.<strong> immediate future-oriented</strong>. We don't forecast, we nowcast: people on the edge of change find each other traversing the social graph and compare notes on how they go about solving the problems they care about. This conversation carries information about the near future, because change starts at the edge \u2013 at the center the established dynamics of society and the economy are dominant, and so it is harder to perceive the coming changes. We are part of this conversation because we are them.\n\n2. <strong>action-oriented.</strong> We are first and foremost a community of changemakers. We don't do futurism to pursue academic interests: we do it as intelligence that helps shape our own projects, the companies we start or dissolve, the collective action we do or don't.\u00a0\n\n3. <strong>crowdsourced and ad-hoc</strong>. We may occasionally employ professional analysts, but at the heart of our method are networks of self-selected citizen experts, who form ourselves around any interesting problem we throw at the community. This means our futurism is \"underground\" and generally not politically correct.\n\n4.<strong> proven to work</strong>. During STF we dug out cutting-edge grassroots- and civic innovators in countries where we had never been, whose language we did not speak and in the space of a few weeks.\u00a0\n\n5. <strong>Technology-oriented.</strong> This is not a bias but a result. We have found open source tech to be a key enabler for these communities, as it gives them a lot of extra reach. So we pay a lot of attention to it.\n\nIf you are at the \\#AllAfricaFutures Forum and want to find me Im tweeting as @Ladyniasan.\n\nWish me luck!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-24 09:02:20", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 23:51:03.274755", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 515, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 15.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23690, "user_id": 2656, "topic_id": 4464, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Ora intalnirii era 17, corect?

community expects interesting additions! We will soon have innovators from Armenia, Egypt and Georgia joining us, and together we\u2019ll find and highlight citizen solutions to challenges in their countries.

The kinds of ground-breaking initiatives whose impact can go beyond any local context or regional agenda and serve as inspiration for more and larger scale creative collaborations. Simply stated, it offers us more opportunities to come together, inspire one another and help each other. P2p.</span>\n\n<span>This is one of many signs that </span><strong>Edgeryders is developing into an independent, grassroots-driven and self-sustaining voice</strong><span> for people at the edge everywhere...and we are very happy about it.</span>\n\n<span>The story behind these news is this: In the context of a </span><a href=\"http://post2015.org/\"><u>post 2015</u></a><span> Development agenda, also known as what comes after the Millenium Goals, UNDP held a global online consultation last year, called </span><a href=\"http://www.worldwewant2015.org/\"><u>World We Want</u></a><span>. They asked citizens \u201cWhat would make your future better?\u201d and engaged almost two million worldwide. In the follow-up, UNDP Europe and Central Asia are embarking on a project to involve the consulted as solution finders at local level (irrespective of credentials) and believing strongly that \u201cthe future is already here \u2013 it\u2019s just not very evenly distributed\u201d (W Gibson). Seems right up our alley, doesn\u2019t it?</span>\n\n<span>Edgeryders is proposing a foresight exercise called \u201cSpot the Future\u201d: we will be opening our web home to the fresh voices of social innovators in the three countries, engage them in a global conversation and figure out together what works and what doesn\u2019t when hacking systemic challenges. We\u2019ll present the findings as valuable inspiration for the UN\u2019s development programmes across Europe, and not least, for people who are building the future everywhere.</span>\n\n<span>All throughout this exercise, we advocate to use our </span><a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/116460126/ENGAGING-THE-CITIZEN-EXPERT-A-user%E2%80%99s-manual-for-the-European-scale\"><u>proven</u></a><span> methodology, based on three main activities:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Traverse the social graph to identify cutting-edge trends as they happen.</strong><span> We reach out to these trend makers, and do not ask them what they think is needed for progress. We ask them what they are already doing!</span></li>\n\n<li><strong>Peer validation through curated conversation.</strong><span> By embedding the Spot the Future innovators into the Edgeryders web community we provoke all kinds of meaningful exchanges: anything written by one user can be corroborated or challenged by all others.</span></li>\n\n<li><strong>Uncover insights through online ethnography and network analysis.</strong><span> With our tools, we detect and harvest the (hidden) knowledge in these online conversations. For example: What are the trends in citizen-driven innovation in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia? What are the biggest obstacles for the innovators there? What would help them grow the impact of their work?</span></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>What do we aim to achieve?</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><strong>a fledgling network that connects people </strong>doing innovative work at the edges<strong> across Armenia, Egypt and Georgia</strong></span></li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><strong>discovery of unknown societal challenges and exchange of new perspectives</strong>, knowledge and solutions, across countries</span></li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><strong>emergent, bottom up collaboration between the Spot the Future protagonists and Edgeryders wider community</strong>. (Georgian unMonasteries, anyone?!)</span></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>How can the community members get involved?</strong>\n\n<span>From end of March, [Matthias] will have a new dedicated space on the edgeryders.eu website ready where social innovators from the three countries share their stories. The conversation will be global, open and more importantly, compelling for Edgeryders everywhere, so we all stand to benefit. What\u2019s more, doors are wide open for us to interact and exchange advice with new Armenian, Georgian and Egyptian community members.</span>\n\n<span>We\u2019ll soon be launching specific calls to point at detailed ways anyone can be a part of this. But if you know of interesting people pushing for change in any of the three countries, and who could use the immersion in a global community and lots of peer support, invite them in! </span><strong>Simply share this post and encourage them to come meet and greet everyone through a comment here. </strong>\n\n<span>Finally, it\u2019s worth saying that we\u2019re excited about this opportunity to work with the UNDP Regional Office in Bratislava (our formal contractor) and the country offices in Georgia, Armenia, Egypt. By doing so, we hope to inspire a new way of how institutions collaborate with citizens doing cutting-edge work outside the mainstream, and set the tone so that they are given increasing support, credibility and legitimacy. Also at Edgeryders we're big on collaboration so if you want to engage other organisations you know of to partner with the initiative and welcome more Edgeryders in more countries to the community do write to nadia@edgeryders.eu.</span>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/RvhhuJgHPDw?feature=player_embedded\n\n<em>Post co-written with [Matthias] and [Nadia].</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-05 07:53:02", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:13.248876", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1293, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 97.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1457, 5, 315, 1933], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9576, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 648, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>The tool collection should not be difficult, but..</b>\n\n..do you think you could get\u00a0permission?\u00a0\n\nAnother think that you might consider was\u00a0pointed out by Alex (volunteer\u00a0in Calais/ Dunkirk camps)\u00a0in a response to Milan's similar efforts: \"My suggestion is first\u00a0to ask them how you can help, rather than guessing.

Il vous regarde droit dans les yeux. Malgr\u00e9 sa grande stature, ses yeux sont pleins de bont\u00e9 et vous n'y trouverez aucune trace d'arrogance. Il n'a que 23 ans, mais vous seriez surpris \u00e0 quel point il semble mature. Andrei vit \u00e0 Klausenburg, Cluj, en Roumanie, et il est originaire de Orhei, et est \u00e0 la recherche d'opportunit\u00e9s dans le domaine du d\u00e9veloppement international et ce qui concerne la paix et les conflits.

Par la suite, il r\u00e9pondra calmement, en pesant chaque mot.\n\nAndrei termine des \u00e9tudes en relations internationales. Il semble avoir choisi la bonne discipline qui lui convient. Il a devin\u00e9 d'embl\u00e9e qu'il est en mesure d'incarner le bon sens et qu'il est outill\u00e9 pour aider les gens \u00e0 s'accorder. Peut-\u00eatre que je me trompe... aurait-il l'\u00e9toffe d'un ambassadeur? Il \u00e9coute respectueusement et j'appr\u00e9cie le fait qu'il n'est pas un moulin \u00e0 paroles. Je suis persuad\u00e9e qu'il ne s'avancerait pas avec des d\u00e9clarations non fond\u00e9es ou non pertinentes.\n\nEn plus, il a un \u0153il per\u00e7ant pour discerner les situations qui manquent de substance. Il vous sert le plus naturellement du monde du jamais vu sur certaines choses, auxquelles personne n'a encore jamais song\u00e9 auparavant. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'entrevois que cela pourrait lui permettre de d\u00e9velopper un sens aigu de l'\u00e9valuation et la capacit\u00e9 de composer avec des zones grises: ce qu'il faut pour jongler avec l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9.\n\nIl sait \u00e9galement reconna\u00eetre la valeur des gens et il est capable d'exprimer des commentaires positifs \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. Andrei, qui a choisi de s'appeler @TOOLosophy sur Twitter, est capable d'observer attentivement et de garder son sang froid dans les situation, tout en trouvant la bonne chose \u00e0 faire ou \u00e0 dire. M\u00eame s'il s'exprime avec prudence et discernement, il poss\u00e8de de la souplesse, ce qui laisse envisager qu'il d\u00e9veloppera probablement des habilet\u00e9s pour les compromis et la n\u00e9gociation.\n\n<em>Expliquez-nous ce qui vous pla\u00eet chez Andrei.

The city, divided into two parts by the river Mtkvari, suffers from the stereotypical soviet building block color grey. Especially on its \"new\" side, where the high rises orderly planned, reminiscent of what an uninformed outsider would think the whole post-soviet region looks like.\n\nAnd Meri, a university student and part of the student governing body at Rustavi University Rvali, isn't the only one during our first event in Rustavi, who believes the city of 120.000 is missing some color. The 12th graders we talk to at public school \\#4 also believe a more colorful city would make their hometown more exciting.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of ideas to create a city they wish for, they envision, they dream off. Nino, whose height does not compare with her courage to be the first to speak as 12th grader to a group of \u2018old\u2019 international english speakers, immediately says she wants a cinema. She is tired of going on a 40 minute trip to the capital Tbilisi to watch a movie. But it\u2019s not just watching a movie, we learn from the others we talk to during the first day, it\u2019s the experience. The popcorn, the cafes.\n\nBut the challenge, we learn during our later meeting with the youth department of city hall, isn\u2019t that the government has not tried to set it up. \u201cWe organized an open air cinema, but no one showed up, and we even called people,\u201d the head of the department explains us.\n\nSo, what would happen if we give the people with the ideas, the residents, the possibility to create and develop what they want themselves?Or as Livingstreets Pieter keeps reminding us: to have the government, as they agreed in Ghent with their project, to make <strong>nothing impossible</strong>.\n\nAnd that opens the minds of the students and high schoolers we talk to.\n\nWhat they wish for:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tA green city</li>\n\n<li>\tA colorful city</li>\n\n<li>\tA mobile, easy to navigate, city</li>\n\n<li>\tA healthy city</li>\n\n<li>\tA humane city</li>\n\n<li>\tA city of communities</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhat visions they have:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tMore (open) outdoor spaces, improving the squares, making it enjoyable to walk</li>\n\n<li>\tOpening a modern library with up-to-date books, a comfy reading space, a nice cafe</li>\n\n<li>\tBook-sharing, with a cafe</li>\n\n<li>\tBiking lanes</li>\n\n<li>\tSwimming pools</li>\n\n<li>\tCinema\u2019s, entertainment centers</li>\n\n<li>\tRenewable energy</li>\n\n<li>\tLive music</li>\n\n<li>\tCleaning the lake</li>\n\n<li>\tFree courses for youth</li>\n\n<li>\tA zoo</li>\n\n<li>\tA tennis court</li>\n\n<li>\tStreet music</li>\n\n<li>\t<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ11f6urLVQ\">A dog food vending machine for street dogs</a>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uulC-9oU8KM\">Free haircuts for those who can\u2019t afford it</a>\n</li>\n\n<li>\tA participatory bakery and workshop</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhat they are working on now:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tBook sharing.

We also use some undocumented online tools and practices...\n\nAt this moment I consider our signal to noise ratio rather poor. All of those tools have various advantages and disadvantages and while particular tools fit some purposes better they fail short to serve other ones. I must admit that we never documented our workflows well neither took time for proper upskilling.\n\nTo address this issue I would like to create a <strong>focused workstream</strong> with maximum preferably max 4-5 people and come up with recommendations together. I hope that <span>@Kei</span>,\u00a0<a href=\"/u/ben\">@Ben</a>,\u00a0@K, <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>, <a href=\"/u/dorotea\">@Dorotea</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/marc\">@Marc</a>\u00a0can join us on that. I would also like that we define clearly <strong>interfaces and audiences</strong>\u00a0since I don't believe that we can find <strong>one size fits all</strong> solution here. For example to interact with general community in Matera we like it or not but we need to use Facebook, possibly we can also leverage <a href=\"http://www.matera-basilicata2019.it/\">MT2019</a> platform (<a href=\"/t/new-residencies-proposal-from-our-todays-irl-meeting/2998\">especially since 2 more people speaking italian and with good local connections may move in very soon</a>). We can't also expect everyone to pay attention to ER platform, one person I can think as an example - <a href=\"/u/piersoft\">@piersoft</a>\u00a0who on the other hand stays very responsive over Twitter and Facebook.\n\nWe also need to find clear way for experimenting with new tools and upgrading our setup. Lately <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/t/heads-up-matera-events-in-open-data/3000\">proposed additional interface for publishing events</a>\u00a0and I would find it useful to know if he could easily get information about our current setup and requirements we may want/need to address (again Facebook comes in and need to publish events there). I doubt since we currently don't have it well documented :(\n\nMyself and possibly other people (<a href=\"/u/marc\">@Marc</a>?) feel irritated about misuse/abuse of channels which everyone pays attention to <span>\u00a0(hopefully still)</span>. Things like asking to make sure that someone takes projector cable for some event over main mailing list creates unnecessary noise. Trello for example provides much more granular way of subscribing/unsubscribing to relevant notifications and features like checklists to keep track on stuff like that.\n\nI also find it rather upsetting that while I get tons of information about missing cables etc. Hearing about <a href=\"/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359-the-stewardship\">#LOTE4 happening in unMonastery in October</a> makes me scratch my head and feel sort of confused: <em>unMonastery in Matera? do we speak about\u00a0Complesso del Casale???...</em>\n\nFor <strong>front facing</strong> communication/feedback channels we also can improve our strategy.

I would definitely be interested in a presentation.\u00a0\n\nI checked out the Remarkable Lives website. It's great reading \u2013 stories of humans are always interesting. I wonder: what's your plan for interaction? What happens if I think Jean or Derek seem\u00a0cool, and I want to reach out? I saw there is support for sharing the story on FB/TW, but that does not make a connection with the Remarkable People themselves.\n\nBTW: in pre-Internet days, I was a musician. My band was a sort of Italian version of The Pogues, keenly interested in a \"folk\" collective narration of Italian recent history. We are almost an amnesiac country, and it is hard to gain access to first-hand experiences from the messy times of war, Nazi occupation, partisan guerrilla, collaborationists etc. Long story short, I started\u00a0asking around and ended up in the house of Germano Nicolini, a former partisan commander and Resistance hero, later disgraced because suspected guilty of the political murder of a priest (happened in 1946), and finally found innocent (after 10 years in jail) in the mid 1990s, 50 years after the crime. No Google, no six\u00a0degrees, no nothing. We wrote and published a fairly successful song about Nicolini's story. It put him on the radar of popular culture: while not exactly a celebrity, he became a respected voice, one of too few real elders in the Italian left's tribe.\n\nHe now has his own <a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germano_Nicolini\">Wikipedia page</a>, but at the time he was floatsam and jetsam of history, just another freedom fighter gone bad. I am telling you this story because I understand the value of oral memory, and of personal relationship with the past. But I did need to wash up at Nicolini's doorstep, and ring his bell. I remember his initial guardedness: my story made sense to him (\"you are part of my history, I want a first hand account\"), but it was way out of his experience, as of my own.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-05 08:47:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:58.155461", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 367, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22811, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4905, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Noemi</b>\n\nCool.

It's there as a common resource, so feel free to share it. Also visible are the latest tweets about \\#edgeryders, a dynamic that keeps us connected to the outside world. From the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/show/missions\">Missions page</a> you can now access all missions completed so far by the community, and to make it even simpler for you we've begun redesigning mission briefs into more engaging formats.

As of now Edgeryders are able to post videos here, in addition to the usual text and images. This can be done simply by copy pasting embed codes and is an encouragement to use visuals whenever this feels easier to communicate (you can upload videos in your mission reports as well) As part of a fluid streaming we are now able to ping other users and engage them directly in conversations. You do this in the usual tweeting style \"@Username\" and next they are notified on their walls. Which takes me to the following point:</li>\n\n<li><strong>Functional notifications</strong> are in place to facilitate interaction; they ensure that a user is made aware every time another Edgeryder writes a message, comments on his mission reports or conversations in which he is involved. Notifications are sent by private email and they enable conversation to converge in different parts of the platform. Our common assumption here is that whenever you receive such a message, the nice thing to do is go on the platform and engage with the people involved in a conversation with you. The greatest gift to the community is paying attention and engaging with its members. Once you sign up, you should pass through the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/group/welcome-group\">Welcome Group</a> and let people know you, see what others are doing, find your way through their transition experiences.. you'll definitely feel the need to share yours.

A place which is a victim of capitalism</div>\n\n<div>was transformed for a day into a free site where brotherhood and democracy gave master</div>\n\n<div>classes. The icing on the cake was the installation of a cardboard dome to protect those who</div>\n\n<div>had been living there for 22 days from the rain and frost. Ever since the opening of the camp</div>\n\n<div>site at Paris, one thing was made clear: we would not be allowed to put up tents or use timber</div>\n\n<div>and derivatives, since the police consider them as dangerous objects and materials.

So, here it goes. As I am still a student due to graduate this summer, I will focus on the \u2018ryde\u2019 that I want to embark on and what I envision myself doing further in a sort of desirable scenario.\n\nI will concentrate on two events that took place recently, so I don\u2019t take too much of your time. March 2<sup>nd</sup> 2012 signified the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the war in Transnistria. It was a war between the local population, Cossack volunteers and the Russian 14<sup>th</sup> Army on one side trying to maintain the weak independence of this small strip of land (Transnistria). On the other side were the newly formed Moldovan police and volunteers from the other bank of the Nistru river who wanted to reintegrate the former Moldovan Soviet Republic within the internationally recognized borders of the young sovereign Republic of Moldova. Fortunately, even though it was a small-scale war it had tremendous negative consequences for the population on both banks of the Nistru river.\n\nI\u2019ve learned how dangerous and destructive it is to take sides when talking to people that chose to risk their own lives for an ideal/belief. They can neither be lauded/praised, because they chose to spill the blood of others to justify their own ideals. The option of reverting to violence in any type of conflict, to me, is one of the most cowardly, inhuman acts, let alone ethics and morals.\n\nJudging by the outcome of this war after 20 years, it is sad to acknowledge that violence has not resolved anything. In fact I could go as far as saying that it actually never resolved anything anywhere, but made it even worse. It took a long time for people as my uncle who was a combatant in the war to understand that violence is useless and the deaths on both sides were in vain. Still it is sad that the amount of hate speech on both sides is still louder than the voices of peace and secessionism is stronger that any agency for cooperation and dialogue. Unfortunately, there are people in Moldova and Transnistria that are still convinced that violence in 1992 was justified and that they are ready to pick up the arms if the circumstances would necessitate that. Still, if violence is considered the option of \u201clast resort\u201d, then what were the other thousand resorts before opting for mayhem and bloodshed?! Here the Moldovan authorities are even more to blame because they have consciously decided to opt for violent means even though they didn\u2019t have a standing army, resources or preparation. Still, they have cowardly pushed young, poorly armed policemen against the Russian tanks and artillery.\n\nEven though there have not been major outbreaks of violence in these two decades, the confidence of the people towards the other side has not been restored, there hasn\u2019t been an serious commitment towards reconciliation and burden sharing in order to transcend the current state of affairs between the two banks. There was a virtual little to no progress in the negotiations over the years. There are very little accessible routes for communication and interaction, Russian \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d are still monitoring the security zone, old preconceptions and prejudices are not yet dissolved/deconstructed.\n\nWhy am I telling all this? Somehow, the subjects of separatism/secessionism, de facto statehood and international recognition of states, peacebuilding, conflict transformation and international development in fragile states have become main interests in my studies. In the spring of 2010, when I was doing interviews in Transnistria I have discovered that ordinary citizens were not particularly negatively predisposed towards each other. There is no hatred towards the other side, but rather trauma, regret and disappointment in the lost opportunities, incompetent leadership and deepening underdevelopment. So here\u2019s when I realized that what I want to do is help people so that they can help each other to build sustainable peace, collaborative development and constructive relations among humans across the Nistru river. I know, it may sound a somewhat pompous and vague, but if in the last 2 decades there was nothing but cheap talk from the politicians, populist and nationalist attitudes form some public figures which have only escalated the conflict, it is the time to try something else. So, what I want to do next is draw lessons in successful conflict transformation and development projects, policies, strategies from around the world and see how can this body of knowledge be tailored in the Moldovan context and even some place else.\n\nThe other recent event I wanted to talk about is my new status of dual citizenship. Besides my original status of citizen of the Republic of Moldova, I am now a citizen of Romania and therefore of the EU as well. This has raised mixed thoughts in me for several reasons. First of all, there\u2019s some sort of hypocrisy in all this because on one side, I have become a citizen of a state where I have obtained my education (no matter good or bad) and I have been receiving a scholarship and free accommodation in campus from the Romanian government. On the other side, after residing 5 years in Romania I am very critical about many issues in Romania starting from the political situation up to social relations.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve realized was hypocritical of me is the fact that one of the main advantages of my newly acquired citizenship is the ability to travel without a visa across the 27 EU member states and elsewhere and also a larger job pool. At the same time, I am not proud to be a part of a supranational entity that has deep structural flaws, serious democratic deficit and a deplorable foreign policy besides other weaknesses.\n\nMoreover, if I want to be successful in preventing violence and to peacefully transform the conflict in Transnistria I have to be aware how my Romanian citizenship could be interpreted as a loss of impartiality and as favoring on side of the conflict, thus delegitimizing myself in the eyes of others. It is worth noting that one of the major reasons for the secession of Transnistria form Moldova was the fear of its possible reunification with Romania. Even today, after Romania was the first state to officially recognize Moldova\u2019s independence, the fears of Romanian \u2018invasion\u2019 and assimilation in are still vivid today among ethnic Russians and Ukrainians in Transnistria as well as in Moldova. \u00a0\n\nCertainly, the best \u2018ryde\u2019 is yet to come as I will have to reconcile these conflicting views/perspectives and make sense of the environment I will be placed in and of my role/purpose in that environment. Perhaps, I will be able to share a more exciting, optimistic and relevant story in the coming 3-5 years. Thanks for bearing with me.\n\nIn peace,\n\nAndrei\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-07 12:33:03", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 06:17:26.949763", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1198, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 37.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 987, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 954, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\" height=\"300\" width=\"600\">\n\n<embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" flashvars=\"offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fquatrecouleurs%2Fsets%2F72157632198190068%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fquatrecouleurs%2Fsets%2F72157632198190068%2F&amp;set_id=72157632198190068&amp;jump_to=\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=122138\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"600\"></embed></object>\n\n_Photos By Joel Obrecht_\n\n<strong>So what came out of \\#LOTE2?</strong> So much activity, discussions, collaborations, projects kicked off and ideas developed and are still surfacing as I type this post.

Capital where I first had to start learning to pack suitcases to\u00a0go to Pointe-Noire (Republic of the Congo) with my parents and elder sister. I was 4 months old.\u00a0\n\nOne year later we moved to Douala (Cameroon), another French-speaking country, reason why I\u00a0ended up in a French kindergarden and carried on in the French educational system.\n\nWe lived the historical turn of the decade - 1988 to 1991- in Luanda (Angola). While in the Northern\u00a0Hemisphere the Cold War was coming to an end with the fall of the Berlin Wall, we were in an extremely\u00a0resourceful country divided into zones controlled by rival armed political groups supported by superpowers\u00a0such as US and USSR.\n\nThen came Port-Gentil (Gabon), where I remember learning how to fish from the local kids with only\u00a0a fishing line and a hook and going to indigenous markets where everyone called my mother \u201cMaman\u201d.\u00a0\n\nAfter having spent the first 10 years of my life in Africa, we then moved to a tiny peninsula in the\u00a0Middle East named Qatar. Wow! So different from what I had seen until then: no street life, huge houses in\u00a0compounds all looking alike and most impressive... all women covered in black!\n\n(Un)Fortunately it was only until we arrived to Mumbai (India) that I understood what mass poverty\u00a0meant. So many people. A different unrecognizable disease at every traffic light. An improvised \u201chome\u201d at\u00a0every corner. An authentic organized chaos in which the symbiotic relation between diversity and respect\u00a0created an admirable synergy: crossroads with a Temple, a Mosque, a Synagogue and a Church all cohabiting\u00a0in harmony.\n\nBy the age of 14, I had the chance to discover what it felt like to live in an industrialized country as we\u00a0settled in Barcelona (Spain). Suddenly life seemed much easier while I was getting acquainted with the term\u00a0Freedom. Playing outside with friends wasn't a problem anymore and purchasing goods and services was\u00a0always too easy.\n\nFrom then on the rest of my studies and work experience were in Europe: finished high school in\u00a0Paris (France), studied for 1 year at a business university in Lisbon (Portugal), completed my degree in\u00a0Product Design in Barcelona (Spain), worked in a visual management company in San Sebastian (Spain) and\u00a0did a Masters in Design for Social Business in Milan (Italy).\n\nThe reason why I chose to tell you about my journey was also a way for me to understand how\u00a0inherently I perceived design as a tool to solve the REAL problems of our world, helping people generate\u00a0social development through products, services and experiences.\u00a0It is the\u00a0best opportunity I found to achieve self-actualization through an exceptional combination: working in a people-centered orgnaization\u00a0and designing for social welfare.\n\n... And this is who I am and my purpose in life (and this is when I shift to the \"Make a living\" campaign)! ;-)\n\n</div></div>Tiago\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-19 17:04:35", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 14:46:14.094878", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 637, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1303, "user_id": 453, "topic_id": 1270, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I'll start the story of my Ryde by quotting my first <a href=\"http://eric.harris-braun.com\">blog</a> post ever (back in 2005):\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left; margin-left: 40px; \">A few days ago I stopped at a gas station. As I was pumping, I noticed a vole scurrying across the parking lot. The lot was covered with a thin layer of that dry compacted, dirty snow that you get when it's been cold enough that the snow never melted or turned ice. The vole would zip along for about six feet, and then try to burrow under a clump of snow, only to hit pavement so it would zip another few feet and try again. It had come from behind the gas station where there is a field, and it was headed in the direction of a very busy road. This vole was in for trouble and I'd better do something about it. I was half way through pumping so I finished filling my tank and then turned to see what I could do for the creature.</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left; margin-left: 40px; \">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left; margin-left: 40px; \">By the time I'd spotted it again, it was about twenty feet from the road. I headed not towards the vole, but at an angle that would cut it off from the road so I could shoo it back to the field. But it must have know that I was trying to prevent it from moving towards its intended direction because it immediately headed for the road at a modified angle calculated precisely to avoid me.</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left; margin-left: 40px; \">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left; margin-left: 40px; \">Within seconds the vole was in the middle of the road. The first semi missed it by five feet. The next one flattened it.</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left; margin-left: 40px; \">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left; margin-left: 40px; \">I don't know if the vole would have gone on to the road had I not tried to save it, probably it would have. But I do know that if I had stopped pumping gas right when I realized that this vole was in for trouble, that I would have had a much better chance of saving it.</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left; margin-left: 40px; \">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left; margin-left: 40px; \">I hate pumping gas. Every time I do it, I feel like I'm that vole flinging myself and my fellow humans as fast as possible right toward those tractor-trailer truck wheels. The vole's consciousness doesn't even include roads and trucks, but unlike the vole, I know about peak-oil, and global warming. I can see the truck coming. But why didn't I stop pumping for that vole? Why don't I stop pumping for all us? How conscious can I become?</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>I decided to register for Edgeryders after reading this <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/bring-allies/mission_case/fighting-muppetocracy\">post of Vinay's</a>. \u00a0Clearly there's an affinity of sentiment between Vinay's post, and mine from that blog post, but that's not why I signed up. \u00a0Instead it's because I've been struggling with that sentiment for many years, and decided to take the \"Share your Ryde\" mission as an opportunity to continue with that struggle.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>There's something that feels righteous about \"being willing to face the facts,\" about not being in denial about how bad the situation is. \u00a0It feels responsible, and grown-up. \u00a0It feels like honesty, like trying not to be self-delusional, as well as being willing to take a stand. \u00a0All these are attributes I strive for. \u00a0But my struggle, is around being responsible not only to what is now, but also to what can be, to what is possible. \u00a0In his post, Vinya writes: \"If you're not aware of this situation, I guarantee you it's because you're not paying attention, alas.\" \u00a0That's a great rhetorical flourish: \"If you're not X, it's because you're not paying attention.\" Makes me really want to be X because the last thing I want to be blamed of is \"not paying attention.\" \u00a0But in attention lies the rub. \u00a0There are different qualities of attention that yield awareness of facts (how things are), and of possibility (how things might be).</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>There's that saying \"A falling tree makes more noise than a growing forest.\" \u00a0What I'm most keen on doing, is focusing my attention on the space of actual new possibilities, on listening for the quiet growing forests of our time. \u00a0For me the key experience in this regard over the last years has been what feels like \"openings.\" \u00a0Though I cannot deny the importance of \"facing the facts,\" what seems of far greater import is to listen for the possibilities, the search for, and openness to, openings. \u00a0When openings come, they have consequences. \u00a0An open door is an invitation to at least look into the room behind it. So, to share my ryde is to share openings and their consequences. \u00a0The direction of my life has changed drastically since 2003, because of a number of openings and the consequences of them. \u00a0Here are the key ones, not strictly in chronological order, but close:</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Opening \\#1</strong>: In 2003 my father gave me two books to read: Interest &amp; Inflation Free Money, by Margrit Kennedy, and The Future of Money by Bernard Leitaer. \u00a0For me these books were one-way doors. \u00a0Once I'd stepped through, there was no going back, because suddenly I understood three things: 1) money was a human invention 2) this particular invention is foundational to all human social patterns 3) we can change it, and there-by change our social patterns. Thus, I became open to a huge new possibility.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>The consequence</strong> of this opening was two-fold: first, that I became involved in a local currency project (one that never got off the ground), and second that I was invited on the board of the E. F. Schumacher Society, a small non-profit that for decades had quietly been working on many decentralist economic efforts, including local-currency efforts, which has now grown and become the <a href=\"http://neweconomicsinstitute.org\">New Economics Institute</a> .</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>In 2004, the Schumacher Society held what I consider to be a pivotal conference called Local Currencies in the 21st Century. \u00a0Plenary speakers at this conference included both Kennedy and Leitaer (authors of those two books), and also Tom Greco, but most importantly for me, it's where I met Michael Linton, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Noubel, and Arthur Brock.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Opening \\#2</strong>: Michael Linton. \u00a0I knew of Michael before the conference from my reading, as he is a pioneer in the community currency world, well know for his design of <a href=\"http://www.gmlets.u-net.com/\">LETS</a>, one of the most widely deployed community currency patterns. But at the conference Michael was talking about his ideas for <a href=\"http://www.openmoney.org/\">open money</a>. \u00a0I daresay few people at the conference then, or since then, have understood the import of what Michael was sharing. \u00a0He was explaining, as a unified vision, \u00a0the necessary aspects of how the structure of money could to change. Namely that 1) money is information, 2) the pattern of flow of that information in relation to communities should be circular, i.e. issued within the community so it would flow around it, not through it as happens with moneys issued outside of communities. \u00a03) That there must be a rich ecology of currencies appropriate to each communities circumstances. \u00a04) That these currencies must exist in the context of a network that emerges out of an interplay between communities of function (what people do together) and communities of identity (how people see and name themselves). \u00a0Michael was the first person I met who was thinking coherently on this level and actually trying to build a system that addressed these issues and was designed to scale. \u00a0Over the next few years I came to work closely with Michael on the open money project.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Opening \\#3</strong>: Michael introduced me to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(cybernetics)\">Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety</a>, and to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed's_law\">Reed's Law </a>of Group forming Networks. \u00a0These two \"Laws\" are both fascinating and deep, and they clearly apply to money and currency systems. \u00a0Single national currencies fail to provide the systemic regulatory variety necessary for a healthy economy. \u00a0Also, a multi-currency network would be an incredible group-forming network. \u00a0But the real opening for me was not so much in the laws themselves, but in that they both point to the fact that in networked and cybernetic systems, new ways of thinking are necessary, and the results are surprising and non-intuitive. \u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Opening \\#4</strong>: <a href=\"http://noubel.com/\">Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Noubel</a>. At the Local Currencies conference Jean-Fran\u00e7ois was sharing his work on <a href=\"http://www.thetransitioner.org/Collective_Intelligence_Invisible_Revolution_JFNoubel.pdf\">Collective Intelligence</a>. \u00a0This work identifies and describes the evolution of the forms of collective intelligence from \"original collective intelligence\" through where we are now, which he calls \"pyramidal collective intelligence,\" on to the possibility of \"global collective intelligence.\" In his work, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois also focuses on \"invisible architectures,\" those patterns that, mostly unconsciously, regulate our lives. \u00a0One of the most crucial that he identifies, of course, is the monetary system. \u00a0Looking at the world through the this opening, the lens of collective intelligence and invisible architectures, gave me, and continues to give me, not only a powerful explanatory rubric for how things are now, but also where they might go.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Consequences, phase I:</strong> \u00a0I'm trained as coder (I have a B.S in computer science), but just before my father gave me the books that constitute opening \\#1, I had decided to give up coding. \u00a0Over the years I had written a bunch of a good code that had made a bunch customers happy, but I didn't feel like it was right. \u00a0I wanted to be focusing on something that had a deeper impact. \u00a0So I gave it up, and told my partner that I wanted out of our small dev shop. \u00a0Well, after openings 1-4, I found myself right back in coding land. \u00a0I knew that now I had the opportunity to try and implement software systems that could realize the promise of a new monetary system. \u00a0This felt like impact. \u00a0So this led to working closely with Michael to build <a href=\"https://github.com/zippy/open-money-yawaf\">a web-app</a>\u00a0that was pretty much to his open money specifications, and was meant to be a single server fully functional prototype to demonstrate what a networked multi-currency system would look like. \u00a0That system is still operational and used in a couple of places. \u00a0You can check the <a href=\"http://dev.openmoney.info\">dev site</a>.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Opening \\#5</strong>: The levels of Wealth and their relation to systems. This opening was sparked by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Noubel, who described to me a taxonomy of wealth. \u00a0He had realized that money is a tool that focuses on building tradable wealth, but that tradable wealth is just a small subset of measurable wealth, which itself is a subset of acknowledgeable wealth. \u00a0What I realized, is that those levels exist because of systemic truths, i.e. that each level of wealth corresponds to levels of systemic integrity. \u00a0That tradable wealth corresponds with parts and products of systems, and measurable wealth corresponds with properties of systems as a whole, and acknowledgeable wealth corresponds with relationships between systems. Here is where I first wrote about all this: <a href=\"http://openmoney.info/sophia\">http://openmoney.info/sophia/.</a>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Opening \\#6</strong>: <a href=\"http://artbrock.com/\">Arthur Brock</a>, flow and current-see. \u00a0The opening about the levels of wealth came pretty much at the same time as I was also deepening my association with Arthur Brock who I had first met at the Local Currency conference. \u00a0When I met him at the conference he was championing what he called \"targeted currencies,\" special purpose currencies for solving particular community problems, rather than general purpose exchange currencies. \u00a0Arthur had been using the metaphor a the electromagnetic spectrum, comparing monetary currencies to visible light, when there was actually much larger range of currency \"frequencies\" that were available to solve other problems. \u00a0But it wasn't until I came to understand Art's deeper definition of currency, as \"current-see\" or formal information systems that allows us to see and interact with currents, flows, that the things really came together. \u00a0These different levels of wealth, corresponding to the levels of systemic integrity, also needed corresponding currency types, to manage the different types of flow that are taking place at those different systemic levels.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Consequences, phase II</strong>: Openings \\#5 &amp; 6 showed that my first open money system wasn't enough, that as well as being able to create new currencies in the network environment, that it would be necessary create multiple types of currency that operated very differently depending on which level of wealth they were targeting. \u00a0I wanted to build a generalized \"wealth acknowledgement\" system. \u00a0And I also wanted to try my hand at building a system that would be client-server based that would allow multiple servers to play and thus be decentralized. \u00a0At the time I met Geoff Chesshire who had also been working with Michael Linton and was building a currency system called <a href=\"http://partysmart.org/vcsh/index.php\">Regenerosity</a>, which used the idea of laying down what amounted to a social network graph to record the changing relationships in a community, which is essentially what monetary transaction are. \u00a0Using these ideas I built a whole new system. \u00a0Here's an overview of the technical architecture (what I called the Mesh &amp; Churn): <a href=\"http://openmoney.info/techne/overview.html\">http://openmoney.info/techne/overview.html</a>, and the code I wrote to implement it is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/openmoney\">https://github.com/openmoney</a>. \u00a0A demo site is still up at: <a href=\"http://omclient.heroku.com/\">http://omclient.heroku.com/</a>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>The new system was working, and it was pretty easy to create mutual credit currencies, as well as reputation currencies, and if you were a geek you could configure other types of currencies too. \u00a0But there was a big problem. \u00a0Though I had made allowance for these different types of currencies, technically most of my focus was on laying down that social graph, the mesh. \u00a0I hadn't yet paid lots of attention to what the range structure of different possible currencies could be, and how I was going to integrate that.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Opening \\#7</strong>: David Abram's \"Spell of the Sensuous.\" \u00a0Abram's book provides an amazing account of how we've shifted the locus of meaning from the natural sensual world to human constructed one in the form of our abstract alphabet. \u00a0The opening came while reading his account of the evolution of writing. \u00a0That description opened my eyes not only to how currency is very much like writing, but that it's also on a similar evolutionary track, going from a very concrete representation form, \"pictograms\", to a much more abstract one, an \"alphabet.\" \u00a0We think of modern money as very abstract, most often just bits a banks computer. \u00a0But what I realized, is that money is still very concrete, and just like pictographic writing. It's not abstract at all because all moneys so far use the same encoding mechanism they always have for value: relative scarcity (just like all pictograms use the same encoding mechanism for meaning: shape) \u00a0And that encoding mechanism is only really appropriate for tradable wealth where scarcity is a true for parts and products of systems. \u00a0It's not appropriate for the wider levels of wealth. \u00a0What I saw is that we have no \"alphabet\" for encoding all the levels of value, and that's what the open money system I'd been working on could evolve into. \u00a0I've written a couple blog posts about this if you want to read about it in more depth: \u00a0<a href=\"http://eric.harris-braun.com/blog/2007/11/05/id-55\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://metacurrency.org/blog/2010/10/22/money-information-wealth-literacy\">here</a>.\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Consequences, phase III</strong>: The rise of the MetaCurrency project, XGFL &amp; the Flowplace. \u00a0By this time, it was clear that I was interested in more than \"money\" because monetary currencies are those that apply to the smallest circle of wealth, tradable wealth. \u00a0I was committed to working on what I was calling a \"meta-currency\" system that had a currency specification language that would be capable of representing wealth at all levels. \u00a0So Art &amp; I founded the <a href=\"http://metacurrency.org/\">MetaCurrency</a> project to be a home for the tech protocols and know-how that would make this happen. Focusing on this problem from the currency-specification language point of view resulted in a <a href=\"http://metacurrency.org/sites/metacurrency.org/files/docs/Design_for_a_Meta_Currency_Platform.pdf\">design document</a> that included the Simple Game Format Language (SGFL) which later became XGFL (X for eXtensible). \u00a0This language was to be for currencies, as HTML was for web resources. \u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>At the same time I started working with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois and Fernanda Ibarra who together wanted to a usable platform for groups of early adopters they were working with in<a href=\"http://thetransitioner.org/\"> the transitioner network</a> who wanted to start living these ideas of multi-level-wealth currencies. \u00a0So together we built the <a href=\"https://github.com/zippy/flowplace\">Flowplace</a>. \u00a0Here's the\u00a0<a href=\"http://demo.flowplace.org\">demo site</a>. The Flowplace implements the XGFL language, and at the same time includes a bunch of other important ideas necessary for actually organizing communities (what we called circles) around them and making them useful, the equivalent of a marketplace in the multi-level-currency context. \u00a0Jean-Fran\u00e7ois and Fernanda have used the Flowplace in a number of contexts and people have had transformative experiences as it can give a taste of a what a multi-level-currency world might look like. \u00a0But from my perspective, as a system designer, this experiment, like my previous one, was a dead end. \u00a0Where the Mesh &amp; Churn didn't have a native way to include currency specification, the Flowplace with XGFL, didn't have a native way to relate currencies to each-other. \u00a0We did do some important work on what we called <a href=\"http://blog.newcurrencyfrontiers.com/2009/10/membrane-currencies.html\">membrane currencies</a> to address this difficiency, but it just didn't feel right, and I knew it didn't have legs.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Opening \\#8</strong>: The evolution of expressive capacity. \u00a0Unlike all the other openings I've listed, for this one I can't pinpoint its source. \u00a0Of course it builds on all the other openings, but there's not a particular person, conversation or writing or even moment that I can remember where it arrived. \u00a0I think its the product of all of us working together around the MetaCurrency project. \u00a0I now see that all the previous openings were partial views of this bigger pattern. \u00a0So, yes, money is information, and yes, its evolution is like that of writing, but here's the deeper pattern: It appears that the greatest leaps in \"novelty,\" i.e. increased possibility that we know of, all arise because of the emergence of new embodied information encoding systems, what I like to call \"expressive capacities\". \u00a0DNA, neurons, language, writing, the printing press, computers, these are all examples, at various levels of complexity, of such expressive capacities that allow for a explosion of possibility that is unimaginable before their arrival. \u00a0Notice that though they are all \"revolutionary\" some of these new expressive capacities are more revolutionary than others. \u00a0The invention of writing and the printing press are extensions of the basic expressive capacity of language. \u00a0But the arrival of language and DNA are much more, shall we say, foundational.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>So here's the crux of the opening: I see that we are at nexus point where new expressive capacity is ready to emerge that's on the same \"foundational\" level as language and DNA. \u00a0Our current day money is to that new expressive capacity as the coordinating hunting grunts of some proto-hominids is to language. \u00a0Just as those grunts were somehow synthesized into a small collection of phonemes out of which an infinite number of words could be built, and which themselves are connected and organized into the subject-predicate grammar of human language, so is there the possibility for us to evolve away from that form of grunting we call money. \u00a0What we can it evolve toward, is, for the lack of a better term, a language of flow. \u00a0What this language expresses as an embodied information encoding system, is the equivalent of DNA, but for social, rather than biological organism.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Consequences, phase IV:</strong> \u00a0After this opening became clear, it was pretty obvious what the problem was with XGFL. \u00a0It's at the wrong expressive level. \u00a0Expressive capacities are all built out of fairly simple nested composable units. \u00a0Narratives are built from paragraphs, which are built from sentences, which are built from phrases, which are built from words, which are built from word parts, which are built from phonemes, which are built from phones. \u00a0The rules for composability at each level are fairly simple, yet the variety of that which is expressible is infinite because of the combinatorial explosion. \u00a0This same property works for all other expressive capacities, think of DNA and neurons, a small vocabulary of composable parts, mixable with definite meaningful grammatics. \u00a0You see the pattern. \u00a0Starting with XGFL to define currencies was like starting with a whole paragraph as the basic unit for a language. \u00a0It was an expressive capacity without the necessary simple levels of composability. \u00a0Here's a <a href=\"http://http://metacurrency.org/blog/2010/10/22/composable-abstractions-for-wealth-building\">blog post where I wrote about this</a>. \u00a0That post includes a diagram of a new architecture that we worked on for quite a while, but again, it didn't quite feel right, until...</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Opening \\#9:</strong> The Receptive Stance. \u00a0In November of 2010, I flew to Denver for a working retreat with Art. \u00a0The opening came early on in our working sessions. \u00a0I have photo of the flip chart with the exact quote we wrote down when it came: \"Composition requires creation of a negative space, i.e. receptors for an as of yet unknown interaction.\" \u00a0For so long we had been searching for some currency ontology, i.e. we were trying to figure out what the basic currency components were out of which we could build our flow language. \u00a0This opening had us flip our attention, i.e. not to look for the parts, but to look at the negative space, the structure of containment that could allow for the rise of as of yet unknown parts.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<strong>Consequences, phase V:</strong> From this opening a whole slew of other things have emerged (and are still emerging). \u00a0These consequences haven't played out yet, so I'll just say that it's led to what we are calling the ceptr platform, as well as a <a href=\"http://prezi.com/vcfwa-8ocg7m/metacurrency-strategy-vision/\">strategic plan for rolling it out</a>, which includes a very cool app call Streamscapes. \u00a0Prototyping for both of these is at: <a href=\"https://github.com/zippy/anansi\">https://github.com/zippy/anansi</a>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>To close, a short story: I live in an intentional community. One of the things we've been doing here is lots of planting. \u00a0For me, this meant that besides starting a terracing system to create a kitchen garden this year, I also planted four fruit trees: a cherry, two peaches and an apple. \u00a0I decided to buy fairly large trees (not the less expensive bare root trees you can get) but ones that were already a good six foot tall with a root-ball, to get a head start. \u00a0It felt like a good investment. \u00a0Well, not more than a month after planting, the apple tree started leaning over in the wind. \u00a0So I added some stakes and support to help stabilize it. \u00a0A month later I found the tree almost lying flat. \u00a0Examining it, closely I found that it was no longer a tree with roots, but rather more like a stake with branches jammed into the ground. \u00a0Some critters had totally separated the growing trunk from all the roots. \u00a0Turns out it was voles. \u00a0Nearby the trees I had dumped a large pile of manure which was planning to spread in the spring. \u00a0The warmth of pile is now host to a prolific family of voles, that apparently also took advantage of the soft earth that resulted from my digging a nice hole to plant the apple tree, and enjoyed the roots and bark of the tree in the mean time.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>So here are the voles again, intersecting with my life. \u00a0But this time, oddly, something I did was giving them life, and to my expense! There is the economic farmer in me who's frustrated and angry. \u00a0Frustrated at the loss of a $50 tree, and wanting to just go get rid of those voles. \u00a0But there's someone else in me who's laughing. \u00a0I can't quite name that person, but I feel like he/she's laughing at a joke that's on me, and it's actually a good-humored joke. \u00a0It feels like maybe that vole-chewed tree is part of a bigger pattern that I can't quite see, but that person inside me can see it, and is chuckling at my farmer response to the vole. \u00a0What is that pattern? \u00a0I don't know for sure. \u00a0But what I am sure of, is that though I have to be responsible to facts of the current reality, at this stage, it's essential that pay very close attention for openings through which I may be able to become responsible to emergent possibilities.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-03 16:36:11", "updated_at": "2017-08-25 16:33:55.666439", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4737, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 100.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23246, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1567, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Focus on connections in BC</b>\n\nI also met Chris Vein in Edmonton (Alberta, Canada) in October 2010.\n\nThe model of international multllateral partnership proposed by Government and the Lab (designed by JohnFMoore and I), was based on a combination of top-down / bottom-up collaboration, involving as its core, developing countries, and starting with an experimental project where a small group of States would participe (4).

I grew up here, took my degree in Political science here and started my professional career.\u00a0\n\nI have always combined a love for <strong>journalism </strong>and <strong>communication</strong> with a strong interest in <strong>youth policies and education</strong>.\u00a0 So after my degree I started to work for a little agency which is involved in lifelong learning projects as well as writing \u00a0for an important local economic magazine as an expert in this field. I was happy thinking about my bright future, thinking that I was only at the beginning\u2026\n\nWhile all my best friends started to leave Naples, looking for a decent job and a different lifestyle, I believed that if we want to change something we have to start from our own environment even if the challenge is very hard to achieve. \u00a0So I proceeded with my plans, taking an interesting \u00a0job at the main Italian public administration agency and I believed that I was moving in the right direction to reach my personal and professional goals. But suddenly this project stopped. <strong>\u00a0I didn\u2019t know what to do next </strong>and so I started to send hundreds of applications forms often without any answer.\n\nThen this was my significant turning point, I lived this moment with a lot of doubts, fears and insecurities. My feelings were like as I was losing my professional identity.\n\nDuring the bad times I \u00a0have often thought about leaving Naples like my friends and joining them somewhere in Europe, because my confidence in changing things in my local area was going down and down\u2026so for this reason I started to look for something to do abroad.\n\nI forced myself \u00a0to find a way that could lead me into a<strong> new and motivating professional field</strong> and looking at my skills I found it in my first love, journalism. But I\u00a0 quickly understood that this field was not simple and above all not well paid especially in Italy! I spent a lot of time surfing on the internet using all my sources and looking for some opportunities. Finally I discovered an international group of students in journalism, <a href=\"http://www.fejs.it/sito/\">FEJS</a>, that organized every year in a different country \u00a0their assembly and I decided to apply for the next event in Zagreb, Croatia.\u00a0\n\n<strong>This was a special experience</strong> that gave me a renewed <strong>self-confidence.</strong> I realized that I was able to do my job also in a foreign language, that I had the good skills to work in international group. \u00a0There I won the first prize for the best article, about unemployed young people and all their problems, \u00a0and above all I met a very interesting network of people and experts in investigative journalism.\n\nMeanwhile, when I came back to Italy I was employed as an expert in Policy Mainstreaming and a scouting consultant for an innovative local Public Administration project about educational best practice in the Campania Region, called \u201cScuole Aperte\u201d, that I had applied for before my Croatian experience. This gave me the confidence that I could continue to work on the projects that I have always believed important and that I could really make change in my local area.\n\nStarting from this moment <strong>I strengthen my personality and my professional profile</strong>, because even though I was very happy to be part of this innovative project that was involved with education in my region of origin, I \u00a0nonetheless, after my experience of the lack of opportunities, decided to continue <strong>my investment in \u201cmobility\u201d</strong> and my curiosity about how to <strong>develop my skills in an international framework</strong>. For this reason \u00a0I\u00a0 have in the last few years had the opportunity to participate in \u00a0and meet many <strong>youth networks </strong>that have developed suitable and creative initiatives in different fields. During this time I have been creating a <strong>strong and pioneering personal network</strong>. \u00a0And this is my big satisfaction, because I feel connect at a great youth networks that can offer me a chance to make real connections, and gain insights from people I\u2019d never have a chance to interact with.\n\nThis wonderful experience with my local environment, Scuole Aperte,\u00a0 is \u00a0now finished, and \u00a0we are in the middle of the economic crisis and it is not easy to find a paid job. So as you can see I consider my \u201ctransition\u201d still in progress. <strong>Every project for me has been a new challenge</strong>, as it is for many young people. I believe that the key to achieving a good transition is not to give up, but to continue to stay true to your objectives. I have always believed in <strong>the power of the network</strong> and in the sharing of experiences in informal contexts. This has helped me to stay in touch with different groups of young people and be inspired by their activities. Using new technologies and a big dose of positivism, <strong>I have continued to work and to initiate new collaborations</strong>, such as with the <a href=\"http://www.cafebabel.it/\">Cafebabel </a>community, Indigo magazine, <a href=\"http://ww.youthpress.org/\">European Youth Press</a> and Youth Press Italy, <a href=\"http://www.ejc.net/\">EJC</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.youthforum.org/\">European Youth Foru</a>m with which I\u2019ve been collaborating as a correspondent for YO magazine since 2009. Thanks to EYF I have had the opportunity to report, analyze and deepen my experience, from different perspectives, about European youth, about the problems restricting them and their splendid spirit of initiative.\n\nThanks to the value of my international experiences I also learn that I\u2019m would continue working as consultant in policy mainstreaming using my skills in journalism, new media and relationship.\n\nI grew up isolated, but my present and my future is connected. I grew up unable to have substantial interactions with anyone except a small circle of family and co-workers but now, I earn the right to interact with just about anyone.

Edgeryders ha gi\u00e0 un <a href=\"/t/about-the-culture-squad-group/613\">Culture Squad</a>. Nasce dal fatto che alcune persone attive nella comunit\u00e0 erano interessate a lavorare su arte e cultura. Abbiamo avviato con loro alcune iniziative, e speriamo di montare una business unit vera e propria nel corso del 2017. Siamo abbastanza ottimisti che qualche cliente si trover\u00e0.\n\nUna Care Squad \u00e8, in teoria, possibile. Cosa hai in mente? Sei disposto a lavorarci tu (questo fa un sacco di differenza, perch\u00e9 i fondatori di Edgeryders sono tutti gi\u00e0 molto presi, e per allargare il ventaglio delle cose che facciamo abbiamo bisogno di forze fresche)?\n\nC'\u00e8 \u00a0anche una piccola cosa che abbiamo gi\u00e0: <a href=\"/t/smart-swarms-vs-big-funding-how-to-build-a-100-million-dollars-project-as-a-swarm-of-grassroots-organizations/5773\">Open&amp;Change</a>. A oggi, questa \u00e8 una alleanza di 23 iniziative \"dal basso\" tirate su da opencare (una per esempio \u00e8 quella di @Rune , che conosci). Come prima cosa abbiamo fatto un'application a un grosso grant della Fondazione Mac Arthur; proprio questa settimana ci hanno detto che abbiamo passato la prima fase eliminatoria. Vedremo poi dove portarla.\u00a0\n\nDi fatto, tu stesso potresti \"essere Edgeryders\" nella misura in cui vuoi fare qualcosa e riesci a trovare un cliente o un finanziatore. Con il nostro aiuto, per qanto possibile: noi in questo cerchiamo sempre di sostenere i membri della comunit\u00e0. Edgeryders va dove la comunit\u00e0 la porta.\u00a0\n\nTi suggerirei di cercare di essere il pi\u00f9 concreto possibile. Certo, possiamo fare networking transnazionale (noi siamo\u00a0<em>molto</em>\u00a0transnazionali), ma quella io la vedo come un'attivit\u00e0 di contorno. La pietanza principale deve essere qualcosa di concreto: ricerca, sviluppo, lancio di uno spinoff che fa community-based care...\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-08 19:12:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:08.589704", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 337, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20288], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1596, "user_id": 17, "topic_id": 1563, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<div>There are lots of reasons to support Vinay Gupta's thesis that <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/practical-resilience/mission_case/europe-risk-war-what-should-we-do\">Europe is on the brink of a kind of war</a>. His thesis is that at some stage the austerity measures being imposed for ideological reasons on Greece (and other countries in Europe - Spain, Portugal, Italy and Ireland) will result in some kind of revolutionary backlash where property will be seized. The fact that much of this property is owned by international institutions will result in major crises and consequent disruption of food supply chains and other infrastructure.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>There are several responses to this:</div>\n\n<div>1. It is already happening. Fundamentally the austerity measures are resulting in property seizure by international agencies (banks, TNCs) of personal or national assets (cf. for example the privatisation programme imposed on Greece). The privatisation of the NHS in the UK is another front where this war is occurring in the UK - what this means is that gradually that hip-replacement Vinay mentions no longer becomes an automatic right but is initially rationed and then eventually needs to be paid for. The absence of funds is making living in remote Greek islands extremely precarious if you happen to have an accident or life threatening illness. This process of conquest and colonisation by (relatively) faceless forces is no different than the earlier incarnations of colonialism whether we look at the spread of the East India Company or the colonisation of Egypt by the UK in the second half of the 19th century. The major difference today is the rather impressive propaganda whereby people are given the impression that \"there is no alternative\" (TINA). There always are alternatives at every stage in the unfolding of a war. The leader of Greece's SARIZA party, Tsipras, understands this when he says the conflict is between capital and people, and in the same breath states that it is not inevitable that Greece either imposes an austerity package or is kicked out of the Eurozone. His statements show far greater sophistication and understanding of reality than the current statements emanating from Angela Merkel.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>2. It may not happen. One of the interesting but little understood achievements of the European Union is the gradual and subtle interweaving of Europeans at multiple levels. Over 1m UK citizens live (mostly in retirement in Spain). The mayor of Majorca is (or was until recently) a German citizen. Hundreds of thousands of EU citizens work in other EU countries. Universities and companies around the EU employ a multiplicity of international staff especially from other EU regions. There are 300,000 French citizens living in London, but there are an equal number of Greeks living there (proportionately a far greater percentage), let alone Spanish, Portugese and Irish. One question today is what the proportions are of the various social groups who are other Europeans. In the 19th century, a large proportion of 'navies' (those who dug the canals and built the railways) were Irish, but few bankers in the City of London were Irish. Today the proportion of foreign staff at all levels in society has increased enormously.\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>A friend of mine is a Portugese computer scientist working for a top insurance company in Zurich. His girlfriend is French-speaking Swiss. They speak English together. This is typical scenario today, more unusual in earlier centuries where freedom of movement of labour did not exist to that extent either for legal reasons or for lack of education and opportunity.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>So the question arises whether the level of integration I am pointing to here can act as a brake on the tendency towards war. It certainly makes nonsense of national parties, national separatism.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>On the other hand, one of the reasons the Greeks are torn about the Euro in spite of the austerity is the fear of losing the free movement of labour that membership of the EC provided. This fear at present is unfounded as there are other non-Eurozone members of the EC - however, in the long term it may make sense. My mother (aged 74) recommends that people should live where they have a passport because she has seen enough to know the dangers of living somewhere where one is by any criterion 'foreign'.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>3. It does not need to happen. Vinay has argued time and again that the final arbiter of power is the nation state, with its laws and military power. If Tsipras is right that the real war is between capital and the people, and Vinay is right that the power lies with the nation state, then if Greece were to revolt and the nation state's power go into the hands of a revolutionary force then what part could capital play here? Three things to remember: First, nations have renationalised their resources frequently and often without serious negative consequences to their economic position (cf. Argentina renationalising its oil company, or Bolivia's Morales nationalising the natural gas reserves). Capital screams, everyone is upset, and then they move on. These are the rules of the game and if a nation choses to change them they usually have the right to do so if they are in a strong enough position.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>Second, as Tsipras says, the problem lies as much with the lenders as with the borrowers. Greece is in a much stronger position than public discourse allows. It has already defaulted in effect so the imposition of the austerity is an ideological imposition independant of the reality of financial default.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>Third, there is an irony that over the years Greece has been one of the largest arms importers in the world, spending more as a proportion of GDP than any other EU country. There is no present day need for this except to keep French, German and UK arms manufacturers happy. The side effect of this is that if Greece does choose to follow an independant path it is in a better position to do so than almost any other mediterranean country.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>But this is not the sort of war Vinay speaks about - he speaks of an undeclared war of infrastructure meltdown. Nonetheless the point here is that power is not all in the hands of the EC or the neo-colonialist/neo-liberals.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>4. Vinay's focus on the cities is important. Countries like Greece have kept strong ties to the countryside. Most Greek families have a 'second home' in the village, and it is to this village that many are returning. Ties have been kept with the relatives in the village supplying olive oil, and other basics. There are enormous problems with regard to the ability of Greek villages to feed themselves, but there is also huge potential. The poorer people are in the mediterranean societies the less impacted they are by the austerity measures, they more 'off-grid' they are in practice. It would interesting to find out whether just as the European banks have disengaged over the past 2-3 years from financially dangerous investments in the EC periphery, whether there has been a corresponding disengagement at an infrastructure level of the local populations, a re-engagment with the family ties which have always acted as the final, most essential infrastructure in times of crisis. If you can flee the city and be received by your cousins in the country, then the situation is a lot less bad than if you are an alienated individual with no effective ties to a (first life) social network.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>This leads to the natural question as to what role can technology, especially social networks and our networked world, play in reducing the alienation of cities and providing alternative succour as the hard infrastructure collapses. Will our Facebook friends receive us, house us, feed us, when the shit hits the fan? Will we be able to find them in first life if all we know is their second life handle, when the lights go down?</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>5. While there has been an immense growth of international organisation in many areas (NGOs e.g. Greenpeace, TNCs e.g. Vodaphone, GM, Tata), there has been a dearth of overtly international political movements since the collapse of communism. In the context of Tsipras' remarks, we need transnational, pan-european political and social movements. We have the structural underpinnings - in the form of a common language (English dominates the EC) and technologies (social media, etc.). We have the political context in that it has become more and more clear that decisions are no longer made by our national governments for a whole range of issues. We have a clear democratic deficit (the weakness of the European parliament is well known). All this augurs well for a revolution in political action which crosses international boundaries and co-ordinates its activities. There are three movements which have to varying degrees expressed this: the Greens and more recently the Pirate Party and the Occupy Movement. Thus while the time may be ripe for revolutions, wars and other such unpleasantnesses, it may also be a opportunity for political maturity across the board, across social classes and national divides. This may sound somewhat utopian but looking at the realities of today in Europe we could just as easily tip into war (real hard war) as we could into creating trans-national political organisation with specific demands and legislative agendas. Here I suspect we come up against a certain degree of defeatism about the possibility of such political movements. The EC is continuously in danger of tipping into oligarchy (of some form). There is an opportunity to push back and revitalise democracy across the board.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>6. The core advice Vinay has given on numerous occasions remains valid: Stock up with food and water so as to be able to survive a lengthy breakdown in services. We can add to that a. ensure you are living in a country whose passport you possess; b. build your first life social network to maximum, c. revitalise the connections with the cousins who grow tomatoes.</div>", "created_at": "2012-06-04 14:40:26", "updated_at": "2017-09-01 07:31:40.647661", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1745, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23396, "user_id": 147, "topic_id": 1117, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>I applied.</b>\n\nThings have come up recently and I'm not sure if there is space and time for New York, but on Aurthur's invitation I have applied.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-03 13:47:56", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.936434", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 36, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [105], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8619, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1009, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I like the first option best, the Pac-Man.

Citizens\u2019 needs are changing faster and to a wider extent than the capacity of City\u2019s Administrations to understand them, not mentioning to tackle them. Cities' Administrations today can opt for a different approach creating a frame able to mobilize the \u201cmost and diverse energies\u201d of the cities. This frame would allow hearing and learning from citizens, social innovators, companies, non-profit and grant making foundations.

On the other hand, it engages directly with the Community. Doing so, the City of Milan has implicitly accepted the rules of the Community, repositioning as a single \"knot in the network,\" leaving aside its institutional central position.\n\n</span>\n\n<span>This reporting would enlighten both layers of the Open Care experience, the vast mobilization and participation to collective intelligences and the co-design experiences in the local communities.

Maybe a team of several leaders could succeed. Andrea Di Maio spoke a few months ago about the \u201c<em>frustration of a leader of open government.</em>\u201d He explained that despite the fact that many opengov projects have been completed to date, these projects have only scratched the surface. <strong>They failed to transform the government.</strong> \"<em>This does not translate into the changing the way government conducts business</em>\", said Di Maio.

Change or die... <span><span>These perspectives do not please me at all. </span></span><span><span>Have we</span> <span>hit the bottom yet?</span> <span>If not,</span> <span>how long</span> <span>until we get to the bottom?</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>What</span> <span>extraordinary impulse</span> <span>will</span> <span>it take </span><span>to go back</span> <span>to the surface</span><span>? </span></span><span><span>I'm afraid of Di Maio's statement, but I must admit that</span> it <span>makes sense</span><span>...</span></span>\n\nOne could compare his statement to a morbidly obese person, whose health is seriously threatened, that must give up his/her bad habits to embrace a healthier way of life. Given the monumental effort and an unwavering commitment to be deployed in such a case, there is reason to wonder what kind of government leadership and teams will be required to initiate and carry out such a change.\n\nTherefore, I agree with what you proposed, and see leadership not as root cause for change, but as the solution to achieve it.\n\n******************************************************************************\n\nMichel,\n\nJe ne pense pas que davantage de gouvernement ouvert \u00abtuera des emplois\u00bb.\n\nLes estimations de d\u00e9veloppement des affaires en lien avec les donn\u00e9es ouvertes sont optimistes pour le secteur priv\u00e9.\n\nDans une allocution portant sur les donn\u00e9es ouvertes (<a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_48_11.htm\">http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_48_11.htm</a>), le chancellor George Osborne du Royaume-Uni a indiqu\u00e9: \"<em>This approach \u2013 using large datasets to search for possible correlations and causations \u2013 shows the massive potential for open data to transform scientific research. The economic impact of this open data revolution will be similarly profound.\u00a0 The annual global market for financial services data analytics is estimated to be worth over $20 billion.\u00a0 According to a new McKinsey report, the market for health analytics could be even larger \u2013 as much as $300 billion a year in the United States alone</em>.\" \u00a0\n\nQuant aux gouvernements eux-m\u00eames, avec les perspectives de gouvernement ouvert, ils font face \u00e0 des transformations consid\u00e9rables qui redessineront leurs fa\u00e7ons de faire et leurs outils de travail, et qui exigeront le d\u00e9veloppement de nouvelles comp\u00e9tences chez les employ\u00e9s gouvernementaux.\n\nMes plus grandes craintes concernent les d\u00e9cideurs et employ\u00e9s bloqu\u00e9s dans la peur du changement.

Can we look for other part?</b>\n\nGreat comment, by the way!\n\nThere is no doubt that there is a cultural evolution.\n\nHomo sapiens... Evolution... we are talking about cultural evolution, but let us also consider the biological aspect of evolution. Let us try to consider this possibility also.\n\nThis is very edgy stuff... I am having difficulties to explain it because my name is not Einstein. It is very complicated, it requires to research on several levels at once. But the more I research, read and think about it, the more I find evidence.\n\nFor now, all I can say is that we have only part of an answer, part of a scientific evidence. So far, scientists has been able to prove the effect of trauma and stress on the body. But no work has been conducted to prove the opposite effect. This could be explained by the rise of cases of stress on the job, burnouts, depression, mental disorders, dementia and cases of suicide. We have been hearing about an increase of cases for many years. WHAT IS NEW HERE, is the 'sweetness' factor, that is so well described in the video that you posted here. What if some individuals felt so much sweetness that it turned into, instead of burnouts and depressions, it turned into bliss? Could this be possible?\n\nI assume -- it is an hypothesis based on logic, ok?\u00a0 -- that if we have accumulated scientific evidence for an effect on the body when there is a negative event or emotions, we could then make the assumption that there is an effect on the biological body when the event or emotions are positive. If stress modifies the structure of the body, we can make the hypothesis that extreme levels of happiness, or well-being, or name it the way you prefer, also modifies the structure of the body.\n\nI found this information today:\n\n\"Ronald Duman of Yale University, a leading expert on the neurology of depression, is one of several scientists who have made some startling discoveries in recent years about the effect that stress has on the brain. The first was made in the late 1990s when researchers from Washington University in St Louis studied the brain anatomy of 10 women who had suffered several bouts of major depression. They discovered that in the depressed women, stress had caused a reduction in size of up to 15 per cent in a brain region known as the hippocampus. Other studies revealed similar shrinkage in the prefrontal cortex, the brain area responsible for thought patterns. This blew apart the leading theory of depression that, for 40 years, had described the condition as simply being caused by low levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin. \u201cThis new research showed that stress not only causes neurochemical changes but structural changes too,\u201d says Duman.\" (ref <a href=\"http://sciencefocus.com/feature/health/deadly-rise-depression\">http://sciencefocus.com/feature/health/deadly-rise-depression</a>)\n\nThese findings encourages me to continue to dig and look for scientific evidence that will demonstrate that we are on the verge of not being not just the normal Homo sapiens that we all think that we are now. There may be more to us than the normal state. If we keep at it with the internet and the social media connections, we could be surprized of the results. The 'sweetness' that the smartphones give may not be just an 'addiction'.\n\nThis week, I noticed on Edgeryders that there has been curiosity around <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/quest-paid-work/mission_case/making-living-edge-elf-pavlik\">Elk Pavlik' story by Cataspanglish</a>. Have you read about his story? Fascinating... A man has been living for 3 years without any money. One could perhaps say that this is an extreme behavior. Does this experience say something about our future?\n\nIn the case of concern here, the effect of connections on your 'mental condition', are there individuals that could be considered like Pavlik?\n\nTo look for evidence of a biological evolution, provoqued presumably by the massive use of internet that large proportions of the populations have been doing these past years, could one try to identify which individuals are having extreme experiences of 'sweetness' or altered 'mental condition' --- in a similar manner as Elk Pavlik ---, and observe these cases, and try to learn something from them?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-06 19:22:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:11.216690", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 766, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13611, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2835, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Im in</b>\n\nThis is a solid as far as Im concerned.

What drew my attention to the tool was the way it can be used to build a network visualization that doesn't rely or retrieve data entirely on/from one community network graph, but includes outward connections of that community eg projects that may not happen on the same platform. So I spotted it as a potentially useful tool for community builders first and foremost - meaning translating my own mental visualization and invisible knowledge into a useful resource for newcomers, not pretending a lot of people would use it and develop it further.\n\nI see you yourself have done some work mapping Edgeryders- \u00a0upon using the Topic search I came across this LOTE3 map, so thanks :)\n\nhttp://metamaps.cc/maps/375\n\nNow, my only doubts - take it as a very early feedback - are in terms of:\u00a0\n\n1. being massively participatory: do you have any proof that people are motivated to fill in the blanks by editing someone else's map? Because of the subjective meanings of the relationships between elements, I find it difficult to jump in and contribute to an existing map. I'd rather start a new one and follow my own thought process. But the what you end up with is a lot of maps that are used very little. Not sure if that's a problem to you as all the data is anyway aggregated in the system (and maybe that's your main goal), but here at ER we have a similar problem with the Projects listed by contributors, which follow the power law distribution pattern present in most online networks. Very few turn out to engage more than the initial contributor(s), unless a big help is provided by the minority stewarding the platform. And that is problematic, because what happens is that when new people show up, they most likely won't be joining projects that are harder to grasp or find because the system buries them to make room for the new ones.\n\n2. scaling: how does one make sense of an already complex map (eg <a href=\"http://metamaps.cc/maps/51\">Metamaps Ops</a>) that will get increasingly bigger? The solid networks will keep on growing, and even if the core people in the network will strive to map every new relationship, it can still become impossible for newcomers or outsiders to make sense of it, therefore defeating the purpose. And that may not depend on how much of a visual thinker you are, it could just become practically illegible.. or not?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-09 10:08:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.498433", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 462, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14348], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11373, "user_id": 1086, "topic_id": 1660, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hallo Alberto!

In Europe (EU) the price setting method for prescription drugs is strictly regulated (and it's within this framework that the EU-members can negotiate the\u00a0prices), while in the US they follow the free market principle which leaves room for misuse and pricing agreements (which happens\u00a0in the US for insulin) between the pharmaceutical companies. I\n\nThe coming years, the much cheaper,\u00a0 biosimilars for some types of insulin will hit the market (one already this year\u00a0in Belgium), so the insulin producing companies would like to cash in on the insulin while they can. See this article for some background: <a href=\"http://www.diabetesforecast.org/2016/mar-apr/rising-costs-insulin.html?referrer=https://www.google.be/\">http://www.diabetesforecast.org/2016/mar-apr/rising-costs-insulin.html?referrer=https://www.google.be/</a>\n\nIn Belgium insulin is considered as a A-class or essential drug, therefore the patient pays\u00a0nothing for it (this is the case in most EU-countries).\u00a0The yearly cost/patient using insulin in Belgium: 1414\u20ac for the insulin and 5175\u20ac for the care (in 2012). Mind you, this is for a patient without any complications. In general, cost of a person with diabetes was between\u00a05.650 \u2013 10.737 \u20ac.\n\nI would like to quote from the article which I linked above:\n\n\u201cSo, where are these generic forms of insulin? Currently, there are no generic insulin products in the US, and the reason why is complicated. For one, insulin is considered a biologic rather than small-molecule drug because it\u2019s made from living cells, and all generic forms of biologics, called biosimilars, are subject to more stringent approval standards than small-molecule generics. <strong>So it\u2019s much more expensive, more complex, and more difficult to achieve a \u201ccopy\u201d of the original.</strong>\n\nBecause of the larger financial burden of manufacturing biosimilars, they would likely not lead to the same 90% price reduction seen with other generic meds. Experts estimate that it would be more like a 20 to 40%, though most are leaning toward the low end of that range. Still, that should bring down the price of some of the most costly insulin.\n\nHow soon until we see a biosimilar hit U.S. markets? Abasaglar, a pen-based version of insulin glargine manufactured by Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim, is approved as a biosimilar in Europe and as a follow-on medication called Basaglar (a drug similar to an already approved product) in the United States. The launch date is currently December 2<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>016.\u201d\n\nI think the real challenge lies in the transformation from\u00a0a curative healthcare to a preventive healthcare, which implies a more durable solution for this healthcare problem/burden. Education, information &amp; awareness, prevention remain\u00a0important.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-03 19:16:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:39.562773", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 517, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 50.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15736], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1907, "user_id": 809, "topic_id": 1874, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>Imagining Life in a Direct Democracy</strong>\n\nThis article is a follow \u2013up of my previous article <a href=\"http://athensdialogues.chs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/athensdialogues.woa/wa/dist?dis=90\">\u201c A modern revival of Greek democracy\u201d</a>, imagining a functional direct democratic system.\n\nExcerpt from my previous article :\n\n\u201cThis is my personal vision of how a direct democratic system could function:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>All citizens should take part in the decision-making process. Citizens should approve or reject new laws by secure daily electronic voting.</li>\n\n<li>The expert\u2019s work should focus on drafting laws and presenting them to the people. Mass media should help by bringing those themes up for debate, explaining them, and encouraging people to participate.</li>\n\n<li>Citizens should come up with concrete solutions to the country\u2019s problems. They should also be able to formulate laws proposals. Citizens\u2019 solutions should be discussed, amended, voted on, and eventually implemented. \u201c</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Follow \u2013up </strong>\n\nThis is a concrete proposal of how could the direct democratic system mentioned above function in practice, in a given state and in the frame of a given set of social and political rules.\n\n\u00a0Part 1- Steps of the law-making procedure :\n\n1.Citizens create a list of problems and they also propose a list of possible solutions to these problems.\n\n2. These proposals are then sent to specialists, each problem &amp; corresponding set of solutions sent to the experts that are best prepared to understand the issue and the suggested solutions.\n\n3. Professionals &amp; specialists select all viable (technically possible) solutions.\n\n4. Specialists re-phrase the problem, providing more details about its context, causes and effects.\n\n5. Experts re-publish the problem along with the selected list of viable solutions.\n\n6. Citizens vote &amp; comment the new list of solutions.\n\n7. The most voted solutions are once again reviewed by specialists whom further explore the top solutions\u2019 applicability and feasibility.\n\n8. A law draft including the top solutions is formulated and published.\n\n9.\u00a0 Citizens make amendments and the most voted amendments are included into the law draft.\n\n10. The law is subjected to an online secure referendum (compulsory voting ) . There are three voting options : YES, NO , and MAYBE.\n\n\u00a0If a majority of citizens vote YES , the law is approved.\n\nIf a majority of citizens vote NO, the law is rejected and the procedure is re-started from step 1.\n\nIf a majority of citizens vote MAYBE , the law is rejected and the procedure is re-started from step 9.\n\n<u>Glossary of terms :</u>\n\nCitizens = everyone residing in a certain territory. They are supposed to vote in all referendums, but they only take part in the law drafting procedure (adding comments and voting proposals) voluntarily, if and whenever they are interested.\n\nReferendum = electronic referendums are held every day and citizens are supposed to vote a package of up to 5 laws . The vote is compulsory and provides three options (\u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d and \u201cmaybe\u201d).\n\nExperts =Citizens who have knowledge and experience of certain issues. They are professionals, community leaders or elders. They take on assignments based on their interests &amp; availability. They are selected by the community through direct voting .Their work is paid. Experts\u2019 role is to document the problem and explain it in simple, but clear words in order to make it comprehensible for non-specialists. They also have the duty of analyzing and eliminating all solutions which are technically impossible. Furthermore, they are supposed to document the most voted solutions and technically improve them, to make ideas stronger.\u00a0 In a direct democratic system, at least one third of the population works part-time or full-time as experts.\n\nPart 2-The Administration\n\nLaws are implemented by the administration. \u00a0People working in the executive and central administration are voted for temporary positions, and they only stay in office as long as they prove to be honest and reliable. People working in the local administration are selected locally, according to each community\u2019s specific rules and procedures , but always respecting democratic principles.\n\nExecutive &amp; central administration:\n\nThe professionals working in administration are voted in or out every 6 or 12 months depending on their job profile. At elections time, citizens are able to decide whether they want to keep them, remove them or, the third option, \u201cpunish\u201d them by cutting their salaries for a few months. These professionals are treated as state employees and enjoy fewer privileges than modern day politicians. At the end of 6 /12 months period, they need to be able to explain exactly how they spent the allocated money, and prove it through legal documents. Official contracts compel them to respect the legally binding promises they have to make at the beginning of their mandates. If they fail to respect their contracts, they are legally dismissed.\n\nThose with executive power and /or candidates for higher positions are voted as individuals , while those who occupy lower ranks are voted as part of teams. Candidates for jobs in administration are professionals, not politicians and they are only allowed to candidate for those positions they have expertise in . Those candidates who want to be considered for a certain position, yet lack the needed experience to get voted, can offer to work voluntarily for periods of three to six months . At the end of the volunteering period , citizens evaluate their performance and decide whether they want to keep them or not.\n\nLocal administration :\n\nAt the local level, decisions are made by self-organized non-hierarchical citizen councils . These citizen councils are free to decide upon the preferred way of self-functioning, including admission procedures, voting rules, internal regulations, remuneration vs volunteer work,etc. Nevertheless, all citizen councils need to function on a democratic basis ( direct democracy or representative democracy) and are compelled to provide membership to diverse social categories : young people, women, elder people, minorities and migrants, socially disadvantaged people -the poor, disabled, unemployed, \u00a0people at risk of social exclusion, etc.\n\n<u>Glossary of terms</u> :\n\nElections = national elections which are held every 6 or 12 months (unlike referendums which are held daily and only consist in voting on law proposals). Citizens vote candidates for positions in the executive and central administration. Candidates can be approved or rejected, or ,if they are already in function, re-appointed, dismissed or subjected to penalties. Voting in elections is not compulsory, yet candidates need to be approved with a significant number of votes before they can be appointed.\n\nCandidates = highly-skilled professionals who have experience working in the administration OR citizens who many not initially qualify for a position, but volunteer to work for free and are then subjected to a special evaluation process. Thus, any person has the chance to candidate and be considered for a position.\n\nLocal administration = municipalities, cities &amp; towns, districts of larger cities, etc., and other communities who self- organize according to democratic principles. The citizens\u2019 councils are non-hierarchical and they either function according to representative democracy rules ( council\u00a0 members are elected by the general population and then they \u00a0make decisions with a majority rule), either implement direct democracy ( council members help the local community implement a local direct democratic voting system in order to allow all citizens to participate equally). Ideally, in a direct democratic system more than a half of the population should be included in one way or another in a local council.\n\n<em>How to accommodate increased political participation with personal &amp; professional life ?</em>\n\nIn the direct democracy scenario, employers shorten the work schedule and allow people to integrate their careers with their political participation goals . Thus, people dedicate only 3-4 hours/day to their daily jobs , while spending around 2-3 hours/day voting , learning about different challenges and designing solutions.

If you think we've missed a key question, have entirely different set of questions that you believe should be asked, please speak now.\n\nThe next area that we covered in the co-writing session was the process for shortlisting and selecting pledges/applications to unMonastery. The current approach looks like this (but lets be clear, this is open to debate):\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tThe International Call goes online in the next two weeks.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tApplications are submitted between now and the end of the year.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAll applications are reviewed by a panel on a rolling 2 month basis.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tThe panel is made up of MT2019 comittee, Alberto, myself and a nominated individual from Matera</li>\n\n<li>\t\tEach application is evaluated based on a criteria of meeting the key challenges and skills needed (this criteria will be outlined clearly alongside the international call)</li>\n\n<li>\t\tThose that meet the criteria are shortlisted and asked to create a post (in what ever form) online outlining their project, this can then be discussed and peer reviewed.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tBased on this process and ensuing discussion the panel will then make a final decision.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThere are a couple of reasons for taking this approach, firstly it's important to highlight that although individuals are not paid for participating in the unMonastery project directly, they do receive space, resources and a monthly allowance for their project \u2013 this money is coming from public funds and thus there is a need to be made accountable for how this is spent.\n\nThe second reason is internal resources on the part of unMonastery, we actually don't know how many applications to expect but unMonastery is increasingly recieving more and more press despite having yet to actively court it. unMonastery has already appeared on <a href=\"http://www.shareable.net/tag/unmonastery\" target=\"_blank\">Shareable</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2013/03/22/puo-un-hacker-farsi-monaco-si-accade-nei-sassi-di-matera-con-il-progetto-europeo-un-monastery_n_2931132.html\" target=\"_blank\">Huffington Post</a>, is set to be featured in the Italian issue of Wired and has appeared on numerous others sites \u2013 so this may mean that application numbers are very high. Which creates a problem, unMonastery in this moment is almost entirely run on volunteered time, meaning dealing with a high in take requires a workable approach based on time and resources available.\n\nRegardless of what has been stated so far it's important that the process stay open for debate and we'd like to be 100% transparent in establishing this process. It can at this point take an entirely different form, however we need to decide soon, really soon \u2013 so all suggestions and discussion is welcomed.\n\nAnother point to consider is that we have already put out a call to the EdgeRyders network, for which we've recieved a number of strong applications, aside from a few email updates we've dithered slightly on accepting anyone whilst we got this process in place \u2013 this to me though feels slightly unfair \u2013 and I apologise you haven't been kept more up-to-date. It's my feeling that right now 1 or 2 of those applications should be accepted and the others are given the option to respond or rewrite their application according to the challenges laid out.\n\nI'd like to also float at this point another possibility, we are limited to a maximum of 10 unMonasterians at any one time primarily because of budgetery constraints - I though think it could create an interesting shift if individuals were to attain funding for projects and bring them into unMonastery in this way. Myself, Anthony and Gaia are currently in the midst of an application to the Nominet Trust to build a specific set of tools that will enivitably fund additional people coming to stay at unMonastery and we've factored these costs into the bid.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-05-28 12:11:49", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 05:26:39.875168", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 816, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14880, "user_id": 1988, "topic_id": 2719, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Clear, will start working on them\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-29 13:05:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:23.828307", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3266, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 3233, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Today\u2019s community call discussion was centered primarily around fleshing out and interrogating what\u2019s meant by the term \u2018Stewardship\u2019 and how a narrative can be built around the LOTE4 event which will takes it as it\u2019s theme. We discussed at length the process for building the event, what the key questions are that we should be asking, formats that might work and existing initiatives that might be involved or we can learn from. The minutes are as follows. \n\nI\u2019ve taken the liberty of refining a set of actionables relating to each area that either came out of discussion or refined from suggestions! \n\nDefining the Stewardship\n\nInitial conversation focused on an explanation of what myself and Nadia have built so far for the LOTE program. The first provisional draft can be found here: [lote4 the stewardship program](https://edgeryders.eu/t/1st-draft-of-lote4-program/3114) and the organising space can be found here: [/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359-the-stewardship](/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359-the-stewardship)\n\nVictor suggested that MBA lecturer Mintzberg had written and researched extensively on the topics we are poking at and recommened this phamphlet - [rebalancing society pamphlet.pdf](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ieL2TGR5wJ9y1WEuRQfPzMhG3zTbQZzH) - he suggested there was a chance we could have him skype in to LOTE4. More can be found here: [http://www.mintzberg.org/](http://www.mintzberg.org/)\n\nDorotea: \u201cI think the Mintzberg pamphlet is really worth a ready, it gives a strong theoretical/intellectual basis to this discussion I think\u201d\n\nNadia proposed a straightforward definition to be: Stewards: individuals or groups of individuals who feel a sense of responsibility towards the commons. \n\nIn discussing this, Jeff highlighted that there is a risk through the use of the term \u201ccommunity\u201d that could result in a sort of segregation or exclusivity: \"you're either in the community or you're not\"\n \nIn order to avoid getting trapped by semantic segregation or a flimsiness to the idea of \u2018Stewardship\u2019 my suggestion was that we act with clear and concrete examples when we discuss the topic in order to contextualise and begin bringing people in to participate and build traction for the event. \n\nMy examples was the Heygate Estate, a public owned housing estate which was sold off to a private development firm at a loss but also at the cost of displacing many families - in the years that follow a community has sprung up around the estate to organise events and community garden but the property developers plan to demolish the building to build luxury flats continues.\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heygate_Estate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heygate_Estate)\n\nOther examples given: \n\nNadia: impossible living [http://www.impossibleliving.com/](http://www.impossibleliving.com/)\n\nMaria: New York: community land trust. [http://nyccli.org/](http://nyccli.org/)\n\nNadia: Milan\u2019s transfer of disused properties (*Note* In relation to Milan, we had one of the people from the municipality responsible for giving out property come for dinner at unMonastery and he said he'd be happy to help in future.)\n\nJeff: Digital Stewards [https://commotionwireless.net/blog/2014/04/18/digital-stewardship-and-your-community/](https://commotionwireless.net/blog/2014/04/18/digital-stewardship-and-your-community/) / [https://commotionwireless.net/blog/category/digital-stewards/](https://commotionwireless.net/blog/category/digital-stewards/)\n\nTalking through such examples, Nadia posed the question \u201dis it viable that people behind those initiatives would come and share their experiences in exchange for people with skills working on their projects?\u201d\n\nVictor: \u201cI like the idea in general, but need to think what concrete things we could work on in the project.\n\nthe topics need to feel very relevant to the participants, and make clear where there is overlap. plus good facilitation. It might make sense to pick focus areas in each topic. e.g. need to be online and offline these days, and here edgeryders has a lot of experience.\u201d \n\nVictor went on to emphasis the </span><span>interesting angle and strength of EdgeRyders is in combining offline and online in community stewardship of assets and communities. Hybrid commons projects that acknowledge what's the right tool/strategy (online&amp;offline) for each context.\n\nEdgeRyders itself is exploring how you take largely online community to do offline things. How to close the online offline loop/cycle effectively, which Victor pointed out A) very interesting B) very timely C) something that edgeryders has experience with\n\nJeff highlighted in respect to this anthropological research on artistic communities, which he\u2019ll share.\n\nEncouraging the idea  for us to make individual calls and figure out where these group are or/and go and visit personally. (*Thought*: maybe we know people who already visited them) \n\nSome debate focused around the motivations for our framing of \u2018The Stewardship\u2019 and it\u2019s goals, provocated by Jeff\u2019s assertion that currently it reads as a very interdisciplinary approach and which risks being amateurish unless there is substance behind the concepts you want to throw out there. The main points of divergence which can be summarised as follows: Critical vs. promotional discourse / people doing things vs theoretical discourse / positive outcome vs necessary outcome\n\nVictor point: focus on the practical stuff, getting things done via makerfox, setting up international mentoring and coaching. Especially online and offline. Dont try to do abstract theoretical stuff.\n\nActionables: \n\n* Create a wiki for collectively listing case studies and examples.\n\n* Jeff to share anthropological studies that he\u2019s been researching. \n\n* Maria to approach groups in New York.\n\n* Construct an initial questionnaire so each of us can go out and interview groups, online and off. \n\n* Potentially set up a road trip to go and visit initiatives and invite them (similar to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeMT9YQaphM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeMT9YQaphM))\n\n* Create group hangouts as \u2018Stewardship Summits\u2019 inviting the initiatives we want to work with, as sorts of online panels.\n\n* Natahalie offer to do communication, writing, social media support and search for people in Paris that meet our criteria.\n\nFollowing this we begun to discuss financial viability, raising the examples of  Goteo a commons funding site and the example of our collaborators  Las Indias; Who raised the question with us last week \u201cWho knows the interesting initiatives invisible to the anglocentric internet?\u201d\n\n///// Thing Nik joined the call. After short summary of our discussion I tried to make the approach specific to the context Nik is operating in, the conversation ran as follows:\n\nBen: When we were at Vake park someone asked us what other initiatives and strategies currently exist that aim to overturn development plans? Who can help us with that? What we were saying is projects like unMonastery and occupations of space might fall under stewardship. So how do we create a viable event that can support those projects, but also advance the conversation and concepts...what do we mean by stewardship or custodianship in these contexts?\n\nNik: Are we talking about organisational issues or what kind of people you want to be involved? In case of vake park I could give concrete examples of stuff we do in certain cases, but don't really get how concept of stewardship applies.\n\nBen: The approach we want to take is to 1) gather case studies and different groups 2) we haven't defined what stewardship means yet, this is part of the event and one of the tracks would be dedicated to that, asking questions like: Do we think this bottom up management/taking care of public spaces is a good thing? What is required for it to be successful, metrics of success? E.g Vake park: keeping development out, getting public to develop understanding and attempts of social activism: other groups using vake park as example to set up local protests in other parts of the word\n\nJeff to Nik: your park is an example of geometric capitalism, it's happening worldwide. it's an attempt to further constrict the captive markets of urban space..\n\nNik: to people like us, regular citizens who don\u2019t have political power as individuals, only when come together. We ask them to come around and find out what we do, and join forces with us if they find the cause worthy. The other category of people who help us in fighting the establishment. They don't work for free, we have no pro bono lawyers. So we have to fundraise to cover the costs. We're not an organisation and we are trying not to cross that line into becoming an NGO. We gather donations, and money for certain causes e.g. taking company to court and winning.\n\n(*Thought* - OK so we need to do a stakeholder mapping.)\n\nNIk: We have to make it known to our government that there is a desire or demand for what we are asking of them e.g. the EU association agreement or through other govt reps. \n\nNadia: Can you speak about how the \\#futurespotters event is useful in this respect? So we can think of it in relation to LOTE4.\n\nNik: The networking component, and meeting all the people who have a range of ideas that sometimes do apply to our cause. I distilled some things from most of what I heard into things that will work here. I also met people who live in Georgia but never knew. We live next door but never meet, our outlooks are so similar and we have so many resources we could use to help one another here. Essentially networking, new information, good experience doing the session. \n\nIn doing the session I managed to organise the theoretical stuff and knowledge I had about the movement and sort them into a system in order to make it clearer to people who were not part of this. When you teach a course you learn a lot more about the subject than as a student. That gave me a new outlook, what we have done, what we have achieved and where we have failed . Which I wouldn't have done if I hadnt done the session.\n\n/////// The conversation then veered into discussion of how others might join and what\u2019s at stake for them - we spent sometime discussing the use of MakerFox as a ticket barter system for the event. \n \nJames responded by saying: if people are not already aligned and working on projects when they arrived, then people will spend 50% of their time communicating and working out what the project is before you even begin. It has to be initially enabling people to communicate what the project is about, what skills they have to share and what skills they need. This is hard, people don't do it naturally. Makerfox might be a useful tool for this. \n\nIf we help people to communicate in an open way at first, and then allow structure to emerge after.. It may be that an idea you have dormant is suddenly actionable because of the skills available in the room.\n\napproach 1) we have a need, if people cannot do it we need funding 2) we have a need and it cannot happen unless there are the skills voluntarily contributed. If offers aren\u2019t there a project doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nDorotea: The MakerFox approach could work, if people putting out the offers and needs. If it doesn't work in the process we could say \"but we still need that\". a process which is adjusting itself while still underway\n\nBen: My general feeling is that we're prototyping 1) use of makerfox 2) new style of event not legible to everyone. My expectation is that people will get a sense of possibility for organising things in that way but it won\u2019t just all fall into place. The greatest gain will be in creating visibility for all the work and effort that goes into an event like LOTE. As a result we will likely have more helping hands to get things moving because the actionables are much clearer.", "created_at": "2014-07-03 13:03:29", "updated_at": "2018-04-24 16:27:14.362106", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1992, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1504], "is_private": false}, {"id": 533, "user_id": 3408, "topic_id": 500, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The Orange House in the heart of Athens is changing the negative image about refugees through the cultivation of social skills.\n\nI am involved in refugee care as a volunteer since years because several of my friends are refugees. My partner, Hassan, comes from Syria and also had to cross the Aegean Sea. Last year, when I saw the gaps in the official structures for refugee \u00a0relief, I decided to create the Orange House. Many non-Greek volunteers offered to give money if I decided to build something. At first, we only thought of one room, because we didn\u2019t have a lot of cash. But then, we found this house that was not used for several months. In fact, it was an old electronics and computer shop. Slowly, I started asking for help and people got involved with all things related to opening a space that would offer human shelter. This was the beginning of the Orange House, which opened in May 2016.\n\nThe house has three floors, the upper one reserved for resident refugees who live inside it. They cook, clean and take care of the space by themselves. We rarely enter their space, unless some maintenance work is necessary. On the ground floor, there is a common space for everyone, which hosts several classes and sessions: from yoga to music, salsa dancing, and movie screenings. We use the half-basement, as a classroom for language classes, including Greek, English, Spanish, French and German on different levels. We also have a room in which we just meet to talk with each other and other spaces for storing clothes, glasses, food, educational material, bathing towels, etc. There is a kitchen and bathroom for people to walk in, a courtyard and a simple roof garden to grow vegetables in self-made contained made of old cargo palettes. The Orange House hosts a specialized 2-hour LGBT program for refugees every Monday, also visited by a guy from an Athens checkpoint to meet and offer help to the community.\u00a0\n\nOur house is open for visits by NGOs, artists, gardeners and everyone who wishes to offer creative inputs, such as salsa, music classes, or just brainstorm on what we can do better. It is hard to say how many people visit the common space. Some people come for a specific activity like a lesson in German or French. Some other women bring their kids for all day long. Volunteers can also attend classes and other activities, which are offered totally free. However, we are planning to be able to make some items to sell, such as cooked food or jewelry made by some of the residents. Our idea for the future of the house is that the refugees in collaboration with the wider community will be able to generate their own money through the skills they have and develop. For example, we have some women with a talent for cooking, hairdressing, and Arabic calligraphy. The idea is that one day all this will evolve to a social enterprise, where residents in the Orange House will be their own boss.\n\nThe operations of the house are managed by the community. For example, an Iranian woman is teaching someone else to do jewelry. Same goes with all housekeeping, like cooking and cleaning.\u00a0\n\nWe now want to register as a legal entity, in order to be able to manage funds. At the moment, I am renting the house under my name, paying 1000 euro for a monthly rent, and another 1000 for utility bills. The volunteers of the Orange House usually bring some cash and then we ask it they can change that lamp, or cover some other cost. We always have one volunteer sleeping inside the house, and we have a schedule of who is coming and for what reason. There are no public authorities or institutions involved in the project. We are just like that. Mohammed, one of the board members, works as a doctor for Doctors of the World and brings useful information about persons that need shelter. Some other NGOs also visit us to see in there are any needs.\u00a0\n\nPeople usually appreciate what we do and the way we do it. When I tell them \u201clook at me, I am Greek-French and I look like this\u201d. Or when they see me together with my Syrian partner. I am Christian and he is Muslim, and some people think that this is something strange. But we know how to laugh about it, and tell them that these refugees are not terrorists or criminals, but humans like everyone else.\n\nWhen we first entered the house in May 2016, the place was so dirty and so many things were in need of repair. I knew since the beginning that it will be a lot of work, that I will need to work two weeks full time to get everything going. But this was not true at all because it takes much more time than I initially thought. Together we are taking very good care of our space. No alcohol, smoking or drugs are allowed in the Orange House. We check who is coming in and the neighborhood feels reassured. When people see refugees doing a yoga or salsa class, they have a different image of them. Instead of seeing the of misery, like on the Lesbos island or other camps shown on TV, we show that we grow happiness and care for the community. When we started, we noticed that most people don't know how to speak a language other than theirs. This is why we called the place \u201cOrange House\u201d because the word \u201corange\u201d sounds similarly in Greek and Arabic. We also painted the house in orange color, so people coming for the first time can distinguish it easily. At the beginning, the biggest problem was bureaucracy. I didn\u2019t know whom to address to get information on how to set up an organization. Someone suggested a lawyer, but I am still waiting for the paperwork since two months. We didn\u2019t face any conflicts with the legal system because we are very careful of what we do inside the house. We brought engineers, social workers, and another expert to advise us and ensure that what we do is not something illegal.\n\nWhen we were almost done with all the work, I posted a poster in Greek, explaining to neighbors that what they see is the preparation of a house and school for refugees. We made a house-warming party, and we invited everyone to join, see for themselves and ask questions. This is a process of building trust. At the end of the day, there was only one neighbor that came to ask. Most people simply don\u2019t care, otherwise, we could have more reaction. The house currently hosts 15 residents. We can only accept up to 20 persons because we only have 3 bathrooms, which is the major limitation. We explain to everyone that they must contribute to housekeeping, participate in the training programs and that it is important that we share everything. We cannot be with someone that wants to be alone in the bedroom, for example. It is not possible for us. There are about 50 people that visit the Orange House to receive some sort of service. For example, a 16-year-old who is very lonely and comes just to speak with others. Many of our visitors are staying in squats, camps of other shelters where conditions are not very good, but they come to the house because they like the atmosphere. When a visitor comes we offer tea, we talk and listen, but also sing and dance. It is really like a house, not like a social service type of place.\u00a0\n\nResidency is only open to women and children, but male visitors are also welcome to join in the activities. Most of the male refugees arrived earlier, so the majority of the people arriving now in Greece are women and children. Quite often, we have women that have suffered some sort of abuse. We have listened to some very tough stories. Most of the volunteers are refugees themselves, or people coming from abroad and then going back home. Many people think volunteers need only shelter and food. But the reality asks for the development of real skills, to help them integrate into the society, but also have some fun. It is hard to find people that are not skilled to refugee care, but they have specific skills. What we need to have is a salsa or a hip hop teacher, or somebody that can help with the roof garden. For example, one of my friends is an electrician and is coming to do maintenance work in the building, for free.\n\nAnyone entering the house as a resident has to commit to attending 5 classes per week. Therefore, there is at least one activity taking place in some of the spaces every day. Sometimes, we organize outdoor activities, like hiking excursions. Refugees that benefit from the training programs at the Orange House are progressing their social skills very fast in. When a mother with a 17-year-old son arrived in May they spoke Farsi. They are now speaking fluent English. This is because everybody is connected through some sort of social action. The transformations we observe, offer some very important lessons. One of them is about the importance of patience, even when you are passionate about something. Starting a community of care is like planting a tree, and needs time to develop. There are times that you see things going wrong and always question what doesn\u2019t work. But, actually, it is important to not give up and say that you have to try again. That you will tease many people, but at the end, it will work out. Over time, I am learning how to be more grateful for every progress that is happening inside the house. Any positive impact is important.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-14 18:43:03", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 15:13:43.854774", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1695, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 81.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3993, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3960, "post_number": 1, "raw": "As seed content for the upcoming collaborative <a href=\"/t/harmonious-hackathon-funding-possibilities-to-be-found/3908/7\">research effort to identify funding opportunities</a> for Edgeryders-ish projects, here is what the [PayCoupons](https://pay.coupons/) project has collected / found out so far.

Beside the online work yunity is aswell an offline comunity which cames out of the movement of foodsharing, which has sofar 100.000 members. Creating yunity is then aswell about turing foodsharing international.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI'm highly interested in creating <strong>social architecture</strong> which is creates a culture to allow effectively colaboration in <strong>agile selforganized networks</strong>. To open up the silos a lot of organisation are caged, with the intention of lifting each others ideas up. In here I'm interested in online same as offline networks.\n\nOne of my intention is to connect with all the different projects working on same ideas. One outcome of my dream would be an <strong>opensource</strong> tool which provides agile network with any kind of tool is needen/helpfull to manage projects without the need of fixed structure but <strong>selforganized</strong>.\n\nIf anything of this sounds interesting to you and you'll love to colaborate together with other projects leave me a message.\n\nFor the upcomming month there is planed an event which is called <strong>yucon</strong>.\n\nThe yucon is a\u00a0 event, theme: \"your dreams into reality.\" It's self-<strong>organized</strong> event to experience <strong>freedom</strong> while creating a playground to support <strong>collaboration</strong>. It will be organized and hosted after the philosophy of <strong>uncondional</strong> <strong>sharing</strong> OpenSpace and WouldCafe like settings will invite to rethink old habbits, aswell in finding aproches while beeing in a colaborative process and experience a enthusiasm way of learning.\n\nAlso to break down \"Silos\" organisations, activists and interested people are quiet often \"caged\". Which is then about supporting the idea of \"cocreating free of limit\", which goes hand in hand with the colaborative comunication tool \"DragonEye\"\n\nBut aswell also to experience communitcation/expression in all kind of ways.

Which will be a moving platforms\u00a0 to connect different networks towards each other, but also to host workshops, create events, direct action, musik, building and so on. We're looking for vans and active people. :-)\n\nAswell I'm looking for a team of 9-30 activists interested in traveling togheter with the aim, while using oasis game simliar tactics, to create a social architecture based on collaboration.

I'd like to discuss the organisation (which I'd like to keep to the necessary minimum, to keep people most space, while still offering some kind of guidelines that could be helpful) of the documentation/harvesting, and thought it could be helpful if I layed out my thoughts about possible \"how tos\" before the call. So here we go:\n\nWhat I'd do before LOTE:\n\n- Explain why documenting/harveting is important and valuable and invite people to document / collect what they learned/heared during the different sessions. It can be one person per session or several. If it's more than one, they can be suggested TitanPad (which someone else would have to explain, please) as a way to work on the document together (unless they're already comfortable using some other tools like google docs or whatever).\n\n- Explain different possible roles:\n\n\"session journalist\"\n\n*day journalist, who captures the flow and what happened besides the sessions/talks\n\n*fotographer\n\n*video journalist\n\n*mischievous question seeker\n\n*whatever other way people come up with and feel called to collect\"\n\n- Set up wiki with each session listen, for people to add their names to the session they will do documentation on. Take mail addresses to be able to follow up after event for collection of the material. (I have no idea how you did this travel wiki list, but I'd find it very practical for this matter. Can someone either teach me or set that up for documentation of the talks/sessions?)\n\n- Possibility to find out what questions people are moved by - what really brings them to the event? That would be a first piece of harvest. A first idea about what is already happening in the group.\n\n- Create Wiki, where the harvesting documents will be linked to afterwards, so everything can be found in one place, example:\n\nDay 1\n\nLink to pictures taken\n\nLink to posting \"Records of session 1\"\n\nRecords of session 2\n\netc.\n\nPersonal reflection pieces and harvest of the \"collective sensemaking\"\n\nWhat I like about that is that the content can be found easily, but people can still engage on the topic of the session in the separate threads.\n\nDuring LOTE:\n\n- Find last volunteers to document session that aren't covered in advance.\n\nShould work, I think. We don't necessarily HAVE to know who's the scribe for 100 % of the sessions. At least I imagine people will jump in spontaneously if needed. \"Worst\" case: maybe the speaker will be able to make a summary available? What do you think?\n\n-\n\n- We'll try to encourage some personal reflection, try to deepen the conversations by finding the questions in the room and harvest people's insights on a personal level along the way. This will happen on the spot and is rather going to be planned about a week in advance. What can be thought about already are juicy questions :)\n\nAfter LOTE:\n\n- Ask people to upload their harvest as a post on this forum (in a possible sub-section?) or on hackpad (mail addresses needed for kind reminders). Update Wiki with links in chronological order of talks/sessions.\n\nMy goal: Give all the explanations about the \"how tos\" in advance to not worry about it during event, because I will need space for the not-technology-based offline harvesting. Post it's and stuff :)\n\nPlease tell me what you think. As I said, I'm not very techie, so I hope this will work in your eyes. If not, I'm looking forward to additional ideas.\n\n\"See\" you on wednesday (I'll join shortly after 11:30)\n\nKaja\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-01 22:12:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:38.457039", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 716, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15400], "is_liked_by": [2980], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27017, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1129, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Why it's failing</b>\n\n<span>o</span><span>ne reason for the inconsistencies in practicing research,\u00a0lack of speed in updating what is considered state of the art knowledge in the field or other assumptions i'm reading in your statement Pedro,\u00a0may lay in the very mode of producing research, in a way that's not transparent and generous enough with its producers - all the people contributing with data, and working to advance\u00a0practice in the fields.

Peer to peer. The ethos is that there isn't any point in waiting for someone else to solve the problems: if we don't build the solutions ourselves with our minds and bodies, they won't get built. Together we have managed to pull off ambitious projects like the\u00a0<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/82554988\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">unMonastery</a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a href=\"/economy-app\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">Economy app</a>\u00a0with very little means. In doing so we have learned that we are one another's best resource.\n\n<h3>Get paid to connect awesome projects and connect people creating positive change.</h3>\n\n<strong>We're creating a tour bringing together people doing inspiring things in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia with their peers from different parts of the world.</strong>\u00a0Rather than working in a top- down manner, we prefer it if people active on the local scene are involved in shaping the initiative from the beginning. The contents of the workshop in each country will be heavily based on the online discussion. So we are making a budget available to people who can help build engagement and drive participation in the online platform ahead of, during and after the tour. If you know of people doing interesting work in either of the three countries (maybe you are one of them), are active in the local scene as well as on social media and speak either Arabic, Armenian or Georgian you're probably eligible for one of the paid work opportunities we publish in the <a href=\"/groups/spot-the-future\">Spot The Future group</a>.\n\n<h3>Get paid for sharing information about inspiring projects.</h3>\n\n<strong>We are building a useful online knowledge resource, mutual support community and collaboration opportunities for and by change-makers.</strong>\u00a0After the tour, we envision the online contributions to be further developed into individual articles (2500 words), meant for publication in digital format for and by participants. As well as in the final deliverable to the UNDP. Each article selected for the final publication will be paid for*. And released for free under a creative commons license.\n\n<h3>Travel and meet other people doing awesome social projects.</h3>\n\n<strong>A number of selected contributors to the online conversation and local workshops of the tour will be invited to an international conference in Georgia, with their travel expenses covered by Edgeryders</strong>. The conference is a unique opportunity for people doing interesting work in your community to come together with peers from other parts of the world, inspire one another and help each other.\n\n<h3>Why now?</h3>\n\nWhile a few of us are in Central and South America, India and South Africa, most of the 1800+ community members are based in Europe.\u00a0<strong>We want to reach out to our peers in other parts of the world to explore how we can learn from and support one another's work. P2p. And we've built a nice opportunity to do so together with anyone and everyone who wants to be involved</strong>.\n\nBasically we made a compelling case that the UNDP should launch a so called \"foresight\" exercise in three countries modelled on the Edgeryders way of doing things...and they agreed!\u00a0The principle in Edgeryders is that the people who do the work call the shots: now is the perfect time to get involved in shaping this initiative as we are just getting started!\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>You can learn more about the actual initiative on the Edgeryders blog:\u00a0<a href=\"/groups/blog/edgeryders-helps-undp-spot-the-future-in-armenia-georgia-and-egypt\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">https://edgeryders.eu/groups/blog/edgeryders-helps-undp-spot-the-future-in-armenia-georgia-and-egypt</a>\n</li>\n\n<li>And about Edgeryders: <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2014/03/08/the-business-corporation-as-a-symbiont-to-a-community-edgeryders-crosses-a-watershed/\">http://www.cottica.net/2014/03/08/the-business-corporation-as-a-symbiont-to-a-community-edgeryders-crosses-a-watershed/</a>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>How to start?</h3>\n\n<strong>The way it works is that you sign up on the<a href=\"http://www.edgeryders.eu\"> Edgeryders platform</a>,\u00a0create a post saying hello to the rest of the community and telling us a litte about yourself <a href=\"/t/edgeryders/1761\">here</a></strong>. This breaks the ice and makes it easier for everyone to start interacting with you as they know more about what you are interested in. It also makes it easier for us to get the word out about the paid opportunities to people who we know want to join us in building this movement together.\n\nWe hope you'll join us on this shared journey.

Solving the conundrum of personal reluctance to make hard decisions may prove to be our most valuable contribution to \u2018The Process\u2019.\n\nIf the unMonastery is primarily a hub which links local needs with initiatives of a global scope; that which defines us is not our friends who work on the global scene, nor the dinner parties that worked in Matera. \u00a0We need to define what we do in order to cultivate this connection. \u00a0It is written that The Geek shall not inherit the Earth. \u00a0The key moment of the unMonastery contract is service to a vibrant community. \u00a0Without being embedded into such a community we are not living a life unMonastic. \u00a0\n\nIt is a great challenge to see how a Transmediale presence embraces these working principles. \u00a0\u00a0At this moment the going idea is to form a recruitment centre around engaging small groups of people who are playing an as yet to be fleshed out boardgame. \u00a0As more and more tables each become their own unMonastery participants will be confronted with what they can contribute and how their individual skills and concerns can find the resonant walls of a supportive community.\n\nTo present that in an exhibition setting is neither to serve soup, nor to have speeches by others, but to invite all our friends and make them sit down to the unMonastery boards to play a round of unMonastery. So people from Matera, random visitors from Berlin, and the cleverest people we know can try and do the unMonastery together, similar to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang!\">Bang!</a>.\n\nTo design the unMon game we need to define:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tcharacters with descriptions</li>\n\n<li>\t\tconflicts</li>\n\n<li>\t\ta goal to reach by the end of the game</li>\n\n<li>\t\tetc.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIf the game is called The Process, is not the Protocol its set of rules? \u00a0The greater community encourages the naked Athenians to design and play the game ad nauseum.\n\nyours,\n\nThe Jealous Masses\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-17 14:06:17", "updated_at": "2018-05-28 15:40:43.072619", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 503, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 30.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 670, "user_id": 3244, "topic_id": 637, "post_number": 1, "raw": "First Interview/Brainstorm (german):\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u2043\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Thema Sharing / DIY / P2P Frage nach allgemeinem Wohlbefinden der Leute /Community kann das mit gesch\u00e4ftlicher Art und Weise zusammen gebracht werden, oder ist es ehre soziale Geschichte, private Zeit f\u00fcr andere geben, wie kann man eine Symbiose mit Mehrwert f\u00fcr mich und andere schaffen?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u2043\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0S.

What follows is a hilarious 1.5 hr conversation conducted via a combination of voice, sign language, lip reading and chat.\n\nWe were joined by @Pauline and @Omri_Kaufmann from UDK Berlin, @Costantino \u00a0and @ChiaraFrr in Milano, @Nadia\u00a0and a new community member - Christina whose mission with <a href=\"https://themerakipeople.com/about/\">The Meraki People</a> is to restore and preserve the cultural heritage of mount Parnonas in Greece by turning it into a green production and cultural oasis.\n\nIn our intros we discovered most of us approach mental wellbeing in terms of how to make support more accessible - by inventoring and designing solutions, by opening up a conversation. I saw two big strands in the conversation that can inform our search:\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-6658134e-be1a-8cec-b0f1-688f52228235\">A. Is it safer for an online conversation to only deal with the soft side of mental health? That is, exclude suicide and death?\u00a0</b>\n\nNoemi mentioned how deep suicide is in Ireland both among males and females, as well as it is underreported - it\u2019s not even ranking top in Europe (like former Soviet countries). Pauline added that in Sweden, suicide is the most common cause of death in people between 18-35. Costantino said this was dangerous to approach in OpenCare, even though we know it\u2019s increasingly being flagged in the tech activist sector (see re:Publica session <a href=\"https://re-publica.de/16/session/hacking-care\">Hacking with Care</a>).\n\n<a href=\"/t/jus-design-for-vulnerability/645\">Team JUS</a> was on board!\u00a0They\u2019re working on design that explores vulnerability: <em>We want to research objects that people are handling or certain gestures they are doing while in therapy. Can we find a certain patterns in these behaviours or interactions? Maybe we can do something with it? We found in the interviews/chats we started with our peers as well that it was very difficult for them to open up. We also had some observations how to create a sharing environment</em>\n\nTheir design will most probably involve\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\tHuman connection\u00a0- \"if you just throw your thoughts in the air without any feedback it is less interesting than if you are sharing with people with whom you have an intimate relationship\" (Nadia).</li>\n\n<li>\tSome external tokens to facilitate this, like\u00a0objects (bridging connection between repetitive gestures and calming yourself down); maybe\u00a0space (pop-up confession booths).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-6658134e-be1a-8cec-b0f1-688f52228235\">B. Or should we really push ourselves over the edge and experiment? Is there relief in black humor?</b>\n\nThis can be simply by asking people on the streets How are you? and then \"Really, how are you?\". More advanced versions include drawing inspiration from\u00a0funeral traditions involving celebrations of sorts thru\u00a0drinks, food, but also social grieving\u00a0(Eastern Europe,\u00a0Jewish culture,\u00a0Italy, Germany were mentioned). \u00a0.. for the rest I will have to let the notes speak as I won\u2019t do them justice)\n\nN: How would you design for maximum inappropriateness. What are the most inappropriate jokes you can make in a situation where someone is in pain? How do you piss people off at a Jewish funeral? How to make the grieving person forget about their sorrow and want to kill you instead?\n\nN: Because there is some relief in black humour.\n\nP: i love it. dealing with depression through humor and showing your feelings\n\nO: How do we choose who to talk to?\n\nP:'survivors'?\n\nO: I would talk to someone who had a similar experience and can connect with me and understand me.\n\nN: Anonymous emotionalists. \"let the crazy out in small pieces- not all at once\". XYKD did a fantastic comic on depression <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/14txdv/xkcd_honest/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/14txdv/xkcd_honest/</a>\n\nO: 1 I would also talk to someone i know very little or not at all\n\nNe: +1\n\n\"What made you understand that you were depressed\"?\n\nN: My partner said I should probably take a shower.\n\nP: but that's important too! finding the right kind of treatment;\u00a0therapy varies alot depending on the person too,\u00a0the treatment guy\n\nN: Inability to take any decisions. Decision to not go to shrink. Just getting stuck.\n\nP: the scale of our project is probably much smaller than the whole conversation you are interested in having on Edgeryders right?\n\nP: dark horse is there also\n\nC:\u00a0this track to do with emotions and mind etc can be a long term track within opencare;\n\nImperfect, super unreliable tools and unsuitable places to kill yourself.\n\nPlacebo pills\n\nHomeopathic poison pill\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x-bgtlVcqPYZ7J8Vxv5202ito9FklL3S_8d9sc9HaIs/edit#\">Please join our growing group and help build a sensible brief around emotional wellbeing here.</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-17 10:19:57", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 09:02:08.788589", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 992, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 21.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13000, "user_id": 52, "topic_id": 1361, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>the kudos file</b>\n\nI really like this strategy.

Enligthed power, instead, aims at releasing power, or - let's say - multiplying it! And that's the way to increase creativity, and then create progress, even economically, I am sure!\n\nBut, of course, democratic participation does not definitely mean consultation. I think consultation is more harmful than it appears, because it means treating citizens like children and politicians like \"protectors\" who eventually decide. Moreover, it does not trigger the most powerful and important element or participation:\u00a0 collaboration, coordination and sharing. Consultation simply let people to express themselves, but individually! It does not further them to join together and come up with a common solution...which means increasing political/decicional power! Democratic rules are those who encourage people to join and find common solution. Consultation is not such a sort of rule as it (deliberately or <span><span><span>inevitably</span></span></span>) let the people alone...and perhaps strengthen the power of the few.\n\nAs far as I know Canada has (or has had) its own <a href=\"http://www.tni.org/archives/newpol-docs_pbcanada\">PBs</a>: in the city of Guelph, for example, and <a href=\"http://www.torontohousing.ca/participatory_budgeting\">Toronto</a> to some extent.

Merci beaucoup pour ces commentaires, Michel.\n\n1) Le probl\u00e8me du leadership me hante depuis le 1er septembre, depuis ce jour o\u00f9 j'ai re\u00e7u la r\u00e9ponse \"<strong>Il n'y a pas de solution</strong>.\" Je me suis heurt\u00e9e \u00e0 un mod\u00e8le de leadership. Depuis ce temps, je cherche un autre mod\u00e8le, qui conviendrait au gouvernement ouvert. Ma seconde interrogation concerne ceci: une fois qu'un mod\u00e8le de leadership est d\u00e9fini, comment s'y prendre pour le faire adopter et le faire appliquer par les \u00e9lus, dirigeants et gestionnaires gouvernementaux? Les leaders gouvernementaux actuels se sont enfonc\u00e9s dans ce que plusieurs d\u00e9crivent comme 'The Shadow', le c\u00f4t\u00e9 sombre du leadership. Il n'y a pas de baquette magique qui permette de leur toucher le front pour que leurs pens\u00e9es s'illuminent soudainement. Comment amener ces individus \u00e0 changer de mod\u00e8le? J'avoue que je p\u00e2lis \u00e0 cette perspective.\n\nJ'ai tent\u00e9 d'expliquer aux \u00e9lus et dirigeants gouvernementaux qu'il n'y a pas perte de pouvoir, mais plut\u00f4t un d\u00e9placement du pouvoir, une r\u00e9partition diff\u00e9rente du pouvoir, lorsqu'on passe du mod\u00e8le de leadership directif au mod\u00e8le de leadership participatif.\n\nIci, s'introduit la notion de souplesse, qui n'est pas non plus tr\u00e8s facile \u00e0 accepter, pour des gens habitu\u00e9s au contr\u00f4le.\n\n2) Le gouvernement ouvert, comme \u00e9tant une forme d'espoir, ce ne serait pas tellement compliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 expliquer et \u00e0 faire comprendre aux d\u00e9cideurs gouvernementaux et \u00e0 la population. Si l'on pr\u00e9sente le gouvernement ouvert comme \u00e9tant une philosophie, dont les principes s'appuient sur la transparence, la participation et la collaboration, la poursuite d'un id\u00e9al devient alors relativement simple \u00e0 saisir.\n\n3) Le libre acc\u00e8s aux donn\u00e9es cause g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le moins de remous et de r\u00e9sistance. Cela s'effectue habituellement dans une optique de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'information. Avant m\u00eame que les donn\u00e9es soient lib\u00e9r\u00e9es, la listes des donn\u00e9es non lib\u00e9rables est exig\u00e9e par les dirigeants gouvernementaux.\n\nLE R\u00d4LE DE LA PHILOSOPHIE\n\nNombreux sont celles et ceux qui se sont content\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent de commenter ce qui se fait dans le domaine du gouvernement ouvert, sans s'attarder sur CE QUI DEVRAIT \u00caTRE.\n\nCet \u00e9t\u00e9 (13 juin 2011), j'ai traduit en fran\u00e7ais un billet de Alberto Cottica sur mon blogue: <a href=\"http://govinthelab.com/a-people-not-a-target-group-why-advertising-thinking-can-damage-the-collaboration-between-people-and-government/\">A people, not a target group: why advertising thinking can damage the collaboration between people and government</a>\".

Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que \"l'open data (les donn\u00e9es ouvertes) est un \u00e9v\u00e9nement d'une ampleur comparable \u00e0 l'apparition de l'alphabet\".\n\nMagnifique d\u00e9claration, mais cela concerne l'open data, et non pas le gouvernement ouvert.\n\nDans l'espace francophone mondial, un seul pays francophone s'est dot\u00e9 d'une politique de gouvernement ouvert: le Canada.\n\nOr, comme D\u00e9mocratie en surveillance l'a soulign\u00e9 dans son rapport, le Canada a re\u00e7u une mauvaise note de 61% parce que \"<span>Presque toutes les lois n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 d'un syst\u00e8me de gouvernement efficace ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues au cadre juridique.

La d\u00e9claration de gouvernement ouvert au Canada ne signifie pas grand chose, dans les faits. Le Canada s'est joint \u00e0 l'Open Government Partnership, le 20 septembre 2011, mais n'a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de plan d'action.\n\nN'emp\u00eache que sur le territoire canadien, il y a la province de la Colombie-Britannique, qui a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 de nombreux efforts depuis que la premi\u00e8re ministre Christy Clark a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la province est un gouvernement ouvert. BC s'est dot\u00e9 d'une tr\u00e8s bonne \u00e9quipe, dont plusieurs membres ont encourag\u00e9 le projet Gouvernement ouvert et Francophonie. Peu ma\u00eetrisent l'usage de la langue fran\u00e7aise en Colombie-Britannique (les \u00e9changes concernant le gouvernement ouvert se sont tous d\u00e9roul\u00e9s en anglais), mais il y a eu un appui, il y a eu d\u00e9monstration de solidarit\u00e9, et des gestionnaires gouvernementaux m'ont dit qu'il souhaitaient vivement que la province du Qu\u00e9bec exerce un leadership dans ce domaine.\n\nCe qui n'est pas arriv\u00e9. Et je doute que cela se produise dans un avenir rapproch\u00e9.\n\nToujours au Canada, il s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 en octobre 2010, \u00e0 Edmonton, en Alberta, une conf\u00e9rence intitul\u00e9e \"<a href=\"http://beyond2010edmonton.com/\">Beyond Edmonton 2010</a>\", o\u00f9 quelques conf\u00e9renciers invit\u00e9s se sont pench\u00e9s sur le \"futur du gouvernement 2.0\".

It gives us the opportunity to do good communication, because we have a \"pulse\" to the project and plenty of ways to engage with it, online and offline in (so far) five countries in year 1 alone.\u00a0\n\nNow, I think, it is time to integrate a bit more. We need two things:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Documentation of offline stuff, so that offline workshops can be re-used to engage people online. This is not an option, but part of a legally binding contract\u00a0we have with\u00a0the Commission.

When you take a closer look at these people you realize how different the motivations of moving are, and\u00a0 depending on the motivation how different the goals and approaches are.\u00a0\n\nIf you decide to go into another country because you are interested in the culture you will most definitely integrate yourself and be open for the odds and difference you will come across. If you are forced to move though, for example because there is a war in your home country the situation is completely different.\u00a0\n\nSo on one hand we have the people who are moving maybe even because it looks good in your cv if you have lived in Stockholm for a while and then we have people who are forced to leave their countries for economic reasons or/and because its dangerous for them to stay.\n\nSo lets think about the people who are forced to leave their countries,\u00a0lets say they move to Germany. Maybe because they have heard of Germany somewhere but maybe even out of a coincidence because the help Organisation they first came across was German and then they where broad to Germany. If you think about coming into a country without even finding the culture interesting beforehand you can imagine that there are a lot of weird things and habits you will come across. Also from seeing the other culture you will change the view on your own culture. seeing the differences will make you understand your own culture from a new point of view. like for example if you see people eating with knife and fork and you usually eat with chopsticks thats a moment where you separate from the others and realize just what your culture is actually about.\u00a0\n\nThis I find very interesting these cultures in cultures. I feel like there might even be a completely new interpretation of your own country. I can only think about food examples right now, like if you go to a restaurant and get \u201etypical food\u201c and then you go to the country and they will never serve you that food, because its a new invention born out of a new interpretation from your own country and culture.\n\nWhat I find really interesting also is the second Generation. They are born in a society and raised by two probably completely different point of views. They inhabit two cultures, two languages, two patterns of behavior. I see it as a great advantage but also it must be super hard to find yourself between these two poles. So hard to make stuff \u201eright\u201c especially if right here and right there are the compete opposite.\n\nIf I think about my friends who are born in two cultures i have a deep respect for why they have already been through sometimes already in their childhood and what they are now. Its so amazing if you are able to understand two cultures and then maybe even distance yourself and analyze the differences. Take the pieces that you like most and combine them. Its definitely a creative task. Well thats maybe my naive way of seeing it because im not that much involved and even if i have been traveling a lot its very superficial and maybe far from really understanding something.\n\nWhat i\u00b4m asking myself is how to show what a great advantage the fusion of two culture can be. Not a clash of culture more a mergence. If you think about this in a really basic way a completely different point of view could probably open your eyes and make you creative.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Hacking and Making</strong>\n\nTo approach this task its important to firstly hack the habits of a culture.\n\nSeeing stuff through the eyes of someone else is a really good step. When i visited my grandma this weekend i broad an old friend with me. My grandparents house is something so familiar to me that i lost the ability to see how interesting they actually are and how much cultural value they have. My friends curiosity had a huge impact on me. We had a very close look at all the objects in the house and talked a lot to my grandma about the past.\u00a0\n\nI understood my own origin in different way. And saw my culture through the eyes of someone else.\n\nSO the questions that I'm asking myself are:\n\nHow can we show how great the merging of two cultures can be? fusion not clash of cultures\n\nHow can we overcome prejudice? or make use of prejudice?\n\nHow can we manifest respect and acceptance?\n\nHow can we be at eye level with one another ?\n\nHow can we make people look through the eyes of someone else?\n\nHow can we use the odds and peculiarities of a culture in a creative way?\n\nand probably a lot more to come..\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-12 14:22:22", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 07:35:37.857801", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 870, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4757, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4724, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>Structured as an open cross-functional network of people and ideas/concepts, the Education, Project and Theory Labs of <a href=\"http://ica.am/\">the Institute of Contemporary Art </a> provide a comprehensive set of resources, facilities and tools for understanding and operating in the contemporary art scene in Armenia and the wider global art contexts.</em>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/05e4d8acf2cb4f6b898fa4757b07d7688be7ebe4.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"457\"><br>\n\n<em>As a part of Education Lab, ICA's Critical and Curatorial Studies School offers the students an opportunity to get a hands-on/\u2019learn by doing\u2019 knowledge and experience in the main philosophical, political, critical and art theories.

Each of us doing more or less the same, based on individual skills, but we try to learn new skills and competences, and we also sometimes shift our responsibilities whenever any of us is busy. Nvard is a full-time employee at an IT company and Harut is a freelancer, who had also previously developed the website, whereas Nvard had authored the website design. They had learnt web development and graphic design to develop our website because we had limited resources to commission that work to other professionals. Our duties kind of depend on what we can do and our availability.\n\nOur organizational schedule and planning are short-termed since a long-term planning requires wider resources and funding that we currently don\u2019t have. It\u2019s also summertime so our school is on vacation so we organize ICA TALKS series that does not require bigger budgets like in case of exhibitions.\n\nBasically ICA consists of the school, the theoretical laboratory and the project lab.\n\nAt our courses we teach mostly theory of art and art criticism.We have our own point of view which in a way resulted in separation from the mainstream art movement in Armenia. This is the reason we are kind of isolated but we try to be open to the art scene so that all we have done, educating people could serve to the needs of arts in Armenia, to be able to apply their knowledge in the art scene in Armenia.\n\nWe got lots of activists in our network of graduates, who are involved in the political scene of Armenia(Teghut activists, Utopiana.am, Gyumri Biennale, etc).\n\nThe difference from CCA in Georgia, is that they have intensive international collaboration, whereas the collaboration of ICA with its international network was in a way suspended in recent 3 years, due to internal issues we needed to address in order to maintain the activities of the newly founded organization.\n\nOur Critical and Curatorial Studies program started in 2008 with a 6-month-long experimental class. Meanwhile, our International Summer Seminars for Curators in Yerevan were already being organized since 2006 (the most recent, 7th Edition took place in 2013). Then we organized a 1-year program in 2009-2010. The program transformed into a 2-year program in 2011-2013.\n\nAssociation of Art Critics of Armenia in 2006 became a member of <a href=\"http://www.aicainternational.org/\">AICA</a> which founded ICA in Yerevan. In 2012 ICA was founded on the basis of the curators and art critics. The school is one of the programs of AICA. In 2013 we were registered as a foundation and our first course started.\n\n<a href=\"http://ica.am/VanEghyan_ThePlaceofArt.php\">Van Eghyan </a>- a 1960s modernist artist from Yeghegndzor who was one of the most remarkable figures in intellectual circles of the province and educated several generations of artists through his teaching activities at local art school - to create a Memorial Museum and a project lab to revive the arts scene in Eghegnadzor. Fund-raise the money to construct the museum building next to the artist\u2019s house. We also want to initiate an architectural contest for the construction of Van Yeghyan Memorial Museum.\n\nTranslation as a community-building practice project centered around the translation of <a href=\"http://ica.am/LeMaitreIgnorant.php\">Ignorant Schoolmaster</a> by Jacques Ranciere from French into Armenian, but the community-building didn\u2019t reach it goal in terms of forming a common agenda and working towards achieving it. The aim was to gather around 1000 people around the project and to work together as a community but there were only 30 people in the end. The book was translated by the son of Revolutionary activist and poet <a href=\"http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Azat+Vshtuni\">Azat Vshtuni</a>, Armen Vshtuni, who is currently homeless but who used to be one of the key influential figures in the beaumonde of Soviet intelligentsia in the 1960s. After receiving an advance the former dandy, who freely speaks English and French, disappeared. A couple years later he contacted me again to start the work. It took him around 1 year and 4 months to translate the manuscript. I\u2019m editing it now. After editing the book will be printed just to give it to the 30 people who were involved.\n\nWe are currently working on a new project- Community Art Festival in Tavush region, also including a community art seminar in Dilijan and mapping of regional arts and cultural CSOs and independent initiatives.This was first organized as a diploma work of \u201810 graduates of our school in Ijevan, Tavush.\n\nIn Nubarashen district in Yerevan we are working on the creation of Poghos Nubar Contemporary Art Center for the revival of socially, ecologically and culturally deprived suburban (11th) district of Yerevan.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/599d0c98f76e78a66c663cd46cf44ac9ead87ce1.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\n<strong>Hypothesis guiding the work: \"I believe that to achieve x, we need to do y, through z\"</strong>\n\n\"We believe that to achieve creative freedom we need to decentralize culture through education and community art practices.\"\n\n<strong>What your main objectives are/why you do this?</strong>\n\n\"Our main objective is to support the development of creative freedom in Armenia through cultural decentralization, alternative sustainability models and contribution to local and global contemporary art discourses. To achieve that we focus on education in critical and curatorial studies, job of exhibition, community art and civic engagement initiatives as well as writing, translation and publishing of critical literature.\"\n\n<strong>What you enjoy about the work and what you enjoy less?</strong>\n\n\"We enjoy the freedom and horizontality of our work process but this also means precarious funding, limited resources, capacities and lack of long-term programming.\n\nWe multitask a lot and it is very hard to find qualified specialists who could help us in our routine. Nobody really is willing to volunteer for an art institution in Armenia as they prefer having paid internships that would secure a paid position afterwards or they prefer to pursue their studies abroad.\"\n\n<strong>What kinds of tasks do you do on a regular basis? Yearly, monthly, weekly, daily</strong>\n\n\"Every day we maintain our institution and residency cluster, work on our project that are on different levels - from pre-production to dissemination of results, follow and make summary of recent events and occurrences n local and global public sphere that can affect or redefine our development strategies and tactics.  We host talks, presentations, lectures, discussions and community events on a weekly and monthly basis. Every year, usually in October-June we have our educational program with lectures, seminars, research projects running. Also, we try to support our students with their diploma and final exhibition projects but considering our limited resources it\u2019s a challenge we need to address most of the time.\"\n\n<strong>What, other than money, do you think could help you in your work?</strong>\n\n\"First and foremost, human resources(especially expertise in fundraising), a more sustainable communication, networking and collaboration with local and international artists and initiatives.\"\n\n<strong>What help could you offer others and under which conditions (assuming no money is involved)?</strong>\n\n\"We have space and facilities that we can provide to artists, curators, critics, arts and cultural managers and interdisciplinary researchers for networking, work and events. We can also provide consulting and assistance in project development, production, post-production and dissemination of results as well as matchmaking. \"\n\n<strong>How do you go about doing this- what steps are involved? Technologies or processes used?</strong>\n\n\"Most of the time we apply the \u2018learn by doing\u2019 approach assuming that everyone can teach something and everyone can learn something new every day. We also strive to keep up the changing digital technologies and platforms that can optimize our work routine, e.g. we use Asana and Trello for task and project management through Kanban system whenever there\u2019s more time for planning and consideration. But we\u2019re also quite flexible and do things spontaneously, e.g. when there\u2019s an interesting art professional in Yerevan whose practice corresponds to our vision, we might invite her/him for a talk or a more considerate collaboration like a screening program, series of lectures, seminars or an exhibition.\"\n\n<strong>Costs: What expenses are involved? Who benefits from the work? Who currently supports it, how and why?</strong>\n\n\"Most of our main activities are currently not supported by third parties, except for the education program (student tuition) and commissioned projects publishing (from research and writing to translation, editing, proofreading, publishing, exhibitions etc.). Our main target groups include youth, art professionals, underrepresented identities, social groups and local communities. Stakeholders also include media, CSOs, suburban and rural communities, our local and international networks and partners as well as the Ministries of Culture, Tourism, Youth, local and municipal governments. The main beneficiary, indeed is the wider society.\"\n\n<strong>Existing alternatives: Who else is doing similar or relevant work/offering similar things- locally and or elsewhere?</strong>\n\n\"There are several independent and third-sector initiatives and organizations carrying out networking, residency and representation activities in the field of contemporary art such as Suburb Cultural Center (Eva Khachatryan), Arts and Cultural Studies Laboratory/Art Commune AIR Cluster (Susanna Gyulamiryan), ACOSS residency (Mkrtich Tonoyan), education, publishing and presentation activities like MEDIALAB/Utopiana.am (Vahe Budumyan, Nora Galfayan), AJZ artist-run space (Nvard Yerkanian, Harutyun Alpetyan) that organizes exhibitions, screenings, talks, presentations, discussions and networking, Inknagir Literary Magazine and Club (Violet Grigoryan, Vahan Ishkhanyan) that provides platform form contemporary literature and emerging writers, organizes presentations, events, readings and discussions, publishes translations of critical writers and philosophers. Another new organization is Ashot Johannesian Institute for Human Sciences (Vardan Azatyan, Angela Harutyunyan) that focuses on translation of dissertations by turn-of-the-century Armenian researchers, conducts translation and independent research in the field of critical, cultural studies and contemporary philosophy. I\u2019m not mentioning artistic collectives and groups here because our activities fall into the scope of research, production and dissemination of critical thought and curatorial practice not art production per se.\"\n\n<strong>Important players affecting the work? (locally and internationally) </strong>\n\n\u201cThe main players include our local and international partners and networks(Gyumri Biennale, Art Lab, Urban Lab, Inqnagir magazine, Save Teghut civic initiative, etc), corresponding authorities and government bodies, as well as international, mainly European diplomatic agencies and the Eastern Partnership Culture Program.\u201c\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7d074d8ba8b7a3b35858652d141c17bbd6734fd9.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"458\"><br>\n\n<strong>Long term perspective: any Business or sustainability plan?  </strong>\n\n\u201cWe are planning to combine local and international funding, membership, commissioning, donation, crowdfunding (for initiatives that fall out of the funding policies and priorities) and social entrepreneurship  schemes to continue our activities on a more consistent and large-scale basis.\u201d\n\n<strong>Regulation and policy affecting this?</strong>\n\n\u201cOn the local level its first and foremost the lack of a cultural policy that up till now the government of RA has failed to adopt. This results in centralization, limited transparency, lack of public accountancy and access to decision-making by the third sector in respect to state funds allocation in the field of culture. Lack of considerate vision and actions in respect to the development of creative economy results in poor development of contemporary art market and circulation of capital that would support production and dissemination of contemporary art and critical thought, foster participation of contemporary art from Armenia in key art fairs and festivals abroad, the development of local and regional fairs, festivals, auctions, incentives that would trigger the private sector to expand it\u2019s public promotion priorities from focusing mainly on social charity to opening up also for contemporary art. Tax incentives would trigger emergence of new galleries and art centers, thus resulting in job growth for educated art professionals, especially in the suburbs of capital Yerevan and in provinces of Armenia, contributing to diversity of cultural expression. \u201c\n\n<strong>What do you believe are the most important projects locally that are relevant to the work you are doing at this moment?</strong>\n\n\u201cWell, the most important are the educational programs, discussions and debates that deal with topical issues in our society, from human rights to urban spaces, ecology, gender and feminist studies, media studies, rule of law, fair administration and freedom of expression. There is a considerate number of such initiatives that support the emancipation of public sphere that is the most important challenge a country like ours should address efficiently.\u201d\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<div> </div>", "created_at": "2015-08-03 00:35:31", "updated_at": "2019-01-29 09:49:31.304160", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2497, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 382.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6321, "user_id": 3638, "topic_id": 6288, "post_number": 1, "raw": "After our first initiative we are really enthusiastic for our future endeavors as we participated in a workshop based on \u201cTheater for Differently Able\u201d which is funded by British Council Bangladesh along with an expert from U.K, Jeany Sealy  who herself is a deaf and also one of the organizers of London Paralympics. We are hopeful as the entire project is entitled \u201cA different Shakespeare\u201d, and all the actors and actresses are differently able, being deaf or physically immovable. It was neither a barrier nor limitation from being in performing arts in terms of being deaf and wheel chair users, losing any part of limbs but at the end being able to express in the way you are and this time the maximum participants were selected from BRIDGE foundation.\n\nWe finished a boot camp based on \u2018From Sign Language to C++\u201d based on Programming for Differently Able and especially for deaf   and the targeted group was around 14-18 with the help of two young, enthusiastic undergrads who worked as trainer on voluntary basis. BRIDGE foundation itself is consisted with all the youth volunteers and state department alumnus who are spirited for the community betterment; community based services, youth and civic engagement as well as future leaders of Green Earth campaign.\n\nIn 2015 December we ,the BRIDGE Foundation initiated the project \u201cARTPreneur for Differently Able Young Deaf Artists\u201d where they do have opportunities to work under the experts through monthly basis workshop and selling their art work through online as well. In this first initiative \u201cAlliance Fran\u00e7oise\u201d supported us along with their in house artists and also CounterFoto supported us along with their venue where famous artist \u201cNajib Tareque\u201d came as guest lecturer and we do believe that they are the \u201cDifferently Able\u201d and this a terminology that brings the positive vibe and disability is at the end all about our mind set and exclusion free society is important through more engagement and employment.\n\nWe successfully ended our  year along with participation in\u201d Social Enterprise Day\u201d,29 th December 2015 powered by British Council and facilitated by \u201c Better Stories\u201d at their official venue.\n\nThe special cases of physically disable students who are less in number as we expected that we would also be able to accommodate the wheel chair users along with ramp but at the end they could not make it due to support from their parents and distance, where we found we would have special session along with the guardian and parents also. Female Participation is required to be increased through consultation and motivation to find out their feasibility and access in future.\n\nLast but not least we do urge to every activist and volunteer to support us being actively engaged as a volunteer through BRIDGE Foundation and work for the excluded group through sharing, teaching and capacity building being a facilitator for each and every differently able to be touched through voice, through your eyes, your touchy fingers, extended and helping hands and valuable time at the end. Mainstream has been done, has been doing and will be doing but what about excluded, scheduled and out stream people? if we don\u2019t listen to voice of silence, to make the immovable a movable one through IT, technology and information which can lessen the gap of \u201cDigital Divide\u2019 and can ensure \u201cDifferently Able in Development \u201cwith a positive notion instead of \u201cDisable in Development\u201d the Sustainable and inclusive development will be a myth only. At the end<strong> I do believe you are not disabled unless you believe that </strong>and I am hopeful that the government initiated the strategies of inclusion for the \u201cDifferently Able\u201d even though that are in the limited era but this is the beginning. One day there will be no separate school in the name of special education, and both the parents and teachers would be cooperative to include them and mainstream institutions, organizations and corporations will come forward to engage them and believe in their potentiality. Our team and BRIDGE foundation is proud to be with those who are associated with our initiative being special in terms of endeavor from the mainstream a long and lonely journey to go before we reach towards the goal along with individual efforts.\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/theajalaproject/photos/a.307880219338955.1073741828.307875172672793/1055182401275396/?type=3&amp;theater](https://www.facebook.com/theajalaproject/photos/a.307880219338955.1073741828.307875172672793/1055182401275396/?type=3&amp;theater)\n\n[http://worldmerit.org/merit360.aspx/](https://worldmerit.org/merit360/) Agent of Change 2016\n\n[natasha kabir bangladeshi contributing worldwide](http://thebangladeshtoday.com/2016/03/natasha-kabir-bangladeshi-contributing-worldwide-2/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr5JiMN48RU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr5JiMN48RU)\n\nhttps://audioboom.com/boos/3569768-training-for-differently-abled-students-in-bangladesh\n\nhttp://www.britishcouncil.org.bd/en/events/diversity-week-2016\n\n[Proceeding of ICTL 2016Final.pdf](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VHzlU_C5ptRI5FyBvUNZrh-xGgEBMU-a)\n\nSeptember1, 2016 as Conference proceeding, Centre for Pedagogy, Independent University of Bangladesh,April22-23 2016, Publication title Socio-Cultural Economics Interlinked with the Differently Able in\n\nSouth Asia: From the Case Study of Inclusive Model of Creating Deaf Creative Sector Based Workers through Skill Based Trainingin Bangladesh [Working Paper]\n\n[Questionnaire on \u201cdisability-inclusive policies\u201d - Call for submissions](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Disability/SRDisabilities/Pages/disability-inclusivepolicies.aspx)\n\nfile_fid:17664 - Project Name: Empowering the Ability of Differently Able Partner Organizations: BPKS, World Hearing Concern, Dhaka Deaf High Sch", "created_at": "2017-05-13 00:11:03", "updated_at": "2018-04-24 16:37:57.545127", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 906, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 30.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 578, "user_id": 3279, "topic_id": 545, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0In our previous post, we concluded that nobody had really ideated SoundSight all alone\u2026 no solitary genius working on an ingenious solution, no hero. A collision of honest and upfront conversations about existential experiences and a research of numerous solutions that had yet to be exploited in a certain context, rethinking their business models.\n\nAt this point, SoundSight was a completely new initiative. A virtual gym to train echolocation, and while the idea of features and UX design accumulated quickly, the team pursued a proof-of-concept and something that others could think of as a minimum viable product.\n\nThe first prototype was a mess. To the users invited to a test, it must have seemed unbelievable how a software engineer could have thought that a piece of software reverberating in a fixed environment and artificial sound would have been enough to suggest how the platform would work. Not to mention, a command line interface, and a rather lengthy procedure to change the position within the simulated environment. But thanks to the outgoing and always positive outlook of Irene, they never thought of disinvesting: SoundSight was an experience for them.\n\nThe team worked hectically on Irene\u2019s feedbacks, and a really workable proof-of-concept finally became available around Spring 2015.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s leave it again to Irene\u2019s recollection:\n\nIrene: \u201cHello Mario<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>, we are here again\u2026 this time I promise you will be impressed\u201d\n\nMario: \u201cHi Irene, it\u2019s a pleasure\u2026 and rest assured, last time I was already impressed, although maybe not as you hoped for\u2026 with my friends we have been laughing a lot about your engineer\u2019s idea of a prototype!\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cOh no, Mario\u2026 don\u2019t abuse him, or who knows when we will find another person with the same talent and will to do something meaningful even with no immediate profit in sight! I am counting on you to keep certain things\u201d\n\nMario: \u201cDon\u2019t worry Irene, I have only told the story to one or two\u2026 hundreds of people\u2026 ahahah!\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cDoh! \u2026ok Mario, then to pay you back, today\u2019s text will be extra tough!\u201d\n\nMario: \u201cI am ready for the challenge!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIrene sets up the simulation\n\n\u00a0\n\nIrene: \u201cOK Mario, it\u2019s ready. I would like to ask you to try the first round without me sharing with you any information\u2026 I want you to focus on your impressions only, tell me how it feels\u201d\n\nMario: \u201clet\u2019s start\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe simulation is run, Mario is moved to several places in a cathedral in this virtual world, and listens to the echoes of a tongue click\n\n\u00a0\n\nMario: \u201cIndeed there have been a lot of improvements, it is smooth now\u2026 last time it was a bit of an annoyance to have to wait for so long every time you wanted to move the position. However, listening to a prerecorded tongue click\u2026 are you sure these are simulations?\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cYes Mario\u2026 we know it still requires a bit of imagination, but I assure you this is a real time simulation. Later during the tests, I will offer you the possibility to move the position arbitrarily, and you should notice it. It is definitely on our list of priorities to introduce real-time input of user generated tongue clicks\u2026 we are just not there yet\u2026 you are one of our very early testers, and I cannot thank you enough for that\u201d\n\nMario: \u201cDon\u2019t, I enjoy this experience, and I really like the concept. Somehow contributing to its realization makes me proud. However, you need my honest opinions, and I think the ability to exploit the user\u2019s own tongue click will improve the experience terrifically. I have realized that you have made me move through wide and small environments\u2026 but I haven\u2019t been able to identify where I was.\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cThat\u2019s already quite good Mario! I have only given you one point for each environment, and you have already been able to tell something about them\u2026 you are the best! We will focus on learning curves and performances later again, can you tell me anything else about your general impressions at the moment?\u201d\n\nMario: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell you more from just this\u2026 maybe we can move to the next exercise?\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cYes, here we go. Get ready, and now I will let you walk through the environment of today, and you will hear repeated clicks\u2026 try to guess what it would be\u201d\n\nJust a quick run of the new scenario on the simulator\n\nMario: \u201chmmm\u2026 the smoothness has improved a lot\u2026 but I really could not tell you what it is. It seems a large environment, I have been getting away from a wall and after getting closer to another?\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cI had told you would not have an easy life, after those jokes about our engineer Mario! But you did quite well. It was a cathedral\u2026 now that I have told you, could you confirm it or would you still be doubtful?\u201d\n\nMario: \u201cLet me try to listen again\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2026the simulator runs again shortly\n\nMario: \u201cYes Irene, now that I know, it could well be\u2026 I had some doubts, with no context it could have been a theater or a large gym, \u2026\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cIndeed\u2026 now I would like you to do a few exercises\u2026 I will tell you this time what you are going to listen to, precisely, and you will have to focus on the features\u2026 later there will be a test\u2026\u201d\n\nMario: \u201cFor me or for the software?\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cFor both, Mario, don\u2019t try to escape your responsibilities\u201d\n\nMario: \u201cAhahah\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey run the training set\n\nMario: \u201cWell Irene, we will see how I perform later\u2026 but you should consider developing an interface to feed information about structures, volumes, and positions, directly to your users\u2026 it is nice to chat with you, but if you really think of this as a tool for making echolocation training accessible to anyone, the fact that you need to have by your side another person as your interface to the system doesn\u2019t add up\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cYou are right. Together with the real-time acquisition of users\u2019 clicks, this interface is at the top of our list of priorities. We are thinking of using a simple tablet of mechanically executed needles to offer a map of the space being tested and a natural interface\u2026 or some haptic 3D interface, but that may be more expensive and complicated. We have not yet looked into that enough\u201d\n\nMario: \u201cYou would need a lot of needles to offer a useful interface\u2026 you can try prototyping something quick maybe with Arduino\u2026 but I would be a lot more curious about the haptic interface. I have seen some applications with holograms and they looked impressive.\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cWe will keep this in mind. Of course, we need to make it as simple and cheap as possible, but still functional\u2026 and we hope the prices of that hardware will be democratized soon. Now that we have taken a small break\u2026\u201d\n\nMario: \u201cWhat break? Are you not letting me off yet?\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cMario, let\u2019s just take the test before the coffee\u2026 I will let you off then, for today\u201d\n\nMario: \u201cOk, ok\u2026 a no is not possible anyway, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cIt\u2019s always possible, but I will insist with a smile\u201d\n\nThey run the tests\n\nIrene: \u201dif we compare today\u2019s performances to those from the last tests, both with the software and in the lab with the moving panels, you have really gotten better Mario!\u201d\n\nMario: \u201cBut Irene, how can I be sure if I have truly learned? I mean\u2026 we should arrange tests where there are coupled with some sort of benchmark\u2026 maybe similar tests in real world, you could imagine a mobile lab to do so\u2026 or even just arrange competitions among users\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cThat\u2019s a really good idea, Mario! We will seriously reflect on how to arrange this, but for the time being\u2026 do you think your partner would like to try it out against you?\u201d\n\nMario: \u201cBut she sees\u2026\u201d\n\nIrene: \u201cit should not be an advantage, and I promise you I will not show her the screen\u201d\n\nThis is now a different story\u2026 but after being initially baffled, Mario\u2019s partner took it to her heart to seriously compete with him, and in the end, she won one of the tests, confirming <strong>anyone can learn this skill</strong>.\n\n<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">1</a>\u00a0Please be reminded that Mario is a blind guy.

Basically this, our own tagging plugin for Annotator, <a href=\"https://github.com/albertjuhe/annotator_view\">annotator_view</a> and search integration, and we have the basic Open Ethnographer thing together.\n\nAnd yes right, one can configure which element Annotator should start from. But it only affects where an annotator button will be shown when selecting text. The annotation will still get stored with the full XPath starting from the document root. For example, in my case Annotator is configured to only allow annotations for the <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">.node</code> element and below, but a path stored with that setting is <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">/div[1]/div[3]/div[1]/div[1]/p[1]</code>. Changing anything about the node template would break it. Or anything about the URL, since it does not (yet) use the Drupal canonical URLs (<code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">/node/id</code>). So yes, we need to rework it \u2026\n\nSince annotation ranges are simply stored with XPath expressions, the simplest thing would be to use those adapted for word IDs (<code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">//span[@id='w-7x64shgw'</code>) or, if we don't want that, at least those starting from the content elememts' enclosing tag. These are already nicely marked by Drupal, so we can use for example <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">//*[@id='node-2345']/p[3]</code> or <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">//*[@id='comment-12345']/p[3]</code>. Should work, but I have to test still \u2026 . And, it would still be a hack. The clean solution is adding \"entity type\" (node, comment etc.) and \"entity ID\" columns to the annotation database table. Annotator would get these IDs from the HTML IDs shown above though \u2013 I think there's no other way.\n\nAnother aspect of the reworking is to store tags, which is possible with <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2224889\">some patches</a> apparently. For marking annotations as public (\"shared\") or private, we should look to the Authentication and Permissions plugins of Annotator. Or maybe not, as the public / private info should concern whole tags / codes, not individual annotations.\n\nI have rethought the word ID tagging. Storing annotations as (word ID, tag ID) tuples would work, but creates some problems: Annotator will expect connecting subsequent words that are annotated with the same tag into the same annotation. The same for search result snippets in the quotation manager. Also, the storage would more be like (word ID, tag ID, user ID, created date), so contain quite some redundant stuff that is be shared by several annotated words the way Annotator stores it now. So: we could keep with how Annotator does it now (with the above XPath related changes). And then later, when wanting to make Open Ethnographer change resistant, store the annotated text as both a string (like Annotator does now) and a list of word IDs (in addition). Then, have a function hooking into node saving that adapts all annotations on the node based on the word IDs stored with the annotation. Since we use word IDs only to reposition an annotation, making them an optional add-on, we have some chance to get this added to the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/annotation\">annotation</a> Drupal module.\n\nAnnotations on changing content is a major unsolved issue for Annotator (see <a href=\"https://github.com/openannotation/annotator/issues/115\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/hypothesis/h/wiki/robust-anchors\">here</a>), and they intend to solve it with heuristic repositioning and manual confirmation. Open Ethnographer has the advantage that we can control the text and add word IDs, allowing for a deterministic solution. But as said, we can develop it lateron with this new proposal.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-08 02:15:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:04.563073", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 646, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7910], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1061, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 1028, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2>\n\n<strong>To attend: <a href=\"http://codesign-unmonastery.eventbrite.com/\">http://codesign-unmonastery.eventbrite.com/</a></strong>\n\n<span>This event is intended to contribute to and build on what unMonastery will become in the spirit by which it came into being during the first\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bridgetmckenz/sets/72157630272695776/with/7436162332/\" style=\"color: rgb(15, 144, 186); text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">EdgeRyders unconference</a>.

This extends from food and clothing to socializing in the clubroom of the Centre. It is also open to local and foreign collectivities, such as theatrical groups or other alternative schemes that can\u2019t afford much money to rent a place in order to operate. And is accessed by both Greeks and immigrants (especially children) who lack educational opportunities.\n\nIt was established in 2004 on the initiative of Antiracist Initiative of Thessaloniki and since 2009 it is housed in a historic area of the city center. Beyond the Antiracist Initiative, its 3 floors currently house approximately 20 movements, labor, migration and social collectives, assemblies and other initiatives, like theatrical and cultural groups.\n\nInitiatives of the Migrants Social Centre also include voluntary actions of practical solidarity groups such as \u201cOut of the Classroom\u201d that offers free courses in Greeks and immigrants (Greek and foreign language lessons, additional teaching to Junior High School and High School students). It also runs:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\ta Solidarity Kitchen that offers meal and companionship to hundreds of people every weekend.</li>\n\n<li>\tRoom39 that gathers and distributes relief items and food to refugees and homeless.</li>\n\n<li>\tA Legal Support Group for refugees and immigrants and many other temporary or permanent activities.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOther collectivities that reside independently in the Migrants Social Centre are Indigenous People of Biafra, the Network for Unemployed and Precarious Workers, the Network for Political and Social Rights, Ethical, Technological &amp; Idealistic Association the Theatrical and Tango Group of Immigrants\u2019 Place, and much more.\n\nWe are reaching out to citizens and other local organizations through a<a href=\"http://socialcenter.espivblogs.net/\"> dedicated website</a> and our<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/socialcenterthess/?hc_ref=SEARCH\"> Facebook page</a>, which includes all information that needs to be transferred to people in need. Additionally, we keep cooperating with collectivities all over the city and not only with these that are housed in the Migrants Social Centre, like the local social solidarity clinic.\n\nIn the Solidarity Kitchen, people who currently offer their services come from those who initially asked to have access to lunch on weekends. Also, we would like to highlight the contribution of Room 39\u2019s members, who deliver meals to homeless people all over the city center on bikes. It is the only initiative in Thessaloniki that serves food directly to the public spots where homeless people live every night.\n\nIt is a completely self-organised place, depending exclusively on volunteers\u2019 work and all of us who participate in it. Financially, the Social Centre is solely supported by donations of the participating groups and the profits of the clubroom.\n\nToday, the Migrants Social Centre faces many financial challenges, putting at risk its continuity and operations.\n\nOur Refugee Hostel was for years the only hosting structure for immigrants in Thessaloniki, offering free accommodation to 70 adults and children. When the Public Electricity Company cut the power in the hostel due to high debt, we reconnected the supply to our name. The existing debt will stop all activities and solidarity action housed and supported by the Centre. This includes the solidarity courses for locals and immigrants, the kitchen, the collection and distribution of relief items. Therefore, we address solidarity collectives in Greece and abroad, asking for contributions to repay this debt.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-18 18:09:59", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 13:51:30.400712", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 667, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 121.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15459, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1362, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>This is just..</b>\n\nHi Chris, hi Pete,\n\nI just have to say, this is awesome!

I don't actually think the distinction between practical and theoretical is always so clear cut, in the sense that whilst action should always take priority over mere reflection, both are, in my view, inseparable parts of an effective strategy. What I am trying to get at is that one can perhaps propose two main ways people have tried to change their worlds - <em>prefigurative</em> (i.e. practically prefiguring a future society as they would like to see it, small scale, localised, direct-action orientated - the 'temporary autonomous zone' type thing) and <em>critical</em> (i.e. often something that often appears more 'theoretical', but that does not make a positive proposition, rather it is about finding and deconstructing the operations and contradictions of what already exists, and tends towards a macro-level examination of wider society and its functions). As I said above, I believe that both are necessary and intertwined, but observing that the majority of sessions tend towards the former, prefigurative approach, I think some rebalancing towards a broader critique, suggesting ways these examples might connect up into a larger strategy might be useful. This is what I hope to bring. But nevertheless, don't worry too much about a lack of examples above, I hope to introduce examples in terms of the 5 points, and also hopefully make clearer the general framing in terms of 'social reproduction' I was talking about. Sorry if that is not clear above, I was trying not to overload the description with detail whilst still including everything I hoped to cover (which is quite a lot, but if its too much, I am sure I can focus on bits people are most interested in).\n\nIf you want a concrete example of people engaging with some of the above ideas, perhaps this could be somewhere to start:\u00a0<a href=\"http://eipcp.net/transversal/0704/precarias1/en\">http://eipcp.net/transversal/0704/precarias1/en</a> This feminist collective from Spain is one example I hope to talk about. They set out to use a method taken from 'psychogeography' - the derive, or drift - to understand the manifestations of social reproduction in their city, the relation of the space to the work of caring, and discovering points of commonality.\n\nAnother example is a group that I have been involved with in London, The New Cross Commoners. They/we have been exploring our neighbourhood, finding common resources and techniques, producing people's kitchens and understanding the localised terrain of 'reproduction' as a way exploring a wider societal critique through the idea of the commons. A publication introducing some of these ideas can be found here: \u00a0<a href=\"http://newxcommoners.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/nxcpublication_2013.pdf\">http://newxcommoners.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/nxcpublication_2013.pdf</a> (the glossary on pg.55 might be particularly useful).\n\nPerhaps one more useful point of reference, at least on some of the terms I have used, could be found here, on the site of another UK-based group - particularly the entries on <a href=\"http://www.weareplanc.org/blog/glossary/#reproduction\">r</a>eproduction and the dual character of reproduction:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.weareplanc.org/blog/glossary/\">http://www.weareplanc.org/blog/glossary/</a> The definitions are somewhat opaque, but might be helpful for some people, I'll try to articulate this in a more accessible way in the workshop. It might seem somewhat abstract, but I believe it is a very useful and important abstraction to understand, in terms of how localised examples of stewardship could fit into a meta analysis.\n\nLastly, for anyone unfamiliar with psychogeography, wikipedia is as good a place to start as any:\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography</a>\n\nCheers, C\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-03 08:51:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:50.077960", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 656, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25100, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4625, "post_number": 7, "raw": "I think we agree on too many things to discuss them all in a lifetime. :)\n\nRe dark: I can't say (as in: I am not capable) what they are exactly.

Time for Vanaprastha. Time to get off the racket of the world. Time to switch off.\n\nWhy? I've worked enough. I've done a lot of things. Began writing at 5. I continue to write. Never could publish because publishing poetry does not count in this world. Plato was right. Somewhere I read that he said \"If you meet a poet entering your city, garland him, feed him some good food, send him on his way. Be nice to him but don't really bother about him.\"\n\nSo too with my short stories.\u00a0\n\nPeople read my writing and say \"Hey, man, get it published.\" Should I rub shoulders with the cocktail circuit people who actually use their networks and connections and power to DECIDE what really SELLS? The thought of it sickens me. I've talked to people. But you gotta be cool and with it and belong to a certain class and lick the right boots in some subtle manner to really get published. I've seen this happening in a lot of other spheres too. The way networks are built follow the ancient feudal patterns of heirarchy, respect, the pecking order and at the end of it \"He who pays the piper calls the tune\". I am yet to meet someone who might bother to enable publication of my poetry or short stories. Apparently, I am not \"well-connected\" enough.\u00a0\n\nAlright, so I was in journalism for 20 years writing on everything but especially art and culture for leading Indian English newspapers. I taught a lot of Mass Communication, Mass Media and Journalism too on the side. Then I left journalism (people said my writing was good) to teach in an art and design school. They said I was a great teacher. Twelve years of teaching and then I move again. This time I am in the biggest design firm in India. Trying to figure out my role in this place.\n\nWhat am I to do with my varied life, the knowledge that explodes inside my head, the despair over the route the world is taking. Somewhere in between (now I know this is really politically incorrect these days) I had an authentic encounter with the Resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. I began working for Him. Moved through a variety of Christian groups including a Norway-based cult that believes it is possible for human beings to become sinless. Interesting times. Some 20 years of \"ministry\" too and you see what is happening in Christendom. Another reason to despair. The same human difficulties are there everywhere. I haven't lost my faith or His Presence but things fox me nowadays.\n\nIs there no solution to the human condition except work work and more work? In a world where the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. The Earth is dying, I feel it in my bones. Why seek to sustain what is dying? The birth-work-earn-procreate-death wheel has been turning a long time and is now technology powered. They say the Noosphere is being created. A world mind. I am not sure what kind of mind this will be. More tyrannical than what exists in all its subtlety? When I was young I sensed the disatisfaction with the way the globe was turning. Now young people are once again out there to Occupy Wall Street. The wheel keeps spinning.\n\nThere is only one question left for me to resolve. How to escape the wheel?\n\nThe answers are spiritual. The earth needs spiritual people. How does one take up this work?\n\nTired of working to renew the world's resources and solve problems, one must turn inwards and Godwards. Find the secret Jesus had. Fulfill it in oneself.\u00a0\n\nHe never worked to get a paycheck. He had wisdom. Embodiment of certain values that have disappeared almost entirely.\n\nWell, they say it is a New Age. I may yet see what the New Age brings. But perhaps I would prefer to turn elsewhere.\n\nThat's the edge.\n\nThe turning away.\n\nTo discover afresh the values Christ proposed and embody them.\n\nIt is a razor's edge and politically incorrect because one knows one cannot live by Bible-belt logic or Armageddon scenarios.\n\nIt is within and if it multiplies within, perhaps something will go out of me to heal people and the world.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2011-10-20 04:32:31", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 11:32:40.712525", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 781, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16403, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3811, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Done</b>\n\nDid not work, but we tried.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-29 08:47:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:31.946486", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14238, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6221, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>What happens in practice? </b>\n\nWhich activities do you envision?

In this text our projects and concepts are be more clear. mariam.\n\n<span>On the streets, bridges, blank walls. In strange cities, forgotten stations, absurd buildings, ghost bathhouses, white cubes, abandoned shooting ranges, non \u2013 existing factories. Anywhere: We play a game. Forbidden, magic and ephemeral game. Something to change all.</span>\n\n<span>Our concepts are inspired by stories and biographies of places and people.</span>\n\n<span>With interventions in different contexts with our works we\u00a0 emphasise biography, past and present of places.</span>\n\n<span>We are interested in disappearing knowledge, invisible people, forgotten places, ignored spaces. With our works we create new language, mythology to derive new meanings and new visions, to restore memories, remember what is gone, create future.</span>\n\n<span>Since 2011 Im working in collaboration with Detu Jintcharadze. We work in two directions - text based art - interventions in public spaces and ghost museums - site specific installations inspired with different stories, knowledge and mythology.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Project <b>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol :</b></span>\n\n<span>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is language of forgotten, abandoned places. Places which are not on the map any more.</span>\n\n<span>Texts are \u201cready \u2013 made \u201c messages from internet, social media, different programs or websites.</span>\n\n<span>Bringing message to different context re-creates its initial meaning and transforms the text into content that is multiple and flexible, subjective and personal.</span>\n\n<span>It can be a question from another, simulated reality.</span>\n\n<span>It can be a warning in safe zone, leaked from invisible worlds.</span>\n\n<span>It can be a note from future memories.</span>\n\n<span>Project <b>Homework</b>:\n\nHomework is a series of word \u201cpaintings\u201d; each word functions as a symbol that represents a concept. The meaning of the word-symbol depends on viewers and the context it is presented in.\u00a0 Perception of the word is subjective and depends on each person\u2019s individual association with the word.\u00a0 Thus \u201cHomework\u201d plays with public\u2019s consciousness, its ideas and associations. Remembering forgotten meanings and words.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>For me personally our works are conversation with society, attempt to start critical dialogue, some times our texts are reactions, sometimes predictions.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Street art or art in public space - I'm always for art without bureaucracy and without permissions. Im always for art under the sky - not under the roof of galleries or museums. Im for art which can change, which can question and provoke.</span>\n\n<span>25 000 000 project - this was a reaction, a question. Me and young artists Gvantsa Jishkariani mad this stencil in from of patriarchs residency on his birthday. This is a amount which church gets from government every year. Country where social and economical problems are severe government pays 25 million to organisation which is speaking with language of hate and threatens people with hell. Organisation which organised 17th may pogrom. We had problems with police and patriarchs security after this project. As the text was made on pavement - legally police couldn't fine us - but together with patriarch\u2019s security in police department they tried to threaten us so that we wouldn't ask any questions again.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Our works/projects are connected to soviet past and inevitability of rethinking this past for future development. As after fall of soviet union Georgia never had time to think and plan future - most of political and social processes are based on emotional, impulsive decisions. In such environment development is impossible. Soviet ideology is not gone, and partly is replaced by other ideologies and power. All this process is well visible in architecture and art. So architecture and urban processes can be interesting tool for re-thinking past for changing future.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>At the moment we working and searching fundings for projects which are directly connected to urban development and architecture. One of the project\u00a0 - Re-thinking the city is focused on different periods of city development - project is based\u00a0 on\u00a0 research of soviet and post soviet architecture, divides history if the city in 6 different periods and themes and aims to realise artistic interventions in different districts of Tbilisi. Also exhibitions, workshops and seminars are planned within the project. Project will continue during 1 year and will have as artistic, also educational function.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>As city is in crisis in present and future is also undefined exactly now we need to re-think, decontextualise and reload the city for future development.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>After the disaster (flood in Tbilisi on 13th of June) we have once more discovered\u00a0 that government and city hall are totally impotent and its time to take initiative in our own hands. Its time to change, its time to act.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Engagement of civil society is really poor in Georgia(well, much better then it was 3-4 years ago, but still not enough to influence decisions of government). So instead of planning one more protest we together with other activists decided to start new movement which wont ask people to gather in front of city hall but to act.</span>\n\n<span>We are trying to focus on different problematic issues as: domination of cars, unsafe city, uncontrolled investments and new buildings, lack of green spaces.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>We already started to give some examples how to reclaim the city e.g. we have blocked one of the sidewalks with flower pots made out of tires. Parking on sidewalks in Tbilisi is allowed, so to walk in street especially with children or for old people becomes more and more dangerous as cars are sometimes even driving really fast(on sidewalks!) sometimes sidewalks are just blocked with cars and one has to cross the street or walk over the cars. So we made a video instruction - how easy it is to occupy sidewalk. Officers tires were moved after one day and plants were through away. But video was shared in Facebook hundred times and also other people made the same in different streets. Except this we are marking different places with stencils: e.g. here once was public pool or here once was a market and etc - on places where instead of different public spaces now monster building are built.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>So in September - on one of the problematic areas of the city, former hippodrome, we are planning big event - ideas laboratory, ideas fair \u201c Conquer the city\u201d. This will be kind of exhibition, open call will be announced and students, artists, architects, urbanists or housewives, anybody who thinks that city needs help, will be invited to present their ideas on platform. For example - one wants to make garden on garage in front of his block but doesn't have funding or just needs help - he/she can bring visualised idea to fair where we also invite different funds and companies - aim is to help people to realise those projects, to start change from small scale, to create different form of resistance, to reclaim the city. And yep, we have to start from our street, ow yard, or block. We have to act, we have to change.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Well, except of paperwork and search of funding we enjoy every single step of the work. For the projects we do in streets (artistic not curatorial projects as homework or http projects) we don't need funding, most of the time we fund our works ourselves, if its not within some festival.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>But to fund bigger projects is quite difficult. Once when i was working at the school of Center of contemporary art -Tbilisi, we had to make final exhibition of students. Funding was only 300 Gel. which is about 120 euros. I suggested to go to casino with this money and gamble together with students. If we would win - we would make exhibition focused on money and funding in art (as in Georgia, also abroad), if we would lose, we would still make a show - presenting only the video which we would get from casino - how we lost money for exhibition, Well, finally i had to refuse from this idea, but maybe i will do it once. Why? to start the discussion how to survive as an artist and that only way for getting funding for exhibition of young artists is to gamble. (also gambling is huge problem in Georgia). So ministry of culture is organisation which doesn't have any clue in contemporary art and sends designers to Venice Biennial instead of artists. (Ah, why Georgia didn't send politicians to biennial, that would be best pavilion in Venice! Best representation for country\u2019s absurd reality)</span>\n\n<span>ok. Yes. Funding, $$$$$$$$$$$. that is problem.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Education. Even bigger problem then funding.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>We need more professionals, we need more initiatives, we need new visions. We need change.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Of course we have individuals who struggle to create better future, to mark Georgia on contemporary art map, to change reality but its too hard to survive.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Revolution, revolution in ourselves - that is what we need. To wake up and to change reality.\u00a0</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-07 18:40:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:32.208827", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1739, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27777, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 2563, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Okay!</b>\n\nI'll look into getting the pattern made from coat.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-24 13:40:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:33.236067", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27776], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32875, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4974, "post_number": 43, "raw": "<b>Relief and Clarity - sounded so nice I had to make a flyer :)</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3c7a4543bc08d391c5da2dd06e6cdc0caddd0dad.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-11 21:22:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:00.426760", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32863], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21129, "user_id": 64, "topic_id": 1681, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Personal vs Collective </b>\n\nOne of the main reasons that Unmonastery appeals to me is that I will be in a peaceful state of being - where I can follow what I love to do.

It is a social form that has long lived in the shadows of our market culture, but which is now on the rise.\"\n\nThis is one aspect of the commons, creation in the wide sense, which provides the 'energy' to hold the whole social fabric together.\n\nQuilligan defines the commons as the collective heritage of humanity, the shared -- natural, genetic, material, intellectual, digital, social and cultural -- resources that we inherit or create, vital for our sustenance and livelihood, our\u00a0individual expression and purpose, our social cohesion, quality of life and well-being, commons also embody the relationships between people, communities and these shared resources.\n\nSo the commons come under the form of\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>'objects' or 'assets' inherited or created that are shared in common and serve a livelihood (natural &amp; cultural resources, genetic and biologic diversity, knowledge, etc) theat people can take care of, nurture, replenish</li>\n\n<li>ways of being and doing in common (caring, sharing, in connection with others with empathy, equity, justice, mindfulness...)</li>\n\n<li>outcomes (well being, health, instruction, quality of life, prosperity, abundance) these become 'inputs' for the next generation, so it's a cycle...</li>\n\n</ul>So the two streams you suggest could be formulated as a sequence:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>How can a culture of commons in a wider sense help communities and policy makers weather the effects of the crisis, overcome the effects of austerity and build resilience etc, by by helping communities take part of their livelihood in their own hands... How can policy serve the commons and commons serve polity? What would this require from policy makers and existing institutions?

Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.\n\nThis new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology. However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain: the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people\u2026) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not. Additionally, any attempt to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.\n\n<strong>What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care?</strong>\n\nWe are going to attempt to do just that. We are launching OpenCare, a two-year, 1.6 million euro research project to design and prototype new care services. We will:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>collect experiences of community-driven care services</li>\n\n<li>validate them through open discussion, both online and offline.</li>\n\n<li>augment them with state-of-the-art maker technology (3D printing, laser cutting, biohacking\u2026)</li>\n\n<li>combine everything we learn into the design and prototype of next generation community driven care services.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThis is way too ambitious for us to do alone, so we'll do it with everybody, leveraging collective intelligence. The whole process will be \u2013 and stay \u2013 open to anyone who wants to participate. We are working on a social contract to acknowledge each and every contribution, and will not make participants into a crowd of rightless volunteers.\n\n<strong>Care is deeply human</strong>. Everyone has first-hand experience of it. Even those if us who are not doctors or nurses or caregivers are occasionally patients (even doctors!); we all have first-hand experience of giving and receving care.

It's a pragmatic approach focused on existing options. (There has been a scientific economic approach already where Eric, Sepp and Alberto <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/voles-and-openings\">talked about highly generic value flow systems</a>.)\n\nThis report is a bit unusual, as it's not centered around any project I'm involved in. Instead, the origin and basis is a discussion about alternative currencies that some of us Edgeryders started <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/quest-paid-work/mission_case/being-paid-doing-what-you-still-impossible#comment-1419\">over here</a>. Many thanks to James, Lucyanna and Betta for their contributions!\n\nI will now go on to introduce you to three widespread flavors of alternative currency, then talk about some personal experiences with them, and finally I will need your opinion on something ...\n\n<h2>Barter currencies</h2><strong>How does it work?</strong> While there had been barter systems before, it was Michael Linton who developed the variant used most commonly today - called LETS (local exchange trading system). This is a local user group where new users have to apply to the not-for-profit organization managing the system, and then get a barter account in a central, mostly web based accounting system. The account starts with zero, cannot be filled by converting legal tender, and there is no interest rate. Account total and turnover total are public. Transactions are voluntary and prices in barter currency units can be negotiated at will. There's a directory of all offers within the group from which users can select.\n\n<strong>Economics.</strong> Mostly, it is said that LETSs are localized in order to keep value circulating in the local economy (by necessity, as the local currency units are worthless out of this system, or alternatively, some systems allow conversion but have high transaction fees for that). So in effect, you will rather buy that bag of vegetables from a local farmer for LETS points rather than imported from around the world, even if the price in LETS points is somewhat higher because the local farmer might not bee too competitive on the globalized food market. On system level, this amounts to a support for / revival of the local economy. The second acclaimed aspect of LETSs is that they make currency more abundant - great for those who are short in legal tender. That's because, in economic terms, LETS is a system of mutual credit. Just that debt is not owed to a bank instittion but to the community of users. And the community is willing to give you credit because it trusts you to pay it back with future offers and services in the LETS system. This even works for unemployed people, who otherwise would not even dare to ask a bank for credit. (Fun fact, missed it myself for 28 years: There's not much difference between a bank and a LETS user, because banks <em>create</em> the money they hand out as credit. It does not exist before. <a href=\"http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Modern_Money_Mechanics\">Not kidding</a>!)\n\n\u00a0 Usually, a LETS has limits in place for both assets and debt, meant to prevent both hoarding and defaults and to keep the currency flowing around. Still, as with every credit scheme, trust is a limiting factor, and in this case trust is only within a well-defined group. That's why most LETS systems are quite small and localized; however there are attempts to connect LETSs together like clearinghouses or <a href=\"http://www.community-exchange.org/\">CES</a> (an \"exchange of exchanges\"), <a href=\"http://ripple-project.org/\">Ripple</a> or <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmb/\">Circular Multilateral Barter</a>. It should be noted that \"local\" character means rather \"confined to a community\", which can be either really a local community or a social community, for example a web based one. If there's trust and cohesion in a community, barter currencies can work.\n\n<strong>Is it successful?</strong> Valuations of success depend, but in practical terms many such barter community systems start enthusiastically but then finally the economic activity comes to a halt. Seems related to lacking sufficient critical mass (enough people) to make this work in the longer term. There are approaches to make a \"global LETS\" possible (see above), but none of them is established so far as a comfortable one-stop solution so that trading with users of other LETSs is quite a difficult interaction so far (and thus, rarely done).\n\n\u00a0 However: barter currencies tend to spring up in cases of economic trouble, and tend to be way more successful in these times (maybe not beyond, but it's a great self-help mechanism anyway). The most interesting developments in this area are going on in Greece at the moment (see the BBC documentary embedded below, also appearing in <a href=\"http://www.shareable.net/blog/volos-greece-taps-alternative-currency-for-a-shareable-city\">this good overview article</a> on sharable.net, which is a platform run by our fellow Edgyryder <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/interview-sharer\">Neal Gorenflo</a>). Greece recently even passed regulation that allows and supports these \"alternative economic systems\".\n\n<strong>How do I start one?</strong> Starting such a local currency is more a matter of finding critical mass, socially, because the technology is all there for free; see an <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/time-banking-software-recommendation\">overview of software for alternative currencies</a> on my site, also including more links about background concepts.\n\n<h2><strong>Time banking</strong></h2><strong>How does it work?</strong> Pretty much the same as LETS, just that the unit of exchange is one hour of work with an egalitarian \"all time is equal\" principle. (There are other variants that value time by qualification or mutual agreement, but these ae really no different from LETS.) There are also \"time saving banks\" where people can save up time, by helping others, to later be redeemed for old age care for example.\n\n<strong>Economics / practical use.</strong> Using work time as the basis of value is based on the \"labor theory of value\" - quite a fringe concept these days, as the competing \"subjective theory of value\" has been broadly adopted. However that's not too much of a problem: currency is a social construct, so it can be designed to deviate from whatever we intuitively / most commonly use to determine value. If a group adopts this new concept, the currency works. Also, I think there are good reasons to argue that the labor theory of value <em>should</em> be adopted again as being more fair: in an untouched world, everything of value to humans is either free or created by investing time. Another note: 1:1 exchange of time has, to my knowledge, a taxation advantage at least in some jurisdictions: it's considered as \"not directed towards gain\", so does not constitute taxable economic activity. While producing own goods and trading them in a LETS system large-scale without operating a company might get you into trouble with tax authorities.\n\n<strong>How do I start one?</strong> Again, it's about building a sufficiently large group for this to work. But in contrast to barter currencies / LETS, this seems to work also with much smaller setups. Personally, I have two such schemes going on where there are only two of us in each one. For the technical side, again see my <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/time-banking-software-recommendation\">overview of software for alternative currencies</a>.\n\n<h2><strong>Bitcoin</strong></h2>Of course there's also <a href=\"http://bitcoin.org/\">Bitcoin</a>. It's attractive on its own terms, yet is neither barter currency nor time bank, rather like digital cash.\n\n<strong>How does it work?</strong> This will be a bit weird for those who never heard of it. Ok then ... the best first contact with Bitcoin is probably the video embedded below, which happens to be the <a href=\"http://www.weusecoins.com/\">nice little clip on weusecoins.com</a>. After watching, you know that Bitcoin is free software, works globally, has no transaction costs, and does not need any central authority (which is needed even in LETS systems and time banks). So there's no third party that you need to trust, as to not interfere with your business (like PayPal does, notoriously) and to not run away with your money.\n\n\u00a0 Technically, this is enabled by a quite ingenious cryptographic scheme: pseudonymous accounts are kept for all Bitcoin owners, and the account balances and transactions are all public and stored on each Bitcoin-enabled computer, in the so-called \"blockchain\". Access to transfering funds from one account to another is possible by cryptographic keys stored on your own computer, and a transaction becomes effective by being approved by the network of Bitcoin software clients: they calculate a new \"block\" for the blockchain, which adds yours and others' transactions to this shared accoiunting ledger.\n\n\u00a0 This block calculation takes a lot of computing effort from all the thousands of networked computers combined - currently <a href=\"http://bitcoincharts.com/bitcoin/\">it's estimated at 137 PetaFLOP/s</a>; compare that with the world's fastest supercomputer, <a href=\"http://i.top500.org/system/177232\">able to do 11 PetaFLOP/s</a>. The result is just a mathematic \"proof of work\" that prevents attackers from creating a forged transaction history. And the one computer who found the solution to the proof-of-work problem is rewarded with 50 newly generated Bitcoins. That's how Bitcoins come into existence, so called \"mining\".\n\n\u00a0 Finally, the new block is published and check by each of the Bitcoin network's computers, including your own if you have the Bitcoin software client running. They check and approve a new block if no double-spending of already spent coins occurs in it, by comparing with the previous transaction history. (And that's how your encryption key to your Bitcoins loses its validity after you transferred them.) Compromised \"evil\" clients may accept a block with double-spending, but they are simply ignored by the well-behaving ones. So the behavior of the whole system (defining the correct transaction history) is implemented only in individual decisions of all participants - nice example of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence\">emergence</a>, and beauty of P2P.\n\n<strong>Economics / practical use.</strong> Bitcoin does not have any of the advantages of LETS over money: Bitcoin and Euro etc. are readily exchangeable, and Bitcoin is not created from P2P credit. Both limit its supply, meaning it is just as hard to earn Bitcoin than it is to earn \"real\" money. Even \"worse\", there's a feature in Bitcoin that cuts of their creation (\"mining\") after ~20 million are in existence, meaning there is no way to do Bitcoin inflation by money volume expansion. The design of Bitcoin is tuned to become a \"great store of value\".\n\n\u00a0 So unlike LETS, Bitcoin as a system does nothing to overcome money scarcity. But its global instant, no-fee, irreversible and quasi-anonymous transactions have earned it some uses as a better Internet payment system already. And after all, if there is a community that <em>decides</em> to keep their money local, it could also use Bitcoin instead of a LETS system, and profit from getting rid of all system maintenance (not tried yet, this is an own idea).\n\n\u00a0 There's also a kind of \"Bitcoin economy\" already, with some hundred small shops trading in Bitcoin and startups offering Bitcoin services; see the <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade\">list of real things and services to buy</a> with Bitcoin. Also, Bitcoin integrates with major webshop applications, for example there is a <a href=\"https://github.com/ticean/magento-bitcoin#readme\">Bitcoin module for Magento</a>.\n\n<strong>How do I start?</strong> To start using Bitcoin, you basically need to install it on your computer and learn how it works:\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Download the Bitcoin client software from <a href=\"http://bitcoin.org/\">bitcoin.org</a>, install it. Wait for some hours to download the so-called blockchain (some hundred megabytes).</li>\n\n<li>Get some Bitcoins. Usual way is to buy some on a <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Currency_exchanges\">Bitcoin exchange</a>, but you could also sell something on, say, <a href=\"http://bitmit.net/\">bitmit.net</a> (Bitcoin auction / shopping portal).</li>\n\n<li>To buy something, you'll have to use the Bitcoin client to send some of your bitcoins to the receiver's bitcoin address, which looks like for example \"143PV9zhJUwCiTDD8i7FE16JbfiJvX9zQo\". The transaction is more or less instant and basically cost-free, and shows up in the other party's Bitcoin client.</li>\n\n<li>To receive Bitcoins, hand out one of your Bitcoin addresses shown in your Bitcoin client software.</li>\n\n<li>((Important: before you get involved in Bitcoin with larger sums of money, ask or learn about securing your Bitcoin wallet. Theft has happened and equates to accessing an unencrypted wallet.dat file on your computer. And, theft is irreversible!))</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<strong>Bounty: your first Bitcoin.</strong> I am into Bitcoin for a year now and like to introduce people to it ... so may I give you a little incentive? I will send 1 Bitcoin (ca. 4 EUR currently) to the first person from Edgeryders who is new to Bitcoin and manages to post their Bitcoin receiving address in the comments.\n\n</div><h2>Personal Experiences</h2><div class=\"content\">\n\nMy problem with local currencies so far is that they are local (because I'm frequently changing places, so involvement on the local level is not sustainable for me). However I did some experiments to find my place in all this:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Internationally: fail.</strong> Opened an account at the <a href=\"http://www.community-exchange.org/docs/join2.asp?xid=GLOG\">Global Groups Exchange</a> group at <a href=\"http://www.community-exchange.org/\">CES</a>. This is their only time-based international group, so it seemed quite appropriate. Yet it's not busy there: the social critical mass is missing to make it a success. Also they don't have an egalitarian \"all time is worth equal\" principle there, means you can charge more than 60 minutes per hour if you like; I'm not too much of a fan of that idea.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Among friends: fail.</strong> Once I had installed <a href=\"http://project.cyclos.org/\">Cyclos</a> on an own server (which is an impressive and free time banking and LETS software by the way). Had planned to use it among friends as a compensation system for time spent in neighborly help, to maintain fairness here. However those friends\u00a0 friends were not too enthusiastic about it, and anyway, just a groups of friends would not provide the necessary group size for the system to take off.</li>\n\n<li><strong>In our startup: win.</strong> We have a time based compensation system going in the startup company that I'm involved in. Every one of the founders records their working hours, enters it into a (self-developed) web based software, and the system always attributes a share of the company's total gain according to the total work hours. So, all time is valued equally, including re-valueing past work times as the company's financial results change. It's my best experience with practical time banking yet, works really smooth and we never had to talk about or even quarrelled about money in our startup.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Bitcoin: interesting.</strong> As another part of alternative currencies, I'm involved in <a href=\"http://bitcoin.org/\">Bitcoin</a> - but not mining or speculation, which are the main activities in the Bitcoin economy so far. So for now, I'm experimenting with it a bit, like buying things on <a href=\"http://bitmit.net/\">bitmit.net</a> for Bitcoins, and also I plan to accept Bitcoins in a webshop that I'm running.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div><h2>Note to Policymakers</h2>As shown above, Local Exchange Trading Systems and timebanks are value transfer systems that overcome personal liquidity issues entailed in the bank-centered system of legal tender. They offer economic development options amidst all the current economic collapse and high unemployment, potentially also triggerig a revival of the formal economy. So it is proposed here to enact EU-wide regulation that gives non-profit status to local currency initiatives, not taxing any transaction happening there. (This exemption can be limited to individual self-supply transactions; there is no need to allow big business, as local currencies are intended as a means of self-help in tough times.)\n\nSuch policy has already been exemplified in Greece in September 2011. Quoting the NY Times:\n\n\"Last week, [Greek] Parliament passed a law sponsored by the Labor Ministry to encourage the creation of \u201calternative forms of entrepreneurship and local development,\u201d including networks based on an exchange of goods and services. The law for the first time fills in a regulatory gray area, giving such groups nonprofit status.\" [<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/world/europe/in-greece-barter-networks-surge.html\">source</a>]\n\n<h2>Call for Opinions: Timebanking on Edgeryders?</h2>This nice idea was raised by lucyanna in the original discussion:\n\n\"It would be great for this community to actually test a time-banking system, this will help us all understand in a practical way how alternative currencies work.\"[<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/quest-paid-work/mission_case/being-paid-doing-what-you-still-impossible#comment-1677\">source</a>]\n\nPersonally I'd welcome an Edgeryders time-bank - because I'd fill more into the \"haves\" and \"needs\" profile sections if I knew that mutual compensation is ensured.\n\nNow, fellow Edgeryders, we need your opinions: Do you think this is feasible, do we have the \"social critical mass\" together for it? Do you think this experiment would provide valuable insights and / or relevant practical use value by means of mutual help? Would you want to participate? Alberto is open for such an experiment on Edgeryders in principle, but I'm not an expert to know if we as a community are in a position to make this a success. So please tell us what you think!\n\n(What I could contribute is the tech part. I found a comfortable and free software that just fits: <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/mutual_credit\">mutual_credit Drupal module</a>.

I am so happy we finally managed to find the time to really meet one another and have an open conversation(s) about many questions and issues. Including where we want to take things looking forward together.\n\nAfter our conversations it struck me that one of the fundamental errors I have been making is forgetting that there is a huge information asymmetry between those of us who have been involved in Edgeryders for the longest and more recent arrivals. Step one to honoring our pledge to bridge that divide so we have more of a level playing field is online: <a href=\"/t/lets-adore-and-endure-each-other/3865\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/blog/lets-adore-and-endure-each-other</a>\n\nTo honor the care and attention that went into our coming together, I thought it might be a good idea to put together a simple overview to remind us all of what was agreed (before we forget :)) and make it easy for others to contribute towards the shared goals/initiatives. Can you guys help compile this here so that we are sure everyone understands the same thing (when we speak it is easy to misunderstand because of language differences or miss key information when your mind wanders):\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">The big picture: What we agreed on</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">1. A key aim of Edgeryders is to facilitate and encourage mutual support between community members and collaboration on projects.</h3>\n\nSo over the next year we are going to focus energy on\n\n<strong>A. Harmonious Hackathons:</strong> making them happen on a regular basis (several times a year) and making them an economically sustainable line of activity (ensure people organising them are paid). We also agreed that we need \"our own\" space to do this as hackathons need to run for weeks rather than days to \"complete\" work, but still keep money and time costs at an acceptable level. We would do a number of themes one of which could be HackCare continuing on foundation set at lote4.\n\n<strong>B. Edgeryders/ Makerfox integration:</strong> the experiment with using barter to build \\#lote4 using makerfox produced promising results. In order for us to use it for more activities the integration with Edgeryders needs to be smoother, so we need to specify what needs to be done and find resources to cover the cost of the work.<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong>C. Building stronger community ties:</strong> We aim to grow the number, thickness and quality of Edgeryders community members social ties with each other, members of other communities and networks and with members of organisations with resources and need for their skills/projects. We will do this online with regularly updated content like Jeffs posts and a newsletter (who knows how to do this well?). If and when we do organise physical meetings, we commit to ensure they are properly documented online so as not to fragment the community or exclude others from the conversations. Core team: Ben Vickers (UK) and Nadia EL-Imam (Belgium) and you (wherever you are).\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">2. The unMonastery prototype was successful and we want to continue developing the existing site and set up new ones.</h3>\n\nIt was agreed that the time is not mature for setting up a separate unMonastery organisation and that Edgeryders LBG should continue to be the \"home organisation\" for the unMonastery project.\n\n<strong>A. Continued presence in the Palazzo Casale complex:</strong>\u00a0 it was agreed that the next step would be to produce a credible plan for running the space including revenue streams/fundraising activities in order to present to the Committato Matera2019 before they are dissolved (i.e. before end of the working year).<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong>B. New possible unMonastery sites:</strong> Edgeryders LBG has been approached by with two requests for new development projects which could involve setting up new unMonastery sites. After discussing the matter with community members in the room one proposal was sent off to Fabrizio Barca.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">3. We would like to experiment with different formats for community events</h3>\n\n<strong>A. Produce \\#lote4 community report:</strong> To get an overview of the value generated from this event in a format that is easy to understand and spread ( also for those with little or no time to wade through a lot of material on the platform). This report should cover\u00a0:\n\n<strong><em>- Content</em></strong>- (<a href=\"/t/what-we-have-learned-about-building-resilience-of-community-powered-projects-and-the-people-who-drive-them/3847\">what was learned about stewardship and what new insights/ideas for projects and new questions were generated</a>).\n\n<strong><em>- Organisation</em></strong>- budget, allocation of resources, how decisions were made and what are the constraints we acknowledge.\n\n<strong>B. Call for proposals of new event formats (and teams to drive them):</strong> Proposals ranged from piggybacking existing events like CCC and making ourselves visible as \"Edgeryders\", to making them more harmonious hackathon focused, to doing a walking format (we organise a long trek and people do lectures/host conversations while walking or during breaks).

Of course, small companies are scared of new things, and there should be the reason for them to trust us.
