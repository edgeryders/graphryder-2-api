I'm trying to connect dots through what the involved have been saying. It's maybe some rambling, bear with me.\n\n@lucy has been mentioning Mycelium Running by Paul Stamets in our conversations and it reminds me of a similar book about mushroom cultivation that I've read. The story of these kinds of books is usually similar: passionate person, usually nearing the end of their career, share the expertise they have built over 20-50 years of doing it _in the field_. So they are not scientific reports, and usually the writers are not scientists. You'll read things like \"use empty jam jars and cook them in your pressure cooker on the stove\". But: the decades of experience are as valid as what is regarded as science. Even if the knowledge is not \"formalized\" in papers or articles: the results have been tested, reproduced over decades. I'd say this makes this kind of knowledge more valid than science: it's antifragile.\n\nSo these books and their impact is not new, but the approach is not efficient (takes a lifetime to make them) or sufficient (we don't have many lifetimes left to solve our problems). This is where the collective intelligence tools can make a big difference: can we crowdsource a highly locally contextualized manual of the same level with a large group of citizen researchers, over eg. 2 years?\n\nThis is perfect material for energetic wanna-be mushroom farmers and I'm sure every single local mushroom producer has in some way benefited from Stamets' knowledge. It connects to what Milan said about wanting a connection to local entrepreneurship. The kind of data that is produced by citizen science is potentially readily usable for entrepreneurship.\n\nWe have positive experiences ourselves with doing research to draft manuals. We crowdsourced (among a handful of people) our own [manual on mushroom materials](/t/id/8081) about two years ago. The impact locally has been big. It has enabled hundreds, if not thousands, of people to start right away and has helped out several startups. There's signs that the impact is also there internationally. Next week we're doing a [Wikithon](https://www.facebook.com/events/836610963216399/) to make more different manuals. These are some methods we could use.\n\nSo @cindy mentions correctly that\n\n> Citizen data is of a different scale and provides a different perspective: it is often hyperlocal and is sometimes accompanied by qualitative context which provides insight and granularity that 'professional data' that aims to be 'objective' does not. They have a complementary role and so the real issue in my opinion is that this is not generally recognised and is at odds with the way canonical science currently operates.\n \nBasically I understand it as more applied & contextual knowledge. More applied than how it is generally understood by science (applied research funding calls are still more theoretical). And in my activities as a social entrepreneur, it is all about contextual knowledge. In essence entrepreneurship is high-tempo interdisciplinary science for me.\n\nThoughts? Does anyone have other conclusions, or similar ones?\n\nping @anique.yael @alberto @rachel", "created_at": "2018-03-13 10:56:27.831045", "updated_at": "2018-05-02 21:58:04.088750", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 533, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 200.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4265, 3904, 3704, 3708], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63133, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11349, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Added you on everything", "created_at": "2019-11-06 07:02:35.836908", "updated_at": "2019-11-06 07:02:35.836908", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [63115], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35168, "user_id": 147, "topic_id": 6855, "post_number": 7, "raw": "St Patrick himself was a slave.

In that direction the castle and Demense have played a founding role in their survival this last three hundred years.

It is perhaps an accident of chance that the current head of the Opus Dei is an Ui Chuilen\u00e1in, as the philosopher king C\u00f3rmaic Ui Chuilan\u00e1in was the Bishop of Cashel before him in the 9th century. The Church at that time was hereditary, primogeniture, passing to the eldest son, as clergy still had the right to marry. Apparently it was the strength of the Irish church that was the cause of the decree forbidding marriage in the second lateran council of the mid twelfth century.\n\nMy g-g-great grand father would have overseen lists I have dug out of a century and a half of pigeon shit in the corner of an upper floor room, burnt out just last month, at the workhouse here in Birr back during the famine. They detail the imports, tea and sugar from Calcutta, sweet cream, grain, cloth, and so on. There was a cape buried in there too. No ordinary garment, though partly decomposed.  i wonder was it his? Was he a good man? ...

His people were clergy, and were afforded the benefits of the church as the fruit of their labour, a labour in good Faith. He could not be argued. Odd to think the lengths to which an institution might go to rid themselves of a particular bloodline, and the scale of time they gather into their reckoning! ;)\n\nThere were also the O Dempseys and the L\u00e1lors,  of which was one Patt Lalor, repeal MP, father to James Finland L\u00e1lor, a man always sickly, who spoke and wrote against the tithes and markedly stirred revolutionary foment in his time. The tithes were payments extracted by the clergy from farmers and tenants, 10% of their earnings paid in kind by a metric not of their own making. The people squeezed, revolted.\n\nIn Ireland the land is important, I know it, still, and deeply. I respect that we live of it, that soil, as you call it, is ancestry.

I'm friends with the owner and I casually pitched him on doing this concept there and he was interested. He had on his own thought about starting some kind of an artist community someplace anyway. Maybe as part of this effort I could get him on board and we could renovate the building and propagate it with a few dozen people to try out the concept. I suppose a grant from the government would be a nice facilitator of this although it would need to be a no-strings attached grant where documentation on the experiment was all they wanted. You don't want the government tampering with your lifestyle so them designing your living and working space isn't ideal. But funding it, why not.\n\nThe key to these spaces though is that they be low cost to the individuals and each person pays rent rather then the government paying their rent for them. This way they are free to travel, stay with friends and family, move in with a lover or do what ever they want and they still get their unemployment checks. You've got to give people control over their lives. Cash is the best way to support the unemployed. I know there is fear they'll just spend it on drugs, alcohol and other frivolous things but you can't use policy to fight self destructive behavior you have to let culture do that. The more there is to look forward to the less self destructive people will be.\n\nSo I think that the role of government is just to take from the tax pool and help people with no job keep afloat by giving them unemployment checks each month for at least $300 us dollar equivalent. The more the better but not so much it's a big tax burden. People don't like too much taxation.\n\nDo you now what someone in Latvia can get when collecting unemployment? It would be good to know what each country in the region provides.\n\nHere is another idea. Collapse borders a bit for the unemployment. So have essentially an unemployed visa in which a person is allowed to live in a country as long as they want as long as they don't get an official job. But allow them to work for free. This way people are encouraged to travel to other countries and gain work experience.\n\nTravel increases the value of someone in the freelance marketplace. To get more travelers leaving the country it might be smart to get some entering too. So for example you get Latvia to make a deal with india for a one to one trade on people who can stay as long as they want. So for everyone willing to go immerse in India there is someone who can come immerse from India. Someone developing IT programming skills could really benefit from a program like that.\n\nSkills are naturally and organically passed along when people live and work together even if they aren't working on the same projects. When you need help and can ask someone that knows there is a natural mentorship that takes place.\n\nI've worked at start up companies and the missing resource is always IT. So anything that increases IT talent can increase the overall economy of that place. So if I were these countries I'd be strategizing a race to develop the most IT talent. So that's programmers, developers, coders, iOS &amp; android developers, UX design and all aspects of digital software design. So allowing others with any of these skills into the country on an unemployment salary would put them most likely elbow to elbow with other unemployed who would then start to gain their skills.\n\nTunisa is a good example where these skills are learned but then there are no jobs that can utilize these skills so people end up living with their families. If those people were invited to say Latvia there would be a culture clash for sure but it would be a really interesting opportunity for them to share their skills with other unemployed people.\n\nI know it's counter intuitive to spend money allowing foreigners to live in your country but the more you create international groups working together the more you improve the hire-ability of everyone involved.\n\nI've personally gone up in value just be exporting myself to places where my skills were less common and then each new place I go the perceived value goes up becomes of places I've worked.\n\nAnother idea is crowd funding projects with government funds. It's what Max is doing. It's a great model. Make the people who want more then a normal amount of funding have to participate in a grant process where the application is public on the web and functions as a crowd funding campaign. As people donate money to projects that money is tripled by a governmental match. That's a little different then Max's model but I think it's good because it causes people to commit to some of their own money to help make a project happen but not as much as if it was a pure crowd funding campaign.\n\nAlso a free labor directory where people learn through doing and building collaborative networks. DIYdays.com will have in a few months a directory like this that will slowly be opened up beyond event goers. If it's not universal enough then a new one can be made. Linked in is already pretty good actually. But lacks in the department of assisting people to find free labor.\n\nImagine a directory where people list their skills and get discovered to be a part of projects they then choose to accept or decline based on their level of passion for the work.\n\nYou said something to this effect. You like not getting paid because then you don't have to do with people tell you if you don't want to. By creating an ecosystem of projects that only happen when people have the passion to make them happen the over all catalog of projects should dramatically improve.\n\nThen you get the media to hype up successful work and a snowball effect begins.\n\nThis should of course be a world wide network so it's also getting people international experience.\n\nHere is another good one:\n\nTake them to burning man. I know this is a radical concept and unlikely to be funded by any government but it's been reported that people often solve their monetary problems after a trip to burning man. I think that because it's a survivalist event it ignites a dormant survival mechanism dead in our modern brains. When you have to build a yurt and survive vicious dust storms and remember to bring water every where and build a kitchen from scratch and live with no electricity or running water you get really good at taking care of yourself. This skill I think translates directly back into real life as one is lining up their life to provide all of the things they need. Plus you start to look at what you need differently. You realize how minimally you can really live. How simple a living accommodation can really be. Even the food rationing you do at burning man can translate to your default life and improve ones rationing of money and relationship to food decreasing how much they think they need to eat. Plus many camps rotate cooking shifts and I've camped with people who's first experience cooking was at burning man. And they were well into their twenties. Google Burning man regional events to see events closer and cheaper to attend then Burning Man. Any survival based event would instill these skills. So governments could provide scholarships to survival skill events or workshops.\n\nAlso... more on the food topic. It might not be so much about getting jobs for these people as it is about improving the quality of life they can achieve on the small amount they get in their unemployment checks. So maybe scholarships for cooking classes? Or maybe funding for a book called, \"the unemployed cookbook\" teaching people to cook rich food while broke. The book could celebrate not having a job and having lots of time to cook really good food that costs almost nothing and makes the body and mind healthier providing a higher quality of life then those with jobs and no time to take care of themselves.\n\nFinally... english. Get everyone working in english because it's the language a lot of business is done in. Get them working on international projects where they get better at their english in professional settings. Create a culture that accepts correcting peoples bad english. I'm still working on my english as you can see in this sloppy email so definitely we need to get people who speak it as a second language to be better practiced in english to give them a competitive advantage. Also those who have english down very well should travel to places where they need english teachers. Most of asia is short on english teachers in my traveling experience. United arab Emirates apparently pays really well for english teachers.\n\nDating site for the unemployed. Improve their quality of life by connecting unemployed people with other unemployed people. Nothing is worse then a significant other always yelling at you to get a job. Actually the only thing worse is being unemployed and single. Find a match who won't bitch about you not having a job and who can appreciate picnics and illegally downloaded movies and other free fun like good sex all day because neither of you have a job you have to go to.\n\nNYsockExchange - This is an idea born out of a hack-a-thon group I was part of during occupy wall street. But we didn't build it, just conceptualized. The idea was to help people with socks that don't match find other socks of the correct color and shape and then link them up using an app. We were going to flood the New York Stock Exchange with socks as a publicity stunt but then all the arrests went out of style so we called it off. This tool could be used to connect a guy who has two coats but no boots with a guy that has 4 boots and no coat. This kind of a stuff finder is like craigslist designed for people with no money. Instead of the guy having to sell his boots to get the money to buy the coat you create a pay it forward gift economy. Let's say it's not the guy who has 4 boots that needs the coat so it's not an easy exchange. If you create a pay it forward gift economy solution like couchsurfing.com then instead of each person giving and receiving value from individual each person gives and receives value from the network of individuals so it doesn't matter who gave you something or when they gave it to you. It all goes in a digital bank and improves ones ranking by giving more which then encourages others to give more to them to improve their ranking and get more from others. Alternative economies are definitely part of the solution to unemployment.\n\nI could really keep going... and going...\n\nThe point is I'm unemployed, always have been, always will be, but I make a lot of money, make my own films, have a pretty fun life and think that a jobless world is a better world and think the unemployed population shouldn't be looked at as a problem to be corrected but as an asset to be maintained and nourished so this unique class can ultimately thrive above the rest until we all dream of being unemployed because it's just got style.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-02-12 17:22:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:28.955876", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2776, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42766, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 8294, "post_number": 2, "raw": "openvillage solutions! @matthias no? :)", "created_at": "2018-03-13 12:12:53.227505", "updated_at": "2018-03-13 12:12:53.227505", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 67.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3811], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9053, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 5772, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Business opportunities</b>\n\nI like the V\u00e9lo M2 and have long been a cargobike fan \u2026 esp. the M55 design you have there :-) Funding for social and cultural activities is notoriously hard to obtain, so maybe cross-fund these activities by selling your cargo bike modules?

I\u2019ve been an educational technologist for the last 25 years, working with a range of schools and for profit businesses I\u2019ve been working on my first novel part time for a few years and I\u2019m almost ready to publish. I\u2019m a lifelong science fiction reader who loves economic fiction including Cory Doctorow\u2019s work, Charlie Stross\u2019 Singularity series, Neal Stephenson\u2019s Baroque cycle, Cryptonomicon, and The Diamond Age, and of course the post-scarcity economics of Star Trek. Reading in economics is also a hobby. I recently finished Mariana Mazzucato's \"The Value of Everything\" and Jeremy Rifkin's \"The Zero Marginal Cost Society\".\n\nI\u2019m interested in joining the Science Fiction Economics Lab to both help improve my own writing and to help create new thinking around economics. My fiction tries to explore alternative means of organizing human production and resource distribution. The central thematic conflict in my book (and the plan for the series) is the struggle for the creation of a human-centered economy based on true accounting for biophysical limits and externalities. \n\nWe all know the limits of the current economic system and we can see the looming crises as we run into the biophysical and human limits the it ignores. Ironically it was Milton Friedman who said \u201cOnly a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.\u201d We need a better class of ideas lying around. \n\nI\u2019d love to join the Lab to work with other smart, creative people to explore ideas for new economic models so the ideas can be lying around as we pass through the coming crises. As my friend Jamais Casicio put it in a recent talk \u201cThis is a remarkable point in history. Our past theories and practices have failed us. The futures that we imagined we\u2019d have, that we\u2019d hoped for, have been washed away in front of us. We can see with greater clarity than ever before the interwoven consequences of our decisions, and we are now left with the most terrifying of opportunities: We have to create something new.\u201d\n\nWhile I have some ideas, I\u2019d love to explore a set of questions with the other participants. What if every human had intrinsic economic worth? What might a monetary system that reflected biophysical reality rather than feudal and colonial hegemony look like? How might we align systems with outcomes (health, happiness, welfare) rather than outputs (medicine, entertainment, money)? What might the political and cultural path to get us there entail? What stories would we tell during and after the transition? What will the struggle look like?\n\nIn the imagined economics I want to explore in my books, I assume energy and human ingenuity are the ultimate economic substitutes. With enough energy, we can create any material goods we wish. Building a currency based on energy production But until we have cheap fusion or a Dyson swarm, energy is a constraint. Human ingenuity can reduce the need for energy to achieve outcomes through scientific exploration, psychological understanding and cooperative forms of organization.

But practically speaking, how do we create the conditions where there is a positive cycle of care: where one person's care of another results in the second person being able to care more, and so on.\n\nI'm glad you named the purpose \"to bring about greater love\". That comes across to me as having a deep and strong foundation.\n\nOn a practical, psychological level, my own experience is that if I care for people who don't share my values to some extent, it can be dispiriting. Like giving to people who believe only in taking, and not giving back, can be very taxing. So one thing, which is no different from what you have said, in different ways perhaps, is to bring people together in a community where people share the values of caring for others, giving back, giving forward, or something similar. People who want greater love in the world, and not just for themselves!\n\nI believe there are many skills, relevant to this, that can be learned. Or if not learned, then maybe picked up from living in a culture where they are norms, through a process you could call \"enculturation\".

Design is a batch activity: when it's done, the generated design sits there for further consultation. This means that the planner has near to total latitude in choosing whatever tool she like, because the need for coordination with others is minimal. The spreadsheet has proven to be far and away the most valuable planning tool, at least for us. Every Edgeryders project as at least some back-of-the-envelope allocation of resources on a spreadsheet. In some cases, we are required to build Gantt or PERT charts.\n\nExecution requires tighter coordination, hence some kind of management. I see Dynalist as a management tool, not a planning one:\n\n* It is a management tool because it breaks down the project into a to-do list, with native support for personal to-do-lists. Each person can simply work through their own to-do list as created by management; no need for a big picture view of the project, at least in principle. \n* It is not a planning tool because just seeing the list does not intuitively resolve into a bird's eye view of the project. It does not support computation (like spreadsheets) not visualization (like GanttProject or similar). \n\nDynalist is attractively simple and no-nonsense. But, at least to me, it's barely fit for purpose as long as it does not support notifications. \n\nTrello, as I see it, attempts to be both. Its metaphor for the planning function is the notice board. The idea is that seeing your project lined out as a set of re-arrangeable virtual post-its will help you think about it. \n\nIn my own opinion, this metaphor is weak. It does not add any information to just writing things down in Google Doc, or a piece of paper. Others like it. \n\nOn the execution side, my experience is underwhelming. I have never been part of a team that was able to actually use it. The normal pattern is this: someone proposes it as a tool, people accept, the board is created but then not maintained. Trello requires a very disciplined team, with tight coordination. I used other tools with similar issues: they give you an integrated environment with tasks, notices, chat, everything commentable. To make the most of it, you need to be on it hours a day. I suspect they were designed with high-effort intensity projects in mind: complicated software development ones. People are working 8-10 hours per day on the project, and so they work with the environment always open. It helps that they have bosses, and they are not allowed to opt out. This was my contribution to the ongoing search for a tool: it has to be dead simple and lightweight.\n\nBut this, I repeat, only applies to management tools, which need to be shared across whole teams. When you design you are mostly alone, you do not need to coordinate (much), so you are quite free to choose what you want.", "created_at": "2018-05-08 08:29:08.071242", "updated_at": "2018-05-08 08:29:08.071242", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 534, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 62.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69915, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 12598, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I mentioned this in response to @jakobskote's research project on the platform [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/architects-researchers-into-collaborative-practices/12557/10?u=amelia) -- this question of  citizen participation is central to my doctoral thesis, and something I'm really interested in:\n\n[quote=\"amelia, post:10, topic:12557\"]\nSo potential research questions abound. My work is trying to ask/show a) how people are ALREADY participating, if you pay enough attention (to participation as interacting with the city itself, not just as responding to a feedback questionnaire or coming to sessions structured by interests of the planners) and b) how we can incorporate that kind of participation into planning.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to just say \u201ccitizens should be more active\u201d \u2013 more work has to go into imagining how they might want to participate and how this is already happening.\n[/quote]\n\nThe issue, at least in the area of smart cities, is twofold: one is what you mention @alberto : when people do participate, their thoughts are only incorporated in limited ways. A lot of going through the motions. So people decide -- not worth my time. And rightly so. \n\nThe second issue is even when citizen engagement/participation as an abstract concept is valued, people don't know how to do it in a way that actually works for the citizens. It's a funny synchronicity, @alberto, but my main argument is actually that we have to see engagement as action, not as voice in a democratic public sphere.

This is due to a re-evaluation of timescales, firstly there are hoops to be jumped through, as the process of refitting the building is not a simple one, it involves many stakeholders including local government.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSecondly the timeline for the international call, the process required when public money is at stake requires that we be rigorous and fair in our evaluation of applicants, which means more time than anticipated. Since this is the prototype we want to try and get things right the first time, it's safe to say we're learning many useful lessons along the way that can help support other EdgeRyders projects in the future.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"western\" style=\"color:Blue;\">Technical Details</h3>\n\n<span>Over the course of the last few months there have been a number of changes to unMonastery and a set of decisions made around the prototype in Matera, these are as follows:</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tDuration of prototype will be 4 months, currently February-June 2014</li>\n\n<li>\t\tThe building can host up to 10 individuals/projects at anyone time \u2013 the restriction in numbers is budgetary, taking into account food and a small fund for supporting projects \u2013 however if individuals were to self fund/fund raise, the unMonastery may be able to host an additional 5 people or projects.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tApplications to the unMonastery can last from 1-4 months and will operate similarly to the typical residency model.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tThe criteria for applications will be based on and selected according to how closely projects meet the needs set out in the Matera Challenges.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tFellow EdgeRyder and resident of Matera Andrea Paoletti has been hired by MT2019 to interface between the unMonastery project and Matera.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAs a way of building capacity and introducing the EdgeRyders network to Matera and vice versa, unMonastery are set to host LOTE3.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tThe local municipality have hired a team of architects to fit out the building, plans for the building can be viewed <a href=\"http://unmonastery.eu/plans.pdf\">here</a>\u00a0\u2013 although rooms are designated with certain uses, it should be noted this is not confirmed, we intend to co-design the use of rooms over the coming months.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tThe international call for applications is overdue, it is however 80% finished and will go live before the end of the month.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tunMonastery is to be covered in the Italian version of Wired magazine shortly.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"western\" style=\"color:Blue;\">unMonastery and LOTE3</h3>\n\n<span>Everyone is likely to be aware by now that preparation for LOTE3 is well under way, with a workspace found <a href=\"http://lote.edgeryders.eu/\">here</a> and weekly community conference calls for advancing the development of the event.</span>\n\nSomething though is missing, the concrete offering from\u00a0unMonastery itself, when we (myself, Nadia and Alberto) decided in Matera last month that the unconference was to happen there, we decided to split the work. EdgeRyders would manage the delivery of LOTE3 as an unconference in its own right, followed by a week of unMonastery activity.\n\nInformation on what this will look like has yet to be refined but the intention is to run a week long test run of unMonastery with between 15-25 individuals. Counter to the intensity of LOTE3 the aim will be to structure a slow burning immersive and meditative schedule - with each individual participating presenting a morning skill sharing workshop for the group, each evening 2 individuals will work together to prepare dinner for the others and the night time being punctuated with a talk or performance from someone present. The intention is to create an open space for collaboration focused on the theme of future forms for collective living and the potential of unMonastery. Myself and Bembo will follow up this week with a post about how we imagine this to work, how to get involved and questions about how we can make this a worthy event.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"western\" style=\"color:Blue;\"><span>Nominet Bid \u2013 unMonastery in-a-box</span></h3>\n\n<span>Crucial to the development of unMonastery and the potential success of the Matera prototype next year will in part be the ability to record and replicate the model in other places. As stated from the start unMonastery is designed to be a network of spaces that unMonasterians can travel between. So with this in mind we've started working on a tool to make that possible.</span>\n\nWhat we realised quite early on is that the very nature of this problem is one that is endemic and pervasive across all grass roots networks, small institutions and direct actions. Too much social innovation happens in small, disconnected projects and is disseminated in dry case studies that overstate success and downplay failures. Similar problems are being faced, and similar solutions often reappear.\n\nunMonastery in-a-box aims to be the hackerspace equivalent of <a href=\"http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Design_Patterns\">design patterns</a>, and models itself on <a href=\"http://github.com\">GitHub </a>, perhaps best understood as a repository for institutional memory, it's being built to ensure mistakes aren't repeated, lessons are shared and tacit knowledge is stored.

Many people in poorer communities or developing countries have no way of getting appropriate treatment for diabetes. This leads to <strong>serious ilnesses</strong> such as blindness, amputations, cardiovascular disease and ultimately coma or death.\n\nThere is <strong>no generic insulin</strong> on the market and prices are kept high by patent strategies of the few companies that control the market. We're trying to change this by open sourcing the knowledge required to produce insulin.\n\nAs an obvious result this would allow production of <strong>cheaper insulin</strong> by generic suppliers. It might also enable <strong>home brewing</strong> of insulin or <strong>local microfactories</strong> in remote areas. Moreover, it can serve as a fertile soil for more open innovation and citizen science in research.\n\nStill, the scope of this project is <strong>narrowly defined</strong>: develop and validate a production method for insulin. Patient testing and further engineering are not on the table before this important milestone.\n\nThe original <a href=\"/t/how-open-insulin-works-to-open-source-science-and-medicine/519\">Open Insulin</a> team from Counter Culture Labs started out by attempting to <strong>modify <em>E. Coli</em> bacteria</strong> to produce the precursors of human insulin, which has proven successful. Next steps are purification and turning it into human insulin.\n\nThe actual lab work is done locally and the open conversation takes place online.

We will keep this option in mind and use what you've written here as guidance and reference. \n\n[quote=\"leobard, post:14, topic:9071\"]\nLinkedData has been around since 1998 and it is heavily used by the search engines (Google) and for marking up data all over the web.

You find a lot more sources about RDF, but its harder to decide what is useful and what not.\n[/quote]\n\nIndeed this has been my experience in trying to research this lately. I've also spoken to a few developers about it, and most of them are pretty oblivious about RDF. If they're familiar with it at all, they just know it by name, and usually only if they've been in the game for over 10 years. Running projects like ours, we're usually not working with developers with 15+ years experience since most of them are busy with their full time jobs. In the long term, I'm hoping to build a development lab in which creative developers at all levels \u2013 veterans and fresh talent \u2013 can work on experimental and fun projects some of their time. Eventually I hope to tie a wide group of developers to the [Participio Development Lab](https://edgeryders.eu/t/participio-development-lab/9108?u=hugi), and in the future I could absolutely see us tinkering with RDF and Solid.\n\nI'll quote the Participio mission statement here for reference:\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:1, topic:9108\"]\n##Edgeryders Participio Development Lab\nParticipio is a development lab within Edgeryders.

Some devices, however, are also equipped with a voice interaction system, that allows users to utilize this technology without using their sight.\n\nNevertheless, the totality of these electrical devices equipped with an alternative interface is very narrow and confined and is often regarding popular customary appliances, such as smartphones, domestic or medical scales.\nIn Italy, therefore, finding \u201cvoice instruments\u201d (as weather stations, domestic thermostats, washing machines or digital multimeters) is quite difficult, if not impossible.\n\nInitially, while working in a chemistry lab, I thought about building a measuring instrument particularly useful in these contexts: a speaking pH-meter.\n\nThe first prototype of this innovative instrument has been carried out through an analog pH sensor, an audio module WTV020, both controlled by an Arduino Uno board, the core of the device.\n\nThe first version of the speaking pH-meter can pronounce sequentially the entire part, if necessary the word \u201ccomma\u201d and the decimal portion of pH value when the probe is immersed in a liquid.\n\nIn the following versions, after carrying out some research, I thought about using a Mini DF Player as an audio module, rather than a WTV020 (more troubled and sophisticated to manage), while I decided to use an AtMega 328 as a control unit, streamlining the whole system.\n\nThe key point of the subsequent developments was the possibility to use the pH-meter vocal system on other instruments, such as a barometer, an ammeter or even a dishwasher.\nIn order to meet these requirements it is necessary to know how to manage a huge amount of information and values, differently from the pH measurement, that ranges from 0 to 14.\n\nTo achieve this it is necessary to subdivide the value or the information in the different parts that compose pronunciation, and subsequently manage microcontroller\u2019s routine in order to play audio tracks.\n\nThe last step of the project consists of creating a case to contain all the electronic components. As for the small devices, in order to cut costs, I have decided to work with laser cutter machine, puncturing and customizing standard boxes, whenever possible. While, regarding particular devices, I have decided to cut and assemble the different sides of the case.", "created_at": "2017-08-08 13:12:26.579040", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 16:09:14.238572", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 597, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 382.6, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1003, 3310, 3002, 3362, 3143, 3209, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51760, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 9623, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Sorry for dropping out from the team call, internet got shut down in Armenia for almost an hour (blame it on Mercury Retrograde :D )\n\nI like Art Talks and Edge Talks. \n\nWhen do we schedule the meetup at ICA Yerevan?", "created_at": "2019-03-18 11:57:35.287199", "updated_at": "2019-03-18 11:57:54.411811", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 40, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [51721], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32099, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3675, "post_number": 25, "raw": "<b>Notes from the session now online- please add your own!</b>\n\nPlease add the notes for the third group if you were in it :)\n\nHere we go:<a href=\"http://https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote4/notes-from-the-lote4-session-on-learning-to-learn-about-futures\"> https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote4/notes-from-the-lote4-session-on-learning-to-learn-about-futures</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-01 12:13:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:56.414650", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 71, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16671, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3266, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>From one community manager to another</b>\n\n@Hazem it's very sweet of you to share this and I hope this is just the beginning of our work together.\n\nI was telling you in Tbilisi how lucky it felt to have you on board and how you seem to have a natural ability for community management. \u00a0Here is the <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-dev-testing/331/edgeryders-community-managers-manual\">Edgeryders manual </a>I've started and will keep on updating over time.. if sometime in your process of figuring out where you wanna go next you'd be interested in doing this for the longer run, get in touch :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-12 12:16:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.259638", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 116, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15957, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 2239, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Welcome on board!</b>\n\nHey Lindy, great to meet you, and great input as well. Just a few quick thoughts by me:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Local knowledge.</strong> I agree wholeheartedly on your proposal of replicating the unMonastery concept in African cities. It all critically depends on the input of changemakers and innovators in the local population. Even when it might all still be called \"Edgeryders\", I think we European Edgeryders don't have much to offer, as we don't know the specifics of problems in Africa and how to solve them. But we are eager to learn, and also would be more than happy to come over and help out with some tech and organizational know-how where it's desired. (For example, I work on a huge collection of free and open source physical products for all areas of life, calling this <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/earthos-0-13\">EarthOS</a>.)</li>\n\n<li><strong>System D.</strong> In my understanding, one thing is much better for \"changemakers from the edge\" in (at least many) African countries than it is in Europe: you don't have to ask so much for permission. While in Europe, all economic and other activity is heavily (over)regulated, the ubiquitous informal economy (\"system D\") in many African states is just the opposite. Maybe that's something to take advantage of when applying the unMonastery concept to African cities: I guess it should not be that much of a multi-stakeholder approach with instiutions, academics, government etc.. More like just getting together and starting to get things done, making agreements and collaborations only when attracting some attention with the provided solutions ...</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIf you want to create Edgeryders Africa, please just go ahead :) No need to ask for permission for anything. You can get a dedicated area of this website for it as well (either a group such as this one, and / or a \"minisite\" that looks more like a traditional homepage). You can contact me if you need help with that, since I'm kind of managing the tech of this website.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-02 02:33:47", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:44.431092", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 359, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60079, "user_id": 5025, "topic_id": 9881, "post_number": 60, "raw": "Yes I did.

The closest you can get by train is to <strong>Bari </strong>Central Station, and then take the famously slow, though pictoresque <a href=\"http://ferrovieappulolucane.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FERR24062013.pdf\">trains</a> of the Ferrovia Appulo-Lucana (<a href=\"http://ferrovieappulolucane.it/en/\">FAL</a>). The FAL run regular trains, every 1 and a half hours (around 12 daily), ticket is 4\u20ac. They take about 90 minutes to Matera and don't run on Sundays, when they are replaced by some buses leaving from behind the railway station (UPDATED!). Another option is to go through Potenza and Ferrandina on national railroad, but from <strong>Ferrandina </strong>you will have to hitchike. \n\n**By bus:**\n\nBuses are a really good option: <a href=\"http://www.marozzivt.it\">Marozzi </a>runs daily buses to and from <strong>Rome </strong>(32,50\u20ac, every 6,5h), <strong>Siena</strong>, <strong>Pisa </strong>and <strong>Florence</strong>. Booking in advance is essential. <a href=\"http://www.sitabus.it\">Sita</a> links Matera to Taranto, Metaponto and other small towns of the province. <a href=\"http://www.marinobus.it/\">Marino </a>links Matera to Milan, Bologna, Naples, and many foreign cities. \n\nTip: check with @elf_pavlik (English, German, Polish) or @ilariadauria (Italian, English, French), we might be able to help you with the last leg of your journey. Elf, an experienced sharer and hitchhiker, will also help you organize cheap or free travel from wherever you are to \\#LOTE3.\n\n\n## Accommodation\n\nMatera is a tourist city: there's plenty of reasonably priced accommodation. We are crafting deals with local b&amp;bs for people which stay 3-5 nights or 5-7 nights. <a href=\"/t/lote3/312-logistics-team/accommodation\">Here </a>you will find the updated table with the deals. You will then have to make reservations by yourself, teaming up with at least another ER as rooms are double. Mention to the owner that you are coming from Edgeryders. Please bear in mind that most of these people are looking forward to meet you, so when you arrive do not hesitate to explain what brings you to Matera and what you are curious. \n\nSome generous Materans have offered to host \\#LOTErs in their homes: because they believe in the project and want to give their support through hospitality, but also because we have involved personal contacts: do not hesitate to bring something in exchange (Materani love to discover products from other territories!). Also, we hope you will understand that priority will be given to Edgeryders that have been contributing to the making of the LOTE3 by volunteering. Once you make your reservation, please remember to mark it in the table, so we know how things are flowing. \n\nThere is a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/search/more/?q=Couchsurfing+Matera&amp;init=public\">couchsurfing </a>community in Matera, as well as another very interesting platfrom called <a href=\"http://www.angelsfortravellers.com/site/en/index\">Angelsfortravellers</a> (tips, hospitality, meeting the locals): this is another channel to get accomodation and promote the LOTE3 event! \n\nGet in touch with @ilariadauria for further information you might not find on this platform!", "created_at": "2013-07-27 16:34:42", "updated_at": "2019-06-22 16:13:15.704373", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 624, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49011, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 9238, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Right.

It aims to offer hosts and participants a local/global platform for conversation and access to useful information and support which tends to be unavailable or expensive. For six months, one question per month will convene artists, activists, cultural workers to a local meetup (a community space, a cafe, or even a living room) where they will engage in constructive conversation and draw points of action for mutual support and collaboration at the equivalent of 3 hours / person / month. The meetups are synchronized to address complementary issues.\nMembers of the Edgeryders Culture Squad take turns to produce and document the events, connect the local stories into a bigger narrative, and connect participants with resources from our network of thousands of people doing cultural work.\n\n![culture%20Culture_all|560x315](upload://hlH5gGZ3DQaaU27QSbB5A8HlH3F.png) \n\n## **Conversations Format**\nAn afternoon/evening on a chosen topic, at a table conversation with 12-15 participants and possibly one or two guests acting as conversation openers.\n\n1. Invited guest introduces the inquiry and launches reflection points for the room.\n2. Participants offer their personal experience and asks for help as contribution to the theme.\n3. The group works together to build a set of actions for collaboration that require no more than 3 hours of work and service by each person who wishes to remain connected to the group.\n4. Hosts document the discussion into online posts and commit to connect it to other city events.\n5. *Dinner and drinks\n\n**The first season of Networked Culture Conversation culminates with a community event: A Performative Dinner to share key findings and celebrate outcomes as we plan for the future.**\n\n## Starting topics for 2019 \n* [What is an artist place to work from?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/culture-culture-berlin-2-artist-run-spaces/10119) in Berlin\n* [What makes a sustainable work space for collectives?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-makes-a-sustainable-work-space-for-collectives-in-brussels-see-you-on-1-may/9771) in Brussels\n* [How can arts and culture create a secure environment for artists and citizens to take the lead in the ongoing renovation of civic spaces?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/after-the-1st-session-notes-from-bedford/9918) in Bedford.\n* [How to use vacant spaces for social innovation?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/culture-culture-11-october-how-to-use-vacant-spaces-for-social-innovation/10887) in Brussels\n\n## Benefits for participants:\n* Join a process for discovering progressive ways to improve your work in Culture and the Arts!\n* Receive high quality materials about the solutions others have found in their city\n* Your project and plea featured in a global community of 4500+ like-minded and supporting peers working in culture, on [https://edgeryders.eu/culture-squad ](https://edgeryders.eu/culture-squad)\n* An invitation to join our Performative Dinner in one of the cities, closing the first season of our conversations.\n* Good food, drinks, and dinner talks.\n\n## Benefits for hosts and producers:\n* Build a tight community and make it a resource for new work, projects, collaborations\n* Become a cultural network node in your city.\n* Learn about community building using an online platform and digital conversation techniques\n\n## Where?\nWe start with Bedford, Berlin, Brussels, Yerevan and Athens. \n\n## How to start?\nA member of the Culture Squad team or Edgeryders community partners up with an active local group or organisation and asks them to co-host the event.

EXPLORE. DISCUSS. LEARN. CONNECT. BUILD. CELEBRATE.**\n## _19-23 November, 2019_\n**In a nutshell:**\n\nThe edgeryders festival is a program of activities that take place in multiple cities.  Tickets are not free of charge, but they cannot be bought for money. You can only get a ticket by working with the other participants to make it a great experience for everyone involved.\n\nThe festival consists of conferences, workshops, exhibitions in a program co-curated with participants around a number of overarching themes. Themes are proposed by the festival management crew and participants are invited to refine/improve them in an open process.  \n\nAs a community of over 5000 members in 80 coutries It is important to us that the festival is inclusive, accessible and useful to every single participant - no matter where they are located. We offer support for anyone who wishes to set up local events in their city as part of the festival program.*\n\n**Our objectives:**\n* add #1\n* add #2\n* add #3\n\n<br>\n\n\n_* **You should set up a local festival event If**: you want to make your local community discover, share and build creative solutions to local issues inspired by what has worked for other participants in other places - do consider setting up a local event as part of the festival program. Here is how:_\n<hr>\n\n## THE FESTIVAL PROGRAM :\n**The Edgeryders festival is a cocreated event.**  It is built by participipants who work together in different crews. Each crew is responsible for one main task needed to make the event from program curation to cooking and cleaning. Project management and coordination support is provided by one dedicated crew as a service to all the other crews. We set up the working and event schedule so that everyone can participate in the activities they want to before, during and after the festival, no matter which crew they join. \n\nAll program content is contributed by participants. The program is curated around a number of themes, each approaching from a different angle the question of how we build good lives for ourselves and others today and in the near future.\n![07|690x434](upload://s9oHjBtCoM3qr8YgS2pNdGgsFSR.png) \n\n<br>\n\n\n \n**Invitation text: (to be crafted by the team, this is just to get us going)**\n\n# ****What would you like to build, explore or learn during the Festival?****\n\nWelcome to your Europe. \n\nIt's a work in progress, the story is a tapestry woven by all of us, the invisible threads that weave our lives together. Our hopes and dreams, our fears and struggles.\n\n_**add paragraph highlighting promising developments in different parts of the continent**_ \n_- Romania- dealing with corruption. Czechia- economic development. Poland - add something positive here. Serbia - add something positive here. Germany - something here to. Italy- add something here. France - add something. Sweden - add something. Belgium - add something._\n\n_**add paragraph introducing the major challenges (our track themes)**_\n_Psychological and moral wellbeing. Work and prosperity. Health and social care services. Climate and environment. Internet Technology._\n\n## At the Edgeryders festival you get to see what is happening, and how your own story is part of it.\n\nYou will meet people from all over Europe to share our experiences from trying to build good lives for ourselves and people we love. Everyone comes together to exchange experiences, and use the learnings to help us make better decisions. In our professional and personal lives.\n\n![40|690x394](upload://3reqFP5NbL5kXoDi1ERvvsGexIP.png) \n\n\n\n## The Edgeryders festival a no-spectators event\n\nAll content is contributed by participants. The program is curated around a number of themes, each approaching from a different angle the question of how we build good lives for ourselves and others today and in the near future. \n\n**The festival is built by participipants who work together in different crews. Each crew is responsible for one main task needed to make the event. We set up the schedule so that everyone can participate in the activities they want to during the festival, no matter which crew they join.** \n\nEach crew coordinates its work through video chats that happen once a week. You do not have to be experienced to join a crew. It is enough to be interested and willing to put in a bit of work. The crews are : \n\n* Welcome team\n* Program Curation\n* Exhibition production\n* Party organisation\n* Design\n* Photos and videos\n* Tech\n* Logistics \n* Coordination\n* Communication\n* Documentation\n* Cooking\n* Local connectors\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n## Registration \n**To get a ticket:**\n\nIt is easy.\n\nYou let (add handles for the community managers) know a little bit about yourself so that our welcome team can connect you to the right crew. \n\nDo not worry about \"getting it right\" or if you feel unsure about how you can contribute - - we fill find something that is meaningful _and_ fun for you to do! \n\n If it is interesting and important to you, chances are it will be to someone else.\n\n## WHY IT IS WORTH THE INVESTMENT OF TIME & EFFORT:\nPostivie Outcomes for participants as a result of having joined our previous events:\n\n* Quote/ Video\n* Quote/ Video\n* Quote/ Video\n\nAfter years of experimentation we have a solid framework for Edgeryders events that are designed to accommodate a diversity of participants, themes and objectives. \n\nThis edition would be adding some elements from [OSCEdays](https://oscedays.org/) another format developed by @sammuirhead & crew which in turn itself drew elements from Edgeryders event formats  )\n\nWhat people said about the most recent event:  we have coordinated that follows Edgeryders methodology  (<a class=\"attachment\" href=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/76956ade79e5a56c0668c54326f556761cbd7177.pdf\">You can download the full festival report here</a>) :\n<br>\n\n![29|690x388](upload://iSLPjnsvtIDwPZsdUI9VamZB7vB.jpeg) \n\n![04|690x386](upload://fEttTeGCs4QIdsmfNZhoUSH7nGn.jpeg) \n<hr>\n\n## WHO ARE THE ORGANISERS\n<hr>\n\n\n## HOW IS THIS FESTIVAL FINANCED\nWe get support in the form money and in kind support from our official partners, as well as a number of project grants from the European Commission. \n\nOne grant is for a research project that aims to understand why we are seeing so many destructive political responses to societal challenges in Europe. And what the collective intelligence of the citizens tells us about how to best resolve the issues that cause them. Another is a grant tied to a program that explores how Europe can use, build and sustain the next generation of internet technologies so that they contribute to improving, rather than undermining, the wellbeing of citizens on the continent. \n\nThe information collected from the discussions on the platform and the documentation from the event are processed using open source technologies, turned into visualisations that  presented to the community for collective analysis and interpretation, then included in reports that are delivered to the funders. Everything is published and freely available here on the platform. \n\nBelow are links with more detailed information about the projects, the methodology and tools that we use to visualise what is coming out of the conversation as well as how we handle your data:\n\n\n\n\n<br>", "created_at": "2019-07-23 16:33:00.099167", "updated_at": "2019-08-22 09:01:39.252288", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1149, "wiki": true, "reads": 22, "score": 214.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 137, 4096, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8631, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 656, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Have you seen the interview with Raul Krauthausen?</b>\n\nI read this and was reminded of the conversation with \u00a0@moriel, @lujia, @ChristineOehme and @Luise_Kr\u00f6ning about their product design project after this <span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"/t/interview-with-raul-krauthausen/660\">interview with Raul Krauthausen</a>.\u00a0\n\nThey are taking a different approach in asking how to create environments which are <span>\u00a0</span><span>\u00a0</span><span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"/t/inclusive-by-design-and-not-by-label/659\">inclusive by design and not by labe</a>l.\n\nSomeone mentioned a website with a map of the city as seen from perspective of someone who has to navigate it with wheelchair: where there are no-go zones etc. Insight: many barriers are completely invisible to anyone not affected by them.\u00a0They proposed some design intervention towards making barriers in a decentralised manner visible as a first step. My opinion: making barriers visible is great when you also have the means to do something about it then and there without too much effort.

The Consortium meeting provided an overview of responsibilities of each partner, particularities of each workpackage and the ways we can work together to foster the multidisciplinarity (rather than interdisciplinarity) which is the originality of our approach. Most of the presentations are available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1heCdqJ2yONFn8mFHq907TlDEzzOgoGl2). Some of them are still missing, but I will be updating the folder when we receive the rest and in the text below I'll point out to some more specifically.\n\nThe post is made as a wiki so please feel free to contribute! @alberto @noemi @john @natalia_skoczylas @amelia \n\n##Firstly, some technical points:\nJarrko Siren, our Project Officer from the EC (Research and Executive Agency) emphasized the fact that POPREBEL is one of the three projects who won the call and encouraged us to get in touch with the other two projects for possible collaboration and exchange of experiences because the approaches are quite different yet complementary: \n\n- one is [DEMOS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/219150/factsheet/en) - similar to our research methods but doesn\u2019t concentrate to a certain geographic area, coordinated by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences \u2013 Centre for Social Sciences and the other is \n- [PaCE](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/220191/factsheet/en) - more digital and quantitative research, coordinated by the Manchester Metropolitan University.  \n\nEC/REA will be measuring the success with several indicators from which the most relevant might be the **Open Access to publications and data** at no charge to the user. Types of data to be deposited is data needed to validate the results presented in scientific publications (\"underlying data\") and other data as specified in a **Data Management Plan** (DMP) @matthias @alberto. DMP is due in the month 6 \u2013 it requires describing as much as possible in the first version then updating during the project when we make decisions. It is quite technical (not narrative), addressed to the data mangers. There is an [online manual](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) from the UK Digital Curation Center \u2013  a tool for creating the DMP with guidelines through the steps, also possible to export in different formats, and a template from the EC that the UCL can provide. \n\nIf there will be any **changes** in previously agreed objectives, deliverables and milestones defined in the description of the action there are two possible cases: either it is a significant change (for example, a WP leader is different, or the tasks have to be redefined) it needs to be discussed but if the change is minor (it does not impact the role of partners) it just has to be explained in the reports. At least one person engaged in the project must be familiar with the **Annotated Model Grant Agreement** - we will be going back to it often - this will be my task in Edgeryders, so for all the questions about the rules and procedures you can come to me. \n\nThe reports and deliverables are to be submitted through the FTOP (Funding and Tenders Portal) \u2013 the coordinator will be given the access to it in January next year. POPREBEL has **54 deliverables and 9 ethic deliverables** \u2013 to be noted: the reviewers have to give opinion for all of them \u2013 so we shouldn't write longer than necessary. More about the deadlines and how things work from the administrative and project management side can be find in the [presentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d0Iqg2zQDN_V3yvACF4Cf2_re2Wo9cf9 ) by Silvia Gigli (UCL). \n\nMain current **ethical issues** are related to personal and sensitive data, data export / import, risks to participants, misuses = all needs to be explained in ethics deliverables (due end of April). The ethics review will be planned for June 2019. Find more about this in @Richard\u2019s [presentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18TDtW5lQKJKsfyd_lEkw7RQ6dmHyTXCa) \u2013 they are due in Month 3. Some of them will be adapted from the FATIGUE and the Edgeryders will contribute and incorporate the planned ethics strategy. @alberto  \n\nFor the effective **outreach** we are free to decide what is best for the project and create the right communication strategy @nadia. References to consult:\n\n-\t\"[Communicating EU Research & Innovation - Guidance for project participants](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/gm/h2020-guide-comm_en.pdf) \" and the \n-\t\u201c[Social Media Guide for EU funded R&I projects](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/grants_manual/amga/soc-med-guide_en.pdf)\u201d\n\nHelp will be needed with the **website** (it was commissioned and should be ready by mid-March) \u2013 the basic structure will be there but questions arose related to a decision of having a blog. Edgeryders\u2019 proposal is to use the RSS to write blog posts which can be then visible both on the website and the platform. Anyway, working out loud is equivalent and equally relevant as blogging so platform in this case is the right way to go. Some books and articles will be made available by the FATIGUE team and we should decide which **repository** to use.  \n\nEdgeryders should contribute and incorporate the outreach and communication strategy to the first version of the project\u2019s **Dissemination and Communication Strategy** \u2013 due in the month 3. \n\n##Some content related points:\n\n@Jan, principal investigator (UCL), explained what is POPREBEL all about in [his presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O8eKA0_AlA4nSFzNNc2lNW_ww_BVzdru/view?usp=sharing). First question discussed: how to achieve **multidisciplinarity**? This should be a joint effort of maintaining constant collaboration \u2013 we need to come up with a plan and ensure everyone is on board when it comes to using the platform. The aim is to create our own sub-networks that will hopefully emerge naturally across the boundaries of work packages. To understand populism we need to rethink the concepts and create several typical scenarios of economic, political, cultural and social factors. \n\nEspecially relevant is the synergy with the sister project **FATIGUE** \u2013 how to improve the exchange of knowledge and make better use of it? This is closely related to the dissemination question. Some of the events and meetings were already announced during discussions \u2013 it is important to save the date for the relevant ones so I will start a separate thread with the main aim of creating a comprehensive **calendar**.\n\nIn general, here are some of the main ideas, questions and reactions during the meeting: \n\n-\tThe idea of neo-traditionalism should be closely linked with the idea of culture (WP3). What is the direction that CEE societies are taking? Is there an alternative to liberal democracy and or alternatives to EU integration?\n-\tNew traditionalism is the approach taken to feel secure. The model needs to be re-defined throughout the project. Is it possible to create a coherent explanation of socio-economic tendencies in CEE societies through the concept of neo-feudalism? What is the territorial dimension of neo-feudal tendencies in CEE?\n-\tThe role of Edgeryders is important here to identify how people think, but focusing on present-future building rather than putting attitudes into concept boxes to explain them - @noemi \n-\tOne of the WP3 deliverables will be a glossary of basic concepts ideally contributing to the multidisciplinarity. Edgeryders can explore the meaning of populism and how the term emerges in conversations. \n-\tEconomic populism should be understood as a consequence rather than a cause. Economic insecurity is something Edgeryders can also investigate through conversations. \n-\tLikewise for WP6 \u2013 there is an opportunity of using the platform to consider different scenarios and responses. \n\n@noemi will be posting soon more details about the community building and management. \n\nAll contributions, thoughts and suggestions are welcome :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2019-01-24 15:05:00.942444", "updated_at": "2019-06-05 08:48:26.838834", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1265, "wiki": true, "reads": 15, "score": 223.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59409, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 10787, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Microsolidarity, as I understand it (which isn't a lot) is largely based around being part of a \"crew.\"  I like this notion and it reminds me of the beginnings of my journey, which started on a bus with a group - a crew - of around 8 people.

I've made some progress, but now I'm running into some issues that I'd like to check in with @melancon and @jason_vallet about.\n\n\n## What works\n\n* I've set up a new Neo4j database on AWS and installed the graphAware plugins.\n* [Fixed a small bug](https://github.com/aerugo/graph-ryder-api/commit/690ce9b0452fc78fdf5118eed2c2c399aa0437be) resulting from changes in the neo4j python package\n* Got the API and dashboard up and running locally\n* Found the right configurations to import the correct dataset from ER Discourse. All of the needed variables are not in the example config file, so that should be updated and documented.\n\n    ```\n    [importer_discourse]\n    abs_path = https://edgeryders.eu/\n    users_rel_path = administration/annotator/users\n    user_rel_path = u/\n    tag_rel_path = tags/\n    tag_focus = ethno-openvillage-mena\n    topic_rel_path = t/\n    posts_rel_path = posts/\n    codes_rel_path = administration/annotator/codes\n    annotations_rel_path = administration/annotator/annotations\n    admin_api_key = MY_API_KEY\n    admin_api_username = MY_USER_NAME\n    ```\n\n* Successfully ran the HardUpdateFromEdgeRydersDiscourse call to populate the new Neo4j database with ethno-openvillage-mena dataset. Just to demonstrate, here is a (slightly pointless) Neo4j cypher query showing the shortest path between me and the \"coffee\" tag:\n\n    <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d3aad1850e549932b8e97a648ab4c3380733c023.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"303\">\n\n* Dashboard conversation view renders correctly\n\n    <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6e0de9a634cd6a596ce70ed981601fd17d06c507.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"427\">\n\n\n## What does not work yet\n\nAfter this, I run into problems. Next step should be to ask the API to generate the graphs by querying the Neo4j database and create graph data files using the Tulip library. This is done by calling `api-url/generateGraphs`. This call seems to be successful, and files are generated in `data/tlp`  which look something like this:\n\n```\n(tlp \"2.3\"\n(date \"09-29-2018\")\n(comments \"This file was generated by Tulip.\")\n(nb_nodes 1958)\n;(nodes <node_id> <node_id> ...)\n(nodes 0..1957)\n(nb_edges 4198)\n;(edge <edge_id> <source_id> <target_id>)\n(edge 0 0 1951)\n(edge 1 0 1935)\n(edge 2 0 1914)\n(edge 3 0 1897)\n(edge 4 0 1896)\n...\n```\n\nHowever, going to the Detangler View just renders empty views. On the backend, it looks like something has not loaded correctly, giving error traces ending in lines like this:\n\n```\n  File \"/Users/hugiasgeirsson/gitrepos/graph-ryder-api/routes/tulipr/tulip_layout.py\", line 25, in get\n    private_gid = self.gid_stack[public_gid]\nKeyError: 'usersToUsers'\n```\n\nThere are actually three of these errors, ending in KeyErrors for `usersToUsers`, `tagToTags` and `commentAndPost`.\nIt looks like there are supposed to be keys in gid_stack that aren't there.\n\nGoing to Code View or Code View Full simply ends up crashing python. Here's all I get from the terminal before it crashes after going to Code View:\n\n```\n\"GET /count/post/1443549843638/1538244243638 HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n\"GET /users HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n\"GET /count/comment/1443549843638/1538244243638 HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n\"GET /tags/0/1538244243655/10 HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n\"GET /tags HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\nInitializing\nExport\n127.0.0.1 - - [29/Sep/2018 20:04:05] \"GET /generateTagDateGraph/2940/0/1538244243655 HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n```\n\nRight after that, python crashes.\n\nSome background about my setup. I'm running the Neo4j database on AWS, [having set it up with the template available on the AWS marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B071P26C9D).\n\nI'm running the API and dashboard locally, on OS X 10.13, running the API on Python 3.6.5.\n\nSo, @melancon or @jason_vallet, do you have any hunches as towards what might be wrong?

I don't drive it much though: 1600 km since I got it in 2015 (I had a different truck before). For me it's a house that I can move step by step and slowly, stopping to live in different places along the way, and then I use the bicycle to get around. I often put it at a friend's place as we collaborate in business matters \u2026 and I can access his car workshop when I have to.\n\n* Also see the [trucklife](https://ma.juii.net/blog/category/real-life/trucklife) category on my blog.

We have these calls so we get the stories out to me, so I know what is happening, and I can contextualize. \n\nFrom our call, one major theme stood out: that of moral and ethical leadership (thanks @nadia!). Morals and ethical leadership in the pedophile church scandal in Poland, morals and ethical leadership in the major corruption scandal by the Czech Prime Minister, and morals and ethical leadership in deteriorating larger political parties in Germany. \n\nSo, here's an overview of what we've discussed, including some more admin stuff to consider:\n\n@natalia_skoczylas mentioned a couple of new stories from Poland:\n\n* There are recuring topics around health, employment, young people self-employed, changing qualification, and care as well\n\n* A story of a man (?) with schizophrenia, who finished art studies, tried working in his profession, but couldn't find a job, because no one wanted to hire him because of his diagnosis\n\n* A story of a woman with multiple sclerosis, in which she describes the problems in regular and mental health care, and the existing gaps\n\n* Previous interesting posts are about women's post-natal struggle, especially those giving birth who are self-employed.\n\nWhat is keeping people up at night in Poland today are: elections in October and a church pedophilia scandal, (an independent journalistic film exposed the scandal). \n\n_Fun fact: the government has been defending th church more than church has defended itself. Reason: votes._ \n\n@Jirka_Kocian explained that in the Czech Republic (or Czechia? What do we prefer?), the main topic of conversation on the streets and over a beer is the Prime Minister's moral/corruption (major protests after corruption came to light), and to which extend this is relevant to society. \n\nAnother issues that has been growing revolves around \"the layers of material gain,\" as Jirka put it so poetically during our call. The socio-economic situation in the Czech republic means that, overall, people aren't doing so bad, but they aren't doing great either. Seeing the wealthy, makes your average joe wonder how they accumulated their cash. There's a feeling that the poor-rich divide is increasing. \n\n_Fun fact: anti-islam rhetoric is out, anti-corruption rhetoric is in!_\n\n@MariaEuler:  one of the topics that is playing its part in Maria's neck of the woods is the ad-based internet economy community call of which yours truly also took part. But besides this amazingly interesting discussion (I'm sure notes should be online very soon), Maria also dived into the Germany related issues in the \"happening right now\" section of the content curation call. My main take away is that the Germans are losing more and more trust in well-established political parties/institutions, and that as a result, there's an actual chance of having a Green Party Chancelor! \n\n_Fun fact: apparently apartment/housing rent caps are HOT topics in Berlin right now, even though it's the cheapest place I've ever rented, and I live in Tbilisi!_ \n\nOther things to keep in mind to push out, @noemi stressed: cultural event in brussels, june 28. \n\n Besides these calls, quick reminder to everyone to:\n\n1. Fill out the spreadsheet with most interesting stories, add snapshots\n\n1. Compose a bi-weekly post with a summary highlightinh interesting discussions and posts (mostly for newbies and yours truly). \n\nThank you all for a very interesting call and looking forward to the next one!\n\nIn the mean time, @hugi - thanks for sending me the two posts you wrote last week, I'll gladly edit them, but perhaps we should discuss what we want them to achieve (who are they for?). \n\n@anon82932460 - lets set up a call to discuss strategy?", "created_at": "2019-06-18 19:20:25.205962", "updated_at": "2019-06-18 19:24:39.223621", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 631, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 47.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4986], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61747, "user_id": 5444, "topic_id": 11135, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Cze\u015b\u0107, @natalia_skoczylas, dzi\u0119kuj\u0119 za mi\u0142e przyj\u0119cie. \n\nPytasz jak czuj\u0119 si\u0119 z wynikami ostatnich wybor\u00f3w.

Together with a group of young people here in Tarfaya we are working on founding a sports-cultural club in the town. This came from our discussions on how to develope our own town. \nOur goal is socio-economic one, so we envision building a surf camp in town together with providing language classes ( spanish, french) and of course teaching surfing as well we envision a small building with some tents or a camping site for tourists  and other surfers where we can also enjoy the desert, nature, and  local music. \n\nAll of us come from Tarfya, basically young people, some are working some don\u2019t have jobs and some students. We used to surf from a young age because we were born here and the sea is our place. There was an active old club here initiated in 2010 but stopped working in 2014 due to several problems, and now young people has no other activity to do.\n\nTarfaya as a town was developing very slowly, in the past there was not much happening here, we only had the harbour and fishing is what most of the population do. But since 2010 Tarfaya became part of some sort of municipality following the king of Morocco, some social projects appeared like this youth club, public facilities, football playground and so, but still unemployment is still very high here and a lot of young people with not much to do.  \n\nSo as a group we continued to surf and working now to target people from other cities to come visit and surf , teach the young people here surfing as a starting point to establish this new club. On the mean time Currently professional surfers use the beach as they have their own equipments. \n\nWe still need to have a meeting with the local municipality to get access to a piece of land to officially work from. Of course there are other  challenges that we need to figure out how to solve like financing the club, getting the equipment as they are expensive. \n\nBut in the end we are aiming to have a cultural-sports club here to celebrate our own culture ( from food, language, music) and a step to get young people out of unemployment.\n\n-------\n\nArabic Text Below.\n[text-direction=rtl]\n

It is a bit new for me and I have been lost between different emails- posts and facebook conversations , have been quite busy with the coordination stuff but without giving updates on what's actually going on , so here is my updates and a sum up for our call about the different tasks\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>for the informal events :\u00a0 </strong><a href=\"/u/ahmed_m_rabie\">@Ahmed M Rabie</a> is now organizing an event tomorrow night at CILAS , just a an informal meeting with some students and fellow and also with the other participants . , and learning from Vahgan , can we make like a movie screening after that or just a meeting in the tea room or on the terrace would be better ??\n\n<strong>the 2nd one </strong><a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a> already made a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/693183647394723/?ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming\">facebook event</a> about it , it would be after the workshop , place not defined yet my suggestions coffe place \"ahwa \" in downtown or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kafeinegypt\">Kafeine\u00a0 </a>(have never been there it opened after I left Cairo but it seems nice) or Elzamalek also is ok ,,,,,,,,,,,,,, anyway I think the particpants with ahmed and nadia can decide</li>\n\n<li><strong>translation of the instructions\u00a0 </strong>I will be working on that today , expect an email from me with the arabic text tonight, before sending it to the list of participants</li>\n\n<li><strong>about the list of participants\u00a0 </strong>till now the ones who actually participated on the platform are only these <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgjW8VEw9pezdGM2YnhhcUx0NjRRMlFURVR5aHZlTkE&amp;usp=sharing#gid=2\">12 </a>am I missing some others , and also <a href=\"/u/gazbia_sorour\">@gazbee sorour</a> u told me that some people are waiting for the invitations , I don't have there emails can u link me with them or may be invite them and update the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgjW8VEw9pezdGM2YnhhcUx0NjRRMlFURVR5aHZlTkE&amp;usp=sharing#gid=2\">spreadsheet </a>,</li>\n\n<li>another thing : may be some people would show up as it is an open event on the facebook , so we need to prepare for that . and some others we are already in contact with them , they are still not on the website as It is somehow hard to deal with on the first time\u00a0 SO if they didn't post tonight shall I invite them and make\u00a0 a post giving a brief about them or what ?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 we already discussed on the call that may be inviting them to the informal event and shoot interviews with them .</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"/u/gazbia_sorour\">@gazbee sorour</a> and <a href=\"/u/maria_tarancon\">@Maria Tarancon</a> do we offer any kind of accomodation if needed , for the people who are outside cairo we only have Maged butter till now from alexandria</li>\n\n<li><strong>event logistics\u00a0 </strong>as we discussed in the call and trying to learn from Armenia and Georgia , we need someone to shoot videos I think this is <a href=\"/u/ahmed_m_rabie\">@Ahmed M Rabie</a> , someone to take good photos may be Ahmed can bring a friend , someone with the phone to get the late or lost people as it is hard to know that Ice cairo is in the first floor for the people who come for the first time , and Finally someone we can follow on twitter to share the updates on real time , I think the team will meet tomorrow morning so we can assign these tasks</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\u00a0\n\nfrom the people\u00a0 I am in contact with right now if they had difficulties to show up her or on the workshop there is at least someone we can shoot an interview with he is from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLBgLM1hvOY\">Kintrans

this migration happened in a moment and in a way which coincides with a set of thoughts I had recently.\n\nIn the last few days, I  was coming back to these pages because I finally started working again on my community-based project, a bunch of other code experiments with potential, in terms of social innovation, and the **Edgesense Dashboard** (I will expand on this in a separate thread, later).\nThat's where I noticed that changes were happening and I guessed that something big was about to happen :slight_smile: (you probably discussed this for quite some time on ER but I was away for a while...)\n \nAt the same time, while reworking my website, I've been researching on a variety of platforms and tried to figure out the freshest approach to online communities: which solution would deliver a smooth user experience, while remaining focused on (rich and diverse) contents?\n\n----------\n\n**Discourse** is definitely a great application and I praise your choice.\nAlthough I was tempted to adopt it too (and I'm literally copying many of its features, to present bbPress discussions) I had a few reservations which, as of today, are still unsolved: customizing the platform to work more as a CMS and/or a social network seems quite hard to me. Especially when gathering etherogeneous contents, like custom page types and implementations, it definitely feels much harder than many alternative (more established and dedicated) solutions.\n\nRecently, I read these:\n\n* https://meta.discourse.org/t/has-anyone-created-a-news-site-using-discourse-as-a-cms/63646\n* https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-can-i-implement-a-blog-page-in-discourse-forum-software/48496\n* https://meta.discourse.org/t/community-forum-vs-community-cms/24956\n\nThe last thread also pointed to this article:\nhttps://blog.erlend.sh/foundation-re-defined-going-back-to-specialised-applications-a197f3e799e7\nwhich I guess is more relevant to me than to ER but still it makes a point which I believe is worth discussing: what is the optimal balance between seamless UX, specialization of contents and features, ease of development?\n\n----------\n\nAnd this is why I'm posting here today.\nI'm aware that the ratio between pure conversation and \"special\" contents on ER is substantially different than what I'm aiming to. Still, if any conversation might exist on ER with regards to the above, I would love to read it.\nIf not, I'd be keen to know if anyone's interested in having such a discussion.\n\nI understand this is quite a long, very specific reply for a **Help &amp; Feedback** topic but, hey, this is **Discourse**: you can definitely move this to the most appropriate topic/category if there's a better place for it :)", "created_at": "2017-07-22 18:10:46.857614", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:04.379338", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 474, "wiki": false, "reads": 41, "score": 63.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58596, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 10626, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Thank you very much!", "created_at": "2019-08-30 08:50:39.527506", "updated_at": "2019-08-30 08:50:39.527506", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 7.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58583], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68677, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 12240, "post_number": 5, "raw": "[quote=\"dnllvrvz, post:4, topic:12240\"]\nI\u2019ve been excited about BBU since the first time I heard about it.

The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has changed our immediate daily lives but it will likely have lasting effects, too.\n\nAn interesting story in The Atlantic [this](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/pandemics-plagues-history/610558/) week explores how pandemics have previously impacted society and economies. It talks about how the Black Death that swept across Europe between 1347 and 1350 resulted in a huge loss of lives - particularly among children.\n\nThis inevitably led to a shortage of labour and farmers in Northern Italy began to increase their wages to attract workers. A middle class began to develop and the region became more affluent.\n\nLike previous pandemics, Covid-19 will change our societies and economies. While we won\u2019t see some of these changes until further down the line, others are more apparent.\n\nPerhaps one of the more obvious is the move to remote working. While many companies and employees were beginning to adapt to this model in recent years, they still made up a small proportion of the entire workforce.\n\nWith the pandemic, employees based in offices have been forced to work from home, and those who were more cautious to this style have seen its merits. The crisis has propelled a definitive move to remote working for many; even major tech companies that were previously \u2018office-centric\u2019 are now fully committed to the model.\n\nEdgeRyders has operated as a remote workplace since launching eight years ago. We have an entire section of our website dedicated to distributed collaboration [here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/coworking-distributed-collaboration) and have put together a book on how to establish a remote business or organisation, which you can find out more about [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-journey-to-the-distributed-business-future/13243).\n\nWith more people working from home and logging onto the internet to access their work network, it is likely that issues surrounding internet governance are more pressing than ever.\n\nWe have been discussing what the future of the internet looks like and one of our members wrote an interesting suggestion on [this thread,](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-internet-governance/13818/4) saying that CMU researchers have suggested IoT gadgets should have privacy labels (that look pretty similar to an energy label that would comes with an electrical product a consumer may buy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just work and our new behaviours surrounding the internet that will change because of the pandemic. The crisis has also shone a spotlight on inequalities - and in cases exacerbated those inequalities - in our societies. People are demanding change to these old unfair systems on which our societies have been built.\n\nThere have been conversations on EdgeRyders about how we can support the movement for racial justice in the US. This week, [some of our members ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/support-the-movement-for-racial-justice-in-the-usa/13794/14) have added to that conversation and highlighted that Europeans are quick to condemn the States for its racist systems and behaviour but are less critical in analysing our own systems of inequality. Please join in the conversation\n\nFood for thought\n\nWe are organising a coworking summit that will be further delving into topics discussed in this newsletter on 21st July. While on 22nd June we have a[ pre-summit session](https://edgeryders.eu/t/session-on-endangered-researchers-and-precarity-in-higher-education/13414), where we will be talking to higher educational experts, policymakers, unionists, human rights defenders to discuss challenges facing those working in academia.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nOne of our members is looking for a senior developer to take over as Chief Technology Officer at an edtech start-up. If you\u2019re interested, take a look [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/community-friendly-edtech-startup-you/13853).\n\n\n\n---\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Nn0myYpwDUw\n\n### Join Edgeryders\nSign up [here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/campfire) to: \n* \ud83d\udcac Find the right conversations \n* \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f Get invitations to our events\n* :open_book: Learn & build new knowledge \n* \ud83d\udee0 Co-create new projects and programs\n\n\n\n</Text>\n</Content>\n\n---\n\n<Content id=\"Support our work\">\n<Text>\n\n##  You can help.\n\n**Get in touch.** Edgeryders can support the work of changemakers in more than 80 countries because people like yourself support us with knowledge, contacts and resources.\n\nContact us on [Email](mailto:nadia@edgeryders.eu)  /  [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/JawU61gzONdIftzzvAyvUg) \n\n \n\n\n</Text>\n\n</Content>\n\n---\n\n</Webkit>", "created_at": "2020-06-21 07:31:45.206844", "updated_at": "2020-12-15 20:03:19.978259", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 803, "wiki": true, "reads": 11, "score": 17.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77742, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13700, "post_number": 22, "raw": "[quote=\"amelia, post:5, topic:13700\"]\n@alberto can stay, as I still have big plans to transform him into an economist-anthropologist\n[/quote]\n\n\nHell yeah :mage:", "created_at": "2020-05-29 16:10:25.703049", "updated_at": "2020-05-29 16:10:25.703049", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 17.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [77672], "is_reply_to": [77672], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62353, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 166, "raw": "The issue persists, and the problem is somehow that if there's an error, even if you go back or fix whatever was missing (i didn't put the age first and tried submitting it), the form will keep on showing the error and you can't submit it anyway... \n\n@hugi - absolutely right, if it's possible, it would be wonderful, if not, we will have to live without it or i will maybe find extra little budget, if you could tell me how much it would cost to have a second language i will see if we have anything left\n\n ![51|690x428](upload://3DOvspxBVz5aHhYhf39HZnniUgS.png)", "created_at": "2019-10-28 08:57:48.889740", "updated_at": "2019-10-28 08:57:48.889740", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 106, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 27.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [62344], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55321, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 10059, "post_number": 16, "raw": "So in Google's case, if you sign in with them, they see your searches, know where you are, know you do or don't use their office suite, look at certain kinds of YouTube vids, etc etc, and they rioll that up into a much more valuable mega-profile.

The introduction of your note got me into it, since I definitely share and care about what's mentionned right here:\n> The infiltration of capitalist and colonial mechanisms of power and their effects is not a new challenge facing social-political leaders and engaged citizens. Nonetheless, the intersection of complex decolonial transitioning with the nature of digital innovation and flawed democratic apparatuses, calls in progressive and nuanced responses to open access for personal and collective autonomy.\n\nYour choice of semantic here also give a great picture of **how violent this field can be**. And, as a white male living in Europe, I'm definitely not the one that could give the best testimony of it...\nYet, as I read your prez, I feel we share common visions on how emergencies could be handled by local communities, on a global scale. And as you often imply in the note, **it might be a question of tools**, and how to get / build / have access to them.\n\n@SyMorin and I are currently trying to build a project around local food cycles. It's still at a too early stage to be shared properly here, but some of our inputs join yours:\n**MAPPING** => The fact that we need to map places and people, as a growing basis to gather energies, networks, communities, patterns, ...\n**PLATFORM BUILDING** => In order to show the datas collected and how everything is growing and moving forward. Also a good place to empower those who needs solutions, and organize a cause (wich comes with a manifesto of some sort).\n**SEMANTIC WORK** => Language can be a source of colonialism perpetuation, we all know that I presume. It is important I think to use the local terms and avoid any globalisation of semantics.\n**INTERSECTIONNAL WORK** => Cross topics workshops and think tanks might be a good way to transform intersections of causes into real and pragmatic connections, with everything that implies: solutions, structures, tools, etc.\n\nThere are quite others leads that could be taken as well, but basically, your note says it all for now.\n\nhow could we / I help more now?\nWhat's your next move?", "created_at": "2018-03-13 17:07:57.413640", "updated_at": "2018-03-13 17:07:57.413640", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 359, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 59.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51488, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9568, "post_number": 11, "raw": "So maybe we move it over there now and get going with it..?", "created_at": "2019-03-08 15:27:23.636261", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 15:27:23.636261", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 21.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [51487], "is_liked_by": [4970], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58598, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 10450, "post_number": 25, "raw": "Hello @BlackForestBoi, we will be able to explain the support for followup projects better in the call on Tuesday.\n\nAlso, @davidseoane shared this link and it might be interesting for you in this and general sense: https://www.ngi.eu/join-ngi/", "created_at": "2019-08-30 08:53:26.789272", "updated_at": "2019-08-30 08:53:26.789272", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 42, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 23.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58531], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10315, "user_id": 84, "topic_id": 1028, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>meetup</b>\n\nare there more of these? on one of my print outs it says *meetups every sunday, shortened to 1 hour so everyone comes at the same time.\n\n?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-20 20:46:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:59.450437", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 34, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66635, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 12063, "post_number": 11, "raw": "The problem of designing by consensus at this stage is we run the risk of delaying and or obfuscating the basic structure we need..

The overarching logic behind this development and acquisition is generally to enable the provision of public services. In recent decades this model has become overstretched: states have found themselves struggling to find the resources to keep those assets manned so that provision of such services could continue, and had to retreat from many non-core services. Consequently, many such assets lie unused; some are beginning to deteriorate.\n\nIn an effort to correct this situation, some public assets have been turned over to the private sector. This move has had mixed results: while some financial advantages for states have indeed materialized, at least in the short term, many privatization programs suffer unintended consequences. The general consensus seems to be that it might be interesting to explore new avenues.\n\nCommunities have been singled out as candidates for taking care of some public assets, in particular those that can be used to provide services to the community itself.\n\nThere is now evidence available to indicate that communities can indeed provide stewardship. The EdgeRyders community has itself accumulated significant experience in this area. We believe the ability to come together to take care of assets in an unstable context is a key skill for surviving and thriving in the future.</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<center>\n\n<h1>#LOTE4</h1>\n\n<h2>Stewardship</h2>\n\n<span>23-26 October, 2014\n\n(location t.b.c) </span>\n\n<center>\n\n<img height=\"auto\" src=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/lote4/unmonshot.jpg\" width=\"280px\">\n\n</center>\n\n</center>\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"tftable2\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th style=\"width:10%;\">\u00a0</th>\n\n<th>Day 1</th>\n\n<th>Day 2</th>\n\n<th>Day 3</th>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">08:00 - 09:30</td>\n\n<td>Welcome breakfast</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">09:30 - 10:00</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Fabrizio Barca</span>, General Director for Development at the Italian Treasury // <span>Ben Vickers</span>, unAbbot at the unMonastery</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Amelia Andersdotter</span>, Chair of the European Pirate Party// <span>Giulio Quaggiotto</span>, Pulse Lab Manager at UN Global Pulse</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>David De Ugarte</span>, Grupo Cooperativo de Las Indias // <span>Nadia El-Imam</span> Co-Founder and CEO, Edgeryders</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">10:00 - 10:30</td>\n\n<td>Coffee break</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"tftable2\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">10:40 - 11:05</td>\n\n<td style=\"background-color:#ffded8;width:90%;\">\n\n<span>Who are the key actors and trends in Stewardship?</span> Overview of the three parallel sessions</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"tftable2\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">11: 05 - 13:00</td>\n\n<td>Propose a session</td>\n\n<td>Propose a session</td>\n\n<td>Propose a session</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">13:05 - 14:20</td>\n\n<td>Lunch</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"tftable2\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">14:20 - 14:30</td>\n\n<td style=\"background-color:#ffded8;width:90%;\">\n\n<span>Unconference sessions:</span> Introduction to talks and workshops proposed and selected by participants</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"tftable2\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">14:30 - 15:30</td>\n\n<td>Propose a session</td>\n\n<td>Propose a session</td>\n\n<td>Propose a session</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">15:30 - 16:00</td>\n\n<td>Coffee break</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">16:30 - 17:00</td>\n\n<td>Plenary: Groups report back</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">17:00 - 18:00</td>\n\n<td>Propose a session</td>\n\n<td>Propose a session</td>\n\n<td>Propose a session</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">18:00 - 18:30</td>\n\n<td>Plenary: Groups report back</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"tftable2\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">18:30 - 19:00</td>\n\n<td style=\"background-color:#ffded8;width:90%;\">\n\n<span>What have we learned?</span> Wrap up of the discussions</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"tftable2\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">19:00 - 20:00</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Juha Van\u2019t Zelfde</span>, Artistic director of Lighthouse in Brighton //<strong> Eric Osiakwan</strong>, Technology entrepreneur and investor.</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Rasigan Maharajh</span>, chief director of Institute for Economic Research on Innovation (t.b.c) // <span>Noemi Salantiu</span>, Founding Director and Community Mangager at Edgeryders</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Riel Miller</span>, Head of Foresight at Unesco// <span>Nadia EL Imam</span>, Founding Director and CEO of Edgeryders</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">20:00</td>\n\n<td>Dinner</td>\n\n<td>Dinner</td>\n\n<td>Dinner</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"tftable2\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\"><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times\" size=\"3\">22:00</font></td>\n\n<td style=\"width:90%;background-color:#ffded8;

She easily convinced me to join Webrussels, a movement to empower citizens to build the city they want. A few months later we ended up organizing &quot;Fearless Cities&quot; a 2 day festival on local democracy. During the festival, she said something that remained stuck in my mind for quite a while\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hearing the story of Sabine. 20 years in Brussels and still has a feeling of not belonging here.

Expats can live here in a world of their own and not connect with anything. When you come here as a foreigner you are so preoccupied with your career (and maybe with your family life), that there is no energy left to engage in citymaking . But I think that, for long term happiness, it is essential to feel that connection: to feel part of society in the city. \n\nMuch later, in October 2019 I met her and her partner Malcolm at a bar in Etterbeek and we had a nice discussion on housing, sharing and communal living in the city.\n![IMG_20191018_192637|690x517](upload://xwMl3MBYMzxoXuLEXVuszU3HHp6.jpeg) \nMalcom and Sabine own a house in Ixelles and live with their 2 children.\nSabine is german and works for an international NGO dealing with climate change issues. Malcolm is from UK and teaches math and physics at the European School.\n\n## Experience at the university of Durham\n**Malcolm:** I remember our experience at Durham University where I met Sabine at a residential college of academics, I liked the aspect that one had privacy and personal space but one could come together for meals, sports facilities, common rooms to enjoy each other's company and then withdraw again. We used the space to initiate social gatherings and also to facilitate professional academic interactions.\n## Connecting with the city\n**Sabine:** I think this Reef project could help for connection. Especially in situations like Brussels where a lot of people come here from abroad and do not have family networks. The Reef could be something to replace that.\n## Eating and music bring people together\n**Malcolm:** Common themes in my life that bring people together are eating, drinking and music. Music has been pretty much a glue that allowed me to join and unite thriving communities.\n## On the things we would like to share\n**Malcolm:** A garden, a greenhouse, a pool room, a swimming pool. We would also like to have a clothes drying space. We used to have a roof where we could put the clothes to dry outside. it was covered when it was raining and used to dry very fast when sunny. it was energy efficient. Now we have a tumble dryer. I hate this as an energy efficient person unless the reclaimed heat would be collected and used in other places. We are very lucky we have a music room, a study, a workshop for makers, but we don't have a garden.\n## Some sort of agreement that goes beyond pure logistic arrangements\n**Sabine:** I was never in a situation where I could choose a community to live together. I had different shared flat experiences during my university days. Those ecosystems were rarely designed but in my case it was more by commercial coincidence (they were looking for someone to join their apartment). If you were lucky you could end up in a context where people liked each other and we ended up doing things together. \n\nDuring those University days it used to work better when there was some explicit conversation on how one wanted to live together. What one wanted to share and what rules one wanted to adhere to: how and what to clean, who would shop and who would take the rubbish down. Without those basic agreements of communal living, conflicts would arise and not a solid basis to deal with those conflicts. \n\nWhat I would look for today is something that goes beyond the domestic arrangements, where there is the possibility for social engagement, common social life, common activities and maybe common cause around something: A contract to get involved as citizens in our neighbourhood.\n\nI don't want social control, I want a communal way of living. And what I want from that is a place of discussion about life in the city. And how the people that live in the community want to implicate themselves in the building of the city. Also join together and decide on some form of action, to be political beings to be citizens together.\n## Housing communities they have to be self selecting\n**Sabine:** They have to like each other and make an agreement on how to live with each other. But we should be careful not to be elitist projects becoming a same socio-economic group of similar wealth. I don't know how to solve all of the issues but there should be some social inclusion and material solidarity in a community housing project.\n\n## On how expensive is to build environmentally friendly houses\n**Malcolm:** We have a typical Belgium house. Narrow and tall. Spaces are distributed across floors. Very inefficient. We wanted to do radical environmental &ldquo;things&rdquo; to expand the rooms but we could not afford it. The project would be too large. It would be cheaper to destroy the house down and build a new one. I believe those saving could be done by normal people buying structures together.This makes it possible to have shared facilities that everyone can use. Making a high standard of living available to ordinary people. Environmental technologies should be not just for rich people.\n\n## On the burden of social life organisation\n**Malcolm:** There are economic attractions to live together: saving money or reducing impact on the environment. But the actual administration of communal living takes time: minutes, meetings.etc As a young guy I would be happy to throw my assets in there without thinking too much. But with my age, I have to be careful on dispersing capital to a project like the Reef because the risk of losing it all is big. The trust that has to be defined is Trust with capital T.\n**Sabine:** Time spent on living is reduced with my job. I love my job very much. I work a lot. I am aware that goes beyond the legal working hours. And sometimes I miss some communal living: more political decision making together with others (political design). But this requires time. Maybe living in a space like this would be an easier more efficient way to access that communal living that I miss.\n\n## Is this topic is interesting? \nWould you like to discuss it in a real physical event in Brussels in November 2019?

The Google-supplied client application does not cut it as it links Google Docs / Sheets / Draw files to their online versions rather than downloading exports. Last time [I figured it out](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/125118) with open source tools, but they had some bugs so I had to use other tools to check what they do \u2026\n\n* Making sure documents are not destroyed when exported from Google Docs / Sheets / Draw to LibreOffice formats. Because we can't get the Google formats natively. And at least in Google Sheets some functions are specific to their application, so you'll have to fix the formulas in the exports or your financial forecast spreadsheets etc. will be wrong.\n\n* There will be issues with duplicate file names resulting in clashes, because duplicate file names are allowed in Google Drive (which rather uses file IDs).\n\nLast time, it took me four days to migrate our stuff, and that was just from Google Drive to Google Team Drive (\u2026 and no, they don't offer a function for migrating from Google to Google). Like I said, it's better not to get locked in. Breaking out is hard work \u2026 :| \n\nAs for Juju and other automation interfaces for cloud services: they are great tools when there is a need for more than one server. But (caveat, little rant about to start): we don't have that need, nor will we have it for the next 10 years, so server instance management tools are an unnecessary layer of complexity. I hate Docker with a vengeance for the same reason. Besides other reasons, Docker makes it so easy to overlook all the details of setting up a server properly because servers are encapsuled into black boxes that you don't look into much. How many operators of Docker containers can assure that all of their containers have all of their security updates installed? Or just if all of them are configured to install security updates automatically?\n\nYears ago I used the Heroku CLI tool, one of the first tools like Juju. It started sweet and nice, but after 2-3 years that tool itself became so complex, causing problems everywhere due to corner cases, technological legacy and so on. It was a nightmare. We went back to one personally administered server and never looked back \u2026", "created_at": "2020-04-15 14:16:13.564285", "updated_at": "2020-04-15 17:40:34.014047", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 455, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 51.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [74393], "is_reply_to": [74393], "is_liked_by": [5025, 5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87263, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 14902, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Impressive.

Local unconf and the first mingling event will be created with the help of Swedish based foundations and local authorities.\n\nIf the first small scale projects will be successful, bigger projects can be created.\n\nWhat's left of the starting point:\n\n-Small scale local festival/the unconf with representatives of local business forums, successful lean startups, grass root no's and people willing to explore their ideas, but not yet sufficiently networked. \n\nWhere am I:\n\n- I will try to communicate between Edgeryders Main (as I named it) and the buzz around Edgeryders Local (as I named what has started here).\n\n- Get people I have met at LOTE to present on the events organized here. \n\nConclusion:\n\n- What I have pictured as Edgeryders Official Org, looks like growing Edgeryders Events Local Chapter. \n\nAny suggestions?

Mo\u017cemy cz\u0119sto us\u0142ysze\u0107, \u017ce praworz\u0105dno\u015b\u0107 jest zagro\u017cona przez rz\u0105dy prawicowych populist\u00f3w. Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 rozpocz\u0119\u0142o swoje od ataku na Trybuna\u0142 Konstytucyjny i s\u0119dzi\u00f3w.

Te ataki nie budz\u0105 specjalnego spo\u0142ecznego oporu. W Polsce pocz\u0105tkowo odbywa\u0142y si\u0119 du\u017ce demonstracje w obronie niezale\u017cno\u015bci Trybuna\u0142u Konstytucyjnego, ale szybko spo\u0142eczne emocje wypali\u0142y si\u0119. Wielu ludzi nie widzi w s\u0105dach gwaranta wolno\u015bci obywatelskich. Cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 postrzega je jako gwaranta status quo, a cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 wr\u0119cz uto\u017csamia wymiar sprawiedliwo\u015bci z dzia\u0142alno\u015bci\u0105 quasi przest\u0119pcz\u0105.

Okre\u015blenie \u201enadzwyczajna kasta\u201d zdoby\u0142o ogromn\u0105 popularno\u015b\u0107 i niemal natychmiast wesz\u0142o do powszechnego u\u017cycia.  Sk\u0105d tak wielka nieufno\u015b\u0107 do s\u0105d\u00f3w? \u017beby to zrozumie\u0107 musimy cofn\u0105\u0107 si\u0119 w czasie.  \n\nOd ko\u0144ca XIX wieku toczy si\u0119 sp\u00f3r mi\u0119dzy dwoma szko\u0142ami prawa. Obie reprezentuj\u0105 pewn\u0105 filozofi\u0119 i spos\u00f3b my\u015blenia o spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwie. Pierwsza jest zwi\u0105zana ze szko\u0142\u0105 austriack\u0105 i prawem pozytywnym. Rozumia\u0142a ono prawo jako zbi\u00f3r suchych i technicznych regulacji, kt\u00f3re maj\u0105 po prostu okre\u015bla\u0107 spos\u00f3b rozstrzygania spor\u00f3w. Druga szko\u0142a to szko\u0142a prawa naturalnego. Dla jej zwolennik\u00f3w prawo musi wyra\u017ca\u0107 interes spo\u0142eczny i naturalne prawa cz\u0142owieka. Szko\u0142a austriacka skompromitowa\u0142a si\u0119 wraz z doj\u015bciem Hitlera do w\u0142adzy. Ustawy norymberskie by\u0142y przecie\u017c legalne. Wydawa\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce ostateczny cios temu sposobowi my\u015blenia zada\u0142y ruchy praw cz\u0142owieka, kt\u00f3re doprowadzi\u0142y do podwa\u017cenia w latach 50-tych i 60-tych ustaw umo\u017cliwiaj\u0105cych  segregacj\u0119 rasow\u0105, czy karanie za homoseksualizm. Inne spojrzenia na ca\u0142\u0105 kwesti\u0119 mia\u0142 Karol Marks, kt\u00f3ry po prostu uwa\u017ca\u0142 s\u0105dy za jedno z narz\u0119dzi utrzymania bur\u017cuazyjnej w\u0142adzy. Rz\u0105dy prawa to po prostu rz\u0105dy bogatych ubrane w \u0142adne s\u0142owa. Prawnik i filozof Carl Schmitt twierdzi\u0142, \u017ce w prawie jest przed\u0142u\u017ceniem woli politycznej \u201esuwerena\u201d. To nie prawo jest \u017ar\u00f3d\u0142em w\u0142adzy, ale w\u0142a\u015bnie decyzja ludzi, kt\u00f3rzy powierzyli w wyborach prawo do reprezentowania siebie politykom. Oderwanie prawa od woli ludzi powoduje, \u017ce praworz\u0105dno\u015b\u0107 staje si\u0119 pustym s\u0142owem, kt\u00f3re nic nie znaczy. Schmitt i Marks zgodziliby si\u0119 zapewne z tym, \u017ce wymiar sprawiedliwo\u015bci funkcjonuj\u0105cy w granicach prawa mo\u017ce by\u0107 \u017ar\u00f3d\u0142em najwi\u0119kszego bezprawia. \n\nZazwyczaj prezentuje si\u0119 ostatnie trzydzie\u015bci lat jako sukces liberalnej demokracji i wolnorynkowej gospodarki. Je\u015bli jednak zgodzimy si\u0119, \u017ce sukcesy \u201eprawicowych populist\u00f3w\u201d nie wzi\u0119\u0142y si\u0119 z powietrza to musimy zastanowi\u0107 czy przyj\u0119ta przez nas optyka patrzenia na rzeczywisto\u015b\u0107 uwzgl\u0119dnia pe\u0142n\u0105 dynamik\u0119 proces\u00f3w spo\u0142ecznych i gospodarczych. Dlaczego ludzie buntuj\u0105 si\u0119 przeciwko \u201edemokracji\u201d i \u201epraworz\u0105dno\u015bci\u201d? Czy w 1989 roku nie zamienili\u015bmy jednej w\u0142adzy autorytarnej na drug\u0105 w\u0142adz\u0119 r\u00f3wnie autorytarn\u0105, ale ukryt\u0105 pod p\u0142aszczykiem indywidualnej wolno\u015bci? Czy dzisiejszy bunt mas nie jest po prostu buntem przeciwko systemowi, kt\u00f3ry z demokracj\u0105 i reprezentowaniem interes\u00f3w wi\u0119kszo\u015bci nie ma nic wsp\u00f3lnego? Przez ostatnie lata prawo w Polsce i na \u015bwiecie s\u0142u\u017cy\u0142o bogatym. Sta\u0142o si\u0119 narz\u0119dziem przemocy i pozbawiania praw. Prze\u0107wiczy\u0142em to dobrze na w\u0142asnej sk\u00f3rze.\n\n**Procesy o znies\u0142awienie** \n\nPrzeciwko mnie wytyczono \u0142\u0105cznie 22 sprawy s\u0105dowe o znies\u0142awienie. Wszystkie dotycz\u0105 spraw wa\u017cnych dla naszego kraju i spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa. Krytykowa\u0142em osoby publiczne: biznesmen\u00f3w, polityk\u00f3w i adwokat\u00f3w. W Polsce prawo dopuszcza z\u0142o\u017cenie prywatnego aktu oskar\u017cenia i cywilnego pozwu w tej samej sprawie. Ju\u017c raz zdarzy\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce s\u0105d karny uniewinni\u0142 mnie a potem s\u0105d cywilny skaza\u0142 w tej samej sprawie. Sprawy karne tocz\u0105 si\u0119 za zamkni\u0119tymi drzwiami. Oznacza to, \u017ce opinia publiczna ma du\u017co mniejsz\u0105 mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 obserwowania przebiegu procesu. Przegrana w sprawie karnej oznacza nawet mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 rocznej odsiadki. Zawsze takie sprawy oznaczaj\u0105 ogromne wydatki na prawnik\u00f3w i ogromny stres. Oskar\u017caj\u0105cy rzadko si\u0119 pojawiaj\u0105 na sali s\u0105dowej. Dzia\u0142aj\u0105 przez wynaj\u0119tych pe\u0142nomocnik\u00f3w, kt\u00f3rych zadaniem jest nie tylko sama wygrana, ale zm\u0119czenie przeciwnika. Ma\u0142o kto mo\u017ce sobie pozwoli\u0107 finansowo i psychologicznie na luksus prowadzenia kilku post\u0119powa\u0144 przed s\u0105dem. W ostatniej sprawie przegra\u0142em, bo s\u0105d uzna\u0142, \u017ce wyra\u017cenie \u201edzika reprywatyzacja\u201d oznacza oskar\u017cenia kogo\u015b o dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 przest\u0119pcz\u0105. S\u0105d skaza\u0142 mnie na grzywn\u0119 w wysoko\u015bci 5 tysi\u0119cy z\u0142otych i przeprosiny na jednym z wi\u0119kszych portali w Polsce. Ich koszt wyceniono na ponad dwie\u015bcie tysi\u0119cy z\u0142otych. Na grzywny nie wolno prowadzi\u0107 zbi\u00f3rek publicznych. W innej sprawie s\u0105d w\u0142a\u015bciwie nie by\u0142 wstanie wyt\u0142umaczy\u0107 dlaczego mnie skazuje na 15 tysi\u0119cy z\u0142otych grzywny wi\u0119c utajni\u0142 uzasadnienie wyroku. Ca\u0142a sprawa toczy\u0142a si\u0119 za zamkni\u0119tymi drzwiami a nast\u0119pnie s\u0105d zakaza\u0142 m\u00f3wi\u0107 o tym co go motywowa\u0142o do tak surowej kary. W razie uprawomocnienia tych wyrok\u00f3w b\u0119d\u0119 kryminalist\u0105 i to bez grosza przy duszy. Socjologowie i prawnicy m\u00f3wi\u0105, \u017ce takie pozwy maj\u0105 wywo\u0142a\u0107 efekt mro\u017c\u0105cy. Wys\u0142a\u0107 sygna\u0142 opinii publicznej, \u017ceby nie krytykowa\u0142a wp\u0142ywowych i bogatych.\n\n**Dzika reprywatyzacja**\n\nSformu\u0142owanie dzika reprywatyzacja, za kt\u00f3re zosta\u0142em ju\u017c  skazany, oznacza przekazywanie publicznego maj\u0105tku w prywatne r\u0119ce rzekomym spadkobiercom nie w drodze ustawy i rozwi\u0105zania systemowego, ale na mocy orzecznictwa s\u0105dowego. To w\u0142a\u015bnie s\u0105dy wymy\u015bli\u0142y i przeprowadzi\u0142y reprywatyzacj\u0119 w Warszawie. Polska jako jedyny kraj tej cz\u0119\u015bci Europy nie doczeka\u0142 si\u0119 uchwalenia ustawy reprywatyzacyjnej. W Warszawie na mocy tzw. dekretu Bieruta dosz\u0142o w 1945 roku do nacjonalizacji wszystkich nieruchomo\u015bci. Miasto by\u0142o w ruinie i chodzi\u0142o o jego szybk\u0105 odbudow\u0119. Zdziesi\u0105tkowani i zrujnowani w\u0142a\u015bciciele kamienic nie mieli takiej mo\u017cliwo\u015bci. Za znacjonalizowane mienie mia\u0142o przys\u0142ugiwa\u0107 odszkodowanie, kt\u00f3rego komuni\u015bci nigdy nie wyp\u0142acili. Na tej podstawie 50 lat po wydaniu dekretu rozpocz\u0119\u0142o si\u0119 uniewa\u017cnianie decyzji nacjonalizacyjnych. S\u0105dy administracyjne uzna\u0142y, \u017ce mog\u0105 takie decyzje eliminowa\u0107 z obrotu prawnego tak jakby przez te p\u00f3\u0142 wieku nic si\u0119 nie wydarzy\u0142o a te decyzje nie mia\u0142y nieodwracalnych konsekwencji. Otworzy\u0142y w ten spos\u00f3b puszk\u0119 Pandory. Dekret Bieruta sta\u0142 si\u0119 w XXI wieku prawem na podstawie, kt\u00f3rego dokonano przekazywania maj\u0105tku w prywatne r\u0119ce. S\u0105dy administracyjne z biegiem lat poszerza\u0142y grup\u0119 os\u00f3b uprawnionych do \u201ezwrotu\u201d nieruchomo\u015bci i ogranicza\u0142y mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 odmowy reprywatyzacji nieruchomo\u015bci. W ten spos\u00f3b ca\u0142kowicie przedefiniowa\u0142y kategori\u0119 interesu publicznego i u\u017cyteczno\u015bci publicznej. Po dwudziestu latach radosnej dzia\u0142alno\u015bci prawnik\u00f3w prywatne mog\u0142y sta\u0107 si\u0119 w Warszawie nie tylko budynki wielorodzinne, ale r\u00f3wnie\u017c szko\u0142y a nawet parki. W dodatku s\u0105dy uniemo\u017cliwi\u0142y w pewnym momencie uczestnictwa w procesach lokatorom kamienic. Pozbawiono wi\u0119c ogromn\u0105 rzesz\u0119 ludzi, kt\u00f3rzy mieli najwi\u0119kszy interes w tym, \u017ceby pilnowa\u0107 legalno\u015bci ca\u0142ego procesu, z mo\u017cliwo\u015bci zabierania g\u0142osu. W ten spos\u00f3b s\u0105dy wprowadzi\u0142y niejako dwie kategorie obywatelstwa, kt\u00f3re opiera\u0142o si\u0119 na w\u0142asno\u015bci. Lokator budynku komunalnego nie mia\u0142 prawa wyst\u0119powa\u0107 w swoim imieniu.

And I don't mean vacations either -- you neglect to mention fundamental improvements in people's lives since 1930 -- I mean, especially, health care and education, but also research, information services (which enable us to do this project altogether), and financial services. Financial services is the one we all love to hate, of course, but keep in mind that it is the means by which young people save money so as not to become inmpoverished old people. In the United States, for example, by far the largest investors in the stock market are pension funds. Also insurance, which enables large pools of people to avoid the consequences of disasters.\n\nActually I think Keynes was close to being correct. Average hours worked in 1930 were about 50 per week; in 2019 average weekly working hours (including vacations) in Britain are about 37 per week. But this is only for people in full-time jobs. I haven't done the specific math, but think of it this way: in 1930 in Britain the average longevity was 58 for men, 62 for women -- call it 60. In 2019 the average longevity for men is about 79 for men, 83 for women -- say 81. In 1930 there was no retirement age; but now the retirement age in Britain is 65 -- that means that retired people have on average 16 years during which they do not work at all -- that is a rather long vacation.\n\nMaybe Keynes was insufficiently generous.", "created_at": "2019-11-15 02:43:35.479415", "updated_at": "2019-11-15 02:43:35.479415", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 273, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 33.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70841, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 12781, "post_number": 17, "raw": "once we have the description of this type of workpackage and the tasks, we can also create a corresponding budget and agree on the minimum requirements under which we don't go.", "created_at": "2020-03-03 11:17:08.369231", "updated_at": "2020-03-03 11:17:08.369231", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 32, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 12.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [70825], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73235, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 12850, "post_number": 47, "raw": "I propose you can use the Discourse groups feature for that.

Anyway, I will share a few ideas and tips that you can implement, I hope these are useful for you.\n\n**Upcycling / Crafts**\n\nAll around the Sidi Kaouki beach there is a lot of trash lying around, this is caused by both locals and tourists and is very bad for the enviroment. So we went for a walk to pick up some of these trash and we decided to turn this garbage into new things, and so we did this workshops with the local children to teach them how they can use the trash that is lying around and turn it into something they can play with. Also kids will learn the value of these materials, they will be more aware and specially they will have a good time during the creative process and afterwards. By making something with their own hands they will feel empowered, creative and they will have a new toy,\n\nWe did clubs for juggling with used plastic bottles and bamboo sticks and wallets with used tetra packs, packs of juice and milk. Kids engaged immediately and we enjoyed a lot creating together, they were really focused and at the end they seemed happy and satisfied!\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8ec7be3d1df00c2a68147b52ed790083ba83f1a9.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b411be2729fa5028a1ed7c1af29cba9617c7d582.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3dc4761e9c1bac954d9a396e1749cbad0b1df711.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/89b98c631242583b0a4356e1ddedb31ae6c70879.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f1bc62cf0e8587b72e7770a99bf272d85f1741a7.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/81b046f412f590ce45e864f38025c16a7500d8d5.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\n\n**Mandala drawings**\n\nDrawing and painting a Mandala is a therapeutic activity, because the person who\u2019s making it focuses on the shape of the circle of Mandala and the details around it and enters in a state of serenity and concentration.\n\nIn order to do this with children start by showing them different examples of Mandalas and draw one yourself so that they can see what\u2019s it like. Then draw a small circle in a blank sheet and hand it to each one of them, and they\u2019ll pick up quickly, because Mandalas are archetypical images that belong to the collective subconcious, so everyone understands what they are, they\u2019re like flowers.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/af2b30b262e78b384e73d4f1d7d99c857143ba4e.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0d81c2d4b0dac6f978ca2ce2d53a644dc695f386.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\">\n\nKeep the creative flow!", "created_at": "2018-03-08 23:44:44.538008", "updated_at": "2018-04-04 13:13:29.371313", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 684, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 1030.0, "like_count": 16, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 8, 3782, 3729, 3791, 3, 4022, 4286, 5, 4357, 4041, 4, 2201, 3811, 3799, 1935], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49807, "user_id": 3180, "topic_id": 8833, "post_number": 4, "raw": "I love the fellowship model.

The idea for this service had come from a bunch of residents, some of whom were homeless, hanging out on the city's Public Electronic Network (PEN). At the time, of course, there was no Internet: PEN was a civic network accessible locally. SHWASHLOCK is the first public service designed on a computer network that I know of.\n\nSanta Monica's libraries had terminals connected to the PEN, and some homeless residents\u00a0were using the libraries. This is how homeless and homed residents were able to come to share a common hangout, and design together a simple, but very useful service.\u00a0\n\nIt turns out that online spaces are quite good at removing some of\u00a0the social markers that make interaction across social groups so awkward (and more power to you, @Laurent_d'Ursel , for overcoming that awkardness!). In the words of Donald Paschal, one of the homeless residents:\u00a0\n\n<em>\u201cPEN is a great equalizer. No one on PEN knew that I was homeless until I told them. After I told them, I was still treated like a human being\u2026 the most remarkable thing about the PEN community is that a City Council member and a pauper can coexist, albeit not always in perfect harmony, but on an equal basis.\u201d</em>\n\nMore info on SHWASHLOCK and its implications for public participation online:\u00a0http://www.cottica.net/2012/08/29/the-computers-of-the-excluded/\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-29 15:36:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:24.790885", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 281, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66367, "user_id": 5990, "topic_id": 12018, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Please mention the name / topic of the event you want to participate in, and the city or town where it is happening.**\n\nBerlin | Workshop on Service design in a climate emergency \u2014 What do digital services in a world of net-zero look like?\n\n**Work, hobbies, family life, leisure, pleasure...

I am a 28-year-old German-Nicaraguan designer. I grew up bilingually in Hamburg, Berlin and Mexico City. Instead of going to high school I completed a graphic design apprenticeship at the Lette-Verein in Berlin. Towards the end of my apprenticeship, I discovered service design and realized I wanted to do more than just designing logos and posters. Since then I've shifted to a more holistic approach, studied interface design at the FH Potsdam, did the Basic Track at the D-School and worked at Fuxblau for 4.5 years, a service design agency in Berlin Sch\u00f6neberg.\n\n**Great, now that you've made it easier for us to introduce you to the others \u2013 start to think about the topic and purpose of the event itself.

I stand by that panic is bad, and that it is real \u2013 hoarding masks and medical supplies are real and serious problems. Above all, we need to maintain societal order and cohesion. But we are in deep trouble here in Stockholm.\n\nAfter [sharing an infographic](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/09-03-2020/the-three-phases-of-covid-19-and-how-we-can-make-it-manageable/?fbclid=IwAR2QEeflZBH8LdCzl7-Nra_3x-vYkWD_u8Hcmc_Moz6X9bpjoVmgxGGIViA) three days ago, I got some pushback that I didn\u2019t really understand at first. Two friends thought that I was promoting complacency, while I felt I was promoting attentive but measured proactive behavior. One of them ended up unfriending me over it - even though we basically agreed on the major points. A very strong reaction and a strong signal should not be wasted. This led me down the path of spending eight hours last night getting even more familiar with the data, setting up my pipeline of data so that I could better understand what was happening. I looked at a lot of numbers, graphs, and plots. But what really hit home for me was a series of tweets from the ground, from a hospital in Northern Italy.\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/jasonvanschoor/status/1237142891077697538\n\nThis is what I am worried about happening in Stockholm. Doctors having to choose which life to save, letting some people die unattended because they are old or far gone. We can prevent this from happening by flattening the curve and keeping the load on our hospitals from breaking the system.\n\n**Countries that are prepared, like South Korea or Hong Kong, manage to keep fatality at 0.5%. When systems get overwhelmed, it is rather 5%. We can prevent 9 out of 10 deaths by being prepared!**\n\nThis estimate, and much more, came from a very insightful Medium post.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca\n\nAfter reading up for the last 24 hours, I came out with a changed understanding of the situation. I think there is no denying it - Covid-19 is going to hit us very badly in the next week or so.  Stockholm is likely to be very badly hit by Covid-19. Worse than most cities, by my predictions. In a 2 million people city, we already have around 250 confirmed cases, of the total 500 in Sweden. Out of those 500, only 35 were confirmed a week ago. Community transmission has been confirmed, and today we had our first death. \n\nIt is not looking good. It has been a well-known fact for a couple of years that our hospitals in Stockholm are already at full capacity and the regional government passed a budget earlier this year that cut funding further, no joke.\n\nEverything we can do to #flattenthecurve is paramount. And I can now better understand the pushback from those friends 72 hours ago, since they probably felt a lot of frustration towards what they felt was complacency. We should indeed cut back on contact, work from home when we can, practice social distancing, cancel public events and take plenty of other measures in the next couple of weeks.\n\nHowever, there is also a tone of \"blame the incompetent government\" and \"this useless society that will crumble at the smallest crisis\" in the Swedish discourse. This is directly counterproductive. Sowing distrust in public institutions is the _last thing we need_ when we might be about to face a crisis where it is paramount that people get accurate information. You may think they are incompetent, you may think they are wrong, but when your only response to that is to ignore what they say and trust what you read on social media, you are begging for chaos. We need to have faith, not because of authority, but in all of us as a society. We need to improve our cohesion and tune in to a common cause. That's how we beat this.\n\nI am also truly worried about how the distrust in society and everyone-for-themselves sort of bunker mentality will play out. I think that keeping calm but careful keeps us compassionate, and there are plenty of examples of how a crisis plays out when we lose compassion. The people I was arguing with didn't rate that risk as high as I do, and that is fair enough. I won't be smug about it though \u2013 the pushback of these two people made me spend another 8 hours looking at the data and reassessing the situation. Having a number of people in a society going very far is pushing the overtone window towards caution, and that is probably a good thing.\n\nSo what am I doing this week?\n\n* Last week I started plans to order 25 liters of ethanol and a liter of glycerol to make large amounts of hand sanitizer to hand out to people around me if stocks keep running out.\n\n* Started contingency plans for Noden, Blivande, and cancellation of all events I am involved in.\n\n* Washing my hands whenever I arrive somewhere.\n\n* Working a lot more from home.\n\n* Avoiding public transport when I can.\n\n* Going out less, a lot less.\n\n* Reading up, spreading the word. Especially making sure that friends and family in risk groups are well informed about the risks and developments.\n\nAnd because I find it soothing to really understand the data, I have set up my own real-time updated dashboard with calculations that I find relevant to keep track of. If you have any use for it yourself, go ahead. Among other things, I am keeping track of how Sweden is developing in comparison to Italy (disaster), Germany (systems still standing) and South Korea (reversed trend).\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1atFrVH6u4IPVezzzhqszDQH1QouvGJkalGySahh6j1A/edit?usp=sharing", "created_at": "2020-03-11 16:58:01.410176", "updated_at": "2020-03-28 17:35:23.221808", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1005, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 194.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 6285, 5252, 4795], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60416, "user_id": 5201, "topic_id": 10960, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Dear all, \n\n[here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-reef-visuals-first-proposal/10962/19) you can find a simulation that Lorenzo has done with the image @augusto bought and with an illustration - the \"polished\" image outcome of a first sketch like the one he proposed for SciFi Economics Lab. \n \nPlease, look at the two different results and express a preference between the stock image and the illustration.

together part of a grassroot effort to protect the 'frontliners' using their knowledge and expertise. \nThe current effort : making and supplying face shield masks for hospitals' 'frontliners' (nurses, cleaners, admin staff etc). \n\nThese face shields are for non-critical usage (those who work in infected area but not directly in the COVID 19 ward, e.g hospital administration, cleaners etc). For critical usage (those who worked directly with suspected/confirmed COVID patients) the professional shield masks are used.\n\nThe process involves sourcing the filamen to print the structure and a4 size transparent plastic as the cover. Some people offer disinfectent centre (using UV light or any methods available), sometimes these are done by the hospital themselves. The process is very organic. The 3D files are available to be download by anyone for printing. Local hospitals/clinics are contacted by local grassroot initiators to check for needs. Feedback received from the front-liners so far have been positive. The printed 3D structures are, at times being reused after disinfection while the A4 plastic covers are disposed. \n\nMalaysian 'frontliners' fighting COVID-19 have been undersupplied and sometimes they needed ad-hoc items to fill in the gap before the arrival of new supply. Thus, this grassroots movement has received good reactions from the health community. This simple solution helps reduce the burden of the frontliners,  easy and simple to be adopted by non-professional  and so far has reach to almost all 14 states in Malaysia. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/3195817283976982/?fref=nf", "created_at": "2020-03-25 13:27:58.631744", "updated_at": "2020-03-25 13:28:55.013486", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 267, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 48.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61113, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8582, "post_number": 89, "raw": "Yep.", "created_at": "2019-10-10 12:40:09.696998", "updated_at": "2019-10-10 12:40:09.696998", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [60966], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73361, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 13090, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-04-02 10:50:13.564756", "updated_at": "2020-04-02 10:50:13.564756", "deleted_at": "2020-04-02 10:54:26.728099", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51036, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9076, "post_number": 38, "raw": "I can't see any errors when I build the static site though, which I do by running 'npm run dist'.

More than 3,000 people attended the sessions each day. This huge event consisted of the Policy Conference (125 sessions); the Innovative Europe Hub for innovators, entrepreneurs and researchers mostly focusing on the EIC (European Innovation Council) Pilot; and the Science is Wonderful Exhibition showcasing impressive work of researchers funded under Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions and other EU funds. Our very own @MariaEuler was one of them, presenting her [Gallery of Quantum Teleported Artworks](http://mariaeuler.com/) and the interactive sculpture based on magnetism quite interesting to discover and experience. \n\nAt the opening session, the Commissioner Carlos Moedas compared the situation in 2014 when the words like \u201copen science\u201d were vague with nowadays when we refer to open data and open access as part of our European values. \u201cOpen innovation is about inclusiveness and disruption\u201d \u2013 his promise is to make the Horizon Europe a co-created enabling program. \n\nOne is true, this EU event was trying to be different in the sense that participants were given the opportunity to shape the priorities for the first phase of Horizon Europe implementation and help make sure it best fits the needs of citizens. This was possible through the Horizon Village \u2013 21 stands with the EU staff ready to discuss and listen to do's and don'ts for the specific policy topic. As Director-General of the DG RTD Jean-Eric Paquet said, the Commission is making an effort to change their usual way of working. :)  \n\nA few points from some of the sessions of the Policy Conference:\n\n* **Better services for project proposers** \u2013 the National Contact Points (NCPs) and the [Enterprise Europe Network](https://een.ec.europa.eu/) (EEN) discussed methodologies and services for participants.  EEN offers broad range of services for SMEs including building partnerships for Horizon2020 calls \u2013 it might be something we should consider in addition to our standard process of searching for partners. I\u2019ll also monitor their events as sometimes they also organize meetings for project proposers. EEN collaborates closely with the NCPs and in the future Horizon Europe they will try to improve their services based on the feedback from the researchers. Those in the audience complained the NCPs often do not have sufficient expertise and aren\u2019t of much use when it comes to answering more specific questions. @alberto  do you have any experience with the Estonian NCP (Estonian Research Council)?\n\n* **Preserving the EU values while harnessing digital progress** \u2013 (if we can actually agree on what these values are) it requires ecosystem collaboration - interdisciplinary approach going beyond the technology itself, human centric, data driven and trust based EU data economy. Eric Hardouin, the director of the Ambient Connectivity research domain of Orange Labs: \u201cthe EU policies could support the NGI vision by putting the public interest and societal value in front, together with the challenges, to create the trust framework on which the private sector can develop their data sharing policies\u201d.\n\n* **The promise of Citizen Science** \u2013 what is needed from governments, research organisations and others to maximise its potential? Wolfgang Burtscher (DG RTD): \u201cWe are convinced that the citizen science is an important tool to improve the science drawing on collective intelligence.\u201d It seems that in the new Horizon Europe, citizen science will have an important place with more dedicated funding. Speakers presented some of their CS projects such as Rosa Arias from [Science for Change](http://www.scienceforchange.eu/) which is developing user-centered, innovative services and products based on citizen science; or Mordechai Haklay (UCL) who talked about the [EU Citizen Science Platform](http://eu-citizen.science/) (hosted by the Citizen Science Association) - a project started in January this year aiming to become a mutual learning space; the publication [Innovation in Open Science, Society and Policy](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10058422/1/Citizen-Science.pdf) and the [Extreme Citizen Science blog](https://uclexcites.blog/). Some of these might be useful for our preparation of Swafs applications.\n\nOther points to note:\n\n* A novelty for innovation support: [Innovation Fund](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/innovation-fund_en#tab-0-0) is focusing on innovative low-carbon technologies. First call for projects will be launched next year.\n* [European Investment Project Portal](https://ec.europa.eu/eipp/desktop/en/index.html?2nd-language=en) for matchmaking could be useful if you are looking for investors.\n\nDuring these Days we\u2019ve heard a lot about how the US or China are investing much more than the EU does in research and innovation. In this competition, the EU investment goes from 80 billion to 100 billion expected for the [Horizon Europe](https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe-next-research-and-innovation-framework-programme_en). The [public consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/HorizonEurope_Codesign_2021-2024) is still open until 4th of October. \n\nVideo recordings of the sessions are available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/events/cf/european-research-and-innovation-days/programme.cfm?id=452).", "created_at": "2019-09-27 11:58:15.875172", "updated_at": "2019-09-27 11:58:54.082355", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 869, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 57.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75812, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13374, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hello @welf,\n\nThank you very much!

I came across this piece while preparing for a summit we are building around resilient livelihoods in the aftermath of Covid19 + ahead of future crises (e.g due to climate/ecological degradation or geopolitics). A key issue arises when you are exploring solutions that require reliability and consistency of access, e.g life critical healthcare: How can the outcomes of evasive responses to institutional failures be sustained for long enough to become established alternatives? How to build capacity for long term stewardship of material and relational assets that are build through, and sustain, these initiatives? \n\nAn illuminating example is that outlined by Alberto*: \n\n of a cluster of companies (many of which co-operatives), non-profits, research and art organizations, co-ordinated by Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 Messina ([http://www.fdcmessina.org](http://www.fdcmessina.org/), henceforth FCM). This cluster consists of 120 local enterprises, employing some 400 people, created or consolidated in the last 20 years in or near the city of Messina, in Sicily. They were borne out of need to \"do something\" when all local seats in the elections were won by members of Berlusconi's party ( also there were indications of some oddities in how that had happened). The process was initiated in 1998 by a group of local people led by a physicist; they started by creating a research centre called EcosMed. EcosMed took on the mantle of championing a specific vision for local development, and over time managed to get several other enterprises up and running and working together as a cluster. In 2010, they leveraged a European policy (green certificates for producing renewable energy) and a national/regional one (a large foundation called Fondazione con il Sud was doubling capital to any Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 being constituted in Italy\u2019s Mezzogiorno) to create FCM as a superstructure. FCM also has institutional partners, like business associations and a cooperative bank called Banca Etica. \n\nFrom an economic point of view, the cluster made three moves which contain the seeds of long term stewardship.\n\n1. **Relational goods** . Some goods store value because they encode relationships. Example: several world-famous artists in the Mediterranean area donated pieces to Fondazione Horcynus Orca, the cluster\u2019s main art org. In fact, FHO runs a contemporary art museum that never bought any piece, everything was donated or produced in-house via artist residencies. This collection is worth several millions, but of course FHO could not really sell it except in very dire circumstances. Instead, they leverage it to attract private donors. Other example: Messina had a local brewery, Birrificio di Messina. This was purchased by Heineken, that ended up closing the plant and relocating production, keeping the brand. FCM persuaded the laid-off workers to start a cooperative to make a new brewery, and attracted a 6M EUR investment. 700 people attended the brewery\u2019s grandopening, because\n> the beer tastes very good, but it also carries the values of dignity, community resurrection and human development to purchasers.\nThe new company was already turning a profit in its first year.\n2. **Stocks over flows** . The creation of FCM marked a shift from producing income (a flow) to fund Messina\u2019s social and civic transformation to securing the capital (various stocks) that generate that income. The difference is resilience: if you are sitting on your own stocks, you are not at the mercy of short-term changes in marked conditions (or, worse, funding landscapes), and you have the breathing space to plan countermoves when difficulties strike.\n3. **A system, not a network** .\n> In a network, participants look for how to make the most of what others are doing. In a system, participants are willing to re-orient their work, so as to better work with the other participants. If you are a construction company, you must not be lazy, and be open to using new technologies. If you are a social cooperative, you must look away from providing standardized services to customizing what they do in order to better valorize the capabilities of the people they are assisting. And so on.\n\n#### I was wondering if  you, or anyone else have come across any other comparable examples  since or before you posted :point_up_2:t5: ?\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n**Original post: https://edgeryders.eu/t/long-termism-in-economic-thinking-reflecting-on-the-experience-of-the-messina-advanced-cluster/12883*", "created_at": "2020-04-30 06:26:22.316445", "updated_at": "2020-04-30 06:28:07.256110", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 734, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70476, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12693, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@MariaEuler", "created_at": "2020-02-22 10:24:56.189347", "updated_at": "2020-02-22 10:24:56.189347", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52560, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 8559, "post_number": 3, "raw": "It makes sense, no problem for me.", "created_at": "2019-04-15 07:37:21.405866", "updated_at": "2019-04-15 07:37:21.405866", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [52556], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86175, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14726, "post_number": 2, "raw": "for some reason the \"services\" cards don't load on the page anymore @owen", "created_at": "2020-11-03 09:29:18.025935", "updated_at": "2020-11-03 09:29:18.025935", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69478, "user_id": 5547, "topic_id": 12473, "post_number": 8, "raw": "[quote=\"badr_el_merzouki_10, post:7, topic:12473\"]\nco-fondateur et g\u00e9rant d\u2019une agence de communication de 2012 \u00e0 2017\n[/quote]\nbonjour @badr_el_merzouki_10 tu peux nous faire part de votre portfolio?", "created_at": "2020-01-28 07:24:29.288902", "updated_at": "2020-01-28 07:24:29.288902", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 27.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [69465], "is_reply_to": [69465], "is_liked_by": [6078], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1860, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1827, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello all: following last week's community call, some of us put together a <a href=\"/t/lote3/312\">Living On The Edge conference minisite</a>.

By\u0142a to zreszt\u0105 szko\u0142a publiczna sprzed reformy, czyli lepsza, w moim odczuciu, ni\u017c te teraz. Szko\u0142y publiczne zosta\u0142y dzisiaj szko\u0142ami narodowymi, gdzie dyrektorzy powszechnie wprowadzaj\u0105 celebrowanie \u015bwi\u0105t narodowych i czcz\u0105 \u017bo\u0142nierzy Wykl\u0119tych. Cz\u0119sto odbywa si\u0119 to pod naciskiem w\u0142adz lokalnych. Reforma-deforma spowodowa\u0142a, \u017ce podstawy programowe s\u0105 nastawione na teksty zwi\u0105zane z martyrologi\u0105, poczuciem to\u017csamo\u015bci narodowej. Wraca Romantyzm z ca\u0142\u0105 narodow\u0105 tradycj\u0105, i o ile w tamtym czasie (mam na my\u015bli XIX w.) by\u0142o to uzasadnione walk\u0105 o niepodleg\u0142o\u015b\u0107 kraju i \u00f3wcze\u015bni pisarze nie byli nacjonalistami, tak ich si\u0119 teraz przedstawia, bez pokazywania szerszego kontekstu.

Jednocze\u015bnie i r\u00f3wnolegle w polskich szko\u0142ach w ostatnich latach szerzy si\u0119 ksenofobia, podsycana przekazem medialnym wrogim wszystkiemu co nienormatywne.\n\nW szkole po reformie jest powr\u00f3t do nauczania typowo wiedzowego. Wa\u017cne s\u0105 tre\u015bci, kt\u00f3re ucze\u0144 ma wku\u0107. Brak tu miejsca na uczenie krytycznego, problemowego my\u015blenia. Wiele element\u00f3w zosta\u0142o przekopiowanych z dawnej podstawy programowej, tej z lat 90-tych, kt\u00f3r\u0105 pami\u0119tam z dzieci\u0144stwa. Po reformie z 2017 r. lektury szkolne zmieni\u0142y si\u0119 na gorsze, czyt. przestarza\u0142e i nauczyciele stracili prawo do swobodnego wyboru lektur (poprzednio nie by\u0142o \u015bcis\u0142ego kanonu). Dzi\u015b nie mo\u017cesz nie realizowa\u0107 lektur obowi\u0105zkowych, bo s\u0105 one na egzaminie ko\u0144cowym, wi\u0119c nie masz wyboru.\n\n_Czym wyr\u00f3\u017cnia si\u0119 Twoja szko\u0142a od innych szk\u00f3\u0142?_\n\nNasz szko\u0142a znana jest te\u017c niestety jako szko\u0142a &ldquo;snob\u00f3w&rdquo;: mamy wysokie czesne, wi\u0119c posy\u0142ane s\u0105 do nas osoby z okre\u015blonych spo\u0142ecznych kr\u0119g\u00f3w: biznesmeni, lekarze, prawnicy.

I cho\u0107 nauczyciele staraj\u0105 si\u0119 z tym walczy\u0107, przypomina to raczej walk\u0119 Don Kichota z wiatrakami.\nCo wyr\u00f3\u017cnia nas pozytywnie? W naszej szkole k\u0142adziemy wielki nacisk na indywidualizacj\u0119 - nasze relacje z uczniami s\u0105 partnerskie, uczniowie nie boj\u0105 si\u0119 pyta\u0107, prosi\u0107 o pomoc, przez co odbierani s\u0105 czasem jako bezczelni. Staramy si\u0119 im dawa\u0107 szersze pole do dyskusji ni\u017c w szkole publicznej, co czasami sprawia, \u017ce przekraczaj\u0105 granice, ale wol\u0119 traktowa\u0107 to jako ich krok w rozpoznawaniu \u015bwiata ni\u017c hamowa\u0107 i odg\u00f3rnie pi\u0119tnowa\u0107 takie zachowania. Jako polonistka mam szerokie pole do dyskusji z uczniami - operuj\u0119 na tekstach i wybieram tematy, kt\u00f3re uwa\u017cam za istotne i rozwijaj\u0105ce. I tak pomagam uczniom bada\u0107 i poszerza\u0107 granice ich \u015bwiata.\n\nIstniej\u0105 te\u017c mi\u0119dzyprzedmiotowe, ponadpodmiotowe modu\u0142y w naszej szkolnej edukacji. Uczniowie sk\u0142aniani s\u0105 do odkrywania swojej to\u017csamo\u015bci, ucz\u0105 si\u0119 autorefleksji, krytycznego my\u015blenia, postrzegania siebie w kontek\u015bcie \u015bwiata, planety, zwracania uwagi na to, jak j\u0119zyk kszta\u0142tuje \u015bwiat i postrzeganie. Organizujemy te\u017c warsztaty, np. z samoobrony dla dziewczyn (nie tylko fizycznej, ale te\u017c psychologicznej). Mamy program matury mi\u0119dzynarodowej, w kt\u00f3rym jest przedmiot Service as Action - uczniowie wymy\u015blaj\u0105 sobie w jego ramach dzia\u0142ania spo\u0142eczne/charytatywne i maj\u0105 udokumentowa\u0107, co i jak zrobili w jego ramach. Amnesty International dzia\u0142a u nas pr\u0119\u017cnie od lat.\n\nNiestety, prywatna szko\u0142a to te\u017c korporacja - firma, kt\u00f3ra ma szko\u0142\u0119, szpitale, firmy samochodowe, nieruchomo\u015bci, etc. S\u0105 w zwi\u0105zku z tym rzeczy, kt\u00f3re wed\u0142ug mnie szkodz\u0105 szkole - np. do niedawna mieli\u015bmy max. 18 uczni\u00f3w w klasie, dwa lata temu zwi\u0119kszono ten limit do 20 uczni\u00f3w. Liczba klas wzros\u0142a z dw\u00f3ch na poziomie do 3, a w jednym roczniku nawet do 4 - a budynek nie ro\u015bnie. W szkole prywatnej wi\u0119ksze s\u0105 te\u017c oczekiwania rodzic\u00f3w dzieci, kt\u00f3rzy cz\u0119\u015bciej ni\u017c w szko\u0142ach publicznych pr\u00f3buj\u0105 wp\u0142yn\u0105\u0107 na decyzje nauczycieli dotycz\u0105ce sposob\u00f3w nauczania czy oceniania.\n\n&ldquo;Zmiana to rozw\u00f3j&rdquo; - to has\u0142o naszej szko\u0142y. Z jednej strony jest to dobre, z drugiej czasem czujemy si\u0119 prze\u0142adowani ilo\u015bci\u0105 obowi\u0105zkowych, dodatkowych szkole\u0144 i eksperyment\u00f3w, z kt\u00f3rych cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 okazuje si\u0119 nieudana. Dobre jest jednak to, \u017ce w mojej szkole docenia si\u0119 prac\u0119 nauczycieli. Dostajemy wyp\u0142at\u0119 przez ca\u0142y rok, za 12 miesi\u0119cy, a nie za 10 i mamy normalne wakacje i ferie. Nie wszystkie szko\u0142y prywatne to praktykuj\u0105. Jako nauczyciele nie boimy si\u0119 te\u017c zg\u0142asza\u0107 dyrektorowi skarg czy uwag na temat tego, jak dzia\u0142a szko\u0142a. Te skargi/uwagi s\u0105 brane pod uwag\u0119 przy ewaluacji pracy szko\u0142y.\n\nCo jeszcze nas wyr\u00f3\u017cnia? Wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 szk\u00f3\u0142 publicznych zamawia msze na pocz\u0105tek roku szkolnego i zwykle idzie si\u0119 na nie razem z uczniami. Mam wra\u017cenie, \u017ce w Polsce jest niepisana zasada, \u017ce nauczyciele powinni si\u0119 na nich pojawia\u0107 - to nie jest obowi\u0105zek, ale presja spo\u0142eczna dzia\u0142a. Tymczasem w naszej szkole w og\u00f3le tego nie ma.\n\nCo wi\u0119cej, mamy w szkole realnie odbywaj\u0105c\u0105 si\u0119 etyk\u0119, dost\u0119pn\u0105 wszystkim uczniom, kt\u00f3rzy wyra\u017c\u0105 ch\u0119\u0107 uczestnictwa. Inaczej to wygl\u0105da w szkole publicznej, gdzie jeszcze do niedawna musia\u0142o by\u0107 min. 7 os\u00f3b w grupie, \u017ceby w og\u00f3le te zaj\u0119cia zorganizowa\u0107. Ponadto godziny przewidziane na etyk\u0119 w szkole publicznej s\u0105 bardzo cz\u0119sto niedogodne dla uczni\u00f3w i rodzic\u00f3w (np. o 7 rano albo 17), wi\u0119c niestety w wielu przypadkach nauczanie etyki jest fikcj\u0105. Dodatkowo zdarza si\u0119 pi\u0119tnowanie uczni\u00f3w, kt\u00f3rzy opuszczaj\u0105 zaj\u0119cia religii i chodz\u0105 zamiast tego na etyk\u0119. U nas si\u0119 to nie zdarza. Etyka jest na wysokim poziomie, nauczycielka jest po filozofii, nie tak jak to bywa w wielu szko\u0142ach, gdzie lekcje te prowadzi katecheta. Nasza nauczycielka sama wymy\u015bla program w oparciu o podstaw\u0119 programow\u0105 i \u0142\u0105czy na zaj\u0119ciach religioznawstwo z kulturoznawstwem. Ch\u0119tnie sama chodzi\u0142abym na jej zaj\u0119cia.\n\nJe\u015bli chodzi o nauczanie religii, mamy w szkole siostr\u0119 zakonn\u0105, ale wielu uczni\u00f3w zwraca si\u0119 do niej per: &ldquo;prosz\u0119 pani&rdquo;, co po\u015bwiadcza \u015bwiecko\u015b\u0107 ich domowego wychowania. Z moich obserwacji wynika, \u017ce uczniowie nie znaj\u0105 kultury katolickiej (niekt\u00f3rzy pytaj\u0105 na przyk\u0142ad: &ldquo;czy ksi\u0105dz jest m\u0119\u017cem zakonnicy&rdquo;), a jednak chodz\u0105 na te lekcje.\n\nW szkole publicznej mia\u0142am wi\u0119cej czasu dla siebie. Tu przygotowujemy wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 lekcji i materia\u0142\u00f3w sami. Tylko kilka razy w roku zagl\u0105dam do podr\u0119cznik\u00f3w, kt\u00f3rych tre\u015bci, a g\u0142\u00f3wnie proponowane zadania, uwa\u017cam za infantylizuj\u0105ce. Bardzo dobrze dzia\u0142a u nas wsp\u00f3\u0142praca mi\u0119dzy nauczycielami. Wraz z kole\u017cankami wymieniamy si\u0119 pomys\u0142ami i rozwi\u0105zaniami czy scenariuszami zaj\u0119\u0107. Pracuj\u0105c w ten spos\u00f3b staramy si\u0119 omija\u0107 wszystkie metody, kt\u00f3re sugeruj\u0105 schematyczne rozwi\u0105zania. Poprzez selekcj\u0119 i samodzielny dob\u00f3r tekst\u00f3w staramy si\u0119 te\u017c eliminowa\u0107 z procesu nauczania niepotrzebne rzeczy. Po latach mam wi\u0119c ju\u017c nie\u017ale opracowan\u0105 baz\u0119 materia\u0142\u00f3w.\n\n_Jak oceniacie swoich uczni\u00f3w?_\n\nJednym z fajnych element\u00f3w naszej szko\u0142y jest te\u017c formative assessment, czyli ocenianie kszta\u0142tuj\u0105ce. To dawanie informacji zwrotnej zamiast stopnia. Filozofia OK jest taka, \u017ce \u0107wiczymy jak\u0105\u015b umiej\u0119tno\u015b\u0107, upewniaj\u0105c si\u0119, \u017ce ucze\u0144 wie, co ma z tego wynie\u015b\u0107. Najlepiej, gdy dodatkowo dziecko ma \u015bwiadomo\u015b\u0107, jak mo\u017ce dan\u0105 umiej\u0119tno\u015b\u0107 wykorzysta\u0107 w \u017cyciu. Zanim przejdziemy do oceniania pracy ucznia, dajemy kryteria, jasno sformu\u0142owane polecenia, czas na prac\u0119. Nast\u0119pnie uczniowie sprawdzaj\u0105 mi\u0119dzy sob\u0105 wykonane zadanie, przekazuj\u0105 sobie wskaz\u00f3wki, a dopiero potem wkraczamy my, nauczyciele. Sprawdzamy wynik pracy lub analizujemy proces, dajemy uczniowi feedback i wskazujemy obszary do dalszej pracy. I tak w wielkim skr\u00f3cie wygl\u0105da ocenianie kszta\u0142tuj\u0105ce.\n\nPytanie, czy stawiamy stopnie? Tak. S\u0105 u nas i oceny sumuj\u0105ce. Uczniowie wykonuj\u0105 zadania &ldquo;na ocen\u0119&rdquo;, jednak zanim to zrobi\u0105, dajemy im szans\u0119 po\u0107wiczy\u0107 i pouczy\u0107 si\u0119 na w\u0142asnych b\u0142\u0119dach, weryfikowanych wraz z r\u00f3wie\u015bnikami.\n\n_Jacy s\u0105 dzisiejsi uczniowie - i uczniowie w Twojej szkole? I jak my\u015blisz, sk\u0105d wzrost zainteresowania nacjonalizmem i faszyzmem w Polsce?_\n\nUczniowie zmienili si\u0119 od naszych czas\u00f3w - s\u0105 mniej samodzielni, by\u0107 mo\u017ce jeszcze bardziej w naszej szkole, gdzie jest silne partnerstwo i pomoc. Mamy u nas marginalny problem z rasizmem - jest to szko\u0142a mi\u0119dzynarodowa, wi\u0119c jest z tym \u0142atwiej. Przez dost\u0119pno\u015b\u0107 etyki czy filozofii, uczniowie nie my\u015bl\u0105, \u017ce jest jedyna s\u0142uszna i odpowiednia religia czy nar\u00f3d - co jest przeciwie\u0144stwem tego, co dzieje si\u0119 w szko\u0142ach publicznych, szczeg\u00f3lnie od 2015 roku.\nNiestety zauwa\u017cam, \u017ce w naszym mie\u015bcie/kraju nastroje nacjonalistyczne i ksenofobiczne wzrastaj\u0105. Przybywa m\u0142odych ludzi zamkni\u0119tych na odmienno\u015b\u0107, o ciasnych horyzontach, widz\u0105cych tylko czubek swojego nosa, bez szerszego kontekstu poza Wielk\u0105 Polsk\u0105 Narodow\u0105.\n\n_Czy popierasz strajk nauczycieli?_\n\nPopieram strajk nauczycieli, bo w tym kraju nie ma szacunku do naszej pracy - media narodowe pokazuj\u0105 nas jako osoby, kt\u00f3re pracuj\u0105 18 godzin w tygodniu, wielu nie bierze pod uwag\u0119 tego, ile wysi\u0142ku i czasu kosztuje nas przygotowanie do tej pracy i inne zwi\u0105zane z ni\u0105 zaj\u0119cia. Czasami licz\u0119 sw\u00f3j czas sp\u0119dzony na pracy i wychodzi mi ponad 40 godzin w tygodniu.\n\nJe\u015bli brakuje szacunku dla nauczycieli, to uczniowie nie chc\u0105 si\u0119 uczy\u0107, s\u0142ysz\u0105c w domach, jak to jeste\u015bmy biedni, niewiele mamy z naszej pracy, nikt nas nie szanuje. PIS t\u0119 sytuacj\u0119 tylko pogarsza. Przekaz medi\u00f3w ze strajku by\u0142 negatywny, pokazywa\u0142 nauczycieli jako darmozjad\u00f3w i leni. Rz\u0105dowi nie zale\u017cy na wsparciu &ldquo;klasy inteligenckiej&rdquo; - wiedz\u0105, \u017ce nie jeste\u015bmy ich elektoratem - a swoje szko\u0142y i tak b\u0119d\u0105 wspiera\u0107, pod warunkiem, \u017ce zrealizuj\u0105 ich program i b\u0119d\u0105 wpaja\u0107 uczniom odpowiednie tre\u015bci.\n\nBrak wsparcia dla nauczycieli doprowadzi do sytuacji, kiedy nie b\u0119dzie ju\u017c m\u0105drych os\u00f3b spe\u0142niaj\u0105cych zadanie edukowania m\u0142odych. Zast\u0105pi\u0105 nas bezkrytyczni wyrobnicy. Je\u015bli m\u0142odzie\u017c nie pozna mechanizm\u00f3w dzia\u0142ania historii, nie zastanowi si\u0119, co doprowadzi\u0142o do pewnych zdarze\u0144, nie b\u0119dzie \u0107wiczy\u0107 si\u0119 w krytycznym my\u015bleniu, ch\u0119tnie przyjmie narracj\u0119 nacjonalistyczn\u0105, zogniskowan\u0105 wok\u00f3\u0142 potrzeby przynale\u017cno\u015bci i wykluczenia. W zdogmatyzowanej szkole \u0142atwiej o wzrost popularno\u015bci radykalnych postaw w\u015br\u00f3d m\u0142odych os\u00f3b. My\u015bl\u0119 jednak,\u017ce nie gro\u017c\u0105 nam drugie W\u0119gry. Na szcz\u0119\u015bcie wzrasta zainteresowanie planet\u0105 i za\u0142amuj\u0105c\u0105 si\u0119 sytuacj\u0105 klimatyczn\u0105 i to raczej w t\u0105 stron\u0119 b\u0119dzie sz\u0142a energia m\u0142odych ludzi.

Anyone else interested in being more present in the process welcome to join, for example @hugi who was already involved in the initial stage.  \n\n**Background**: initially, we planned to build the consortium on our own, this was initiated by Amelia (discussion [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/brainstorming-for-the-call-behavioural-social-and-cultural-change-for-the-green-deal/14654)). We then realized it will take too much effort and being low on capacity we were exploring options to join the forming consortium integrating this idea in their concept. \n\nThrough the Linkedin campaign we got to [IEECP](http://www.ieecp.org/) (contact and the principal investigator Filippos Anagnostopoulos) and scheduled a meeting. In that call I realized they are working on this topic and that they are pretty flexible in accepting suggestions. Also even before knowing us they had the idea for the task \"Social Network Analysis for change agents\". The match was made. \n\nAs a next step we organized a call between Filippos, Amelia and myself and further discussed our role and contribution. Amelia then drafted a document outlining our workpackage (very similar to PARTENAIRE) + general concept and more information on the methodology.\n\nWe also proposed that University of Aalborg becomes a partner and takes over the task of social media analysis (which they wanted to do anyway as part of their initial concept). Anders agrees to join, but has little time to dedicate to the proposal. Filippos would like to meet him - this is in process. \n\nAll the working documents have been shared with Amelia and me through \"teams\" and some documentation is also on [our Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/18iqcaIEyz0vHKVRl0tl3kKoyppGuAMrP). \n\nSome other confirmed partners a part from IEECP and us include: KEA, C-KIC, Awaris and discussions are ongoing with several other organizations and universities. \n\n**Next steps**: \n\n- participate in team calls - these are scheduled on a weekly basis, on Tuesdays at 13h30 (CET). Amelia and I will be there.\n- first week of December there will be a proposal workshop, lasting 4-6 hours for fine tuning direction, connections and needs. \n- when it comes to defining the budget and KPIs we will consult with the extended team, namely @alberto @nadia & @matthias for IT.\n\nKeep an eye on this space for further updates ;)", "created_at": "2020-11-19 12:30:45.303410", "updated_at": "2020-11-20 09:57:16.224776", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 437, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 41.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68188, "user_id": 5069, "topic_id": 12271, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hej, \n\nzawsze warto kontynuowa\u0107 w\u0105tek mieszkaniowy, bo jest z\u0142o\u017cony, najbli\u017cszy ludziom i najbardziej pomijany przez polityk\u00f3w.

He carried a large camping stove, a large tank of water, a large bag of coffee and five or six coffee machines. He started offering hot coffee to people digging in the rubble.\n\nOver the following two days, \"Quake Caf\u00e9\" became a meeting point for people to get organised, plan their effort for the day, hustle for wanted materials, offer help, exchange information (this is 1980, no Twitter). By offering a natural \"hub\", Quake Caf\u00e9 had enabled a myriad small initiative to happen faster and more efficiently, with a minimal effort. Positive feedback kicked in: the barista himself got more organised, he now had small snacks and a helper. All the while, the state was struggling to get together a response. On the third day, the army moved in, but they had more guns than shovels. They could not much to help, at least initially, but they did order the barista to pack up and go home. \n\nLanzara was stunned. How was it that local people could stitch together the embryo of a system in a few hours, with no resources, no command power and no coordination tools? And how was it that the mighty machine of the state, who did have resources, command power and organisation, sputtered first and then actually did damage, preventing what was working from continuing operations? \n\nThis small episode, and a few others in the same earthquake, spurred a wave of sociological literature that continues to this day. I have only read Lanzara's 1993 [book](http://www.lafeltrinelli.it/libri/lanzara-giovan-francesco/capacita-negativa/9788815040862) (in Italian), but not his earlier article in English on the _Journal of Management Studies_, and not the [book by Rebecca Solnit](https://www.amazon.com/Paradise-Built-Hell-Extraordinary-Communities/dp/0143118072) which probably you, @michael_dunn, have in mind.  \n\nI am not too optimistic about the possibility to do policy based on these intuition. They are by definition anti-policy.

The Reef is one of the projects in EarthOS.\n\n**@Hugi, Edgeryders board member and Blivande (Stockholm) co-founder:** a co-working space, makerspace and participatory art space. It is everything but a co-living.\nLearn about Blivande here: https://edgeryders.eu/t/blivande-growing-a-sustainable-ecosystem/10851\n\n**@xaver from IG Langhuus: a cultural centre in Cham, a small town in Switzerland.** \u2018At the moment we use trello and stuff to coordinate, it would be great to use open source\u2019.\n\nXaver wants to think about prototyping and doing actual things in the space, figure out things like: What is the minimum space you need to live? How much storage space?\n\nIn Switzerland, there is a standard - an industrial hall and individual spaces are 3x3 sq metres and you move them around; In a big event, you place all the rooms in one corner; it\u2019s interesting, because it enables new ways to experiment with ways to live together.\n\n\u2018We are trust building outside luxury apartments, that can\u2019t be the future.\u2019\n\nI want to build something of a new model, to show how other things also can be fun.\n\nLimitation is not a bad thing, but it\u2019s the thing that makes us creative.\n\nInteresting event to check out: https://ecovillage.org/event/communities-future-summit/\n\n**Nenad & Robert from Ecolise and other spaces, lots of experience with co-living, permaculture communities and also policy**\n\n@Nenad is a network weaver, and the person to thank for connecting Edgeryders to Ecolise! :-)\n\nRobert used to live in this intentional community in Gotland (Sweden): suderbyn.se\n\n\u2018I am currently involved with established actors in Belgium to create a national eco-communities network we are calling BelgEco (belgeco.net). It is hoped that this network will be able to link up eco-communities all over Belgium and thus connect these communities with like-minded projects in Europe and further afield. We have a list of 44 such eco-communities in Belgium that needs to be refined in the future. Maybe the Reef Brussels would be interested in this embryonic network?\n\nJust as a side story, I am currently in a working group organising an eco-community in Brussels. The interest has been overwhelming and there are some 25-30 persons in the project. A series of meetings and many interviews have been held. We are hoping to be physically set up in our community by 1 August.\u2019\n\n[www.ecolise.eu](http://www.ecolise.eu) Ecolise has 13 part time employees, relatively strong organisation - can do things in policy and research. Of 43 members, there are 1000 communities connected in our network. Living and working. They are doing interesting things and would like to share the ideas with each other.\n\nConcerted effort is the initiative Communities for Future to reach out to others and show that there are a lot of inspiring things going on. But: poor IT infrastructure to talk to everyone.\n\n**@Val.Muresan and @Bogdan are from Faber, in Timisoara, Romania:** a reconverted industrial space with a co-work, a fablab and a bistro in house. Have a future garden space of 2000 sq metres. A private space, therefore less dependent on city plans.\nLearn about Faber here: https://edgeryders.eu/t/new-reef-partner-faber-community-space-in-timisoara/12895/\n\nInterest in Edgeryders: How to work/ co-work together.\n\nIt is not important for us that we are not alone in this - we are part of a network of experience.\n\nSpaces with different functionalities to bring people together.\n\nPragmatically: they are looking for partners for some calls; They need to be in: Norway, Ireland, Liechtenstein\n\n**@Alessandro is an Italian living in Armenia:** is looking to set up a private co-living space. Wondering how to start and if it\u2019s needed to have a legal framework. The answers from others were that you make a legal entity when you need it ex: when you need a bank account. The space where Robert used to live in Sweden is stewarded by a foundation, which makes it less liable to be lost in case of financial problems of members.\n\n# Moving forward, it would be important to learn:\n\n1. What members in the network are doing and where they need help from the Reef - invitation to blog about your initiatives in this open platform\n2. Edgeryders can steward the online sharing and exchanges, while looking for funding opportunities\n3. Learning and feeling accompanied by others in the network is an important goal for all of us.\n\n# Actionables:\n\n* Meeting in Brussels with Alberto, Robert and others who are around\n* Alberto will post about the energy Horizon 2020 call (a concept note and possible project led by Edgeryders) on the platform\n* Faber team to keep us posted about funding calls they are looking at; and to sign the MOU!\n* Xaver: thinking about collaborative tools and ways to implement the knowledge in wikis such as [The Future of Ecological Urban Living](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-ecological-urban-living/12097/)", "created_at": "2020-06-03 07:35:21.785643", "updated_at": "2020-06-03 08:23:10.084564", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 887, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 52.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59233, "user_id": 5092, "topic_id": 10755, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Oh yeah, no that's a fantastic example!\n\n[Sent from a mobile, please apologize the brevity and typos.]", "created_at": "2019-09-12 18:49:35", "updated_at": "2019-09-12 18:51:39.062577", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 21.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [59227], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61715, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11165, "post_number": 18, "raw": "Great! @noemi could you introduce the documentation method to @jasen_lakic or share a post that describes it?", "created_at": "2019-10-18 19:31:34.286972", "updated_at": "2019-10-18 19:31:34.286972", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 12.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42828, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 8303, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I feel you @hazem , I was stranded two times in airports just like Tom Hanks in \"The Terminal\", because of bureaucracy...arghhh it's the worst...good luck! <3", "created_at": "2018-03-14 03:38:57.008827", "updated_at": "2018-03-14 03:38:57.008827", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 29, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 24.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65071, "user_id": 5698, "topic_id": 11163, "post_number": 21, "raw": "Aloha @gyrgir, in our experience common ground and shared experience puts everyone on the same side. Trust in the psychological nature of human beings. Once the psychological construction of personality is understood, our human commonality becomes very evident & undeniable. Our shared experience of horror revealed by pre- and perinatal psychology gives evidence that all of us hold a bit of PTSD.\n\nLack of trust towards strangers & those one already doesn't like is all based on the paranoid-schizoid defenses that produces the mental construction of alters, a good self and a bad self projected onto others. While common enough to be considered universal, it's our belief they all can be reintegrated into persons' individual personalities. This integration involves crossing a mental boundary.\n\n[quote=\"gyrgir, post:20, topic:11163\"]\nwhen we try to think of ways to make people work together\n[/quote]\n\nWin-Win is possible, especially when feelings are acknowledged. Otherwise, there would be no philanthropy, for example. Start with the idea that deep down, people wish to work together but will always resist & resent ways to \"make them\" do anything. Insisting on new rules that must be obeyed will always find resistance if not provoke rebellion.\n\n[quote=\"gyrgir, post:20, topic:11163\"]\ncompletely new, exciting, but also terrifying-in-their-unfamiliarity economic systems\n[/quote]\n\nRole playing can be most useful when introducing new concepts because it can be learned with nothing much at risk. Play is widely perceived as a safe space, as is narrative speculative fiction like SF.\n\nAlso, we consider that PTSD is not deviance or dysfunction. It only must be so framed for society to provide aid. Actually, and we've found many professionals who agree, PTSD is a normal human response to horrific circumstances.

In practice, though, it means that when you select someone else\u2019s code, the annotation automatically falls under their code, and it becomes difficult to check that you meant the same thing as them.\n\n* **Long-term solution** : create colour-coded differentiation between ethnographers in the same project, so you can see whose code you are selecting in the drop-down.\n* **Short-term solution** : revert to your own coding view and use the same backend merge process as you did before.

I read Polish texts, but code in English first and add Polish translation second. It also makes working in the backend easier, since no matter what language I have set in my user preferences, it can only show me codes in English (unless there is something I don't know). Maybe it could also show codes in other languages?\nNonetheless, what you wrote explains a lot, thank you :slight_smile: !\n\nThe issue of automatic mergers remains an important question still. \nThen there is the thing with me not being able to properly sort the codes alphabetically when my language is set to Polish in the backend.

I have been collaborating with a social startup in Kenya to support Maasai women have a decent life. In addition to that, I have recently launched my blog called Ubuntu which aims mainly to inspire women challenge societal stereotypes and follow their dreams.\n- For the Didi Asks project: I am passionate about the role of technology in achieving social change. I got introduced to a very-interesting startup in Nairobi which uses games to improve education and I got to support the team to understand their community needs, conduct field research and prepare the Theory of Change model. I have experience with brainstorming, crowdfunding, and a rich game circle network. Thus, I believe I can be an asset to the project.\n- For Diyafa project: I tried before launching a similar initiative and I failed to do so. I am willing to share my learnings from that experience with Diyafa's entrepreneur so we can together make the initiative happen. \n\n**What is your domain of expertise?

You  introduce yourself to the community on our online forum let us know about yourself and your needs, or what support you would like to offer, here: https://edgeryders.eu/c/campfire or via community@edgeryders.eu\n2. We help you shape a request for support and instructions for how people can help.\n3. We publish it on the community forum. Members of the network can then ask you questions and you can answer them in one place, so you can direct people to one place with the key information.  \n4. Our community managers then draw the attention of  the right people in the community etc ([see example here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/didi-asks-social-game/10700/12))\n5. Community managers organise a video chat with the community to help coordinate community members efforts around projects and organisations that have asked us for help- and structure it into a concise call for participation ([like this](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-did-we-discuss-during-the-covid19-community-response-call-1-what-will-we-do-next/12945/10))\n6. The call for participation is blasted out to a broader audience via our personal and professional networks via word of mouth, social media, newsletters, partner organisations etc.\n7. People show up on the platform and our community managers help coordinate efforts so people who are busy building the projects don't have to.\n\nOnce the crisis is over, we throw  community gatherings where everyone meets, shares experiences and celebrates in person ( local groups organise them in different parts of the world - see [last years edition here](https://festival.edgeryders.eu/))\n<br>\n\n# Who this is for\n**Project leaders: Need support to build, develop or drive adoption of a solution**\n* already have an initiative up and running\n* are looking for mentors, partners or any kind of support\n* willing to have shareholders, and commit to start new entreprises\n\n**Project contributors:** **Want to support promising initiatives to achieve impact**\n\n* Want to invest some time into building new paths to generate income for themselves\n* Want to develop new skills\n* Want to grow their professional network\n\n**Problem owners:** **have a problem that you care about and want to see fixed**\n* Want to be involved in developing and testing solutions to the problem\n* have some kind of leadership role in a context where the problem is very present\n* are willing to invest financial or nonfinancial resources into self-sustaining solutions that come out of the incubator\n\n**Organisations that need help with their work: You want to contribute to and benefit from a network of mutual aid efforts**\n* Are part of project, group or organisation doing work in response to the current (and future) crises.\n* Are up for putting in 1 hours to come to a webinar to introduce your work and answer follow up questions from participants\n* Are willing to put in some effort  to support someone else's work (adapted to your availability and constraints)\n\n**Mobilisers: You see people doing important work you want others to support**\n* Know of a project, group or person doing inspiring work\n* Are up for putting in 1.5 hours to help them\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n## Where is this initiative coming from?\n\nIn this discussion about how we take back the internet Howard was pointing to about a key function we  can take on to be useful in the context: \"What can we do to help your organization and to help grow a network of mutual aid efforts?\u201d\n\nThe exchange between @howard_rheingold @alberto  @ton \n\n[quote]\n@howard_rheingold:\n\n> Have you guys thought of taking on the work of coordinating between large organizations and this patchwork of initiatives that are popping up in response to COVID-19?\n\n@alberto\n\n> Yes, but we struggle. Everyone is shouting for attention. And what you call greenspaces (nice name, by the way!) seem mostly hyperlocal, ephemeral \u2013 they are out there, but I do not see them connecting. No one is keeping track of the big picture.\n[/quote]\n\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:1, topic:12971\"]\nSuddenly, everyone\u2019s social media feed is full of bottom-up, self-organized initiatives for mutual aid. Everyone is releasing previously paywalled content, offering help, creating resources and directories. Is the communitarian Internet back? The question is important, because Edgeryders considers itself a virtual community, one of the last of the original, early wave virtual communities. We were born as a response to the previous crisis, the 2008 financial collapse. In the wake of COVID-19, we are mobilizing, just like everybody else ([example ](/t/12962), [other example ](/t/12886)). But: are we doing enough? Are we making the right moves?\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"ton, post:12, topic:12971\"]\n* there is a long list of unconnected initiatives out there currently. Looking at a range of them here in the Netherlands, while some seem to have some substance, many others seem more a coping strategy that keeps one busy but has no impact or meaning on the originator\u2019s scope of action or anyone else\u2019s agency. Kind of like the way I keep a spreadsheet with case numbers in NL, providing a sense of control or something, but then announcing it to the world as yet another Covid dashboard for coders and designers to contribute to.\nAt the same time initiatives that might have a real impact are invisible and never mentioned online unless they become visible once creating such impact. (e.g. my brother in law\u2019s 3d printer company has approached all businesses and factories that use their printers to donate printing capacity, creating a global networked printing facility, and now discussing with manufacturers (like Phillips) and health ministries how to deploy that network to print respirator parts and masks where needed. It won\u2019t be publicly announced as a bottom-up initiative, and it may not be publicly mentioned at all ever.) How do we filter wheat and chaff on a list of initiatives, or do we have a role in guiding others to potentially more meaningful activities and away from the coping projects like my spreadsheet/ other\u2019s shiny dashboards?\n[/quote]\n\n**What these exchanges and many more we have had here over the years, is the need for people to reach out beyond our respective \"homes\" on the internet, and interact in other spaces.**\n\nTo find and make visible the unsung heroes and invisible efforts required to achieve impact in tackling the current and future crises. \n\n**This needs to move beyond collecting static repositories of information like links or manuals.** Rather we need a combination of first hand accounts, conversations as well as dedicated people to synthesise and structure it all into concrete calls for participation/support. Then carry the weight of coordinating the people who do show up to help.\n\n**In the end it all comes down to building meaningful, active, relationships between a lot of people.** Building, growing and activating dense networks. Making visible and accessible the knowledge carried within these networks, yes. But more importantly, making it possible to find, learn and interact with the individuals with whom we can get things done.\n\n**Our mission with this effort is to contribute towards this and engage others to do the same within their own settings.** Because we believe this is needed for communities and societies as a whole to get better at responding to these crises in the future.  \n\n\n<hr>\n<br>\n\n\n# FAQs\n\n## Are people paid to work on projects?\n\n*  Whenever possible, we try to find money to pay for people's time. Our ability to secure resources relies on a lot of unpaid work such as researching and writing grant applications. We all pitch into this and whenever paid work opportunities are born out of our collective conversations, they are advertised on the community platform: community members who either have, or demonstrate aptitude and will to quickly develop, the required skills are then first for the paid work opportunities.\n\n*  Our reasoning around this is that we prioritise pay for people who carry the brunt of the \"boring\" work  like coordination, or administration which requires significant commitment, specialised skills and personal accountability. Freelance work which requires a concentrated full time effort for more than a day or two  is next on the priority list. These often require significant administrative overhead due to the complex resource management and reporting requirements attached to our funding sources. What is easiest for us to cover is small expenses e.g for servers, materials or rental of equipment. \n\n#\n\n## Where does the data on the platform go?\n* **Sensing & Sensemaking:** Edgeryders has developed a [stack of open source tools to turn large scale conversational data into collective intelligence](https://sensestack.netlify.com/) (see our github repo). We use these tools to make interactive visualisations of what we are all posting on our community platform that anyone can use to get the bigger picture on what connections are being made between ideas, topics, projects, fields, experiences, places etc. And get a \"bigger picture\" sense of what all of this is telling us about the world around us. We regularly do training on how to set up and use them for your own work. Write to alberto@edgeryders.eu to learn more about this.\n\n* **Distributed coordination:** The tools also enable us see where there are clusters of people and projects which could better achieve impact with some alignment of practices, sharing of resources etc. We can see where there are overlapping areas of interest and focus our community management efforts towards building bridges, deepening relationships, seeding novel practices. To support others in doing this wherever they, we are building [ a mooc on distributed collaboration](https://crowdfund.edgeryders.eu/) that we will make freely available. write to nadia@edgeryders.eu.\n\n* **Research for public benefit:**  We regularly conduct action-oriented research projects around bigger issues. Like how to tackle the failure of market and state in providing health and social care services. Or   The coordination and community management work is partially financed by two European Commission research grants on how we build a next generation internet aligned with humanist values and how to tackle the rise of divise political movements. While the research projects are formally focused on Humans and Europe, we are well aware that crisis like the current pandemic or ecological breakdown do not respect borders. In order to truly make sense of how to address the big problems, the platform conversation is open to all. We participate in EU research consortia on a regular basis.

That just introduces an extra, unncessary step. I think it works like this. First, we define a data management workflow\u00a0for edgeryders.eu data. We are quite close already: we know about data, we need to figure out where to put the metadata.\u00a0We have three options:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>In-house (static page in the OpenCare minisite on edgeryders.eu). The advantage is that maintaining the same infrastructure takes care of both data and metadata. The disadvantages are aesthetics and findability. There is a tool for publishing beautiful API documentation onto your own serve and Github. It's called Slate:\u00a0https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>A commercial service like Mashape. Advantages:\u00a0looks nice, probably faster to put together, more findable. Disadvantages: one more thing to keep an eye on; I don't truse commercial services to be online in the long run.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>The EC-sponsored service. The Open Research Data Pilot is (loosely) coupled with something called <a href=\"https://www.openaire.eu/\">OpenAire</a>, the EC's open access infrastructure. For data, OpenAire seems to have spawned <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/\">Zenodo</a> (run by CERN). Advantages: long-term reliability, findability, better integration with Horizon 2020. Disadvantages: is seems to be mostly a repository for dumping static data onto, I cannot find a tool or guidelines to document APIs of data kept elsewhere. I have written to the Zenodo team, let's see what they\u00a0say.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nOnce we have made this decision, I guess it would be UBx to document the API and put it wherever we want them, and do so directly, without going through me.\u00a0\n\nWe could also go for redundancy: a nice lokking web page on Mashape (or Zenodo), but also a simple page on Edgeryders with a button to download the API doc.\u00a0\n\nPlease remember: this is NOT all of OpenCare's data management strategy, We still need to figure out how and where to document the output from the workshops in WeMake.

It treats online conversations as human communities that ethnographers can engage with as they would in traditional fieldwork. Then, it represents those conversations as codes developed by researchers. Next, it applies the tools of network analysis, which it labels semantic social networks, and uses these methods to analyse these ethnographic data.\n \nOverall, I believe that this manuscript is worth publishing in Field Methods. However, some revisions are required.  I have two major criticisms and some minor suggestions. First, I strongly recommend that the authors review the social science literature on semantic network analysis, and place ethnographic research in that context. There are numerous publications by Barnett, Doerfel, Danowski, Carley, Diesner, Corman, Jiang, and many others.  For a good entry into the literature see:\n \n<b>Jiang, K., Barnett, G.A., & Taylor, L. D., (2016). News framing in an international context: A semantic network analysis, International Journal of Communication, 10, 3710\u20133736.</b> <i> AH comment: I think we should all give this a read given that it comes up multiple times in the reviewer comments</i>\n \n**GM** This raises the second major criticism. **How does the proposed method differ from the more widely employed semantic network analysis?** *AH comment: this is the main question it seems that the reviewers need us to answer clearly in a more robust literature review.* Obviously, the ethnographer is conducting a network analysis of codes. But where do the codes come from?  Are they derived from the keywords in the text, from social theory or the researcher's intuition?  Why not go directly from the words, i.e., do a network analysis of the keywords (those that are most frequent or that the research deems important)?  And, what are the advantages of doing the network analysis from the codes rather than directly from the text itself? **AH DONE**\n \n**AH, with a check from AC** Page 11. In the OpenCare corpus that was used for an example, the authors report 1,248 nodes. Are there 1,248 different codes? Or over 1,200 concepts that make up the codes? If it is the former, what is the utility of creating all these codes?  Clearly, there is little parsimony in doing so, and it would seem to be a hindrance in describing the conversations in the text and the construction of elegant social theory.\n_AH comment: explain the first-pass coding and talk about how the codes collapsed over time w help from @alberto_\n\n**AH DONE** Page 12. The sentence, \u201cThe semantic social network gives both ethnographers who have spent extended time with the primary data and researchers without ability to sift through that data new insights\u201d. Is unclear.\n \n**AH DONE** Page 17. e ort  is spelled wrong.  Did you mean effort?\n \nPage 18. The first implication of the method for ethnography is very important.  I agree with you wholeheartedly.\n \n**AH DONE**  Page 18, pro-pose should be propose.\n \nPage 19. Is the section on Open data and large-scale collaboration in ethnography really necessary? I\u2019m not sure it fits into the focus of this manuscript, which is in the method of social semantic networks.\n \n**AC** Page 20. In addition, I recommend that the authors discuss generalizability and the ability to perform cross-cultural comparisons of the networks of codes?\n \n**MM** Page 21. Under future improvements, I would like more detail on plans to Weight the contributions (and consequently annotations) by a \"reliability score\" derived by applying social theory on the social network topology.\n \nOverall, the manuscript makes a significant contribution to research methods in cultural anthropology by introducing semantic networks to the community of ethnographic researchers and should be published with the revisions suggested.\n_________________________________________\n \n\n## reviewer #2\n \nThis manuscript proposes semantic social networks as a promising avenue for conducting ethnographic research on online domains such as discussion forums. The topic itself is timely and of great importance considering the ever-increasing data produced online as well as the profound changes in the human and social interactions. While I appreciate your effort in taking an interdisciplinary approach based on network science and qualitative analysis of texts, I have some concerns which, I feel, would require a substantial amount of work.\nBelow are the major issues that I would encourage you to consider in further developing this draft.\n \nMy main concern with this paper involves its problematization of the existing methodological approaches concerning digital ethnography and semantic social networks and, consequently, its contribution. More specifically, the framing of the semantic social networks as a mixed-methods approach to advance digital ethnography is interesting, but it appears poorly grounded in a theoretical sense (see, for example, recent papers on digital ethnography by Beaulieu (2004) and Murthy (2008) and **GM** reviews on semantic social networks by Gloor and Diesner (2014) and Thovex, Trichet, and LeGrand (2014)).  _AH comment: These are existing literatures I am not very familiar with as they come from CSCW/HCI, so I'll check them out and create a short lit review. @alberto if I focus on the digital ethnography literature (loosely defined, because anthropologists would not consider this 'ethnography', but I think the reviewers are right in that we need to review it or at least address it) can you take the semantic network literature mentioned above and below?_ **AH DONE** What I found promising in your paper is the potential of semantic social networks to extend ethnographic research by focusing on the collective level and exploring the interactions across participants which could be further emphasized.\n \nI admire your effort in collecting such an impressive dataset in relation to the OpenCare project, but the current draft would require a **more detailed description of the data that you have used for the purposes of this paper**. In addition, I found the use of \u2018primary\u2019 and \u2018secondary\u2019 data quite confusing and, oftentimes, misleading. Based on my reading of your current draft, the primary and secondary data as used here refer to the different layers of the analysis. To be more precise, the primary data would refer to the data level of analysis and the secondary to the semantic or conceptual level of analysis (see also Thovex, Trichet, and LeGrand (2014)).\n \n**AH DONE** I found that the section \u2018An application: The OpenCare data\u2019 could be improved a lot more. First, I would encourage you to provide more information with regards **the research question and research design** _AH comment: I can frame a clear research question in ethnographic terms based upon the OC question ''what do communities do when existing systems have failed them,\" but I'm wondering if they want something more concrete with regards to the network science? I think this could come down to structural and language adjustment of the paper, since I feel our question is clear (and in ethnography, always emergent)_ which you report here for a better contextualization of the application. \n\nSecond, I would focus more on the structural features of the social network that you have developed which could support your claims about \u2018clear core-periphery structure\u2019. In your manuscript, you make use of the Louvain modularity but this should be explained and justified a bit more. I would also encourage you to explore other measures as well such as degree centrality and cluster co-efficient (see Carpenter and Jiang (2012) for a review). Finally, what I found as a gap in methodology is **how the social network and semantic network are linked together** in your approach.\n \nThe information regarding the semantic social network, i.e. the co-occurrence network needs improvement in presentation both in text and figures. More precisely, the visual information displayed in Figure 3 does not correspond to the textual one. In order to improve the clarity of the presentation as well as the robustness of your study, please review the following:\n\n**AC DONE** It is not clear whether the co-occurrence network map is filtered for k>=6 as mentioned in Figure 3 on page 13 or for k>=5 as indicated on page 12 and page 11 (\u201cwith edges with number of co-occurrences k<5 filtered out\u201d)\nWhich is the correct one?\n\n**AC DONE** Relating to the previous point, it is not very clear why you have selected the specific number of co-occurrences. A more elaborate description of the generation of the semantic social network and the methodological choices at this stage would be fruitful.\n\n**AC DONE** Is the network map a directed or undirected graph? While on page 10 you mention that it is undirected, the explanation on parenthesis indicates the opposite. Please report the right one.\n\n**AC DONE** Please report the right colors of the respective nodes as displayed in the network map. For example, it is mentioned in the text that the node \u2018legality\u2019 is illustrated with the color blue while it is actually green in Figure 3. This might not be a major problem per se but adding the poor quality of the figure\u2019s image creates certain ambiguities concerning the thoughtfulness of your research design.\n\n**AH + others** I am curious, and suspect other readers will be, as well, as to what the nodes on Figure 3 (e.g. climate change, death, cultural difference) which are not connected with the main part of the network map represent. Please add an explanation of these nodes and what they mean in relation to the big picture of the co-occurrence network map.\n \n**AC and MM DONE but maybe @markomanka wants to have a look?** While you provide some interesting implications of your study concerning policy-making, these seem to be more like interpretations that one could make just by looking at the co-occurrence network map. In relation to that, I would encourage you to focus more on the statistical results of the semantic social network analysis which would allow you to consider the most prominent codes as well as include some excerpts of them providing supporting evidence.\n \n**AH (+ others)** The section on \u2018ethnographic coding as compression\u2019 seems like a promising avenue for further developing this methodological approach. My question, however, is how does it differ from the coding and meaning saturation as performed in a traditional thematic analysis?\n \nOverall, I think that semantic social network analysis is an important and interesting approach which has the potential to contribute and advance the qualitative analysis of long texts and/or social media posts from a large number of informants. I hope that these comments will help you to improve this study. Best of luck!\n \nReferences\n \nBeaulieu, A. (2004).

Though this paper\u2019s described technique has potential, the contribution it occluded by the fact that the authors do not engage the research of a now substantial body of mixed methods ethnographers, who aim to connect qualitative ethnography and quantitative analysis, including some work that does so utilizing network perspectives (Gravlee, Johnson, McCarty) and is specifically aimed at collaborative digital ethnography (Dengah and Snodgrass).\n \nSome questions:\nThough network perspectives are used, the focus is on associations between edges, rather than on network structures, such as the many betweenness and centrality metrics. **AC** This seems like a missed opportunity, and makes me question the argued greater utility of a network approach compared to other association metrics and data reduction techniques. **GM** I suggest the authors consult work by mixed methods ethnographers such as Gravlee, Johnson, and McCarty for ideas on how to expand this network analysis to include structural metrics.\n\n**AH DONE** The argument is made that this approach is superior to an iterative approach, where one moves, for example, from ethnography to survey. The authors suggest that this provides for more openness (p. 4) and less framing bias (p. 19). I\u2019m not convinced by this. Other iterative approaches (such as work by Dressler) provide for flexibility. And the biases inherent in coding data such as this would seem to at least equal other kinds of survey response biases. But the bigger point is that without a serious engagement with this other work, it\u2019s difficult to evaluate these claims. The engagement instead of work by purely qualitative ethnographers of life online such as Boellstorff and others seems ill-advised.\n\n**AH DONE** Even closer to the point, mixed methods ethnographic, survey, and social network research by Dengah, Snodgrass, and their lab on virtual worlds directly addresses the issues grappled with in this ms. There are many examples, but two particularly relevant pieces are:\nDengah, Snodgrass, et al. 2018. \u201cThe Social Networks and Distinctive Experiences of Intensively Involved Online Gamers: A Novel Mixed Methods Approach.\u201d Computers in Human Behavior.\n\nSnodgrass, Dengah, et al. 2017. \u201cOnline Gaming Involvement and Its Positive and Negative Consequences: A Cognitive Anthropological \u2018Cultural Consensus\u2019 Approach to Psychiatric Measurement and Assessment.\u201d Computers in Human Behavior.\n\n**AH DONE** The approach seems a lot like the semantic network approach Bernard, Wutich, and Ryan describe in their book (Analyzing Qualitative Data), grounded theory too (also discussed there), neither of which are referenced. Indeed, I\u2019d say that the techniques share a lot in common with semantic concept maps and visualizations, which can be readily produced in programs such as Maxqda. Again, for the authors\u2019 contribution to come through, the field\u2019s current perspectives and tools need to be engaged.\n\n**AH + AC DONE** The closing pages of the manuscript (pp. 17-20) speculate on issues such as the open science movement. Many of the points seem to apply to most of the sources I cite above, rather than specifically to the technique that is the focus of the manuscript. I\u2019d rather see there a more sustained discussion of this technique\u2019s advantages compared to some of the other approaches I cite above, with perhaps special focus on the iterative ethnography > survey (> sometimes back to ethnography) techniques I reference.\n_________________________________________\n \n\n## reviewer #4\n \nThe authors present an applied and exploratory/ inductive research project where they constructed social networks in which nodes (participants in an online community) are linked through codes that ethnographers assigned to the conversation between pairs of agents.\n \nThe papers has several strengths:\nThe paper translates terms and procedures from social network analysis and text analysis into ethnographic terminology and processes. This work can help ethnographers to adopt research methods from network analysis and text analysis for work in their discipline, thus bringing gaps between disciplines and helping to promote interdisciplinary work. \n\nThe authors are doing an excellent job of demonstrating several meaningful applications of the constructed two-mode networks for research questions and scenarios common in ethnography. This work shows the usefulness of using semantic networks analysis and text analysis in ethnography.\nThe paper can be improved by considering the following comments:\nMethods:\n\n**AH DONE** The coding of conversations is interesting. I recommend providing more details on how that work was done. Did some prior theory about health related interactions or online support groups (see work by Moira Burke) guide the identification of codes? How long did it take? What do costs in terms of time and coders mean for scalability?\n\nBackground:\n\n**AH DONE** There is a large body of literature on using ethnographic methods for studying online communities, and conducting qualitative coding of text data generated in online communities.

We did not plan to get into any long-term alliances in this space.\n\n**And yet, we have decided to make an exception, and sign a partnership agreement with [Climate-KIC](https://www.climate-kic.org/who-we-are/what-is-climate-kic/)** (some formal checks are still pending). Climate-KIC is the EU's largest public-private partnership, tasked with addressing climate change through innovation by achieving deep decarbonization across cities, while tackling land use, agriculture and industrial manufacturing, and securing finance. It works with 280 partners across academia, business, the public sector and NGOs, and has supported more than 2,000 startups to date, leveraging more than \u20ac2.5bn in funding. \n\nHere is why.\n\n## 1. Climate change needs all hands on deck\n\nWe believe climate change is the defining challenge of our time. It trumps other challenges, because we can't fix anything  if we don't survive first. Back when we started, we used to talk about \"resilience\" a lot. Since then, climate science has hardened. We now have a better idea of what we are looking at: a toxic mix of heavy weather, rising sea levels, habitat destruction, new fancy diseases and desertification. This mix, in turn, causes social turmoil, including poverty, displacement, forced migration. And what do we have to fight all that? Goodwill, and makeshift toolboxes of solar panels and dry toilets. We are not even making a dent. \n\nThis is not good enough. **We need to reallocate our best resources to climate-proofing humanity.** We have not done it before, because the conditions to leverage that kind of work were not in place.\n\nBack in 2012, as the Edgeryders community was coming together, Vinay Gupta wrote this:\n\n[quote=\"hexayurt, post:1, topic:1640\"]\n*There is a strange melancholy at seeing such a gathering of beautiful people chipping away at these problems, sometimes with explosive force, and saying \"yes, but all together, it is not enough.\" When you start measuring our impacts against the actual size of the problems, it becomes clear we have to break the old frames to get enough leverage to effect change.*\n[/quote]\n\n\n**Those conditions, it seems, are finally about to change.**\n\n\n## 2. Climate-KIC is moving with the determination we want to see\u2026\n\nUnder new management, Climate-KIC seems to have embraced the urgency like few other human institutions, at least in Europe. In their space, this means being grim and hopeful at the same time; starting new and bold programs that they are not sure yet how to deliver. They understand that any delay is self-harming at best, and predatory at worst - and that done is way better than perfect. Their senior management \u2013 and their [overachieving, intimidating CEO](https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/warning-we-must-step-up-fight-against-climate-change-meet-kirsten-dunlop-head-of-climatekic-36820574.html) \u2013 appear to support their staff in \"going out and breaking things\", if that brings results.\n\nAnd that gives us the chance to break the \"strange melancholy\" that Vinay noticed back in 2012.\n\n## 3. \u2026 but they need help\n\nIn these situations, we expect a certain amount of shooting from the hip. This is not necessarily a bad thing, because you can almost always adjust your aim as you go. Climate change won&rsquo;t wait for us to perfect our strategies, so it&rsquo;s absolutely critical to get things started. Climate-KIC have proven to be good at starting things, setting ambitious targets, mobilizing financial support, convening lots of public sector institutions, private companies, and universities.\n\nBut good is not enough: the task at hand is so enormous they would have to be superhuman. Superpowers are not on the menu, but they could get the next best thing: your help. The help of us all, in fact. Together, we have accumulated a capital of domain- and local expertise; relationships with underutilized &ldquo;unusual suspect&rdquo; actors at the edge of society; [little-known solutions](/t/9141) that are already working at the local scale and only need a push to multiply their impact. This capital must now become a trellis for the climate effort to build on.\n\n## 4. What we will do in all this\n\nIn a way, this is the perfect storm that the Edgeryders community has been preparing for. The sane, sensible solutions have failed to deliver. All that's left are trying the weird, scary ones. Desperate times call for radical measures, and rational, unflinching radicalism is what we grew out of, and where we belong. The need is so great that the people on the edge might find themselves at the center of the action: in a sense, the climate crisis might turn out to be a great equalizer.\n\nHere is how we plan to help:\n\n1. **Develop a new Edgeryders team**. There's plenty of expertise in the other 5,000 people who have created Edgeryders accounts, and plenty more out there: but we need a lens to focus it all, advocate for a radical, [solarpunk](https://www.appropedia.org/Solarpunk) approach to climate change, and find the resources needed for that approach to make a difference. We are calling the new team **EarthOS**. This name was invented a decade ago by our co-founder @matthias, as he was working on an open source \"[operating system for the planet](https://ma.juii.net/blog/earthos-0-13)\" that would allow everyone to live in personal freedom, community autonomy, and reasonable prosperity. We are claiming this tradition as a central part of Edgeryders. We hired @ilaria to coordinate the team. \n1. **Contribute to building a culture of rational radicalism in Climate-KIC and the European climate policy space in general**. The emphasis being on the word \u201cculture\u201d. We need a much better intellectual arsenal. Not just \u201csolutions\u201d, but a solid, transmissible, system-level understandings of the sort of transformation we, as a civilization, are trying to achieve. A perfect example is how climate activism is being held in check by economic insecurity: as all past prosperity has been built on the destruction of nature, too many people are unable to see a future for themselves in a post-carbon world, and stall the necessary change. We need to respond by controlling the narrative. But, a winning narrative requires solid cultural underpinning. That is why we are engineering [a collaboration between science fiction authots and economists](/t/8534) to imagine completely different economic systems.\n2. **Connect the Climate-KIC funding streams with radical ideas and delivery capacity**. Climate-KIC is, at the end of the day, a financial pipeline with advanced strategic capacity. Their core business is shifting (EU) money where it can make the most difference towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. Their impact depends on the right kind of people and organizations stepping forward with good projects, and delivering them on time and on specs. We are going to work with them, to advocate for investing in small-and-nimble organizations, informal networks of citizens, hackers, solarpunks, and more. \n\n## 5. How and when we start \n**We start immediately with two projects**. One is an effort to bring solarpunk tech and ethics to Europe's ports. Another one is a prototype for deep green, social, affordable urban living. More are coming, and we will use this space to share information about what we do and recruit collaborators.\n\nSo, if you are already working on climate (in the broadest possible sense), or want to get involved, tell us about yourself and your work [here](/c/earthos). \n\n_Photo credit: [John](https://www.flickr.com/photos/shebalso/)_", "created_at": "2019-06-13 21:09:59.308512", "updated_at": "2019-07-31 21:08:05.756860", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1306, "wiki": false, "reads": 66, "score": 3275.2, "like_count": 14, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [1673], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 8, 1856, 3, 5, 1507, 3293, 4986, 2915, 4186, 3782, 5246, 4892, 3706], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26791, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 5024, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Hey, I guess I should do my part here as I \"manage\" the track.

You point here at the importance of gender balance in the decision in e-Democracy. This is, in my opinion, very important. \u00a0And there are two reasons why I see this might not be the case: Men are generally more aggressive when discussing (in general a man will have about 10 times more testosterone than a woman of the same age), and men might be more interested in the topic.\n\nIn a process where each person choses to sit at whatever table they want, it is difficult (or unethical) to balance the second one. Since no one is being excluded, would you force women to sit on the eGovernment table because the number of men and women are not balanced, when they rather do something else. Or would you kick off some men from the discussion so that the number of men and women are the same? Both options seem to me very questionable.\n\nOn a bigger scale, with enough men and women, the situation could be better risolved by making mirror institutions. For example two parliaments, one with only women, one with only men, and a law will have to pass thorugh both institutions to become a law. But those are representative institutions. On institutions where anyone can join it is quite unavidable a disparity between genders. \u00a0Matter of fact, statistically genders are interested on different things. I know of many people who thought this was cultural until they had a baby-boy and a baby-girl, and tried to educate them in a gender neutral way. The book the Female Brain will confirm you the differences.\n\nSo I am afraid it is unaviodable that there will be an unequa number of men and women at the table.\n\nThen there is the problem of making sure that everybody has an equal saying. And this I think is very important and much research needs to be done on this. But again, is it correct to frame this from a gender perspective? If we have 6 men, and 2 women, and each gender is given equal amount of time, then each women will have three times more time then their male collegues. This does not sound fair to me.\n\nWhat alternative would you suggest?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 10:04:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:02.955972", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 414, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51574, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9601, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Digital storyteller, expert online collaborator and a co-founder of Edgeryders.

About 60 people below 30 from all 28 countries were attending at the headquarters in Alicante. I had already attended the first workshop last summer.\n\nThe discussion fell largely into two categories: how to help vulnerable smaller or starting artists and how to help new entrepreneurs. Despite efforts by the organisation, open alternatives (CC, open source, public domain) were not part of the conversation so much. The generally prevailing mindset is protecting rather than sharing. \n\nThough, the attendees were brimming with energy as they learned about IP and were making plans to set up awareness raising projects in their respective countries. If we can show youngsters to be conscious about the impact IP has on their daily lives, we\u2019re already one step forward.\n\nAn advantage of outlier views is that people know the few proponents in their organisation - \u201cOpen Source? Go talk to that guy\u201d. That\u2019s how I got talking to Malcolm Bain, a lawyer, lector and advisor specialised in open source software. On a beach party in Alicante, of all places.\n\nMalcolm seemed happy with how open source software has evolved into a fundamental, albeit relatively invisible, part of our digital lives. He cited how most software is built on top of open source digital infrastructure. And that companies like Microsoft, IBM and Google are [big contributors](https://octoverse.github.com/) to open source software, contrary to what people might think. Whatever those numbers may mean, this can make an optimist hopeful.\n\nI asked Malcolm about the evolution from open source software to hardware and now wetware. He had not thought of open source biotech and was happily surprised. In his view, from seeing the open source software field mature, you need several basic things in place to develop open source biotech into a meaningful field.\n\nThe first are the basic tools you need in order to do biotech. As it stands, there are ample [open lab hardware projects](http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_Lab) around, as well as affordable basic instruments like the [Bento Lab](http://bento.bio/). Furthermore, the [BioBricks Foundation](https://biobricks.org/) is committed to growing a database of standard synthetic biology parts called \u2018BioBricks\u2019. \n\nAre we at the point where enough people can easily get going? Probably not, although DIYbio labs are helping. Legislation on GMOs (which is not necessarily a bad thing) is another hurdle that prevents people to easily contribute to a project like Open Insulin, as the project revolves around engineering microorganisms. Our own struggles to find a certified lab in Belgium are a testimony of the extra barrier.\n\nSecond are people. A critical mass of contributors to biotech fundamentals is needed in order to make real progress, to make the efforts enjoyable and to keep going. A great example of a community driven effort in making biotech accessible is the annual [iGem](https://biobricks.org/) contest. And [DIYbio labs](http://www.diybio.org) are localised community hubs that play an important role as enablers and breeding grounds for open biology.\n\nLastly, Malcolm mentioned that you need to crowdsource or -fund all the effort being done to get rid of closed off knowledge. As an example, he referred to groups of lawyers systematically fighting patent by patent to open up knowledge for the public. This requires a degree of coordination.\n\nThe latter is where most projects are lacking, including Open Insulin. The Oakland group is organised well enough locally to progress, but it\u2019s not resilient and the collaboration does not scale well, locally and internationally. Coordination is expensive in time and/or money. It is where I am investing most of my time at the moment.\n\n\n###Collaboration frameworks\n\nA few months ago, when starting Open Insulin, I had predicted that the global collaboration would be autopilot mode due to the clear incentives of sharing information and experience across teams globally. The difficulty would mainly be to keep the local collaboration going. I referred to the overhead costs and energy that goes into putting people and resources together productively.\n\nReality so far has been the opposite: the international collaboration has proven more difficult than the local one. The main reason is an obstructed flow of information. One of the theoretical advantages of joining a project, rather than starting a new project, is that there is plenty of work to start from. \n\nYet, if the information is not curated, this can be a hindrance rather than an advantage. In an environment with limited organisation of information, only those involved from the beginning have a good enough overview (from legacy) to have access to all the right information. Anthony from Open Insulin in Oakland mentions in [his OpenVillage session proposal](https://edgeryders.eu/t/organizing-the-open-science-behind-open-insulin/826) that the latter is a local problem as well.\n\nFor us in Belgium, picking up where CCL was at, meant incomplete information and overlay in communication. These delays did have an effect on the morale in the team in Ghent. BioFoundry in Sydney decided to take a whole new approach from scratch, and they are now moving forward with research at a more rapid pace.\n\nIn search for solutions, I\u2019ve looked into Aquarium, a lab automation tool in development at the University of Washington, and the Open Science Framework (OSF). On OSF, there are other open, large scale global collaborations such as the [Reproducibility Project: Psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology](https://osf.io/e81xl/). They can serve as good examples of how to organise similar projects. \n\n\n###Biohackathon\n\nOn 8 and 9 July, [Waag Society](http://waag.org/en/lab/open-wetlab) &amp; [Digi.bio](https://digi.bio/) hosted the first Amsterdam biohackathon. It brought together biohackers from the Netherlands and surrounding countries like Belgium &amp; Germany, but even Canada. All in all it was an international bunch, which made it a pleasant biohacking community gathering.\n\nWe were there with a Belgian delegation of 5 people, all involved with the Open Insulin project group in Ghent. We came to get to know and play around with the microfluidic chips developed by digi.bio. Microfluidic devices have the potential to accelerate the way biotechnology research is done, and the open source version makes it possible for communities such as biohackerspaces to reap the same benefits.\n\nI was also planning to meet Tom, who is developing [cell-free extracts](http://cell-free.tech/). In essence, this extract allows people to do genetic engineering with the soup that\u2019s inside a bacteria, without the actual living microorganism. Legally, this is big, as working with live microorganisms often means legal &amp; financial barriers. Yet anyone can work legally and simply with cell-free extract.\n\nFor Open Insulin, and open source protein engineering in general, this technology offers opportunities. If we can somehow make the potential reality for the open source community, it's a solid step towards democratization of scientific research. In other words: plenty to talk about at the hackathon.\n\nWhen thinking of a collaboration on using cell-free extracts for Open Insulin, we quickly came to the known issue: how do we collaborate efficiently in open.citizen science projects?\n\nWe sat down with a few people to discuss &amp; brainstorm. The group came up with a plan outline that we will try to implement over the next months in the hopes it boosts the Open Insulin collaboration. Hopefully, other citizen.open science projects can also benefit from the approach as we test it out.\n\n###Train lecture\n\nOn the train ride back from Amsterdam, I read [this work](https://freerads.org/science-scope-full/) on putting science in perspective. Then I read [this captivating article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science) on how large publishers rose to power. The system is not conducive of science done primarily for the greater good. It runs on other incentives: those of publishing, patenting and money. What we do as biohackers and with projects like Open Insulin is political, and needed.\n\nIn 2001, then Microsoft CEO [Steve Ballmer called Linux \u201ca cancer\u201d](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/). Today, as a mastodont company whose legacy is primarily built on proprietary software, Microsoft is embracing open source more and more. Let\u2019s see where this biotech thing goes.\n\nIn the next weeks I continue to study open science collaborations, looking at success factors and guidelines to copy. I\u2019m planning to visit Counter Culture Labs in Oakland, home of the original Open Insulin group, in September to help organise the collaboration.\n\n\n\n_This blogpost has been realised as part of the OpenCare Community Fellowship Program with the support of SCImPULSE Foundation._", "created_at": "2017-07-31 13:35:49.133406", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 17:46:16.350789", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1514, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 683.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3707], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49699, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9061, "post_number": 80, "raw": "@amelia is it \"authorize, mobilize\" etc. or \"authorise, mobilise\" etc.?", "created_at": "2018-12-28 00:27:36.087497", "updated_at": "2018-12-28 00:27:36.087497", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [49698], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49667, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9061, "post_number": 62, "raw": "We are still at 7,217... happy Xmas to you!", "created_at": "2018-12-26 12:38:45.926220", "updated_at": "2018-12-26 12:38:45.926220", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [49661], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53139, "user_id": 5048, "topic_id": 9719, "post_number": 2, "raw": "There is dire need to put theater back to people, in front of small markets and restaurants in rural areas, They are rapidly disappearing and we wont to stop that by cultural initiatives.

It has previously been described as a process of online activities that accelerates offline activities.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe EdgeRyders process begins when an idea or solution is posted on the platform, sparking discussion among community members. Some join in, actively listening, asking questions or giving thoughtful responses. (This is a safe place and not for debating opinions or speaking for others.)\n\nThe discussion begins with first hand accounts of attempts taken to solve societal issues and moves to navigating the personal challenges experienced by members. Nuances and the various different contexts surrounding these challenges begins to show. \n\n**Information analysis**\n\nNext open source technology is used to make connections between topics being discussed, the people discussing them, places, projects, solutions and struggles. When we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources. \n\nBy the end of the process, our community members have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action. \n\n.... \nThe word that I have come up with is \u201cAnnares\u201d. It\u2019s the name of the Utopian world in Ursula K Le Guin\u2019s novel the Dispossed. \n\nThe visualization Alberto of EdgeRyders work over the past eight years shows a changing organism. It\u2019s like a city or a society that\u2019s alive and fluid, growing and changing. The conversations on EdgeRyders are changing and adapting as society changes and adapts and new challenges arise.\n\nLe Guin\u2019s novel was the first critical Utopian novel because her world of Annares wasn\u2019t cut off from earth (or Uras in the novel). Prior to her novel, utopian fiction\u2019s \u2018perfect societies\u2019 were always isolated and static places. People from the real world couldn\u2019t reach them and history and politics had no influence or impact. To the reader they were almost less achievable.\n\nIn Le Guin\u2019s novel someone from earth (or Uras) reached Anarres, which breaks this trope and shows that a better imagined society is possible for us. Annares is an evolving place (that\u2019s not without its faults). \n\nIn the novel, Annares was established by Odo as a decentralised socialist state where a new society and language were created. Everything is shared or used as opposed to owned. There are no \u2018criminals\u2019 because everyone is equal - in fact, there\u2019s not a word for crime or criminal in their language. Many other social constructs are challenged in the book too.\n\nI think it\u2019s a fitting word for the medium EdgeRyders uses. Like the city in The Dispossessed, EdgeRyders uses a decentralised network to help change society. It\u2019s ever evolving and changing just like Le Guin\u2019s world.\n\nHappy to hear your feedback and thoughts, \nLaura", "created_at": "2020-06-10 15:12:46.469838", "updated_at": "2020-06-10 16:17:45.721665", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 500, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 57.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5667], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52589, "user_id": 5037, "topic_id": 9705, "post_number": 34, "raw": "I'm in. :)", "created_at": "2019-04-16 03:25:16.723530", "updated_at": "2019-04-16 03:25:16.723530", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 38, "score": 107.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77538, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13402, "post_number": 21, "raw": "[quote=\"nadia, post:1, topic:13402\"]\nSummit event: **[Reorganising the provision of goods & services to secure material basis of livelihoods.

What I'm meaning by 'conditions' is more the environment, the enabling factors - rather than 'contractual conditions'. For me it connects to new understandings about the kind of leadership called for by emergent and uncertain times - leaders as architects, creating the containers for things to happen, self organise in a desirable way - rather than the old command and control models. I particularly love <a href=\"http://margaretwheatley.com/\">Margaret Wheatley</a>'s early work on this area.\n\nWhat might these look like in practice? I think it will be a combination of the factors you go on to mention; culture, values, new skills, awarenesses\u00a0and practices. That is what I'm keen to explore as part of this theme of open care. There seems to be (particularly in this area of the public sector) an over-emphasis on interventions and policies that are quite entrenched in\u00a0a command-and-control mindset. What is called for to engable\u00a0self-organising, citizen-led responses to welfare needs of our fellow citizens? Also how this might pull the wider structures of our society and the non-health determinants of human flourishing in to formations that are less likely to deplete and more likely to\u00a0generate\u00a0greater heatlh.\n\nI'm still trying to articulate this theme clearly enough so as to connect with others engaged in connected work who may be open to contributing a session at the Open Village in October. Do you know of anyone that would be worth\u00a0contacting?\n\nthanks\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-16 10:21:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:41.772629", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 280, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62878, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11320, "post_number": 27, "raw": "This is a great discussion, and it should be public.

I admit that the way it's running right now in the House is \"not broken\", but I am looking for [a solution](/t/openvillage-solutions-list/7566) that would work (1) long-term and (2) generically in all kinds of OpenVillage Houses. Beyond the initial excitement of having such a House project, which admittedly makes it very simple to run a House, even to a nice standard.\n\nAnd the current setup is not a valid candidate for that, for various reasons:\n\n1. **There are never \"no rules\".** Informal organizing comes with its own rules, they are just not made explicit. People spend a lot of time trying to figure out what these rules are. (For example, I still don't know if it's acceptable to leave un-done dishes in the kitchen when you use one or two items in the evening and leave, as the last one.) All this beating around the bush is a waste of mental processing capacity and time, and the \"failing on the safe side\" approach to assume stricter rules if one is still unsure leads to doing work that could have been avoided. Which is contrary to simplicity, \"the art of maximizing the amount of work not done\".\n\n2. **Competing for household performance wastes valuable time.** I am wondering why I am not getting any significant amount of work done here, and one reason is for sure the higher standard of household work. Now when the \"informal organization\" is set up in such a way that there is a built-in silent competition for better cleaning, better food etc. \u2026 everyone doing more work than they would need for themselves and more than they expect from others \u2026 how is this possibly a good thing? If this wastes only 2% of a person's wake time that is still 19 minutes every day, 117 hours a year.\n\n3. **Implicit rules breed divisions.** This is not visible in the short term, but definitely in the longer term. Given that the (real or perceived) implicit rules deviate from personal standards, people tend to silently (re-)negotiate them by stretching them \u2026 without talking about them, because that is a well-accepted taboo in this \"informal organization\" style. The result is \"unspoken conflict\" by people with different ideas about what the rules _should_ be.\n\n4. **It leads to a lack of investment.** Your standing in the group depends on your perceived share of the housework. If an informal mode of organization is in place, this \"perceived share\" means \"when you see others at work\". Obviously, as there is simply no other (formal or explicit) way to observe who does what. This situation bends the choice of tasks more towards the visible ones, so especially towards cooking and cleaning, even to the degree of overdoing them.

Thank you for taking the time to tell this story. It resonated with me on several levels. Especially the part about people not being peers due to differing degrees of choice. I've seen it in my own extended family where within my lifetime I saw cousins move from subsistence- level farming in rural Africa to join the middle class in Khartoum in one generation. A big part of the reason was that the first generation (my father's) who went out into the world supported the people in the village continuously sending a big chunk of their incomes back to their families for a significant part of their working lives. My father's generation never saw themselves as \"benefactors\" or somehow above the families they were supporting even though this was quite a responsibility ( 7 sisters and their families in my Dad's case). They just did what people who care about each other do; they carried the burden because they had broad enough shoulders; they saw themselves as helping peers.\n\nWhen we were younger, I didn't notice that my family could seldom afford much material consumption- I had the fortune of spending my early pre-teens in a school where many of my classmates parents were academics and so not having much money was never really an issue. When I entered highschool I was suddenly in an extremely well of part of the country and the contrast suddenly became very very clear and stigmatising; when I was in an environment surronded by peers everything was possible because it felt like we were all in the same boat and so we just went about learning, playing and just being kids with each other. In contrast in the environment where I felt that my range of choices ( for professions, for lifestyles etc) was more restricted than that of others suddenly many many things felt impossible even though objectively speaking they weren't. It all has to do with perception...\n\nI think your Every1Tutuor project looks interesting, I watched the video but still don't feel I really understand the concept- is there more information about it somewhere?

As I see it, the climate crisis is a human matter and we should treat it like that. It involves our way of living and, ultimately, our connections to others, our emotions. As every changing moment in our lives, as in every crisis, we can choose how to react: to be conservative and behave like we always did (the way that brought us to the crisis, actually) or to adapt to a terrifying scenario that we can't pretend it's not there. As the crisis is a major one, we have to committ ourselves to a major or _deep_ adaptation.  \n\nWhat Bendell suggests about resilience, relinquishment and restoration is, in my opinion, also a psychological and cognitive process to face. As different studies start to report, there is something called \"eco-anxiety\" that affects more and more people ([this article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/b2e7ee32-ad28-4ec4-89aa-a8b8c98f95a5) suggests the our Bendell has something to do with it). The geographical scale of the impact makes it invisible and, at the same time, overwhelming for any person. We can react with different shades of denial and / or feel totally powerless. OR, even accepting the anxiety coming with it, shift from the individual to the communal and work actively to this radical transformation our societies need. \n\nWhat I intend to highlight, here, is that we shouldn't forget the human side and the importance of emotions to succeed. \n\nSo, @GrahamCaswell when you say:\n\n> my focus is on visibility - on making climate change visible. This involves internalising the cost of climate change into the price of everything (carbon pricing), making full and accessible information on the carbon content and climate consequences for every carbon-intensive activity (carbon labeling), and giving investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders full information on the carbon content and climate risk of every significant organisation (carbon and climate disclosure). My thesis and argument is that \u201cthe market\u201d is not free or rational or effective without full information (including price and disclosure information) being available to every participant at the point of every spending or investment decision.\n\nI think this is a good move and I thank you for the work you're doing in Ireland and at a larger scale. Nonetheless, I personally see it as a short term move or a stage in the path to reach more awareness among a wide public. But I don't know if \"the market\" will be the same in a not so long frame of time and I don't know if we have to keep playing by someone else's book.

At its core are pillars of the OpenCare two year research on community alternatives to health and social care. Everywhere we look, from the hyperlocal to the international, people are committed to building solutions. There is a nascent, ambitious, and effective ecosystem of care that is developing in response to the failures of the current models.  We aim to highlight and support that development. \n\nThe structure of the program brings together sessions built around three themes: Open Science, Architecture of Love, and Revolutionary Care. The themes blend and build on one another, reflective of the fundamental interdependence of care. Three fellows were selected from the variety of participants to help curate and develop the three themes as well as the festival itself.    \n\nOne of OpenCare\u2019s core themes has been citizen science and Open Science. Many projects are producing highly promising products and outputs. \"We have no capital, no investors, no shares\" - Winnie Poncelet has lined up a number of both researchers and champions of affordable and accessible technology for care who are on a learning path to improve coordination and distribute team efforts and value accordingly.  \n\nArchitectures of Love is evoking an important thematic tension between policy and values. Gehan Macleod condensed her question to an essential perspective, asking what foundational parts of a culture contribute to a caregiving society that go beyond formally enforced policies. Experiences from the City of Milano, from community groups in Galway and Glasgow are a few ways to understand what are enablers for citizen-led care responses. \n\nRevolutionary Care: Building Health Autonomy is the third theme of the festival.  As we talk about care, we are working to understand how we can live together and how we can develop our lives in commune. We ask the questions around responding to crisis, responding to our needs, and building generational models of care. Finally, as we face the destruction around us, we strive to highlight care as a fundamentally revolutionary act. The Woodbine Health Autonomy collective (represented by Nicole Demby and Frank Coughlin) based in New York City, has curated this theme. \n\nWe know this festival will be more than another \u201cpassive\u201d conference.  The lines between presenter and audience are purposefully blurred and as we have worked to build the Edgeryders community, we will take the information and use it to build tangibly.  The first two days will highlight the work of different projects and groups around the world.  We look to meet new friends, share embraces with old ones, and learn together.  On the third day, we will experiment together as we continue in the process of building new worlds that place our collective well-being at the forefront. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe look forward to walking this path with you.  \n\n\nGehan, Noemi, Nicole, Frank, Winnie\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/742e15f9eeb5e5708177944b2c7e3869abf0c435.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"98\">\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 100%; table-layout:fixed;\">\n\t\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13n7DYa8_9_n_qSlbkyZRZCJMsOXlq97DjErEf7zMcVk/edit?usp=drive_web\n\nOutdated:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yw9RDK6ym-NfNAQy9i5clCz4cWDYmH1q5LO5IdQt32Y/edit?usp=sharing", "created_at": "2017-08-03 23:37:50.501281", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 06:11:25.543459", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 522, "wiki": false, "reads": 59, "score": 306.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3613, 3, 3769, 3801], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73932, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 13116, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Blivande has now produced at least 700 of these smocks for local clinics and care facilities.

In this conversation we brushed on several topics and issues that together are resulting in EU and national policies stifling the ability of European companies to successfully compete with Chinese and US tech actors, and the values they espouse:\n\n1. That we get lots of new policy on top of existing policy with redundancy and the implications of this in the long run.\n\n2. The conflict between well-intended European Policymakers and national governments.\n\n3. Role of standards bodies and how different actors relate to/navigate/use them.\n\n4. The general difference between how US / China / EU institutions and national governments acts/relates to its technologies/goes about policy making / regulation.\n\nWe also discussed which skills, expertise and strategic alliances are needed to improve the situation. And how Edgeryders could better leverage our growing reach and presence in EUrope to contribute to this.\n\nRather than try to sum up the contents of a 3 hour, deeply technical conversation I have set this post up as a wiki for all of us to help flesh out one or more of the points above.

Cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 ludzi pracuje w administracji, ale wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 to robotnicy, majstry. Z wyj\u0105tkiem garstki nauczycieli, to raczej ma\u0142o tutaj inteligencji. Przed wojn\u0105 80% mieszka\u0144c\u00f3w stanowili \u017bydzi- wszystkich wywieziono ich do Treblinki. Generalnie skromnie si\u0119 tutaj \u017cyje. Sporym problemem jest obecnie nadu\u017cywanie alkoholu. W sumie zawsze tak by\u0142o. Powszechne s\u0105 tzw. \"stojaki\" czyli panowie, kt\u00f3rzy popijaj\u0105 w zasadzie ca\u0142y czas, robi\u0105 rozruby. Znam ten obrazek te\u017c z dzieci\u0144stwa, to zawsze by\u0142o u nas obecne. Ja zawsze mia\u0142em sw\u00f3j \u015bwiat i trzyma\u0142em si\u0119 z boku i nie uczestniczy\u0142em w tym &quot;zawadiackim&quot; \u015bwiecie. \n\nZawsze du\u017co si\u0119 udziela\u0142em, w szczeg\u00f3lno\u015bci w naszej dru\u017cynie pi\u0142karskiej. Z ch\u0142opakami st\u0105d gra\u0142em w pi\u0142k\u0119, chodzili\u015bmy na ryby, ale trzyma\u0142em si\u0119 z dala od alkoholu. Raczej omin\u0105\u0142 mnie ten okres g\u0142upiego dorastania. Mia\u0142em sw\u00f3j plan, mia\u0142em co robi\u0107 i nie nudzi\u0142o mi si\u0119 za bardzo. Je\u017adzi\u0142em na niemiecki do Siedlec, na treningi pi\u0142ki no\u017cnej, po nocach uczy\u0142em si\u0119 Linuxa. Powa\u017cnie raczej podchodzi\u0142em do \u017cycia. Dlaczego wyjecha\u0142em? Od dziecka nasza rodzina mia\u0142a jakie\u015b zwi\u0105zki z Niemcami. M\u00f3j brat starszy brat wcze\u015bnie wyjecha\u0142 do Niemiec. Wyjazdy te da\u0142y mi dost\u0119p do innego troch\u0119 bardziej otwartego \u015bwiata. To pomog\u0142o mi wzmocni\u0107 moj\u0105 opozycj\u0119 do prostego my\u015blenia, kt\u00f3rego do\u015bwiadcza\u0142em w mojej spo\u0142eczno\u015bci, rozumianego jako: robi\u0107 to co inni i tak jakinni bez przestrzeni na bycie sob\u0105. Przynajmniej tak to wcze\u015bniej postrzega\u0142em. \n\nR\u00f3wnocze\u015bnie do\u015b\u0107 krytycznie odnosi\u0142em si\u0119 do relacji mi\u0119dzy lud\u017ami. Tak, troch\u0119 by\u0142omi tutaj za ciasno. To konserwatywne podej\u015bcie mi uwiera\u0142o. Klasyczny plan na \u017cycie, p\u0142yni\u0119cie z g\u0142\u00f3wnym nurtem nie by\u0142y dla mnie. Stara\u0142em si\u0119 otacza\u0107 lud\u017ami, kt\u00f3rzy widzieli to podobnie. Mia\u0142em swoich ludzi. Ale wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 z nich wyjecha\u0142a. Wszyscy moi bliscy, z kt\u00f3rymi czu\u0142em wi\u0119\u017a &quot;\u015bwiatopogl\u0105dow\u0105&quot;, wyjechali. Nie wyjecha\u0142em do Niemiec wy\u0142\u0105cznie po to, \u017ceby zarobi\u0107, co cz\u0119sto nie mie\u015bci si\u0119 w g\u0142owach mieszka\u0144c\u00f3w mojego miasteczka. Kultura, j\u0119zyk, w\u0142a\u015bnie mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 poznania innego my\u015blenia, podr\u00f3\u017cowanie, po prostu inne \u017cycie, to by\u0142o to co mnie poci\u0105ga\u0142o. Jak ju\u017c to zrobi\u0142em, to wiele os\u00f3b mnie za to podziwia\u0142o, ale zanim do tego dosz\u0142o, to starali si\u0119 mnie na r\u00f3\u017cne, najcz\u0119\u015bciej nieu\u015bwiadomione sposoby zniech\u0119ci\u0107. Mo\u017ce jaki\u015b strach si\u0119 z tym wi\u0105za\u0142. Le\u017c\u0105ce nieopodal Siedlce s\u0105 do\u015b\u0107 konserwatywnym o\u015brodkiem, przy tym do\u015b\u0107 ma\u0142omiasteczkowym, czasami a\u017c tandetnym. My\u015bl\u0119 tu o braku otwarto\u015bci, ciasnot\u0119 mentaln\u0105 widoczne zach\u0142y\u015bni\u0119cie si\u0119 b\u0142yszcz\u0105c\u0105 Warszaw\u0105. Tutaj ma\u0142o jest inicjatyw kulturalnych, a raczej kolejne galerie handlowe. Odzywaj\u0105 si\u0119 kompleksy wobec wi\u0119kszych polskich miast. Wiele os\u00f3b pracuje w Warszawie i konfrontuje si\u0119 z ni\u0105 na co dzie\u0144, ale Siedlce to przede wszystkim miasto, do kt\u00f3rego przyje\u017cd\u017caj\u0105 ludzie z okolicznych wsi, co tworzy do\u015b\u0107 specyficzny klimat i styl. Oczywi\u015bcie to jest tylko m\u00f3j punkt widzenia, ale staram si\u0119 nazwa\u0107 wszystko to co spowodowa\u0142o, \u017ce st\u0105d wyjecha\u0142em. Nie widzia\u0142em tu dla siebie miejsca. Ten g\u0142\u00f3wny nurt mocno wp\u0142ywa\u0142 na m\u00f3j mikro\u015bwiat, na moje relacje. Nie potrafi\u0142em tego za bardzo pogodzi\u0107. \n\nMoi rodzice g\u0142osowali za PO, ale w moich stronach partie konserwatywne maj\u0105 znaczn\u0105 wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107. Mnie najbli\u017cej politycznie do Koriwna. Rozmawiaj\u0105c z lud\u017ami wyczuwam cz\u0119sto nastroje pe\u0142ne l\u0119ku przed \"konfidentami\", \"wrogami\", \"uchod\u017acami\". Kiedy\u015b o ma\u0142y w\u0142os nie pobi\u0142em si\u0119 z jednym go\u015bciem, bo nie spodoba\u0142o mi si\u0119 jak krzycza\u0142 &quot;Jeba\u0107 Niemc\u00f3w&quot;. To p\u00f3\u017aniej sta\u0142o si\u0119 to przedmiotem zainteresowania innych, \u017ce niby broni\u0142em Niemc\u00f3w. \n\nDlaczego ludzie tutaj g\u0142osuj\u0105 na prawice? My\u015bl\u0119, \u017c\u0119 to bierze si\u0119 w jakim\u015b stopniu z faktu, \u017ce nie poznaj\u0105 \"\u015bwiata\", siedz\u0105 na miejscu, kt\u00f3ry jest ich ca\u0142ym \u015bwiatem. W du\u017cej mierze te\u017c formatuje ich telewizja i to co w niej us\u0142ysz\u0105. A jako, \u017ce nie do\u015bwiadczaj\u0105 czego\u015b nowego, to si\u0119 wszelkich nowo\u015bci boj\u0105. To co jest sta\u0142e i od dawien dawna daje poczucie bezpiecze\u0144stwa. Pod\u0105\u017canie za rodzin\u0105 jest bardzo tutaj silne. Poza tym ludzie maj\u0105 du\u017co czasu wolnego, tutaj p\u0142ynie on inaczej. I za bardzo nie wiedz\u0105 co z tym czasem robi\u0107. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce strach gra tutaj jak\u0105\u015b wa\u017cn\u0105 rol\u0119 w tym obrazie. Strach przed innym, przed zmian\u0105 i strach przed tym, \u017ce utrac\u0119 to co mam. Frustracje, niezadowolenie z \u017cycia. Te zamieszki w Bia\u0142ymstoku to by\u0142o co\u015b mocnego. Jeszcze jak faceci krzyczeli has\u0142a: \"Zakaz peda\u0142owania\", albo \"; \"obro\u0144cy Ko\u015bcio\u0142a i kultury\"; to by\u0142o dla mnie co\u015b co znam, ale widzia\u0142em tam te\u017c du\u017co kobiet, kt\u00f3re w tym bra\u0142y udzia\u0142 i dziwnie mi si\u0119 tego s\u0142ucha\u0142o. Tyle w tym nienawi\u015bci. Moja dziewczyna zareagowa\u0142o na to bardzo emocjonalnie, m\u00f3wi\u0105c, \u017ce to jest jaka\u015b patologia, debile etc. \n\nCzasem s\u0142ucham sobie Korwina i chyba najbli\u017cej mi do niego. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce to bardzo inteligentny cz\u0142owiek. On bardzo racjonalnie, logicznie my\u015bli. Odwo\u0142uje si\u0119 do czego\u015b co jest dla mnie wa\u017cne, czyli do jak najmniejszej ingerencji pa\u0144stwa w \u017cycie obywateli. \u017beby spo\u0142eczno\u015bci same si\u0119 anga\u017cowa\u0142y do dzia\u0142ania i bra\u0142y odpowiedzialno\u015b\u0107. \u017beby nie czeka\u0142y na pa\u0144stwo, kt\u00f3ry na wszystkim k\u0142adzie \u0142ap\u0119 i chce mie\u0107 sw\u00f3j profit. Kiedy\u015b ch\u0142op musia\u0142 odda\u0107 jak\u0105\u015b dziesi\u0119cin\u0119 panu i mia\u0142 spok\u00f3j, a dzi\u015b trzeba oddawa\u0107 dziesi\u0119cin\u0119 na ka\u017cdym kroku. I najgorsze w tym wszystkim jest to, \u017ce u nas pa\u0144stwo nie dzia\u0142a. Jest niewydolne. No bo co dostajesz w zamian za te daniny? Mam por\u00f3wnanie do tego jak dzia\u0142a to w Niemczech i w zwi\u0105zku z tym nie mam problemu z tym, \u017ceby tam p\u0142aci\u0107 podatki. Moje wynagrodzenie mi w zupe\u0142no\u015bci wystarcza, cho\u0107 wcale nie haruj\u0119 jak w\u00f3\u0142, a druga sprawa, \u017ce urz\u0119dy DZIA\u0141AJ\u0104.

I am summarizing and copying key insights (in _Italic)_ for a quick read (**bolded** text my own).

Nearly 100m swing voters are up for grabs. There is no single issue on voters\u2019 minds; indeed, many are more worried about emigration than immigration. And many are more concerned about: Islamic radicalism (87m, 22 percent of the EU voting population); the rise of nationalism (45m, 11 percent); and the economy (63m, 16 percent). Just under 59m highlight migration as one of the top threats to Europe: only 15 percent of the EU voting population._\n\n1. Less tribalism, more volatility. **Notice how trust is key.** \n\n_Our research shows that, in this gaseous era of politics, the usual rules for predicting how voters are likely to behave no longer apply. Whereas vote choice and turnout are usually analysed as a function of socio-demographic factors, the upcoming election is driven more by issues. The probability of turning out in the election depends on what issues you care about, and there is also strong evidence for issue-based voting. But it is not only the position that leaders take on issues that matters; it is also their leadership and personalities, and the trust that people have in them. In other words: do leaders appear to embody the values and feelings of voters? Simply put, the rules of the election game have evolved._\n\n2. Open Europe vs closed nation states: **_What matters is for parties to be agents of change_**\n\n_The core divide is not one of wanting either an open Europe or a closed nation state, but between voters who think that the system is broken and those who think the status quo still basically works. [...] This dynamic take has a highly local flavour, one which does not necessarily result in a shift against mainstream parties. In countries where anti-Europeans are in power, they are the status quo \u2013 but, in countries where they are in opposition, they have significant influence. However, the key lesson from the study is that success in this election depends on the ability to position oneself as a credible agent of change. It is about offering good positions on issues people care about. But equally important is whether voters trust politicians to bring about this change._\n\n3. Despite headlines, it's not about migration.\n\n_The survey results show that a majority of people in every single country polled do not regard it as one of the top two issues facing their country. Hungary is the only country where immigration is still felt to be the number one threat to the EU. This is little wonder given the endless stream of propaganda that Orban puts out through his state-controlled media._ .\n[...]\n_There is a second reason migration is unlikely to work as a key driver of turnout at this year\u2019s election: even those who see migration as a top issue mean radically different things when they talk about it. In some countries, respondents likely associated \u201cmigration\u201d with emigration rather than immigration. Indeed, our research revealed a significant divide between those who worry predominantly about immigration in their countries and those who worry about emigration leading to a decline in the national population. While northern and western Europe still fears the inflow of outsiders, majorities in Greece, Italy, Spain, Hungary, Poland, and Romania are much more worried about their citizens leaving. **This leads to the spectacular finding that double-digit majorities in all these countries would like their governments to make it illegal for their own citizens to leave for long periods of time**._\n\n4. _Myth 4: The dividing line in Europe is between east and west_\n_The truth: East and west are not homogeneous, and there are important differences between, and within, north and south_\n\n_EU citizens in newer member states also seem less wary than their counterparts in older ones about the EU as a constraining force. This is perhaps explained by high levels of mistrust in corrupt national elites and weak national institutions in the east \u2013 meaning that they rate the EU higher by comparison. EU financial transfers may also play a role. And, when asked about the perceived consequences of EU membership, voters in Poland, Hungary, and Romania (along with Spain) were the most forceful in saying that EU membership protected against the excesses and failures of national governments._\n[...]\n_As the political crisis in the EU peaked from 2015, growing coordination between Visegrad states (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) contributed to an image of these central and eastern European countries as more closed to newcomers, and less supportive of international commitments to protect refugees, than those in the west of the EU. In fact, the survey suggests that this image does not have strong underpinning either._\n\n5. _Myth 5: All European elections are exclusively national_\n_The truth: This could be the first truly transnational European Parliament election_\n\n_..voters in countries such as Hungary, Poland, and Romania see the EU\u2019s role in protecting democracy, the rule of law, and human rights as vital. But there is also a great power dimension to their concerns: voters in France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Denmark, and Italy value the EU\u2019s ability to counter the US and China. Finally, citizens of the three Scandinavian EU members, together with the Netherlands and Austria, appreciate the EU\u2019s role in **tackling climate change**. This issue has the potential to be important in mobilising pro-European voters. The data suggest that people who worry about climate change tend to have more optimistic views of the EU, perhaps because they recognise it as an issue that goes beyond the nation state and requires collective action._\n\n_**In many member states, there are high levels of concern about the threat of nationalism to the EU\u2019s future among people who are likely to vote.**_\n\n_The outcome will be a new kind of \u2018hybrid election\u2019 \u2013 nationally grounded, but affected by debates elsewhere in Europe. This potential contagion adds to the unpredictability of the May 2019 vote: more than ever, an event in one EU member state could affect the election result in another._", "created_at": "2019-04-27 13:38:02.155426", "updated_at": "2019-04-27 15:25:12.753539", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1077, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 322.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4683, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70892, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 155, "raw": "@nadia, everything feels still quite normal here.

Then, maybe, website!</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/sholiloewenthal\">@SholiLoewenthal</a>, the idea of people meaningfully collaborating on the web for the common good is beautiful. Most people would agree we definitely need that. But such a system has two component: one technological, one human. The two interact in non-trivial ways.\u00a0\n\nSo far, we all agree (well, most, at least). But then, here's something that always puzzled me: when faced with this dream, most people set out writing code, and very few people set out building communities that share values and rules of interaction. Neither strategy is sufficient in itself: you need both. But in focusing on one, almost everybody chooses to focus on the technical component.\u00a0\n\nThe Edgeryders tech was 100% commodity at the start: just Drupal. Now it's a pretty sophisticated instantiation of Drupal, so maybe it's 80-90% a commodity. Edgeryders is cutting edge because of its human component: great, smart, generous people, who are teaching themselves to write instead of talk, and operate according to a shared social protocol. It's our rules of interaction, like \"who does the work call the shots\", that are fundamental enablers.\n\nWho does the work calls the shots means that nobody is authorized to tell anybody else \"don't do that\". If you don't like what I am doing, the only way that you have to get the community to see it your way is to do better than me. This frees us from cross-veto; empowers the doers; and dismisses the whiners. As a consequence, whiners leave and doers stay on. This is not encoded in the platform; it is encoded in the culture.\u00a0\n\nAt the next iteration, some culture gets encoded in the tech. For example, Edgeryders uses tasks, a Drupal module created for software developers, for coordinating around real-world activities (we are still driving adoption, only the most active and advanced edgeryders actually use it). Another example: we use wikis a lot. This both sustains and is sustained by the culture of open collaboration we share.\u00a0\n\nSo, you see: a strong enthusiasm for your vision is compatible with a skeptical attitude about a platform \u2013 even a good one. My discussion for this is <a href=\"/edgeryders-dev/user-manual#Intro\">here</a>.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-28 14:22:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:50.288252", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 402, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15943, "user_id": 1514, "topic_id": 2160, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Petri Nets</b>\n\nHello, as I told you on Twitter, I think that the diagram above is an example of Petri Net, where users are places and products are transitions.

Particularly, I wanted a realigned _timeline_, where everyone involved would know what happens next, and when. So I grilled @nadia and @matthias for information, and, with them, debugged loose ends and inconsistencies. This is the proposal that came out of this process. Feedback welcome.\n\n**Important**: it requires some reworking of the budget. Nadia is in charge of this, and will liaise with her team as needed.\n\n\n## Concept and rationale\n\n1. **We want to test an alternative model to the Silicon Valley-type startup incubator dedicated to social business and social innovation**. The idea is to make enough money to be prosperous and independent, but what really matters is to make sense: to give a meaning to our lives by doing something that we, and our communities, think makes a difference. This could be Yosser's third space, or Heba's promotion of cycling culture, of Baderdean's boosting of the use of open source software, or clowning, or aquaponics, or whatever. \n\n2. **The incubator model does not work for this stuff, because getting this kind of projects (not exclusively devoted to profit making) off the ground requires patient support**. The time scale is simply longer than  normal incubators can afford. Hence, the situation we are seeing: plenty of pitching competitions, small cash prizes, then the idea fizzles out, the proponent loses steam or burns out, and we are back to where we started.\n\n3. **Patient support is unsustainable and undesirable for the incubator model.** Unsustainable, because they use expensive dedicated resources (professional mentors and administrators, fancy urban spaces); undesirable because they _want_ people who are not tough enough to get through the meat grinder to give up and go elsewhere. \n\n4. **Edgeryders claims that we can do sustainable patient support if we do it peer-to-peer, and if we use open source knowledge all around**. People coach each other; activities are documented and documentation is published with open licenses, so that they and go on to feed a knowledge commons. This means lower costs.\n\n5. **Reef-type live-work spaces \u2013 powered by the OpenVillage concept \u2013 also create efficiency by riding on existing excess capacity**. In The Reef, people and businesses (like, well, a patient incubator for social innovation) live in symbiosis, without competing for space because they have complementary uses for the same space. This also means lower costs.\n\n6. **All this means Edgeryders has a new proposition for the development sector.** It is a new kind of incubator offering patient peer-to-peer support to social innovation projects. It has several ingredients: the online community is the one we have developed the most. We are now adding a physical space to the stack. In the next year, we bring this new ecosystem to market.\n\nGiven all this, we are going to use a residencies program to support our extant (mostly online) activities in the MENA region, _and_ to build a prototype site of this new type of incubator, _and_ to feed into the unfolding of the larger OpenVillage vision. For this, we don't need a space in a capital city; we need a large, cheap building in an attractive location. As a prototype, we will probably not keep it going after the end of the project. But we (Edgeryders) will take what we learn there and use it to consolidate our work. Additionally, we make a long-term commitment to the region: we will stay, though not necessarily in the same place where we hold the residencies.\n\n\n## Ways to be involved\n\nWe put out several calls:\n\n1. **For project owners**. These are people with an initiative to develop. They are committed to it. When the residency is over, they will be the ones responsible to drive it forward. We could host 3-5 of these, all from the region.\n\n2. **For support specialists**. These are people with substantial skills (developers, hardware hackers, bio hackers, bizdev people), who agree to support with time and skills one project owner. They can be from anywhere in the world.\n\n3. **For the REEF MENA co-founders**. We think we can leverage the demo into a sustainable business. Looking for local partners.\n\n4. **For space co-founders**. It seems that quite a few people want to start their own spaces (co-working. co-living etc.) as a way to bring about change and make a living for themselves. So we share expertise and teach one another a way forward. \n\nSelected residents get funded travel to the space; free accommodation and food for the duration of their residency; some very small bursary.\n\n\n## The timeline\n\n### Mid-September 2017: call for applications and boost engagement\n\nIn two weeks from now, we need a complete information pack to be online. What we are doing, where and when, and how people can be part of it. This needs a firm decision on location, because the information pack needs to contain a picture of the actual building where the Sawa-OpenVillage community will have its moral center for the next year.\n\nThis announcement kicks our engagement strategy into high gear. It should drive interest to...\n\n### Late September: info workshops\n\n... the [workshops](http://openvillage.edgeryders.eu/mena) that @nadia and the team will be running in the region in the second half of September, and...\n\n### October 19-21: OpenVillage Festival in Brussels\n\n... the Brussels [Festival](http://festival.edgeryders.eu). We set up an info/co-design session on the Sawa/OpenVillage operation in Brussels. There are ways to get support for people in the region that want to come \u2013 @noemi has the details.\n\n### October 31st: Deadline for applications\n\n### November 31st: residents selected.\n\n### December 31st: party!\n\nWe start our MENA deployment with a party. In this phase, a space is already available and paid for, but no other support is provided.\n\n### January 2018: buildup \n\nThe whole Edgeryders team decamps to the new space for a month. We work from there, even those who are not directly involved in the project. Others are welcome to join depending on space, but no support is provided.\n\n### February-April: residencies.\n\nActual residencies. \n\n### May 2018 \u2013 May 2218: to be continued?\n\nIn the unMonastery \"200 years\" tradition.", "created_at": "2017-09-02 14:04:13.832720", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 00:04:39.619290", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1051, "wiki": false, "reads": 47, "score": 804.4, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3782, 3769, 3789, 3729, 2787, 4065], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25833, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 3033, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Hi @Zhanna and @Noemi,\n\nActually I have already contacted all of the mentioned candidates earlier for inviting to the event in Yerevan, and Karen was also present at some point.

Stories told by Manu (Italian entrepreneur in Bucharest), Bridget M. (climate activist UK), perhaps Henry (designer, Germany) or even Hany (Egypt, based on [this story](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-homeschooling-story-from-egypt/6657)).

More speakers need more time.\n\n## Relevant tools we have at our disposal\n### Always-on video chat meeting rooms\nThese are intended for things like running online events where you need breakout rooms, running team meetings or even for just hanging. They are only available to people with edgeryders.eu accounts. If you want to create your own you can do so by posting a request in a comment below. We will follow up with a few questions in a direct message to be sure everyone is aligned in how the room is to be used and then open a room for you. [Example here](https://now.edgeryders.eu/room/community?fbclid=IwAR1GMjc6SCd9ASrD4E8nDfA1afWvzvMCkHWZ__prp6RgS-f6psfRhF2s6U0).\n\n### Active Online Community Forums with built in sensemaking tools\nRelevant because: This enables us to easily connect with others interested in the same topics. Deepen the discussions. Build visualisations to show points of convergence with others as a foundation for potential collaborations around emergent insights.\n\n### Registration forms for events that smoothly onboard participants onto online forums\nRelevant because: we want to make it easy for people to connect and start the conversations before, and after the event. So that the webinars are part of a fruitful, action oriented process rather than something you just \"consume\". Example from previous event:  https://register.edgeryders.eu\n\n### Landing pages \nWebinar only: This is a functionality which enables you to host a webinar that has restricted access to the livechat. This is very useful for when you want to have different levels of access. For example you may want to limit access to people who participated in the preparatory conversations or participated in a previous activity. It is also useful if you want to do crowdfunding campaigns where one of the perks is to have one's questions featured during the webinar. Example here: https://live.edgeryders.eu/\n\nCommunity Dialogue: We have developed a stack of modules that enable you to set up a minisite that make it easy to present the campaign or larger set of activities  within which the Webinar/ Community Call lives. It enables you to feature discussion threads or high quality posts. Everything is easily updated through the online edgeryders platform.

I do not believe that anybody would say reading books is more important to gaming, it is more the opposite, reading books is a way to stimulate abstraction and fantasy and in this way an addition than gaming.

And it needs to differentiate the varied roles of actors in the system -- it is much too over-symplified in the 21st century to think on the basis of a dualistic economy of capitalists and workers, or workers and their vanguard. I'm not an ecologist at all, but maybe without getting bogged down in detailed correspondences we can find a way to think of an economy as being a kind of ecosystem. It's something I have been playing with, but had not previously put into writing.\n\nWhat I am supposing we mean by \"predators\" is people with strong personalities -- \"natural leaders\" is another, more complementary designation for pretty much the same people. They are leaders of a government, of a Socialist revolution, or of large companies -- only the details are changed. Their impulse is to take over, because their self-confidence propels them to believe that they have the answers. What is needed is to constrain their desire to dominate by ensuring the framework is oriented toward service. \"The one who leads is the one who serves the rest best.\" This must be baked into the system.\n\nRoles easily come to mind: those who have the personalities of workers -- do a certain amount of work a day, which fulfills the need to contribute to society -- otherwise spend time with family or rest. Many of them would become artisans -- they would find an affinity for metal or wood or code, or for making their production more efficient. Perhaps someone would listen to their ideas. There are many people are like this -- there is no blame -- such people are the bedrock of production. There are dreamers, who create art and literature, but also think about possibilities of how to organize society. There are researchers, who are oriented toward doing science, physical or social scientific research. There are entrepreneurs, who are happy to spend 80 hours a week trying to create a new product and find people who want to use it. People who want to serve others directly, as nurses or social workers or psychologists. People who don't get along with other humans but have an affinity for animals, or for plants, or for fish in the sea. They are our links to the world around us. Explorers.\n\nOne sets up an education system around finding and expanding these qualities in individuals, instead of educating industrial workers in one part, and elite leaders in another part, like the old one. Not sending people down \"tracks\", but allowing them to explore their own feelings about what they want to do. Really, dreadfully simple. Expensive, because differentiated, but digital technology should reduce the cost. Ultimately the reward in terms of increased productivity would be enormous.\n\nNaturally discrimination on the basis of the normal criteria, such as so-called \"race\" or other tribal identifications such as religion, or sexual orientation or culture, would be an insidious virus inside such a system which would have to be strenuously prevented. The more problematic kind of discrimination -- that of subtly supposing any particular kind of person to be \"better\" or \"more important\" -- would also have to be suppressed, though that would be harder.\n\nThen you have a web: not only one in which predators are caught, but also one in which the talents of all players are optimized.", "created_at": "2019-10-13 21:38:35.670930", "updated_at": "2019-10-13 21:38:35.670930", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 582, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [61215], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63641, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11469, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![Type_69_Operation_Desert_Storm%20(1)|690x398](upload://lKc1ypjM093R8OqCWTWKEins2LF.jpeg) \n\n<br>\n\nI would like to weave together into a 150-300 word article and case studies that can help each one of us \n \n1. Make sense of how to resolve the underlying tensions between acknowledging the socialecological costs of the tech industry...and findings ways to develop technological tools that help create conditions for a zero/negative carbon economy which offers accessible opportunities for everyone to build healthy, happy lives.\n\n2. Figure out how each one of us can put the skills, resources and relationships we in service of making this happen. Not in a theoretical, pie in the sky scenario - but based on the practical constraints of our  everyday lives right now.\n\n\nAs @amelia puts it, this means we need to go beyond conversations in which we discuss the merits of various solutions or technologies. Rather it requires us to include more of our personal experience, motivations and examples in our stories, thoughts, ideas and project presentations and discussions. Our views on the topic are surely interesting, but knowing what brought each of us to start thinking about it and what shaped your ideas is what will enable us to not only connect but also to discuss and research on a deeper level!\n\n**What questions/dilemmas are you yourself struggling with right now? What do you think we should be asking one another and everyone we know, peer to peer, to help you firgure out a solution?**\n\nMy own personal struggle is tied to how to live and work with others in a spirit of solidarity set against a backdrop of being an ethnic minority in Europe, a lifetime of moving around and the experience of how quickly things can fall apart due to shifts outside our direct control (read: war + health).\n\nI had a beautiful and free childhood in communities of expatriates from all over the planet who moved due to professional opportunities. All of them with tertiary education. A lot of this was spent in the middle east, more specifically the Gulf region. So a mix of people with professions that were fairly well paid, or filthy wealthy because well - the gulf. The situation was stable, very safe and free for children - school then home then playing outdoors with lots of kids and pretty much no supervision. While my own family is culturally, ethnically and religiously mixed - Our social circle was largely defined by being part of a tight knit North Sudanese community.\n\nThe Sudanese are a communitarian people with strong ties to their country and regions of origin. My dad is from a region called Al Gezira. Farmers + Communitarian + Communist. Traditionally a thorn in the side of the political leadership in the capital. I hadn't realised just how influential this strand of my heritage is until the  recent, still ongoing, revolution in the country. It's funny how these things can make you see where certain aspects of your person come from. \n\nThen  Iraq invaded Kuwait. My Dad was running a research Lab at IBM and was doing something brainy at the University. Staff were warned in advance that something was happening,  but it still came as a complete surprise. After a dramatic turn of events involving parents driving through barricades, a student of my Dad's offered their farmhouse as a refuge. \n\nFastforward through a jouney that took us through Iraq, jordan and Egypt.\n\nWe then moved to Stockholm, during what later came to be known as a decade of violent racism in Sweden. Because of the war in the Balkans an unexpectedly large number of people from former Yugoslavia sought refuge in Sweden, especially during the first years of the war. This happened at the same time as Sweden experienced worst recession in 60 years- It didn\u2019t take long for things to turn ugly. Then as as we do now,  we saw a hostile reaction to refugees and migrants. At it\u2019s worst we saw people walking around with weapons using lazer- visors to terrorise and kill those who \u201clook like immigrants\u201d.\n\nThe Swedish labour market at the time was, and still, is deeply shaped by people's social relationships. It is a small country that is notoriously difficult to really make your home in unless you have childhood friendships to rely on. But tech has always been a big place, especially when internet/digital was making it's way into the ecnonomy. I jumped on that train fairly early and that was my \"ticket in\".\n\nThere is a much longer story within which my own is situated- but you get the idea, this mix between tight tight solidarity, and an environment of extreme hostility. I am painfully aware of the importance of having financial resources to get yourself and your family out of dangerous situations. And of how quickly a seemingly hospitable social environment can turn against you and make clear that you don't really belong/Can rely on protection.\n\nOthers say that your best bet of surviving a difficult situation, e.g impending climate catastrophe, is being embedded in a web of nurturing relationships. \n\n**But how much can you rely on this web in a multicultural setting where people do not have the same strong ties to an ancient culture and land?**  \n\n**And what does this mean for how you relate to the development and use of technologies?** \n\n**How do you balance the need for profiting from a company and caring for the needs of others?** \n\nAll of this somehow ties in to these discussions we are having. But I am at a loss for how to move forward wisely over the coming years.\n\n**So this is me. Any suggestions based on your own experiences?**", "created_at": "2019-11-10 09:21:49.485923", "updated_at": "2019-11-11 15:43:24.135031", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 953, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 204.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323, 4934, 2915, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14846, "user_id": 2129, "topic_id": 6585, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>fb group Mindmap and other input</b>\n\nThe Tblpod Mindmap @Inge mentioned is this available as list \u00a0here\u00a0http://tblpod.com/guide or jpg in several of the groups listed.

That I tell you from my experience as a journalist. It is much easier than online discussion in Nepal. It was true before the disaster and today, it is more true than ever.\u00a0\n\n- People are more comfortable in GROUP DISCUSSIONS. I recommend a group of 5-6 people (preferably friends because it will be easier to manage time) with us prepared with questions revolving around the theme. The challenge here is not lack of resources (people). It is getting the time to make them talk.\u00a0\n\n- I like the SMS system. I also want to add that there is a time constraint. How about we prepare the questions we want to ask people. If we want them to \"talk\" then they do. But we'd probably be able to take 20 percent of what they tell us. People sometimes prefer a guideline. This goes into email exchanges as well. If we define objectives and come up with questions, then we can forward the emails to people and probably get more responses.\u00a0\n\n- I agree with Dipti when she says people are conscious in front of camera in Nepal. Audio is a much accessible means. Both Dipti and I are experienced as journalists so we can even note down the questions (supported by audio of course). We can have few people talk in the video but most would prefer audio (probably with a picture of the speaker?)\u00a0\n\n- Finally, I don't know how much time we have (and I hope Dipti agrees to it) but we might get the richest resource when we have in-depth discussions with the people. I want to do a few blog posts where I talk to few inspirational people working in the field.\u00a0\n\n- We can use social media more actively. How about we use the same introduction we have ready in all our personal Facebook Profiles and then invite people. I don't know how much that can help but we can try.\n\nAgain, any suggestions are welcome. Dipti and I are meeting today to discuss it further. We will keep you updated. Meanwhile, we are trying to get in more people the old way as well! :)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-19 05:04:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:35.315243", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 436, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 2566, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40294, "user_id": 4196, "topic_id": 7835, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Hey guys!\nI'm quite new here, so I only know a few of your stories. \nBut as it happens, I'm right now preparing for my master thesis, which I'd want to be about new methods of creating and communicating visions together. - I guess Storytelling will be a huge part of this. \n\nSo if there are options to apply these methods in an EdgeRyder context - workshops or civic design projects - I'd be happy to use them, to help make an impact and to have use cases for my thesis.", "created_at": "2017-12-13 13:38:35.247404", "updated_at": "2017-12-13 13:38:35.247404", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 92, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 105.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3311, 3904, 3769, 3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77924, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 12895, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Ok thanks.

To boost engagement and clicks on IOH related material, content should be made more visual i.e:\n\n* When a new project is promoted which is made by a member (new podcast platform), would be good to create a GIF material of it and use it for promotion\n* Share short audio or video snippets of founders of those projects with a text description\n* Adopting a more educational approach to the way that content is shared (bringing more value to the fans that would read this), would generate more engagement. This can be done in explanatory posts that deal with i.e. \"Why its good to use a project X that our member made instead of a commercial solution\". Here we don't need to trash talk commercial solutions, just mention in general why something is better than other accesible solutions.\n* Share more content from IOH (especially focus on green tech as the project takes shape)\n\nTwitter\n\nBest performing:\n\nTech talk: 23\nSocial media is broken: 14\nInternet and CO2: 7\n\nThese results can and should be better.

It is not your typical \u201cgreen wellness\u201d document recommending mindfulness and no plastic straws. Instead, this manual is intentionally extreme and radical, because that is the kind of response that we need in the current climate crisis and wider ecological crisis. This document is no ready-made instruction manual either, as the ideas are not yet ready for mainstream use. Instead, they are provided as inspiration for early adopters and urban living R&D labs. In our own organization, this is [what The Reef aspires to be](../../../../../../t/12066) in the future; also, we are looking for other partners for this journey.\n\n**Structure.** This document groups interventions into chapters by their primary goal or effect: for the climate, against waste, for biodiversity. Each sub-chapter treats a cluster of related interventions (\u201cwarm clothing\u201d, \u201csmall heated spaces\u201d etc.), where all these related ideas are treated in the form of a coherent text. Finally, tables and diagrams help to compare the relative impact and other properties of the interventions.\n\n**Content licence.** This is an open source document under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported licence (CC-BY 4.0), or at your option any later version.\n\n**Acknowledgements.** This manual has been created with the funding and support of [EIT Climate-KIC](https://www.climate-kic.org/), a European climate action organization. EIT Climate-KIC is supported by the European Institute of Technology (EIT), a body of the European Union.\n\n![EIT-Climate-KIC-EU-flag-transparent|690x254,75%](upload://rRCxtfLkIeCHIkDyp0JVHNeLan7.png) \n\nIn addition, this manual as an open collaboration project received precious contributions from people in EIT Climate-KIC, the Edgeryders company and community, and from the Internet at large.\n\n**How to contribute.** This manual is an open source project, and you are welcome to contribute yourself. However you obtained it, the most recent version is always [a wiki on edgeryders.eu](../../../../../../t/12097). After opening a (free) account on the edgeryders.eu platform, you can join the discussion thread below that wiki, adding your feedback, reports of problems with the document, or proposed additions. If you feel confident about your contribution, you can also directly contribute it by editing the wiki. The wiki uses Discourse flavoured Markdown for formatting, all of which is documented in our [Discourse User Manual](../../../../../../t/6463).\n\n**This is a wiki!** Because this document is an open collaboration project with multiple editors, it is never really finished, just like Wikipedia for example. Expect to find some sections in draft state, to-do markers etc., because we keep working on and extending this document for our own purposes even after the end of the funded project where this document was started.\n\n**What is not included here.** The following topics are outside the scope of this document and not treated here:\n\n-   **Well-known good practices.** There is little need for yet another document about well-established and well-known practices of ecological urban living. We only deal with the future here, with what goes beyond the status quo. This includes little-known good practices, innovations and also refutations, in cases where an established practice is not a good idea for ecological living.\n-   **Long-distance traveling.** Traveling within the city is considered part of urban living, but traveling beyond its limits is not. For long-distance traveling, we started the [Green Travel Manual](../../../../../../t/10552). And for measures to avoid business travel, see our [Distributed Collaboration Manual](../../../../../../t/11263).\n-   **Social and financial aspects. And motivation.** This document is about technology only \u2013 to derive value from it, you need to come with both motivation and money to apply that tech. It will not help you to create the right incentives for ecological behavior in a group, or to persuade investors to invest in your ecological living project. It will also not prevent you from housing a capitalist enterprise or other status quo protecting organization in your ecological building. It will just tell you (right here and now): that would be completely self-defeating. Using ecological living techniques to hide the ecology-destroying nature of the status quo is called greenwashing.\n-   **Basic construction.** There is a lot to be said about alternative cement and more sustainable construction materials. But making o with the current building stock and maintaining it properly is even more sustainable, and already a full solution for construction during the current decades of severe climate crisis (hopefully ending 2050, and then we can focus on new construction as well).\n-   **Urban infrastructure.** There is a lot that can be done for emission reduction with changes to the city\u2019s infrastructure. This document is meant for building owners and inhabitants though, so it only covers what can be changed up to the scale of buildings. For innovations in urban infrastructure, we have another document called \u201c[An Autarky System for Cities](../../../../../../t/9141)\u201d.\n-   **Rural living.** For rural living, a very different set of green living techniques is possible. So we provide a companion document for that setting: \u201c[The Future of Ecological Rural Living](../../../../../../t/7566)\u201d.\n-   **Industrial production.** Urban households simply do not provide the space for industrial production, so we can\u2019t include this part. We do however include criteria to select the most eco-beneficial industrial products where it is necessary to rely on them. Also, maintaining and repairing any artifact used inside the household and small-scale production and product modification fall into our definition of urban living.\n-   **Industrial logistics.** This is a secondary problem following from centralized industrial production, and not a problem of urban living.\n\n**Estimation of household benefits.** We try (and sometimes fail) to put numbers on everything proposed in this document, so you can choose solutions based on evidence and not simply comfort or instinct. It is the ecological equivalent of [effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism): using data and evidence to find the most effective ways of not harming our natural environment.\n\nThe benefits of everything included here is numerically estimated relative to a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d scenario of a typical household (1) in the same climate zone (2) in a so-called \u201chighly developed\u201d region, because these are the households with the worst ecological impacts. Solutions are then ranked by the benefits for a household in the same climate zone \u2013 because this is a household manual, and households should be able to always choose the next suitable solutions from the top of the list. Note that solutions are partially overlapping, so the sum of benefits can be higher than 100%; for example, a transition to communal living may involve some of the same changes as a transition to smaller heated spaces or collective purchasing.\n\n**Global benefits.** In addition, solutions are grouped together based on the estimated benefits when applied globally, into steps of reducing 50% of the remaining ecological impacts of human living activities.\n\n## <span id=\"anchor-2\"></span>Basic principles and techniques\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-3\"></span>Designing for mainstream adoption\n\nTo be relevant, there is no way around mainstream adoption of any future solutions for ecological urban living. The best way to design for mainstream adoption is to encapsulate complexity into either consumer products or commercial service offerings. In a way, in most European countries every consumer uses even nuclear power stations \u2013 mediated through the utility company. So basically every solution can be packaged or organized in a way that allows mainstream adoption. For most ideas discussed further below, this will be either a consumer product or a neighborhood-scale service offering.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-4\"></span>Construction vs. usage\n\n-   **Consumption is 80% of the problem, construction 20%.** The energy costs of constructing a house is 20% of its total lifetime energy costs, while the energy cost during its lifetime of usage is 80%. When the building is well maintained and lives long, that ratio is skewed even more towards usage. This is why this document does not put much emphasis on construction but a lot on the activities of living, because that is where the greenhouse gas emissions etc. of urban living happen.\n-   **Innovation is hard. To make living greener, invest in human expertise instead.** Innovation of products and materials often does not work at the start, and requires a lot of experimentation before it is ready for general use.\n\n    For a small-scale setup like a communal living space, a more appropriate way to innovate green living could be \u201cprocess innovation\u201d for building maintenance. Basically, build up a system so that the community can maintain its own space: train different members as plumbers, electricians etc. and also get the relevant tools so that all problems can be fixed with little effort, extending the building\u2019s utility, lifetime, and eco-friendliness. Investing in human expertise cannot go wrong, while investing in new materials and technologies may go wrong.\n\n    A simple example: a concrete wall made from some new composite is not self-maintainable and may thus only last 50 years. There is no real need for such a wall though, as brick walls have been around for hundreds of years and we know how to maintain them for that amount of time. Innovation is also important, but one of the greatest values of a building is that we can keep it alive, and that is an important aspect of buildings being \u201cgreen\u201d.\n\n-   **The impact of human care on buildings.** Buildings don\u2019t last \u201c100 years\u201d like that, it can be 30 years or 300 years depending on the quality of their maintenance. So the cost of providing a function for a certain time is more determined by the care afterwards than by the initial investment. For example, Renzo Piano will rebuild the bridge that recently collapsed in Italy, with a version in steel that \u201cwill last 1000 years\u201d, as he says. He did not mention with what maintenance. And bad maintenance was the main reason why the first bridge collapsed. So whatever you build, don\u2019t care only for materials and high-tech, also care to put money into operation and maintenance. Because it is a new approach, this is innovative for the current time. Modern \u201csensor and IoT equipped\u201d buildings can be a nightmare to maintain.\n-   **The cost of maintenance, and how to deal with them.** Nothing is re-used for what it because that is a lot of manual work. And manual work is not time efficient, and we have not enough money in Europe to pay people for much of their time anymore. Just enough to pay them for operating machines \u2013 everything else is manufactured by machines or in China. The same limitations apply to unique construction of houses \u2013 instead, all new houses now look very similar, and the look results from the optimization to be built with machines, not with manual work. Again, the same limitations apply to building maintenance: in earlier centuries, a building was always maintained so it could live \u201cforever\u201d. Now, buildings have an expiry date and are then destroyed and replaced, because maintenance is \u201ctoo expensive\u201d manual work that cannot be automated away.\n\n    In communal living, there is no general solution to that, but at least a partial one. Namely, comparing the cost of worktime and machine work is just a financial comparison that does not capture all the value. By working less outside of the community and more inside, people will have fun making their own things \u201cinefficiently\u201d, and in total may prefer that to working for money and buying industrially made items. That\u2019s even more applicable when starting to make things not from scratch but from the waste of the surrounding society, such as all the stuff one can take out of buildings before they are being destroyed.\n\n-   **Bring careful observation back to modern architecture!** The traditional architecture in different areas is very different, also within Europe. It developed over hundreds of years of incremental development. In the last 50 years, that changed a lot, so now most new houses all around Europe are built very similarly. Is that bad, and should we rather just trust the traditional, accumulated knowledge?\n\n    Indeed, architecture always changes, and traditional knowledge gets lost. We don\u2019t understand a lot of building features of traditional architecture and material use. It\u2019s ok that processes change, the problem with the new processes is that they are not developed from careful observation of the objects and environment. For example, houses are optimized for efficient construction and not to last (because \u201ccheap materials, expensive labor for construction and maintenance\u201d). Similarly, commercial buildings like banks are remodeled every 7 years.\n\n    New ways of ecological building can be informed from this process of \u201ccareful observation\u201d of the past. That will allow to build with cheaper and more environmentally friendly materials in a way that achieves the same or better effects as with today\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d materials. In addition, careful observation can inform how maintenance can extend the lifetime of modern buildings to a multiple of their planned lifetime.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-5\"></span>How to approach converting a building\n\n-   **Starting from an old office building.** The advantage here is that partition walls etc. can be easily removed and reconfigured.\n-   **Mobile conversion kit for temporary spaces.** That\u2019s a different approach to having an \u201cown\u201d space, and much simpler to realize: have a container with a kit to transform any abandoned building into a comfortable space within 7 days for 1-3 years of temporary use, with 2 days at the end to take all of that equipment out again. If this is about buildings that will be destroyed anyway, it will even be ok to remove walls and change the structure of the building when moving in. Utilizing abandoned buildings is also environmentally friendly because the continued maintenance extends the lifetime of these buildings.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-6\"></span>How to approach architectural innovation\n\n-   **Exploring a proposal before it\u2019s built.** Architects to models a lot (actual physical models, not just 3D models). Others do a lot of discussions with potential users, to explore how they react to their design ideas.\n-   **Exploring construction innovations on a small scale.** For construction innovations aimed at large-scale application, architecture studios (like that of [Renzo Piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renzo_Piano)) combine architecture with research. That however cannot really be pulled off for a single community building. There are also software packages for thermal modeling, light modeling etc. \u2013 these are useful for spatial innovation, not for material innovation. Because non-standard materials are hard to model with these software packages. It may be possible (with the PEB thermal modeling software package for example) but even for professionals, using that software is hard and expensive. Ideally there would be open source software packages that encapsulated the complexity and allows non-professionals to take over design and modeling tasks formerly reserved for professionals. However, that seems not to exist (yet).\n\n    A more appropriate technique for such a setup is to create a setting (both physical and by social organization) that is welcoming the construction innovations. This can include, for example: a building that is simple to re-configure; piping and wiring that allow to install new innovative machines and devices wherever people want; a large on-site workshop that allows to adapt the building and its equipment quickly.\n\n-   **On new facade materials (like PV panels).** There is a house in Australia using PV panels as roof covering, somewhat tilted so that light can still get through to the inside. In architecture, there are multiple uses of wall finishing / cladding: weather protection, and allowing the building to breathe (humidity transfer to the outside to prevent humidity buildup, mould, dampness indoors etc.). Depending on weather condition, the outer layer is of different permeability, impacting how the building is breathing. In some parts of Portugal, tiles are used for example.\n\n    So to start hacking together a new cladding system (such as from PV panels), a good tip is to start with experimentation. Nothing too big, nothing too drastic at the start. \u201cPlay with it.\u201d Just to see how the material behaves, how it can be attached etc.. It will be difficult to pull off such a hack, as the material was not designed for such a use, so may perform worse for it than industrial cladding systems. Or at least it will probably not perform better. For PV panels, a purely ornamental use (plus power generation of course) of PV panels, or a use as a sight protection / separation wall on a fence or similar, could be the first experiments, as not so much can go wrong.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-7\"></span>Dealing with legacy laws and regulations\n\n**Routing around regulations.** If you have no close neighbors, it is much simpler to ignore regulation because there is nobody who will complain to the authorities. Also, try to break only rules for the inside, not in relation to the outside environment. Then, the problem only arises when you want to sell the building \u2013 then an architect will have to check what has to be changed for that to be possible. So that will be the time to undo ones hacks and changes \u2013 and when keeping the house, it will never be a problem.\n\n**Combining houses in the city.** Buying adjacent houses and making them into a single house by knocking down walls is prohibited in Brussels. But you could just do it, and put up the walls again when moving out :slight\\_smile:\n\n**Dealing with fire safety.** In cities, public and communal spaces are tightly supervised by the fire brigade. They may mandate the type and material of walls, fire protection doors etc. to isolate buildings against each other so that there is a safety window for people in one part if another part catches on fire. For example, staircases in large buildings will have to be isolated from a kitchen space with a fire safety door.\n\n**Certification issues with material re-use.** Any certified component of a building is not legal to be put to use again in a new building. The certification only applied when that equipment was installed the first time, but now the standards might be different and not cover these items anymore for getting a new building certified. For example, emergency lamps. All these items are now considered waste. It especially also applied to electronics components.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-8\"></span>Take it to the neighborhood\n\nBy integrating social projects such as clothing exchange events and rescued food distribution, a communal household or other group can make the living in the whole local area more green, not just its own. It would be interesting to do the numbers for that, and it may turn out to be the most efficient way of emission reduction. From @Bernardo\u2019s experience, a best practice to do these social service projects is to do those that also profit yourself, because then it\u2019s not a net drain on the organizer: if you have kids, organize kids clothes exchange events; if you cycle, organize a cycle repair workshop; if you like dancing or working out, offer dance classes or open a gym in the communal space.\n\nThese can also be semi-commercial activities and still be a net benefit for the neighborhood. It provides a public good because of \u201czero marginal cost\u201d: scaling the service up to more people beyond ones own and direct community\u2019s needs does not really cost more, so can be provided as a service at a low price or even for free.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-9\"></span>Household consumption accounting\n\nThe lifetime of a well-maintained building can be considered to approach infinity \u2013 the building is never used up in its entirety. Then, all ecological impacts of a household happen connected to the material and energy flows into and out of the house. Tracking these flows is quite a realistic task using energy meters, water meters, scales and barcode scanners. With barcode scanners, it is simple to record what purchased packaged items enter the house. With that setup in place, household level GHG accounting and optimization is also realistic.\n\nNote that, to keep the accounting low-overhead, the unit of accounting is the household not the person. Nothing done in other households (living in a hotel, eating out etc.) is taken into account, as that is thought to belong to the accounting of other households. The disadvantage is of course that households are very different so that comparing results with other households is not simple \u2013 however, a rough estimate of (more comparable) per-capita greenhouse gas emissions can be made by adjusting for person days in the household and including long-distance traveling. And the main purpose is anyway to make progress over time in this one household, not to compare with others.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-10\"></span>It\u2019s all about resource efficiency\n\nIn spite of all ecological zeal, we\u2019ll never propose that any human being has to leave Earth earlier than it will happen naturally to them. We\u2019ll also not question the ultimate (non-material) life goals of anyone, whether they want an interesting, happy, beautiful or meaningful life. With these constraints, there are only two things we can do to save our ecosystems. First: not making so many new people. Second: finding the most resource efficient way to have the life you are looking for.\n\nSo if you are looking for happiness in life, it is not enough to achieve this, but to achieve it with as little resource consumption as you possibly can. In other words, frugality is the supreme value for this time of ecological crisis. In current Western societies however, people do not have this value; frugality is demanded from technology only, not from people. And even where government demands frugality from technology by setting resource efficiency standards, it is all too easy for companies to circumvent this by planned obsolescence, pseudo-innovations etc.. Governments are also not serious about frugality, because if it would indeed lower the absolute amount of resource consumption, then it would be hard to impossible to still grow the economy \u2013 trading resources to consumers for \u201cconsumption\u201d is the major way how GDP is made, after all.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-11\"></span>Taking back tasks to the private space\n\nModern Western society since the 1950s is a history of the socializing of tasks that were earlier taken on by the extended family, such as childcare, care for the sick, care for the elderly and so on. And the public system for doing these is very inefficient: not only does it require to build, maintain and heat houses in addition to the existing homes of individuals, the public system is also overly cautious to avoid claims of damage compensation and similar issues and thus needs many more resources for the same task.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-12\"></span>The Internet enables efficiency like nothing before\n\nRight now, much of the Internet is a commercially dominated space for advertising. But technologically, it is the most efficiency-enhancing technology that humanity has ever had: it can provide a fully automated, society-wide and truly global resource coordination system. The notion of \u201cfully automated luxury communism\u201d is not far. Very little of that potential has been used so far.\n\n## <span id=\"anchor-13\"></span>Lifestyle and living\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-14\"></span>Ecologically responsible childcare\n\n**Communal childcare is ecological.** When homes have safe spaces for children, community members can start to care for groups of children. That relieves other community members to do other work and also is much more efficient than the public kindergarden system, both in terms of costs and ecologically, because the kindergarden building does not have to be built, heated and maintained, and also no transport of children to and from that building is necessary.\n\n**Spaces for efficient supervision of small children.** Childcare should be integrated with the normal living area as much as possible to require as little as possible direct adult supervision \u2013 because that is efficient. For small children for example, a good choice is to provide the building with a large inner courtyard with child-safe toys, plants etc..\n\n**Unsupervised child play.** In a communal space that is somehow enclosed (not like a gated community, but a bit \u2026), unsupervised play is simple, even in today\u2019s age and in cities. Children can become quite self-sufficient \u2013 @alberto mentioned how in such a neighborhood in Milano, the children made all the adults keep their doors unlocked so the kids could go in and out of the houses of their friends to get water, go to the toilet, meet their friends etc.. It made the environment more social for everyone, and is more efficient regarding adult attention. It\u2019s not directly \u201cgreen\u201d, but frees up precious time for other activities, including for those that take more time but less other resources and are thus part of \u201cgreen living\u201d. It also lowers the need to move children around in a car between activities.\n\n**Provision for children activities at home.** \u201cDo you really need your children be driven to karate and back? Make them a football place in the courtyard instead.\u201d And similar approaches. It uses less energy for transport, and it frees up adult time for other aspects of a greener lifestyle, which is often more time-consuming.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-15\"></span>GHG offsetting\n\nIt may turn out that emission offsetting by donating to the various schemes created for this purpose is, for the time being, the most effective intervention for the climate that affluent urban residents can make. This will change once the low-hanging fruits of carbon offsetting are gone and demand for it rises, at which point the price (EUR / t CO2e) will rise and some local solutions to avoid emissions become more cost effective. But for the time being, earning more money and donating it for emission reduction could be best for everyone who *can* earn more money.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-16\"></span>Work / home integration\n\nOffices are a very inefficient use of space: they are empty 16 or 24 hours a day, and still consume resources and represent embodied energy and emissions. In addition, workers have to travel there and back to their homes. Rather have your office in your home, for example a super-easy-to-clean room that is an office during the day and a party room in the evening. To be easy to clean, dangling furniture mounted to the ceiling could be a new approach.\n\nSee the [Distributed Collaboration Manual](../../../../../../t/11263) for detailed tips on how to work with your colleagues when you work remotely from your home.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-17\"></span>Avoiding material consumption\n\nA household\u2019s energy consumption can be switched to be green fast and easily: just switch to a provider of renewable electricity, ditch the car, and use heat pumps for space heating. This is very different for all material consumption, as the industrial processes happened in the past, far away and in a complex network of suppliers, making it impossible to guarantee that any physical product was produced \u201csustainably\u201d.\n\nFor this reason, material consumption should be avoided as radically as possible. Another reason is resource depletion, because in any not-fully-circular economy, material consumption permanently increases resource entropy, making resources permanently unavailable for future generations.\n\nThe ways to avoid material consumption are nicely summed up in the 4R principle (\u201cReduce, Reuse, Recycle and Recover\u201d), however it needs some unpacking. For example, it entails the following changes, some obvious and some not:\n\n-   **Plastic-free shopping.** Have a (communally researched) list of local purchase options etc. for no-plastic-packaging food etc.. Share your grocery shopping \u2013 that is needed to be able to get items plastic free, as plastic-free shops might be further away, or sell in larger quantities.\n-   **Fashion is a psychological issue.** Fashionable and new / clean looks is not a criterion to decide if a resource (clothing, car, furniture) is still good to use or should be discarded.\n-   **Sharing.** Sharing resources is a way to reduce their number, such as tool sharing in a neighborhood tool library.\n-   **Caring for stuff.** Good operation, protection and maintenance is a way to reduce the need for material products, because they will break less often and will be sufficient even when not performing like a newest-generation product.\n-   **Protecting mobile electronics.** Mobile tech life extenders: many notebooks and mobile phones break because they are mishandled or accidentally dropped. With proper protection and efficient aftermarket software like Linus for notebooks and LineageOS for mobile phones, they can live for more than 10 years. Many waterproof and shock-protecting cases are available, and it makes a lot of sense to get one of the toughest ones possible, esp. for people with a history of dropping or losing things.\n-   **Buying used.** Buying used items reduces the demand for new items.\n-   **Paper-free living.** There is very little to no use for paper in modern society, but it will need a deliberate effort to stop junk mail deliveries, magazines, bank statements and cardboard boxes from coming to the house. Cardboard boxes from online shopping are probably 80% of the problem. Technically, stackable or foldable plastic boxes (with cardboard layers on the outside due to the regulations of parcel delivery operators) are a feasible solution, but so far only when shipping parcels among friends and relatives as individuals won\u2019t be able to persuade online shops to use them.\n-   **Electronic alternatives.** Sometimes, you can replace material consumption with energy consumption. For example, downloading a film instead of buying a DVD. Or downloading an e-book instead of purchasing, transporting and storing a book.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-18\"></span>Compostable trash\n\nNot all material consumption can be avoided \u2013 for example, some food items will always need a way to package them, and if that food is not produced in the local area than the packaging will probably be single-use. Similarly, parcels will arrive as cardboard boxes for quite some time.\n\nHowever, trash that is compostable is not much of a problem because it becomes soil again, a valuable resource, esp. in organic agriculture. Composting is in fact carbon-negative because it sequesters carbon into the soil, while biomass burning is at best carbon neutral. (Biomass charring with partial combustion is another matter though, as that can also be carbon negative through biochar as a soil amendment.) Transporting the soil that cannot be used in the backyard garden to agricultural land is still a problem, but not as much as the organic trash it is made from because it lost mass and volume by composting.\n\nThis is an argument for a proper in-house composting facility, ideally combined with heat recovery (see section \u201cHeating with compost\u201d). And then, for maximizing the proportion of matter that enters the house and can be composted. This includes paper, cardboard, kitchen scraps, wood scraps from furniture, organic packaging material like leaves, papercrete etc.. Even human feces, see section \u201ccomposting toilet\u201d. The long-term goal would be that &gt;99% of all material entering the house is compostable, even including the insulation material of the house, wall building material like papercrete etc.. When applied to a whole city, this solves at least 60% of the whole \u201creverse logistics\u201d for trash collection and management.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-19\"></span>Neighborhood services\n\nNeighborhood services are a potential multiplier of ecological living practices. A communal living space has enough people to staff these kinds of offerings, and when selected well they can make both practical and economic sense for the communal house, even provide a business. Some example ideas are collected below:\n\n-   **Distributing rescued food.** This can for example be done as parts of regular events where the whole neighborhood is invited and where food is available on a donation basis. A communal household is still a private space, so many of the legal rules applicable to commercial handling of food will not apply here, which makes this a low-overhead, pragmatic way of rescuing food. For details, see section \u201cAgainst food waste\u201d.\n-   **Things lending service.** To reduce the number of tools and other things a household needs to own, a neighborhood-scale or even city-wide \"things logistics\" service is a great, unexplored opportunity. It can be provided by a communal household that has a lot of storage space available, and at least one delivery person and one storage worker.\n\n    Technically, there would be an open source application for searching tools and parts in the storage and ordering them within a certain time window, either for delivery or for pickup. See our [analysis of suitable open source software](https://edgeryders.eu/t/6629). In addition to lending, other things (esp. parts from product disassembly) would be available for purchase via a regular webshop software.\n\n    Delivery would ideally be possible 24 hours a day, just more expensive at odd hours. A software would dynamically organize the driver's travel route based on the pickup and delivery jobs. For delivery, a cargo e-bicycle would be employed, as that is both fast and ecologically responsible. Since most items will not be packaged for transportation (they are all used anyway!), a cargo bicycle can transport a lot of items in a small volume, probably 300% as space efficient as the storage space of a parcel service van, and even more when also considering the dead space consumed by the van itself.\n\n    Items that can be included in such a lending system are for example:\n\n    -   general household items, kitchen utensils and workshop tools\n    -   household items for parties\n    -   spare furniture for parties and hosting, optimized for transport by the cargo bicycle\n    -   special-purpose furniture such as outdoor tables and chairs\n    -   rescued food (see above)\n    -   salvaged items (see below under \u201csalvage service\u201d)\n\n-   **Salvage service.** One of the worst cases of resource wastage is trashing items that are still good to use because they are no longer needed, would consume scarce storage space and there seems to be no economically worthwhile or at least time-efficient way to transfer them to somebody who has a use for these items. As the cost of physical consumer products has been decreasing a lot for several decades now, this is a growing problem. It is of course connected to values of consumers, but these are hard and slow to change. Instead, what will also solve this issue is providing a fast and comfortable opportunity to get rid of such items, ideally even receiving some form of compensation. This is what a neighborhood-scale or city-scale \u201csalvage service\u201d would provide: getting rid of an item is as simple as dropping it before the front door and taking a photo of it with the salvage service\u2019s app. That orders a pickup by somebody with a cargo e-bicycle. After transport, the item\u2019s value will be estimated and that will be credited to the original owner\u2019s account. With that balance, people can then use other services such as the \u201cthings lending service\u201d (see above). Because transport within a neighborhood is fast and efficient, in principle any item that has a remaining use value can be salvaged via this service, including but not limited to:\n\n    -   any re-usable items that somebody wants to get rid of, from flower pots to clothing\n    -   re-purposable items, from cardboard boxes to beverage cartons and polystyrene foam\n    -   broken tech items, for repair or disassembly into re-usable parts\n    -   recyclable items, for example organic trash for composting\n\n-   **Local business database.** Should include all shops / businesses in the city and the surrounding villages, and also all the products they have, as long as they are interesting for potential purchasing. Businesses further away would also be included if they sell something that is rare / precious enough to be purchased from further afield.\n\n    By providing others access to this information online, it basically creates a local online shopping platform.\n\n    The commune would of course prefer to buy local products in order to create and support the local economy. And that is how it would use this business database: instead of purchasing something from a big city or from abroad, commune members would first evaluate if they can get alternative products from the local area. This will be true for many agricultural items, spices, herbs etc., and also for furniture, basketry work, blacksmith work etc..\n\n-   **Map with points of interest.** This should esp. be integrated with the local business database, but will also have other POIs besides that. See: \u201c[Creating a \u2018Points of Interest\u2019 map with open source tools](https://edgeryders.eu/t/9067)\u201d.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-20\"></span>Workshop, parts and a handyperson\n\nA building with 15 or more inhabitants that intends to emphasize ecological living can afford to employ one handyperson for building management, usage optimization, repairs and custom manufacturing.\n\nThat person will come with a complementary skillset of broad handicrafts and tech knowledge, a workshop and parts store that together enable a multitude of ecological living techniques that are not possible in smaller households:\n\n-   When there is a person who is paid to monitor and optimize a building\u2019s energy and resource efficiency, the incentives stack up correctly for this task to be done. That alone might already pay that person\u2019s full-time salary. In normal households it\u2019s the opposite: inhabitants are careless with resources because that allows them to have more time or energy to earn the money to pay for that carelessness \u201cand some more\u201d.\n-   Inhabitants can drop off household appliances and electronic devices to be repaired, or even better do the repairs together with the handyperson. As there will be a store for all kinds of parts and tools to adapt parts and even manufacture custom parts, repair and maintenance jobs become much cheaper. For example, with 10 broken bicycles you can keep your own bicycle running for free, forever.\n-   Furniture can be repaired and even custom built from parts of old furniture, trashed furniture, homegrown bamboo etc. and other material found in an extensive \u201cparts library\u201d near the workshop. There is no need to ever buy new furniture.\n-   Inhabitants can design small helpful devices together with the handyperson, and manufacture them with in-house tools incl. a 3D printer. These devices will be very specific for the local context and can enable idiosyncratic energy savings and resource efficiencies that are impossible with purchased products.\n-   Inhabitants have a patient mentor to learn new tech skills themselves incl. bicycle maintenance, computer repairs an other useful skills for their personal future. This can be extended into neighborhood-scale handicrafts events and courses, which over time will enable a lot of people to provide items from home-based repair, remanufacturing and production, rather than from purchasing anything new.\n-   Inhabitants are welcome to drop off any unused item in the parts library and tell what should be done with it (lending, gift etc.). The handyperson will catalogue and sort it in accordingly, and somebody else from the household or neighborhood will use it again at the next opportunity. This makes reuse so comfortable that people will actually do it, esp. since it provides the immediate benefit of physically getting rid of \u201cuseless stuff\u201d that will then reside in the parts library.\n-   The handyperson will collect certain types of wastes from the neighborhood and city and can do hacks and remanufacturing with them that are impossible in industry because they cannot be automated or because of safety concerns for consumer products. Examples include: harvesting solar cells from broken photovoltaics modules and building new modules from them; harvesting lithium-ion cells from broken accumulators and creating \u201cfree\u201d battery storage for the house from these.\n\nIf the household cannot afford paying a normal wage for this as a job, then the job could also be the equivalent of a live-in nanny job for a handicraftsperson: instead of caring for people, that person cares for things, in exchange for a place to stay, food, health insurance and a moderate amount of money. That person might come from abroad, just as live-in nannies often do.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-21\"></span>Automated building control\n\nIt seems that a lot (!) of energy efficiency and resource efficiency can be gained when controlling indoor temperature, humidity and electricity consumption with an integrated electronic system, running open source software that can be easily adjusted by the building inhabitants and that is intelligent enough to optimize internally for how to achieve its goals. Example functions would include:\n\n-   Deciding when it is better to purge excess humidity by heating and ventilation in intervals, and when it is better to use chemical absorbent that can be regenerated with heat in the summer again.\n\nThere is also value in having a peer-to-peer relationship between this technological system and the inhabitants, collaborating to achieve high targets of resource efficiency. This is different from the usual scenario where humans treat \u201ctheir\u201d technology as a slave. For example:\n\n-   The house control system might realize that it would have to start burning heating fuel soon as the heat buffers run low, and in turn might ask humans to use prepared room separation measures to close off some spaces as unheated space during the passing of a cold front.\n-   The house control system might realize that room temperature in a certain room is abnormally high, and send a human to investigate.\n\n## <span id=\"anchor-22\"></span>Food\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-23\"></span>Saving energy in the kitchen\n\nToday, the kitchen is the only remaining locus of production in an urban household. That\u2019s why, apart from building heating and hot water generation, this is the place where most resource efficiency is lost and where most can be gained again. Below is a collection of various energy-saving ideas for the near future.\n\n**A more efficient water kettle.** Current electric water kettles have a minimum setting for the amount of boiling water that they can produce; since often only one cup is needed, avoiding that minimum setting and providing a clear indicator of water amount to boil can reduce the energy needs by about 40%. Some more energy can be saved by insulating the water kettle. And then some more by a target temperature setting \u2013 some tea water is supposed to be about 80 \u00b0C for example, and heating it just to let it sit to cool a bit is a waste of energy. Also, current electric water kettles currently use resistive electric heating. That is close to 100% efficient and sustainable as long as the electricity is sustainably sourced. However the grid is far from 100% sustainable electricity, which means that everything that lowers electricity consumption helps to bring it there. So instead of resistive heating, the water kettle could use heat pumps, which are up to 350% efficient currently. One design might use a heat pump to heat up to 80 \u00b0C (which is within range of current heat pump hot water generation) and then then resistive heating to heat it the last 20 \u00b0C to boiling. An alternative design might be to just connect the water kettle to the hot water piping with very short piping to the house\u2019s central heat pump water heater, and then to use resistive heating again for the remaining 20 \u00b0C.\n\n**Other interventions.** A list of ideas:\n\n-   putting lids on pots ([predicted](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/128720/6923-how-much-energy-could-be-saved-by-making-small-cha.pdf#page=20) to save 120 kWh/a per household, see no. 22 in that document)\n-   pressure cookers and humidity\n-   insulated pots and lids: the insulation would be vacuum insulated stainless steel vessels, as known from cans and cups for hot beverages. For electric cookstoves, the pot walls and the lid would be insulated. For gas cookstoves, the outside of the pot skirt and the lid would be insulated.\n-   energy savings of communal cooking vs. cooking for 1-2 people\n-   energy saving recipes, incl. cold meals\n-   slow cooker as a kitchen appliance\n-   cooking with biogas and hydrogen\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-24\"></span>Ecological diet\n\nHere are measures for an ecologically sustainable diet \u2013 both the well-known obvious steps and a innovative ideas that will have to be researched more:\n\n-   **Low-carbon diet.** For the basics of how to change the composition of meals (not their mode of preparation) in order to be climate friendly, and what effect size this has, see: [Low-carbon diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_diet).\n-   **Reducing meat consumption.** \"Meat consumption needs to be reduced by up to 90% according to a 2018 study published in Nature.\" ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconsumption#Footprint))\n-   **Better chewing.** It would be interesting to calculate the climate benefits of this, due to lower food use and lower greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.\n-   **Hypocaloric diet.** A hypocaloric diet (1-0 diet, intermittent fasting etc.) is healthy, and it saves a net amount of food, and thus the emissions of producing that food.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-25\"></span>Against food waste\n\n**Food waste and GHG emissions.** \u201cThe food we waste is responsible for roughly 8 percent of global \\[GHG\\] emissions.\u201d ([source](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/food/reduced-food-waste)). Some more details: \u201cThe UN Food and Agriculture Organization collected data and found that by the time food reaches the consumer, 9% (160 million tons) goes uneaten and 10% is lost to overconsumption - meaning consumers ate more than the calorie intake requirement. Other aspects of losses surrounding dry matter came at each stage in the food system, the highest amount being from livestock production at 43.9%, transportation accounted for 18% and consumer waste accounting for 12.2% loss.\u201d ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconsumption#Effects))\n\n**Avoiding food waste is a communal activity.** That\u2019s a major aspect of greener living that is possible in community, and less possible in small households. Because with more people, larger amounts of rescued food can be utilized, with a large commercial kitchen food can also be preserved easily etc.. On top, rescued food can be shared in the neighborhood, which makes urban living greener even for *others*.\n\nFood preservation workshop:\n\n-   solar dehydrator\n-   canning and pressure canning equipment\n-   large collection of canning glasses\n-   fermenting equipment\n\n**Rescuing food is the best way to make an urban household carbon negative.** Due to limited space and tools, urban households have not that many options to become carbon neutral or carbon negative. However, by rescuing more food than a household needs for own consumption and distributing that in the neighborhood, a household can easily become carbon negative because this activity lowers demand for food and thus avoids the emissions of producing more food. The same applies to other neighborhood services of resource re-use and recycling, but rescuing food is the most obvious.\n\n## <span id=\"anchor-26\"></span>Space\n\nThis is about the basic space utilization of a building, and the materials and technology to construct the shell of the building incl. its inner partitioning. Everything else that will be added to the building afterwards (for example insulation) is treated in the other sections.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-27\"></span>Compact living\n\nCompact living technology and innovations allow to shrink individual rooms without a loss of comfort or function. So evaluating this comes before deciding on the room layout of a building, because it will turn out that inhabitants will be comfortable with much smaller rooms, allowing to fit more people into the same building. That in turn saves emissions from space heating and embodied energy.\n\n**Space-Saving Furniture.** This is about \u201ctiny house furniture innovations\u201d so that 20 people can live in a house meant for 10. As a side effect, such furniture can also be used to solve the (urban) housing crisis that young people experience in cities.\n\n**Compact storage.** Storage is a major aspect of space utilization in households. So by storing only what is needed (\"minimalism\") and storing everything in a very compact manner, the same space can suffice for more people without loss of comfort. That translates into emission savings for heating, embodied emissions etc.. A few ideas for this:\n\n-   Create a storage system with stackable 60\u00d740 cm [Euro ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_container)[containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_container) and use it in the whole building. Each box gets a unique number, and each storage location gets a name. Storage locations can be created in all kinds of odd spaces, including inclined areas under the roof and under stairs. Up to five boxes can be stored in a deep comaprtment in one line, to be extracted with a hook on a stick when needed. Use a database to record the contents and positions of boxes.\n-   Store clothing sorted by type in plastic bags, and the plastic bags in boxes. Do not fold or even iron clothes.\n-   Utilize all kind of odd spaces, such as under beds, on top of wardrobes etc.. Wardrobes should reach up to the ceiling and come with an attached ladder to reach to the higher compartments.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-28\"></span>Communal living\n\nThe basic room layout and partitioning of a building determines most of its space use efficiency. In communal living setups, emissions from heating and embodied energy decrease linearly with an increasing number of people in the same space, so ecological communal living is about maximizing the number of people in the same space \u2013 within practical limits.\n\n**Avoiding apartments.** If everyone has an own apartment and on top the communal spaces (party kitchen, courtyard, swimming pool etc.), it becomes more expensive per person, less space efficient and less resource efficient than the current standard family home or apartment. It can work well in social terms, though. But there seems to be a middle ground where apartments can be avoided: providing individual rooms with private bathrooms each, while all other spaces would be shared. Student housing in the UK and youth hostels are done similarly.\n\n**Floors as sub-structuring.** In the Cent-vingt-trois communal living project in Brussels, floors emerged as a natural way to structure the space. Each floor had a certain dedication / specialty, for example children, receiving guests, or punk / anarchist aesthetics. The higher up the floor, the fewer random visitors it would get as there were no stairs \u2013 effectively allowing people to choose their level of privacy. People could move between floors, and that was the mechanism how the personalities of floors naturally emerged in the first place. This mechanism allowed people to live with people they like, and avoid people they don\u2019t like \u2013 which always happens, and is a larger problem in smaller communities where there is less space.\n\n**The Modern Dorm.** It makes no sense to build, heat and clean complete rooms just for sleeping 8 hours a day. Instead, a different style of dorms could be great. Each person or couple would get their own \u201cpod\u201d, with a curtain etc.. There would be mixed dorms for singles and perhaps even dorms for couples. Dorms would not be very large, but fit 6 people into a room that would usually sleep 2. This way, people can cluster in groups that like each other and are compatible (regarding snoring etc.). In exchange, dorm sleepers get access to a luxurious room that they can book by the hour without costs (for making love, when being sick etc.). Dorms would use pods in two layers and sound and light sucking material and shapes everywhere (against snoring etc.). Both the dorms and the pods themselves would also be heavily insulated so that ideally, dorms will heat themselves from the body heat of people inside.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-29\"></span>Flexible spaces\n\nCurrent houses (and the furniture available for them) are dominated by single-purpose rooms. Since inhabitants are only in one place at a time, this means that they move between different spaces and that all their spaces except one are unused at every point of time. Instead, a much more space-efficient approach is a single space that adapts to all uses just-in-time. That is not a comfortable solution with current technology as it would require too many conversions in a single day. However, a middle ground is achievable. Some ideas are provided below:\n\n-   **Office-and-party space.** An office and co-working space during the day that can be quickly converted into a party space at night. The coworking space would include good office equipment (incl. printers, a film plotter etc.). Also, a self-service coffee machine and coffee would be provided. Then, by flipping some furniture around, the space will transform into a multi-use space for parties, yoga sessions and the like.\n-   **Personal shelves, not personal rooms.** A mobile personal shelf can be used as the replacement of the current standard idea of an \u201cown room\u201d, which is totally a waste of space. Here, people don\u2019t get own rooms in a communal living space, but own shelves. The shelves would have wheels and look like sack barrows with boxes on them, so they can be moved around in the house easily, including up and down stairs. This way, people can move between rooms in a few minutes, or store their shelf when leaving the house for a few days. Together, that enables a full utilization of the available space.\n\n    In addition to the rolling shelf, there would be a communal storage room for other items, where everyone would have one or more lockable shelf compartments. They would be able to keep that as long-term storage even while not living in the house for a time. Even the mobile personal shelf itself can be locked in there.\n\n-   **Mobile spare beds.** Rooms typically have enough space to sleep more people when there is a need, but the limiting factor is usually the availability of beds. Instead, in a communal living setup there could be a storage of 10-20 mobile spare beds, using a system that allows compact folding and usage as single beds, double bed and bunk bed.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-30\"></span>Layout against heat loss\n\n**Heated core.** One of the largest energy saving options in communal living is combining the heated spaces of all inhabitants into one compact space. The surface area per volume is much lower then, so the heating costs are much lower. Note that this does not mean heating only one room \u2013 just that all heated rooms together must be next to each other and their hull should have a small surface relative to the volume (means, having a sphere or cube shape). For example, a cube shaped space in the center of the house can consist of 4-8 rooms belonging to different apartments on different levels of the building. The heated rooms would be bathrooms and a multi-use kitchen / living / office space.\n\n**Unheated periphery.** Around this heated space, the non-heated rooms would be arranged, including bedrooms, storage rooms, workshop area etc.. They are kept warm-ish by the waste heat escaping through the walls of the heated space. Of course, the walls of the heated space would be well insulated, like outdoor walls. As the non-heated rooms would have the same insulation on the outside walls and at the walls of heated rooms, their temperature will be about halfway between the outside temperature and the temperature in heated rooms, so rarely lower than 10 \u00b0C in a central European winter.\n\n**A building that grows and shrinks on demand.** Generalizing the concept discussed above, one could even organize rooms in a core and one or more shells so that all rooms are insulated against each other just as well as the house is insulated against the outside. Each room will then be \u201cheated\u201d, \u201cunheated\u201d or \u201csemi-heated\u201d, the latter being applicable for people with warm or heated clothing. Since all walls, inner and outer, are insulated to the same level, this means that the house can energetically shrink to become a small house, and grow again to a larger house, as needed. By concentrating the actively used space as close to the core as much as possible, the house will maintain a compact surface, which helps to lower heating demand. Because insulation material also has embodied energy and emissions, this makes only sense when the additional indoor insulation has very little of that \u2013 see section \u201cUpcycled building insulation\u201d for a solution.\n\n**Summer and winter living rooms.** When enough space is available, it could be a good idea to have two living rooms: an unheated summertime living room that is made to be comfortable on hot days, and a cozy wintertime living room. After all, being comfortable with the same furniture and equipment year-round is only possible when the room has an artificially controlled climate \u2013 when trying to avoid or minimize this, it is obvious that different climates call for different rooms. The summertime living room could for example be attached to a rooftop terrace, and people would use it with their street clothes and shoes. In contrast, the wintertime living room would be meant to be used without shoes, as the floor and other surfaces would be meant to sit on, and would be covered in blankets and cushions. That room would be relatively small, have a cozy style and let people stay closer to each other \u2013 simply because a small space with many people is warmer than a large space with few people. The room itself would usually be unheated, but the waste heat from people and small heated spaces inside it would usually provide a room temperature of 14 \u00b0C or higher. It would feature cozy heated furniture such as a Japanese [*kotatsu*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotatsu)* *table \u2013 a small, blanket-covered table with a heat source underneath where everyone puts their legs below.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-31\"></span>Ecological indoor construction\n\nIt will be difficult to apply cob and other natural, upcycled or otherwise low-footprint building materials on the structural parts of buildings due to legal regulations and durability in outdoor conditions. However, all kinds of separation walls, thermal mass and sound insulation elements on the inside can be built from cob and other natural materials that \u201ccan be sourced in the backyard\u201d. This is esp. useful when the stories of a building only have structural outside walls and just pillars inside, and when the ceilings are durable enough to carry the additional weight of indoor cob walls.\n\nExample techniques:\n\n-   **Indoor cob plastering.** This can easily be applied in urban living situations, both with respect to looks and practical considerations. See for example how it is used in [this refurbishing project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DryLv9smxgU). Cob can usually be made from local soil on-site, as most soils contain a certain amount of clay that can be extracted.\n-   **Wattle and daub.** Can be used for indoor separation walls of varying thickness.\n-   [**Papercrete**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papercrete)**.** Papercrete is a light and well-insulating material that can be locally made into blocks or poured into whole walls with just trash paper and concrete as its ingredients. To make it more sustainable, one could experiment with replacing a part of its portland cement content with [alternative cement](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/materials/alternative-cement). That should be possible, as papercrete walls are usually not made to be load-bearing anyway.\n\n**Literature:** (all works are available online in open access fashion)\n\n-   [**Modern Masonry Natural Stone and Clay Products**](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/9551)**.** 1956. 164 pages.\n-   [**Handbook for building homes of earth**](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002463126)**.** 1980. 159 pages.\n-   [**Stone: An Introduction**](http://www.fastonline.org/CD3WD_40/JF/440/33-807.pdf)**.** 149 pages. with everything you ever wanted and didn\u2019t want to know about using stone as a building material, how to work it etc\u2026\n-   [**Bamboo as a building material**](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007405636)**.** 1982. 52 pages.\n-   [**Building stone, lathing, plastering, and tiling, common brickwork, ornamental brickwork and terra cotta, lighting fixtures, use and design of lighting fixtures, architectural design**](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008411031)**.** 1909. 496 pages.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-32\"></span>Efficiencies of shabby chic\n\n**Build something old, not something new.** Trying a conversion to make an old space look new is difficult, esp. on a budget. But trying to make an old space look old but great is much simpler and cheaper. It just needs old materials and good \u201cshabby chic\u201d taste. This is similar to the approach of building maintenance over new construction, just that it is here extended beyond the building and to the interior. The idea is to \u201ckeep the old look and work well\u201d, so that there is never ever a need for \u201crenovation\u201d. In fact, some old buildings with proper, nicely designed and thought-through (but not costly or carbon intensive) interior feel way more homely than modern, mass manufactured buildings with their white, minimalist aesthetics. How can a practice of communal living be built around this idea? How could that include household-size elements of a circular economy (basically \u201cthrowing nothing away\u201d)? That also includes household-level production from raw materials that would usually be thrown away. It would extend to all areas of life, including a \u201cshabby chic\u201d clothing style. And it is not at all clear at the moment what that even means.\n\n**Inspirations from around the world.** In traditional Japanese aesthetics, [*wabi-sabi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi), \u201cthe beauty of imperfection\u201d, is about products made in a shabby chic style from the start. And the Japanese technique of [*kintsugi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi) is about repairing broken ceramic vessels with gold, and can be seen as a celebration of breakage and repair as a part of the lifetime of objects.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-33\"></span>Upcycled and DIY furniture\n\nMost modern furniture items are still very simple products without moving parts and without difficult requirements. They can be made from a multitude of discarded materials with hand tools and creativity, and if done right can provide an artful, aesthetically pleasing furniture system that (because it\u2019s upcycled) has zero embodied emissions. This kind of DIY furniture is also very suitable for households still experimenting with ecological living as these items can be modified much easier than commercial \u201chigh finish\u201d furniture items \u2013 and while experimenting, changes are required all the time.\n\nSome ideas for upcycled furniture are provided below:\n\n**Cardboard furniture system.** This is zero-footprint furniture by combining trashed cardboard (glued together into boards of 1-5 cm thickness) and 3D printed parts as connectors and accessories. The furniture \"boards\" can be cut with woodworking tools incl. a tablesaw. Only 2D cutting and 3D printing would be needed, which means that this furniture can be produced by anyone. Since 3D printed parts can be recycled into 3D printing filament, and since all 3D printing and tool use can be done with locally produced solar electricity, and since a city always has more than enough trashed cardboard around, all this furniture can be produced at zero cost. This allows to produce it on demand, even for single occasions. To be a system, it would be based on (mostly) standard 3D printed connector parts (for inspiration, see PlayWood, https://www.playwood.it/ ). And it would use cardboard sheet material \"boards\" in standard thicknesses of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 cm only, which would be produced in advance and stocked in larger amounts in the house.\n\n**Furniture from urban bamboo.** Bamboo is a material that with significant potential to reduce GHG emissions ([see](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/land-use/bamboo)). The idea is to grow enough bamboo around the house and in the local neighborhood for all structural needs inside the house. All furniture etc. would be created and re-created with this bamboo and household tools, and at the end of its lifetime bamboo furniture would be composted or burned in-house. Basically, grow timber bamboo around all walls of the house. The bamboos would be ca. 50 cm away from the wall and grow between the wall and bars surrounding the wall in ca. 70 cm distance at the level of every story. This prevents the bamboos from falling over in case of storms etc.. If necessary, the bamboos would be grown in containers to prevent their roots from interfering with building walls etc..\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-34\"></span>Noise management\n\nIdeally, the same space would be used as both living area, kitchen area and working are (for office work etc.) combined, because that reduces the amount of required heated space in the building, and of space (and associated embodied energy) in total. However, in compact and esp. communal living spaces, space is no longer available as a way to counter noise problems. For example, if your partner snores, just having separate sleeping rooms is not an option.\n\nHere are various ways to try for managing noise without needing more space:\n\n-   **Earplugs.** These are a good solution \u2013 consider always carrying a few reusable silicone earplugs in your jacket. They also help in public transport, which is very noisy as it needs to be designed for the hard of hearing. So if you have sensitive ears, plop in the plugs and arrive much more relaxed.\n-   **Headphone earplugs.** Similarly, tight-sealing headphone earplugs work well to drown out annoying noises in public transport, or if you sleep close to someone who snores, or if there is a lot of traffic where you sleep. For sleep, even damaged earplugs where only one side works are fine (you can cut away the other side). Make sure you don\u2019t damage the earplugs\u2019 wire or the connected MP3 player or smartphone. That can be a challenge at night, so it may be justified to look for some well sealing, used wireless earplugs, even if their battery is weak.\n-   **Noise-canceling headsets.** People who need to concentrate (to work at the computer etc.) would use active noise-canceling headsets, including with appropriate music to drown the rest of the noises\n-   **Signaling mechanisms.** In communal spaces, people would be able to register the need for some quietness, and this would be signaled with colored lamp or similar in the middle of the room; in response, the others would not speak louder than necessary.\n-   **Noise-canceling furniture.** People who are on the phone or in talks with 2-4 people in the room would use specially designed noise-canceling tables, equipped with nice looking noise-canceling cones.\n-   **Low-noise rooms.** Here, a lot of noise-canceling cones and architectural elements would be distributed around the room, the idea being that people don't really hear each other when being further than 5 m from each other.\n-   **Don\u2019t yell, message.** In communal spaces, people would wear headsets to send voice messages to each other rather than screaming through the room\n\n## <span id=\"anchor-35\"></span>Heating\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-36\"></span>Upcycled building insulation\n\nInsulation saves on heating energy, but is also a major source of a building\u2019s embodied greenhouse gas emissions due to the energy intensive manufacturing process. The more houses are heated with sustainably produced heat, the higher the proportion of emissions embodied in insulation. For a fully carbon-neutral house, its insulation also has to be carbon neutral.\n\nFortunately, many everyday materials can be reused as insulation. High-tech insulation with a very low [thermal conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity) is not \u201cbetter\u201d in an absolute sense: the exact same insulation effect can be achieved with thicker material of higher thermal conductivity, and the lost space can be easily recovered with better space utilization. Now if a material reused as insulation would otherwise have been incinerated of landfilled, using it as insulation is basically emission-free.\n\n**Examples of zero-emission insulation.** Below are several options for such materials.\n\n-   **Used building insulation material.** This includes glass wool, rock wool and expanded polystyrene. Usually this material is landfilled or incinerated when a building is demolished, so its further use is zero-emission. Lifecycle analysis shows that the energy needed for building construction and for heating the building over its lifetime are about the same for modern buildings; for very low-energy buildings heating energy demand will be somewhat lower, in exchange for somewhat higher energy embodied in construction ([source](https://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/a-article21280049.html)). This means that very significant energy savings can be made by reusing existing building materials. In contrast to industrial recycling processes, re-use needs very low additional energy input. One of the materials that is simplest to re-use is glass wool and rock wool because damages sheet material can be processes into loose flakes, similar to blow-in glass wool or rock wool material.\n-   **Expanded polystyrene.** Polystyrene foam from old buildings, packaging etc. is typically simply burned, but it can easily be remanufactured by gluing it into new blocks with a simple press.\n-   **Fibers and fabric from old clothes.** They can be stuffed into containers that are then used as insulation blocks indoors. Or they can be manufactured into fiber mats and blocks by disintegrating the fabric first into fibrous material.\n-   **Plastic bags and plastic film.** Plastic bags are still a fact of life, and will be for some time. Also, plastic films in more general are a waste product from packaging etc.. Blocks of slightly compressed, crumpled plastic bags are probably good insulators: they are light, cheap, trap a lot of air in small spaces (which is how insulation works), do not rot, do not let air pass through but are also not completely airtight. Also plastic itself has a relatively low thermal conductivity \u2013 blocks made from crumpled aluminium foil would perform worse.\n-   **PU insulation from old refrigerators.** Refrigerators contain a lot of PU insulation foam, but it is currently not recycled. It makes for a very good building wall insulator, though (nearly twice as good as rockwool), so it makes sense to use it for that purpose in buildings. First, obtain it from waste collection stations by extracting it from fridges brought there. Then use a semi-automatic setup to cut the insulation into cuboid shapes of compatible sizes, using as much of the fridge insulation as possible. Finally, glue these small blocks together to insulation elements of any size.\n-   **Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and papercrete insulation blocks.** Pressed into a form with air chambers. Applied indoors by building walls from these building blocks. It is probably also possible to create papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 blocks with a porous structure for better insulation, by mixing them with a baking agent / leavening agent and heating the block while it is still wet.\n-   **Corrugated cardboard insulation blocks.** Just collect corrugated cardboard from shipments, from neighbors etc. and glue the layers together with wallpaper glue. Powertools can help to shape the blocks so that they lock together like puzzle pieces. For example, massive 60\u00d740\u00d740 cm blocks can be glued from many layers of corrugated cardboard, and in such a way that they fit together like puzzle pieces into the room they are meant for. (This will need some 3D CAD, scripting some own software, a laser cutter or CNC mill, and a station with registration sticks to assemble the pieces.)\n\n**Improving insulation over time.** An interesting aspect of reusing material as insulation is that a household can improve its insulation over time by simply collecting and using the old clothing, plastic bags etc. that would otherwise be thrown away. After 10 years, the house might have a 1 m layer of insulation all around.\n\n**Fire safety.** The main issue with these insulation materials is of course fire safety, but that is manageable. For example by using non-flammable boxes to contain the material, and by using these blocks only indoors, together with a good system of detecting and extinguishing fires early.\n\n**Usage as indoor insulation.** Basically all existing projects for energetic retrofitting add insulation layers to the outside of the house. That is expensive, as the material must be weatherproof. However, there is so much unused building stock and the area per person is also so much larger than in the past that it is not necessary at all to add to the outside \u2013 it's ok when the rooms shrink because of adding insulation. That is much, much cheaper, as the same outer shell of the house can still be used for weather protection, and much cheaper materials can be used inside.\n\nSo it is recommendable to use the experimental materials listed above as insulation on the inside of a building, until enough experience with their behavior and use has been obtained. It allows better monitoring and quick interventions if something goes wrong (for example, if condensation develops). This also solves the problem how to use these \u201cunlicenced\u201d DIY materials for building insulation. Namely: simply use them as \"furniture\" inside the rooms, without installing them in a fixed way. Then, nobody can prohibit their use. Ideally, make them indeed be furniture, by integrating shelf space etc. into the inside facing side of the insulation blocks.\n\n**Condensation issues.** Condensation is the main challenge when using indoor insulation as proposed above. However, there are also multiple unexplored ways of dealing with this. Condensation would develop on the insides of the outer walls when warmer, humid air comes in contact with that wall and cools below its condensation point. To prevent that from happening, a 5 cm gap between the outer walls and the indoor insulation is a good idea. This allows to monitor relative humidity of the air inside and keep that low enough by one of the following methods:\n\n-   Regularly circulating dry air behind the wall, for example by operating a closed-cycle electric dehumidifier.\n-   Using cartridges of chemical drying agent embedded into the indoor insulation that keep the air behind it dry. Probably one would use calcium chloride cartridges and make both these cartridges and the brine container with condensate accessible from the inside of the rooms. Exchanging these would only necessary every 1-3 years and the time to do so would easily be recognizable from the fill mark of the condensate container, visible from inside the room.\n-   Circulating cold outside air inside that gap, which can only warm up there and thus will never lead to condensation. That effectively removes the additional insulating properties of the outer walls, so that their sole function would be weather protection and providing the building structure. However, the loss of insulation is not severe for uninsulated outside walls and can be compensated by adding some more indoor insulation.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-37\"></span>Insulated indoor clothing\n\nWhen they can choose, people prefer a warm room and thin clothing over a cooler room and warm clothing. This seems to be because warm clothing is often heavy, uncomfortable and movement inhibiting.\n\nIt does not have to be like this. Heated clothing is the most extreme solution to this challenge, but before going that way, a new style of indoor clothing can go a long way. Even with just one light down jacket and a shawl, comfortable desk work is permanently possible down to 14.5 \u00b0C (data point by @matthias). With highly optimized but unheated clothing, it should be comfortable down to 10 \u00b0C, perhaps even to 8 \u00b0C.\n\nA few design hints from personal experiments include:\n\n-   The clothing should be very light and very compressible, because that makes it not inhibit any movements. Down clothing with very light ripstop fabric is so far the best choice, both for jackets and trousers.\n-   A shawl is a surprisingly effective piece of clothing.\n-   Footwear deserves special attention as the feet are usually the first part of the body to start feeling cold, both because the feet have low blood circulation esp. at rest, and because air close to the floor is usually the coldest air in the room. There are some aerogel insulated outdoor shoes produced commercially. An aerogel insulated indoor shoe could become a well-loved type of clothing, and lends itself to DIY production.\n\nAs a side benefit, it may be that resistance against respiratory infections is higher for people who are acclimatized to inhaling cool air because they live in cool rooms all the time. This is just anecdotal evidence for now (by @matthias) but there might be studies or other data to confirm it.\n\n**Engineering clothing like insulation.** The right approach for creating better clothing for cold environments is to perceive clothing as insulation and to apply all the tools and calculations to it that are so far only applied to houses, including:\n\n-   -   thermal imaging to determine the total energy lost to the environment\n    -   fuel consumption tracking, by measuring the CO2 content and volume of every breath before and after breathing (helps to deal with the metabolic base load that is different at different times of the day and night cycle)\n    -   determining thermal conductivity values of clothing\n    -   dealing with convective heat losses by limiting the amount of warm air that can escape at the neck, at the sleeves and from uncovered skin\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-38\"></span>Heated clothing\n\nFor grid-connected indoor environments, using electrically heated clothing (switching to an electricity supplier that provides renewable energy) is the simplest way to provide heating that is both ecologically and financially sustainable. Heating whole rooms with grid electricity would, on the other hand, be expensive.\n\nNext to small heated spaces, heated clothing is the second major way of avoiding space heating \u2013 it is even more experimental and \u201cextreme\u201d, though. Heated clothes exist for outdoor activities, but nearly all of them use batteries (which is uneconomical for permanent use) or use catalytic fuel burners (which is inadequate for indoor use). Our initial ideas for R&D to solve these challenges include the following engineering proposals and extensions:\n\n##### Engineering proposals\n\n**IR-transparent radiatively heated clothing. **The idea is to heat the body with short-wave IR (like the IR part of sunlight, emitted by items 300-800 \u00b0C hot) and to keep the long-wave IR that results from this (emitted by the body at a surface temperature of 25-45 \u00b0C). So we need insulation that is transparent for short-wave IR and intransparent for long-wave IR. For example black underwear clothing on top of which one wears a kind of bubble wrap clothing form plastic film that has these desired properties.\n\n**Inductively heated clothing.** Heated clothing could be heated inductively, with metal in the shoesoles or carbon fiber in the trousers (and then induction sources in the seat surface and backrest). This allows to even transmit the energy through a layer of insulation. Instead of direct inductive heating (as in an induction stove), induction can also be used to transmit electricity wirelessly, and with that power the clothing and even charge a thermal storage and / or battery. So when sitting on a chair or armchair, the bottom and / or backrest would have induction loops. And even the floor can have induction loops inside, working while standing in certain locations (in the kitchen etc.).\n\n**Heat-pump heated clothing.** Electrically heated clothing is nice because there are no exhaust fumes to deal with, but battery storage is expensive and also not enough to provide a full day of runtime for heated clothing. However, the heating value of electrical energy can be raised by 300-400% by employing a heat pump. For a heating output of 100 W (the same as the body's own average heat generation), one would then only need 25-33 W of electrical power, compared to 100 W for resistive heating. This could make batteries light and cheap enough to power heated clothing.\n\n**Electrically heated clothing with nickel-iron battery.** Batteries can be used safely indoors for heated clothing, as there are no explosion hazards and no toxic fumes. The only reason against them is that they degrade, which means the cost of electricity (and its environmental cost) is high. That's not true however when using nickel-iron batteries, as these do not degrade. These batteries are relatively heavy compared to lithium-ion batteries (about three times as heavy), but for indoor use that is acceptable, esp. when using energy-efficient heated clothing based on heat pump technology. Also, they are still about three times lighter than supercaps, the only other way to store electricity in non-degrading storage. One would simply exchange the battery with another one after about two hours of use, and every room would have a battery swap and charging station in reach. Also, when doing seated work, one would attach an electrical quick connector or even be connected automatically (see above), which charges the battery and extends the runtime considerably. So during most days, one would not have to exchange the battery pack at all.\n\n**Heat buffer heated clothing.** Water is a harmless chemical with a very high heat capacity (4180 J/(kg\\*K)) and a suitable choice for a thermal mass \u201cheat battery\u201d to extend the usage time of heated clothing without any need for batteries. To create a heat buffer that lasts 3 hours with an output of 100 W (the same as the human body at rest and probably suitable for most use cases of heated clothing), one would need 300 Wh of stored energy in heat usable for body heating, here defined as heat &gt;30 \u00b0C. That requires an amount of ~3.7 l of water at 100 \u00b0C ([see](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+%2F+%284180+J%2F%28kg*K%29+%2F+300+Wh+*+70+K%29+to+g&assumption=%22UnitClash%22+-%3E+%7B%22g%22%2C+%7B%22Grams%22%7D%7D&assumption=%22UnitClash%22+-%3E+%7B%22J%2F%28kg*K%29%22%2C+%7B%22JoulesPerKilogramKelvinDifference%22%7D%7D&assumption=%22UnitClash%22+-%3E+%7B%22K%22%2C+%7B%22KelvinsDifference%22%7D%7D)). It seems possible to integrate these 3.7 kg of hot water into clothing comfortably, though that might also be the upper limit. Anyway, 3 hours of mobile operation is quite a comfortable solution already. The water would be re-heated whenever an electrical connection is available (see above) and could also be exchanged within 10-20 seconds with a quick connector hose attached to a reservoir. This is a much faster additional option compared to the 6-10 minutes that would be required for electrical re-heating with SELV electricity.\n\nThe innovation here is heated clothing without being permanently tethered to an electricity outlet, and also without using batteries (which would make a kWh of electricity even more expensive). The idea is to carry a small vacuum insulated stainless steel metal can around that is filled with material with a high heat capacity and heated to a high temperature. Fireclay or chrome-nickel steel plates are useful here. When connecting a cable to the grid, the material is heated within 30 seconds, and that heat should then be able to power the heated clothing for another 60-80 minutes. The heated clothing system would then have a battery, fans and perhaps water circulation to distribute that warmth in the clothing over time. During stationery work or activities, one would keep the charging cable plugged in, and the heat battery would charge much slower (and after that only take the \"maintenance charge power\") to prevent heavy short-time loads on the grid.\n\nDoing the numbers: Assuming 20 seconds and 30 minutes and a heat output of the heated clothing of 100 W (doubling the body's heat output), 50 Wh would have to be provided in 20 s, which means a power rating of 9 kW (qalc \"(50 Wh/20 s) to W\"). That's possible with three-phase electricity in households (up to 3 \\* 3.5 kW = 10.5 kW), but might be difficult to integrate into a device with a small form factor. A charging time of 60 seconds at 3 kW seems more appropriate. Now when using steel (such as stainless steel) at 900 K over ambient temperature, the amount of material needed to store these 50 Wh would be 421 g (see qalc \"1 / (475 J/(kg\\*K) / 50 Wh \\* 900 K) to g\"). Water can only be used to 100 \u00b0C or maybe 180 \u00b0C in a pressure vessel, but has a much higher heat capacity. Assuming 100 \u00b0C (which is pressureless water and thus safe) means 70 \u00b0C over skin temperature, so the mass of water needed would be 615 g (see qalc \"1 / (4180 J/(kg\\*K) / 50 Wh \\* 70 K) to g\").\n\nAs pressureless water does not pose the fire and burn hazards of steel at 900 \u00b0C, this seems to be the route to go. With a proper design, up to 4 kg of water could be incorporated into the clothing itself while keeping it comfortable. That would cover up to 3.5 hours at 100 W heat output. For example, a vest with half-length arms made from a kind of foam that soaks up the hot water and has aerogel insulation on the inside and outside to store the heat and only slowly release it. Assuming a use for 16 hours a day at 100 W average heat output, that would amount to 1.6 kWh of energy per day, or about 1.6 kWh \\* 180 days = 288 kWh per heating period. At 0.30 EUR/kWh, that would be 86 EUR per person in heating costs. In pratice in a moderate climate, it could be half that as one would not need the full output during the full wake period of the day.\n\nIn other circumstances, such as off-grid households, the recharging would be done by burning carbon-neutral fuel such as ethanol, biogas, woodgas or wood pellets. Since the fuel burner will not be permanently active and can be placed in a fixed position to vent outdoors, there is no problem with indoor use here. To recharge, the cold water in the clothing would be exchanged with hot water, which can be done very fast. Since this allows to buffer hot water in an insulated vessel for future uses, it also allows to use a very small (cheap) burner to heat that water. It would not have to be much more than 100 W in output, as that is the heat output needed.\n\nTo make the use of the heated clothing comfortable, it can be integrated with some of the habits of living, esp. getting meals and snacks. So when going from the workshop downstairs to have a coffee, you recharge the heat battery as well.\n\n**Hydrogen heated clothing. **Hydrogen has the advantage that its combustion product is just harmless water \u2013 and some nitrous oxides, but that can probably be eliminated when using catalytic conversion rather than an open flame. That in principle allows to use it indoors. Since \"charging points\" are easily available indoors, a hydrogen tank with limited storage (such as compressed gas at 20 bars) is acceptable. One would have to recharge every 2-3 hours for a few seconds. Catalytic conversion rather than an open flame is also preferable for fire safety and explosion safety of the hydrogen powered device. It will generate low-temperature heat, but that is acceptable for this purpose.\n\n**Ethanol heated clothing for outdoor use.** For outdoor use away from the house, we would like a longer mobile use time, ideally a full day awake (16-20 hours). This becomes possible because outdoor use allows burning fuel safely. Ethanol produced from renewable resources is a suitable, energy dense and safe fuel for this purpose. A mobile burner unit would be carried as a backpack or detachable handbag and would re-heat the 3.7 l of hot water whenever necessary. This is not strictly about ecological living, but a way to transform the human relation to outdoor space as a nice side effect: suddenly, it will be comfortable to have an outdoor dinner in winter, to cook outdoors etc.. This in turn might prompt other lifestyle adjustments: why have a large living room when the outdoor area is now comfortable even in the midst of winter?\n\n##### Possible extensions\n\n**Electrical quick connectors.** Many activities in the home are stationery, including screen work, kitchen work and resting / sleeping. Electrically heated clothing that is connected to a (very safe!) [SELV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-low_voltage#Separated_or_safety_extra-low_voltage_(SELV)) DC energy supply with a spiral cable and magnetic tear-away quick connector could be a comfortable option. The human body does not immediately feel cold when \u201cturning off the heating\u201d, but rather has enough stored heat for staying comfortable for 1-1.5 hours in cool (8-10\u00b0C) environments, given suitable clothing. This means that only an occasional connection to electricity is enough to keep warm with heated clothing.\n\n**Automatic connection.** For indoor use, electrically heated clothing is a good idea but it won't achieve widespread adoption if (1) its use is expensive due to battery power or (2) people have to permanently remember to connect and disconnect a cable when sitting down resp. standing up. For that reason, automatic connection is better than the electrical quick connectors proposed above, and might be realized in one or more of the following ways:\n\n-   inductive connection, like of an inductive charger, using material embedded in the contact surface of a chair and the clothing\n-   inductive connection, but with material embedded into the floor / carpet and into the shoes\n-   as before, but using a metal contact connection so that a low-voltage connection is automatically established between contacts in the floor and shoes resp. in the chair and trousers after an electronic system determined contact pairs that will not lead to short-circuiting; as all contacts are powerless before this automated test is done, the system is protected against short-circuiting from dropping metal objects on the contacts etc.\n\n**Air pre-heating collar.** Heated clothing on its own cannot completely replace space heating, as it runs into a limit at the temperature where cold air becomes too cold to breathe permanently. That limit is about 15 \u00b0C, as air is becoming uncomfortable / irritating to the throat then. With a shawl, that limit can be pushed to about 12.5 \u00b0C. Now the idea is here to create a new piece of clothing that supplies pre-heated air to the nose for breathing in. With such a device that would pre-heat air to 15 \u00b0C and together with heated clothing one might be comfortable in rooms down to 0 \u00b0C or even below, which means no space heating is needed at all anymore, with the exception of the bathroom. The new limit will probably be when the hands are getting too cold and using heated gloves is not possible due to the nature of the work.\n\nThe device would look a bit like a shawl with an integrated fan. It would supply the air with the fan not constantly, but only when one breathes in, and would run the fan in reverse to take in the exhale air in order to extract heat from it for pre-heating in the inhale air. An air-air heat exchanger would be used for this mechanism, to avoid providing very moist air for inhaling. Perhaps 10 W of pre-heating would be needed in addition, depending on temperature. This can be provided with a catalytic pocket stove, with a small ethanol or LPG flame, or electrically. Even when provided electrically from a battery, it would be possible to create a device with a full day of runtime. Obviously, when this device is used in combination with heated clothing, then it can be water heated or electrically heated (with a cable connection), the same way as the heated clothing itself. Also, a pulsing or even constant flow of warm air is all that's needed, as there are no extreme requirements for energy conservation in such a situation.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-39\"></span>Small heated spaces\n\nSmall heated spaces are alternatives to heating complete rooms or even the complete building. Rather, one would just heat a small space inside a room. These small heated spaces can take many forms, and can embody feelings of cozyness and [hygge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygge), providing comfort through the cold part of the year. Obviously, proper design is important to achieve this and make people love their small heated spaces.\n\n**Examples.** Small heated spaces can take many forms, and most of them are unexplored. Example ideas include:\n\n-   a \u201cbed cave\u201d\n-   an enclosed screen workspace inside a larger office\n-   an enclosed kitchen corner, for example using ceiling-high insulated glass walls as separation from the living area\n-   heated Japanese [*kotatsu*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotatsu) table for the living room\n-   heated office chair\n-   heated armchair, complete with a plushy cushion, blanket, warm shoes or footrest, into which one can completely disappear and that will then insulate the body\n-   heated dining space, perhaps scalable to the amount of people taking part in a meal\n-   heated bed, convertible between winter (cave style with heating) and summer (open style) modes\n-   water-heated mattress, as an alternative to an enclosed heated bed; the mattress would be connected to the hot water line of the space heating system and thus be more energy efficient than existing, resistively heated electrical blankets or mattresses\n-   heated computer corner, with the computer (~20 W) and human body (~100 W) heating up the space\n-   heated small bathroom, distinct from a larger bathroom with shower etc. that would only be heated on demand\n-   heated shower cabin, which avoids the need to heat the whole bathroom\n\n**Small spaces heated by usage.** The architecture and thermodynamics of such small indoor spaces is largely unexplored. Some can probably be made self-heating \u2013 for example, a comfortable \u201cdining cave\u201d might be heated by the presence of people (100 W each) and pots of hot food. A glass-enclosed kitchen corner is pretty surely self-heating by its use. A superinsulated small living room will be self-heating (to, say, a comfortable 17 \u00b0C) when enough people are present inside and the outside environment is not too cold.\n\n**Small spaces heated with waste heat.** Electric and electronic devices in a household produce a lot of waste heat, because ultimately all power ends up as heat. For example, the average German citizen using 6.5 kWh of electrical energy per day translates to 6.5 kWh of internal heat gains of the building per day. For comparison, a small space of 4\u00d72\u00d72 m with one person inside and 10 cm PU foam insulation all around will require an average of 8.7 kWh/day through the German winter for an average inside temperature of 14 \u00b0C (experiments by @matthias). So the electrical waste heat of two people\u2019s consumption \u2013 a power output of (2 \u00d7 6.5 kWh) / 24 h = 540 W \u2013 would be already enough to keep such a space at a comfortable room temperature. To make this possible, the waste heat of electrical devices would have to be concentrated in such spaces. This is possible to an extent, for example by letting the back of the fridge and freezer face into that space, and by locating the wifi router etc. there as well. Computers are a good case actually: their waste heat is just waste in data centers, but the combination of fast Internet connections, data efficient websites and CDNs makes it possible to self-house a web server, using its waste heat as space heating. Similarly, the waste heat from shower water could be directly used for keeping a small heated space warm, by routing the shower water to a temporary storage tank inside that space (see section \u201cwastewater heat recovery\u201d for details).\n\n**Small spaces heated with heat pumps.** Air source heat pumps inside the small space that take their heat from the enclosing room are an efficient way to provide the heating: their air source will be air at 10 \u00b0C or warmer, at which temperature heat pumps are pretty efficient. A cheap and DIY solution is to place a fridge into the small heated space, and to circulate air between the surrounding space and the inside of the fridge using two hoses and small fans. A fridge is a heat pump and will heat up the small space with its \u201cwaste heat\u201d, extracted from the air circulating in it. This basically shovels the heat back that escaped from the small space into the surrounding room, which is how electric efficiencies of 250-350% are reached, compared to 100% for electric resistance heating. A Japanese [*kotatsu*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotatsu) table with a heat pump as its heat source for example would be an interesting combination of old and new technology, saving two thirds of electrical energy compared to the current versions which are heated with an electrical resistor.\n\n**Saving 75% of heating energy with small heated spaces.** Heating is currently one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions, both inside buildings and as a fraction of global emissions ([source](https://architecture2030.org/buildings_problem_why/)). Lowering the indoor temperature has major impacts on the heating energy use: for example, a detailed computer modeling study based on the UK housing stock estimates that lowering the thermostat setting from 19 \u00b0C to 18 \u00b0C will result in 13% savings of space heating energy ([source](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/128720/6923-how-much-energy-could-be-saved-by-making-small-cha.pdf#page=26)). The same study shows an almost linear correlation: lowering the indoor temperature by 2 \u00b0C will lead to 25% savings of space heating energy. Also note that the amount of energy savings per degree change in room temperature varies considerably between buildings \u2013 to determine it experimentally for one building, [see here](http://blog.kwiqly.com/2011/12/energy-savings-they-think-you-ought-to.html).\n\nNow the above idea of *only* heating the small heated spaces will probably result in an indoor temperature outside of these small spaces of about 13 \u00b0C during the heating season. It cannot be much lower, as 13 \u00b0C is close to a lower bound for air that is still comfortable and healthy even under prolonged exposure and with the body at rest. That\u2019s a reduction of 6 \u00b0C compared to a usual 19 \u00b0C room temperature, and would lead to expected savings of 75% of heating energy, still assuming a linear relationship. A 75% reduction in space heating energy is a huge amount, given that space heating takes up the largest amount of energy and on average still uses the largest amount of fossil fuels in a building. Compared with other energy-saving behavior adaptations, it saves more than 11 times as much energy than the next best one that is not related to space heating (namely \u201cInstall water efficient shower head and use twice every day\u201d, see [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/128720/6923-how-much-energy-could-be-saved-by-making-small-cha.pdf#page=16)).\n\n**Additional savings of embodied energy.** Finally, there is an additional major energy saving related to the embodied energy of a building: manufacturing insulation material is energy intensive, and much less of it is needed when providing small heated spaces inside non-insulated larger spaces. Also, the insulation for small heated spaces can be made from salvaged materials as it does not have to withstand outdoor conditions for years. For example, paper, cardboard, crumpled plastic bags etc. are good insulation material and represent zero embodied energy when they are recovered from waste material.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-40\"></span>Small interventions for heating efficiency\n\n-   **Room temperature of 14 \u00b0C.** It may not be this exact temperature for everyone, but it turns out (from initial experiments by @matthias) that with suitable clothing, something around this temperature is perfectly comfortable even for seated work. It may be that the human body needs a few weeks to acclimatize. In addition, you probably need a solution for humidity management to prevent issues with condensation and mold.\n-   **Anti-draught measures.** The building should be tightened against draughts of cold air as much as possible. There are ways to measure how tight a building is by inducing slight overpressure with a large fan.\n-   **Focusing on windows.** \u201cAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, heat that either escapes or enters windows accounts for roughly 30 percent of the energy used to heat and cool buildings.\u201d ([source](http://news.mit.edu/2020/preventing-energy-loss-through-windows-0106)). A simple and effective intervention are for example insulation blocks from polyurethane or polystyrene foam that are placed into the window cavities of unused windows from the inside, and of all windows after dark. The insulation blocks would be equipped with a bag of rechargeable drying agent (as available for cars) in a pouch on the side facing the window pane, preventing any issues with condensation and mould problems in that area.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-41\"></span>Seasonal heat storage\n\nGround source or air source heat pumps are the state of the art for emission-free space heating. Here, \u201cTest results \\[of the [coefficient of performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_performance)\\] of the best systems are around 4.5. When measuring installed units over a whole season and accounting for the energy needed to pump water through the piping systems, seasonal COP\u2019s are around 3.5 or less.\u201d ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_performance#Derivation)). This relates to the European standard test conditions of 0 \u00b0C source and 35 \u00b0C sink temperature.\n\nIn comparison, seasonal thermal energy storage with a combination of water tanks and boreholes already provides a seasonal coefficient of performance of 27, also accounting for all pumping energy ([source](https://www.dlsc.ca/reports/swc2017-0033-Mesquita.pdf#page=5), p. 5, using data for years 7-10 where the system was fully charged). So for every unit of electrical energy, BTES provides 770% as much heat as state-of-the-art ground source heat pumps! Even the theoretical maximum for heat pumps under the above standard test conditions is just a COP of 8.8 ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_performance#Derivation)).\n\nThe [Drake Landing Solar Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Landing_Solar_Community) system of water tanks and boreholes used as an example here provided on average 96% of all space heating from solar energy ([source](https://www.dlsc.ca/reports/swc2017-0033-Mesquita.pdf#page=5), p. 5). As it works with just pumps and no heat pumps at all, this is a DIY friendly and simple system. Also, as it is the first system of its kind, so it certainly has plenty of room for cost savings and further optimization, all of which can be pioneered in urban ecological living projects. During the 10 year runtime since the start of that project they were already able to lower the pumping energy requirements considerably: \u201cThe main strategy to reduce power consumption has been to increase the set temperature differential through the glycol loop, which leads to lower flow rates and pump speed. \\[\u2026\\] With negligible impact on collector annual efficiency, the electricity savings are calculate\\[d\\] to be approximately 50% of the amount used with the original control strategy.\u201d ([source](https://www.dlsc.ca/reports/swc2017-0033-Mesquita.pdf#page=7), p. 7). Their glycol loop needs 33.5% of their total pumping energy, so this equates to 16.75% total savings for pump electricity.\n\nAnother possible optimization concerns fully solar powered single-building systems. It seems simple to achieve 100% solar fraction continuously in a system that only serves one household. The reason that natural gas post-heating was sometimes needed in the Drake Landing project is that, depending on outside temperature, a heat fluid temperature of up to 55 \u00b0C was required, which might not be available from the BTES. However, the BTES certainly was able to provide 30 \u00b0C water, and that can be used for floor and wall heating systems in a single building that is close to a BTES in its cellar or backyard. It is just not economic to dimension all the Drake Landing district heating piping for 30 \u00b0C water to be enough even on the coldest days \u2013 adapting the fluid temperature rather than the pipe dimensions is more economic there, where much more pipework is involved.\n\nRegarding the charge / discharge efficiency of borehole thermal energy storage:\n\nReported BTES round-trip efficiency \\[of 36-41%\\] is relatively low at Drake Landing due to high groundwater flow However, other studies have reported BTES efficiencies of 80\u201390%. Thus, proper site assessment regarding groundwater flow is important to promote higher efficiencies. Seibertz et al. determined that monitoring of cooling behavior from thermal gradients makes it possible to identify high ground-water flow zones using a decay time comparison. ([source](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/6/743/pdf))\n\nIn zones of high ground water flow, BTES efficiency might be increased by underground dams, which can be as simple as burying a vertical layer of water impermeable clay around the borehole site, or simply one wall of that on the upstream side of the ground water flow. Alternatively, clay or silt could be injected in a ring of boreholes under high pressures to make the area more impermeable to groundwater flow. Or simply use all boreholes also for groundwater infiltration \u2013 after a few years and esp. with water rich in silt or clay, infiltration will no longer occur as the are around the borehole has been made water impermeable due to the silt and clay infiltration.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-42\"></span>Seasonal heat storage with ASHP charging\n\n:bulb: This is a major, unexplored innovation on top of the established seasonal thermal energy storage technology (presented [here](#heading--3-15)). It makes heating all winter with solar energy at least 46% cheaper than natural gas. So we explore this idea in detail in this dedicated section.\n\n**The concept: charging with photovoltaics and heat pumps.** The idea is here to build a seasonal thermal energy storage system that is charged in summer with photovoltaics powered heat pumps and discharged in winter without heat pumps, by running warm water directly through radiators in the building.\n\nIn contrast, all major seasonal energy storage plants ([list](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/6/743/pdf), p. 11) feature one or both of the following systems: solar thermal collector panels to charge the heat storage in summer, and heat pumps to assist with extracting heat in winter. Plants that only use heat pumps are called \u201cpassive\u201d, as they rely on the natural heat of the ground, slowly conducted from depth. In contrast, the [Drake Landing Solar Community (DLSC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Landing_Solar_Community) is one of the few large-scale systems using only solar thermal panels for charging and no heat pumps for extraction.\n\nThe reason why the concept proposed here is so far unexplored is probably because both heat pumps and photovoltaic electricity only became cheap enough since about 2015 to be able to compete with solar thermal collectors the way shown here.\n\n**Cost comparison.** The final decision for or against a new energy technology is, sadly, often purely financial: renewable energy would be much more widespread if it could compete with fossil fuel cost-wise. For heating, natural gas is the cheapest available fossil fuel option, and here the above concept provides a breakthrough 47% or more cost reduction compared to natural gas. The calculation below uses gas and electricity prices for Germany in 2019.\n\n-   **Ground-source heat pump: 0.091 EUR/kWh.** This is the most efficient storage-less way to use a heat pump. The calculation is based on 0.32 EUR/kWh grid electricity prices and using a heat pump with a COP of 3.5, which accounts for water pumping energy etc. already: 0.32 EUR / (1 kWh \\* 3.5) = 0.091 EUR/kWh.\n-   **Natural gas: 0.063 EUR/kWh.** This is simply the consumer price for natural gas in Germany in 2019 ([source](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Natural_gas_price_statistics)). Space heating costs will be somewhat higher as gas furnaces have an efficiency of 95-98% and some electricity is needed for pumping. This is neglected here.\n-   **Heat storage charged with PV + heat-pump: &lt;0.034 EUR/kWh.** The system converts 1 kWh locally produced photovoltaics electricity in summer to 3.5 kWh heat using a heat pump and stores it in the seasonal thermal energy storage. From that, 2.8 kWh is extracted again in winter, assuming a high but realistic 80% charge/discharge efficiency. The upper limit for the production cost of 1 kWh PV electricity is 0.0959 EUR, as that is the, supposedly profitable, fixed purchase price obtainable in Germany starting 2020-01-01 from selling PV electricity from plants sized 10-40 kWp ([source](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz#Photovoltaik)). This yields a cost of heating of 0.0959 EUR / 2.8 kWh = 0.034 EUR/kWh, representing a cost reduction of 1 - (0.034 EUR/kWh / 0.063 EUR/kWh) = 46% compared to natural gas and of 63% compared to ground source heat pumps operated with grid electricity.\n\n**Additional cost saving options.** Obviously, the calculations above do not account for the initial investments for heat pump and storage system. However, these costs will decrease as the technology matures, and also by extending the lifetime of the technology. There are also additional cost savings listed below that decrease cost further, so that the idea is probably financially competitive with natural gas given the current state of technology. A more detailed analysis is still needed.\n\n-   **Avoiding AC conversion.** Additional cost reductions can be realized by running the heat pumps on direct solar DC electricity. To adapt to available energy supply, heat pumps would either run at variable speed similar to water pumps that are already available for this purpose, or multiple heat pumps would run in parallel to scale consumption with production. This avoids the investment in inverters and the 6-8% conversion losses of converting DC to AC electricity.\n-   **Using second-hand PV panels.** Functional second-hand PV panels are available for about 40-50% of prices for comparable factory-new modules, and often even for free because PV modules are becoming a waste problem. The costs of electricity production can be reduced accordingly.\n-   **Zero-cost air conditioning.** The cold air or water produced by the heat pumps can be used for air conditioning, in combination with small (~2000 l) tanks of cold water as thermal mass buffers. Since air conditioning needs are only present when there is sunlight, and a heat pump for charging a STES store is basically an oversized air conditioner, no additional energy for air conditioning will be needed. If energy needs for heating and air conditioning would be the same, this halves the energy needed for them.\n-   **Saving on pumping energy.** Heat pumps need water pumps to charge the heat storage, but no water pumps to move energy from solar thermal collectors to a location close to the heat storage. Instead, electric transmission from PV panels us used, which has lower transmission losses compared to pumping against fluid friction.\n-   **Cheaper installation costs.** Installing PV panels is simpler and thus cheaper than installing thermal solar collectors, which requires a lot of insulated pipework, more heavy-duty anchoring to the room structure etc..\n\n**Additional side benefits.** The concept presented here has other benefits over thermal solar panels that do not have an immediate financial impact:\n\n-   **Electricity is more flexible.** Electricity can be used for many more purposes compared to heat, making this solution more agile and flexible than thermal solar collectors. The system is basically a severely oversized PV plant, which will be able to cover the house\u2019s electricity needs even throughout winter. It will also provide the energy for heating, but this is a less urgent need, buffered by several months of heat storage.\n-   **Suitable for all-electric energy grids.** The PV-based system proposed here fits well into the \u201call-electric\u201d strategy that many countries pursue for their transition to renewable energy. It can for example provide spare generation capacity for the grid, which the grid can use to deal with peak loads.\n-   **Avoiding grid transmission losses.** Since all solar energy is consumed locally, this avoids the 5-8% conversion and distribution losses of the electric grid. This is not true for the alternative of selling PV electricity in summer and purchasing grid electricity in winter to run a ground-source heat pump.\n-   **Avoiding peak loads on the grid.** Compared to running heat pumps directly from grid electricity in winter, this system avoids peak loads on the grid on cold winter days when everyone would want to run their heat pumps. Likewise, due to all-local electricity production and the cold water tanks, the system also avoids any peak loads (any load, in fact) on the grid for air conditioning in summer.\n-   **Additional heat available without additional equipment.** The Drake Landing Solar Community uses gas burners to post-heat water on cold winter days where the energy storage could not provide the necessary heat. A fossil-fuel free alternative is to run heat pumps with grid electricity in that case. With the system design proposed here, these heat pumps are already available, as they are used in summer to charge the heat storage. Also, some PV electricity is available even in winter, and by converting it with heat pumps to heat and storing it in hot-water tanks for short-term use, most of the additional heat requirements on winter days will not need grid electricity at all.\n-   **A seasonal storage for photovoltaic electricity.** Compared to running ground-source heat pumps in winter, this system basically provides a very large, seasonal accumulator for solar electricity. It is stored in summer when it is available in excess and used in winter. Similarly, day-to-day volatility of solar PV production in winter is also equalized via heat pumps and short-term heat storage. This is a major part of solving the volatility issue of renewable energy, here be storing it as usable heat and not as electricity.\n-   **Alleviating the urban heat island effect.** Thermal solar panels of ~34% module efficiency are basically black surfaces that convert all sunlight to heat and route 34% underground while 66% heats the air, contributing to the urban heat island effect. In contrast, PV modules with 21% module efficiency coupled with a COP 4.5 heat pump will, on the net, route 21% \\* 4.5 = 94.5% of the solar energy hitting the collector area underground. This way, it helps to alleviate the urban heat island effect, as this is equivalent to a cool roof with 94.5% reflectivity. When this technology is deployed on a large scale, this should become noticeable.\n-   **Much higher collector efficiency.** Thermal solar collectors have a module efficiency of ~34% (the [DLSC example](../The_Future_of_Ecological_Urban_Living.2020-01-18.1.odt/(https://www.dlsc.ca/reports/swc2017-0033-Mesquita.pdf#page=5))) while modern monocrystalline PV modules achieve \u201conly\u201d 22.8% ([source](https://www.nrel.gov/pv/module-efficiency.html)) \u2013 we assume 21% here for readily available modules. Heat pumps boost the PV module efficiency: to exceed a thermal solar efficiency of 34%, a heat pump would only need a coefficient of performance larger than 34% / 21% = 1.62. This is easily achievable. Using 25 \u00b0C indoor air as the source and 60 \u00b0C water as the output, the temperature difference is 35 \u00b0C, just as in the European standard test conditions for heat pumps. Under these conditions, heat pumps achieve a COP up to 4.5 ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_performance#Derivation)), nearly tripling (!) the effective collector efficiency compared to thermal solar collectors (note :speech\\_balloon:).\n-   With a COP of 4.5, the PV / heat pump combination makes for an effective thermal module efficiency of 21% \\* 4.5 = 94.5%. Well irradiated outdoor space is often the limiting factor in cities, so being able to install 94.5% / 34% = 2.8 times more solar heating capacity than with thermal solar panels is a major improvement.\n-   **Better cold-weather performance.** Due to their limited thermal insulation, flat-panel thermal solar collectors have a bad efficiency in cold weather. Evacuated tube collectors perform much better here, but are also much more expensive and need more surface area for the same nominal (summertime) heat output. [Evacuated flat plate collectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_thermal_collector#Evacuated_flat_plate_collectors) combine the best of both worlds, but are also expensive and not yet readily available on the market.\n-   In contrast to that, photovoltaic modules have a *higher* efficiency in cold weather due to lower silicon temperatures. PV modules will easily be the most efficient collector in wintertime, as even evacuated flat panels will not achieve their 94.5% effective performance (as calculated above) in full sun. In overcast sky conditions, the advantage will be even higher because thermal collectors would not achieve the minimum temperature for space heating (30 \u00b0C) and thus have 0% effective performance, while PV panels with enough surface area can still power at least one heat pump. So to achieve a high direct solar contribution to heating in wintertime, this is clearly the best choice.\n\n**Water tanks as possible main storage.** Water tanks are an established option for small seasonal thermal energy storage plants ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_thermal_energy_storage#Small_buildings_with_internal_STES_water_tanks)). They require less pumping energy to charge and discharge, providing an even higher COP. Also, they make the heat faster accessible, while ground based storage needs water tanks as buffers because heat cannot be extracted as fast. However, they require space, which will not always be available in city buildings; and beyond a certain capacity the total costs of a tank system become larger than that of borehole thermal energy storage.\n\nNow when applying the heat-saving techniques from this document first (heated clothing, small heated spaces etc.), a building\u2019s heating requirements will already be 75%-90% lower. At that level, seasonal thermal energy storage with *only* water tanks could become the best option, both financially and space-wise.\n\n**Back-of-the-envelope calculation: water tank for a 20-person household.** Seasonal thermal storage is more efficient the larger it is, as the lower surface-to-volume ratio prevents excessive heat loss. So let\u2019s estimate the necessary size of a hot water tank for a 20 person household such as the future Reef:\n\n1.  **EU-28 heat needs per person.** Space heating plus water heating in all households in EU-28 Europe in 2017 was 7 635 790 TJ + 1 762 499 TJ = 9.398289 EJ ([source](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/9/93/Energy_consumption_households_data2017-mod.xlsx), [via](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Energy_consumption_in_households))\n\n    Europe had ca. 511 million people in 2017 ([source](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Population_and_population_change_statistics)). This means 5109 kWh/(person \\* year) ([calculation](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%289.398288+EJ%2F511000000%29+to+kWh)). Since this is an average for all of Europe, it will apply pretty well to the heat needs in a central European location.\n\n2.  **Stored heat needs per person.** The [example from DLSC](https://www.dlsc.ca/reports/swc2017-0033-Mesquita.pdf#page=9) shows that direct solar irradiation can be used to cover about half of household heat consumption over the course of a year, so the storage should be for about 60% of the year\u2019s total heat requirements: 5109 kWh/(person \\* year) \\* 0.6 = 3065 kWh/(person \\* year)\n3.  **Tank volume per person.** Water has a heat capacity of 4180 J/(kg\\*K) and the usable temperature difference is at most 65 K (30 \u00b0C floor heating water to 95 \u00b0C initial storage temperature). So to store 3065 kWh/person for the heating season, this would require 37.7 m\u00b3 of water per person ([source](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283065+kWh+%2F+%2870+K+*+4180+J%2F%28kg*K%29%29%29+to+kg&assumption=%22UnitClash%22+-%3E+%7B%22kg%22%2C+%7B%22Kilograms%22%7D%7D&assumption=%22UnitClash%22+-%3E+%7B%22J%2F%28kg*K%29%22%2C+%7B%22JoulesPerKilogramKelvinDifference%22%7D%7D&assumption=%22UnitClash%22+-%3E+%7B%22K%22%2C+%7B%22KelvinsDifference%22%7D%7D)).\n4.  **Applying efficiency.** Assuming that 80% of heating needs can be saved with energy conservation measures including other techniques from this document, this is reduced to 37.7 m\u00b3 \\* 0.2 = 7.54 m\u00b3 to store 3065 kWh/person \\* 0.2 = 613 kWh/person.\n5.  **Storage sizing for 20 people.** For a 20-person community household, this results in a total required storage volume of 7.54 m\u00b3 \\* 20 = 151 m\u00b3 to store 613 kWh \\* 20 = 12 260 kWh.\n6.  **Tank measures.** An interesting architectural option is a used stainless steel storage tank from the chemical industry placed centrally in a building. Structurally it would rest on the ground and be insulated all around to prevent excessive heat losses. Heat leaks in summer would be offset by the heat pumps providing cooling, and in winter they would contribute to space heating, improving the charge / discharge efficiency. In a four-storey building with an undivided upper storey and 2.30 m \u201ceconomical\u201d storey height, 6 m tank height plus insulation should fit into three storeys (confirmed below, as 40 cm insulation is needed). Assuming a simple cylindrical form, a 151 m\u00b3 tank of 6 m height will then be 5.66 m in diameter ([source](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=diameter+of+a+cylinder+with+151+m\u00b3+volume+and+6+m+height)).\n7.  **Insulation thickness.** 20% seems a good guess for base load heating that never has to be turned down during the heating season. In other words, 20% natural heat loss through the insulation during the heating season is acceptable, which amounts to 12 260 kWh \\* 0.2 = 2452 kWh. We have a 6 month = 180 day heating season and [157 m\u00b2 tank surface](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=surface+of+a+cylinder+with+5.66+m+diameter+and+6+m+height). This allows an average heat flow of 2452 kWh / (180 d \\* 24 h/d \\* 157 m\u00b2) = 3.62 W/m\u00b2. With a (95 \u00b0C + 30 \u00b0C) / 2 = 62.5 \u00b0C average tank temperature, the temperature difference to a 14.5 \u00b0C indoor temperature is 62.5 \u00b0C - 14.5 \u00b0C = 48 \u00b0C. Styrofoam insulation has a thermal resistance of 0.03 W/(m\\*K). To limit heat flow to 3.62 W/m\u00b2, it would have to be 40 cm strong ([formula](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/conductive-heat-transfer-d_428.html), [calculation](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+m\u00b2+*+48+\u00b0C+*+0.03+W%2F%28m*K%29+%2F+3.62+W&assumption=%22UnitClash%22+-%3E+%7B%22m%5E2%22%2C+%7B%22SquareMeters%22%7D%7D&assumption=%22UnitClash%22+-%3E+%7B%22\u00b0C%22%2C+%7B%22DegreesCelsiusDifference%22%7D%7D)).\n8.  **Lost floor area.** A tank of 5.66 m + 2 \\* 40 cm = 6.46 m diameter means that a floor area of pi \\* (6.46 m / 2)\u00b2 = 32.8 m\u00b2 is lost per storey, or 3 \\* 32.8 m\u00b2 = 98.3 m\u00b2 over the tanks three-storey height. Assuming a \u201ccompact but reasonable\u201d 25 m\u00b2 per person (between a 13 m\u00b3 legal minimum and the current 42.5 m\u00b2 EU-28 average), a 20 people household would have 500 m\u00b2 net, or 500 m\u00b2 + 98.3 m\u00b2 = ~600m\u00b2 gross floor area including the water tank. So 16.4% of floor area is lost to the water tank, which is considerable but doable.\n9.  **Necessary PV area.** To collect the tank\u2019s total 12 260 kWh stored usable heat with a system efficiency (incl. charging pumps) of 21% \\* COP 3.5 = 73.5% in 6 months non-heating season in May to October in Munich (where 65.4% of the total PV production occurs, of a total of 947 kWh / kWp \u2013 [source](https://www.rechnerphotovoltaik.de/photovoltaik/voraussetzungen/sonneneinstrahlung)), the required collector area is just about 27 m\u00b2 ([calculation](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2812260+kWh+%2F+%28%28947+kWh+%2F+kW+*+0.654+*+%281+kW%2Fm\u00b2+*+0.735%29%29%29%29+to+m\u00b2)).\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-43\"></span>Heating with compost\n\nComposting produces low-grade heat, but in both household and industrial composting, this heat is not used for anything. It can however be used to heat a whole house, as shown below. For a good overview of all published material about compost heat extraction, see: \u201c[Heat Recovery from composting: A Comprehensive Review of System Design, Recovery Rate, and Utilization](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1065657X.2016.1233082)\u201d.\n\nThe compost produced from kitchen scraps of urban inhabitants will not be enough to provide all the heat required for space heating, but collecting organic trash for free around the neighborhood is easily possible. Heat extraction from composting is similar to partially burning the biomass. Usually, the amount of heat recoverable depends heavily on the scale on the system:\n\nOn an energy-per-weight basis, energy recovery rates were 1159 kJ/kg DM \\[dry mass\\] (s = 602 kJ/kg DM) for lab-scale systems, 4302 kJ/kg DM (s = 2003 kJ/kg) for pilot-scale systems, and 7084 kJ/kg DM (s = 3272 kJ/kg DM) for commercial-scale systems. ([source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1065657X.2016.1233082#page=11), p. 11)\n\nThis is due to much lower surface-to-volume ratios in large-scale systems, avoiding heat loss to the environment. In the system below, all heat loss to the environment contributes to space heating because the compost heat is placed inside the house, so we can assume the 7084 kJ/kg dry mass heating value of compost. In a highly energy efficient community of 20 people, a total of 12 260 kWh is required for space heating. This would be contained in 12 260 kWh / 7084 kJ/kg = 6230 kg of compostable biomass on a dry mass basis, resulting in 6-10 m\u00b3 of humus produced per year. The compost vessel size should be large enough to store as much finished humus as can be loaded on a typical tipper truck or trailer for transportation to farms.\n\nThere are several advantages over burning biomass: (1) no need for drying the biomass before burning; (2) all biomass can be composted, whereas biomass burners are always specialized for one sort of fuel only; (3) there is no particulate air pollution in contrast to burning wood, and this is an important point in cities; (4) the end product is humus, a valuable agricultural input, and its accumulation in soil is a way of carbon sequestration. In contrast, the complete burning of biomass is at best carbon neutral.\n\nIn addition, there are advantages over the current practice of municipal collection of organic trash and centralized composting: (1) the heat is used for space heating instead of being lost; (2) the humus end product is significantly lighter and more compact than the initial biomass (incl. branches, leaves etc.), which should make its transportation to farms about 3 times more energy efficient (a guesstimate, so far); (3) the neighborhood-scale collection can be done manually because the weight, volume and distances are small, and this decarbonizes this part of the collection logistics.\n\nAn initial proposal for a system would be to place a 2-2.5 m diameter stainless steel tank vertically into the center of the house, containing the composting biomass. The tank can for example be obtained second hand as a 20 ft tank container. The biomass would be filled in at the top and extracted after 2-3 years at the bottom. Different from all systems outside of buildings, here 100% of the composting heat will eventually be used for space heating as it seeps through the walls into the building. The tank would be insulated enough to prevent excessive heat loss or heating up the surrounding rooms too much, and if necessary a heat exchange loop of copper tube might be routed between the tank and insulation and route captured heat into a hot-water tank for distribution to other parts of the building. Some other equipment will also be necessary: forced ventilation with compressed air from below; a heat exchanger in the hot steamy compost fumes; and an extraction screw, ideally pouring the compost right on a truck parked aside the building.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-44\"></span>Wastewater heat recovery\n\nHeat from all wastewater should be extracted using passive cooling and, in a second stage, an electrical heat pump, before finally discharging the wastewater. There will be an optimum temperature for discharging the wastewater, namely the temperature where heat can be just as efficiently extracted with the heat pump from outdoor air or (better) the ground. Ground temperature is ca. 12 \u00b0C year-round, so that would be the temperature to discharge wastewater at. Or probably a bit lower (9-10 \u00b0C) as heat extracting from water at surface level does not need as much pumping energy as extracting it from a 30-80 m deep borehole. The average wastewater temperature can be determined based on hot and cold water volumes in a household, and from that the recoverable energy can be determined.\n\nSeveral engineering and DIY approaches for greywater heat recovery exist:\n\n-   \u201c[Greywater Heat Exchanger in A Barrel Progress](https://builditsolar.com/Experimental/GreyWaterHX/gwinbarrel.htm)\u201d\n-   \u201c[Design and Analysis of a Residential Greywater Heat Recovery System](https://builditsolar.com/Experimental/GreyWaterHX/Canmet%20GreywaterHeatRecoverySystem.pdf)\u201d\n\n## <span id=\"anchor-45\"></span>Cooling\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-46\"></span>Wearable air conditioning\n\nWearable air conditioning devices are slowly appearing on the market, and there are good reasons for this technology:\n\n> \"The thought process was and is that if you increase the set point of your thermostat to something slightly warmer than comfortable, and then use this for supplemental cooling, there will be a huge energy savings \\[\u2026\\] The company claims that, because \\[\u2026\\] \\[the device\\] would allow people to cool themselves rather than their entire office or home, it could translate to energy savings of between 15% and 35% of a building\u2019s overall cooling costs.\"\n\n> (source: \"[The billion-dollar race to invent a wearable air conditioner](https://www.fastcompany.com/90385897)\")\n\nHowever, devices for use inside buildings can be different: cheaper and more efficient because they do not have to rely on battery power. here is a proposal: a 4 - 5 l insulated water bladder with very cold water (-10 \u00b0C by using salt water) and a heat exchanger with a small battery operated pump that circulates 20 \u00b0C water through the clothing. One would wear light, long, insulating clothing, for example down clothing. When the heat buffer is exhausted after 1-4 hours (depending on inside temperature), one would go to a recharge station an plug in a hose. The warm water will then be sucked out of the water bladder, and new cold water will be filled in. This will happen within 10-20 seconds, so it is not uncomfortable at all. The recharge station can be built from a normal deep freezer by creating a hole with hose connector in the door and adding a two-way pump to that. There would be one large liquid tank of about 100 l in the freezer, and water will be pumped in and out of that same tank. This way, only one hose and one tank vessel is needed. The freezer can still be use for food storage outside of summertime.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-47\"></span>Small cooled spaces\n\nSimilar to small heated spaces, but to replace air conditioning rather than heating. There is absolutely no reason to air condition a whole house. Ideas for small cooled spaces:\n\n-   **Cooled bed.** The blanket would include a silicone hose with circulating cold water at the bottom. The blanket would be heavily insulated, to keep the heat out.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-48\"></span>Thermal mass air conditioning\n\nA simple and energy efficient way of keeping the inside of urban houses cool during the day is using water as a thermal mass for buffering the heat, dissipating it during the night again. Water is amazing because it has a specific heat capacity at STP of 4.18 J/(g K). Compare that with [0.74 J/(g K)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=specific+heat+capacity+of+concrete) for concrete or [0.39 J/(g K)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=specific+heat+capacity+of+wood) for wood (and probably the average for interior objects of a house). So a relatively small amount of water can increase the thermal buffer of a house considerably.\n\nWhere this is not sufficient, heat pumps can be used as a supporting measure: 25 \u00b0C warm water as a heat sink still allows a heat pump to operate more efficiently than 40 \u00b0C outside air ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_performance#Improving_COP)). This system is the same technique as used for seasonal thermal energy storage, just applied to cooling. It needs a different reservoir (water or ground boreholes) though as the goal is different.\n\nThere is no need for seasonal storage here, though. Instead, the water will simply be cooled down during the night again, perhaps with enough buffer for up to warm nights where cooling is difficult. A highly efficient way of cooling is to let the water run down inclined rooftops in a circular pumped loop system, providing [radiative cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling) to the night sky, plus some evaporative cooling. This can be enhanced by covering the roof with polymers that have a high emissivity in the athmospheric IR radiation window. Luckily, such polymers area available commercially as film material from 3M, as used in [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5115392/). There is no need to apply a silver coating as done in that study, as the cooling will be only done during the night. However, applying that cooling provides a \u201csupercool\u201d roof during daytime, cooling to sub-ambient temperatures by itself even under direct sunlight.\n\nPractically, one could just use water in containers inside the house or in a cistern next to the house instead of active air conditioning. As long as the air temperature during the night is comfortable and the amount of water is sufficient, there will be no need for air conditioning. The only energy needed is for a fan to move the heat in and out of the water, and to distribute the cold air in the house. This can also be used to retrofit existing houses, even rented flats. Simply place lots of 20 l water cans in the flat, but distributed so that the floor is not strained too much. And then use a fan running during the night to cool down the room and the water in it as much as possible again.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-49\"></span>Cool and supercool roofs and walls\n\nSurfaces that both reflect incoming sunlight and also cool by emitting IR radiation, preferably in the atmospheric window, keep relatively cool under direct sunlight and can even cool to subambient temperatures (see: [overview of recent research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling#Architecture)). One of the most promising materials for mass production is just a commercial dual-polymer film material coated with silver sputtering on its back ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5115392/)).\n\nApplying existing paints and materials and also the new materials in architecture can provide better energy efficiency and comfort in summer:\n\n> Cool roofing limits total cooling loads in summer, reduces the severity of the urban heat island (UHI) problem in towns and cities, and helps eliminate peak power demand problems from operation of many air conditioners. Added feedback benefits from cool roofs \\[\u2026\\] include ventilation with cooler air and higher performance of adjacent chillers when in cooler air. ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5115392/))\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-50\"></span>Reverse chimney effect cooling\n\nThis is a largely unknown principle for passive cooling of buildings, observed and developed by Buckminster Fuller with his geodesic domes. Air is drawn into the top of a dome and exits through side vents at the bottom, driven by convection of air heated by the sun. The air drawn in cools down for some poorly understood reason (Venturi effect, or conservation of energy; see [carburetor icing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carburetor_icing)). For the best compilation of sources about this phenomenon, see: \u201c[Buckminster Fuller\u2019s Chilling Domes: the physics](http://www.stuartmcmillen.com/blog/chilling-domes-physics/)\u201d.\n\nThis technique could be used in urban architecture, either for the main house, or for a naturally cool space in the garden or on the rooftop.\n\n## <span id=\"anchor-51\"></span>Electricity\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-52\"></span>Flexible electricity demand\n\nEven before this is used as a feature in the national grid, you can \u201chelp the grid\u201d by consuming electricity only when renewable energy production is high and demand is low. If everyone does this, it avoids the need for most energy storage, currently the biggest challenge of integrating renewable energy into the grid.\n\nExamples include:\n\n-   Cook with electricity when renewables production is high, otherwise cook with biogas and hydrogen. This also applies to the water kettle \u2013 instead of an electric kettle, develop and use a dedicated gas-powered water kettle.\n-   Use a circuit that starts the washing machine and dishwasher when a delay, triggered when renewables production is high.\n-   Have enough clean clothing so that using the washing machine only becomes necessary every 2-4 weeks. That should be enough buffer to catch times of high renewables production. You basically store energy in clean clothes.\n-   Use fridges and deep freezers with cold storage and an extreme amount of insulation. Such devices are already made for campervans. They store energy non-electrically in cold and can stay off for 12 hours or more while renewables production is low.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-53\"></span>Low-voltage DC installation\n\n**Disadvantages of current grid-tied PV.** Currently, nearly all houses with a photovoltaics (PV) plant convert low-voltage DC from the PV panels to 230 V AC via grid-tied inverters, and then partially consume that electricity internally while feeding the rest into the grid. Compared to a low-voltage DC system, this makes PV energy more expensive because (1) working with 230 V AC electricity is potentially unsafe so most people will not do much of that in a DIY manner, (2) at least some work with grid electricity is usually reserved for \u201ccertified professionals\u201d who will regularly demand payment for their work, (3) the inverter itself costs money and is often the first device to fail in a PV installation while PV panels have an estimated lifetime of 25 years, (4) the inverter also incurs conversion losses, (5) many modern electrical consumers like electronics and LED lighting are internally DC devices, so there are additional conversion losses for converting AC electricity back to DC.\n\nCompared to that, a DC electricity PV setup that is not tied to the grid makes a lot of sense. By following the [SELV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-low_voltage#Separated_or_safety_extra-low_voltage_(SELV)) standard for its construction, there is no danger of electrocution at all, making DIY work on this system safe. Ideally it will use no or very little battery storage because batteries degrade over time and make electricity more expensive and less ecologically sustainable (though also compare section \u201cFree battery storage\u201d). Instead, as much of the locally produced electricity would be used up immediately by doing useful work that is somewhat flexible in time (see section \u201cStoring solar energy in useful work\u201d).\n\n**Two wiring systems.** In effect, a house would then have two electrical systems: the normal 230 V AC grid for high-power devices and the SELV DC system for low-power DC devices. The DC system should probably use 24 V DC because that has lower line losses than 12 V DC and is still a voltage where devices are commercially available easily because trucks use 24 V DC. While the house does not produce power for the DC system, a AC-DC converter will provide that from the grid.\n\n**Self-consumption with AC devices.** There is also a way to use locally produced PV electricity for AC consumers, with automatic switchover to the grid when not enough locally produced electricity is available. For that, see \u201c[A much better solution for solar self-consumption](https://edgeryders.eu/t/9030)\u201d. This works with a much simpler and cheaper type of inverter that is not applicable for grid-tied operation, but is primarily a cost-optimization strategy than an ecological intervention. It is however a solution that makes PV electricity attractive in areas where feed-in to the grid is forbidden.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-54\"></span>Storing solar energy in useful work\n\nIn urban areas, the only renewable energy sources that are readily accessible are ground heat and air heat (via heat pumps) and solar irradiation (via thermal or photovoltaics collectors and via photosynthesis). So of course, everything would be covered with photovoltaics cells to capture as much electricity from winter sunlight as possible. Wind energy is not accessible in significant amounts (low height, only vertical wind turbines possible etc.). Using ground heat and air heat requires electricity or mechanical movement to run heat pumps, so is basically just a way to amplify / leverage that energy. And that energy must come from the sun, the only other renewable energy source. So the principle of an energy self-sufficient building in the higher latitudes (with pronounced seasons) must be to store solar energy in various ways during the summer for use in winter.\n\nSince batteries are expensive storage technology, they are not practical for seasonal energy storage. For this reason, an array of other technologies would have to be developed to store solar energy in a form closer to its usage. For example, energy can be stored as:\n\n-   **Heat for cooking. **Since cooking is the largest use of energy in a typical summer day in a house, it is the best candidate for using up excess photovoltaics electricity. This would be done by buffering the energy as heat, to prevent the cost and complexity of battery storage. In practice, excess PV energy would be used in DC form to heat up fireclay blocks with embedded nicro wire spirals, up to about 900 \u00b0C. The fireclay stones would be stored in a compact insulated container vertically below the kitchen stove. To extract the heat for cooking, cold air will be blown into air gaps in this block of fireclay, and the emerging hot air will be routed through insulated tubes to the kitchen stove's pots. As the air temperature decreases, the system will increase the air volume to compensate. When that method reaches its limit, a gas flame will be burned inside of this air to heat it up further. Preferably, biogas would be used for this. Cooking with gas that is burning in hot air will still save fuel compared to a normal gas stove.\n-   **Drying capacity.** Basically, by drying calcium chloride to its anhydrous form when energy is available in excess.\n-   **Cooling capacity.** Zeolites, as used in self-chilling beer kegs, can be used as non-electrical energy storage for a fridge.\n-   **Clean clothing.** With enough clothing, it is easily possible to wash and dry the clothing only in summer where excess photovoltaics power is available and where outdoor drying is easily possible.\n-   **Seasonal heat.** See the section about seasonal heat storage.\n-   **Cooking fuel.** Drying organic trash for use in an anaerobic digestion plant on demand, then cooking with that biogas.\n-   **Heating fuel.** Wood and other burnable biomass is basically stored solar energy. Its energy content can be raised considerably by drying it, which is a good use of excess solar energy.\n-   **Fuel for generating electricity.** Hydrogen in low-pressure storage vessels; dried organic trash for use in an anaerobic digestion plant, producing biogas; both used in internal combustion engines of the linear alternator type.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-55\"></span>Free battery storage\n\nIn a renewables-powered future, there can never be enough storage for electricity. Here is a way how a small group of people can create a major amount of battery storage for basically free, and even derive financial benefit from it. The benefit comes from the fact that locally produced renewable electricity from free salvaged battery cells is three times cheaper than selling the electricity to the grid and buying it back when needing it later (Germany, 2019). It also is a pioneering effort for the time when grids will buy electricity from distributed storage like electric vehicles at higher prices than they buy renewable electricity at the time of production now.\n\nHere is how to make this happen: In 2015, about 2.4 billion 18650 cells were produced, of which 1.8 billion were used in consumer devices etc. and 600 million by Tesla. These 1.8 billion are a stable yearly demand since 2010 ([source](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/types_of_battery_cells)). Given the typical lifetime of these cells of less than 5 years (300-500 cycles in consumer devices), this means they are replaced, not added. As these cells are not recycled, 1.8 billion cells are available every year for free. With a remaining average capacity of (say) 2 Wh (~20%) per cell, that means 3.6 billion Wh = 3600 MWh = 3.6 million kWh of storage capacity can be added every year. In 10 kWh units per household, this is enough for 360,000 \u201cfree\u201d household-sized backup power plants per year.\n\nThese backup plants would be built as follows:\n\nThere would be a fireproof charging and discharging station where enough cells can be charged and discharged at a time to cover 80% of the households electricity needs. High demands (\u201ccooking at night with electricity\u201d) will be excluded and covered form the grid instead. By being fireproof and ejecting burning battery cells into a fireproof chamber, even \u201cunsafe\u201d undervoltage lithium-ion cells can be re-used safely.\n\nIn addition to the charging and discharging station, there would be large storage boxes where the batteries are stored in bulk. Each cell would be protected with a plastic casing so that the cell holders in the charging / discharging station can reach the terminals but so that the cells in loose bulk can never create a short circuit, because short-circuiting unprotected lithium-ion cells can lead to fires.\n\nA mechatronic system would then be able to remove cells from the charging / discharging station and replace them with other cells. A proposal would be a large wall of battery cells, facing with their negative terminals to a cartesian robot that can extract and insert them one by one. The movement to insert a cell would consists of pushing it in, rotating it by 30\u00b0 to lock a bayonet style lock, and releasing it, which results in spring pressure on the positive terminal securing the bayonet lock. The bayonet locking points would also serve as the negative terminal, which is possible by removing some of the plastic insulation from the cell\u2019s metal container. Because the whole container is the cell\u2019s negative terminal, with the exception of the one end serving as the positive terminal.\n\nThat way, electricity can be stored in pallet sized boxes. A 1 m\u00b3 pallet with loose bulk 18650 cells at 25% cell volume to total volume ratio and 2 Wh remaining capacity per cell could store roughly 30 kWh of electrical energy, enough for 4 complete days in an optimized communal household with 20 people.\n\nThere is no good reason to make an urban household off-grid, so there is no minimum required amount of battery storage. Every amount provides additional financial benefit, so the commune would simply collect and prepare as many battery cells as they can find.\n\nPreparing the battery cells just means breaking open the batteries of notebooks, cordless powertools, electric bicycles and the like, harvesting the cells and placing them individually into protective plastic containers that also have a barcode on their side. The mechatronic system uses this barcode to automatically register the cell and then stores all relevant information about it: testing results, current carrying capacity, current charge state, performance degradation over time and finally that the cell died and has been removed from the system. This also allows to store cells with mixed charge states, mixed capacities and mixed current carrying capacity in the same container, as the charging / discharging station can identify and treat each cell individually.\n\nA similar system can be created for the rather arbitrarily shaped lithium-polymer battery cells from smartphones, notebook computers etc.. They would be placed into standard sized protective containers which then allow loose bulk storage and handling with an automated mechatronic system.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-56\"></span>Photovoltaic modules as wall covering\n\nTo make an old (or even new) facade weatherproof, used photovoltaic modules are an attractive option. It's weatherproofing for decades without deterioration, also generates some power, and these modules are available for 0.25 EUR/W<sub>p</sub> used, which equates to 30% of the new price. For the permanently shaded portions of walls, it makes sense to use broken PV panels (as long as the glass is undamaged) as this provides a visually consistent and equally weatherproof wall surface.\n\n## <span id=\"anchor-57\"></span>Water\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-58\"></span>Drinking tap water\n\nIt would be interesting to calculate the emission savings when drinking only tap water based beverages, compared to other options (milk, fruit juices, bottled water). Savings will come from transportation fuel savings (which are considerable as beverages are heavy), reduction of dairy agriculture (which saves methane emissions etc.), savings from glass and plastic bottle manufacturing. Transportation through the public water pipeline is just so much more energy efficient. Also, if really desired, fruit juices should be purchased as concentrate and mixed into juices at home.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-59\"></span>Water efficient hygiene\n\nA lot about hygiene is not a public health issue but a psychological issue. Human psychological issues are not a proper reason to destroy the environment, so it\u2019s time to rethink hygiene.\n\n-   **Private bathrooms.** Bathroom hygiene is mostly a psychological issue \u2013 a communal bathroom has to look and smell clean as dirt and smells are a biologically ingrained cue for pathogens. However, not all dirt contains pathogens. A way to decrease the actual and perceived need for bathroom hygiene is to give everyone a private bathroom \u2013 one simply cannot infect oneself with own germs as one will either be infected or immune already. In addition, private bathrooms are the simplest way to prevent transmission of (gastrointestinal) diseases. Everyone would also clean their own bathroom, of course, removing the typical friction around this topic in communal living setups.\n-   **How to shower less often.** Everyone tells people to \"take shorter showers\" in order to reduce their GHG emissions, but nobody dares to say: you don't need to shower that often. That's a cultural taboo, and we can't afford taboos anymore because this is a global ecological crisis. For example, telework is a way to avoid excessive need for showering.\n-   **Recirculating showers.**\n-   **Composting dry toilets.**\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-60\"></span>Rainwater capture and infiltration\n\nRelevant literature:\n\n-   [**To Catch the Rain**](http://www.tocatchtherain.org/)**.** About rainwater harvesting. The book is open content but you need to enter your email address to [get it](http://www.tocatchtherain.org/get-it-free/).\n-   [**Prospects for Managed Underground Storage of Recoverable Water**](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12057)**.** 2008. 350 pages. Very interesting discussion of how to store excess water in groundwater, by infiltration with basins, trenches and wells. Quite high-level and not containing instructions directly, but instructions can be derived from this after study.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-61\"></span>Wastewater evaporation\n\nRunoff water and even lightly contaminated greywater is usually not suitable for groundwater infiltration, and infiltration of pure rainwater also makes no sense if your city has extensive systems in place to drain groundwater away as fast as possible.\n\nIn these cases, evaporating that water is another meaningful way to use. Water vapor carries away a lot of sensible heat, so if applied in a whole neighborhood, evaporating large amounts of collected water during the summer will probably reduce outdoor temperatures. Just take care to not install any dark surfaces in order to support water evaporation \u2013 if the intention is cooling, this is self-defeating as it only contributes to the urban heat island effect.\n\nAs a side benefit, evaporating the resulting greywater allows you to legally use collected rainwater for free, that is, without having to pay wastewater fees for it. When applied on a large scale and in tandem with careful water conservation, wastewater grading and filtration at the point of consumption, it should even be possible to avoid 90-95% of wastewater making it to the sewage system at all. This is not a major challenge in European cities, but in developing cities it may be a way to deal with the overchallenged or non-existing sewage system. A public sewage system might not be needed at all, as the remaining wastewater can be collected with pumping vehicles.\n\n## <span id=\"anchor-62\"></span>Transportation\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-63\"></span>Public transport hacks \n\n**Foam pads for comfort and warmth.** Until public transport starts offering extra cushions for the knees of very tall people, or the backs of somewhat delicate riders - just bring your own. It does not have to be an overpriced outdoor pillow. A folded piece of down-cycled yoga mat, or sleeping pad will do fine. Store it directly against your back in a rucksack for improved carrying comfort, or better protect a notebook\u2019s bottom edge, with minimal weight or volume issues. Now you can also work far more comfortably at that coffee place or in the park and pick your favorite place without getting cold too quick. As another side effect, this kind of clothing system might find its first entry into the market as outdoor clothing for professionals working in cold weather regularly.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-64\"></span>Safe and comfortable bicycling\n\nThe bicycle is one of the most efficient means of transportation known to mankind, but its adoption is far beyond potential in urban centers due to cultural and psychological biases related to comfort and safety. Making bicycling in cities both safe and comfortable is partially a political problem, but until that gets covered, there is a lot that individuals and groups can do as well:\n\n-   Automatic [door closers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_closer) should be [adjusted for bikes](https://youtu.be/aRxzm0GAz8c?t=23) and kids.\n-   Shared bike locks (Bluetooth codes) - share with friends, social cohesion\n-   E-bikes and commutes (event week / month + incentives to curb apparent extremism), e-scooters charging and energy awareness Better practices and less prejudice concerning remote work\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-65\"></span>Electric velomobiles\n\nThis is ultimate in personal low-cost mobility. A bicycle is comfortable to use within about 30 km (or two hours one way, whichever is lower) of a home location, and uncomfortable beyond that, esp. due to the seating position, missing protection from rain etc.. A velomobile with permanent or retractable enclosure, four wheels, space for baggage and a strong battery and motor however would allow multi-day tours of 1000 km and beyond. This allows the commune to have sustainable DIY mobility, without having to earn and pay money for bus tickets etc..\n\nIn contract to a normal bicycle which is optimized for low cost, simplicity and durability, this velomobile would be optimized for comfortable and sustainable traveling. This is also a complex and relatively expensive devices, so a commune would only have about two, each for one person plus baggage. One is not enough, as on longer tours there should be two for mutual support / redundancy. Also, people often like to travel together.\n\nIdeas for design and construction:\n\n-   Both two-wheel and four-wheel velomobiles have their advantages. In any case, the velomobile must be narrow enough to use a single-track foot trail, as that allows a lot of backcountry use, and to avoid using streets with motorized vehicles (as these are quite dangerous). Probably, 60 cm left to right wheel distance is the maximum for single-track usage.\n-   For use in the wider local area, combining the velomobile with a self-developed battery swapping standard is a good way to lower the weight and increase the average speed. Finding locations for the battery swap stations is simple: offer private households to set up a small photovoltaics installation that lowers their electricity bill if they agree that a portion (as much as needed) of the electricity is used to charge the batteries, and that people with the velomobile can come and swap batteries at any time (by accessing a locked box where the battery is charging).\n-   The velomobile would be able to drive without pedaling, but the speed will be limited to 30-35 km/h to limit air resistance (which increases quadratically) but also for safety reasons.\n-   When using a two-wheeled velomobile, a shape like the BMW C1 motorcycle would be both comfortable and protecting. There would be pedals, but unlike in a bicycle one would sit on a flat, cushioned surface. Also one would be able to choose to pedal (towards the front) or not (resting the feet away from the pedals, like with a motorscooter).\n-   For long-distance use, the velomobile should have a trailer of photovoltaics panels. It would be able to telescope in length while driving on an empty road, to extend the catchment area. And one of the best ways to harvest energy will be to rest for 2-4 hours at noon, letting the sun fill the batteries. Cycling at noon in direct sun is not much fun anyway.\n\n### <span id=\"anchor-66\"></span>Hospitality\n\n**Intra-city hospitality networks.** These networks would allow to stay over at or near a place one visited in a different part of the city. Unlike AirBnB and similar, this system would work without monetary compensation \u2013 instead, it is in exchange for hosting other people at ones own place.\n\nBenefits include:\n\n-   Not having to use GHG-inefficient transport modes, which are often the only ones available late at night: cabs and night buses.\n-   Time savings when one has to visit the same place or a place in the same part of the city again the next day.\n-   Extending the capacity of a communal home for guests by temporarily moving out for a few days.\n\n**Resource-efficient hosting.** The current hospitality industry is certainly not the most climate-friendly way to accommodate temporary inhabitants of a city. Rather, hosting friends etc. in a multi-use space inside ones own house will be much more efficient.", "created_at": "2019-12-03 19:48:33.760731", "updated_at": "2020-01-21 00:55:39.857766", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 27502, "wiki": false, "reads": 35, "score": 307.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 5252, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62159, "user_id": 5400, "topic_id": 10740, "post_number": 30, "raw": "I'll be driving with bad internet connection..

I really hope there are enough outspoken tech-libertarian and crypto-anarchist users of the early Internet left, who will not fall for regulation as a solution. As we have just recently seen in [the lost fight against upload filters in the EU](/t/9649), regulators have an unsatiable appetite to churn out more regulation, in favour of whoever lobbies them around, once they discover another domain that is responsive to regulation. Innovative cryptocurrency and blockchain projects are doomed as well once governments discover ways to regulate there. (That space is admittedly a bloody Wild West scenario right now, but why not. At least it's innovative!)\n\n\n### Too big to exist\n\nSo if regulation can not save but only destroy the Internet we loved, what then? In very short: everything that is large enough to cause serious social issues (like, well, Facebook in this case) should either (1) not exist at all or (2) be public infrastructure, preferably distributed and open source, and certainly not in private hands or (3) consist of small federated units so it cannot cause such serious problems.\n\n\n### The case against advertising\n\nAnd while we are at it: most issues with tech giants somehow revolve around the use and abuse of advertising. Both in the case of Facebook and Brexit, and in the conflict between publishers and Google over the share of Internet advertisement revenue (which is behind the whole upload filter and link tax debate of the EU copyright reform). Now advertisement is organized bullshitting and misleading of people anyway, and the Brexit campaign example makes the hypocrisy of political leaders blatantly obvious: in their eyes, organized bullshitting of people for economic growth is fine (even though overconsumption means ecological destruction, but who cares) but organized bullshitting of people for other causes is \"a threat to democracy\"!?\n\nSo if we want to save the Internet, and a good part of the natural world alongside, let's get rid of advertising altogether, both online, in print, on TV and in public space, whether for products or political parties. It will create some disruption, but the Internet will find other business models, no worries.

Its main effect is that people are waking up to the fact that the cowboy era of data hoarding is over. \"Data minimalism\" has become a thing (for example, it is a tenet of City of Amsterdam's digital strategy: a far cry from the alcyon days of the \"smart city\"). IT folks focus on the costs of compliance, but the bite of the GDPR is that it creates digital rights; puts the liability for infringing those rights on the entities that collect data; and then steps aside and lets the courts do their job.

Since this is really very coarse and will need a lot of tweaking, I am leaving it on a spreadsheet for the moment, rather than copying it onto a HTML table on the platform. Look at formulas to decode the numbers: I hypothesized a monthly full-time equivalent cost for each person, then hypothesized a committment (for example: 20% of time, i.e. one day\u00a0a week) and multiplied that percentage commitment by the FTE equivalent cost and by the number of months involved (for the core team I have 3.5 months, the whole duration of the project.

I am an economist, and I think your view of what economics is about is largely shaped by the views of the majority of economists who (as with most fields) have not deeply thought about what their field is about, and so have an excessively narrow view. This doesn't matter so much for many areas, but it matters a great deal in economics. \n\nEconomics is not at all about money -- actually money itself is useless. This is obvious -- you cannot eat it or live in it or drive it or play with it. Money is only valuable because it is possible to exchange it for things that are actually useful. Moreover, we often have a very limited idea of what those things are. The things we want are not just consumables or extras in the vast majority of cases: if you look at what people spend their money on, it is easy to see that housing is the largest item. Other large items are transportation, education, health care, clothing and food -- none of these are extras. In fact, if you look at what people want in any kind of clear way, it is obvious that these go back to the things that are mentioned in any first-year psychology course under the heading of Maslow's Pyramid of Needs. These begin with physiological needs such as housing and health care; on the second level are about security needs; on the third level revolve around the need for love and belonging; fourth level \"esteem\" or respect and self-respect; the fifth is creativity and self-expression. Whatever people want are some combination of these needs. For most people most of the time, their focus is on creating a \"nest\" of love and belonging which fulfills their need for companionship, creating and fostering children, and caring for loved ones.\n\nBy and large, the great majority of environmental problems around consumption are not associated with what people want, but with the industrial processes by which those products are produced. Since people are focused on their direct needs, they are less concerned with processes. Moreover, they want to use their available resources to obtain as much of their desired life as they can, so cost is a big factor, and this can drive processes.\n\nSo it seems to me there are several takeaways: one is to educate people to be more concerned with the ways in which the products they use affect the world around them and on  how they can push suppliers to make products in more environmentally friendly ways. This is starting but needs to progress a lot more, and schools are a great place for this to happen.  The second is to sensitize children from birth in love for nature. Unfortunately this is currently headed in the opposite direction, as we are increasingly isolated from nature in our technology and controlled indoor environments. Schools also need to help here, although families are the most important. And then from a more directly economics point of view, environmental costs of industrial processes need to be made part of the price of goods, so that price signals reflect actual costs. Rather than regulation it is better to tax environmental damages, so that companies can use the least costly means to reduce the damage they cost.\n\nSo there is a political component, but also a major educational component, and an underlying economic thrust to these measures.", "created_at": "2019-09-27 19:21:02.011498", "updated_at": "2019-09-27 19:21:02.011498", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 576, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 36.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57067, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10405, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Yes please.

The foundation's partners are the city hall and the university of Bologna; with its [Urban imagination office](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2019-03-07/bologna-the-city-with-a-civic-imagination-office/), and supported by a city hall who has [accepted the requests of Extinction Rebellion](https://elisabettaambrosi.com/ea/2019-10/anche-bologna-dichiara-emergenza-climatica-grazie-agli-extinction-rebellion), it represents the tip of the spear of advanced urban governance in Italy. \n\nMichele was one of the speakers in the panel organized by Edgeryders at the Creative Bureaucracy Festival in Berlin in September. We had the opportunity to catch up; he liked where Edgeryders seems to be going with EarthOS, and forewarned me that he would get in touch to discuss possible collaborations. \n\n### Areas for collaboration\n\nThey are working on:\n\n* **A \"proximity\" governance model**. The Foundation (with a staff of  20-25 people) assigned individual people to each neighborhood. Staffers spend most of their time in the hood, getting to know the local people and the very rich tissue of small NGOs and informal groups. This seems a great way to foster trust, and to govern a diverse, democratic society (for example, Bologna is the only European city with a strong movement against Airbnb.  \n* **Spaces**. They just acquired from Rete Ferrovie Italiane a 2,000 square meter hangar, formerly used for railway materiel. They are trying to develop a \"mixed\" model which is not residential+work+social, like our own Reef, but (precarious) work + sport and leisure + services. Their goal is to serve the 4,000 workers of the gig economy in Bologna, which are already a political subject in town (the riders are even unionized). A brilliant intuition by Michele and his team is the idea to talk to Unipol, Italy's cooperative insurance giant, to \"bundle\" social insurance and access to credit with the use of the space. I would like to bake this idea into The Reef!\n* **Urban greening**, as per Extinction Rebellion's goals.\n\nOf course, this is a super interesting and prestigious partnership for Edgeryders. Over the last seven years, Bologna has been very successful in attracting European money: 70 million EUR!\n\n**What they need is money for their projects**. We reckon we can get them from Horizon projects, Climate-KIC's funds and others. \n\n### Next steps\n\n1. Bologna plans to apply to a Horizon 2020 GOVERNANCE call (deadline: March 12 2020). They already applied to the same call last year; they did not win, but got a high scoring and were encouraged to re-apply. They propose we join the partnership, which includes Barcelona and others. Valeria (Foundation) is going to get in touch with us with the relevant information and the concept note (ping @marina).\n\n1. @ilaria to connect with Mauro (Foundation) on possible participation to C-KIC's own calls. This interaction should also figure out if Bologna is interested in The Reef as a model.\n\n1. @noemi, @chantal_vanoeteren, do you see a possibility to raise the profile of The Reef via a partnership with them?

Pitala me je drugarica koliko godina ima mlada. Moj odgovor je bio kao iz topa- par godina je mla\u0111a od mene, verovatno izme\u0111u 26 i 28 godina.. Muk sa druge strane slu\u0161alice. A onda smeh: \"Devojko, ti imas 36!\" Re\u010denica me udari u svestan deo mog mozga. Kad je pre pro\u0161lo, pitam se.\n\nRa\u010dunam, dok sam zavr\u0161ila \u0161kolu i fakultet, udala se, rodila pre 5 godina, sve je to ok... i nije mnogo, ponosim se svojim izborom. Tad proleti misao, 17 godina rada u dr\u017eavnoj slu\u017ebi, ta\u010dnije Po\u0161ti srbije! E to je mnogo! Jo\u0161 malo pa polovinu svog \u017eivota posvetih poslu, a ne sebi.\nTog leta htela sam samo da radim neki sezonski posao, da skupim pare izme\u0111u srednje i faxa. Al tata me zaposli u po\u0161ti. Toliko nisam verovala da \u0107u pro\u0107i razgovor za posao, da sam ve\u010de pre objave pobednika stavila masku od majoneza na kosu i preno\u0107ila sa njom. Ne moram da ka\u017eem da sam se prvi dan posla molila da mi se ne zalepi neka muva na \u0161i\u0161ke. I da sam bar tad shvatila da je to bio lo\u0161 znak ...\u0161to se nije zalepila...\n\nTokom mog \u017eivota sa roditeljima postojao je O\u010dev zakonik kome smo se svako jutro molili i prinosili \u017ertve. Jedna od njih je bila i ova. Jer, ko si ti da se buni\u0161 kad ti je sve dato u \u017eivotu! Imas dr\u017eavni posao, odmore, bolovanja, trudni\u010dko, porodiljsko, radi, zavr\u0161i fax, napredova\u0107e\u0161.\n\nPrvi deo svoje velelepne poslovne karijere vrisak u mom stomaku sam smirivala stvarima koje volim. Nastavila sam da radim predstave i glumim po amaterskim pozori\u0161tima, dok sam usput koristila odmore i po koje bolovanje. Hvala kosmosu \u0161to trudni\u010dko i porodiljsko nisam, jer bih do sad ve\u0107 bila sre\u0107no razvedena..ili osu\u0111ena udovica. \n\nTra\u017eila sam na\u010din da promenim posao, al uvek sam se vra\u0107ala mi\u0161ljenju svoje patrijarhalne porodice. Bila sam jedina drugarica koja ima svoje pare! Wooow, kakav uspeh! Dok su ostale putovale po \u0160panijama, Italijama , ja ba\u0161 tada nisam mogla. Bud\u017eet mi nije dozvoljavao. \n\nI udade se Jagoda nakon zavr\u0161enog faxa, mora sve po redu, al sa 28 i to nakon udaje svoje 5 godina mla\u0111e sestre. Istina da ba\u0161 i nije tako patrijarhalno ve\u0107e isplaniralo, al bitno da smo svi \u017eivi i zdravi. I naravno uhvatih zadnji voz! \n\nPostadoh i \u0161ef smene i to sa \u010dak 25 eura ve\u0107om platom! Znaci ulaganje u fax \u0107e mi se isplatiti za koju deceniju. Al ta sre\u0107a ne be\u0161e dugog veka.

Po\u0161to sam nau\u010dena da pravila i zakoni, kako u \u017eivotu tako i u poslu, moraju da se po\u0161tuju, nisam ni slutila da meni, koja pravilnike i dopise rada dr\u017eim u crnom ispod nokta, mo\u017ee da se prekine \u0161efovski ugovor zarad straha vi\u0161eg \u0161efa, Velikog \u0160trumpfa, da \u0107u sesti na njenu stolicu.\n\nI tako, pored svih blagodeti firme gore navedenih, zadobih i bonuse.

Then we develop codes for the threads that cover the content of the conversations taking place. Sometimes these codes are &ldquo;in-vivo&rdquo; reflections of the conversations (direct quotes from community members), sometimes they draw from established terms in the (academic) debates about Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Cloud Technologies and other Internet ABC&rsquo;s (for a detailed description of our coding see [our open codebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qERrVXNdwJL_GWsPYJy_makIcvIBmJhwDgP1-SiKgRg/edit?usp=sharing) or feel free to shoot us a message on the platform). To ensure the transparency and methodological rigour of our work, we keep detailed memos in which we explain the decisions we made, identify concerns, and define paths forward. We also have monthly calls in which we discuss difficulties, code-collapsing, and relevant developments in the world of tech and culture (of which we also keep a log in the codebook).\n\nOver the past few weeks the NGI Forward ethnography team has been focussing much of their attention on threads pertaining to issues on the internet, tech and the environment. Our work on these threads has brought up two key insights that will be useful to keep in mind as we develop our methods.\n\n\nFirst, the community interacting on these threads appear to largely represent experts in tech; meaning they either seem to be conducting research, developing software, platforms, applications, leading groups of innovators and designers, or engage in activism and journalism around tech issues. This is something to keep in mind both for community managers and ethnographers, as it means we are observing and coding insights based on expert knowledge, and we should tailor our pointed questions towards gaining a deeper understanding of emergent trends, policy, design and innovation. It means we can ask more detailed questions pushing for nuanced analyses of technology issues.\n\nInterestingly (and perhaps conversely), explorations of the relationship between the climate and the internet/tech appears to be in its infancy, and though we are working with a community of experts, there often seems to be a struggle to solidly define key terms and concepts. Despite expertise, or perhaps because of it, specificity in defining technologies and technological areas requiring increased research focus persists across stories, meaning that members find defining targeted and specific problems around these areas difficult as well. Additionally, community members find an underlying tension between acknowledging the ecological costs of the tech industry and findings ways to develop technological tools to protect the climate. These two points characterise a vagueness, reluctance and caution on the part of the ER community when it comes to making bold or definitive claims about tech and the climate, which may explain why codes thus far are more topical (sketching the broad areas that community members have been interested in discussing) than analytical or solutions-focussed. We don't necessarily see this as an issue, but instead something to track and pay attention to moving forward, as it may indicate a larger phenomenon in this area.\n\n**![|624x295](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eAZTPL0PAXhx0vRCEUJqdH3sT-LkP-2MsctTFL6sV-gKA9PerAKusQ-JA5APA8zLAQSPGSRqNQRUZ2yhhaVfBAliQlAffhpOIoSNpZPmbmQaQ0tK9PS--Bp3AuI3NZRqDqIE3dF)**\n\nSeveral current threads revolve around the notion of Deep Green Tech. While there is a lot of interesting discussion around this concept, it has yet to be clearly defined by the community. From what we can gather so far, Deep Green Tech is similar to Deep Tech, describing mainly startup companies based on substantial scientific research and innovations in tech engineering. Deep Green Tech, broadly, seems to describe technology that is ecologically sustainable, innovative and based on scientific advancements. The concept of Deep Green Tech appears to be a central area of focus for the NGI Forward community, but there seems to be ongoing confusion around the term's definition, its ramifications and implications. One way to cut through the opacity of these discussions would be to directly ask community members to define the term while also offering concrete examples of its application, e.g. in design, research, tech innovation etc. \n\nA notable tension that arises in community discussion on tech and the environment is that between navigating the ways in which tech/internet can help combat climate change and protect the environment and the energy and ecological costs that technological advancement has on the environment. It might be interesting to address this tension with some pointed questions.  \n\nFinally, an initial visualisation of the codes pulled from the NGI Forward threads revealed a range of central, yet general themes. This may be again based on the cautious atmosphere of community interactions at this stage, but it also seems to be linked to the absence of concrete examples and personal narratives. In short, we are missing the meat of these issues because community members are not engaging with them on a personal level and instead are drawing on general and 'objective' material. Going forward, we can use the fact that we are working with tech experts to our advantage by asking them more biographically oriented questions, which may help us tease out personal narratives and interpersonal connections. Asking our informants to tell us what motivated them to work in tech, how they use the internet on a daily basis, etc. can help us capture a more dynamic picture of the internet of humans. We can also push them to dig deeper in their analyses and offer opinions on specific questions and future potentials through more pointed and guided enquiry. \n\nLooking back on Open Care, it\u2019s rare that people have detached and impersonal stories about healthcare experiences. We need to find ways to explore similarly impactful or meaningful avenues around the Internet\u2014 to get people to share stories about experiences or opinions formed from experiences, not just abstract ideas.\n\nOne of the central things we\u2019re taught when doing the interviewing /question asking part of ethnography is to get people to be specific by asking specific questions (this is what community managers on ER are always trying to do) \u2014 to move people away from the general and tell us what they did yesterday, to tell a story about a specific time something affected them, and so on. In Open Care, instead of asking \u2018what do you think of healthcare\u2019 it was \u2018tell us about a time you interacted with the healthcare system\u2014 what did it look like? How did you feel? What issues came up for you?\u2019\n\nIf we can find such parallels on the Internet (rather than \u2018what does the future look like to you\u2019?), instead \u2018tell us about the last time something online upset you, and why?\u2019 (or other questions along those lines, around sustainability for example) we might get more engaged and specific responses.\n\nIn short, the idea is to move away from asking how community members think and feel in general and toward asking about specific experiences, recollections that prompted emotional reaction, opinion forming, or action from them.\n\n@nadia @alberto @noemi @johncoate", "created_at": "2019-10-31 10:52:21.774555", "updated_at": "2020-10-17 11:51:36.551998", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1174, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 92.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 4022, 4096, 4, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60443, "user_id": 5423, "topic_id": 10419, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Z tym \"w ca\u0142ym \u015bwiecie przyrody\" to bym by\u0142 jednak ostro\u017cny.

It\u2019s huge \u2013 the downstairs is open plan, with lots of exciting and strange events going on in the evenings. Studio Beta, the co-working space upstairs, is equal parts cozy and quirky. And there are no shoes allowed in the entire building, which added to the creative and comfortable vibe of the place. I got a lot of work done! During my stay, I got to go to a Lego-themed book launch (we had a great time building all kinds of structures), see a village of shipping containers constructed in front of me, and meet people working on interesting projects. On day 1 we connected with an artist who had created an artwork set in the Mittag-Leffler Mathematics Institute where my partner was working \u2013 Stockholm is small enough that such coincidences and overlaps seem to happen frequently. I brought my visual anthropologist friend to Blivande and she was also enamoured with the space.\n\nThe most fun I had was definitely talking to Hugi about things we could do in the future. We are getting Babel Between Us, the project Hugi and Jakob dreamed up and secured funding for, up and running. The project makes me excited because we are applying ethnographic methods towards a more open-ended, artistic endeavour than we ever have before, engaging with how people collaboratively and improvisationally tell stories (and interpret them). Community members work together to engage in a collective writing process, while a second group acts collaboratively in the role of ethnographer, continuously analysing the produced content to distinguish emerging patterns as codes (my role). SSNA has so far not been made on an autotelic or non-instrumental social network, and the goal is to see what concepts and conceptual maps emerge from a non-instrumental process. I\u2019m excited to apply ethnographic methods to a less conventional subject method, but one closely tied to my own research interests in social/collective imaginaries. The project is ongoing, and I\u2019m excited to help to imagine new modes of dissemination of our research outputs that reach wider, non-academic audiences as well as academic ones. The imagination is a hard thing to study, but crucial to our understandings of how social worlds come into being and how meaning is made and shared. I think using SSNA to study more creative collaborative world-building projects could shed light on a lot of concepts that are generally hard to get at using more conventional social science methods.\n\nPart of the constructive potential of my PhD research involves understanding how people imagine their future communities through interaction with objects like the built environment and technology (specifically, the combination of both, as cities become saturated with technology). In many ways, this question is deeply humanistic and subjective, often difficult to approach as people rarely articulate these sentiments readily and clearly. The storytelling project, I think, helps us develop methods to understand such social imaginaries, maintaining the qualitative richness of human stories while also systematically studying and mapping them.\n\nHugi and I also talked about ways to secure funding to expand Sense Stack, developing SSNA further. We started to map out the existing terrain of QDA analysis tools (spoiler alert: it\u2019s bad out there, as any qualitative social science researcher will tell you). Both of us are dying for the chance to devote lots of time and resources to expanding our awesome SSNA methodology and getting it out there in the world for other people to use. After every presentation I give, I have lots of researchers coming up to me asking how they can use our software for their own work. We\u2019d love to be able to give them an answer in the strong affirmative in the near future!\n\nWe also constructed a proposal (in part with @alberto)  to analyse emergent ways of arranging support, care, and affective networks across the life course (beyond the traditional nuclear family). We speculate that a lot of people are undertaking new and changing domestic arrangements and romantic relations, which are likely not being taken into account in the structure of government service provision, and contextualise these changes in historical shifts in care provision (from community, family, and state). We see an opening up of relationship configurations that we want to query and understand further. We will write this proposal up on the platform imminently (our resident ethnographer has been slow on this one, and she apologises :smile: )\n\nBased on ideas from a contact of Hugi\u2019s, we also discussed the possibility of conference SSNA--- a SSNA that analyses the interests of conference attendees before they arrive, and shows them a map of their interests and connections with each other once they get there. This means that people arrive and kick off the conference with a richer agenda, leading to richer conversations and letting them know who they might want to connect with while there. You see not only who else is in the room, but who else in the room cares about what you care about. You can also see what the community as a whole is thinking about. Conferences are often physical manifestations of particular scientific or knowledge communities, and our method may be well-suited to mapping them. This is also monetisable in easily imagined ways.\n\nIn short, I loved my time at Blivande and hope to be back there soon!

As we sat down yesterday, I discovered a fellow people pleaser who makes food for their neighbors and coworkers and leaves it on their door (!)\nAn edited version of our chat below. His words in Italic.\n\n_My name is Manuel, I&rsquo;m a content marketer and strategist. I help my clients define what they are going to say online and how to organise information on their websites. I also run courses on writing for the web I lived in Spain, in Santiago de Compostela where I studied; in Strasbourg (as an Erasmus student); in Warsaw, and for 15 years in Brussels, where I call home._\n\nTell me about your experience of living with others. How it happened, where, how old were you, how long it lasted.\n\n_The first time was at university, at 17 years old. I experienced student flats, the first time I left my parents. I lived in different modalities, the first one was a service that made everything ready for us. I think my parents were afraid I wasn&rsquo;t able to live in an autonomous way, so they decided to put me here where everything was done for me haha. We even had someone who cooked breakfast for us. It was a luxury student apartment. The second year with a group of friends we moved to another apartment where we had more autonomy. Later in a shared flat, then in a campus with a lot of students in Warsaw._\n\nWhat would you say was the primary motivation to live with others, at the time?\n\n_I think shared costs and sharing life stories. It was about living with friends, living with people we got along well. We shared a lot of conversations in the evenings, we partied together. Life-sharing with friends. It was quite temporary. Each academic year we would think about where we would go next year._\n\n![Manuel%20and%20food|690x459](upload://q3ryfT3kqClLxAuIM9Ki9C9CI0L.jpeg) \n\nWhat has been your experience of sharing things with others (space, objects, food, means of transport..)?\n\n_It depends a lot on the situation and the type of people you live with. The thing that first comes to mind when we talk about sharing is food in the house. Some people prefer to buy their own food, so everyone was buying their own independently. I liked to share food, and cook for others. It&rsquo;s difficult to find an equilibrium. The timing is different, the type of food they eat is different. I never managed to find a household in which we have this time to have dinner together regularly. I ended up having dinner alone, a lot. In the working spaces it&rsquo;s changing a lot. [nowadays] I go to co-working spaces in which we have meals together._\n\nAnd presently, are you still in shared housing?\n\n_I rent a flat, I share it with my girlfriend. I shared it previously with someone else, and at a certain point I invited my girlfriend to come. I think we are good for now, but maybe in the future I&rsquo;d like to change again. We are open to discuss other possible scenarios._\n\nIs it possible that you, like me, are predisposed to being and sharing with others more, because of our professions?\n\n_For my personality, I gain energy from sharing with people, so I need that. I don&rsquo;t know if it should be at home or in the work environment, but I need my quota of sharing in my day._\n\nWhat do you think is your personal limit for sharing?\n\n_Definitely you need space when you breathe, when you are alone, and I have that. And i am aware this is a luxury. In terms of boundary, nothing comes to mind. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I take more than I give. First, the idea of abundance. There is a lot in the city, I like to find a lot of abandoned goods that I bring to share. There are different ways of sharing, not only economic. Some people have more ease with that, but others share recipes, time with cooking, cleaning, and this is all good. The important thing is that you actually think of the everyday / every week: what am I going to share in this space? Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t involve buying anything. [with food] I just go to the market and I do &ldquo;recup&rdquo;, getting food for free. It&rsquo;s not only about going to the supermarket and spending 50eur for groceries._\n\nThinking about your current living situation, are there things you want to do around the house, but you cannot now?\n\n_Some gardening. I would like to set up a potagier (gardening on the small terrace). We want to do it next season, and take advantage of rainwater. The plan is to create a tailored wooden structure to occupy half of this space. Another thing that&rsquo;s always there on my todo list is to open a space for conversation with the neighbors - some kind of a saturday cafe, or an open day when you animate a small community. I&rsquo;ve tried, but it&rsquo;s difficult to keep up because of my job. I was opening too many projects, it wasn&rsquo;t sustainable._\n\n_We share the same house with another household, and every week I leave a tupperware of food for them, if I cook too much. I like this food sharing thing. They don&rsquo;t come over, I just leave the tupperware in the door. I tried to find some other ways - like sharing tools (water filter, 3D printer) but it did not work with my neighbour.. But we share the Internet._\n\nWhat do you think about this: Edgeryders are looking to set up a new space in Brussels, The Reef: a residential building where 20 people can live together, share some working space, and live as ecologically as possible.\n\n_I think Brussels needs it. We need more open spaces where people are welcomed and they can meet their neighbors. We need to make better use of the spaces that we have - it&rsquo;s too much closeness and compartmentalization in this country. This is a country where it&rsquo;s too much in the DNA to own your own house. I think the city would benefit a lot of this kind of alternative narrative so that we challenge this kind of hard core established narrative. It&rsquo;s similar in Spain, but in Belgium even more - it&rsquo;s hardwired. You have to own your house, otherwise you are not really Belgian._\n\nHow many of your friends in Brussels are owning their place or planning to? What do you notice about people&rsquo;s future living plans, where are they headed?\n\n_I would say 70%. It makes sense from the economic point of view. But aren't we all trapped in this rapacious race to make as much money as we can?_\n\n_People&rsquo;s living plans are very different. I have some friends who want to leave the city for the countryside. Some they buy great houses in bobo areas. Some squat. I have very different profiles of friends haha_\n\nDo you see yourself in a place like The Reef?\n\n_About shared living: I don&rsquo;t really know what is possible legally, and socially if it would fit me. I would need to know more. Definitely having access to more space, even if it doesn&rsquo;t belong to me, makes sense. But someone from the project needs to dedicate some time to do the hosting and ensuring that everything is flowing in this kind of shared use of the space. You need governance, and a host, to ensure that the equilibrium is sustainable._\n\nShould it be someone from the group or from the outside?\n\n_Maybe it can be a task that someone from the group takes on, any month. I would not leave it in the air._\n\nWho do you think this new kind of space would be good for?\n\n_I think for people who feel a bit isolated, they need to connect a bit with the city, with more people.. who have a need to socialize. I think that different types of profiles would complement each other. For example, an older person a little bit alone could perfectly match with a family with kids who don&rsquo;t have enough time to spend with the kids. As diverse as possible._\n\n## If you are interested in this topic, join us on October 24th in Brussels for the workshop:\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/how-can-we-live-with-others-in-a-shared-property-register-for-workshop-on-24-october-in-brussels/11039\n\n*This activiy has been supported by*\n\n![EIT-Climate-KIC-EU-flag|690x254](upload://fsdKpqMpGPFDTcZgx338atkSh0Y.jpeg)", "created_at": "2019-10-11 07:46:55.314730", "updated_at": "2020-01-21 14:16:53.342208", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1509, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 148.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [60791], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35306, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6880, "post_number": 3, "raw": "you already filled it in Murie - thank you <3", "created_at": "2017-09-03 10:34:36.527750", "updated_at": "2017-09-03 10:34:36.527750", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 17.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [35282], "is_liked_by": [3769], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66348, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 11997, "post_number": 4, "raw": "I once went to an early UI lecture at Stanford where the speaker described various media in terms of how \"casual\" they are, or are not.

You need longitudinal studies/examples of how stewardship based business models can perform well in the long run.  And by Stewardship I am referring to the concept as a general idea of caring for something so that it remains healthy for the future - rather than a specific form of incorporation.  One of the more interesting examples is that of [Handelsbanken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handelsbanken), one of the major actors in the Swedish Banking sectors. You will find a detailed description of it and other examples in this anthology: [politisk-och-ekonomisk-demokrati-i-tillsammans-3e-korrekturet.pdf|attachment](upload://9FxWdwyXjZwL7DtM0sQLHDutgnS.pdf) (266.8 KB).   \n\n2. A few years ago, we ran an Edgeryders community event aimed at making sense of Stewardship of material, immaterial and relational assets. It was the culmination of a longer conversation which started with people in the community travelling around Europe and conducting interviews with people who were running for social good projects from community gardens to larger scale initiatives. Maybe the thread on https://edgeryders.eu/t/stewardship-through-market-goggles/4060 might be of interest. You find the fill report here: [263421647-Can-networked-communities-steward-public-assets-at-scale.pdf|attachment](upload://mxtpwvnuU9VbxBB1aZtM9lZ2dqW.pdf) (37.1 MB) .\n\n3. More recently: Nathan Schneider ( and I suppose others with him) have put a bit of thought into this, while I do not see any mentioned to date) are exploring what they call an \"exit to community\" alternative to the usual VC path: https://hackernoon.com/startups-need-a-new-option-exit-to-community-ig12v2z73", "created_at": "2019-12-16 11:29:00.422202", "updated_at": "2019-12-16 13:20:59.596025", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 264, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 26.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [67542], "is_liked_by": [5538], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48781, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9209, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![06|690x287](upload://gplgiNg84RtBSWCWN1t4TTTVEhM.png) \n\n# Realities\n\n## 1. What is Realities?\n\nThe **Realities** platform is a tool for organizations to harness the information held by all of their members to model what the organizations does. \"Model\" here means two things: breaking down the organization's work into activities and mapping out how they are interlocked; and associating activities to people who are responsible for carrying them out. This model is stored in digital form and displayed in an easily navigable node view. This allows a user to select any task and see what other tasks are dependent or depends on that task and who is responsible for them.\n\n\n## 2. Use case\n\nYou are a stakeholder in a big, complex projects with many moving parts. _For example: a community wishing to produce a festival._ \n\n* You can rely on a fairly large, diverse pool of people. Each person has their own availability, motivation, skill-set and experience. \n_The whole population of the community, ranging from musicians to electricians to chefs and engineers. Some people wish to put all their free time into this effort, while some want to keep their involvement to a minimum._\n* You do not know in advance who knows what, nor who cares about what, or even if anyone has a specific piece of knowledge. \n_Is there anyone who can put up an electrical network? Does anyone want to design posters?_\n* You are not sure how best to break down and distribute your tasks. \n_Ok, let\u2019s make a festival! But what are we supposed to do today?_\n\n\n## 3. Competing solutions\n\nWhat you can do to deliver the project is to create a **hierarchy**, as many if not most traditional organizations do. Once created, a hierarchy is _blind_, because it is based on a model of the project that does not adapt and change as the people delivering the project think it through and discover new information. It is also _inefficient_, because people are matched to tasks through authority instead of on the basis of their skills and their motivations. Hierarchies are often not well suited to communities, who often rely on the passion of the volunteers and their desire to work with their peers. \n\nYou could also deliver the project through **issue tracking**. This is more efficient, since people assign themselves to tasks that they care and are knowledgeable about, without the need for matching tasks centrally. Also, it is not blind since as new subtasks are found to be necessary they are encoded into new issues. However, issue tracking is vulnerable to the [bystander effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect), so many issues remain unresolved. This creates frustration and dread in the team as the issues queue seems to grow forever despite the work team members put in. \n\n\n## 4. Unique value proposition\n\nRealities uses collective intelligence to: \n\n1.  Determine what needs to be done to complete your project\n\n2. Determine the dependency structure of tasks, i.e. which tasks depend on which other tasks to be completed.\n\n3. Keep organizational memory of dependency structures, making your organization less vulnerable to key people stepping down.\n\n4. Match people with tasks, defeating the bystander effect.\n\n5. Make the critical, but often thankless work of doing all of the above visible and the information transparent.\n\nThe main advantage of Realities is this: given a smart, responsive community you can get an organization to configure itself starting from a mission to complete, even if none of its individual members has much knowledge about how to complete it.\n\n\n## 5. Key concepts: Reality Guides, Realisers, Responsibilities and Needs\n\nA **Reality Guide** is someone who identify that a certain **Need** is necessary in order to complete a project. The **Reality Guide** identifies tasks - called **Responsibilities**, that need to be fulfilled in order to meet this need. The **Reality Guide** is then responsible for finding people willing to take on these tasks, called **Realisers**. \n\nThis system ensure that only tasks that are absolutely needed are added to the project, and that all issues have an owner - the Reality Guide. It is the task of the Reality Guide to find a new Realiser if one drops out from one of the Responsibilities that Reality Guide is responsible for.\n\nThis is in part similar to what happens with issue tracking software. There are, however, important differences.\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n  <td>\n<p><em>Issue trackers</bold></p>\n</td>\n  <td><p>\n<em>Realities</em>\n</p> \n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>\n<p>Issues are created by anyone in the community without central oversight.</p>\n</td>\n\n  <td><p>\n\nResponsibilities are created by anyone in the community without central oversight.\n</p> \n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>\n<p>\nThe creator of an issue has no ownership over it and the cost of creating an issue is nearly zero.

How Realities works \n\nFor clarity, we illustrate Realities in an example context: that of organizing a festival. \n\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n  <td>\n<p><em>\nIn the festival organization</em></p>\n</td>\n  <td><p>\n<em>In Realities</em>\n</p> \n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>\n<p>\nAlice realizes that the festival is going to need water for drinking and sanitation.\n</p>\n</td>\n\n  <td><p>\nAlice creates a Need called <b>Water</b>.

Realities connects them to the <b>Water</b> Need. Bob is automatically assigned as Reality Guide of both. \n</p> \n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>\n<p>\nBob decides to place the order of the water himself, but realize he won\u2019t be able to receive the truck because of other commitments.\n</p>\n</td>\n\n  <td><p>\nBob assigns himself as the Realizer of the <b>Place the order</b> Responsibility and starts looking for someone to be the Realizer of the <b>Receive the truck</b> Responsibility.\n\n</p> \n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>\n<p>\nBob asks Carol to receive the truck and she accepts.</p>\n</td>\n\n  <td><p>\n\nBob assigns Carol as the Realizer of the <b>Receive the truck</b> Responsibility.\n\n</p> \n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>\n<p>\nBob realizes the water truck need to be payed after the water company has accepted the order, but he does not have access to the festival bank account. \n</td>\n\n  <td><p>\n\nBob creates a Responsibility <b>Pay for water</b> and is assigned the Reality Guide of the new Responsibility. In Realities he adds dependencies showing that the Responsibilities <b>Place the order</b>, and that <b>Receive truck</b> are dependent on the Responsibility <b>Pay for water</b>. \n</p> \n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>\n<p>\nBob asks Danielle, the festival financial manager, promises to make the payment.\n</td>\n\n  <td><p>\nBob assigns Danielle as the Realizer of <b>Pay for water</b>.\n</p> \n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n\t</table>\n\n\n## 7. Data storage and what you can do with it\n\nAt this point, what Realities knows about the festival looks like this:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0b3a7f24fbf791738e7d2b0c1e78a2efcd15518c.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"571\">\n\nRealities uses a graph database, so its logic mirrors the human logic of \u201cwho is responsible for what\u201d and \u201cwhat depends on what\u201d. This graph is easy to simplify and manipulate to obtain human-readable information. A nice feature of Realities is that, as a byproduct doing the project, your team\u2019s collective intelligence builds and stores in memory a conceptual map of what your project is. For example, the Needs and Responsibilities nodes, plus the edges connecting them to each other can be interpreted as a dependency graph (figure 2). \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fe828accb2c372a93cd3eb4ef251f96fa85df0e4.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"595\">\n\nYou can also isolate the nodes representing people, and obtain a pattern of collaboration across the group of people delivering the project. This is similar to an org chart, except it focuses on the collaboration patterns. In this project, Bob is doing most of the collaborating (figure 3).\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/99053f5e9631a9ca33b6b4d17d70e71037f8bb0b.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"571\">\n\nFinally, you can take the subnetwork centered on any node. When the node represents a person, the subnetwork shows that person\u2019s role in the project. If we are worried that Bob might leave and make the whole project break down, we could start by looking at his subnetwork (figure 4). Is there some responsibilities that we could relieve him of? \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4cdf630e2de5a430d7d4ae6f827d4c6baa935510.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"595\">", "created_at": "2018-11-20 16:40:24.037695", "updated_at": "2019-08-04 00:22:21.936390", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1657, "wiki": true, "reads": 20, "score": 239.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 4566, 4635, 6183], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55654, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 10225, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Project Manager** , **Edgeryders**\n\nMarina is a project manager, specialised in cultural education, art, creativity and cultural heritage.

Nowadays if you go against narratives your video on youtube will directly be demonetised or your ability to generate income will be compromised in various other ways (in a hard capitalist society that is a threat to anyone's physical integrity as well, you don't always have to murder people).", "created_at": "2020-01-17 04:51:31.210161", "updated_at": "2020-01-17 04:51:31.210161", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 321, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 36.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [68666], "is_liked_by": [2915, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70880, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11263, "post_number": 30, "raw": "[quote=\"matthias, post:28, topic:11263\"]\nUnrelated side note: I am tempted to rename this document temporarily to \u201cThe ultimate weapon to beat coronavirus at your workplace\u201d or something similar :laughing: It certainly does not get the attention it deserves right now, where the document only argues for remote collaboration as climate protection \u2026\n[/quote]\n\n\nIf you share it with the right hashtag on social media....\n\n![image|652x451](upload://4nbtTXgSppDJeCNFVUhD5SrtCeu.png)", "created_at": "2020-03-04 10:44:46.367127", "updated_at": "2020-03-04 10:44:46.367127", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 70, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 44.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [70810], "is_reply_to": [70810], "is_liked_by": [5083, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73744, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13146, "post_number": 7, "raw": "very cool, just wanted to check :)", "created_at": "2020-04-06 13:40:13.581027", "updated_at": "2020-04-06 13:40:13.581027", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 1.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [73743], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77923, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13735, "post_number": 1, "raw": "# 1.

Having a dense network around you is one of the hallmarks of social capital, and gives you access to expertise, resources, skill sharing and financing. In a dense network, there are many ways for you to get from one point to another. A key challenge here is for people with aligned interests to find each other, and as a community we\u2019re out to solve just that.\n\nTo do this we organise seminars, workshops, hackathons, retreats, Labs, research collaborations & build exciting projects where we put what we learn into practice.\n\nThis form is a tool to help you register and make the most of the event.

At an Edgeryders event, you need to think about how what you do offline will continue online.\n<br>\n\n**Button:** Continue\n\n### \"You need to ensure that there is a core team of documenters dedicated to making sure collaborative note taking (ad verbatum) happens during the event and that participants then post their reflections in comments/posts.

An easy way to do this is for attendees to register by replying to a thread on the platform. This enables the community managers to take a lot of the work off your hands since they can help with coordination, pushing out communication campaigns to draw engagement in your event etc. Also it makes it easier to drive conversations towards high quality experiences and outcomes.\n\n<br>\n\n**Button:** Continue\n\n### That's it, all done!\n\n<br>\n\n**Button:** Submit!\n\n<hr>\n\n# 3.

Let me know if you want to see any of the project proposals - we have Rebel Village in two versions and a couple of other ideas already developed, available for anyone to have a look. \n\nThe call for a research project we're thinking of is About Societal Challenges and Arts - a wonderful fit for our interests and work. Here you can read about it: http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/transformations-17-2019.html\n\nWe're already in discussion with IETM board - they started putting together a consortium, so we'd be joining it, which is ideal as it would allow us to work with established cultural institutions and universities, while carving out our own niche in the project, and possibly combining it with some of the events and formats we already wanted to test anyway. Not to mention bringing our shiny methodology to the table. \nI would like to ask whether @Carlos_Costa would maybe be interested in having a look at this one with us? Your Useful Theater seems like a wonderful partner for this kind of investigation.  \n\nWhat else is rolling? \n\n* Blivande (Stockholm): an event space, coworking space and artist makerspace where the Edgeryders team has access for 6 days in 2019; thanks @hugi for being responsive on this!\n\n* The Place (Bedford) community theatre, aka Alex\u2019s current workplace and family. This is something to look into, as Bedford is not just in the UK, but in a funding blind spot of London and other places. Anyhow, we think of this space in terms of our future work for Climate KIC - no stress related to EU funding (I assume) and friendly space that wants to try things we thought of proposing as part of the engagement process. \n\n* ATSA - @alex_levene is rolling that ball, any updates, and thoughts very welcome \n\n* The Swarm Dynamics (London, Sussex, Brighton, Brussels) led by David Holyoake; they are making art for climate change using technology and a strong push towards messaging for system change; this connection was made long ago by the lovely @kate_g, thanks! Good partner for RebelVillage or maybe KIC again? \n\n* Jubilee (Brussels) https://jubilee-art.org/?rd_page=4-2&lang=en @jessevanwinden. Now, these guys are doing a wonderful, pretty local research and practice project called Caveat (https://caveat.be/), which \"tries to find more sustainable, balanced ways of operating within the existing legal frameworks. And when the limits of the existing system are reached, it tries to come up with possible new narratives that open up space for reflection.\" We had a few talks about it and I see great potential in exploring these questions together and taking them beyond Belgian context (obviously very interesting, but without answering questions about systemic challenges that go outside of the national realm, ideas stay limited).

When a startup has to solve or work around infrastructure issues several levels down (absence of a door-to-door postal system, street addresses, e-payment systems etc.), of course it needs more support than a traditional incubator can supply.\n\n**How to create such incubators in multiple spaces.** For the first prototypical \"patient startup incubator\" space, it _may_ be that the Edgeryders organization will rent and run the physical space itself. However, I don't think this is a scalable model since (1) our patient incubator residencies will utilize the space for only 2-4 months per year (with perhaps 3-4 more months of AirBnB rental income and the rest of time sitting idle), (2) it will often be complicated to be a company in Estonia operating a space outside of Europe and (3) creating new spin-off companies in the country where the spaces are solves this in exchange of a problem of increased admin efforts. So instead, I propose that, (1) as part of the initial batches of social entrepreneurs, we support those who want to set up and run communal spaces in their own cities, (2) we connect these communal spaces in a [network of OpenVillage houses](/t/6785), and (3) we run our patient incubator programs inside these spaces and pay a fee for the access we get. These spaces would be locally registered, self-sustaining businesses, formally independent of Edgeryders but loosely connected into a network.

A German guy (I think it was Henry, @emsone, from [Wir bauen Zukunft](/t/7127)) said something that fell foul of an American woman present there. She told him off, very publicly, as a white male neoliberal or something. We looked at each other in disbelief, for we had heard no such thing. The situation was solved by @nadia (bilingual, a native speaker of English and Swedish of very international background, and deft at navigating cultural contexts), who explained that the woman was trying to read Henry as she would read an American of his age and skin tone, and was picking up a subtext that simply was not there. She pointed out to the woman that he was doing all the work to communicate with her in her native language, and she, instead of being grateful (or learning German to improve their communication), was punishing him for not knowing the English language _and_ the contemporary anglo-American culture like a native. She then asked her to leave. \n\nTone policing is often problematic, but even with mediation, it's not clear to me who is qualified to do it in a context like Edgeryders. Few people have Nadia's ability to cross cultural borders. And people like Henry, or me \u2013 we speak good English, even great English, but we cannot guarantee the fine command of subtext that we would have in our native languages. Native English speakers might get many false positives, and think we are being inconsiderate or even violent, while we are simply out of our linguistic and cultural comfort zone.\n\nHence, consensual tone deafness. A rule that says: _to accommodate people who are operating outside their native language (in Edgeryders, that's the majority, whichever language you choose), we don't engage with anything that has not been said explicitly. If you are in doubt, ask: do you think what I wrote was dumb? Are you trying to make the point that [insert project/organization name] is a puppet of some vast neoliberal movement?

This description fits in my understanding for the open village as distributed network of  houses / living-working spaces that may grow to be living communities, scattered geographically transgressing borders ( in other words hacking them and getting around the visas and rules ) a self sufficient network supporting each other sharing resources and economic opportunities through a common online platform. \n\nI imagine people (members ) who are living there share some sort of common social contract that is agreed upon  ( not necessarily written but all share a common  understanding and openness ) . People can have several roles or can wear interchangeable hats so to speak; classified in relation to the general living condition people can be :\n\n* **Nomads** : moving around in between spaces contributing to different projects for a specific  amount of  time.\n\n* **Settlers** : are based in one of the nodes, it's their space they take care of it and of the community, they take responsibility for driving the space and nourish the community.\n\n* **Guests** : visitors for an amount of time to contribute to a specific project or expeirement.\n\n* **Local communities** : each space acts as a hub for its local community, respond and interact with their local challenges and therefore people from the local community will join the space as members of the network.\n\n* Wider network and other partners\n\nother roles can be in relation to what people are doing ( co-founders, fellows, care takers, researchers, project leads, project contributers.....etc)  \n\n\n## Why?\n\n_In simple words; The dream of living with a supporting understanding community while working and doing what you love._ \n\nThe doing what you love part is obvious, this is a global phenomena, People ( millennials ) are not satisfied by their corporate day jobs. People innovate and experiment on the side. Not everyone is lucky enough to get out of the system and do what they love. Doing this alone is very risky, doing it with together within a supporting community is a bit easier. \n\nThe other part \u201cLiving in a community\u201d \n\nhere I am speaking mainly from my limited understanding to the situation in the region and my experience as an Egyptian ( so  some stuff could be specific to the Egyptian case ) \n\nI can argue that the family in the Arab Region is still an important part of one's life. It is not the same case in Europe. I can see this, I am living this. But there is a growing sense of loneliness,  detachment from society, and urge of living within a more understanding community. ( one can see and idea of both \u2013 importance of family and detachment from society- among other stuff  in the movie [Akher Ayam Al-Madina](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5424898/)[ the last days of the city ] in case you didn't see it it is about Cairo in the period before 2011 ) \n \nA big percentage of youth are detaching themselves from the general mainstream of society, the society that they find themselves not accepted and not welcomed in, and finding their places near to people who share their thoughts, or  accept their way of living,  and respect their process of finding themselves.\n \nTo explain more, in the last may be decade or at least since the beginning of the Arab spring;Youth experienced the freedom to rethink everything- ideologies, religion, way of living-  a lot of idols/gate keepers have fallen down \u2013 secular, liberal, Islamic-  people started searching and rethinking their lives while working on different projects and initiatives in all fields. And after the current escalations in the region with the huge injustice and oppression. Well everyone is back in the shades again waiting for a better moment but working within the allowed framework.\n\nYou can see this from [Ma'erfa experience](https://edgeryders.eu/t/maarefa-a-cultural-attempt-in-egypt-self-story/6813) mentioned by @m_tantawy  how it grew to cover most of Egypt and then back to have small discussions and lectures among the core members of the network, or in [Mesaha's development](https://edgeryders.eu/t/case-study-notes-from-cairo-work-in-progress/4512) . Well people are always adapting to the surrounding circumstances, but it kinda sucks after tasting a glimpse of freedom , it is not extremely satisfying and Also people get tired and burned out by time.\n\nso if drifting to extremism is not a good way to go, where some young people joined the \"battle(s)\" in Syria, others who are trying to survive alone without interacting with the outside world a lot either by doing what they are doing within the allowed framework or leaving in the search for a better life in Europe, USA, Canada, and even Australia. \n\nPeople got the realization that working on changing everything at the same time is not working, one can see this within the [sound interviews](https://soundcloud.com/user-716915853/stephani-audi-sea-project/sets) from Lebanon,(check @Sabouny 's talk [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/we-must-clown/6752) )  may be also Lebanon has a special history but it is also an indicator that people are working at a small scale waiting for the right moment, when it comes, within the complexities of society, every piece of the puzzle should come together or at least there would be a possibility to come together.\n\nand here comes the open village, I suppose, to fulfill this need of finding a community where understanding and appreciation is there and a better way of life.\n\n\n## Personally\n\nI am one of these youth, that's why the above opinion is limited, I am also in the search to find myself and find a way to do good , do what I love, and live within a supporting understanding community. \n\nIn the past 4-5 years I have been passing through different experiences getting to know a lot of people in between Cairo, Hurghada, Berlin, during which I finished my masters, worked in various jobs ( bakery, hotel, event management, alternative city tours, online management, research, architecture, co founded a non profit which is up and running, failed in other initiatives, volunteered in some other,  \u2026learned to communicate in a new language ( bad version of German ) ...refused to do other jobs. I know that I don't want to go work a job that I hate in the Gulf Countries, or work in building the new capital or new luxurious gated communities in Egypt. \n\nAnd still searching, still living in between cities, I am looking for a \"warm\" ( literally ) place to live in within a supporting community, which I learned by limited experience that it is a blessing to have. I can see myself in this vision as a settler may be start as a nomad but by time I would love to live in such a space. \n\n\n## Where to go? (as the first spot in MENA)\n\nI have several contradicting thoughts on this, but I think going for a medium size city is a good fit. ( not the capital, nor a total rural or Bedouin area ) \n\nThe basic idea is to get away, but not too far, from the Center. there are lots of opportunities, its  always much cheaper, relatively more space, and youth are available everywhere as most of the region have young population now. \n\nThis counts as a step to a more decentralized system; decentralization is needed in many countries ( mainly the ones suffering from the French colonial system, and Egypt is one of them although we were not colonized for a long time by the French ) but it faces several challenges, one of them is talented youth/ labour, mentioned briefly by ziad in [here](https://soundcloud.com/user-716915853/ziad-abi-chaker-recycle-project?in=user-716915853/sets/edgeryders-community)  - this is another topic as its a bigger argument and depends on who will fill in the gaps created by decentralized governance.  but adding this to the internet +  sense of detachment from society and urge in building new communities gives slight edge to medium cities. \n\nthis doesn't deny that Capital cities are still in Control and even if you operate in another city for longer term you should  have ties with the capital. \n\non the other hand : I am struggling with the naming of MENA region, is there any other non-colonial way of describing the region without saying the middle east ? It just doesn't sound right :D", "created_at": "2017-09-03 18:48:50.458876", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 01:22:37.195382", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1444, "wiki": false, "reads": 38, "score": 457.6, "like_count": 12, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3729, 3826, 3875, 2569, 3947, 8, 3838, 3812, 3782, 4056, 4196], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53202, "user_id": 4679, "topic_id": 9820, "post_number": 11, "raw": "@MariaEuler the only thing is that I would not limit it to EU.

I have long been fascinated by how to solve this, and have currently come to the conclusion that part of the blame lands on longstanding browser UI design.\n\nIf the browser asks users to select a single search engine or a single homepage (or use the default), people will come to use that webservice for everything. And those services will try to address every use case rather than shine at particular ones.\n\nTo explore this I have created my own (WebKitGTK-based) web browser \"[Odysseus](https://odysseus.adrian.geek.nz/)\" and have published it to the [elementary](https://elementary.io/) [AppCenter](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.alcinnz.odysseus/) (though I will soon be deploying to other distros as well). I very comfortably use it as my primary browser, and I'm aware of others happily using it as well. But let me describe why I find it's features so valuable to illustrate my thinking:\n\n**Top Sites**\nI'm worried about people coming to rely on their homepage for most of their discovery, so I don't want to have a single one. Google Chrome's (or is it Opera's) concept of \"top sites\" provides one way for multiple sites to share that prime realestate in the form of links.\n\nThough at the request of others I plan to try another approach as well where people can set multiple homepages for the browser to choose at random for each new tab.\n\n**Web Feeds**\nI really don't like the alternatives to this early Web technology. I don't want people to waste their time reloading specific websites, and nor do I want that to be solved by having all updates routed through a centralized service. That would just defeat any decentralization the Web has left!\n\nWebfeeds allow a client application to load updates from all registered websites and merge them clientside into a single list, fully under the users control. Getting away from the AI-curated timelines of Facebook, et al. And they are useful to web developers to split and combine these datastreams however they want.\n\n**App Recommendations**\nLike other browsers Odysseus will open non-HTML and -HTTP links in other apps already installed on your computer, and it sends webfeeds to native apps as well for subscription. This is vital because without that central servers delivering code, native apps have more freedom to be peer-to-peer. And browsers should have the freedom to focus on rich text rather than being a virtual machine for networked apps.\n\nTo help the adoption of those apps Odysseus takes it one step further than other browsers: if you do not have a compatible app installed it will recommend some to you from your package repository. This currently works on any AppStream compatible distro.\n\n**To Be Done**\n**Personalized Suggestions**\nWe currently go to sites like YouTube when you want to idle away our time, but those sites do not necessarily have our best interests at heart when building their AIs. At the very least they want to keep us on their site. We need something more decentralized we can trust.\n\nThese technologies ask the question \"what pages are related to those I've visited?\" I plan to answer this with \"What did they link to?\"\n\nThat is I plan to echo back the unvisited links you encounter online as personalized recommendations. This sort of technique may also be useful for exploring problem areas, more professionally.\n\n**Bookmarks & Bookmark Sharing**\nThe common wisdom I see is that people don't use bookmark managers and instead find it easier to search for it again from Google. From a privacy and network efficiency perspective this is a big usability fail. For this reason I'm planning on basing my bookmarking system exclusively on tagging, and to allow webpages to offer some default tags to organize themselves under. Ideally making the process a single click and review to bookmark, and a single addressbar search to retrieve.\n\nFurthermore since your friends and family are your best sources of links, and to aid people in helping others to discover the pages they've found useful/enjoyable I plan provide tools to share subsets of your bookmarks.\n\n**Combined Search**\nI mentioned above that I think it's a huge problem that browsers make it significantly easier to use the \"default search engine\" than any others. To address this I plan to make it trivial to register multiple search engines and search accross all of them simultaneously, possibly filtered by some tags.\n\nAt least in the geospatial profession (and Searx) there's good support for this in the form of the OpenSearch standard, but I will need fallback logic to work with the dominant search engines of today.\n\n---\n\nI'm keen to hear what all of you are working on, and possibly how my efforts can help with that.", "created_at": "2019-05-17 00:38:19.301315", "updated_at": "2019-07-01 17:51:40.976263", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 835, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 491.4, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4650, 4022, 2915, 5135, 1856, 5138], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35189, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6873, "post_number": 1, "raw": "This is the documentation from the 3 hour workshop I hosted in Berlin at an event with cultural workers and project leaders in the Mediterranean and MENA region.

OpenVillage is an open project in-the-making by Edgeryders. We design, scout and create together spaces where people can work on their projects by joining their time, money, equipment to produce sustainable work. \nDo you have a project using open knowledge and technologies? Are you a member in co-working networks, creative collectives, a squat or any community? Do you want to join one or learn from others? The workshop is organised in three parts: 1) Show & Tell: learning about participants experiences 2) Challenge space: exploring 3 communities, physical or online, and how members collaborate  3) Connecting our projects in a 5 month roadmap, mindful of each participant's limited time.\n\nWe were 16 people from many countries: Egypt (Reem, Omar, Amira, Gehad?), Lebanon, Jordan (Dana, Sabrine), Turkey (Efehan), Serbia (Vladimir), Italy (Lorenzo), Greece (Potiris), Palestine (Maysa), The Netherlands (Helga) (also see [rough intros](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1amMUAfpRVC3K1dw_5TZERn6smzC7auWybWRHyZLisrw/edit?pli=1)). I was pleased to learn that..\n\n* Amira, one of the founders of Mesaha community space in Cairo is now trying to set up a new space in a rural area called Siwa.\n* Lorenzo who is a filmmaker in Florence is also an amateur baker using old types of wheat that has been around in the past but less used now - \"grani antichi\" is the name in Italian.

Support programs\u00a0aim\u00a0at engaging and helping children and women, but\u00a0young men, who make up around 90% of the camp, are more difficult to engage.\n\nIt's true that we see\u00a0mental health issues on the camp, including depression. These people\u00a0are currently not\u00a0supported through any projects that i am aware of. We are also starting to see a growth in\u00a0drug dependency amongst long-term residents on the camp,\u00a0which\u00a0is worrying.\n\nWe also struggle with the fact that many of the men on camp do not see the camp, or France, as their final destination.

You look it up on the web, and there it is: 250 EUR/day for a single room, pay with money or without (\"no money needed, use your pay coupons\"). You're at the brink of a burnout, feel drained and uncreative since about 7 years (could be more, you forgot), and you're pulling your hair out in search of a strategy for the long-term survival of your extractive, doomed business, which is crude oil. So you register. You don't know exactly why, but you liked the beach pictures, the pictures of these crazy creatives and their home-grown fun, and the excuse to call it a business trips with your two manager friends. Probably you remembered the hippie trail days in your 20s, the last time you felt creative and energized, something you could really need now. Also, you saw in their social booking calendar site that a solar farm investor from India and a co-founder of an algae-to-oil company are there in December. Which seems as relevant as it can be. So you book for a week, add the option to extend anytime by another two weeks if you want (350 EUR extra). You pay with money, because that's what you got and you have no idea what are \"pay coupons\" (you've only ever heard of \"bit coins\", but never had one in your hand either).\n\n> \"The little airport is only 10 kilometers from the house (called Reef), and they sent somebody to pick you up. She introduces herself as Rashida, and the car as a four-wheeled electric cargo cycle. You get to steer it, and it's fun riding this thing in the cool evening breeze. After two kilometers, the steering is already over though, as the vehicle found a retroflective line on the ground and started following it by itself after displaying a message to you. You ask what they need this for, and Rashida tells how she built it two years ago and that it normally works as an autonomous solar-powered farm tractor over the day, eliminating weeds with scissors and AI software. It also provides cost-free, autonomous transport for their goods to and from the local market, and around the farm. Rashida does not seem interested if this thing is actually street-legal (\"I think it's important that it works.\").\n\n> \"It's late already, and you go to see your room, one of only five traditional \"hotel style\" rooms in the whole compound. Why again did you not dare to book yourself into the more communal sleeping quarters? You wonder, while walking past the treehouse village dorm and an outdoor area full of rock climbing towers and little tents suspended from their overhangs. (Supposedly, there's also a supersized trampoline array somewhere that sleeps 20.) Anyway, you can change how and where you stay anytime in the Reef App, and you make a decision to try the suspended tents the next day.\n\n> Your own room turns out to be simple but comfortable, and somehow peculiar as well. You wonder why all the walls are covered in black pyramids, until you discover its secondary use from a hidden shelf with audio recording equipment. It's super quiet in your room, and you start to like the weird walls for that very reason, as you slowly fade into sleep.\"\n\n> _(\u2026 to be continued)_\n\nHope you enjoyed it :slight_smile: Dunno why, but I felt like writing some atmospheric near-future fiction that could inspire our discussions about the business model for OpenVillage houses / Reef.\n\nI feel this text should be even more extreme though \u2026 for visitors, everything they know about living and working, esp. living and working together, must be challenged by just staying there.

Here is the first one.\n\nIn the old Edgeryders Admin Drive folder, the top-level nodes of our hierarchy represented the state of a project in its lifecycle `Projects: potential`, `current`, `finished`, `recyclable`. But now, at the top of the hierarchy are teams; this is nice, as it meshes well with the team concept in Edgeryders. For now, some of the teams are permanent (Directors for legal/admin; Research Network) and some are transient, but fairly large by Edgeryders standard (POPREBEL, NGI Forward). I guess a natural step is for the Culture Squad to have its own team drive.\n\nQuestion: what happens to a project that has *both* a lifecycle state *and* a team, for example a potential research project? I propose its root is still the team, so it would live in the Research Network drive. Should we reproduce the lifecycle distinction within each drive? \n\nWhat I'm looking for here is a situation where people would, when adventuring into an unfamiliar team drive, find a more or less familiar layout. It's no big deal if you guys want to be anarchic on this, but I kind of like the potential, current and recyclable (\"finished\" would probably be moved into the archive), and am up for maintaining it within the RezNet team drive.

You will receive the link to the zoom call a day before the event.\n\nMeet Name, my co-host! We are both food entrepreneurs based in Brussels and together we will share information from the Belgian food scene and abroad, and think about how communities can support food projects.\n\nWe are looking forward to meeting you and welcoming you to our event. Before I go any further, let me tell you a little about Edgeryders - the group that puts these events together.\n\nWe are a not-for-profit organisation that supports our members in creating self-sustaining projects that contribute to a common good. We grew out of a project funded by the Council of Europe in 2011. Since then we have watched our community swell to [6000 registered users and 70,000 posts](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-visualized-a-tentative-animation/13751) - we have shared ideas and solutions, built new businesses together and some of our community have [even fallen in love](https://edgeryders.eu/t/love-love-love/955).\n\nWhen you join Edgeryders you become part of a community where every time someone shares or posts about a project, like minded peers offer advice or connect it with new information that supports the work of that person. Often it evolves into collaborative projects.\n\nWe build a deep experience that no small group or individual could reach on their own through our dense networks.

[...] There was also an anecdotal story on that the blockchain companies were starting to have problems hiring good developers, even when offering big paychecks because the social status of working in that space was so low among talented software engineers.\n[/quote]\n\nI am afraid I have seen some of this up close myself. Already, I think the NGI initiative has an opportunity to increase its own awareness of what is going on in the world of decentralized architectures. There is quite some resentment going around: \"Why are you guys only funding blockchain stuff?\" I have heard at least a couple of people make an explicit \"bigger fool\" argument: \"Yeah, it's BS, but if it has 'blockchain' in it, maybe I can get to the next round of VC funding\". \n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:1, topic:10023\"]\nOne panelist also made the comparison with the dotcom crash \u2013 most of it was garbage, but a few gems survived and had great success for decades to come.\n[/quote]\n\nWhich is to say, there is no free lunch. *Nothing* replaces discernment and responsible choice. If you are the NGI, you do not get away with supporting technologies wholesale; you need to get in there, and really look at what people are doing, and support specific projects. Which ones? The ones that are best at encoding shared values into technical choices. \n\nA final note, as an economist and a quantitative social scientist. When building capacity in an economy, it is not important to support technologies: what you need to support is people and organizations, and better still _ecosystems_ of people and organizations. Once it has capacity, your ecosystem will then be able to ride successive technological waves. Bubbles are very bad for ecosystems, because they attract actors committed to keeping the bubble from bursting. So, when given the choice between different ecosystems, I would stay away from the overheated ones.
