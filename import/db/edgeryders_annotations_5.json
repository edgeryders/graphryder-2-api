[{"id": 5832, "text": null, "quote": "What people experiencing mental health difficulties need most is to be shown compassion, empathy, a voice, to be listened to, to be believed in, somewhere to go where they will be given hope of a more meaningful life.\u2019\nCos\u00e1in Community Wellness is a recent\u00a0initiative to develop a peer-led community-based support system for people with emotional distress and mental health issues, and to promote wellness for all. Cos\u00e1in is the Irish word for \u2018pathways', reflecting our belief in different paths not single roads, and the guidance, wisdom and support that we can find in the stories of each others individual journeys. All quotes within this article are from research performed by Galway Mental Health Services Consumer Panel, the local representative body of mental health service users for the geographic region.\nGMHSCP advocates for supports and services which are fit for purpose from the perspective of service users, and the integration of users of services into the design, \u00a0development and delivery of services, working in partnership with the Irish Health Services (HSE) based on the value of our lived experience of current systems of care, and the evidence of our own healing processes.\n\u2018The most effective help I have experienced over the years, having had years of medication, psychotherapy, hospitalisation, is the support of peers, where I am treated as normal, with kindness, not judged, and not expected to conform to the medical model of treatment.\u2019\nWhere progress was slow or absent within the system, we took\u00a0it upon ourselves to prototype and demonstrate how necessary supports could be delivered in partnership and collaboration between health providers, community groups, and local authorities based on a cooperative ethos of mutual support. We believe our approach will be of value and benefit because\n\u2018it's a community based project concerned with 'well-being' which is preparing fertile ground for the empowerment and transformation of people, individually and as a group. It's organic growth reflects the personalities and desires of the people involved, making it of and for the people.\u2019\nOur belief is that properly resourced and equipped communities can provide more effective intervention in cases of crisis,\u00a0care in a more person-centred and human manner, and both at a lower cost than the dominant acute-oriented, clinical and biomedical approaches. We believe that only approaches that are grounded in local communities and emerge from their dreams and aspirations\u00a0can meet the needs which we are presented with in the time that we have.\n\u2018My experience of large organisations is that the individual gets lost in the system and become just another number\u2026 I\u2019m sick and tired of waiting for the HSE to offer people the support they want\u2019\nWe also believe that the act of mutual support is amongst the most therapeutic of acts, transforming relationships from ones of being a recipient and subject of care, to a space of\u00a0autonomy, collective development, peer provision and mutual reliance that involves people in generating their own solutions.\n\u2018Being with people who are doing whatever we can to have our lives the way we want them, seeing the evidence that people can succeed, that we can make a difference \u2013 all this has a positive effect on my own mental health, self-esteem and my ability to shape my life the way I want it.\u2019\nWe developed our initiative over the course of the Galway 2020 Bid process, using \u00a0participatory design exercises that brought together a range of groups and individuals including\u00a0independent therapists,\u00a0health professionals, service users and patients,\u00a0and other interested parties who are seeking to develop new models of community-based health promotion and care.\u00a0We then used the blank canvas of a disused city building, visioning and combining elements of artspace, green makerspace, and wellness supports that were brought together using the concept of an\u00a0integrated cultural and community hub. During this time we came into contact with EdgeRyders and the Opencare research project, and welcomed the opportunity to form productive partnerships at European level with groups and initiatives with similar ethos.\nOur current operating model exists with the support of Galway City Museum, who have provided us with the use of a room one day a week for prototyping and co-design. This is taking place as part of the Galway City Cultural Strategy, which seeks to use \u00a0cultural resources and infrastructure for wellness supports and public health.\u00a0These sessions were an extension of the earlier co-design process, deployed in a real-life environment for feedback from stakeholders and re-design. Our sessions to date have included artistic and creative process, peer support and educational sessions, based on the demand from service users.\u00a0\nCurrently delivered on a volunteer basis for proof of concept, our intent is to progress towards a cultural space and \u2018crisis cafe\u2019 on a social enterprise model, with a welcoming cafe-type front-of-house drop-in space that can be used as an open studio and learning space, with a supportive backstage of more intensive interventions, therapies and supports for those people in emotional distress. Our model is grounded in the value and authenticity of provision of supports and services that are delivered by people with the direct personal experience of the situations in question, and the expressed need based on our research for appropriate creative outlets that support emotional wellbeing and generate meaning and community for the participants.\n\u2018in Irish culture mental health tends to be seen as a failing by an individual, of an individual, in an individual. This attitude views the natural processes of emotional distress and recovery through a lens of pathology, individualised blame, guilt and shame.\u00a0In contrast, rather than attempt to seek what Zygmunt Bauman called \u2018individual solutions to collective problems\u2019, an impossible task, we felt the need for the sake of our collective sanity, to use an approach based on collective support and interdependence.\nOur story is just beginning.", "created_at": "2017-04-17 23:07:21", "updated_at": "2017-04-17 23:07:21", "tag_id": 377, "post_id": 757, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 724}, {"id": 5833, "text": null, "quote": "It is paradoxical and completely logical at once!

It's quite large as cohousing goes, and while several values are common, there is also much diversity. Some minority groups find a home here: in our case, including vegans. We try to be inter-generational, though there are more older people than younger. That's partly due to economic factors.\nIt is a surprisingly complex little society, and any group like this has its own life, its own character, which would take a long time to describe. For Opencare, I'd like to focus just on one of the challenges that I see here: how we engage with our own and each other's well-being. We have at present no special provision for caring for each other: it happens in some ways at some times, informally.\nSharing some non-mainstream values, and a vision that is not yet shared by the majority of people, there seems to be some kind of assumption that we will provide a safe space for \"people like us\", a haven from the strain of being minorities who are disregarded, or even criticised, elsewhere. This need for a sense of psychological safety does appear in various ways, sometimes surprisingly. This is often hidden in the rest of society. Otherwise, our needs are probably similar to most people's.\nWe do have methods for dealing with conflict, but the challenge seems to be to get people to engage with them. Recently, a small group of members underwent training in Restorative Circles [https://www.restorativecircles.org/]. If we all understood and participated in this, it might help deal with issues that have surfaced. Relatedly, several members have developed, to differing degrees, along the path of Nonviolent Communication [https://www.cnvc.org/]. If we all interacted with each other following NVC principles, maybe that would be a highly positive influence on our community culture, and the well-being of all of us. But how does one persuade a diverse group of people with different backgrounds and histories to engage in one practice like NVC? What about other practices, like co-counselling?\nThis brings me to outlining the challenges that I, personally, see for our cohousing group. How do we collectively approach the issue of mental and spiritual well-being, with little common ground to start with? How can we then grow (in) a culture that effectively supports the well-being of individuals, and of the group as a whole? How can we be sure that an individual will receive the care that they need? Can we rely on informal relationships, or should we organise this in some way? Part of our well-being is the sharing of common purpose: how can we frame and agree our common purposes, from members whose values diverge? Are we fixed with the vision of the founders, or can we (and do we want to) move on?\nThese are hard questions to answer, but I have the sense that we will need to answer them more and more, if we are to develop the resilience that we will need as mainstream politics and economics unravel. We need now to care for each other's resources of time, energy and good will, and as we age, we will increasingly need to look after our health and strength if we are to achieve what we want to achieve, being a positive transformative influence in the world.", "created_at": "2017-05-17 19:26:12", "updated_at": "2017-05-17 19:26:12", "tag_id": 377, "post_id": 830, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 797}, {"id": 5837, "text": null, "quote": "Care and prevention spaces would be established in the middle of society, fulfilling the basic needs of all, which ensures the participation of all so that this approach corresponds to the wishes of all and fulfills their needs.

The aim is to focus on reducing\u00a0the number of inpatients over fifty years of age with entering the hospital with preventable ailments such as heart disease, high cholesterol, dementia, and lung cancer.\u00a0\nThe hospital is based\u00a0in The Liberties in Dublin, which got its name in the 12th century due to its location just outside Dublin City's walls \u2013 lands united with the city, but still keeping their own jurisdiction (hence \"liberties\"). The area's history is still very relevant to the health of its residents.\nBeing outside the city walls, the Liberties became a hub for trade and craftsmen. The 19th century saw the Liberties become dominated by large brewing and distilling families, most notably Guinness who built the world's largest brewery there. With this industrial wealth, however, came dire poverty and slum living conditions. Today the Liberties\u00a0is a city neighbourhood of opportunities and innovation, but its history -\u00a0positive and negative -\u00a0pervades. Although having undergone much urban regeneration as well as gentrification,\u00a0the Liberties still embodies that juncture between being a centre for enterprise and commercial life as well as being home to large blocks of inner city social housing. Homelessness, drug use, and lower than average life expectancy are some of the problems facing\u00a0in the Liberties today.\u00a0\nOn researching in the area first-hand, it was observed that there was a distinct lack of male presence in local community centres, as well as a high number of men drinking alone in pubs. The Liberties Local Health project draws on this observation to engage those lone drinkers to become members of a local brewing club, where beer is brewed by locals, for locals.\nThe\u00a0project takes its inspiration from the highly successful Men\u2019s Sheds mental health initiative whose\u00a0motto is, \u201cmen don\u2019t talk face to face, they talk shoulder to shoulder.\u201d\nHOW?\nThe\u00a0brewing club for men over fifty\u00a0in the locality \u2013 where they create a low percentage beer brewed by locals,\u00a0for locals \u2013\u00a0harnesses existing local\u00a0skill sets of the hundreds of Guinness factory retirees.\nThe brewing club, \"Sl\u00e1inte\", takes it name from the Irish word for \"cheers\", also meaning \"health\". The aim of the club is to\u00a0encourage\u00a0more responsible drinking through\u00a0appreciation of the brewing process\u00a0as well as forming a sense of pride and comradery among members. The project was commended by health industry professionals after its presentation at Dublin\u2019s Active Age Conference 2012.\nWith Ireland's craft beer market having hit\u00a0\u20ac59 million in 2016 (up form \u20ac40 million in 2015) and volumes of beer from Irish microbreweries having increased by 415% between 2011 and 2015, the brewing club \"Sl\u00e1inte\" has high viability potential to run itself as a social enterprise overseen by members, bringing with it a sense of pride, achievement, and overall better health.\nUSER JOURNEY", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:36:34", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:36:34", "tag_id": 377, "post_id": 841, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 808}, {"id": 6350, "text": null, "quote": "It's really beautiful!

Voici notre proposition:\u00a0\nUne nouvelle Maison du Peuple!\nAujourd\u2019hui est un jour historique pour Bruxelles. Apr\u00e8s de longs mois d\u2019incertitude, le conseil communal \u00e0 enfin tranch\u00e9: le Palais de la Bourse deviendra le lieu commun de tous les bruxellois. Ils ont \u00e0 nouveau une Maison du Peuple!\nCe temple architectural est \u00e9videmment d\u2019abord un choix symbolique. Apr\u00e8s y avoir accept\u00e9 la tr\u00e8s controvers\u00e9e exposition Behind The Numbers glorifiant le n\u00e9o-liberalisme, la Ville s\u2019est rendue compte qu\u2019il fallait donner une autre destination \u00e0 cet endroit que celle de pure sp\u00e9culation commerciale et d'activit\u00e9 touristique. En transformant une partie de la Bourse en Maison du Peuple elle redonne une place aux Bruxellois au c\u0153ur du centre historique!\nDonnez la ville aux habitants, et tout le monde s\u2019en portera mieux\nOn ne comptait plus le nombre d\u2019actions contre les plans de la Ville: plates-formes citoyennes, regroupements de commer\u00e7ants, actions ludiques diverses... Qui ne se souvient du banc de 30 m d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au milieu de la Grand place, ou des centaines de gens pique-niquant place de la Bourse, de l'action de revendication des escaliers de la Bourse comme tribune libre d'expression politique lors du KunstenFestivaldesarts? L\u2019espace public \u00e9tait devenu un haut lieu de d\u00e9bat, mais paradoxalement ne recevait pas d\u2019endroit ad\u00e9quat pour le mener (une Agora). La participation ne remuait que du vent, les riverains ne se sentaient pas entendus. La ville \u00e9tait taill\u00e9e sur mesure pour les eurocrates, les touristes Chinois, avec commerces ouverts le dimanche, tandis que le Bruxellois devait se contenter d\u2019une ville certes prestigieuse, mais sans lieu o\u00f9 il fait bon vivre, une ville d'exp\u00e9riences individuelles juxtapos\u00e9es, atomis\u00e9es, sans liens.\nLe Beer Tempel projet\u00e9 dans le Palais de la Bourse aura une entr\u00e9e par l\u2019arri\u00e8re, et c'est tr\u00e8s bien ainsi. Mais sans occuper tout l'espace, il comprendra une nouvelle Maison du Peuple, o\u00f9 chacun pourrait d\u00e9battre de ce qui se passe dans la ville, o\u00f9 les initiatives bottom-up pourront cro\u00eetre, de nouvelles id\u00e9es pour une ville meilleure surgir. Il importe de faire de ce lieu symbolique qu'est la Bourse un espace de libre d\u00e9bat, une Agora. Il s'agit de rendre la ville aux habitants pour que tout le monde en profite, pour que l\u2019habitant s\u2019y sente bien. Alors le touriste, le commer\u00e7ant et tout les autres s'y sentiront bien aussi.\nLa Ville esp\u00e8re avec cette Maison du Peuple calmer les tensions palpables par le biais d\u2019une communication plus ouverte: un endroit de rencontre et d\u2019\u00e9coute sera ainsi am\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans le b\u00e2timent. En revitalisant de cette fa\u00e7on la Bourse, en lui donnant une \u00e9chelle humaine, la Ville aide \u00e0 fabriquer le tissu social des prochaines d\u00e9cennies. Bien s\u00fbr, le touriste y aura sa place, car la Maison du peuple sera ouverte a tous.

The story of a social studies teacher who gives an assignment to his junior high school class to think of an idea to change the world for the better, then put it into action. When one young student creates a plan for \"paying forward\" favors, he sets in motion a wave of human kindness which went nation wise. There was one main emotion which did lead these actions but also was produced or given back \u2013 love or/and compassion. Can this happen in real life?\nBoth psychologically and scientifically has been proven that positive emotions affect our health in a very positive way was well. Positive emotions release healthy hormones into our body and not only; the unhealthy release of cortisol and stress related hormones is lower as well. The most important emotions are gratitude, peace, joy, hope, and love. This external boost of positivity also creates neuro-pathways in the brain that are positive. This means that we are able to affect on the biological part of our brain and create a source of positivity which is supported externally as much as internally. Behavioral psychologists retain that even if aggressivity might be considered part of human nature, meaning that it is imprinted in our brain because of our ancestors or as part of human nature, a non aggressive behavior or approach can be taught. What would happen in the world if there would be more love and less aggressiveness?\nThe teacher on the movie says: \u201cIf you could help change the world, would you? What does the world mean to you? How often do you think about things that happen outside of this town? Do you watch the news? We are not global thinkers yet. What does the world expect of us? What if the world is just a big disappointment? Unless, you take the things that you don\u2019t like about this world and flip them upside down. How about, is possible? The realm of possibility, exists where? In each of you. So, you can surprise us. It\u2019s up to you. Or you can sit back and let it be. Make an attempt to interact with the world.\u201d And the kid gave his idea: \u201cPerson A, is me and I help three people in doing something that they cannot do by themselves.\u201d There was one condition, each person who was helped by the kid had to do the same thing with other 3 people, so there would be 9 people helped. And so on, each person with 3 people, and then other 3, and 3 more\u2026 A whole network of people helping one another.\nIn this world is so easy to be skeptic and cynic. It is bad but also the media is playing a big role in reinforcing the bad. Without even being aware we cause and attract negativity to ourselves. We fight, we hate, we break promises, and we disrespect nature, over think of our role as humans in this planet. This movie is one of those that stick with you and I have always wondered if this is something that can be applied in our everyday life. I was talking with a friend and colleague of mine \u2013 we have this new and fresh NGO, with no offices yet and we are trying really hard to get some money at least to cover costs for activities. I talked to her about the movie and the idea, if there is any chance to transform it into a project. The point where we are stuck is that we have not been able to find a way to measure the results and how to report it to the donor. However, what if we could start a campaign, spread the idea out there, and try to do it with no donors in order to not report to anyone. It needs money anyway.\nBut, what if it is possible? What if we can learn and teach how and to love? There is this video on youtube of a young man acting quit aggressively on a tram. You see all the people scared and panicking. All but an old lady, who took his hand on hers and just stayed like that sited near to him. The young man calmed down. That insignificant gesture of kindness might have saved his life and of other people who might have reacted the same way to him or with fear. Or for just ignoring him.\nThis is a project that we would love to see in practice really soon and maybe in this activity that you are organizing we might meet the right people or find the proper way to do it.

The City Administration regulated the matter for new buildings as well as existing ones. The latter faced a variety of unforeseen problems that resulted into a 10% compliance rate in 15 months since the law passed. In the common understanding, this means a public effort not hitting the target, a cracked relationship between the City Administration and private businesses and ultimately disadvantaged people still vulnerable.\nThe story begins in 2015 with the City of Milan to pass the Building Regulation article 77 that required all bars, shops, restaurants and craft activities bordering the road, to provide easy access to people with limited mobility or disabilities (the National Institute of Statistic in 2007 assessed 13.189 people with mobility disabilities in Milan). This normative action was the instrument that City of Milan deployed to overcome architectural barriers and provide universal free access to public places by 2017.\n\nIn November 2016, 12 month after the law passed the City of Milan assessed only 2.000 businesses compliant over 18.000. An article on la Repubblica, the second most read Italian newspaper, by the 5 January 2017, published these data and opened a public discussion on the subject.\nLisa Noja (delegate of the Major for accessibility policies) said: We have to make sure that very quickly all businesses comply. This year we want to get to the full application of a rule of civilization and to do that you cannot only use repressive strategies.\nIt was a beginning of a twist in the Municipal strategy and the start of a speculation about the most effective way to enforce a regulation. The new thinking included working with trade associations, like Confcommercio, as well as promoting campaigns to engage business holders.\nCristina Tajani (City Councillor for labour policies, businesses, trade and human resources) said: places that show attention to the disabled are also easily accessible to children, parents with strollers and the elderly. This does not mean that they will not be submitted to controls, but we want help the business understand that the adjustment should not only be seen as an obligation. It is also a business opportunity.\nThis is when OpenCare approach came handy. Local staff including WeMake was involved and started talking to as many people as possible, to understand what was not working and tentatively get it streight.\nListening\u00a0it was vital to start from the pieces of the City Administration that were involved from the beginning like the Major Cabinet, the Urbanistic Department, the Public Soil Occupation Office and lately Urban Economy and Work department. We have understood that the building legislation was conceived in a department and the implementing regulation was written in a different one (and of course published through another one). That gave a lot of room to officers for interpretations and tightening the instructions for businesses to prevent opportunistic behaviors. \u00a0\u00a0\nIncluding as the collaboration with the trade association got closed we\u2019ve understood more of the problems that businesses are facing to comply with the regulation, such as: high costs, complex red tape, lack of understanding of the most suitable solution and existing solutions too standardized. Since red tape is partially due to complex implementing regulations and the unclear communication follows, we started facilitating a mutual dialogue between pieces of public administration, businesses and associations. Regarding costs and production related problems, we can take it into the arena of manufacturing 4.0 by including also designers, makers, social innovators, businesses and utilizers.\nGoing where innovation beats\u00a0we have started organizing an experimentation called Open Rampe (Rampe means Ramps/Slides) in a limited area of the city that has everything it takes. The Quartiere Isola in fact has a functioning District for Urban Commerce, a civic center devoted to urban regeneration, art and crafts workshops (ADA stecca), active businesses and a long tradition of civic participation. Our idea is to engage business individually and through a public event by 11th April. Involving them into\u00a0co-design sessions pivoting around their necessities may generate unexpected outcomes.\nDealing with collective intelligence\u00a0is what we have just started doing by sharing this story here. Any input from the community could be brought into our experimentation and add value to it. It would be interesting to study this collaboration as it happens and share it.\nThis is where we stand now and the next steps are:\nCo-designing / mobilizing resources\u00a0of course we will not predefine outputs, but rather keep the sessions open to any outcomes.\nPrototyping policies\u00a0by monitoring and evaluating this experimentation.\nWe are aware that talking about \u201cenforcing\u201d a policy collaboratively may sounds an oxymoron. Since article 77 of the building regulation fits in the EU and the National legal frameworks, it is certainly a top down process.\u00a0Nevertheless, the Open care approach might help policy makers, (non)compliant businesses, users and citizens to achieve simpler, cheaper and faster solutions.\nIt would be interesting to know who else has been involved in a similar process and managed it collaboratively.

Each approach is mapped to a value between 0 and 100. The value V_i of approach i is drawn from the uniform probability distribution of numbers between 0 and 100. So, the value of approach 187 might be 43, the value of approach 1412 might be 86 and so on (notice this assumption, I'll come back to it). Groups of solvers are trying to find the maximum possible value V that they can find. Approaches are imagined as points in a circle.\u00a0\nPeople differ among them because they have different heuristics (they \"look in different directions\"). \u00a0A heuristics looks like this: start at the status quo (which is a point on the circle); move clockwise a certain number of steps to another point on the circle and look for the value of the approach at that point; repeat this a certain number of times. Formally, a heuristic is made of three integers. For example, (1, 5, 3) means:\n\n Start at the status quo\n Move 1 step clockwise and evaluate the approach you find at that point\n Move 5 steps clockwise and evaluate\u00a0the approach you find at the new point\n Repeat step 3 until you have collected 3 values.\n\n\nPerformance of individuals is measured by the maximum value of the approaches they find.\nThe way groups work together is the following: each individual goes through the process of step 3. They all compare the values of their solutions, and keep the maximum one. so, critically, there is no cost assumed in sharing information.\nDiversity is measured by comparing heuristics. It varies between 0 and 1. Diversity 1 means there is no overlap between the approaches tried by one participants and those tried by the other participants. Diversity 0 means all participants take the same approaches.\n\nLike all models, this is an approximation. I trust the proof (and honestly, it makes sense to me, though I have not tried to reproduce it). Mathematically, the result is driven by three assumptions that might not be true for all real-world problems, or at least merit further discussion:\n\nAll approaches work to a certain extent. Any approach is assumed to have a \"value\" between 0 and 100. \u00a0Some problems do behave this way: for example, fixing Edgeryders means going to the\u00a0Task Manager\u00a0and executing any one of 200+ tasks. An approach might complete only 1, another one might complete 50 etc. On the other hand, some problems have binary outcomes: either you get your car to start or you don't.\u00a0\nThe probability distribution you are drawing the value from is uniform.

The informal and open-minded atmosphere made conversations of all sorts very easy. Here are some pictures of the event.\nFor us the most important insight we gained is the following:\nThe Afghan women who cooked told us that they live in a refugee camp where they do not have any cooking facility and are therefore more than happy about every chance to cook elsewhere. It relaxes and enables them to act out. Every second week they meet up at the KitchenHub to cook. To feel secured it is important to them to be only a small and female group on those days. Therefore the size of the group is kept small even though there has been an increasing demand. Such places are rare and seem to be deeply needed. We are going to cook with one of them in a park to try out whether outside cooking especially in terms of privacy is an option for them as well or not.\nWe heard another related story at our experimental cooking night.

In Greece there is already many cooperatives, especially created as a result of the economic crisis, either under a legal form or remaining informal, and we want to support their networking as well as to expand the network through creating new cooperative initiatives.\nOne of the tools to connect those and at the same time to untie ourselves from the banking system is alternative currency networks and FairCoin is already doing this on a global level. However the currency is just a tool, what is most important is the vision and the values that incorporate the efforts. In Thessaloniki, we started quite recently but there is already some places that joined and we hope to see more of them joining very soon. In Greece there is more places in Athens and the island of Crete, where FairCoin is further connected to the local currency of Herakleion. @Noemi you can find a global directory with all the places using FairCoin here.\n@WinniePoncelet this is certainly not an easy task, especially when the effort is being made on a global scale and you are trying to create change in a global scale. But we hope that cooperation can help with all the progress. The biggest challenge I see is trust and empowerment, people to trust each other and believe that collectively they can change things. So trust to each other and trust to collective power, rather than being disconnected and antagonistic. From so many sides we are being trained to not trust each other and our collective power, but I believe that culture is gradually changing and people are becoming more inclined to create communities and cooperate. Technology and to a certain extent the economic crisis have supported that.\n@Simonedb I agree with you that it is extremely important to remain open to other ideas and projects, and this is why we were so happy to participate at the Edgeryders workshop in Thessaloniki where we met this amazing community of people! At the same time, it is also important to have clear values and objectives, so that people trust you. So openness, cooperation and values can go a long way and can bring very creative results, especially on a large or global scale.\nI invite people interested in our efforts to visit FairCoop\u2019s website and if you wish to be more actively involved or have ideas to share, please leave a message or join our telegram groups which we use for networking and communication, by sending an e-mail to: coop@fair.coop!\nPS: @Noemi, I don\u2019t think we have met before, do you mean the Festival of Solidarity and Cooperative Economy in Athens?

All other forms need to be done by the government to be effective. I was really surprised by this ballsy argument so I invited over for a drink on the hottest day of the year (35\u00b0C!) and we had a tomato juice and a great conversation.\n\nWe dived immediately into the subject. Care is a government issue for\u00a0 her that isn\u2019t at all taken care (pun intended) of. Why does the government give as much power to the pharmaceutical industry for example? Why can Nestl\u00e9 become the number one partner of a government organization called \u2018Kind En Gezin\u2019 that helps parents of new-born through the first year? For her our role as activist and change makers is to put pressure on the government to make change on a big scale possible.\nI explain her how local initiatives are bending the system like the open insulin, chemotherapy in Romania or ways that people are hacking neuroprosthetis. Even if she find them great initiative she is scared that it will not be scalable, for her if the government doesn\u2019t follow, nothing will change on the long term. I ask her why even within this idea people are rather trying to find solutions themselves then going in the street and pressuring the government. It makes sense, she says, you have an illusion doing something more meaningful while starting a project, then putting pressure on a government where the reward will (maybe) be given after many years. Instant gratification is much more popular, and with bureaucratic complexification people are less temped to get into a long battle with the government.\nBut Ginette isn\u2019t the person to only be sceptic and give critic towards ideas. She likes finding solutions. So before I explain her the principle of the workshop we talk a bit further on the big problems ahead. For her everything can be put into three categories: poverty, elderly care and work ethics. Poverty makes it impossible to take care of each other; it is a vicious circle that is difficult to get out of. Even with the best projects, people without money will not get towards it. Elderly care is also a big problem in European countries, care became profit and it is all about efficiency. Only a rearrangement about how we look at elderly care can get us out of this problem. Finally there is the way we look at work and how it makes us sick: burn out is one of the biggest epidemics of this century and involves pulls the whole family downwards. Not one political party is discussing these problems on a larger scale and that is problematic for her. The resources are there, but the unwillingness of changing is bigger. Politicians aren\u2019t trained to be vectors of change; they are the ones that bring continuity. It\u2019s the civilians that need to push the change and politics to implement it.\nDark times ahead? Maybe, but this discussion made me think more clearly about the workshop and what we need to take notice of when bringing care-project together. Like within the makers movement it is important to find a balance between corporate and counter culture partners, within care it is also important to have an open approach towards policy makers. Yes we are in a ruff path at the moment, and trust is at an all time low towards politicians. But therefor it is the moment to open our arms to welcome them towards new ways of organizing care. We need much more and easier collaboration between projects. We need especially that knowledge of the government to tackle complex problems with multiple partners. We need to take them by the hand and show them what there is possible within an open care system\nThe discussion I want to open towards the community is: Is involving the policy makers important, or will it be obsolete in the future?

The City Administration regulated the matter for new buildings as well as existing ones. The latter faced a variety of unforeseen problems that resulted into a 10% compliance rate in 15 months since the law passed. In the common understanding, this means a public effort not hitting the target, a cracked relationship between the City Administration and private businesses and ultimately disadvantaged people still vulnerable.\nThe story begins in 2015 with the City of Milan to pass the Building Regulation article 77 that required all bars, shops, restaurants and craft activities bordering the road, to provide easy access to people with limited mobility or disabilities (the National Institute of Statistic in 2007 assessed 13.189 people with mobility disabilities in Milan). This normative action was the instrument that City of Milan deployed to overcome architectural barriers and provide universal free access to public places by 2017.\n\nIn November 2016, 12 month after the law passed the City of Milan assessed only 2.000 businesses compliant over 18.000. An article on la Repubblica, the second most read Italian newspaper, by the 5 January 2017, published these data and opened a public discussion on the subject.\nLisa Noja (delegate of the Major for accessibility policies) said: We have to make sure that very quickly all businesses comply. This year we want to get to the full application of a rule of civilization and to do that you cannot only use repressive strategies.\nIt was a beginning of a twist in the Municipal strategy and the start of a speculation about the most effective way to enforce a regulation. The new thinking included working with trade associations, like Confcommercio, as well as promoting campaigns to engage business holders.\nCristina Tajani (City Councillor for labour policies, businesses, trade and human resources) said: places that show attention to the disabled are also easily accessible to children, parents with strollers and the elderly. This does not mean that they will not be submitted to controls, but we want help the business understand that the adjustment should not only be seen as an obligation. It is also a business opportunity.\nThis is when OpenCare approach came handy. Local staff including WeMake was involved and started talking to as many people as possible, to understand what was not working and tentatively get it streight.\nListening\u00a0it was vital to start from the pieces of the City Administration that were involved from the beginning like the Major Cabinet, the Urbanistic Department, the Public Soil Occupation Office and lately Urban Economy and Work department. We have understood that the building legislation was conceived in a department and the implementing regulation was written in a different one (and of course published through another one). That gave a lot of room to officers for interpretations and tightening the instructions for businesses to prevent opportunistic behaviors. \u00a0\u00a0\nIncluding as the collaboration with the trade association got closed we\u2019ve understood more of the problems that businesses are facing to comply with the regulation, such as: high costs, complex red tape, lack of understanding of the most suitable solution and existing solutions too standardized. Since red tape is partially due to complex implementing regulations and the unclear communication follows, we started facilitating a mutual dialogue between pieces of public administration, businesses and associations. Regarding costs and production related problems, we can take it into the arena of manufacturing 4.0 by including also designers, makers, social innovators, businesses and utilizers.\nGoing where innovation beats\u00a0we have started organizing an experimentation called Open Rampe (Rampe means Ramps/Slides) in a limited area of the city that has everything it takes. The Quartiere Isola in fact has a functioning District for Urban Commerce, a civic center devoted to urban regeneration, art and crafts workshops (ADA stecca), active businesses and a long tradition of civic participation. Our idea is to engage business individually and through a public event by 11th April. Involving them into\u00a0co-design sessions pivoting around their necessities may generate unexpected outcomes.\nDealing with collective intelligence\u00a0is what we have just started doing by sharing this story here. Any input from the community could be brought into our experimentation and add value to it. It would be interesting to study this collaboration as it happens and share it.\nThis is where we stand now and the next steps are:\nCo-designing / mobilizing resources\u00a0of course we will not predefine outputs, but rather keep the sessions open to any outcomes.\nPrototyping policies\u00a0by monitoring and evaluating this experimentation.\nWe are aware that talking about \u201cenforcing\u201d a policy collaboratively may sounds an oxymoron.

It seems people in such projects envisage sharing a carer as they get to the point of needing help. I'm not sure of the viability of staying in such a place when serious dementia\u00a0 or physical ailments start to occur; equally regular medication may require a qualified nurse and preventative care may require qualified staff on hand 24/7.\nAgain, I do think we need to start thinking about things in terms of the housing we are building. We can't just keep building homes for young families or \"trendy\" flats for young single people. We need to seriously consider social housing, mixed communities, purpose-built homes for the elderly, etc. Mixed housing should be mandatory for large-scale new build schemes, and not just a tiny number of \"affordable flats\" that the developer can negotiate to build in a completely different city (as is happening now in the UK!). Also social attitudes and culture need to move on; young people and families need to see a mixed community as an asset, that can bring wisdom and care for their own children within easy reach, rather than seeing it as something they wouldn't really be interested in.\nI'd listen to my previous post above on the actual issues of budgets, who pays for what when interacting with the powers-that-be, etc. What I can say from these initial cohousing projects is that they're a start, but don't yet seem to consider serious (legally covered) nursing care.\n(Are you aware of companies like McCarthy and Stone who build retirement homes, by the way? Perhaps schemes like that could be a way to progress the idea of cohousing and start people living together, with care facilities and good environments provided on top of their existing model.)\n(Final thought - have done some volunteer work in a day care centre for adults with learning difficulties before... Perhaps a similar model, with day facilities and night care facilities built separately, or being more intermingled than just nursing home residents gathered in their particular nursing homes 24/7, would be a good idea. Those who were more capable could use cooking facilities, make and create, etc. whilst in their \"day environment,\" and other age groups or people living in the local area could also come and use such facilities / interact / assist? Again, funding would be an issue, especially in our current environment of service cuts and the loss of community centres and other such facilities. However, in the long run, I do think such things could prove to save money by keeping people active and involved. (Been reading something else today on the fact that inadequate checks on the elderly costs the NHS \u00a32bn per annum due to resultant falls! So even a weekly visit to a local centre, or some interaction / activity, could prevent such things and incorporate some very simple checks - asking how they are balance-wise, quick check on visual acuity...)\nAgain - the major issue is the fact that we don't have joined up thinking, but increasing fragmentation in health and social care. Each individual element is asked to cut costs and reduce facilities, even if that results in massive costs elsewhere...\nI better stop at this point, or I'll get political again", "created_at": "2017-02-10 20:45:25", "updated_at": "2017-02-10 20:45:25", "tag_id": 416, "post_id": 29962, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 725}, {"id": 6052, "text": null, "quote": "@zazie , co-housing for people that are not (yet) in need of personal, direct care makes sense to me.

It's quite large as cohousing goes, and while several values are common, there is also much diversity. Some minority groups find a home here: in our case, including vegans. We try to be inter-generational, though there are more older people than younger. That's partly due to economic factors.\nIt is a surprisingly complex little society, and any group like this has its own life, its own character, which would take a long time to describe. For Opencare, I'd like to focus just on one of the challenges that I see here: how we engage with our own and each other's well-being. We have at present no special provision for caring for each other: it happens in some ways at some times, informally.\nSharing some non-mainstream values, and a vision that is not yet shared by the majority of people, there seems to be some kind of assumption that we will provide a safe space for \"people like us\", a haven from the strain of being minorities who are disregarded, or even criticised, elsewhere. This need for a sense of psychological safety does appear in various ways, sometimes surprisingly. This is often hidden in the rest of society. Otherwise, our needs are probably similar to most people's.\nWe do have methods for dealing with conflict, but the challenge seems to be to get people to engage with them. Recently, a small group of members underwent training in Restorative Circles [https://www.restorativecircles.org/]. If we all understood and participated in this, it might help deal with issues that have surfaced. Relatedly, several members have developed, to differing degrees, along the path of Nonviolent Communication [https://www.cnvc.org/]. If we all interacted with each other following NVC principles, maybe that would be a highly positive influence on our community culture, and the well-being of all of us. But how does one persuade a diverse group of people with different backgrounds and histories to engage in one practice like NVC? What about other practices, like co-counselling?\nThis brings me to outlining the challenges that I, personally, see for our cohousing group. How do we collectively approach the issue of mental and spiritual well-being, with little common ground to start with? How can we then grow (in) a culture that effectively supports the well-being of individuals, and of the group as a whole? How can we be sure that an individual will receive the care that they need? Can we rely on informal relationships, or should we organise this in some way? Part of our well-being is the sharing of common purpose: how can we frame and agree our common purposes, from members whose values diverge? Are we fixed with the vision of the founders, or can we (and do we want to) move on?\nThese are hard questions to answer, but I have the sense that we will need to answer them more and more, if we are to develop the resilience that we will need as mainstream politics and economics unravel.

The Malagasy people seem to have lost the desire to resist standing up to defend their rights, even though they are being trampled on a daily basis. According to statistics, 92% of Malagasy lived below the poverty threshold but no one rose up. When social pressure is too much, the point of rupture is not far, and the accumulation of frustration and deprivation often results in bloody explosions. However, this can be avoided. Just put yourself to nonviolent civil resistance! Nowadays, the Malagasy people are tired of going down to the streets to claim their rights as citizens. Why make the strike if it is to have each time the same scenario: Teaser bombs, lost bullets and blood flowing, as was the case in 1972, 2002, or in 2009? Why manifesting because it is the politicians who benefit in the end? Today, people prefer to stay at home and rant about the social network instead of expressing their frustration in public and questioning their leaders. And yet, it is not the subjects of contestation which are wanting. Traffics of all kinds, corruption, bad governance, lack of accountability of elected officials, non-respect of laws, hamper development of the country. It is now essential that the Malagasy rediscover that power belongs to them and that they learn how to fight against injustice, without dilatory maneuvering of the politicians, and without violence. As Martin Luther King Jr pointed out, active nonviolence is not a method for cowards. On the contrary, it is a real resistance. It is the art of using non-violent power to achieve sociopolitical objectives, especially through symbolic protests. This practice was popularized from 1921 by exemplary personalities like Gandhi in India, by Nelson Mandela and Steve Biko in South Africa, or Martin Luther King Jr in his fight against segregation. The Malagasy also experimented with nonviolent civil resistance, for example through publications in satirical journals under colonization, but the practice gradually lost face to the rise of the military and police repression, but Also facing the weariness of the main concerned - the citizens. Contemporary movements such as Wake-up Madagascar are now trying to awaken citizens' consciences and to revive non-violent civil resistance. Short-lived symbolic actions that do not create crowds and are therefore not illegal are regularly organized to denounce the fact of society that make jasper. Expose empty plates to say that the Malagasy are hungry, to walk in the streets of Antananarivo to demand the ratification of a charter on democracy or to make the dead on the place of independence in the city center of the capital to denounce the words which undermine the country are for example, part of the non-violent civil resistance. It is precisely to spread this philosophy on the desire for change through non-violent actions that many projects such as LIANA or Learning Initiative Aiming at Non Violent Action which was initiated by Wake Up Madagascar, Liberty 32 and the WYLD program Women and Youth's League for Democracy with the support of the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict. Since the 70's during the 1st Republic in Madagascar, Malagasy people have been manipulate and influenced by politicians who wants a place on government by force.

We are inspired by:\n\nopen source communities, that harness collective intelligence to find new solutions to old problems;\nnetworked organisations, notably Buurtzorg, the community care provider in the Netherlands, that combine the benefits of being small with the benefits of being part of something large.\ntraditional community-based approaches to care-giving that are human-centred and sustainable.\n\nWe intend to will achieve this in particular by taking over existing care home businesses and creating, one-by-one, a network of homes modelling the type of care we want to see. \u00a0Once we have established a small number of our own homes, we will reach out to other like-minded operators to create a broader community of homes around the UK.\nA key operating principle will be to involve all \"stakeholders\".\u00a0 Buurtzorg (mentioned above) has an excellent model, illustrating the various levels of involvement, and whilst this is primarily looking at home care as opposed to care homes, it is a useful way of viewing the bigger picture.\nCare home residents come into care with social networks, habits, routines and pastimes, which are normally stripped away on entering care. As far as possible these should be maintained because these are part of the person's \"support system\". Involving the family and friends as well as the wider community will, whilst it may add to the complexity, lighten the burden of care and increase quality of life for all affected.\nLegal structure:\u00a0 Our intention is to separate out the capital assets from the business of caring. The precise legal structure remains to be worked out but may be similar to a so-called community land trust (see http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/what-is-a-clt/about-clts) where one organisation (maybe a charity) owns the freehold of the land and a social enterprise runs the care home. \u00a0There would be some element of employee ownership, which has been shown in many businesses to encourage higher than average levels of productivity and profitability.\nGetting started:\u00a0 Our intent is to start by acquiring control of one care home.\u00a0 In order to keep capital needs as low as possible in the early stages, the intention is to lease premises on a long-term lease rather than buying a home. An opportunity has been identified near the south coast of England and conversations have started with the owners.\u00a0 This is an interesting opportunity, in particular because there is an chance to acquire the property and business for a low price.\u00a0 The home is currently subject to \"special measures\u201d, imposed by the Care Quality Commission.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 18:59:38", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 18:59:38", "tag_id": 28, "post_id": 758, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 725}, {"id": 6107, "text": null, "quote": "One of the first things I noticed in Brussels is that a lot of people are living in the streets.

I like how you narrowed a generic problem down to a specific one (integrate the interactive food customs / traditions).\u00a0\nIt may be harder than just writing a step-by-step guide to starting a street food activity and translating it into several languages.\u00a0I do not know Germany well, but in Italy the regulatory landscape is a lot tighter than what seems to go for Asian markets (eg Thailand). The moment you start serving food to the public, you need to comply with licensing, safety,\u00a0hygiene regulations. Additionally, many market operate a fixed number of stalls: you cannot just add a food cart as you would in other parts of the world. All of this increases the fixed costs of starting an activity. Every year, as the summer comes and festival season kicks in, the police braces to fight off illegal hawkers (who are, for the most part, just people trying to make a living, many of them migrants). The legal ones are very vocal in demanding that the police shuts down their competitors on fairness grounds (\"we have to comply with all these expensive regulations, whereas these guys just go gray economy\").\u00a0\nIn passing: within Europe there are already subastantial regulatory differences. I live in Belgium, and here tiny restaurants with toilets in the basements, that you access through narrow and steep stairs, are very common. In Italy they would all be illegal: restaurants need to have wheelchair-friendly facilities, fire exits whose number and width depend on venue\u00a0capacity, and so on. By my own guesstimate, about half of the restaurants in Brussels would have to shut down if the Italian regulation were ported to Belgium.\u00a0\nSo, I guess a first step towards\u00a0A Taste of Home\u00a0is mapping out the regulation, and trying to figure out what the minimum investment needed to start a small food related activity would be.

The story of a social studies teacher who gives an assignment to his junior high school class to think of an idea to change the world for the better, then put it into action. When one young student creates a plan for \"paying forward\" favors, he sets in motion a wave of human kindness which went nation wise. There was one main emotion which did lead these actions but also was produced or given back \u2013 love or/and compassion. Can this happen in real life?\nBoth psychologically and scientifically has been proven that positive emotions affect our health in a very positive way was well. Positive emotions release healthy hormones into our body and not only; the unhealthy release of cortisol and stress related hormones is lower as well. The most important emotions are gratitude, peace, joy, hope, and love. This external boost of positivity also creates neuro-pathways in the brain that are positive. This means that we are able to affect on the biological part of our brain and create a source of positivity which is supported externally as much as internally. Behavioral psychologists retain that even if aggressivity might be considered part of human nature, meaning that it is imprinted in our brain because of our ancestors or as part of human nature, a non aggressive behavior or approach can be taught. What would happen in the world if there would be more love and less aggressiveness?\nThe teacher on the movie says: \u201cIf you could help change the world, would you? What does the world mean to you? How often do you think about things that happen outside of this town? Do you watch the news? We are not global thinkers yet. What does the world expect of us? What if the world is just a big disappointment? Unless, you take the things that you don\u2019t like about this world and flip them upside down. How about, is possible? The realm of possibility, exists where? In each of you. So, you can surprise us. It\u2019s up to you. Or you can sit back and let it be. Make an attempt to interact with the world.\u201d And the kid gave his idea: \u201cPerson A, is me and I help three people in doing something that they cannot do by themselves.\u201d There was one condition, each person who was helped by the kid had to do the same thing with other 3 people, so there would be 9 people helped. And so on, each person with 3 people, and then other 3, and 3 more\u2026 A whole network of people helping one another.\nIn this world is so easy to be skeptic and cynic. It is bad but also the media is playing a big role in reinforcing the bad. Without even being aware we cause and attract negativity to ourselves. We fight, we hate, we break promises, and we disrespect nature, over think of our role as humans in this planet. This movie is one of those that stick with you and I have always wondered if this is something that can be applied in our everyday life. I was talking with a friend and colleague of mine \u2013 we have this new and fresh NGO, with no offices yet and we are trying really hard to get some money at least to cover costs for activities. I talked to her about the movie and the idea, if there is any chance to transform it into a project. The point where we are stuck is that we have not been able to find a way to measure the results and how to report it to the donor. However, what if we could start a campaign, spread the idea out there, and try to do it with no donors in order to not report to anyone. It needs money anyway.\nBut, what if it is possible? What if we can learn and teach how and to love? There is this video on youtube of a young man acting quit aggressively on a tram. You see all the people scared and panicking. All but an old lady, who took his hand on hers and just stayed like that sited near to him. The young man calmed down. That insignificant gesture of kindness might have saved his life and of other people who might have reacted the same way to him or with fear. Or for just ignoring him.\nThis is a project that we would love to see in practice really soon and maybe in this activity that you are organizing we might meet the right people or find the proper way to do it.

Most of our friends and family members were rather puzzled: not many couples decide to share their apartment, though they can afford not to. We, however, thought it completely logical. Nadia is Swedish and I am Italian: at the time we lived in Strasbourg, France. That made us a migrant nuclear family, completely cut off from the network of emotional and material support that our friends and families of origin could offer. We were simply too isolated in our Strasbourg apartment, nice though it was; and we decided to try something different. So, we rented a much bigger apartment than we needed and asked the Internet for someone to share it with.\nFour years on, we think the experiment worked. For the last three years we have been living with Kasia and Pierre, a young couple of expatriates (Kasia is Polish, Pierre French). We really enjoy the co-habitation: the home feels more animated, and not a day goes by that we don't chat at least a little bit, over coffee or breakfast. We enjoy the big, airy living room overlooking the city. And, frankly, we appreciate that our lifestyle is really good value for money: thanks to the economies of scale implicit in family life, we pay a reasonable rent for a really nice space.\nAlong the way, we discovered that what makes our living together so enjoyable is that we are so different from each other. We come from four different countries; we are of different ages (Pierre, the youngest, is 19 years younger than me, the oldest); we have very different jobs (Kasia is a dental nurse, Pierre is the manager of a fashion boutique, whereas Nadia and I both belong to the \"what is it that you do, again?\" tribe); Nadia and I travel a lot, whereas Kasia and Pierre tend to be in town most of the time.\nThis works well on many levels. On a purely practical level, when we travel we love the thought that the home is not empty, and in the event of some misfortune (think plumbing failure) they can intervene; and I am sure they enjoy the privacy and the extra space. We pay for electricity, phone and the Internet, they pay for the cleaning services \u2013 less paperwork to do. We have an extra room, which normally serves as Nadia's and my office; but it doubles up as a guest room for the guests of all of us.\nBut there is more to co-habitation than practicality. Kasia and Pierre are lovely people: and, crucially, they are different people from Nadia and myself. We live out the city in different ways. We have different takes on almost everything, from French politics to Belgian beer. Comparing notes with them is always interesting, and I really value their insights and wisdom. Not that we spend all that much time together. I think our co-habitation unfolded in the right sequence: we started by a default attitude of rigorous mutual respect of each other's privacy and spaces. Then, over time, we grew closer, started to share the occasional meal, the occasional outing; we met each other's friends and families, lovely people to the last one. Guess what: we have built a sort of familial-like arrangement in a foreign city, among people who were originally complete strangers to one another.\nIt's working well. So well that, when a year ago our landlord announced that he was reclaiming his apartment and we would have to move out in the summer, we decided to stay together, and to look for a new place as a four-people household. Eventually, we got more ambitious and thought, what the hell, we might as well grow the family. If four people can live so well together in a larger apartment, how would it work with five, or six, or seven in an even larger one?\nIt works well, it turns out. We moved to a lovely loft, and were joined by a third couple (Belgian-Italian). Giovanni and Ilaria have since moved on for family reasons, but we enjoyed their company while we lived together. Their place has been claimed by Thomas, a young French engineer.\u00a0\nWe do this for totally egoistic reasons: we enjoy each other's company, we save money, we live in style. At the same time, we are aware that we are working our way through solving a global problem. Planet Earth has 230 million international migrants; intra-EU migrants like us are 8 million. Many of Europe's young people simply cannot afford to hold their ground: their work, education paths, and love lives lead them to migrate. When they do, they, like us, lose their supporting networks, and it is really hard to rebuild them. Living together, especially in diversity \u2013 the older with the younger, the sporty with the mobility-challenged, the academic with the blue-collar worker \u2013 becomes a platform for sharing our different abilities, and being able, as a household, to solve many different problems, both emotional and practical.\nNone of this is new. You have heard it all before \u2013 at social innovation conferences and workshops, for example, and typically by people who live in middle-class nuclear families. But we have decided to walk this particular talk; it will probably not be the right choice for everyone, but it is the right choice Nadia, Kasia, Pierre and myself; and I strongly believe it might be right for many others. I encourage you to at least consider it for yourself: as more of us make this choice, the real estate market will respond, giving us more spaces suited to our particular lifestyle (in Brussels, for example, is very difficult to find large apartments with 3 or more bathrooms!).\u00a0So, who wants to join?", "created_at": "2016-09-18 20:36:42", "updated_at": "2016-09-18 20:36:42", "tag_id": 437, "post_id": 648, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 615}, {"id": 6150, "text": null, "quote": "It seems like your group has found just the right balance between couple intimacy and social sharing of the space, which is something that would scare many of us grownups.", "created_at": "2016-09-18 20:38:27", "updated_at": "2016-09-18 20:38:27", "tag_id": 437, "post_id": 8933, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 615}, {"id": 6151, "text": null, "quote": "But in the long run, the deal is that you have to pull your weight.

It's quite large as cohousing goes, and while several values are common, there is also much diversity. Some minority groups find a home here: in our case, including vegans. We try to be inter-generational, though there are more older people than younger. That's partly due to economic factors.\nIt is a surprisingly complex little society, and any group like this has its own life, its own character, which would take a long time to describe. For Opencare, I'd like to focus just on one of the challenges that I see here: how we engage with our own and each other's well-being. We have at present no special provision for caring for each other: it happens in some ways at some times, informally.\nSharing some non-mainstream values, and a vision that is not yet shared by the majority of people, there seems to be some kind of assumption that we will provide a safe space for \"people like us\", a haven from the strain of being minorities who are disregarded, or even criticised, elsewhere. This need for a sense of psychological safety does appear in various ways, sometimes surprisingly. This is often hidden in the rest of society. Otherwise, our needs are probably similar to most people's.\nWe do have methods for dealing with conflict, but the challenge seems to be to get people to engage with them. Recently, a small group of members underwent training in Restorative Circles [https://www.restorativecircles.org/]. If we all understood and participated in this, it might help deal with issues that have surfaced. Relatedly, several members have developed, to differing degrees, along the path of Nonviolent Communication [https://www.cnvc.org/]. If we all interacted with each other following NVC principles, maybe that would be a highly positive influence on our community culture, and the well-being of all of us. But how does one persuade a diverse group of people with different backgrounds and histories to engage in one practice like NVC? What about other practices, like co-counselling?\nThis brings me to outlining the challenges that I, personally, see for our cohousing group. How do we collectively approach the issue of mental and spiritual well-being, with little common ground to start with? How can we then grow (in) a culture that effectively supports the well-being of individuals, and of the group as a whole? How can we be sure that an individual will receive the care that they need? Can we rely on informal relationships, or should we organise this in some way? Part of our well-being is the sharing of common purpose: how can we frame and agree our common purposes, from members whose values diverge? Are we fixed with the vision of the founders, or can we (and do we want to) move on?\nThese are hard questions to answer, but I have the sense that we will need to answer them more and more, if we are to develop the resilience that we will need as mainstream politics and economics unravel. We need now to care for each other's resources of time, energy and good will, and as we age, we will increasingly need to look after our health and strength if we are to achieve what we want to achieve, being a positive transformative influence in the world.", "created_at": "2017-05-17 19:26:35", "updated_at": "2017-05-17 19:26:35", "tag_id": 437, "post_id": 830, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 797}, {"id": 6171, "text": null, "quote": "We learnt quickly that the ideas of how to use the space could never occur to someone who has never been in that exact position:", "created_at": "2016-10-12 15:26:27", "updated_at": "2016-10-12 15:26:27", "tag_id": 438, "post_id": 703, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 670}, {"id": 6172, "text": null, "quote": "I contacted the new owners to see where they stood and a few months later I sent them my strong proposal where I aimed to take on the castle as is, and start an artist\u2019s residence and a cultural music venue.

I've recently been reading a lot of Thomas Mann and it's almost the entire structure on which his work is predicated. There seems to have been a sensibility that was propagrated in the late 1800s -early 1900s European intellectual/artisan culture around 'bohemianism' or latterly 'bourgouise'. I think in some senses it emerges out of a combination of Romanticism (in poetry and visual art) and it's opposite reaction,\u00a0Realism (in painting and literature) and the beginnings of the sentimental nostalagia-tinged\u00a0classical music of people like\u00a0Verdi and the German/Austrians like Liszt, Mendelsohn.\u00a0\nThe 'struggling artist' becomes a trope, a series of hooks onto which musicians, writers and painters can hang their emotional responses to the world. The struggles of the artist can therefore\u00a0be equated to the struggles of the working, pastoral man and woman, who often during this period are the themes on which the artist work. c.f Beethoven's 6th, Robert\u00a0Burn's Poetry, Victor Hugo.

(Matthias on the Writer's Workshop in Kathmandu)\nI (Noemi) suggest efforts to secure timely live translation are set up in advance\nfollowups are always tricky - rigourous collection of documentation may not be enough. engagement to deliver on key promises would be welcome\u00a0(if there is enough support from this)", "created_at": "2017-01-03 15:57:05", "updated_at": "2017-01-03 15:57:05", "tag_id": 62, "post_id": 6005, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 5972}, {"id": 6204, "text": null, "quote": "\"Podziemne Pa\u0144stwo Kobiet\" is both a documentary and a collection of abortion stories from Polish women who had illegal abortions in the past two decades. Poland most likely is the only country in the world that had abortions legal by law (1956-1993) and changed it \"backward\".\u00a0We ended up having one of the most restrictive laws in the world, and the legislators were smart, by\u00a0avoiding criminalizing women (with whom society would sympathize) and focusing instead on everyone else who assists with abortions (the penalties are up to 8 years in prison), creating a system of fear and paranoia.\u00a0\nThe first thing that strikes\u00a0about abortion in Poland is the statistics - according to Polish Ministry of Health in 2013, there were 744 legal abortions and 718 of them due to the risk of birth defects. 3 of them due to rape and 23 due to the risk posed to women health. In 2015 there were 1044 legal abortions. For a country with 38 million inhabitants, these numbers seem just wrong. In Spain or UK, these numbers are 200 or 400 times higher. And it's estimated that illegal abortions every year account for between 80.000- 200.000 cases in Poland.\u00a0\nSo, what kind of abortions are available in the underground and how do women access it?\nChirurgical abortions are one of the common ways. They\u00a0usually happen in\u00a0hidden spaces, often barely up to any standards, with basic equipment, sometimes only in the presence of doctor (women who come to get the abortion might end up assisting them). The price of an abortion is at least\u00a02000 zl (500 euros), and it tends to go up with the standard. In some cases, when doctors are well connected, they can even perform them in hospitals, which would double the price. Many doctors who refused to perform a legal abortion are perfectly fine with doing it illegally after settling the price with their patients.\u00a0\nConsidering that the minimal wage in Poland is 1850 zl, and the average is 4000 (yet many people struggle to get contracts, work on 3/4 of full time, or often work on irregular gigs earning even less than 1000 z\u0142 a month with no minimal wage per hour), the price is quite prohibitive and exclusive. Many women end up taking\u00a0loans to pay off their abortions.\u00a0\nNowadays, women contact pro-choice organizations to find out\u00a0who can help them with abortion. Since the 90ties, press and internet advertisements were the ways to find\u00a0doctors who'd perform them. Such services would be named as \"painless restoration of menstruation\"\u00a0- and involve either chirurgical help or access to drugs, highly overpriced. In many cases a friend or a relative knows who does it in your town. The fear and paranoia remain anyhow - women are asked to leave the clinic right after the procedure is done, regardless of their condition, in order not to bring suspicion. They're asked to park their cars far away from the place of appointment.\u00a0\nSome of the informal groups specialize in organizing abortions abroad. Ciocia Basia, a group of volunteer activist, helps to organize legal abortions in Berlin. For a price of 290/390 euros, they arrange pharmacological and chirurgical abortions in clinics, help with translations and offer a couch for the women coming over. Another popular destination is Slovakia and Czech Republic - it's super easy to find websites in Poland of clinics in these countries that provide with professional and anonymous help. Prices are similar to those in Polish underground.\nAnd then you have the pharmacological abortion. There are two drugs containing\u00a0misoprostol registered and available in Poland, one of which can be bought without the prescription. Women usually end up making up stories about stomach pain or rheumatic grandmothers to buy them. Sometimes both of them can be obtained from \"under the counter\", forums also advise to ask a man to help\u00a0buy them. Misoprostol should be accompanied by mifepristone to increase effectiveness (the combination of both has 98% effectiveness, while only misoprostol alone is between 80-90%), but the latter drug is not registered in Poland. In this case organizations such as Women on Waves help to buy and ship\u00a0them from other countries (they ask for donation of minimum of 70 euros, but they do support women in economic difficulties by providing them for free). It is well known that some of the doctors write prescriptions for these drugs (a pack of 12 costs 25 zl, but can be sold 10 or more times more expensive on the black market) and help women get access to them via advertisements. It's impossible to track as these drugs are not refunded by the state - therefore not registered anywhere.\u00a0\nDue to lack of widespread support, some of the women organize support groups on online forums. They look for other women who seek\u00a0abortions or just had one, share their stories\u00a0and explain to each other what happens to their bodies, how to access drugs, if nausea is a normal reaction to pills, etc. As in some cases, pharmacological abortion can lead to prolonged bleeding and even death, they offer each other a call of support during the abortion, which takes up to a day. It's recommended to call for an ambulance in case of emergency - doctors cannot tell if the miscarriage was illegally inducted or not, and that save\u00a0lives in some\u00a0instances of home abortions.\u00a0\nI am still reading some more about the abortion underground in Poland, and if I find some more interesting facts, I will updated this text.

And: a mainstream practice of living that makes difficult to introduce care activities in the daily life (due to work constrains, to the evolution of families and to their being scattered in different places).\u00a0Therefore, given the present structures of family and work, few people can commit to offering care, especially if this requires continuity, high responsibility and duration in time", "created_at": "2016-07-23 14:17:05", "updated_at": "2016-07-23 14:17:05", "tag_id": 447, "post_id": 5397, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 5364}, {"id": 6260, "text": null, "quote": "Which new kinds of understanding are needed and which cultural defaults block them?\u201c", "created_at": "2016-07-24 12:20:22", "updated_at": "2016-07-24 12:20:22", "tag_id": 447, "post_id": 4838, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 4805}, {"id": 6261, "text": null, "quote": "No, Lucas, technofixes are not enough.

When ever an adolescent brings up a topic around \u00a0reproductive health or sex \u00a0education, they are usually severely punished \u00a0and regarded as been disrespectful to their elders. Due to this absence of discussion on sex education, many adolescent young girls face lots of challenges and stigma at their puberty stage, especially during menstruation.Most parents in Cameroon especially in the rural and grassroots areas, don't know that they have to provide pads for their girl children during menstruation. They don't even give their girls advice when these children even summon a little courage to inform them that something abnormal is happening with them .According to many parents, these children are very immature and still very young to be able to handle understand and process issues on puberty , reproductive health and menstruation. Because of this lack of discussion between parents and children on sex education, many of these girls, during menstruation are forced to stay away from school because of stigma from boys who often notice blood stains on their uniforms and also the unpleasant odor which \u00a0cames out of the bodies as a result. \u00a0Their staying away from school, makes them not to be performant as they ought to be like the boys and this plays a key role for their poor performances. Some stay away for two weeks and others for a month, just to avoid this stigma. As a youth advocate to encourage parent children dialogue on sex education and advoacting for Access to reproductive health knowledge, i have had time to hold some trainings with a few groups of adolescent girls to tell me about their experiences. \u00a0As a result of lack of menstrual hygiene, due to absence of \u00a0dialogue between them and their parents, \u00a0i was amazed by the stories i got. Some said, as they approached their parents \u00a0when\u00a0they noticed boold stains on their pants, they were thoroughly scolded and driven away and warned never to discuss any thing on menstruation. Some said, they were forced to carry dry dust and sand to\u00a0insert into their vaginas in order to stop the bleeding as they knew not what was happening to them. Other stories came up like using \u00a0dirty clothes to pad themselves, which was very in hygienic and gave them some genital infections. \u00a0As a result of this lack of knowledge on reproductive health for adolescent girls, many have dropped out of school because of unintended pregnancies, some have contracted sexually transmissable infections and others have been forced into early marriages , to the boys that impregnated them. Many of these \u00a0adolecents have lost hope for a better future, because they are now in condtions due to necglect and lack of reproductive health knowledge. \u00a0so i am hoping to enlightened parents and the community about the importance of sex education and also advocating for this curriculum to be taught in primary and secondary schools in Cameroon. I am hoping, to equally train these adolescent girls on matters of gender equality, menstrual hygiene , family planning and reproductive health as a Whole. In Africa, there is an ardage which says \"Charity begins at home\" if \u00a0discussions between parents and children are initiated at home on sex education, it will go an extra mile to enable parents understand their daughters and support them effectively , so that they will not be statistics of unwanted pregnancies , school drop outs and poor academic performance in school. If Access to knowledge on reproductive health is improved upon \u00a0for parents and adolescent girls, then sustainable development will be ensured.

But because they are our reality. They exist and to not acknowledge that is to cover ourselves with superficial banalities. The crises that continue to arise are merely symptoms of the disintegration of a way of being in the world that is becoming rapidly untenable. So when we think of care, we must take on the task of being a bridge to a new way of being. \u00a0\nAt Woodbine, we are continuing to develop a path toward health autonomy. We are looking to meld many different modalities of health. \u00a0We have been experimenting with different projects and finding ways to build community. We\u2019ve had a garage gym with weekly fitness classes, open hours in our Resource Center, and ongoing public workshops. Our series of \u201cskill shares\u201d, has included subjects from acupuncture to foraging urban medicinal plants, to workshops on first aid and large discussions questioning what communal health really requires. Autonomous mental health infrastructure seems to be the most pressing immediate need of our community. This is a key place we are focusing our energies at the moment. We find that the act of sharing responsibilities, allowing for new innovation, and practicing vulnerability with our comrades are the first steps to addressing these larger questions of health and care.\nWith the proposed health care cuts as well as the general trend our government is taking, we fear that some heightened level of austerity will be upon us. As resources to critical health infrastructure are being threatened, as evidenced by Planned Parenthood cuts, the war on women\u2019s health, and the potentials for immigration officials to use health institutions as a screening tool, we are increasingly seeing a need to provide clinical as well as educational resources. Because of the immense cost and regulatory difficulty of providing clinical care in NYC, we need to seek and develop work-arounds. As we see the needs increasing, cuts being made and draconian measures to make non-violent actions to protect water punishable with prison sentences, we can only imagine a future where care for ourselves and our fellows will become increasingly criminalized. Therefore the steps we make to gain and share skills and develop subterranean practices of care can return some of the agency we\u2019ve lost to the professionalization of medicine and the profitable mystery that is our bodies. As we think about expanding our capacity, we don\u2019t want to just \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d of public health infrastructure. We need to slowly break our dependence on these institutions in all the ways that we can and also look for ways to use them to our advantage. We think this happens through sharing knowledge and skills, an emphasis on preventative care, and finding ways to manipulate existing structures to allow us to move forward on this path of autonomy. \u00a0\nWe believe in the utter necessity of revolution, of the development of material lines of power. Questions of care and health autonomy are pivotal to that progression. \u00a0From the Greek solidarity clinics to the Zapatistas \u201chealthcare from below\u201d to Black Panther Clinics and GynPunks, there is inspiration for this path all around us. \u00a0We begin by finding each other.", "created_at": "2017-06-27 14:05:21", "updated_at": "2017-06-27 14:05:21", "tag_id": 80, "post_id": 6376, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6343}, {"id": 6295, "text": null, "quote": "When I was younger living in San Francisco which has a very high Asian population, it seems like all of my asian friends had an elderly relative, usually a grandparent, living in their house. \u00a0Every time I went over to this one friend's house in Chinatown, granny was always in the kitchen cutting up vegetables or something. \u00a0I would see that and think, \"that isn't gonna happen at my house.\" \u00a0Neither generation wanted it.", "created_at": "2016-11-27 14:31:51", "updated_at": "2016-11-27 14:31:51", "tag_id": 449, "post_id": 21579, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 757}, {"id": 6296, "text": null, "quote": "Perhaps this strength of intergenerational bond in Middle Eastern culture is down to having a more cohesive and\u00a0consistant\u00a0view of the world than we have in the West.

It came up to us through some interviews we and friends conducted in the last weeks with refugees or other newcomers in Berlin. What are your thoughts on this?\nTo make it easier for everyone interested to follow I will try to sum up the thoughts we had and the experiences we made recently.\nStarting with the question \u201cHow can food help people on the move to feel at home wherever they are at the moment?\u201d amongst others we got to talk to a 24 year old guy from Syria and a girl from Korea about the same age. One had to flee home and the other moved for love.\nSome of the most remarkable insights we got are about food some are not. Two I want to share because they add to our design question.\nThe guy misses the Syrian nights where as he tells everyone takes their coaches and pillows outside, drinks tea, smokes, chats and just sleeps on the streets. Maybe this does not happen in big towns he says but in villages as in smaller or medium-sized towns it does.\nThe girl told us that she is missing the Korean street food a lot. Once she tried out a Korean street food market here in Berlin, but did not like it. She went there with some friends, to chat, meet new people and have some good Korean food but it ended up being too expensive, there was even an entrance fee and the food was just not good. In Korea she always used to eat outside with her friends. Cooking was a family thing; eating out was for all other social events.\nAfter those interviews we talked about the \u201cBerlin Thaipark\u201d, were mostly Thai women sell homemade southeast Asian dishes on their blankets more or less being tolerated by the bureaucracy; about a great project by the New York based designer Candy Chang called Street vendor guide where she visualizes the most commonly violated rules in this context for the vendors themselves; and asked ourselves: How can we enable migrants to integrate the interactive food customs / traditions they like and bring from their culture of origin into Berlins community life?\nLater on one of our fellow students told us the following:\nA group of Syrian refugees mentioned the huge summer barbecues they would always have in summertime back in Syria: a lot of friends, family, a lot of food, somewhere in the nature, in a park. When being asked if they are doing similar activities here in summertime they deny. They think that it is forbidden to have a barbecue anywhere outside and do not want to act against the law seen their uncertain status. Still they miss them.\nThat basically is how we ended up facing the design question already mentioned above: How can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extent, because they do not know what activities are legal in these spaces and are afraid to act against the law?\nSo far we, a group of 4 university students, call our little project A Taste of Home and would be more than happy about any comments.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 22:34:58", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 22:34:58", "tag_id": 449, "post_id": 683, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 650}, {"id": 6303, "text": null, "quote": "How can we integrate non-germans by motivating germans to teach them more about their culture / lenguage?\nInspiration:", "created_at": "2017-02-28 01:30:53", "updated_at": "2017-02-28 01:30:53", "tag_id": 449, "post_id": 504, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 471}, {"id": 6304, "text": null, "quote": "Alkasem: i have question to all of you: where are the families of the homeless people?

The river is the most sacred Hindu and Buddhist river in Nepal and its banks border the holiest Hindu temples and several UNESCO heritage sites. Yet, it is the most polluted river in Nepal. The Bagmati River is also a prime example of how adversely climate change can affect a community while, at the same time, highlighting the resiliency and commitment of the residents to continue the fight to mend their river. The importance of the river to the people of Nepal and residents of Kathmandu had resulted in inspiring city-wide community events that have tried to restore the sacred waters. While their efforts are admirable and have motivated government action, little has been done to mitigate climate change causes or to adapt communities to their present conditions or to future projections. The proposed book, documentary and related programming connects the science of water quality and climate change to effects of urban migration, social norms, economics, industrial development, and government policies. The book will also investigate how the river\u2019s condition has affected religious rituals and culture. The inclusion of interviews and artwork by professional artists whose work deals with the Bagmati River will provide a unique visual perspective on Kathmandu\u2019s cultural connection to the river. While the issues investigated are specific to Nepal and the Kathmandu Valley, the general causes of the pollution, degradation of the water and its connection to climate change is reflective of many rivers and communities throughout the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through aesthetically-interesting and related imagery, maps, and graphs, we hope to provide a new perspective on the interconnectedness of science, economics, environmentalism, health issues and art as it relates to the complexities of clean accessible water and the related social issues.

In this initiative, \u201cAlliance Fran\u00e7oise\u201d and CounterFoto being our strategic partners supported along with their venues.\nCase studies:\nI do believe that they are \u201cDifferently Abled\u201d and this terminology brings the positive vibe\u00a0\u00a0 and disability is at the end about our mindset and exclusion free society is important through more engagement and employment but still struggling for inclusion. We successfully ended our\u00a0 year along with participation in\u201d Social Enterprise Day\u201d,29 th December 2015 powered by British Council and facilitated by \u201c Better Stories\u201d at their official venue. From that venture, we felt more motivated to engage them while creating a space for their income generation. After that, we initiated more activities towards arts and crafts, with a successful art exhibition at the residence of Netherlands Embassy, May 2016. We got more opportunity to interact with the creative people and one of our artists Muhammad Sohel Ahmed got the opportunity to start his career as graphics designer at \u201cRed and Orange\u201d communication ,before him it was another deaf and mute youth who bagged a job in a local advertising media, DOT3PRD, who is Shafayth Hossain Asif (23) working as a graphics designer in advertising media.\n\u00a0\nJannatul Ferdous Srity (23) another deaf and mute female artist, who worked as an intern along with a national NGO, Democracywatch. Mashiat Tanin (22) another artist is studying at the University of Development Alternative.\nOur targeted stakeholders\nWe felt these spaces and inclusion for the differently abled would be the biggest challenge for our foundation and that is what has become a driven factor to start this new initiative to create a\u00a0 space for deaf and mute artists for their income\u00a0 generation along with the collaboration with the Embassies. As the head of Chancery Mr. Tanvir Kabir\u00a0 from Bangladesh High Commission in Mexico\u00a0 bought the deaf and mute artists paintings and an exhibition was held in Mexico City as well. The thing is still now the popularization of\u00a0 buying paintings and it\u2019s customers are limited, so we are focusing on more innovative design according to the demand of the market and apart from paining, we are also selling wool made products, handmade potteries and miniature arts as well through the online page of \u201cMagical Art of Silence\u201d. That is the new initiative when we started our\u00a0 offline journey from January 13 th onwards at MIB ( Winter Meet Up Exhibit).\n\u00a0\nConclusion :\nWe do hope that more national and international NGOs, embassies would come forward to collaborate with us to promote their artwork through diary, desk calendar as well as via web pages and social networking as well.", "created_at": "2017-05-22 19:05:06", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 19:05:06", "tag_id": 464, "post_id": 838, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 805}, {"id": 6365, "text": null, "quote": "After our first initiative we are really enthusiastic for our future endeavors as we participated in a workshop based on \u201cTheater for Differently Able\u201d which is funded by British Council Bangladesh along with an expert from U.K, Jeany Sealy\u00a0 who herself is a deaf and also one of the organizers of London Paralympics. We are hopeful as the entire project is entitled\u00a0\u201cA different Shakespeare\u201d, and all the actors and actresses are differently able, being deaf or physically immovable. It was neither a barrier nor limitation from being in performing arts in terms of being deaf and wheel chair users, losing any part of limbs but at the end being able to express in the way you are and this time the maximum participants were selected from BRIDGE foundation.\nWe finished a boot camp based on \u2018From Sign Language to C++\u201d based on Programming for Differently Able and especially for deaf\u00a0\u00a0 and the targeted group was around 14-18 with the help of two young, enthusiastic undergrads who worked as trainer on voluntary basis. BRIDGE foundation itself is consisted with all the youth volunteers and state department alumnus who are spirited for the community betterment; community based services, youth and civic engagement as well as future leaders of Green Earth campaign.\nIn 2015 December we ,the BRIDGE Foundation initiated the project \u201cARTPreneur for Differently Able Young Deaf Artists\u201d where they do have opportunities to work under the experts through monthly basis workshop and selling their art work through online as well. In this first initiative \u201cAlliance Fran\u00e7oise\u201d supported us along with their in house artists and also CounterFoto supported us along with their venue where famous artist \u201cNajib Tareque\u201d came as guest lecturer and we do believe that they are the \u201cDifferently Able\u201d and this a terminology that brings the positive vibe and disability is at the end all about our mind set and exclusion free society is important through more engagement and employment.\nWe successfully ended our\u00a0 year along with participation in\u201d Social Enterprise Day\u201d,29 th December 2015 powered by British Council and facilitated by \u201c Better Stories\u201d at their official venue.\nThe special cases of physically disable students who are less in number as we expected that we would also be able to accommodate the wheel chair users along with ramp but at the end they could not make it due to support from their parents and distance, where we found we would have special session along with the guardian and parents also. Female Participation is required to be increased through consultation and motivation to find out their feasibility and access in future.\nLast but not least we do urge to every activist and volunteer to support us being actively engaged as a volunteer through BRIDGE Foundation and work for the excluded group through sharing, teaching and capacity building being a facilitator for each and every differently able to be touched through voice, through your eyes, your touchy fingers, extended and helping hands and valuable time at the end. Mainstream has been done, has been doing and will be doing but what about excluded, scheduled and out stream people?\u00a0if we don\u2019t listen to voice of silence, to make the immovable a movable one through IT, technology and information which can lessen the gap of \u201cDigital Divide\u2019 and can ensure \u201cDifferently Able in Development \u201cwith a positive notion instead of \u201cDisable in Development\u201d the Sustainable and inclusive development will be a myth only. At the end I do believe you are not disabled unless you\u00a0believe that and I am hopeful that the government initiated the strategies of inclusion for the \u201cDifferently Able\u201d even though that are in the limited era but this is the beginning.

I rarely post about someone while they are alive if it is not to share something they themselves intended for public consumption.

I ask myself what effect this has on the dynamics of grief, which are slow and\u00a0somehow not very condusive to selling anything - except for membership in cults or possibly self-help literature.\nIn my parents cultures grief is a shared experience, there are a lot of social rituals for processing it have written about it in\u00a0Life and Death at the UnMonastery. I recently came across something called Sunday Assembly. They have set up a secular equivalent to the sunday sermons at church to address the lack of spaces for social communion and other\u00a0rituals which are key to cementing strong communities. Somehow I feel social media can be used to grow these kinds of movements and to connect a critical mass of people to them.

I consider myself privileged to be born into a comfortable middle class life, to have a supportive family and friends, no academic problems. In theory, I was supposed to be happy. So why was I feeling so paralysed and helpless? Considering there are so many people who have it much worse than me, feeling sad seemed irrational, unjustified and shameful.\nEveryone around me seemed to manage just fine, effortlessly juggling scholastic and social expectations. So I thought it must be my fault that I was barely holding it together. I was ashamed to admit that I was struggling and ask for help. When I finally gathered enough courage to talk openly about my problems with my friends and family members, I was stunned how much it resonated. Once I had shared my troubles, many of them would admit some of their own. These were people that I had known for more than 10 years, people that I thought I knew inside out, suddenly telling me about insecurities of theirs that I never even suspected them to have. Such moments of connection were a very special experience.\nHowever, at times it was also exhilarating. It's not easy for either party.\u00a0Opening up, even to the people I trust most,\u00a0took a great deal of mental effort. Then, I didn\u2019t know how to properly express what I felt. And they didn\u2019t know how to react. I didn\u2019t know what kind of reaction I was hoping for. I didn\u2019t want to burden or worry anyone. How often did I find myself alone in my room bawling my eyes out, finally calling my mother or my best friend, just to hang up 5 minutes later even more frustrated and miserable and guilty than before. They were only trying to help me to the best of their abilities, but somehow all well-meant compliments and advice only made me feel worse. I didn\u2019t think they could truly understand me and it was so difficult to communicate what I wanted to say, when I didn't even\u00a0really know what that was myself. When they tried to relate their own experiences to mine, it felt like they were comparing a broken arm to a papercut. When they were trying to give me tips on health and well-being, it felt patronizing, as if I didn\u2019t know and try that already. This was nothing that doing a round of Yoga or 8 hours of sleep or being more social could simply \u2018fix\u2019. Just thinking such things added to my guilt and shame, because it was like I was taking their attempts of help for granted. Devils circle.\nWhat helped me most in the end wasn\u2019t necessarily talking about anything in those situations. Discussing these things with a neutral person such as a therapist was a much better framework for me to sort out my thoughts without the added complications of emotional attachment. The greatest help for me was just someone being there and giving me a hug. Telling me that they know it sucks and just sharing a little bit of the suckiness in that moment.\nEDIT:\nHow do\u00a0you deal\u00a0with emotional issues?

The main differentiator wrt such scenarios would/could (mainly) be the user-interface.\nIn the simplest\u00a0case, the device could be programmed (by a physician, physiotherapist etc.) in order to mimic/repeat a predefined set of motions over and over again in order, for example, to avoid the undesired consequences of limbs immobilization (contractures, poor blood circulation etc).\nIn a rehab setting, for example post-stroke, the exoskeleton's motions could be derived by decoding user's intention via physiological signals (mainly EEG, EMG). In this case the basic idea would be to allow the user to complement or slowly re-gain control over his flaccid/weak arm and discontinue its use once the user does not need it any longer.\nIn an assistive setting, for example post spinal cord injury or in myopathies, the exoskeleton's motions could be derived as before or chosen from a simple interface (e.g. smartphone, joysticks etc.) in order to provide assistance-as-needed, whenever the user wears\u00a0the device.\nIn a case like the one you've mentioned the device could indeed be used, not to help but rather to (selectively) resist the movements.

It was organized C-Mine Genk, an innovation laboratory in the old coalmines of the Flemish region of Limburg. I got selected as one of the finalist for my solution for a solution for the intergenerational gab, commonly known as the kids that don\u2019t visit grandma anymore because she is to old\u2026\nFor my solution I started by looking at the obvious part: intergenerational contact is good for the health of the elderly and also good for the development of the kids on multiple levels. So what was missing is a tool that brought them together.\nI grew up in a rather unconventional setting for people of my generation and later (90s kids like the internet would say) My parents and i shared the house with an elderly woman that wasn\u2019t my grandmother but the godmother of my dad. She was rather cultivated woman with brought knowledge about geography, literature and history. She helped me out on my schoolwork and we shared our interest in reading the news. When she started having difficulties to move out of the house, I helped her staying young by introducing her to the then new technology called DVD and PS2. We played bowling on the Wii and if she would have stayed around longer, I\u2019m sure she would have used my tablet. In opposite to my grandmother who was visiting us every week, my \u2018m\u00e9m\u00e9\u2019 stayed young in her head, and i think it was patly thanks to our dayle exchanges. She would learn me about history and i would learn her about technology.\n\u00a0\nSo when designing my idea i took this story and tried to create the mechanisms that made it work and what was needed to scale up. I found that people where already implementing wii\u2019s in elderly homes to give them exercise. While this is a good idea for them to exercise, the intergenerational part was still missing. So how could we create a game where kids needed to come to the elderly without them having the feeling it was a burden?\nWell you know those games on your phone where you need to do repetitive tasks to go up levels to beat new monsters, like 99% of all mechanics of Role Playing Games? Why not extrude those mechanics of training to the elderly. Give them exercises they can do all day to gain skill points. Arm movements will help the Atk stat for example, Balance will help Def stat and so on. The twist is that the kids playing the game will need to go physically to the elderly to get their little guy leveed up. Want to beat a new boss, but you miss some skillpoint, well go to one of the elderly homes where they play the game and go talk with them. Maybe the first time the discussion will be pure mechanical, but when returning a bound will be created between the people and discussions will be about more then only the game. You have to see it as an incentive to bring people together.\nAfter presenting this project i finished third and got 500 euro\u2019s to spend on material for the project.

It was a place where ideals could grow, and people could come listen to each other in an open dialogue. I started working on an open call to repurpose the empty Bourse building into a new Maison Du Peuple, right in the hearth of the city. But just days after finishing the text the attacks in Bataclan occurred and life in Brussels changed dramatically for a couple of weeks\u2026\nI gave it a rest and set my focus on a vacant building above the well-known music bar Bonnefooi: 4 floors, 500m2, and lots of potential, but also lots of work to be done. Without any budget or action plan, I started gathering people in the house, now called Huis VDH. The only thing I knew was that I wanted an inclusive project build from a common idea: Designing a semi-public space in such a way that the wellbeing of the neighbourhood / city improves. Huis VDH will therefore become a test case, because it isn\u2019t the first or last vacant space above a shop in Brussels: there are more than 23 000 m2 documented.\nSo there we were, having a space, an open concept and a lot of potential. The first thing we did was taking time to create a common practice: we designed our way of gathering through a futurism session created by Fo.AM that allowed us to gather all ideas from each person who wanted to get involved and, like a funnel, filter only the most common. For us, it was important to make Huis VDH as open as possible, so that any new member with the right mind-set could easily become a full involved partner in the building process. After a philosophical six months, we had the sprout of an idea: Huis VDH was born.\nIt\u2019s all in the name, for Huis VDH it is no other. \u2018Huis\u2019 means \u2018home\u2019 in Dutch and that is what we are aiming to become for people that are drowning in a sea of complexity of city life. We try to not judge each other, but rather think solution oriented: Help out where we can, and bring the right people around the table. Our space is designed to welcome each kind of small organization working on local issues: cultural, social or technological. We try to design each space so it can be multifunctional and become a temporary rest spot for thosein search of an anchor. We believe like edgeryders: \u201c that the power of a community is bigger than the sum of all parts.\u201d\nOne big challenge we will be facing in the next couple of years is to use our talent to organize ourselves within crisis. Big problems are ahead and we need to build up resilience to react quickly to an ever changing surrounding. Huis VDH is trying to take that challenge inside our own development. For us resilience can be developed on four levels: knowledge, vulnerability, out of the box exercise, and modification.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 21:26:22", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 21:26:22", "tag_id": 485, "post_id": 520, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 487}, {"id": 12835, "text": "", "quote": "Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3)", "created_at": "2017-11-28 18:46:55.333071", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:41.929476", "tag_id": 2823, "post_id": 1497, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1464}, {"id": 12836, "text": "", "quote": "Network Society", "created_at": "2017-11-28 18:47:07.443298", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:41.998240", "tag_id": 2831, "post_id": 1497, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1464}, {"id": 12837, "text": "", "quote": "Rural Development", "created_at": "2017-11-28 18:47:17.395253", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:42.006385", "tag_id": 2832, "post_id": 1497, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1464}, {"id": 6475, "text": null, "quote": "Epoxy is not cheap (unless it is a day over shelf life - ask around at boat builders or wind power manufacturers, perhaps in Rostock) but it can get a lot of stuff done.

As a good boy I stated: \"When I grow up mom, I\u2019ll invent a cleaning robot to do the job for you\". Someone beat me to it - the cleaning robot is a reality - it sells well, and substitutes the socializing cleaning woman once offered to the elderly. I see now that a cleaning robot is not what a mother really wants. She just wants a good boy saying: \u201cmom, I'll do that part of the cleaning with you\u201d, and do it right away.\nUntil doing my masters, the disabled people were an unknown phenomenon to me. They were not seen, not talked about. I was introduced to young people suddenly wheelchair bound with very limited personal independence due to a spinal cord injury. \u00a0They were really nice people and kindly explained about the complexity of such sudden change in abilities and about the need to regain some functional movements.\nFirst of all they told me where my ideas were no good and what research needed to be done. Together we coined a method, not an ambitious cure, just a simple idea that could help a bit and during my Ph.D dissertation, we demonstrated feasibility of restoring the hand function using electrical activation of the paralysed muscles. Not a fits all solution and not perfect, but as people say: when you have nothing, a little is a lot, and for some people it works well (see the video)\nWe still research in restoration of walking in paraplegic patients and quite a few assistive devices have been marketed (braces, functional electrical stimulation and robots ).\nI have been active in the field for 20 years working at major rehabilitation institutions, but I\u2019ve only rarely seen patients being offered these assistive technologies and more rarely seen them \u00a0used outside the hospital. Is the problem (as some people with SCI have entrusted me) that there is no such demand or \u2018new hope\u2019 for walking? After all, wheels are more efficient than legs - provided accessibility!!!\nAnother hypothesis could be an issue of lack of flexibility of the healthcare system, not beeing able to provide state of the art technology to patients !?\nStill, for more than forty years we continue producing scientific publications with conclusions like: \u201c\u2026the work carried out so far proves that functional movements can be restored...We therefore believe that patients can benefit. Further research should be carried out\u201d.\nPlease, don\u2019t get me wrong. The research contribute with important results, but obviously there is a problem of transferring the research results into the benefit of people with physical challenges.\nSo far business oriented people responds that it\u2019s because the solutions are not technically good enough, that they only fit a few thousand patients and we continue the research for enhancements to the technology and demonstrate clinically effectiveness.\nOn the other hand less ambitious solutions have been available since the 60\u2019ties, to alleviate the simple problem of foot drop. It applies to thousands of people living with stroke, multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. It\u2019s a little electrical device providing electrical impulses to the muscle that lifts the foot and I\u2019ve encountered many people with stroke and multiple sclerosis who gained significantly in mobility (see this user statement).\nDespite demonstrated clinical efficiency and the immediate advantages it\u2019s almost never proposed to the patients of the health care system (except for the UK [11]). Why???\nSo on the one hand we spend million dollar research to refine technology that is not widely used!!!!. Will our institutions and society implement the provision of such technology!?\nThey need one solution that fits many, because the modern health care model reduce human life in cost/benefit analysis to numbers. However, as long as assistive technology is not used it\u2019s difficult to identify exactly where to improve it. \u00a0We know that consumers must be involved early in the development, it\u2019s difficult to do so in a realistic setting. We realize that marketing assistive technology is different than selling a robot vacuum cleaner.\nSo a relatively simple method of restoring the hand function in people having broken their neck (cervical spinal cord injury), that has been demonstrated useful in a large clinical trial has not become available to people who really need it because it does not fit the \u2018business model\u2019 \u00a0of modern health care systems !?\nAs an example we experienced that half the participants wanted to take the experimental device with them home. We are not allowed to do that. I\u2019ve only spend around 50 euro to build the prototype in the laboratory, but we are not in the 1970\u2019ies anymore. In the name of assuring \u2018quality\u2019, \u2018safety\u2019 etc, \u00a0we need to manufacture, CE mark, register as a medical device and so on!. \u00a0To provide a patient with a medical device we need to spend hundreds of thousands of euros on paperwork!!! And who is then going to sell at a reasonable price. \u00a0Why should people, already challenged economically by loss of health, spend 5-10 k\u20ac \u00a0for a device that could be made much cheaper?\nThat\u2019s where the revolution of OpenCare \u2013with a subset of community driven provision of assistive technology - comes in.\nCould we leave people with a physical handicap to become a maker, create their own assistive technology?\nWould it be possible for, for example, researchers to help people living with a disability to hack a dropped foot correcting device like connecting an Arduino with an extension board?\nWill doctors provide indications of how to find the assistive technology, which might solve your health issue?\nThat would mean that people should take responsibility for their own rehabilitation devices. They would have full ownership. Clearly they must be guided by healthcare professionals and experts without conflict of interests to ensure that everything is done ethically, safe and sound. How?\nMaybe if we reunite people living with physical challenges with researchers they would both benefit and research becomes action and functionally useful to the society?\nWhat do you think?", "created_at": "2017-02-11 02:19:24", "updated_at": "2017-02-11 02:19:24", "tag_id": 485, "post_id": 516, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 483}, {"id": 6479, "text": null, "quote": "After a very long research phase me and my team from Newcomer now have conceptualized a smartphone-app, which familiarizes not only refugees but any newcomers with their environment.

Both drinks are half priced so they get in contact by using this discound. With a growing community different app-users could match and meet to solve tasks together and have a nice experience.\nSo our app definitely is no tourist guide.

After graduation, I spent years working for French and international industrial companies, after which I quit and went on to work in the humanitarian field throughout Southeast Asia. With the arrival of new technologies and the community approach using the Internet to connect people, it became clear to me that there are now widespread and relatively cheap tools of empowerment readily available. Upon my return to Europe, I decided to work on the development of such ideas. This led to the inception of the echOpen project.\nThe idea started from a chat among friends, an engineer (Luc) previously employed in the ultrasound industry, a mathematician and physician (Mehdi) and a radiologist (Pierre). We discussed smartphones: widespread devices that are more sophisticated than the computers that sent people to the moon a few decades ago.\nHow could we use this technology to improve health care, considering that now almost everyone have one in his/her pocket?\nThis idea emerged as a combination of our passion for open technology and community engagement. Using technologies that have existed since the 70s,with a bit of tweaking, are cheap and perfectly functional to make this idea come true. We then give access to these tools and knowledge to anyone interested, and to encourage them to try new things out.\nThis is how our mission came about. We plan to develop the very first Open Source, affordable ultrasound probe (echo-stethoscope) dedicated to diagnosis orientation, based on open source hardware and software principles. It will be cheaper than any of the fancy machines you can find on the market. There already are some ultraportable ultrasound scanners out there, but they cost several thousand Euros \u00a0our goal is to divide the price by 10-15 times. This device will be able to produce a medical image that you can then transport to your smartphone or laptop. It\u2019s a device that every health care professional will want to carry in their pocket - allowing for faster and more accurate diagnosis orientation, which means faster and better medical care. As a preventive tool, it will reduce the number of patients who need emergency help. It can save the lives of mothers who die in developing countries during their pregnancies. Our tool will also spark more interactions between professionals and patients.\nWe launched the project in late 2014, but the actual work really began in August 2015. Hosted by the hospital Hotel Dieu, right next to the Notre Dame in Paris, we have an open space with an interesting, eclectic ecosystem of researchers, community members, senior professionals working in the technical and medical areas of ultrasound technology, radiologists, experts in echography, medical laboratories, universities, and schools, etc.\nEarlier this year, we developed a functional prototype of the tool - it works, but the quality of the image is not satisfactory. With the involvement of more than 200 people, mostly from France but also in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, we are now improving the quality of echOpen. Our deadline to complete the new medical-quality prototype is this December.\nOur project has been supported by the Fondation Pierre Fabre, which believes in our approach and that our concept could be used in Africa, where doctors lack medical imaging devices. They provide financial support and other resources - and the more we have, the faster and more efficiently we can do our work.\n\nWe are constantly looking for both funding and new profiles to get involved within the community, anyone from developers, to designers, engineers, legal experts, and community managers.

The initial goal was to create free software with education and academic programs embedded into it, which would be accessible to remote areas in Latin America for example (I have worked there for many years). \n\u00a0\nThe longer I worked in some of the poorer countries, the better I understood that the pressing need is actually more basic - kids need good nutrition before they can go to school. And the ever present reductionist Model of Disease has to be changed into a holistic System of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. There are various reasons why countries fail at providing the best care possible: too much privatization, too much technology supplanting good, basic policies. Doctors being more drug sellers than anything else. Omnipresent micro-specialization, which pushes medicine even more towards seeing a person as particular organs instead of a whole, complex, bio-psicho-social-spiritual being. \n\u00a0\nAnd so we shifted towards the creation of the System of Health, a system that would integrate care providers, institutions, individuals. A system rooted in the idea of Social and Integrative Medicine, which promotes education, good nutrition, family affection, physical exercise, and sanitary housing conditions, along with the state of the art innovations in the areas of precision medicine, (epi)genetics, bioinformatics, as the best and most sustainable public policies one can make. With this concept in mind, \u00a0GNU Health (any pronunciation is OK, but I like the concept of \"new\") was born in 2008.\n\u00a0\nA little bit later, GNU took its recent shape of The Free Health and Hospital Information System, which is available in a form of wiki - dynamic as the health (care) itself and consistently updated. It can be installed and used by hospitals, governments, institutions, under a free license. As health and care are parts of a complex, multi-etiological and anthropological issues, the system we\u2019ve created allows management and analysis of a huge amount of data and aspects: \n\n\nIndividual and community management: demographics, domiciliary units, families, operational areas and sectors, ...\n \n\nPatient management: Socioeconomics, lifestyle, encounters / evaluations, hospitalizations, lab reports, genetics, clinical history, ...\n \n\nHealth center management: Finances, stock, pharmacy , laboratory, Dx imaging, beds, operating rooms, appointments, supply chain management, human resources, \u2026\n \n\nInformation management: Reporting, Demographics and Epidemiology\n \n\n\u00a0\nAccess to this information and ability to interpret and understand it is a precondition to an effective (health) care system, and it has to complement the work of nurses, teachers, mothers and fathers, social workers and doctors\u2026 Our role is to provide these institutions with a system capable of handling and processing huge amounts of data, and based on these findings - craft optimized prevention and deploy effective teams to tackle challenges. Our maps, for example, can show in real time spots in which the outbreaks of dengue happens, allowing for fast reaction. But it does much more than that - it shows the relations between health and family violence and teenage pregnancy. It underlines social determinants. It grasps the relations between economy and well-being. \n\u00a0\nLater on, we have added more functionalities, for example, Universal Patient\u2019s ID that supports centralisation of information about a person - this way you\u2019re not a new patient to each one of your doctors, but your story is accessible to health professionals.The ID does not allow the duplication of either individuals or patient medical history at the health center. On the upcoming features, the GNU Health Federation, will allow to aggregate information coming from multiple contexts, and \n\u00a0\nGNU Health is, in fact, a philosophy. It is about multidisciplinary communities with various tasks that contribute to more effective, more empathetic, more patient and health-oriented care. It\u2019s about a new mindset and a new attitude of health professionals, whose work cannot be efficient without a human approach to the patients and a deep understanding of their condition. Nutrition, exercise, prevention, information, empathy, affection, family, hygiene, education, technology, housing conditions - these and many more aspects have to be taken care of and supplement each other. \n\u00a0\nThe system is being used in various places. In Argentina and Laos, it has been implemented by neurological and trauma rehabilitation and centers a few years ago. It is being installed in Argentina in districts to manage primary health centers. The Ministry of Health of Morelos, Mexico for the province. The biggest hospital in Laos, a reference in tropical diseases, runs on it as well. The government of Jamaica started a couple of years ago the implementation project for managing the Public Health system of the island.\n\u00a0\nThese institutions and countries are independent now from proprietary solutions, which should be the integral principle in health care. Their work and experience help to improve the community. It\u2019s a lot of solidarity, equity and community work as a result. And they\u2019re free from external vendors, institutions, licenses, they can modify the modules and create new ones - for example, the module dealing with Injury Surveillance System was built in response to the needs in Jamaica. \n\u00a0\nMoney helps us move faster, but it\u2019s the people who make us achieve really remarkable things.

Hopefully it gives you a peek inside the very personal experience of being part of a sort of grand thing \u2013 a network of people becoming active in the healthcare provision chain and caring for each other despite not having met. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nNoemi: Introduce us to the time when the cytostatics network came about. Was someone ill able or unable to access treatment from healthcare providers? How did they go by?\nSabina: It was the fall of 2009 when it all started for me: the dizziness, the fatigue, trouble breathing, walking, doing\u00a0 basically anything. In October, I just put it on my crazy life style: mother of two, finishing the PhD, teaching at the Music University.\n\u00a0In November it was clear something else was going on. So I went to a private lab- the thought of a state hospital was too scary- and had a blood work done. Except it did not work the usual way: the results could not be read due to a strange characteristic of the sample.\nI knew it was a bad sign, so I turned to my adoptive grandmother, dr. Mirjam Bercovici. She figured it out in minutes, wrote me a recommendation letter and sent me to a real hospital. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia \u2013 a very rare blood disease- was confirmed and three years of fighting it in Romania and Austria followed.\nHow did she know and how does this relate to the problems of cytostatics in Romania?\nFor many years, Mirjam, a hematologist, was the chief of the Pediatric Department in the oncologic ward of the biggest hospital in Romania: Fundeni. She was now long retired, but still having nightmares about kids who could not be saved. Because, you see, even though the treatment had clear indications about when and how to give the medicines, they were not always available. The doctors in her section did miracles. Curing cancer without the necessary drugs is indeed a miracle. The always missed some important dose, they could not offer the kids the standard treatment their colleagues in the West were used to. It was the communist era and everything was very difficult, even for the most important health care center in the country.\nSo when she sent me there, she knew that I would receive the best possible care, but she was also aware of the limitations of a poor system, as populated with amazing doctors as it was.\nDuring my time in Fundeni, I spent lots of time with people dealing with forms of blood cancer. I was \u201clucky\u201d: only had to buy once dexamethason\u00a0for myself, but they were not so lucky:\u00a0 either filling tones of papers to get the newest drugs (the usual line was: we are giving to you, but only with \u201dthe dossier\u201d), either they had to figure out how to obtain certain medication themselves.\nBut two bone morrow aspirations and numerous transfusions later, when my condition worsened, there were talks about a treatment\u00a0 reserved for Hodgkin's lymphoma, Mabthera, or Rituximab. Rituximab was not approved in AutoImmune Hemolytic Anemia in Romania at that time. It still isn\u2019t.\nWas anyone inside hospitals listening or fighting back?\nThe situation was rather strange. The drug was expensive, not approved for my AIHA, but\u00a0available in theory. My roommates\u00a0 with Lymphoma could get it based on the dossier (so not standard). But they were missing other drugs, cheaper cytostatics like Bleomicin, compensated 100% from the state! It was like in the times when Mirjam Bercovici was active, all over again. Like nothing had changed in 40 years. Frustration was working both sides, because treatments sessions were postponed, sick people and doctors being equally worried.\nAll I knew was that doctors advised patients to figure out how to get the drugs.

During this meeting we found out there are no digital devices to monitor the hand rehabilitation and we decided to develop one.\u00a0\nTo define our project we didn\u2019t started from a theoretical concept. We started to make the prototype and to test it.\u00a0\nThe development of reHub working prototype has been at the heart of our design process.\nAs described on www.rehub.pro, the definition of the prototype is subdivided into 4 time frames of research and development. The first steps of the team have moved in electronics and design.\nAfter testing the very first glove we decided to create an integrated system with a self-produced/maker pcb. Our design has always been oriented, and always will be, to integrate all electronics on the top of the glove. Another aspect of our prototype is that the glove itself must be comfortable for the patient. At a later time, once we knew that the glove was able to transmit data to the computer, we focused on the development of a software allowing patients and physiotherapists to evaluate the glove\u2019s collected data through a graphical interface and cartesian charts.\nWe are looking for our final user(s), who will try our product and help us develop different options:\n\nSport\nGaming\nEducational\nMedical \u00a0\n\nWe want to built a community and start a business strategy.\nWe will publish tutorials, kits and software to make your glove.\nEverything to improve the glove solution.\nWe want to develop 4 different kits to sell:\n\nwith single sensors\u00a0\nonly the electronics\nglove tailored\ncomplete of all\n components\n\nWebsites & Social\nwww.rehub.pro\nwww.facebook.com/rehubglove", "created_at": "2017-05-22 19:11:21", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 19:11:21", "tag_id": 485, "post_id": 33751, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6600}, {"id": 6507, "text": null, "quote": "August 2016, Breathing Games took part to the Open & Change Care application to MacArthur's Foundation.\nApril 2017, we were selected for a two-weeks residence in Milan, organized by EdgeRyders, WeMake and OpenCare.\nWe document our residence in following spaces.

A collision of honest and upfront conversations about existential experiences and a research of numerous solutions that had yet to be exploited in a certain context, rethinking their business models.\nAt this point, SoundSight was a completely new initiative. A virtual gym to train echolocation, and while the idea of features and UX design accumulated quickly, the team pursued a proof-of-concept and something that others could think of as a minimum viable product.\nThe first prototype was a mess. To the users invited to a test, it must have seemed unbelievable how a software engineer could have thought that a piece of software reverberating in a fixed environment and artificial sound would have been enough to suggest how the platform would work. Not to mention, a command line interface, and a rather lengthy procedure to change the position within the simulated environment. But thanks to the outgoing and always positive outlook of Irene, they never thought of disinvesting: SoundSight was an experience for them.\nThe team worked hectically on Irene\u2019s feedbacks, and a really workable proof-of-concept finally became available around Spring 2015.\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s leave it again to Irene\u2019s recollection:\nIrene: \u201cHello Mario[1], we are here again\u2026 this time I promise you will be impressed\u201d\nMario: \u201cHi Irene, it\u2019s a pleasure\u2026 and rest assured, last time I was already impressed, although maybe not as you hoped for\u2026 with my friends we have been laughing a lot about your engineer\u2019s idea of a prototype!\u201d\nIrene: \u201cOh no, Mario\u2026 don\u2019t abuse him, or who knows when we will find another person with the same talent and will to do something meaningful even with no immediate profit in sight! I am counting on you to keep certain things\u201d\nMario: \u201cDon\u2019t worry Irene, I have only told the story to one or two\u2026 hundreds of people\u2026 ahahah!\u201d\nIrene: \u201cDoh! \u2026ok Mario, then to pay you back, today\u2019s text will be extra tough!\u201d\nMario: \u201cI am ready for the challenge!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIrene sets up the simulation\n\u00a0\nIrene: \u201cOK Mario, it\u2019s ready. I would like to ask you to try the first round without me sharing with you any information\u2026 I want you to focus on your impressions only, tell me how it feels\u201d\nMario: \u201clet\u2019s start\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe simulation is run, Mario is moved to several places in a cathedral in this virtual world, and listens to the echoes of a tongue click\n\u00a0\nMario: \u201cIndeed there have been a lot of improvements, it is smooth now\u2026 last time it was a bit of an annoyance to have to wait for so long every time you wanted to move the position. However, listening to a prerecorded tongue click\u2026 are you sure these are simulations?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cYes Mario\u2026 we know it still requires a bit of imagination, but I assure you this is a real time simulation. Later during the tests, I will offer you the possibility to move the position arbitrarily, and you should notice it. It is definitely on our list of priorities to introduce real-time input of user generated tongue clicks\u2026 we are just not there yet\u2026 you are one of our very early testers, and I cannot thank you enough for that\u201d\nMario: \u201cDon\u2019t, I enjoy this experience, and I really like the concept. Somehow contributing to its realization makes me proud. However, you need my honest opinions, and I think the ability to exploit the user\u2019s own tongue click will improve the experience terrifically. I have realized that you have made me move through wide and small environments\u2026 but I haven\u2019t been able to identify where I was.\u201d\nIrene: \u201cThat\u2019s already quite good Mario! I have only given you one point for each environment, and you have already been able to tell something about them\u2026 you are the best! We will focus on learning curves and performances later again, can you tell me anything else about your general impressions at the moment?\u201d\nMario: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell you more from just this\u2026 maybe we can move to the next exercise?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cYes, here we go. Get ready, and now I will let you walk through the environment of today, and you will hear repeated clicks\u2026 try to guess what it would be\u201d\nJust a quick run of the new scenario on the simulator\nMario: \u201chmmm\u2026 the smoothness has improved a lot\u2026 but I really could not tell you what it is. It seems a large environment, I have been getting away from a wall and after getting closer to another?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cI had told you would not have an easy life, after those jokes about our engineer Mario! But you did quite well. It was a cathedral\u2026 now that I have told you, could you confirm it or would you still be doubtful?\u201d\nMario: \u201cLet me try to listen again\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2026the simulator runs again shortly\nMario: \u201cYes Irene, now that I know, it could well be\u2026 I had some doubts, with no context it could have been a theater or a large gym, \u2026\u201d\nIrene: \u201cIndeed\u2026 now I would like you to do a few exercises\u2026 I will tell you this time what you are going to listen to, precisely, and you will have to focus on the features\u2026 later there will be a test\u2026\u201d\nMario: \u201cFor me or for the software?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cFor both, Mario, don\u2019t try to escape your responsibilities\u201d\nMario: \u201cAhahah\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey run the training set\nMario: \u201cWell Irene, we will see how I perform later\u2026 but you should consider developing an interface to feed information about structures, volumes, and positions, directly to your users\u2026 it is nice to chat with you, but if you really think of this as a tool for making echolocation training accessible to anyone, the fact that you need to have by your side another person as your interface to the system doesn\u2019t add up\u201d\nIrene: \u201cYou are right. Together with the real-time acquisition of users\u2019 clicks, this interface is at the top of our list of priorities. We are thinking of using a simple tablet of mechanically executed needles to offer a map of the space being tested and a natural interface\u2026 or some haptic 3D interface, but that may be more expensive and complicated. We have not yet looked into that enough\u201d\nMario: \u201cYou would need a lot of needles to offer a useful interface\u2026 you can try prototyping something quick maybe with Arduino\u2026 but I would be a lot more curious about the haptic interface. I have seen some applications with holograms and they looked impressive.\u201d\nIrene: \u201cWe will keep this in mind. Of course, we need to make it as simple and cheap as possible, but still functional\u2026 and we hope the prices of that hardware will be democratized soon. Now that we have taken a small break\u2026\u201d\nMario: \u201cWhat break? Are you not letting me off yet?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cMario, let\u2019s just take the test before the coffee\u2026 I will let you off then, for today\u201d\nMario: \u201cOk, ok\u2026 a no is not possible anyway, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cIt\u2019s always possible, but I will insist with a smile\u201d\nThey run the tests\nIrene: \u201dif we compare today\u2019s performances to those from the last tests, both with the software and in the lab with the moving panels, you have really gotten better Mario!\u201d\nMario: \u201cBut Irene, how can I be sure if I have truly learned? I mean\u2026 we should arrange tests where there are coupled with some sort of benchmark\u2026 maybe similar tests in real world, you could imagine a mobile lab to do so\u2026 or even just arrange competitions among users\u201d\nIrene: \u201cThat\u2019s a really good idea, Mario! We will seriously reflect on how to arrange this, but for the time being\u2026 do you think your partner would like to try it out against you?\u201d\nMario: \u201cBut she sees\u2026\u201d\nIrene: \u201cit should not be an advantage, and I promise you I will not show her the screen\u201d\nThis is now a different story\u2026 but after being initially baffled, Mario\u2019s partner took it to her heart to seriously compete with him, and in the end, she won one of the tests, confirming anyone can learn this skill.\n1\u00a0Please be reminded that Mario is a blind guy.

The glove designed for proprioceptive rehabilitation and to recover movement fluidity after an injury.\u00a0 It allows the patient to record and report exercises, data- such as hand position and fingertips pressure.\nIn 2014 Sara\u00a0Savian\u00a0and Mauro Alfieri started their journey with a \u201ctest on sensors \u201cand they had presented their first prototype at the Arduino User Group & Wearables community at WeMake. The purpose for this to share projects, knowledge and create discussions on Arduino and Wearables and smart textiles.\u00a0 The intent was to explore how it can be used? How can it add value and be of use socially?\u00a0 What could be built on this foundation? These discussions could change the course for many participants.\nSara and Mauro not only had many questions answered, but they left with the idea of going back to the drawing board and creating something that would be beneficial to society.\nA conversation between a physiotherapist and someone suffering from hand disability created inquiry for Sara and Mauro. They exchanged and shared thoughts on their project, how could it be of use and that led to further discussion. It was the trigger point for them and a stepping stone for their project. We can\u2019t capture every discussion that took place as dialogue is woven into many discussions. But this one interaction planted the seed for what is now reHub.\n\u00a0We asked Sara to recollect this conversation:\nJohn: \"I suffer from a hand disability that limits my activities of daily life. Self-sufficiency is greatly reduced and hinders the quality of life for me. Constant monitoring of my movements and joints must be done frequently to evaluate my progress by and going back and forth as an outpatient for evaluations. This interferes with my daily activities\u201d*\nPhysiotherapist: \u201cThere has been an advancement in technologies in the rehabilitation to help patients achieve maximum recovery outcomes. In Italy, physiotherapists have no access to digital tools to evaluate rehabilitative progress for hand movements. Having instant access to this therapy anytime would be greatly beneficial.*\nWe asked Sara and Mauro how this conversation altered the course for reHub.\nSara: \u201cThis made us re-evaluate our project in a variety of ways and prompted us to think in broader terms and combine the \"test on sensors\" with solving a problem. We know that there is a lot of learning that needs to be done when you put the device in the hands of people that are just things you would not expect\".\u00a0\nMauro: From this discussion, Sara and I saw the opportunity offer a solution and an experience of an emerging area of wearable technology together with the sensing technology and decided to create a device that could be delivered in a rehabilitation approach to support patients\u2019 and to monitor hand rehabilitation. From listening to challenges that are faced on a daily basis, and realizing how painful it is for the patient and family. We need to work with them to help co-create with us\u201d.\nWith the project in its early stage, Sara wanted to share this:\nSara: \u201cThere is much work to do including working with actual users and receiving their feedback. With the goal of making it open source, fully customizable and adaptable, a community of user is required. We are solving the problem of monitoring the progress of rehabilitation therapy and the people directly impacted must be included.\u201d\nWe asked what\u2019s next for reHub.\nSara: \"We know that rehabilitation is time-consuming and demotivating and we plan to change that with a reHub device to empower patients through their therapy. Rehabilitation is often costly, by making it open source, it\u2019s affordable and accessible for people who are living with limitation and this could drastically improve their mental well-being during the road of recovery\u201d. This will allow the vast majority of patients to be sent home with a rehabilitation program to practice on their smartphone or tablet.\"\nThe reHub team is taking a broad approach in this area and looking for users and a community that will benefit and help develop different options: sport, gaming, educational, medical.\nWhy is it important to work with the community to further develop reHub?\nSara: \"Spending time with a community, or patients that will benefit from what you\u2019re creating is looking at the problem in a human-centered way and it highlight\u2019s what\u2019s needed instead of just relying on responses to questions. Spending time with people in the area of use is a really important step in the design process. So we\u2019re back to the drawing board. We need to know what from the user's perspective so we can design with them in mind.\"\nCo-creation, it matters. There is the emotional and functional connection that people have to a medical device. As far as functional, understanding how people use things, what they need to get done daily. \u00a0When we think of medical devices we initially think of accuracy, consistency, making sure it delivers the expected results. These are crucial reasons why design should be human oriented.\nMauro Alfieri: \u201cWe thank all the physiotherapists we have had a chance to meet with \u00a0which could effectively confront the future of this project, orienting it to a continuous use in proprioceptive physiotherapy.\"\nIf people can\u2019t achieve expected results due to a design issue or flaw, then that\u2019s obviously going to have a clinical impact. From a functional aspect, understanding how people use things does matter. This is where engineering, design and the community will benefit and need to work hand in hand to understand these components. It\u2019s crucial to consider human emotions when designing medical products. Often, it\u2019s the emotional connections that people have with respect to the design. Is it flexible? The weight, how it feels, is it aesthetically appealing?\nThen, of course, cost and accessibility that make people gravitate toward certain devices as opposed to others. With the joined forces of diverse backgrounds of Sara and Mauro, reHub will be addressing all these concerns.\nreHub-goal-oriented effective rehabilitative treatment and experience that will help patients return to family, job, community and resume regular daily activities.\nMore updates to follow.\n*The name of John and Physiotherapist have been used to maintain privacy.", "created_at": "2017-06-26 14:29:44", "updated_at": "2017-06-26 14:29:44", "tag_id": 485, "post_id": 861, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 828}, {"id": 6509, "text": null, "quote": "communities.

Is it possible to \"jump a generation\" in the organization of health care provision in developping countries? This is the underlying question of the \"modern\" collaborative care expriences we are going to share in this post about Coeur d'Or.\nAs a short backgrund, Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) induce yearly about 17 millions of deaths. Over 75% of those deaths occur in LMICs where risk factors are highly prevalent and the health system is poorly adapted to deal with chronicle and highly expensive emergent conditions. In Benin, the prevalence of high blood pressure is about 30%. Health promotion on this poorly funded issue, in this limited resource setting, requires innovative communication tools. To this end, C\u0153ur d\u2019Or (www.facebook.com/groups/coeurdor/ ) was created in 2011, to test the feasibility of using social media for providing promotional and preventive care against CVD in Benin, in a collaborative way.\nWe aim\u00a0here to present briefly\u00a0C\u0153ur d\u2019Or , and some lessons learned so far. We use a case study approach based on participatory observation, (in) formal in-depth interviews with different stakeholders and documents reviews on the solution. \u00a0Social media analytics tools are used for the quantitative analysis of the profiles of the solution users and activity.\nC\u0153ur d\u2019Or is an open Facebook group of 21615 members, mainly from Benin (West Africa). It runs as a tool of keeping in touch with a huge number of the community members, allowing for a double-sense communication, spreading cutting-edge information on CVDs and building a community-based leadership on CVD. The targets are young, mainly from urban and semi-urban areas, educated and active on social media. They connect to the platform using mainly smartphones.\u00a0 A wide range of subjects related to CVDs and Non-Communicable Diseases are discussed from several perspectives. Members can initiate a discussion stream, receive inputs from several profiles of members and get a summary from a medical expert based on key evidence-based prevention measures against CVD.\nThe group stands also as a social mobilization and community participation tools influencing the agenda setting at the national level. It is currently a member of the Multisectorial National Committee against NCDs in Benin, as a leading actor supporting the organization of national campaigns against CVD in Benin each year since 2011.\u00a0 Using its online critical mass and its growing network in traditional media and several public and private institutions, the group is capable of mobilizing each year since 2013 material and financial resources up to 25,000 \u20ac to organize offline activities such as a walk (about 5000 participants each year), risk factors screening, interactive conferences during the world heart day. All those activities help at reaching people that are not active online and are done with the leadership of members that are not health workers.\nThe rapid development of telecommunications improves the access of a growing number of people to Internet and social media. A critical mass of the group improves its political influence and creates a web tool that can help for a viral diffusion.\nC\u0153ur d\u2019Or demonstrates the feasibility of using social media as an innovative approach for offering promotional and preventive care on health issues in sub-Saharan Africa.

We know that global health disparities around the world are vast, and it\u2019s estimated that one billion people will never see a doctor in their lifetime. In many places around the world - especially low and middle income countries - community health workers (CHWs) are closing that gap. CHWs are community members - sometimes volunteers, but ideally paid - who provide basic AND complex health care for their neighbors. Our vision is to equip these CHWs with mobile technology and the right tools to increase their impact.\nFor example, a community health worker can support in the following ways:\n\n\nIdentifying and supporting pregnant women;\n \n\nHelping ensure the pregnant woman gets four antenatal care checkups, and identify any danger signs. (Having frequent checkups increases the chance the mother will give birth in a facility and survive child birth.)\n \n\nEnsure that children are vaccinated fully;\n \n\nScreen children and adults for common diseases (diarrhea, malaria), malnutrition, mental health, etc.\n \n\nIn many of these scenarios, community health workers serve as first responders, so that patients can start getting treatment quickly.\nMedic Mobile\u2019s tools are oriented around specific evidence-based use cases that have a clear impact logic.

Till 1966, not a single person was at any stage of education, and the village have been known to export migrant workers to surrounding areas. Cars used to stop in a nearby village, and the drivers might have even not heard of the existence of the village. \n\u00a0\nIn 1982, nine youth from the village have decided to eradicate poverty. They started by collecting the Zakat (Charity religious duty) from the rich, as a first step to address poverty. Then decided to create a poultry farm with a capital of EGP 2000, and this was the beginning of the transformation. While writing the company's contract they decided to allocate 10% of the profit to be spent in the \u201cfaces of his goodness\u201d and called it the \"share the greatest partner,\" and when they found the profit was higher than they expected, the increased the percentage to 20% of the profit, until it reached 100% of the profits of ten farms (a sort of endowment). Over the years, beside the farms, number of factories were set \u2013 up to feed the cattle. They traded in agricultural products and exported citrus fruits, potatoes and onions to several countries outside Egypt. They established a bigger farm outside the village in a Tal El Kebeer, and the size of investments has reached 35 millions pounds, and three companies. \n\u00a0\nAn \u201cIslamic Center\u201d was founded to implement the charity \u201cZakat\u201d projects agreed upon through several committees: Committee for Education; Committee for agriculture; Committee for Youth; Committee for Health; Committee for the reconciliations and the Commission for Zakat. \n\u00a0\nIn few years, there has been four Azhar colleges: Sharia, education for boys, trade, and human studies for girls, students dorms, a nursery that accepts 350 children, a central hospital, a railway station and Central Communications, and Islamic complex services. The residents have established these projects by their own efforts, and without depending on the Government, in the framework of a series of annual projects that did not stop, but tended to increase after that they decided to engage in two major projects each year. They were able to eradicate poverty and extended their work in neighboring villages. \n\u00a0\nThe students are given free subscriptions to the railway, a free uniform, and two days before Ramadan flour and margarine containers are distributed for free on each of the village's houses, around 1000 houses including the mayors house.\n\u00a0\nStrategy for poverty eradication \nZakat Committee began to collect Zakat of the population according to their activity farmer gives of his crop, a trader gives goods, doctors in the village agreed to treat and follow \u2013 up specific cases of patients for free. They committee found that the poor tend to spend the money where given to them.m consequently and after sometimes this did not solve the problem of extreme poverty. They then decided to distribute 40 ewe on widows. The following year 20 buffalo calf for poor men. They let them men cultivate food for the calves, giving each men the right to use six carats of a land they had bought for the construction of educational facilities. They provided the unemployed youth with machines (carpentry, mechanics or blacksmith), and to older people kiosks or vehicles to sell home made food, they also helped with the health certificate (micro \u2013 loans). Girls who have not completed their education where trained on sewing beside managing the house and preparing sweets, and literacy classes. They then got a sewing machine, four cloths, four reels thread for free to begin work.

In one project taking place at the lab, members are engineering yeast to express milk proteins from non-animal sources - next generation of vegan cheeses and milk. Others are busy developing an eco-friendly bacterial sunscreen.\nOpen Insulin is one of these projects, and its goal is to make it simpler and less expensive to make insulin, starting by investigating some novel ideas for making insulin in e. coli using fewer, easier steps than in common industrial protocols. If successful, the members hope it can be a step towards making generic production more economical, and might also enable more participation in research related to insulin, or production of the medicine at smaller scale, closer to the patients who need it, further reducing costs and giving access to more patients who lack it.\nCounter Culture Labs was founded by a group of hackers with diverse backgrounds and interests in the period from 2011 to 2012, with some members coming from Sudo Room, another hackerspace in Oakland that I participated in founding. Many were also involved in Occupy Oakland, and wanted to establish a more permanent organization with the same community spirit and values. Other members came from Biocurious, another biohacking space in Sunnyvale, in the southern end of the Bay Area. I became involved both because I shared the desire to build a community-focused institution, and because I have diabetes type 1 myself, which means I live with the frustration of costly and tedious treatment regimens day in and day out, and I know how much the standard of care for diabetes patients lags behind what recent research suggests might be possible. So, for my own sake, and for the sake of the others with the condition, I sought to take whatever steps I could to close the gap between the research and what is available to patients on the market right now.\nAbout a year ago, some long-standing discussions around making a bioreactor to produce insulin, which had inspired a few previous attempts, turned more concrete when Isaac Yonemoto, another independent researcher of medical treatments, made some suggestions to us about interesting possibilities for innovation and improvement in existing protocols. We started organising regular meetings, and out of those we then organized a successful crowdfunding campaign, which then opened up connections to professionals who work on various aspects of the problem, both the science and engineering around insulin, and the questions of access to medicine. Through this it came to our attention that access to insulin lags far behind the need even now, and even in the most developed countries - costs of insulin are prohibitive even to many people in the US - and all in all, roughly 50% of those in the world who require it have no access to insulin at all, according to the 100 Campaign, a group working on improving access to insulin around the world. There is almost no generic insulin on the American market at the moment - the first one appeared on the market about two weeks after we finished our crowdfunding campaign last year, but it is a long acting type, which is only part of the therapy required by people with diabetes type 1 (about 15-20% of diabetics in USA have type 1; the rest have type 2). And for those who use an insulin pump, short acting insulin is necessary.\nThe general problem in the first world is that the incentives and interests of producers and patient communities are not aligned.\nRight now we\u2019re focused on achieving the first scientific milestones, which is to produce proinsulin, the precursor of the active form of insulin, in e. coli, in our small-scale community lab. Our lab runs mostly on donated and salvaged equipment and reagents and might be comparable in its capabilities to a lab in a less-developed area of the world where there is the least access to insulin. If we succeed, it would show the possibility that small-scale producers in remote areas might be able to make insulin to satisfy local demand, in places where centrally-manufactured supplies can\u2019t reach due to lack of infrastructure - where what roads there are, if any, do not let refrigerated trucks pass to ship needed pharmaceuticals in. Once we have a protocol that embraces everything from production to purification to near the level of purity of pharmaceutical grade insulin, we plan to approach established generics manufacturers with a case for the economic feasibility of serving the unserved market for insulin, and to partner with them to do the rest of the work of achieving sufficient purity of the product and scaling the methods to production. As we proceed with our work, the main batch of patents around the various forms of insulin are expiring, which will further help us make the case for a comprehensive portfolio of treatments to potential generics manufacturers.\nProvided all this goes well, we might then pursue another idea, closer to our original hope of a bioreactor that produces insulin, and a kind of \u2018holy grail\u2019 goal in the DIY bio world, which is a desktop biofactory, an analog of desktop 3D printers, but for proteins and biologics, which we might develop to first execute one of our protocols to produce insulin, but which we might also design with more flexibility in mind. This would consist of a bioreactor portion that could grow a culture of e. coli or yeast, and then extract and purify a product from it - very roughly speaking, the union of a fermenter with an FPLC, a piece of equipment that purifies proteins. If that is possible, supply of insulin could be placed very close to the demand of the diabetics around the world in a simple, economical package, and reliance on distribution infrastructure would be minimized. It would also reduce the need to have skilled technicians with years of lab experience to execute these protocols by hand.\nUltimately, I hope that opening up the tools for research to more people can help to bring research on cures to patients, and not just treatments. Let me mention a few of the more promising ideas that have had some success in research settings. One approach is to implant functioning pancreatic cells from a donor and protect them from immune attack by various means - hard to scale if you need a constant supply of donors,but it might be possible to grow cultures of the cells in vitro to address this. Another approach is to get the immune system to cease its attack on pancreatic cells, and promote the regrowth of the body\u2019s own insulin-producing cells, either in the pancreas, or in another tissue via gene therapy - a simpler approach to apply once it is developed. Some of the ideas use very inexpensive supplies such as adjuvants, the materials in vaccines that provoke an immune response - and there has been some success using adjuvants alone, or with carefully chosen additions, to get the bodies of diabetic patients to reduce or cease their autoimmune attacks. Other concepts address the metabolic changes behind type 2 diabetes. Several drugs between the research and commercial worlds of medicine can act directly on the metabolic control mechanisms of the body, changing its pattern of energy use and other aspects of metabolism back from the pathological state of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes to the normal, healthy base state. Some of them are small organic molecules, easier to make than proteins such as insulin, but due in part to reasons of cost and incumbency, are not mainstream treatments yet.\nAt the most general level, what we seek to prove is that if an order of magnitude more people get involved in research and development of science and technology, medicine can progress much faster, and might no longer be held back by institutional constraints and perverse incentives in the economics of the institutions. Right now, we\u2019re a group about half a dozen people working regularly on the project, with a few dozen more people in touch every now and then to help out, and a hundred or two in the extended community, ready to answer a question or call for help. Every week or two, someone new comes to the group, who just learned about the project via the media or our regular meetups, and wants to help. Some are complete beginners and end up taking our introductory classes to biohacking, some already have experience but got tired of the limits of the institutions where they worked, or have relatives with diabetes and want to contribute to progress. Though we\u2019re building up a broader community of participation in research slowly, we hope our efforts can plant many seeds out of which future innovations will grow.\nMeanwhile, we are looking to broaden a circle of people who can advise us, experienced scientists and engineers who can help us troubleshoot issues that inevitably come up when investigating the unknown, but we also hope to inspire other groups to work independently in a broader community of innovation. We would like to set up a network of both institutional and DIY researchers living all around the world who have different approaches and ways of making insulin as well as tackling other diabetes and health related issues. Beyond producing drugs, participants might research questions of access to medicine, investigate what patient communities need the most, look at academic publications to identify the most promising research that is not making it out to serve patients, or help establish the effort to build the desktop biofactory. Part of our goal is to prove it\u2019s possible and worthwhile for people outside institutions to take the initiative on these questions, and inspire others to take the lead in their own efforts and bring about the broader changes we seek.\nDo you have any projects in health, medicine, or biohacking that you\u2019d like to work on, but lack people, knowledge, or resources to make it happen?

But I don't think it's quite that simple. \"Being different\", going by a different value system, is itself entropic. Here's why: to accomplish anything, we humans need other humans. Other humans are attracted by \"successful\" (as per the dominant canon of what \"successful\" means). Moreover, we suffer from a documented psyhological bias called the halo effect, that makes us assume that success trasfers across domains. If you are a successful marathon runner, I will rate higher your\u00a0chances of starting a viable company, even though the skills involved with running marathons are not the same ones needed to run a business. People will help more gladly others when they think they are winners. By doing so, they will increase the chances of success of these perceived winners.\u00a0So, being perceived as successful increases your chances of actually being successful.\u00a0\nThat's not to say you cannot define your own measure of success. But it does mean this is a lot easier when done in tribes. If you inhabit a cluster of the global social graph that goes by different rules, you are kind of OK being different, because your social network is also different, and that means you can mobilize those people to help in whatever it is you are doing. You can enjoy a reasonable measure of social esteem, even if it is localized in your corner of the graph.\u00a0\nAn unfortunate consequence of this is that, the more different you want to be, the more energy\u00a0you need to invest promoting yourself. The message is \"look at me, I am not a failure, I am a success by my own measure\". Social media are full of this, often cloaked in hyper-individualistic narratives, of the \"I quit my day job to follow my dream\" type.

I will share with you few things in hope it is beneficial :).\nHaven't felt depression in years, sadness very rarely and short termed. I believe sadness comes from our inability to accept a certain situation, our resistence to it. If there is a situation we don't like we have only two choices: Accept it as it is or change it or at least try to change it. In both situations we shouldn't be depressed. If de did all in our power and failed to change it, we should be satisfied with ourselves and accept the outcome, since there is no alternative. However i do believe once sadness comes we should not try to supress it, let it run its course because anything else would be commiting violence upon our own nature and sadness would still manifest itself somehow.\nGood at school, always calm and good kid, inventive, reading since i was 5, playing chess since my 6th year...i can't really tell how many times i heard my family members say this dreadful phrase to their children: \"just take Jasen's example, can't you be like him\".\u00a0\nThan i was 27, married, hated my job, didn't love my wife, i was miserable and had a lot of health issues. I started wondering: \"how did i end up right here at this moment in life?\" I knew i totally went off my path but didn't yet realise how or where is my path.\u00a0\nAfter realising\u00a0the community in which i grew up actually applied huge subconscious pressure on me through their projections of myself, through their expectations especially, and that so many of my life's actions were led by those thoughts in my head which were not really my thoughts. (i actually got married because everyone was telling me it's the right time and after some time it made sense...how crazy!).\nMy next step was\u00a0selfexploration, i had to get to know myself. I stayed at home reading books for months, Carlos Castaneda's books were an amazing discovery at that time. I went into nature for periods of isolation where i spent my time in silence and thought, and finally after some time i started meditating.\u00a0\nAs far as success is concerned i agree with Alberto. Should we measure ourselves in comparison to others or by finding our own system of values and definition of success? For example i have 0 debt, built my own house by the age of 28, a good\u00a0car and pretty much anything i need materially now...most of my friends think i am succesful. I would however consider myself succesful if i could succeed in creating a well balanced family full of love and respect, or if i could be nothing but a positive and inspiring experience for anyone who meets me. Or if i could attain permanent state of meditation for example. Also i have been with many women, and ofcourse friends\u00a0i went out with always considered me lucky or succesful with women. Well again my definition of success is very different: i would have preferred to stay with the first one i loved...or with any i loved.

We are hopeful as the entire project is entitled\u00a0\u201cA different Shakespeare\u201d, and all the actors and actresses are differently able, being deaf or physically immovable. It was neither a barrier nor limitation from being in performing arts in terms of being deaf and wheel chair users, losing any part of limbs but at the end being able to express in the way you are and this time the maximum participants were selected from BRIDGE foundation.\nWe finished a boot camp based on \u2018From Sign Language to C++\u201d based on Programming for Differently Able and especially for deaf\u00a0\u00a0 and the targeted group was around 14-18 with the help of two young, enthusiastic undergrads who worked as trainer on voluntary basis. BRIDGE foundation itself is consisted with all the youth volunteers and state department alumnus who are spirited for the community betterment; community based services, youth and civic engagement as well as future leaders of Green Earth campaign.\nIn 2015 December we ,the BRIDGE Foundation initiated the project \u201cARTPreneur for Differently Able Young Deaf Artists\u201d where they do have opportunities to work under the experts through monthly basis workshop and selling their art work through online as well.

Female Participation is required to be increased through consultation and motivation to find out their feasibility and access in future.\nLast but not least we do urge to every activist and volunteer to support us being actively engaged as a volunteer through BRIDGE Foundation and work for the excluded group through sharing, teaching and capacity building being a facilitator for each and every differently able to be touched through voice, through your eyes, your touchy fingers, extended and helping hands and valuable time at the end. Mainstream has been done, has been doing and will be doing but what about excluded, scheduled and out stream people?\u00a0if we don\u2019t listen to voice of silence, to make the immovable a movable one through IT, technology and information which can lessen the gap of \u201cDigital Divide\u2019 and can ensure \u201cDifferently Able in Development \u201cwith a positive notion instead of \u201cDisable in Development\u201d the Sustainable and inclusive development will be a myth only. At the end I do believe you are not disabled unless you\u00a0believe that and I am hopeful that the government initiated the strategies of inclusion for the \u201cDifferently Able\u201d even though that are in the limited era but this is the beginning. One day there will be no separate school in the name of special education,\u00a0and both the parents and teachers would be cooperative to include them and mainstream institutions, organizations and corporations will come forward to engage them and believe in their potentiality.

The glove designed for proprioceptive rehabilitation and to recover movement fluidity after an injury.\u00a0 It allows the patient to record and report exercises, data- such as hand position and fingertips pressure.\nIn 2014 Sara\u00a0Savian\u00a0and Mauro Alfieri started their journey with a \u201ctest on sensors \u201cand they had presented their first prototype at the Arduino User Group & Wearables community at WeMake. The purpose for this to share projects, knowledge and create discussions on Arduino and Wearables and smart textiles.\u00a0 The intent was to explore how it can be used? How can it add value and be of use socially?\u00a0 What could be built on this foundation? These discussions could change the course for many participants.\nSara and Mauro not only had many questions answered, but they left with the idea of going back to the drawing board and creating something that would be beneficial to society.\nA conversation between a physiotherapist and someone suffering from hand disability created inquiry for Sara and Mauro. They exchanged and shared thoughts on their project, how could it be of use and that led to further discussion. It was the trigger point for them and a stepping stone for their project. We can\u2019t capture every discussion that took place as dialogue is woven into many discussions. But this one interaction planted the seed for what is now reHub.\n\u00a0We asked Sara to recollect this conversation:\nJohn: \"I suffer from a hand disability that limits my activities of daily life. Self-sufficiency is greatly reduced and hinders the quality of life for me. Constant monitoring of my movements and joints must be done frequently to evaluate my progress by and going back and forth as an outpatient for evaluations. This interferes with my daily activities\u201d*\nPhysiotherapist: \u201cThere has been an advancement in technologies in the rehabilitation to help patients achieve maximum recovery outcomes. In Italy, physiotherapists have no access to digital tools to evaluate rehabilitative progress for hand movements. Having instant access to this therapy anytime would be greatly beneficial.*\nWe asked Sara and Mauro how this conversation altered the course for reHub.\nSara: \u201cThis made us re-evaluate our project in a variety of ways and prompted us to think in broader terms and combine the \"test on sensors\" with solving a problem. We know that there is a lot of learning that needs to be done when you put the device in the hands of people that are just things you would not expect\".\u00a0\nMauro: From this discussion, Sara and I saw the opportunity offer a solution and an experience of an emerging area of wearable technology together with the sensing technology and decided to create a device that could be delivered in a rehabilitation approach to support patients\u2019 and to monitor hand rehabilitation. From listening to challenges that are faced on a daily basis, and realizing how painful it is for the patient and family. We need to work with them to help co-create with us\u201d.\nWith the project in its early stage, Sara wanted to share this:\nSara: \u201cThere is much work to do including working with actual users and receiving their feedback. With the goal of making it open source, fully customizable and adaptable, a community of user is required. We are solving the problem of monitoring the progress of rehabilitation therapy and the people directly impacted must be included.\u201d\nWe asked what\u2019s next for reHub.\nSara: \"We know that rehabilitation is time-consuming and demotivating and we plan to change that with a reHub device to empower patients through their therapy. Rehabilitation is often costly, by making it open source, it\u2019s affordable and accessible for people who are living with limitation and this could drastically improve their mental well-being during the road of recovery\u201d. This will allow the vast majority of patients to be sent home with a rehabilitation program to practice on their smartphone or tablet.\"\nThe reHub team is taking a broad approach in this area and looking for users and a community that will benefit and help develop different options: sport, gaming, educational, medical.\nWhy is it important to work with the community to further develop reHub?\nSara: \"Spending time with a community, or patients that will benefit from what you\u2019re creating is looking at the problem in a human-centered way and it highlight\u2019s what\u2019s needed instead of just relying on responses to questions. Spending time with people in the area of use is a really important step in the design process. So we\u2019re back to the drawing board. We need to know what from the user's perspective so we can design with them in mind.\"\nCo-creation, it matters. There is the emotional and functional connection that people have to a medical device. As far as functional, understanding how people use things, what they need to get done daily. \u00a0When we think of medical devices we initially think of accuracy, consistency, making sure it delivers the expected results. These are crucial reasons why design should be human oriented.\nMauro Alfieri: \u201cWe thank all the physiotherapists we have had a chance to meet with \u00a0which could effectively confront the future of this project, orienting it to a continuous use in proprioceptive physiotherapy.\"\nIf people can\u2019t achieve expected results due to a design issue or flaw, then that\u2019s obviously going to have a clinical impact. From a functional aspect, understanding how people use things does matter. This is where engineering, design and the community will benefit and need to work hand in hand to understand these components. It\u2019s crucial to consider human emotions when designing medical products. Often, it\u2019s the emotional connections that people have with respect to the design. Is it flexible? The weight, how it feels, is it aesthetically appealing?\nThen, of course, cost and accessibility that make people gravitate toward certain devices as opposed to others. With the joined forces of diverse backgrounds of Sara and Mauro, reHub will be addressing all these concerns.\nreHub-goal-oriented effective rehabilitative treatment and experience that will help patients return to family, job, community and resume regular daily activities.\nMore updates to follow.\n*The name of John and Physiotherapist have been used to maintain privacy.", "created_at": "2017-06-26 14:27:50", "updated_at": "2017-06-26 14:27:50", "tag_id": 322, "post_id": 861, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 828}, {"id": 7009, "text": null, "quote": "(2) Artists are particularly interesting people in demographic terms - their lifestyle, outlook, and society's perception of them allows them to connect vertically, linking people from different socio-economic groups.

We are hopeful as the entire project is entitled\u00a0\u201cA different Shakespeare\u201d, and all the actors and actresses are differently able, being deaf or physically immovable. It was neither a barrier nor limitation from being in performing arts in terms of being deaf and wheel chair users, losing any part of limbs but at the end being able to express in the way you are and this time the maximum participants were selected from BRIDGE foundation.\nWe finished a boot camp based on \u2018From Sign Language to C++\u201d based on Programming for Differently Able and especially for deaf\u00a0\u00a0 and the targeted group was around 14-18 with the help of two young, enthusiastic undergrads who worked as trainer on voluntary basis.

Female Participation is required to be increased through consultation and motivation to find out their feasibility and access in future.\nLast but not least we do urge to every activist and volunteer to support us being actively engaged as a volunteer through BRIDGE Foundation and work for the excluded group through sharing, teaching and capacity building being a facilitator for each and every differently able to be touched through voice, through your eyes, your touchy fingers, extended and helping hands and valuable time at the end. Mainstream has been done, has been doing and will be doing but what about excluded, scheduled and out stream people?\u00a0if we don\u2019t listen to voice of silence, to make the immovable a movable one through IT, technology and information which can lessen the gap of \u201cDigital Divide\u2019 and can ensure \u201cDifferently Able in Development \u201cwith a positive notion instead of \u201cDisable in Development\u201d the Sustainable and inclusive development will be a myth only.

The City Administration regulated the matter for new buildings as well as existing ones. The latter faced a variety of unforeseen problems that resulted into a 10% compliance rate in 15 months since the law passed. In the common understanding, this means a public effort not hitting the target, a cracked relationship between the City Administration and private businesses and ultimately disadvantaged people still vulnerable.\nThe story begins in 2015 with the City of Milan to pass the Building Regulation article 77 that required all bars, shops, restaurants and craft activities bordering the road, to provide easy access to people with limited mobility or disabilities (the National Institute of Statistic in 2007 assessed 13.189 people with mobility disabilities in Milan). This normative action was the instrument that City of Milan deployed to overcome architectural barriers and provide universal free access to public places by 2017.\n\nIn November 2016, 12 month after the law passed the City of Milan assessed only 2.000 businesses compliant over 18.000. An article on la Repubblica, the second most read Italian newspaper, by the 5 January 2017, published these data and opened a public discussion on the subject.\nLisa Noja (delegate of the Major for accessibility policies) said: We have to make sure that very quickly all businesses comply. This year we want to get to the full application of a rule of civilization and to do that you cannot only use repressive strategies.\nIt was a beginning of a twist in the Municipal strategy and the start of a speculation about the most effective way to enforce a regulation. The new thinking included working with trade associations, like Confcommercio, as well as promoting campaigns to engage business holders.\nCristina Tajani (City Councillor for labour policies, businesses, trade and human resources) said: places that show attention to the disabled are also easily accessible to children, parents with strollers and the elderly. This does not mean that they will not be submitted to controls, but we want help the business understand that the adjustment should not only be seen as an obligation. It is also a business opportunity.\nThis is when OpenCare approach came handy. Local staff including WeMake was involved and started talking to as many people as possible, to understand what was not working and tentatively get it streight.\nListening\u00a0it was vital to start from the pieces of the City Administration that were involved from the beginning like the Major Cabinet, the Urbanistic Department, the Public Soil Occupation Office and lately Urban Economy and Work department. We have understood that the building legislation was conceived in a department and the implementing regulation was written in a different one (and of course published through another one). That gave a lot of room to officers for interpretations and tightening the instructions for businesses to prevent opportunistic behaviors. \u00a0\u00a0\nIncluding as the collaboration with the trade association got closed we\u2019ve understood more of the problems that businesses are facing to comply with the regulation, such as: high costs, complex red tape, lack of understanding of the most suitable solution and existing solutions too standardized. Since red tape is partially due to complex implementing regulations and the unclear communication follows, we started facilitating a mutual dialogue between pieces of public administration, businesses and associations. Regarding costs and production related problems, we can take it into the arena of manufacturing 4.0 by including also designers, makers, social innovators, businesses and utilizers.\nGoing where innovation beats\u00a0we have started organizing an experimentation called Open Rampe (Rampe means Ramps/Slides) in a limited area of the city that has everything it takes. The Quartiere Isola in fact has a functioning District for Urban Commerce, a civic center devoted to urban regeneration, art and crafts workshops (ADA stecca), active businesses and a long tradition of civic participation. Our idea is to engage business individually and through a public event by 11th April. Involving them into\u00a0co-design sessions pivoting around their necessities may generate unexpected outcomes.\nDealing with collective intelligence\u00a0is what we have just started doing by sharing this story here. Any input from the community could be brought into our experimentation and add value to it. It would be interesting to study this collaboration as it happens and share it.\nThis is where we stand now and the next steps are:\nCo-designing / mobilizing resources\u00a0of course we will not predefine outputs, but rather keep the sessions open to any outcomes.\nPrototyping policies\u00a0by monitoring and evaluating this experimentation.\nWe are aware that talking about \u201cenforcing\u201d a policy collaboratively may sounds an oxymoron. Since article 77 of the building regulation fits in the EU and the National legal frameworks, it is certainly a top down process.\u00a0Nevertheless, the Open care approach might help policy makers, (non)compliant businesses, users and citizens to achieve simpler, cheaper and faster solutions.\nIt would be interesting to know who else has been involved in a similar process and managed it collaboratively.
