However once we\u2019d departed it was difficult to stay in touch, to coordinate, collaborate and balance our other lives with the potential we saw in the future of EdgeRyders.\n\nThis session focused on the high speed mapping of roles, skills and network reach - so we can better identify the real potential of the community and to make the connections with each other necessary in realising that potential. It was followed up by pooling the goals, competencies and challenges from a community perspective on how the EdgeRyders\u2019 membership and platform might become capable of delivering for those participating and the greater goals of the project. Drawing from the roles and skills identified in the first part of the day, we used <a href=\"http://www.methodkit.com/\">Methodkit</a>, a tool developed by community member Ola M\u00f6ller, to create a clearer picture.\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"mceTemp\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>What came out of this track?</strong></h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"mceTemp\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"unmonastery.eu/TEST\"><img alt=\"UnMonastery\" class=\"wp-image-3395 alignnone\" height=\"198\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/unMonastery.png\" title=\"unMonastery\" width=\"198\"></a></h2>\n\nEdgeryders Asset Mapping (work in progress)\n\n<a href=\"http://piratepad.net/uGaAJAWLbC\">The Unmonastery</a> (work in progress) Copy on the Day in the Life of the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/unmonastery\" target=\"_blank\">@unmonastery</a>- feedback here please! <a href=\"http://t.co/tner4wYl\" target=\"_blank\">http://t.co/tner4wYl</a>\n\nEdgeryders Community Mapping (work in progress)\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A3RsSOE-FzkOrCXk8-C4qZXQbXzPfhtr8j2wvPvpZg0/edit#\">Bridging networks and building local-global collaboration</a> (model development)\n\nLinking up street level projects Challenges' infopool/coop Expedition Freedom\n\n<h1 class=\"mceTemp\"><strong>Policy Hero Challenge:</strong></h1>\n\nhttps://twitter.com/KatBorlongan/status/277069053988831233\n\n<script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\nThe Rewiring innovation policy track explored <strong>what innovation policy aimed at supporting innovative networked individuals, rather than organizations might look like</strong>. In the course of the session, Edgeryders itself was used repeatedly as an example of a network of innovative\u00a0 individuals. The main conclusion was that for accountability reasons there is a need for organisational shells that interfaces between individuals and sources of public support such as governmental funding bodies. The track split into three subsessions. The first looked at what organizational form might Edgeryders take to best support the innovative individuals participating in the network. The second identified non-monetary forms of support that institutional actors possibly could offer individuals. The third explored in more detail how resources already available within the Edgeryders network could be leveraged for mutual cooperative support. The second policy track explored <strong>how we could better go about supporting bottom-up social infrastructures that regenerate human potential</strong>. In various parts of Europe, at hyper local scales, innovative doers are prototyping groundbreaking ways that combine community spirit, peer to peer learning and economic value, while increasing resilience. Initiatives such as Incredible Edible Todmorden, the Stroud Open Gardens and Community Supported Agriculture projects in the UK or the Prinzessinnengarten in Berlin are all based on a community volunteering model: some are using donated public land as they grow (organic) food; connect with vendors to generate revenues and become self-sustainable; or campaign for the learning of food-growing in schools. Despite much talk about social innovation, policies that fosters, supports and coordinate these efforts are patchy at best. The actionable is a blueprint for latching innovative, radical initiatives resulting in social cohesion to existing public policy frameworks.\n\n<h2 class=\"mceTemp\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n\n<strong>What came out of </strong><strong>this track?</strong>\n\n</h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"mceTemp\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/weber-011.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3388\" height=\"276\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/weber-011-300x212.png\" title=\"weber-01\" width=\"391\"></a></h2>\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MB4ayjX_vWjAMVeUQNKmgJ24Z_Qi0ZGdXeutD-2931M/edit#\">Edgeryders Venture Social Capital Fund Model </a>(work in progress)\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_uvDH5sPsAf2VSLm6r3dVhNxQB56L8usjYcGV6LX8ao/edit#\">Proposals for Edgeryders Organisation in three cases</a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2 scenarios: no funding &amp; little funding)\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKWI4oLuvKnUG1gDvA3DiY4g_Fl2vTBvpn4IV1LnFjc/edit\">Proposals for UnMonetary support</a> (work in progress)\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">\u00a0</h1>\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Community Action Hero Challenge:</strong></h1>\n\nThe two final days were dedicated to seeing how we can collaborate to drive the community forward, making use of the huge amount of resources we have collectively.

A few posts ago, <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/2011/10/meet-team-gilda-farrell/\">Gilda</a> confessed she took up Edgeryders due to a personal committment, among other reasons. For me as well, there is an inner motivation which answers the question: \u201cwhy do I enjoy working on Edgeryders better than anything I\u2019ve done so far?\u201d Originally, I am from <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/ILoveCluj\">Cluj-Napoca</a>, a city at the heart of Transylvania in Romania. I first heard about Edgeryders when <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/2011/10/meet-team-alberto/\">Alberto Cottica</a> proposed I manage content that goes out through the blog and to our community. At that time I was preparing to rellocate in Strasbourg for a traineeship at the Council of Europe, so here I am making the best out of this. Embarking on this project means having a distinct feeling that it\u2019s not a \u201cwork\u201d project per se, rather it\u2019s a journey, an approach so novel and intimately challenging that I see it succeeding already. Why? Because I test me in this experiment. I myself am an Edgeryder. I am youth in transition, but before I even learned of this terminology I saw what my friends go through when having to make abnormal decisions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>choose between study poor vs work to make a living &amp; remain uneducated</li>\n\n<li>become independent with a menial job vs go back to living with parents, in small towns &amp; lack of opportunities</li>\n\n<li>forming a family at twenty something years old is out of the question for most etc.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nNot everybody has the courage to walk the blade, take initiative, but you can learn how to do it..! In my opinion the learning experience is the most important gain of the community on Edgeryders. Going back to small towns can be rewarding if you look at it from the right angle. To this respect, I now understand what innovative means : ) I hear the words \u201ccreative\u201d and \u201csocial innovation\u201d a number of times a day and they didn\u2019t even used to be part of my vocabulary. With edgeryding people both in the team and in the community, I am starting to see the edges myself. I am a graduate of social science research, so in my work so far I\u2019ve looked at the social space only from an outside perspective. Through Edgeryders I get to see how the social actually shifts, I am both a reviewer and an active participant in something with direct impact on my life and my friends\u2019 life, how could I not love it? I love it!\n\n", "created_at": "2011-10-27 07:44:36", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 13:23:12.166571", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 520, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 117.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18178, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4328, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Yes, normal until I install the new version</b>\n\nDan has finished the sidebar, but I did not yet test and merge it and install it online.

As parties involved are interested in peace-building and conflict-prevention, a lot of the series is supposed to be about struggling for transparency, accountability and collaborative leadership. Viewers will be also given insight into governmental mechanisms, different tensions and interests that shape country's politics, and so on.\n\nAs the series are about to be released in September, it means some decisions about what \"post-constitutional\" order to depict were already taken. At the same time, Nepal is making <a href=\"http://www.ekantipur.com/2015/06/09/top-story/way-paved-for-constitution/406314.html\">some progress towards deciding on a constitution</a> - this week 4 main parties agreed on a set of very important aspects of the document. They will develop the idea of federal state (a special commission that needs to be formed now will have 6 months to come up with detailed proposal) and parliamentary democracy. Although the expected promulgation of the new constitution is <a href=\"http://www.ekantipur.com/2015/06/14/top-story/new-constitution-by-mid-july-a-tough-ask/406529.html\">scheduled for mid-July</a>, according to media this seems quite unlikely.\n\nI wonder if there will be the post-constitutional Nepal while the series will screened - and to what extent will the fiction be similar to reality. And if it will shape people's preparedness for more equal distribution of genders in the politics and indeed promote cooperative and ethical ways. I'm just really curious to see the series and the context in which they will appear in national TV channels.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-14 06:22:16", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 14:34:07.282096", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 420, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 100.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9761, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5063, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Love this</b>\n\nAnd mean to participate, compatibly with my responsibilities in the care track.

We also realized that we may lack clarity on how many people we can accommodate in next two months, and the process of extending residencies for current unMonasterians.\n\nAlso during our meeting we discovered need to estimate <strong>feasibility</strong>\u00a0of proposed projects and incorporate lessons from our experience of having more projects happening then people in the house. To make realistic estimate of willingness and capacity of <em>Supporting, developing and collaborating on existing unMonastery projects</em>\u00a0we may need to enhance our application process to include clear (bulletpoints) requests of support from all the existing projects as well as invite people applying to add additional precise offers of support they can think of and feel excited to put out! When it comes to <em>Supporting and contributing to development of the Cultural Program for Matera's bid for Capital of Culture 2019</em>\u00a0our friends at MT2019 committee seem to stay in best position to estimate this aspect of applications. Also in the spirit of <strong>in-kind</strong>\u00a0support from the community we want to take more open perspective on <em>fundraising</em>\u00a0to include, and possibly even emphasize, creative experiments with <strong>securing real world assets (products &amp; services) through various other means</strong>, while still keeping monetary funds as pragmatic fallback.\n\nHaving all above in mind and still wanting to take care of the needs which originally motivated this call for applications we propose:\n\n<strong>1. For now inviting only Juliana and Alessandra for residencies in June and July - They both:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>speak italian language</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>lived in Matera for long or very long time and stay well connected with local community</strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>work on local social innovation projects\u00a0preceding\u00a0unMonastery:Matera - <a href=\"http://www.benetural.com/en/\">Casa Netural</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AgriNetural\">Agri Netural</a></strong></li>\n\n<li><strong>stayed present in unMonastery in past months and participated in some of our developments in that time</strong></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>2. Clarifying ASAP our capacity of accommodating people in next 2 months, by starting a focused workstream for it right away.</strong>\n\n<strong>3. Based on experience from this process as well as the original applications of Matera pilot, propose clear, open and robust process for allocating all the rest of available residences among current unMonasterians interested in extending their stay as well as all the other people who replied to our current call.</strong>\n\nWe also see urgency to agree at least about inviting Alessandra and Juliana and notifying them by Tuesday (May 20th) morning. Keeping in mind that this way we leave them <strong>only 10 days</strong> to make all the arrangements they may need to make so that they can move in with the beginning of June!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-16 23:21:09", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 06:22:05.704616", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 786, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1604], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16649, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 3190, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Minutes from Session</b>\n\n<span><span>This is an overview of minutes from the unMonastery in-a-box session run at unMonastery on the 23rd of June.

She is a dear friend of mine and recently she is the co-founder of a new project called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/4PlusPhoto/info?tab=page_info\">4Plus</a>. The aim of 4 Plus is the development of Armenia's photojournalism and documentary photography, as well as raising awareness about issues in Armenia through photography. In their work they touch many social issues in Armenian society, which are challenging and inspiring for the people in Armenia and abroad.\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>I've recently interviewed Anush in Yerevan and here is the transcript.</em>\n\n<strong>How you got started and current situation?</strong>\n\n\u201cI'm one of the founders of 4Plus Documentary Photography Center which is not only developing documentary photography but also focusing on the empowerment of women, specifically female photographers in Armenia. We got started in 2012 but only got registered as an NGO last year. There are 3 photojournalists in the team and we are all on equal terms on this collective initiative.\u201d\n\n<strong>Who's involved: roles and responsibilities?</strong>\n\n\u201c4Plus is\u00a0an initiative by three Armenian documentary photographers, <a href=\"http://www.nazikarmenakyan.com/\">Nazik Armenakyan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.anahithayrapetyan.com/\">Anahit Hayrapetyan</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.anushbabajanyan.net/\">Anush Babajanyan</a>.\u00a0All 3 of us do pretty much the same work and we share the responsibilities equally. We are involved in two main activities:\n\n1. We do personal and group photography projects and it is mostly documentary photography.\n\n2. Education - We organize workshops and lectures, invite photographers and other experts of photography from abroad who can teach a group of individuals something specific - photo editing, multimedia, \u00a0etc.\n\n3. Exhibitions - two years ago we organised a group exhibition of 10 female documentary photographers called <a href=\"http://www.emahomagazine.com/2013/07/mother-armenia-group-exhibition-of-ten-women-photographers/\">mOther Armenia</a>\u00a0which was focused on social issues and human rights. It's a way for us to confront the issues that we have to deal with or observe in our society. It's mostly human rights issues bordering with arts, photojournalism (LGBT issues, women rights,environment, etc).\u201d\n\n<strong>Any partnerships?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe do not have any long-term official partnerships but we have some friends (photographers, curators, etc.) as well as some organisations (US and UK embassies in Armenia among others) who care a lot about what we do and help us along the way. Two of our main allies are the <a href=\"http://www.womenofarmenia.org/en/\">Women's Resource Center</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://www.osf.am/\">\u00a0Open Society Foundation</a>.\u201d\n\n<strong>What your main objectives are/why you do this?</strong>\n\n\u201cOur main objectives are to showcase the social issues in Armenia, to support women, documentary photography and ourselves as individuals. We do this because we came to realize that acting as a group as opposed to acting individually can bring more powerful impact and help solving the issues quicker than if we did it individually. We felt that we needed to get together and use all of our ability and experience, unite our backgrounds and knowledge for a more effective impact.\u201d\n\n<strong>What you enjoy about the work and what you enjoy less? </strong>\n\n\u201cI enjoy the times when I feel that what we believe in and what we have started this project for is working, happening, when I can see some tangible results. E.g. During<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/350500605078597/\"> mOther Armenia exhibition</a> we had lots of visitors and lots of articles were written about the issues that we exposed and that is really important for us.\n\nI enjoy less the obstacles that the society causes for us, things that work against us, like not being able to find the time for the projects. When, for example there is too much happening in our personal lives not letting us concentrate on our work. The society itself doesn't necessarily support and push us, rather it is against us.The idea of a collective of women photographers getting together and doing something for the women is a new concept in Armenia and it is not really accepted in our society. The mood in the country is not favorable for any kind of feminist movements in general.\u201d\n\n<strong>Do you think it would be easier for you to work if you were males?</strong>\n\n\u201cDefinitely. In general being a woman and trying to do some work has lots of challenges (family,\u00a0children,\u00a0responsibilities \u00a0at home), though it is not a big problem. The real\u00a0problem is when men (partners, co-workers, etc) do not accept and support you and your work is not considered as important compared to men's work. You feel doubt directed to you and you need to constantly prove/explain yourself as you are considered an amateur while a man is considered a professional by default. Of course, this is not only in Armenia, I have seen it in many muslim/arab countries but the difference with Armenia is that this problem is not so visible and it is mostly a pressure on a psychological level. In terms of what we are doing it a pressure on a professional level.\u201d\n\n<strong>What kinds of tasks do you do on a regular basis? Yearly, monthly, weekly, daily </strong>\n\n\u201cWe set an agenda for a year, a plan for 1-2 workshops, several lectures and possibly an exhibition. We try to find funding for that projects to bring our ideas to life. We also do our own photography projects besides group projects. As for our daily routine, it involves quite some administrative work - we need to apply for funding, thus filling in application forms, participate in relevant events, thus contacting respective agencies that organize the events, exchange emails, etc. We also travel a lot in Armenia and abroad to participate in joint exhibitions. We have to organize all the logistics and administrative preparations for the workshops and lectures we are holding. E.g. Our latest event was\u00a0 a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.564562800350254.1073741847.149553855184486&amp;type=3&amp;pnref=story\">meeting with John Stanmeyer</a>- World Press Photo winner and National Geographic photographer. We had to take care of the logistics(finding the necessary equipment - projector, audio equipment, white screen,etc) and managing the event (inviting people, publicity, Facebook event, etc). This event took place in Zovasar, a remote village in Shirak marz, some 2 hours away from the capital. It was specially organised for Zovasar schoolkids in the school gym, where John was presenting his works to the children and guests from Yerevan. It was quite a success with over 30 people attending the event from Yerevan plus around 30 kids from the village itself. John did a retrospective of his work both for National Geographic + Times magazine and his projects in Armenia and it was really very interesting both for kids and the guests!\u201d\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/ded6deccac3067b6c10dec41319e7975a36d18ce.jpg\" width=\"386\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<strong>What, other than money, do you think could help you in your work?</strong>\n\n\u201cPositive attitude and support of a more open and welcoming society would motivate us as opposed to the society \u00a0we live in which causes the issues that we turn around and document in our photographs.\u201d\n\n<strong>What help could you offer others and under which conditions (assuming no money is involved)?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe could offer any help concerning information related to Armenia. We are related to the NGO sector here and we could help with establishing contacts with them. We can advice on human rights, photography and any information related to Armenia. We are definitely open to communication and partnership with similar collectives from other countries, feminist or photography projects, etc.\u201d\n\n<strong>What do you produce/offer Products or services that you currently produce?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe produce documentary photography and organize workshops and lectures with the aim of educating the society.\u201d\n\n<strong>How do you go about doing this- what steps are involved?</strong>\n\n\u201cThe process is as follows: three women photographers get together, brainstorming and creating ideas and then realizing them/making them happen.\u201d\n\n<strong>Technologies or processes used? Costs: What expenses are involved?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe use computers, our brains and cameras of course. The costs are relative and it very much depends on the project.\u201d\n\n<strong>Who benefits from the work? Who currently supports it, how and why?</strong>\n\n\u201cThe beneficiaries are usually other photographs, mostly female photographers and the society in the long run.\u201d\n\n<strong>Existing alternatives: Who else is doing similar or relevant work/offering similar things- locally and or elsewhere? Important players affecting the work? (locally and internationally)</strong>\n\n\u201cActually there are no alternatives to what we do in Armenia. We are affected by local and foreign fellow photographers and NGOs like Open Society Foundation and Women's Resource Center. British and US embassies have supported some of our projects too.\u201d\n\n<strong>Long term perspective: any Business or sustainability plan?</strong>\n\n\u201cWe are going to continue doing what we do - workshops, photography and we hope to create long lasting educational programs and partnerships that would support us on a constant basis and that would last longer than a year, thus becoming more sustainable than right now.\u201d\n\n<strong>Transportation and logistics?</strong>\n\n\u201cIf we have a big project, larger than one lecture, the logistics and expenses are usually included in the grants we are applying for.\u201d\n\n<strong>What do you believe are the most important projects locally that are relevant to the work you are doing at this moment?</strong>\n\n\u201cProbably any of the projects that individual photographers are doing, as well as women's rights activism.\u201d\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3251093a3261628f508b0e508eef8ca3f76183a2.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"458\"><br>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-16 22:04:14", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 14:53:40.975672", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1792, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 311.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32525, "user_id": 2306, "topic_id": 3351, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>Accomodation in Matera</b>\n\nHi to everybody who is also looking for accomodation!\n\nI'd like to share\u00a0a room or\u00a0Flat or couchsurf or sth. else.

I don't know. how could we better put it then? \"Be gentle\u00a0carers of\u00a0one another\"?\n\nFor me, it's about teaching ourselves to pay attention and\u00a0grow aware, it rarely just happens.\u00a0example: Lote3 in Matera, despite all the agitation and organisational work which it required, was the only context this year for me personally when I was put in the position to lie down and grow aware (through Ronen's <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/yoga-know-your-edge\">yoga session</a>), learn about slowing down the engine\u00a0(in Nadia's <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/session-documentation-burning-edge\">burnout session</a>) or think of resources I could use to get there (the <a href=\"/t/the-lote3-aftermath/511/a-lote3-favourite-peer-to-peer-coaching-on-personal-projects-dilemmas\">p2p support session</a>). It was because someone (the \"care crew\"?) put up proposals for the sessions in the LOTE event. BUT the\u00a0context to have those sessions\u00a0was created through the running engine.\u00a0\n\nI think it's one thing to learn how to be more aware yourself (like you probably did throughout your life and experience),\u00a0and <em>another one</em> to embed\u00a0this on us all coming together in EdgeRyders - making it part of our vision + actionables,\u00a0and paving the way for others to learn it, myself included.\u00a0You probably don't want to hear this, again from me :) but embedding this onto ER needs some doers as well to create contexts\u00a0for growing aware, no? stuff like: unDojo\u00a0retreats, or the Burnout App or what not.. not my ideas, but I've been hearing all sorts ever since Lote. They only need initiative and coordination, which is what we're good at together..\n\nthat's more or less my rant. re-reading your comment now sounds more like: \"Let's change the world not (only) by solving problems, but\u00a0by taking a pause from them\" And then my question that follows would be: \"ok, but how do we learn to take a pause from them unless we work to make possible taking a pause?\" yes, I gonna need to be told firmly to take a pause ;)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-18 11:57:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:02.742305", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 443, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20525], "is_liked_by": [1672, 32], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11850, "user_id": 1867, "topic_id": 2507, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Interesting ideas!</b>\n\nHi Nadia,\n\nSorry for the late response!\n\nWe should definitely find ways to allign both initiatives together.

If this depends on any action from our current team, please make sure to communicate until then, so that it can be properly addressed.\n\nIt's great to see all these collectives federating and joining resources and efforts :) Looking forward for our joint processes.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-09 12:43:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:41.246983", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 152, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [105], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27848, "user_id": 1867, "topic_id": 3154, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Talk to me about:</b>\n\nBasically, I want to learn more about how large organizations can build trust and collaboration with citizens, and to also change the way individuals look at organizations (they tend to mainly look at them as a source of funding).\u00a0\n\nWe narrowed it down to this question: \"How to encourage organizations to adopt new models of inclusion and citizen participation rather than a top/down approach\".\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-24 12:11:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:33.592977", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 76, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14271, "user_id": 83, "topic_id": 1571, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Food mapping</b>\n\nJust disovered this food mapping tool which may be of interest to those interested in my report above:\n\nhttp://www.foodmapper.org.uk/\n\nIf you live in the UK and know of initiatives, projects and land that are not listed, why not pass the information on?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-25 16:17:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:20.684125", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 56, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19052, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4417, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Or actually, here's an idea</b>\n\nWe could *try* to turn the damn drudgery of transcribing into a way of involving the broader community.

Without trust, community-driven initiatives will not be supported by INGOs or government and will not play a significant role in reconstructions, <em>even though</em> they could do many tasks more efficiently. And currently, there is no such trust.\n\nSo how does trust develop? When I buy things online, I have to pay before I get anything, so obviously I need to trust the seller and look for a trustable seller. If there are not enough signs of trustability (like prior experiences by others), I would start with a small \"test\" order and if that goes well, do the real order.\n\nAnd like such interpersonal trust, trust between organizations can build up from past collaborations. These collaborations would start small like a \"test\", then gradually become larger, until finally the (I)NGO donor organizations each have some initiatives led by alternative leaders to whom they can entrust substantial amounts of resources. This trust building would need some \"success assessment\" done by the donor organizations, but especially the guts to <em>start</em> trusting these \"crazy\" uninstitutionalized grassroots activities to get things done. The first round of trust might only be enough for 1 Lakh NPR \u2026 but for a start, that would be just fine.\n\nOnce the large organizations have to start coordinating lots of small grants, @Alberto's point about the coordination costs becomes valid though. Maybe this trustbuilding (4 rounds with grants from 1000 USD to 100 000 USD) could be outsourced to an organization specializing in connecting communities with institutions \u2026 <img alt=\"wink\" height=\"23\" src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png\" title=\"wink\" width=\"23\">\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-21 16:29:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:50.291771", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 297, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 16.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30764], "is_liked_by": [428], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17098, "user_id": 2747, "topic_id": 4643, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Framasoft's MyPads to create private pads not ready yet</b>\n\nIt's important that we can share private, password-protected pads (just had this use case after \"Spot the future\" event in Bucharest last week).\n\nFramasoft has crowdfunded their project <a href=\"http://framablog.org/tag/mypads/\">MyPads</a> which will do just that.

I thought that this was pretty basic straight forward stuff to begin with (<span><span>if</span> <span>we put aside </span><span>my</span> </span><span><span>well-stocked </span></span><span><span>wish list</span> <span>of many other</span> things I'd like to see improve<span>...). </span></span>\n\nTherefore, I watch what you are doing in Europe, with great interest and attention. I was hoping that a successful intervention happening in Europe could maybe become a good incentive for action in Canada (standardisation between the 3 levels of gov: municipal, provincial, federal). But as we have seen these past months, best practices (ie Open Government Partnership) does not necessarily lead to enlightened decisions by Canadian decision makers. Sigh.\n\nNever ever ever give up, right? A 'No' is not an acceptable answer for me. And indifference isn't eigher. I might have to wait for the bilateral partnership between Gov of British Colombia and Gov of Quebec to happen, before bringing this up again. When this partnership gets well consolidated, the issue of open data standardisation could be raised once more, but to the provincial level (often in situations where they end up creating policies for the municipal level). Therefore I keep my idea of G4-growth into a coalition of open data cities up my sleeve. But please, Gentlemen, go ahead! if you can make it come to life before the other side of the Atlantic.

We often list, number, bullet point, but seldom do we engage in informal discussions where we share knowledge and reflect. It\u2019s in the reflection that we witness human capital being the driving force behind our projects. It\u2019s worth taking a look at SoundSight, whose story has sparked curiosity in co-creating care solutions. \u00a0There are many factors that determine the direction of our projects. For\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.soundsight.ch/\">SoundSight</a>\u00a0it has been an ongoing commitment of the human capital to bring forward this project.Experiencing co-creation is a method to bring value to patients in a personalized way with the intention to benefit patients in coping with their health and enhance their quality of life. Looks as though co-creating is the road where the community is defining the destination, planning the journey and sharing the drive. \u00a0Let\u2019s hear from Irene\u201d\n\n\u201cI can never thank the Reggio Emilia blind people union enough for accepting me in their community and interacting with me so sincerely and proactively. Let me say that 2 years ago I started spending some time with them, to enquire about their daily challenges, and to shadow some of them (who kindly volunteered) during their daily routines, I had conceived this as any other didactic activity of my university education, excitingly on the field, but not more special\u2026 how wrong could I have been!\n\nLong story short, I had reached out as part of a design thinking exercise, after brainstorming with my colleagues over social and technical literature to find solutions to the challenge of blind people navigation through living environments, \u201csimply\u201d to extract narratives about what we thought their problem to be and, thus, tune our solutions\u2026 We had succeeded obtaining the information we wanted, we had lists of the defeating features of currently existing solutions, descriptions of use cases, but while working on the desired features, something started to emerge for some of us in the team: another narrative had been seeping through our conversations with the blind volunteers, that we did not consider in advance. Most of the blind people we had talked to, despite agreeing to the obstacles imposed by visual impairment, did not consider that a defining condition and were rather cold to any assistive technology they tested or we described. Instead, narratives of empowerment, education, disintermediation, were flowing through most of their replies, even when our conversations were explicitly biased towards solutions\u201d.\n\nLet this sink for a moment. And remember that the number one challenge of helping another person is falling in love with the solution one wants to offer, losing sight of the\u00a0<strong>person</strong>\u00a0in exchange for the\u00a0<strong>problem</strong>.\n\nSo we asked Irene to recollect her most significant conversation for us:\n\nIL (<strong><em>Irene Lanza</em></strong>): \u201c<em>Good morning Maria<a href=\"/en/opencare-research/human-capital-is-what-drives-a-project-forward-part#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[</a>\u00a0I would like to thank you already for your time\u2026 it is truly precious to me to be able to talk with you\u201d</em>\n\nMBC (<strong><em>Mother of an 11years old blind child</em></strong>): \u201cGood morning Irene. I have heard about you from my friends and fellows from the blind union\u2026 they say you are a very polite and smart girl\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cAww\u2026 how much will they ask me to pay, now? \u2026haha\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201chaha\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cDid they also already tell you about what I would like to talk today?\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cvaguely\u2026 apparently, you are working on a new technology to assist blind people in their daily life\u2026?\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cThat is fairly accurate, but luckily they did not spoil our fun by letting you in too many details. In facts, we are working at the proof-of-concept of a wearable device that could analyze the surroundings in real time and feed information about objects, their velocities, and positions to a visually impaired user, to allow him/her moving naturally through a living environment\u2026 our challenge is to allow a blind person to play a football game competitively against people with normal vision\u2026 well, we would still not provide talent though\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cSo, are you thinking of something like those apps on the smartphones?\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cWell, not really\u2026 we would have dedicated hardware, and we would like to collect your opinions about how to design the user interface\u2026 a smartphone app would be a proof-of-concept compared to the kind of product design we are pursuing\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cI don\u2019t like this kind of assistive technology much\u2026 you never know it will let you down. So many factors: the signal may be lost, the battery may go down, the app could crash\u2026 what should I do then?\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cThis is exactly what I am here to listen to\u2026 you see, we will collect all these opinions, and try to prioritize features in our design concept\u2026 so, have you already tried some of those?\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cI am constantly exploring and searching for new tricks and tools that could help Mario, so I often talk about this topic with my friends at the union, and I try some them after reading their reviews or hearing their presentations. Most of them are quite far away from real life, for they are very specialized on single use cases, and they rely on infrastructural investments that in our Country are stagnating for too long already. Mario\u2019s problems extend well beyond walking through an airport or a shopping mall or reading the label on a tomato can. The only tool I really find useful is the reader with vocal synthesis on the smartphone: it works pretty well and it\u2019s so precious to be able to listen to any book when audiobooks are still not the norm\u2026\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cSo could you tell me more about Mario\u2019s experience? What do you think are the most commonplace barriers he experiences when going to school? How does he roam around?\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cHe is training with the stick. Many people dislike it, but it is rather dependable and attracts sufficient attention to ensure that other people will be more cooperative and safely behaved. However everyday life can become very problematic. Architectures are often hiding traps that would surprise for the naivety of those who designed the spaces: you would never imagine the feeling of dread when you have just seen your son missing an unprotected element from a window, protruding out of a wall with its sharp corners\u2026 and the use of the spaces themselves can be even more challenging! Hanging wires, doors opening directly on stairs, elements built in non-shock-resistant glass. Many of these, if you ask me, would be dangerous to any child, but if you factor in the inability to forecast what you are going to meet next\u2026 The risk of bad practices escalates quickly!\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cSo school is not a safe haven for Mario\u2026?\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cNot just that\u2026 most activities are not structured to include children like Mario. Schoolbooks are more difficult to find as eBooks for the vocal synthesizer than others. Even then, many graphics, whether didactic or there for testing purposes, remain inaccessible\u2026 and even the teachers, despite being adorable with Mario, are not informed about methods for inclusive teaching\u2026 For example, my husband is a musician, and he has always tried to exploit musical theory to organize our family games (she mocks for me a couple of games based on recognizing the tones, or what an object at home could be based on analogies of noises). We constantly try to use acoustics as a tool to explain concepts, and risks to our child\u2026\u201d\n\nIL: \u201c\u2026and this, of course, doesn\u2019t happen at school\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cNot even closely. School sometimes becomes a very frustrating experience\u2026 a place of isolation to remind Mario of his diversity. Irene, you are young, you must remember your lectures of geometry, for example\u2026\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cyes, indeed\u2026 mostly graphics are drawn on the blackboard\u2026 I see what you mean\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201ceven our language is geared for the idea that\u00a0<em>seeing is believing</em>. Mario often tells me that he has seen a schoolmate with a certain outfit or some event that he is going to tell me about\u2026 he does enormously to find his place in society. And my husband and I do our maximum to help him surpass the social barriers: we teach him games that he can play with his friends, we accompany him to familiarize with the places where he will have to interact with his mates, and we drill into him, constantly, how to react to the unexpected, hoping that panic will never prevail. Technology, instead of these half-baked attempts at substituting vision for simple tasks, should take on education\u2026 there is so much more that is lost in our societies when one cannot see than just reading on a can whether it is tomato or green peas, and nurturing those skills that we all have as fellow humans, rather than focusing on what we lack, would be so much more empowering.\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cwhat you say is very inspirational\u2026 so you believe education is the true mean of supporting Mario\u2026 and what is the place of technology in your vision?\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cwe live in a time obsessed with technology, and we forget that it is just a tool. I have not hidden from you, I am not a big supporter of the idea. For example, we use the e-reader with voice synthesizer\u2026 the problem is extremely important, but not mission critical, and so the technical solution makes sense\u2026 I am not sure I would delegate to technology, or to other humans for what is worth it, many other things on a regular base\u2026 what would be the meaning of life, if you give up on the very experiences that make it worth sharing and living? We are social animals, someone more important than me said once\u2026\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cMaria, thank you really for letting me peer into your family life\u2026 and thank you for your kind guidance. I hope that we will be able to live to your expectations, but I can already promise you that we will at least try our best!\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cIt has been my pleasure Irene, it is so nice to meet a young person trying with enthusiasm to tackle a problem we have to deal and cope with every day. I wish you the best of luck, and I look forward to hearing about your progress!\u201d\n\nWhen Irene went back to the team after this conversation, she was confused, for having just experienced the most confrontational conversation about their project. Irene was moved emotionally by the passion and interest expressed by the mother. An experience that would leave her forever changed and stretched.\n\nWith Irene insisting, a small group of three people from the original team started diverging from the original path of designing a wearable \u201csmall world\u201d navigation system. They started brainstorming wildly about educational concepts.\n\nIndependently from the rest of the team, which opposed the need to bring to completion the academic assignment, they sought a new agreement with their mentor and started optimal\u00a0thinking at 360\u00ba. Using 3D ultrasound-based haptic interfaces to offer interactive geometry education or simulators for practical tasks that would completely substitute visualization for acoustic and tactile feedbacks?

He knew he had a part to play.

There are around 40 people from the organization who were involved.\u201d \u2013 Abhishek\n\n<strong>Why Sustainable Shelter Project?</strong>\n\n\u201cThe choice was made upon discussion with the staff at the office whose homes in the villages were destroyed. It was necessary to have someone in the know so we could know how much funding we would need to fulfill their need. We chose sustainable shelters because that seemed most appropriate after the need for food, water and temporary settlement had been fulfilled.\u201d\u2013 Abhishek\n\n<strong>Moment of Discovery</strong>\n\n<em>What was it like going in the field? Do you see a different side of the country? A different side of yourself, perhaps?</em>\n\n\u201cRelief work is something that will probably always exist and the wants and needs of those affected are sometimes not very clear. I am proud to be a part of a generation that took the initiative at such a catastrophic time and helped people they had never met and never known. The spirit of camaraderie in Nepal is so strong.\u201d \u2013 Abhishek\n\n<span><span>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/37b65715459c8f29a9b8761c6fa983c8e2e479c4.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br></span></span>\n\n<strong>Stories that stay</strong>\n\n<em>And there are plenty. The overwhelming sense of self and that of our surrounding has not left us yet and it has been a month. Stories are memories that are embedded in our heads to stay. What is Abhishek\u2019s story?</em>\n\n\u201cAn initial step taken by us was working in clearing out the debris at Swayambunath. It required special permission as it is a heritage site and there were fears of idols being stolen. We got the permission and helped clear out some of the clutter and the scene there was one of destitution. Not only the chaitya on the side being broken, but the buildings there were in very bad shape.\u201d \u2013 Abhishek\n\n<strong>Taking more than experience out of it</strong>\n\n<em>If we had to do the relief work again, how could we have made better decisions and bigger impact? We wanted Abhishek to share his experience.</em>\n\n\u201cBetter research, more fundraising so we could help adjacent villages as well.\u201d \u2013 Abhishek\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/772d28c1d6990f3fafbe525dfd2031d159c74803.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\n<strong>Work among teams</strong>\n\n<em>Coordination seems to be working for many teams that I talked to. The team that Abhishek is affiliated to has its own agenda and way of working.</em>\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been much coordination with other teams so far. It is the organization working on its own and using its resources and manpower. We did meet the local police in places who were cordial.\u201d \u2013 Abhishek\n\n<strong>Realizing what is important</strong>\n\n<em>There is better clarity as to what to do in case of a natural disaster. For those who might be affected in the future, we have knowledge to impart for survival.</em>\n\n\u201cThere is another initiative called You Hike They Rise that focuses on the tourism of Nepal. It is a step towards galvanizing the perception of Nepal being a safe tourist destination and needs to be backed as tourism envelopes a huge chunk of the national income. For Nepal to get back on its feet, we need for it to flourish.\u201d \u2013 Abhishek\n\n<em>As I thanked <a href=\"/u/abhishek\">@abhishek</a> for his inputs, I couldn\u2019t help but get intrigued at the prospect of talking to You Hike They Rise.

It has destroyed temples, schools and houses. We have lost a lot of lives but we know the earthquake has also brought all (hopefully) Nepali people together.\n\nBut amidst this chaos and devastation, we have a perfect opportunity to destroy further.\n\nJust like the earthquake, we should and must destroy the structures our societies are built upon: discrimination (based on religion, caste, gender, ethnicity, culture, color and status), superstition, prejudice and injustice. Out of all these, two things come to my mind.\n\nIt was the second day after the earthquake. Every one in our neighbourhood was outside the houses praying and hoping that the quake won\u2019t come back. We were taking shelter under a large tent and started preparing relief-khaja (cheura, noodles and dalmot) for all of us. Suddenly, I heard one respectful elderly woman say to a girl, \u201cnani, timi 2 din ko bhako chau, ali parai basera khau\u201d. You are on the second day of your menstruation, you stay a bit far from us and eat. I couldn\u2019t believe my ears. While everyone\u2019s trying to make sense of what\u2019s happening, this elderly lady was still bothered by the presence of a menstruating girl. Even on the face of terror, some people forget humanity and stick with their own ill-logics.\u00a0\n\nI heard a friend of my sharing his frustrations. He was in Bhaktapur for relief distributions and some people in a Bahun community told them that they won\u2019t take any relief food touched by dalits. It doesn\u2019t make any sense at first, but some people are ready to die in the name of their tradition and culture. These are proud people. Arrogant people.\n\nWithout destroying these cherished structures, we can\u2019t imagine a new nation.\n\nThe second structure is our education system.\n\nThe news says over 20,000 schools have been damaged completely or partially. One million students have been said to be effected. If there\u2019s something to be optimistic about this dismal situation, it is about the opportunity to build new schools, new curriculum and new education policies.\u00a0\n\nAnd as we rebuild the schools, we also need to think about the real purpose of schools and real objectives of education. Our schools reflect factory model (remember, students are referred as \u2018products\u2019). Our curriculum promotes one shot three-hour final exams. Our education promotes obedience. These concepts are obsolete. And these need to be dumped into the Bagmati.\u00a0\n\nLet me clarify why schools are exploitative by prodding on one omnipresent factor in schools \u2013 the fear factor. Schools teach students to be fearful. Fear the teacher. Fear the principal. Fear the exam. Fear the society. Fear the future. And eventually, students fear of being oneself. They fear of being different. They fear of speaking out.\u00a0\n\nFear is the primary weapon our schools wield against students to make them uniform and complaint. Our schools destroy children\u2019s natural inquisitiveness with years of one-right-answer mentality and leave them without spontaneous creativity. And for this travesty to end, the system that demands obedience has to go first. And we need to replace it with one that promotes creativity, critical thinking and independence. We can build our new education system on the foundations of reality, empathy and social justice.\n\nThe earthquake has destroyed our houses and ruined our lives (for now), but we also need to destroy these old structures that has been crippling us. I believe it\u2019s never late to change and this is the perfect time to change. It\u2019s time to build a new hope. A new country where there\u2019s no discrimination. A new country where children grow to be fearless.

Since the sharing time session worked so well and was seemingly more interesting, a next writers\u2019 workshop might consist of just the sharing session (and the presentation sessions before). Not every participant would have to come with a text to share, some might enjoy to hear the comments and discussions when others share, and learn a great deal from that about how to write.

The conversations were coded online and later more in-depth analysis was conducted with RQDA program offline. Posts purely related to the project's organization were excluded from the analysis.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Research questions</h3>\n\nThe in-depth qualitative analysis of the conversations, supplemented by data from a focus group discussion, was intended to highlight who are the grass-root activists in Armenia, Georgia and Egypt, and answer the following questions:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\t\tWhat is the profile of grass-root activists in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia? Is there any cross-country difference?</li>\n\n<li>\t\tWhat is the social reality and challenges that these activists face?</li>\n\n<li>\t\tWhat solutions are they offering?</li>\n\n<li>\t\tWhat are their needs? (==&gt; this one is not in the draft yet. Working on it)</li>\n\n<li>\t\tWhat are the interaction patterns on the horizontal and on vertical dimension?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Limitations:</h3>\n\n(this part needs to be elaborated more)\n\nThe STF project had a limited reach of the organizations, groups and individuals working on the grass-root level for the benefit of the local communities in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia due to the following reasons:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tlanguage barriers</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\treluctance of some users to engage with each other on the Edgeryders platform as opposed to mainstream social networks such as Facebook</li>\n\n<li>\t\ttime scope ( the shorter the time frame, the greater the dependency on the\u00a0social circles of the engagement managers seeding the conversation)</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\u2026.?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThese limitations should be taken into the consideration while preparing reading this report.\u00a0\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">The people</h2>\n\nThe people involved into the grass-root movements in Armenia, Georgia and Egypt can be described as young, socially active and community-oriented persons. They are architects, designers, researchers, development and human rights workers, documentary film makers, engineers, historians, IT specialists, journalists, lawyers, university lecturers, teachers, web developers, volunteers, yoga instructors, and even a pilot. All these people with different background, different education, different spheres of occupation tend to be hungry for changes, socially active, community-oriented and are not afraid to step in and take initiatives in their own hands, not just simply talk about change.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Challenges <span>(this part will be more detailed; each point will be talked in more length) </span>\n\n</h2>\n\nAll the challenges that grass-root activists face and talk about in the STF platform can be roughly grouped into three groups: challenges that they face around them in everyday life (macro level); challenges that they face in their work (meso level); challenges that are faced on a personal level (micro level).\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Macro level challenges.</h3>\n\nThe participants on the on-line discussions discussed challenges connected to the natural environment that they live in, such as climate (for example, very cold winters and very hot summers), landslides, littering, environmental and energy issues. They also are concerned about challenges in their social environment: quality and availability of medical services, quality of public education, illiteracy, poor public infrastructure, lack of public transportation (or its flip side \u2013 traffic jams), poor sanitation, poverty, migration, unemployment, lack of trust in the governmental institutions, lack of publicity and transparency in the public life, high levels of corruption, bad handling of public spaces, various basic human rights issues \u2013 from gender issues and prejudice, to more specific pedestrian and cyclist rights or right to a non-smoking environment.\n\nFor example, an Egyptian described the situation in the educational sector in this country:\n\nHe found out that his kids spend a lot of time in school &lt;...&gt; everyday and they come back exhausted with no energy or time to even study, do their homework and play and they became accustomed to have the easy answer for the questions and not to search for the answers themselves because obviously they have not time or energy to do so, this besides the fact that every day in school he is a sitting passively listening to teachers and the curriculum itself has lots of problems.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Meso level challenges.</h3>\n\nIn their work, STF discussions participants are challenged by bureaucracy, vertical hierarchical systems, problematic relations with governmental institutions, zero-sum competition amongst NGO and the lack of will to collaborate. Also they are tired of traditional top-bottom approach and traditional solutions to existing problems, which in most cases do not work. They experience lack of supporters to their cases, lack of human resources, lack of public and institutional trust in their approaches and their technologies. In addition, there are challenges concerning legislation, funding, finding legal assistance or trying to implement policy changes afterwards.\n\nThis is nicely summed up in a quote below:\n\n<em>What Jumpstart faces in Georgia, is not dissimilar to other countries: there are challenges with building activism, lack of creativity in trying to solve issues, lack of trust in using technology over traditional methods, many organizations are set in their ways. Donor support is often lacking in grassroots, experimental initiatives, which go unnoticed or ignored in favor of 'tried and true' establishments. This creates an environment where it is difficult for large established actors to innovate or experiment, and also keeps creative approaches from reaching their potential through a lack of funding.</em>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Micro level challenges.</h3>\n\nOn a personal level, STF participants presume that there is a lack of team cooperation spirit as the society is more individual-oriented. However, the main challenge is motivation, and the discussants showed that there are different reasons for the lack of it, such as feeling that one can not change anything, no decisions being made on a policy levels, skepticism from the people around, passiveness, lack of support for creative and innovative approaches. Some of these reasons were explained through the cultural values prism. Those who are freelance experience even more problems \u2013 financial insecurity, time management, need to learn to prioritize and so on.\n\nThe quote below is from the discussion following the workshop in Egypt:\n\n<em>&lt;...&gt; basically the challenge was 'things in ourselves we don't like and want to change' - and the common thing that came up was a lack of engagement in activities, indifference and everything being predictable so a belief that your actions won't be effective.</em>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Real Action</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Armenia.</h3>\n\nIn the conversations on the STF platform there were fourteen (albeit overlapping) Armenian initiatives mentioned . Below I give a brief overview of these organizations:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\t\tArmenian Progressive youth. A youth organization aimed at active youth participation and their capacity building;</li>\n\n<li>\t\tCity Bugs. A web-based citizen reporting platform and monitoring system for urban infrastructure issues.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tGarni Community. A community in Garni (close to Yerevan) aiming to establish self-sustainable and eco-friendly community.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tLet's Create Smile. Initiative aimed at integration of disabled youth and children to the larger society; does some charity work as well.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tMashtots Park Movement. A protest movement that began in 2012 in order to save green zones in Yerevan, also expressing the idea that the people are the owners of public places.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tNFE Armenia. Non-formal education initiative from Armenia</li>\n\n<li>\t\tSky School Yerevan. A new initiative by a professional pilot aimed at teaching piloting skills to wider society using flight simulators.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tTa-Ta Moms Helpers. An initiative in Yerevan, that offers baby-sitting services for mothers.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tTumo Center for Creative Technologies. An after-school educational center for children and youth.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tCarpool Armenia. Carpooling initiative started by the leader of the Armenian Progressive Youth organization.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tProject Human. Storytelling initiative in Armenia.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tSave Teghut Forest initiative. It was launched in 2006 in order to stop the Teghut mine exploitation program in Lori, Armenia.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tSwap shop Yerevan. This initiative allows people to exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy. This idea emerged during the STF workshop in Yerevan.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tUtopiaLab. A co-working place in Yerevan, Armenia.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nAlthough all of these initiatives are different in their objectives, there are some common trends. It can be stated that young people in Armenia care about their environment, both rural and urban, and try to be self-sustainable and eco-friendly. Another strong trend in this country is the quest for alternative economy models, when traditional market economy is substituted by sharing and bartering economy. Also young Armenians are concerned about education and aim to gain various skills. They also strive for a more inclusive and more empowered society by offering various help for weaker members.\n\nHence the keywords to describe Armenian grass-root movements would be <em>environment, alternative economy, inclusion, empowerment.</em>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Egypt.</h3>\n\nThere were 27 organizations and initiatives (although overlaying each other) from Egypt mentioned in the STF discussions. Here is a brief overview of them.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\t\tBussy project.

This is the name of a community in Cairo that built a ring-road exit together, by themselves, without asking any assistance (or permission) from the authorities.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAna Mubasher. It is a live streaming project, which was founded in 2012 in order to provide live streaming from ongoing demonstrations in Cairo and other places in Egypt connected to the Arabic Spring uprisings. It became a channel that documented authority's abuses of their power when dealing with protesters.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAnti Harassment movement. The initiative aimed to change the perceptions of harassment in society by approaching potential harassers on individual basis and trying to work on the core of the problem.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tArkeb Eh. An initiative that offers an app that informs what public transport to use when traveling from point A to point B in Cairo.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tBiogas People. It is an initiative to develop biological gas systems in order to provide more eco-friendly and cheaper energy source that would be accessible by everyone.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tBos 7awalek. It is a campaign aimed at reducing traffic and increasing visibility for local businesses by using billboards on the street. It will offer a mobile application that contains a directory of various services with directions, proximity and ratings. It is a new initiative, still in the planning stage.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tCairo sitters. A baby-sitting agency.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tCluster Cairo.

A youth-led nonprofit organization based in Alexandria that aims at empowering youth and building their capacity to become effective leaders in the near future.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tGozoor. A company that reuses agricultural waste by designing machines to produce wood from the palm reeds.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tHarassMap. This project aims to create a system in Egypt for reporting incidences of sexual harassment via SMS messaging. By mapping these reports on-line, the entire system will act as an advocacy, prevention, and response tool, highlighting the severity and pervasiveness of the problem.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tIce Cairo. A small-scale innovation hub for youth.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tJozour. The company manufactures wood products from palm midribs.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tKartag.com. A carpooling app that connects drivers with passengers.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tMapture. It is an application that track the phone from its GPS and allows to verify the time and the location of the picture taken.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tMedicine for All. A system of collecting, sorting, and distributing medicine that would otherwise be thrown away by individuals and pharmaceutical companies.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tNoat Nour. Facilitators of the Oasis Game.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tOasis Game. A participatory asset based community development methodology. Organized by Noat Nour.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tRasheed22.

They design a range of furniture using a material created out of plastic bags.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tSmart Gates. The Automatic Smart Gates is an invention that helps dealing with an access of rain water.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIn addition to that, during the STF workshop in Egypt, a new initiative was born, called the Future Now newspaper. It is an imaginative exercise which helped the participants put their version of the future into the concrete stories.\n\nIn Egypt, eco-friendly initiatives stand out, such as recycling and reusing materials or converting waste to an eco-friendly energy source. Also the Egyptians care about their urban environment and are taking active part in its planning and changing (the ring road initiative). The are concerned about gender issues and education as well. Community development, solidarity and capacity building, as well as media improvement \u2013 these are other themes that occurred amongst initiatives from Egypt.\n\nTherefore the keywords that would describe Egyptian grass-root movements would be <em>eco-friendly, urban planning, gender issues, education, development, solidarity </em>and<em> media improvement.</em>\n\nHowever: from the personal feedback in Tbilisi showed that the results from the STF platform are quite different from the real on-the-ground situation: environmental organizations/initiatives are scarce (the opposite from what is on the platform). Possible reasons: the STF initiative was spread in Egypt by environmental organizations, hence their circle is highly represented. Other explanations \u2013 limitation of the STF scope.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Georgia.</h3>\n\nThere were 30 initiative and projects (overlapping with each other) from Georgia mentioned in the STF forum discussions.

It is an event aimed at making cities more cycle friendly. The idea is to bring people together to come up with ideas that solve the barriers to cycling and build them in under 48 hours. The main Cyclehack event will be held in Edinburgh, with satellite events being held all around the world. On June 21st it is planned to be held in Tbilisi.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nAs it can be seen, the Georgians put emphasis on art, innovative IT approaches (maps, apps and data visualization), urban planning and urban/environmental activism, gender issues, healthy and active lifestyle, cycling and walking, charity, media.\n\nIn addition to that, in Georgia a lot of initiatives are driven not only by Georgians, but also expats living in this country. This illustrates that in Georgia changes on the grass-root level is driven by a blend of local and global expertise. (any other reasons?)\n\nThe keywords that would describe Georgian grass-root scene drawing from the STF platform would be <em>IT, urban planning, environmental, gender issues, safety</em> (in the road/on the sidewalk), <em>solidarity, media</em>.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Approaches</h2>\n\nAs we can see, there are different organizations and initiatives at work in Armenia, Georgia and Egypt. However, there are some things that all of them have in common. First of all is <strong>a belief in bottom-up approach and that changes can be delivered locally and on a small-scale first</strong>. Cooperation was another theme that underlined the conversations in the STF forum. <strong>People from Armenia, Egypt and Georgia start by sharing their experiences, then looking for common goals and common resources that they have and later opt for real action, instead of just networking.</strong>\n\nAlthough some of the participants can be called true-born leaders that started certain initiatives by themselves (for example Carpool Armenia), but the strength, believe the Edgeryders from all three countries, lies in a strong team of people who share the same ideas.\n\nOn one hand the grass-root activists are taking after DIY, arts-and-crafts, simple engineering, sustainable living initiatives, but on the other hand they also rely a lot on the newest technologies and open-source data: using maps and geographical data for information and for advocacy seems to be a panacea from everything \u2013 harassment, road safety, carpooling, trustworthy media and so on.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Vertical and horizontal relations:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tCooperation (perceived lack of, changes during and after STF);</li>\n\n<li>\t\trelations with governmental institutions: problematic, what are the possibilities? (still ongoing discussion on the STF platform). From focus group: govt resistant to change, similar to feudal system, enemies, avoid direct work with public institutions, preferencial treatment of some NGOs. There is a need of more publicity, public need to be more educated about NGO-state relations, state is against public improving things on their own, but there is a need to work together.</li>\n\n<li>\t\trelations with donor institutions: what does work and what does not? (still ongoing discussion on the STF platform). From focus group: some people are not aware of funding possibilities, different donors, different approaches, fund-chasing leads to no outcomes, donors impose their conditions and you have to fit into their boxes with goals set from outside.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-06 21:59:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:18.080512", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4118, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 35.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6587, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 2678, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Welcome on board!</b>\n\nHello dear Andranik!\n\nI am very glad to see you here!\n\n<span>I think this platform has a huge potential to help the yoga / wushu / holistic health scene in <span>Armenia</span> to develoop and spread even more, because here you can find people from many different cultures and backgrounds, and this space is really full of ideas, skills and perspectives!

Is it not a matter of how much functionality but rather functionality that is both easier to maintain and manage as well as easier for the user to understand? \u00a0I am pretty sure that is a main driver of going away from Drupal, based on what I remember Matt saying.\n\nIt seems like we're a little stuck in nomencalture. \u00a0And for me, the ER site already has a lot of that. \u00a0Posts, wikis, blogs, events, challenges, stories, projects, channels and others I am surely leaving out. \u00a0My first question is do we want to retain and present that kind of complexity to the MENA YP people and do we want the Platform we develop\u00a0to have all those choices presented in the farily simultanous way that we do now? \u00a0One has to sort of wrestle with the ER\u00a0platform for awhile to get it, to really grasp it. \u00a0I find that it rewards people who come in and don't know that much about what is going on yet (we help with \"start here\" and \"tell your story\" and \"what's new\" etc), and real power users who have worked out some of their own efficiencies on how to get work\u00a0done using the site. \u00a0I wind up leaving a ton of tabs open and going back to them, often wondering, \"what's this one about again?\"\n\nSo now we have Discourse that wants to call certain things by certain names. \u00a0Thus, more nomencalture discussion over what we call something. \u00a0But really, it's how do we want to present the site and its tools to people? \u00a0We have worked on the UI of the current site and as I recall it is not fully to where you want it to be. \u00a0We don't want to reinvent the wheel here if we want to keep good design and ideas, but it is also an opportunity to change things. \u00a0But that will be within the boundaries of the Ruby/Rails CMS environment\u00a0and its templates and added applications. \u00a0I set up and ran a Joomla site for the radio station and I don't think it is terribly different from Ruby as a manageable CMS system.\n\nSo do you want us to come up with a visual map of what it is we want and see if we can get Ruby/Rails to do it?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-09 02:10:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.784850", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 578, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30407], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7261, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3421, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Nerd joke</b>\n\nIt is a play on \"no\u00a0<em>animals</em>\u00a0were inconvenienced doing X\" (for example, shooting a film).

I think I am learning new things on how to use\u00a0collective intelligence in practice. This has far-reaching implications for my own work in Edgeryders, and beyond.\u00a0\u00a0<em>Far</em>\u00a0beyond, in fact.\u00a0If we crack collective intelligence, we gain access to a new source of cognition. Forget my own work; this has profound implications for the future of our species. If you think that's radical,\u00a0go read the work of cultural evolution scholars, like\u00a0Boyd, Richerson or\u00a0<a href=\"http://secretofoursuccess.fas.harvard.edu/\">Henrich</a>. They think\u00a0<em>homo\u00a0sapiens\u00a0</em>has started\u00a0a major transition: evolutionary forces are pulling us towards a larger, more integrated \"collective brain\". We are en route\u00a0to becoming to primates what ants are to flies.\u00a0\n\nCollective intelligence is an\u00a0elusive concept. It appeals to intuition, but it is hard to define and harder to measure\u00a0and model. And yet, model it we must if we are to go forward. The good news is: I think I see a possible way.\u00a0What follows is just a \u00a0back-of-the-envelope note, plotting a rough\u00a0course for the next three years or so.\u00a0\n\n<h3>1. Data model: semantic social networks</h3>\n\nI submit that the raw data of collective intelligence are in the form of <strong>semantic social networks</strong>. By this term I mean a way to represent human conversation. The representation is a social network, because it involves humans connected to each other by interactions. And it is semantic, because those interactions encode meaning.\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5d26e41fccaab38ae133409e1f6f8ba1c411528e.jpeg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\n<h3>2. Network science: it's all in the links.\u00a0</h3>\n\nCollective intelligence is not additive: it's interactional. We can only generate new insight when\u00a0the information in my head comes into contact with the information in yours. So, what makes a collectivity more or less\u00a0smart is the pattern of linking across its members. <strong>Network science</strong> is what allows a rigorous study of that linking, looking for the patterns of interaction which associate to the smartest behaviors.\u00a0\n\n<h3>3. Ethnography: harvesting smart outcomes</h3>\n\nSuppose we accept that\u00a0the hive mind can generate\u00a0powerful insights and breakthroughs. How can we, individual human beings, lift them from the surrounding noise? Looking at what individual members of the community say and\u00a0do would likely be fruitless. The problem is understanding how\u00a0<em>the group</em>\u00a0represents\u00a0to itself the issue at hand; no individual you ask will be able to hold all the complexity in her head. We do have a discipline that specializes in this task: <strong>ethnography</strong>. Ethnographers are good at representing a collective point of view on something. Their skills are useful to understand\u00a0just what the\u00a0collective intelligence is saying.\n\n<h3>4. \"Shallow\" text analytics: casting your net wider</h3>\n\nEthnography is like a surgical knife: super sharp and precise. But sometimes you what you need is a machete. As I write this, the opencare conversation consists of over 300,000 words, authored by 137 people. This is a\u00a0<em>very</em>\u00a0big study by ethnography standards, and these numbers are likely to double again. We are already pushing the envelope of what ethnographers can process.\u00a0\n\nSo, the next step is giving them prosthetics. The natural tool\u00a0is <strong>text analytics</strong>, a branch of data analysis centered on text-as-data. It comes in two flavors: shallow-and-robust and deep-and-ad-hoc. I like the shallow flavor best: it is intuitive and relatively easy to make into standard tools. When the time of your ethnographers is scarce and the raw data is abundant, you can use text analysis to find and discard contributions that are likely to be irrelevant or off topic.\u00a0\n\n<h3>5. Machine learning: weak AI for more cost-effective analysis</h3>\n\nBeyond the simplest levels, text analytics uses a lot of machine learning techniques. It comes with the territory: human speech does not come easy to machines.\u00a0At\u00a0best, computers can evolve algorithms that mimic classification decisions made by skilled humans. A close\u00a0cooperation between humans and machines just makes sense.\u00a0\n\n<h3>6. Agent-based modelling: understanding emergence by simulation</h3>\n\nWe do not yet have a strong intuition for how interacting individuals give rise to emergent collective intelligence. Agent-based models can help us build that intuition, as they have done in the past for other emergent phenomena.\u00a0For example, Craig Reynolds's <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3bTqWsVqyzE\">Boids model</a> explains\u00a0flocking behaviour very well.\u00a0\n\nThe above defines the \"long game\" research agenda for Edgeryders. And it's already under way.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>I am knee-deep in network science since 2009. We run real-time social network analysis on Edgeryders with <a href=\"/sites/all/modules/edgesense/static/dashboard.html\">Edgesense</a>.\u00a0We have developed an event format called <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2-9z0i5fuvE\">Masters of Networks</a> to spread the culture beyond the usual network nerds like myself. All good.</li>\n\n<li>We collaborate with ethnographers since 2012. We have developed <a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer\">OpenEthnographer</a>, our own tool to do in-database ethno coding\u00a0I'd love\u00a0to have a blanket agreement with an anthropology department: there is potential for groundbreaking methodological innovation in the discipline.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>We are working with the University of Bordeaux to build a dashboard for semantic social network analysis.</li>\n\n<li>I still need to learn a lot. I am studying agent-based modelling right now. Text analytics and machine learning are next, probably starting towards the end of 2016.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWith that said, it's early days. We are several breakthroughs short of a real mastery of collective intelligence. And without a lot of hard, thankless wrangling with the data, we will have no breakthrough at all. So... better get down to it. It is a super-interesting journey, and I am delighted and honored to be along for the ride. I look forward to making whatever modest contribution I can.\n\n<em>Photo credit: jbdodane on flickr.com CC-BY-NC</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-17 15:27:18", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 16:42:01.174166", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1138, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 52.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22690, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6123, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Try this</b>\n\nHe's quite senior: google Fernando Vega-Redondo at EUI, in Florence.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-11 14:28:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:06.193089", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22339], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12010, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 3001, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Welcome!</b>\n\n<span>Great to have you here!

And one of the things sometimes driving me crazy in Georgia is that so many people are actively avoiding decision, always looking for someone else to be the decision maker. \u00a0 I know what you meant, but can we label it \u00a0civil society and government, not civil society and government? Just to make sure taht everyone needs to make decisions :)</span>\n\n2.<span> I work for the Government of Georgia, funded by a donor. \u00a0 There's no lack of donors talking about civil society, civil society talking about the government, government talking about the donors,... What I lacking is \u00a0people talking WITH each other, not just about each other. In my perception several civil society people in Georgia are so used to government-bashing \u00a0that they don't even try to find the right people to talk to anymore</span>\n\n3. <span>Tbilisi City Hall is problematic, yes. But it#s a very political situation which in these extreme is in my view not representative for all of Georgia, and most of all it#snot chiselled in stone.

I do agree that too many meetings are in Sheraton, Holiday Inn, Marriott etc., finding new locations has my full support. \u00a0 But \u00a0it's often the donors - or Georgian NGOS, not the government, choosing this location. \u00a0All civil society conferences I've been to have been at Sheraton etc. as well. I recently met the director of a company organizing events for UN. Can't find he card or remember her name. But there is a sub-contractor organizing conferences, meetings etc. for UN, so if UN is interested in out of the box locations I think this organization should be included to clarify options.\u00a0</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-07 10:13:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.613354", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 746, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 3, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5110, "user_id": 3011, "topic_id": 5077, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>We are witnessing today a steady growth in the impact of user-generated content and peer-production on the so-called sharing or collaborative economy. These emergent practices are an indicator of radical changes in the mode of production in an age of \u2018prosumerism\u2019, characterized by two main trends. On the one hand, corporations such as Google, Uber or Facebook are capturing the value created by the actors contributing to the collaborative economy, in a way that has been described by some scholars as an exploitation of free labour. On the other hand, projects such as Wikipedia or GNU/Linux are emblematic of a new model of production that relies on the contribution of many individuals collaborating to a collective project that is not owned by any given entity but rather by the community as a whole (Commons-Based Peer Production or CBPP). These individuals organise themselves \u00a0without relying on traditional hierarchical and mercantile organisational structures, to produce a set of commons resources which are made freely available to the public for use and reuse. In the last few years, CBPP has expanded beyond the field of software and encyclopedias to also cover the realms of \u00a0information (OpenStreetMap, Wikihow), hardware (FabLabs, Open Source Ecology), accommodation (Couchsurfing, BeWelcome) and currency (Bitcoin, Altcoins).</span>\n\n<span>The concept of decentralisation is a key requisite for the protection of these commons \u2014 from their governance system, including the allocation \u00a0of power and functions in the organisation of labour; to the characteristics of the socio-technical means \u00a0of collaboration, in terms of both the underlying technical infrastructure and the ownership structure of such infrastructure.

For the past few days we have been watching the evolution of unMonastery and wondering about a possible cooperation with it. To start, we would like to suggest you to upload any kind of location and event related to unMonastery, starting with your very first experience in Matera. We intend to think about possible ways to help you, and we are asking you to do the same.\n\nFor now you could comment or write me at ebecattini@tropicodellibro.it and tell me your thoughts on all those ideas.\n\nThank you all and hope to hear from you soon!\n\nEdoardo\n\n", "created_at": "2014-02-10 16:48:04", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 08:56:21.316831", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 453, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31743, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4746, "post_number": 22, "raw": "<b>No...</b>\n\n... but <a href=\"/u/melancon\">@melancon</a>\u00a0wrote them earlier today, insisting there is nothing more we can do and they have to suggest a way out.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-09-07 13:43:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:54.474284", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 34, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 35.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31661], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14294, "user_id": 3331, "topic_id": 5995, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Questions</b>\n\nHi @Noemi I just attended the presentation \u00a0in milan and hoped for\u00a0some \u00a0discussions.

Formal politics not leading to a better future or present\n\nIf we want to change it\u2019s not about political programs or manifestos. Change comes from the edge and seeps into the centre. If the edge and centre disconnect how do you create the conditions for change? These communities we are discovering\u00a0need to be articulating demands which are somehow legible to politicians.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\tYou need to look towards satisfying material needs of those who are seeking these changes. People lose steam, no business model for this work (the equivalent of unMonastery)</li>\n\n<li>\tMany initiative reinvent the wheel, not learning from each other,\u00a0and make unnecessary mistakes because collaboration between these initaitives are too time consuming</li>\n\n<li>\tThe demands don\u2019t gel together to create new constituentinces to drive political change (bring new people into politics ad remove the old)</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nCommunities try to fix their own worlds, based on what works for them. In order to solve the above, you need to have:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\tunMonasteries or equivalent\u00a0in communities for long enough to foster true collaboration and trust between community and innovators\u00a0- especially in damaged communities</li>\n\n<li>\tIncentivise projects and people to work through ER ways (documentation and online communication), understand that\u00a0the world is big and they have allies.</li>\n\n<li>\tTeaching people to use the collective intelligence methods to\u00a0understand, articulate insights\u00a0and make very concrete demands</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nHealth and social care is the number one destroyer or communities ability to be self sufficient. Care is such a point of vulnerability: the biggest challenge is getting time for a doctor/GP to see you. But it's\u00a0also the fastest way to develop trust in a community to provide health services. Time and person to person contact.\u00a0\n\nHow do we get there?\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\tGo out a meet groups that are already doing these things. Build relationships with them. We have to go see and share the truth and realities with others.</li>\n\n<li>\tBuild local alliances with local funders and community leaders (informal)</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Build allies. Build a reef with a already attached community</h3>\n\nNoemi: Do\u00a0we have to structure for how collaboration can pan out, how long it takes? Not everywhere we go and ideas sparkle we can make things happen. It takes time and a certain skillset to seize\u00a0these opportunities.\u00a0- Is Galway an example of developing in a hands off way?\n\nNadia: Yes, We have to have plan the growth\u00a0and take time on the ground with communities. We have to be concrete and clear in our planning. People looking for guidance and a path. Desperate times. A plan will help bring people towards us.\n\nWhat is the Village?\n\nMeeting space for community groups. A place to teach documentation.\n\nFind spaces that can create permanent UnMon buildings.\n\nShort term - a festival, 3 week event where 1st week people are building their houses; demo spaces where people can walk in + living spaces; barnraising to build shared infrastructure: big building in the middle with kitchen, showers and all.. You need a building master. \u00a0Find land build tiny houses (1600E) for sleeping and running mini demos of initiatives.\n\n- The Edgeryders Caravanserai/ Travelling Circus.\u00a0\n\nConcept translated by Alex:\u00a0<strong>The POPUP VILLAGE as a\u00a0caravan where one can pitch in with small mobile spaces which come together and wagon up into a communal space.</strong>\n\nIn the middle you build a shared space with communal parts. This builds communal shared interest in the space and creates a permanent base for operations in that space for the future. Barnraising both as metaphor and literally.\n\nAlex:\u00a0Highly mobile, low cost traveling is a great way of seeding ideas, but as we go further into new places we will make visible deeper problems, more contextualized. There is no holistic way of building a series of unMonasteries, each will need to grow organically out of the place.\n\nNadia: the concept of INCHOME: permanently affordable selfsufficient homes; it doesnt need to be for everyone, it needs to be for the driving forces of these initiatives, as the coordination costs nobody wants to shoulder; you need people that are ok with themselves to be ok with others.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">We need a plan: \"There's going to be a permanent space\" / with function, dates, timeline, deliverables.</h3>\n\nDo we reach out to cities for this?\n\nNatalia:\u00a0it's about finding what's already there and highlighting it.\n\nLong term leases from cities. Needs space from the city. Must have permanence built in from the start. We need local allies in the place.\n\nPossible places: Portugal and lagging regions; UK but not for longterm;\u00a0\n\nThe lagging places aren't those which dont really have active communities. There can be just motivation!\n\nAna:\u00a0Armenian ICA in Yerevan; lots of abandoned land and cheap houses in rural areas.\n\nActionables:\n\nCOMM PACKAGE + CALL FOR SPONSORS\n\n1st newsletter of Jan outlines the PLAN\n\n+ attachment Comm Pack and Sponsorship Pack (Do you want to finance this house?) Finance home by home; Let's build two more; Do shareholding.\n\n<strong>Note about crowdfunding for mini houses</strong> - If you contribute money towards the houses you get your name or face on a tile :P\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-10 16:43:52", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 14:56:10.030968", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1083, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29579, "user_id": 52, "topic_id": 1355, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>the method</b>\n\nCiao Stefano!

He is looking for solutions that would alleviate conflicts between peoples. If the authorities fail to reach an agreement, never mind, it does not stop Tiago, who realized that civilians are ready to move on and aspire only to live a life of calm and harmony. He concocted his \"plan\" of action and he is ready to test it. See his report \"<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/spotlight-social-innovation/mission_case/ive-got-plan\">I've got a plan!</a>\"\n\nThis young designer for Social development with a beaming face is gifted to free spirits and push people to creativity. \"<em>Let yourself go, do not be afraid to dream</em>,\" he will tell you. Because he knows that one must first let the imagination work in order for projects to be realized, for it is in the willingness to enter into the unknown that exists the field of all possibilities. Tiago helps people to surrender to the creative mind that orchestrates the dance of life. I find it rather remarkable that Tiago, at such a young age, has developed the wisdom of uncertainty. He is not afraid to lead others to make uncertainty their way to freedom. Read his report entitled \"<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/life-journey\">Life Journey</a>\".\n\nIn a jiffy, he will quickly help you visualize your ideas by sketching links between them.

Defenders of peace and other universal causes, what are you waiting for? Come and recruit him!\n\nP.S. Note to girls: Since he is capable of universal love, he will love you as you are and for what you are. Those who are afraid to love, please refrain...\n\n<em>Tell us</em><em> what you like about Tiago. What thoughts crossed your mind when reading his reports?

(3 person per kilo? or 4? \u2013 250 gr per person, is it enough?)\n\n3. Joining professional ones (or experienced) with the first doers for the execution, as proposed by @valentinabrogna.\n\n    Probably experienced people could \"raise their hands\" for awareness of how many are there? allowing us to recognize the existent proportion to unexperienced ones.\n\n    I imagine that the idea, @valentinabrogna, is grouping for learning and doing on site, right? (Something like, 1doerPRO to 6 doersAM ?)\n\n\nDo you think it is a good idea including the local younger community members, like teens, to also participate in the organization, if any is interested? (for instance, to animate people doing pasta, as refered by @valentinabrogna before.)\n\nShould we launch a local invitation?

( I am missing a lot of what's happening on the opencare side )\n\n2. I am afraid that the project in the end can tend to go in the direction of sustainble tourism; getting involved in initiating this in the town is quite a good chance but it can get us outside of the scope of the open village MENA. ( if it became dominant in the space  ) \n\n3. On the Brewery and \"on-boarding women\" issues, this is very tricky as it could brand the open village as an alien project trying to plant roots in the region rather than getting integrated within.\n\n    Starting a Brewery could be hostile for many other potential collaborators.\n\n    Women, in my opinion, should be involved in the physical space; Whatever the space looks like in the end but it's a challenge we have to solve. As \"depending on local women\" + \"everything is slow in the desert and we shouldn't relay on local collaborators\" = [ could end up with] no women ( at least not from the region)\n\n4. Open village as a lab\n\n    Tarfya is [going to be] connected to Europe but for other MENA countries it is still \"far\".\n\n    Being a lab/prototype/proof of concept in a far small town comes a lot of opportuinities and risks as well.\n\n    Being there could be perfect for some projects ( off-grid tech, farming, bio-related.......etc) but for social projects it is outside of the mess and doesn't offer much than a relaxing place to work.\n\n    I have lived for a while in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Gouna\">El-gouna</a> ( it's kinda lab also but its totally another story, a privately developed \"town\" or in other words a rich man's fanatasy ) El-gouna is functioning well, they even call it a \"town\" with good PR as living there is \"live as it should be\". It is actually good as a lab for energy and water works, but imagine studying there urban development (which I did) . In other words, El-gouna is a bubble inside Egypt and has nothing to do with Egypt ( of course there are some indirect interactions like , well myself and other gouna temporary residents and workers ) and I am afraid Tarfya could tend to be an isolatd bubble as well. ( this seems to be a very off-topic example but hey El-gouna was and is a crazy idea as well but in another context and ironically known for kitesurfing )\n\nOn the other hand Tarfya seems to offer a lot and we are ( and can ) steer the project, am just being crtitical to some potential scenarios.  worth mentioning that \"Tarfya\" in arabic comes from \"Tarf\" which means \"edge\" :D - I am not sure if means something else in the Morrocan dialect or other language -  but also I think we could set a deadline to see other alternatives as well (to compare between one option as Tarfya and another in a bigger city or so).", "created_at": "2017-07-09 15:40:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:51.614632", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 558, "wiki": false, "reads": 30, "score": 21.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13797, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4415, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Color codes</b>\n\nI have them in this format:\u00a0red is \\#F15C32, blue is \\#2AACE2, grey is \\#5A5B5D\n\nIt's very generous of you to pick up on this logo thing.

I\u2019ve worked a lot with refugees, doing legal orientation, helping them to find houses, jobs, but also writing projects to get funds to create new spaces of inclusion.\n\nFor me it\u2019s interesting to see how many edgeryders are interested in migration or refugee issues and what are the connections to spring up from the many well known problems of working with refugees. I think that it\u2019s possible to underline some key issues when talking about care in this context .\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Helping Relationships vs Peer Relationships</li>\n\n<li>Know your rights vs Rights as a cage</li>\n\n<li>Intercultural problems and Empathy</li>\n\n<li>Inclusiveness in our society/community: avoid ideological and too theoretical approach</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nA little bit about my experience: In particular I would like to speak about my working period during the so called \u201cNorth \u00a0Africa Emergency\u201d for 3 years. It was a really hard situation for our (Italian) reception system. We were in the paradoxical situation to tell them: \u201cyou are an asylum seeker, you HAVE to be an asylum seeker, if you want to have any chances to stay in Europe\u201d.\n\nIn effect after the Arab Spring Revolution (2011) everything changed. A lot of people that came from Horn of Africa or from other Sub Saharian regions and were in Libya for work decided to come in Europe. Gaddafi\u2019s death meant the end of every agreement \u201cPetrol vs Migrants\u201d that Italian Government had signed with Berlusconi in 2009 (for more details, this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/14/gaddafi-berlusconi-refugees-human-rights\">Guardian article</a>). So you\u2019d have more asylum seekers in Europe, but also different routes, different countries of origin, different reasons to leave their countries.\n\nIn 2011 asylum seekers in Italy were more than 40.000 (4 times more than 2010, <a href=\"http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=migr_asyappctza&amp;lang=en\">Eurostat</a>) and Italy became the fourth country for the number of claims submitted, mainly from Nigeria,Tunisia, Ghana and Mali. Most of them have lived for many years in Libya, illiterate in their own native language, living in segregated conditions of work or in the terrible detention centers.\n\nThe history is long and I\u2019 don\u2019t want to become boring, but <strong>only to say that it\u2019s not possible to speak about refugees in general when trying to be of real help.</strong> We have to think about the countries where we are and where they come from (for example 90% of Syrian refugees that arrived in Italy decided not to ask asylum here, but in other north EU countries), the migration routes, the particular war conditions, but also the economical ones..\n\nFor all these reasons it was hard to prepare asylum seekers during North Africa Emergency because they came here for Lybian crisis and most didn\u2019t leave their countries for reasons of \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d (<a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/protect/PROTECTION/3b66c2aa10.pdf\">Geneva Convention</a>) or for war crisis in their countries (<a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0083:en:HTML\">subsidiary protection</a>). And so it was difficult to explain them that formally they have to be asylum seekers, that we need to find these elements in their stories. How could we help them? I usually do some group or individual meetings to inform them about procedures, about what does it mean to ask asylum and I prepare them for the Audition. How to help them to underline important elements in their stories, not lying... A lot of also ethical questions..(Legislation vs Reality)\n\n<strong>A relation of care: teaching a foreign language</strong>\n\nThe relations between us is a relation of help. Sometimes you can help someone too much.\n\nThe question is more to create opportunities for people to be really active (refugees as \\#nospectators). There are language barriers, cultural misunderstandings, different contexts of life, different expectations.\n\nIn this complex and nonlinear context of work that I would like to start from the first point: the challenge to learn a new language, the language of the recipient country. It could be difficult and, in some situations, also impossible, like a WALL.\n\nThis could be because learning a language means that you accept to be in a country, you decide to start again your life. For a lot of vulnerable people that are victims of violence (in their countries of origin or during the migration travel) it could become a catalyst of bed experiences.\n\nSo learning a language becomes the first step to say: \u201cI\u2019m here. I would like to take part in this new society and new community.\u201d\n\nFor all these reasons we needed to share knowledge and experiences about \u201chow to teach in more effective way?\u201d, we needed to create a community - or better to create a space for a community of italian schools! So we started with: www.milano.Italianostranieri.org\n\nIt is a platform of the Municipality of Milan to help foreigners find a school of Italian; there are a lot of problems to find the right schools, also because there are a lot of schools but not connected.\n\nWe saw that there is this tendency to work alone, providing a service but without \u00a0sharing knowledge, critical points.. We knew people that attend 3 different classes, for months, \u00a0but they couldn\u2019t speak Italian!\n\nSo we decided to open our website to every school, private, public, run by volunteers, by NGOs.\n\nIt\u2019s not simple to help, to take care of someone. It\u2019s a relation full of responsibilities, and good intentions often aren\u2019t enough. We noticed also some schools that are so active in helping their students, helping them in legal stuff or finding jobs.. But all these activities could be dangerous, create a bubble, a dependence relation, mixed with ideological thoughts ..\n\nYour students are not yours.\n\nTo create a community we realized \u00a0real life meetings between teachers and schoolmakers. Every school has the possibility to post directly activities, news. So everyone can have an always updated map of time classes, levels, locations etc; But also a moment of exchange between teachers, methods and materials. The teachers all together wrote also an <a href=\"http://milano.italianostranieri.org/it/pg/guida-intergalattica-per-il-pianeta-l2\">handbook for teachers (in Italian only)</a>. We also created an <a href=\"http://milano.italianostranieri.org/it/search/e-learning\">e-learning database</a> to help people to find free resources on internet and a lot of <a href=\"http://milano.italianostranieri.org/ar/post/mrf-at-lytly-at-mn-jl-lmysh-at-wlml-f~-ytly\">videos (in 5 languages) to explain Laws. Education system...</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>I\u2019ve been asked what projects I think can really make a difference: </strong>Projects that work on the concept of <a href=\"http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic920418.files/arc_1_10refandpsych-1.pdf\">resilience,</a>\u00a0avoid that people identify themselves with their own pain.\n\nWe saw a lot of people that 5 or 6 months after their arrival start to fade, to turn off. During the first months you hope that your rights became effective, job, home.. But nothing happens. Your life becomes full of complaints.\n\nA very interesting school that is part of the community is for example, <a href=\"http://milano.italianostranieri.org/it/locations/asnada-onlus\">Asnada</a>. It\u2019s a Montessori/Experimental\u00a0school. The idea is to teach in a different way. Helping people to use this new language not as a \u201cstranger\u201d language. Usually you start to have 2 languages: the native one that is the language of feelings and relationships and a second language that is the language of bureaucracy. The idea is to teach a language that helps you to construct your new identity, \u201ccreate your new life here in a new language\u201d.\n\nSo the lessons became a workshop where we, all together, construct the language, with different ways, methods (arts, music, plays..) and also being a community.\n\nSo in my opinion it\u2019s really important to be able to find new ways to take care, creating effective spaces of meeting, of real exchange.\n\n<strong>Work on resilience, opening workshops where people can create something (for ex. FabLabs, Makerspaces..) using open technologies (like Raspberry Pi) could become new ways to take care of people in really big troubles, with strong vulnerabilities and help them to start again.</strong>\n\nMaybe Opencare, Edgeryders community could be the right place where to start!!\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-25 09:44:02", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 16:26:57.302967", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1549, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 51.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22274, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 6167, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>agenda being finalised</b>\n\nHi @noemi, @melancon and I are still making the final arrangements for the meeting in Bordeaux, but I hope to post more info and to confirm you the schedule this week.", "created_at": "2017-05-15 14:59:40", "updated_at": "2018-03-03 06:33:56.745166", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 36, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21174], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21624, "user_id": 116, "topic_id": 2445, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>so how</b>\n\nok to your point one. it will be a good conversation\u00a0\n\nok i can fix with a wifi (as i do normally with pc) so i ll have the best (3) connection possibile\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-02 16:07:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:00.363682", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 42, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19861, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4789, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Vivid and beautiful!</b>\n\nOnly seeing this now, well done everyone.

Mais le genre humain comporte deux sexes, le masculin et le f\u00e9minin. Cessons de parler de l'Homme, voulez-vous, et parlons plut\u00f4t d'Humanit\u00e9. Ou de genre humain.\n\nC'est pareil avec les langues.\n\nL'ANGLAIS NE CONVIENT PAS \u00c0 TOUTES LES SITUATIONS. Il faut s'enlever cela de la t\u00eate. Il est temps de r\u00e9viser tout cela, et cesser d'entretenir une certaine complaisance reposant sur l\u2019absence de mise en place de strat\u00e9gies de communication multilingue.\n\nNous le voyons tr\u00e8s clairement avec la pr\u00e9sentation vid\u00e9o des Edgeryders, c'est un fait, il y a des gens qui ne comprennent pas l'anglais. L'exemple de Lucas Gonzalez, qui a traduit l'outil de pr\u00e9sentation des Edgeryders de sa propre initiative, en est la preuve flagrante. En moins d'une semaine, cet outil de pr\u00e9sentation a \u00e9t\u00e9 traduit b\u00e9n\u00e9volement en 7 langues par des gens, qui l'ont fait par pure g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9, parce qu'ils pensent qu'une langue autre que l'anglais est une bonne chose. J'ai vraiment tr\u00e8s h\u00e2te de voir jusqu'\u00e0 combien de langues la communaut\u00e9 poussera cette exp\u00e9rience collective de strat\u00e9gie multilingue. Encore une autre langue - une huiti\u00e8me traduction - et nous d\u00e9passerons le nombre de langues que Government in the Lab a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 atteindre cette ann\u00e9e. Dans quelques jours, ce projet ira, un peu \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re de l'Enterprise, <em>'where no man has gone before</em>'. (Rempla\u00e7ons le mot 'man' par genre humain, voulez-vous, mon petit c\u00f4t\u00e9 f\u00e9ministe se rebelle.) Ce n'est pas rien, ce qui se passe avec l'appropriation de la vid\u00e9o par la communaut\u00e9. Cela parle fort, je trouve. (Fin de cette parenth\u00e8se.)\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.aoltv.com/media/2006/10/enterprise_distantgalaxy.jpg\" style=\"width: 320px; height: 255px;\">\n\nDonc, avant de m'attarder sur cet exemple concret, j'\u00e9tais en train d'expliquer que l'anglais ne convient pas \u00e0 toutes les situations. L'anglais r\u00e9gnait en ma\u00eetre sur la toile web, informatique oblige. Mais cette tendance est en train de s'inverser. Les internautes ne semblent pas pr\u00eats \u00e0 se couler dans cette \u00ab<em>world culture</em>\u00bb unique. Bient\u00f4t, l'Internet accueillera davantage d'utilisateurs non anglophones que d'utilisateurs anglophones.\n\nL'\u00e9dition multilingue de contenus implique: traduction, \u00e9dition, correction d\u2019\u00e9preuves, r\u00e9daction de r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, interpr\u00e9tation, terminologie, technologies linguistiques [traitement de la parole, reconnaissance et synth\u00e8se vocales], etc. L'\u00e9dition multilingue, ce n'est pas simple, cela exige des budgets d\u00e9di\u00e9s \u00e0 ces t\u00e2ches, mais surtout une organisation bien huil\u00e9e, flexible, rapide et efficace.\n\nPuis-je me permettre de souligner que cela n'a rien co\u00fbt\u00e9 en frais de traduction, avec l'exemple de la traduction de la vid\u00e9o de pr\u00e9sentation des Edgeryders. Je ne dis pas qu'il faudrait en faire une norme, et laisser aux populations le fardeau de franchir la barri\u00e8re des langues. Mais plut\u00f4t, je crois qu'il faut regarder la volont\u00e9 des citoyens, qui se cr\u00e9ent des outils pour adapter l'information \u00e0 leur contexte culturel, lorsqu'ils sont plac\u00e9s devant un choix unilingue. Ce choix unilingue ne leur convient pas, alors ils se d\u00e9brouillent pour le changer.\n\nPour pouvoir b\u00e2tir des relations transculturelles gratifiantes, il faut avoir la volont\u00e9 de s'adapter, \u00eatre conscient que des obstacles culturels se posent, \u00e9viter les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes n\u00e9gatifs, et avoir une bonne pr\u00e9paration pr\u00e9alable dans le domaine de la compr\u00e9hension interculturelle.\n\nCeci m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 poser une autre question. L'anglosph\u00e8re en question, se penche-t-elle sur ces questions? Existe-t-il une volont\u00e9 de d\u00e9veloppement strat\u00e9gique multilingue \u00e9manant de l'anglosph\u00e8re? \u00c0 part les efforts admirables d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par John F Moore de Government in the Lab, qui est un pur anglophone am\u00e9ricain - ses efforts sont sinc\u00e8res et authentiques (cela saute aux yeux) -, je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9 que les quelque balbutiements effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 ce jour dans ce domaine r\u00e9pondaient aux v\u00e9ritables besoins des non-anglophones.\n\nOui, il y a l'Open Government Partnership, bas\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Organisation des Nations unies, qui est une organisation s'exprimant en plusieurs langues. Oui, l'OGP poss\u00e8de un site multilingue. Mais c'est bizarre, n'est-ce pas, les principaux pays francophones n'y sont pas. Pourquoi cela?\n\nPar ailleurs, il existe une organisation gouvernementale parapluie qui rassemble les pays ayant le fran\u00e7ais en partage. Si l'Organisation internationale de la Francophonie existe, cela doit r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des besoins... C'est une organisation gouvernementale. Et on parle ici de gouvernance ouverte, et non pas d'un match international de tennis.\n\nLes dirigeants francophones r\u00e9unis au Sommet de Montreux ont indiqu\u00e9 qu'ils voulaient peser davantage dans l'\u00e9chiquier mondial. L'Organisation internationale de la francophonie a <a href=\"http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/bf9a6930-df8c-11df-945d-f8381de1788c/Les_dirigeants_francophones_veulent_peser_davantage\">r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une r\u00e9forme</a> du Conseil de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'ONU. \u00ab<span>Nous d\u00e9cidons de consolider la place et la visibilit\u00e9 de la Francophonie dans la gouvernance mondiale, conscients de sa valeur ajout\u00e9e comme acteur des relations internationales</span>\u00bb, a indiqu\u00e9 un <a href=\"http://www.newspress.fr/Communique_FR_233910_2016.aspx\">communiqu\u00e9</a>.\n\nSi le fait de parler le fran\u00e7ais est une valeur ajout\u00e9e comme acteur dans les relations internationales, cela devrait l'\u00eatre aussi dans la sph\u00e8re de la gouvernance ouverte (mon humble avis).\n\nPar ailleurs, tout un continent - l'Afrique - m\u00e9rite que la sph\u00e8re de la gouvernance ouverte se questionne sur comment faire pour aider ces pays \u00e0 s'int\u00e9grer au mouvement du gouvernement ouvert. Ce n'est pas nouveau, non plus, cette id\u00e9e d'apporter un soutien de d\u00e9veloppement aux pays qui sont plus d\u00e9munis que d'autres. Les Africains repr\u00e9sentent 16\u00a0% de la population mondiale. Environ la moiti\u00e9 de ce continent est francophone. Pouvons-nous laisser de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l'\u00e9quivalent de la moiti\u00e9 d'un continent? Cela fait beaucoup de monde, quand on y pense...\n\nCes questions ne sont pr\u00e9sentement discut\u00e9es NULLE PART.\n\nPouvons-nous amener ces questions \u00e0 l'Open Government Partnership? Euh, nous pourrions essayer. On ne sait jamais... \u00c0 l'OGP, les gouvernements des pays d\u00e9cident toutefois de leur plan d'action, en mode <em>top-down</em>.\n\nJe pense que si nous voulons que la diversit\u00e9 culturelle soit valoris\u00e9e, respect\u00e9e, et renforc\u00e9e dans cette nouvelle sph\u00e8re qu'est la gouvernance ouverte, il faudrait que des non-anglophones pilotent des initiatives, qui permettront de d\u00e9montrer la valeur de la diversit\u00e9 culturelle, \u00e0 celles et ceux qui fonctionnement tr\u00e8s bien d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans l'anglosph\u00e8re.\n\nCarte de pays francophones \u00e0 travers le monde\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Map-Francophone_World.png/450px-Map-Francophone_World.png\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 199px;\">\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-13 04:01:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.381826", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1207, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10689], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19739, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4548, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Grant cycle :-(</b>\n\nIt looks really interesting, but also fairly conservative from the point of view of the economic model, which seems to be based on the grant.\u00a0\n\nThis is in part surprising, because there is a market for photojournalism.

I like how you narrowed a generic problem down to a specific one (integrate the interactive food customs / traditions).\u00a0\n\nIt may be harder than just writing a step-by-step guide to starting a street food activity and translating it into several languages.\u00a0I do not know Germany well, but in Italy the regulatory landscape is a lot tighter than what seems to go for Asian markets (eg Thailand). The moment you start serving food to the public, you need to comply with licensing, safety,\u00a0hygiene regulations. Additionally, many market operate a fixed number of stalls: you cannot just add a food cart as you would in other parts of the world. All of this increases the fixed costs of starting an activity. Every year, as the summer comes and festival season kicks in, the police braces to fight off illegal hawkers (who are, for the most part, just people trying to make a living, many of them migrants). The legal ones are very vocal in demanding that the police shuts down their competitors on fairness grounds (\"we have to comply with all these expensive regulations, whereas these guys just go gray economy\").\u00a0\n\nIn passing: within Europe there are already subastantial regulatory differences. I live in Belgium, and here tiny restaurants with toilets in the basements, that you access through narrow and steep stairs, are very common. In Italy they would all be illegal: restaurants need to have wheelchair-friendly facilities, fire exits whose number and width depend on venue\u00a0capacity, and so on. By my own guesstimate, about half of the restaurants in Brussels would have to shut down if the Italian regulation were ported to Belgium.\u00a0\n\nSo, I guess a first step towards\u00a0<em>A Taste of Home</em>\u00a0is mapping out the regulation, and trying to figure out what the minimum investment needed to start a small food related activity would be.

And it goes back a few years, so I am going to have to skip a few passages here, for sake of brevity.\n\nOne of my first memories of work is someone telling me that you need to have one in order to get a better one. Any job is better than no job. Once in a job, it's all about how you \"sell yourself\" to the next one. What matters to people is that you haven't been idle, that you aren't seen as sitting at home commiserating your unemployed condition, but do something with your time and skills, even if it's voluntary work. So that's how my employment history started, when I was still a high-school student.\u00a0 Some cousins ran a travel agency and I worked there in the summer, doing the usual stuff (photocopies, post office runs, sorting out travel magazines for customers to browse through, etc.). During the winter, I gave support lessons to fellow classmates who needed them. By the time I went to university, I started giving private lessons in music to very young children, and I became a waiter and bartender. By the time I graduated, my CV was (at a stretch) 2 pages long. It was good because I became \"socialised\" with the work world, so different from the educational system that I had just emerged from.\n\nMy first \"real\" job was in the corporate ICT-recruitment sector in London. It was awful. I resisted for 4 months and then ran away. The environment, the corporate pressure, the idea that everyone had to compete with everyone else: it was the opposite of what I wanted. I remember this scene when I resigned and was called in my the scary CEO of the company (which was quite small, so no big deal) who asked me why I was leaving, and I really couldn't face telling her the truth (\"I think you are all crazy!!\") so I played the do-gooder card (\"I have a calling: I want to work in the charity sector\") and this red-haired, powerful woman picked up the phone, dialled the number and passed me the phone receiver: the director of Amnesty International was one of her best friends, and he gave me some advice on how to break into the non-profit world. I always think of this scene as one of the eye-opening moments of my career, but it wasn't. It was just the first of a series of lucky twists and turns that led me - in the good and in the bad - to where I am now. Over time, I have become a fervent believer that \"stuff happens\" just because it does.\n\nBack to my career switch. I was 24 at this point, and wanted to \"make a difference\". I didn't really have a calling, I sort of knew I wanted to work somewhere where people would be nice to each other and shared a common vision which wasn't about making more money, but I had no idea whether I cared more about the blue whale or Somalia's future. I went to a temping agency for the charity sector, and was placed to do admin work inside a large British NGO. It was the most mind-numbing work of my life (recording donations onto a database and printing and sending thank you letters to old ladies in Kent or Scotland), but the people were indeed nice (if a little sleepy) and I made a few good friends. In fact, for someone who had moved to London and was finding it hard to build a proper social life, the office became an important source of friendship and companionship. 12 years on I still have 1 good friend from those days.\n\nBut this is where something started growing inside me. I started asking more questions, started looking at those glamorous people working on the third and fourth floor of the building (the International Department) as they went about doing their world-saving job, returning from missions to war-zones in Central Asia or the forests of Latin America. I started idolising them and their job. Being an aid worker became for me the goal. And once I had a goal, it was all about how I would get there. I started applying for jobs in the International Department, until I got one, and then I stared working my way up the ladder, applying for other jobs, working long hours, proving myself. I did a stint of field work in the Caribbean, and by the time I got back I got a decent senior position in another important NGO, a peacebuilding one.\n\nI remember the interview for this job. I didn't really care much about conflict. All I wanted was to be an aid worker. But unable to find the job I really wanted, I had settled for second best. When they asked me the classic question during the interview \"why do you really want this job?\", I remember lying transparently, making up some story about how part of my family had been killed in the Yugoslav war and I really wanted to make a difference and stop wars around the world. I do, in fact, have Yugoslav blood, and it's true that part of my relatives there might have died during the war, but the truth is we have had no contact with that part of the family since 1939, so for all matters and purpose, it was a lie. And of course I got the job. At the time, my goal was twofold: some financial security and some reputational security. It's tough living in London and telling people - to the questions \"what do you do\" - nothing. You have to have an answer, and finally I had one.\n\nFunnily, this full time permanent job was also the beginning of my \"undoing\" (some would say liberation). The deeper I descended - like Alice - into the employment world and the NGO sector, the more I became disenchanted and sceptical. The more I became good at what I did and looked around me, the more I realised I wasn't' the only one who had lied. In fact, I was probably one of the few who at least had stopped. This isn't about that particular NGO. It's simply that, like at school, I started noticing some people cutting corners, others making stuff up rather than saying \"I don't know\". Some people went as far as blatantly lying: to colleagues, funding agencies, partners. 5 years after my crash-course in corporate bullshit, I found myself in the same exact spot. Only, this time it was the NGO/non-profit sector.\n\nSo I left, and I stared doing consulting gigs. This brought in some cash, a lot of contacts and experience, but little stability and little direction. I am still wondering whether this is the right price to pay for the freedom you have when you have no boss. I still am my boss, because, a couple of years after leaving my NGO job I started a social enterprise - in Italy, my birthplace - and de facto stopped going for interviews and \"looking for jobs\". These days, I tend to juggle my entrepreneurial role with my consulting experience. It's back-breaking, but it's very satisfying. I miss not having a team though, and the social aspects of work that I enjoyed in the past. Becoming an entrepreneur wasn\u2019t a planned decision. It just sort-of happened, like the Amnesty phone call a few years earlier. I would like to say that I had a clear vision when I started, but the truth is: I had no idea what I was doing, like everyone else. My guts told me I was doing something right, but my head was figuring out what to do every day. Because I had never worked on my own until then, I had never really been \u2018my own boss\u2019. And - truth be told - I love it. I love working WITH people, not FOR people. I hate the hierarchies, and power-games, the acting. I love people who get stuff done, and who like to work together. And have fun on the way...\n\nIn conclusion: what do I look for in a job? Today - having gone through the rabbit hole and come out the other way - I look for meaning and purpose. I only want to do things that fit into a bigger scheme, and that make sense for our future. I want to do things that are not morally dubious. I look at the people I will be working with: I do not want to work with people I don\u2019t respect and value. I also look at money, although I will do something really interesting with great people for less money than I would if the job wasn't too interesting and the people not that great. Above all: I look for independence, the freedom to do things like I see fit, the freedom to compare with other people, learn from them, but also chose not to learn. Like Alice through the hole, I have learned that the world on the other side of the work-wall isn\u2019t after all that different from the social world I inhabit.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-09 11:01:07", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 06:12:49.544839", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1610, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 36.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1554, "user_id": 782, "topic_id": 1521, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-13 12:45:24", "updated_at": "2017-09-09 19:00:01.686870", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9105, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2653, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>I think Caroline was interested in this</b>\n\nping <a href=\"/u/caroline\">@Caroline Paulick-Thiel</a>!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-04 08:11:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:52.432998", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14011, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3409, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Too much fun to be had!

I studied physics at university 8 years ago, but dropped out after the first year. The awe for physics and the mythical status of CERN did outlive\u00a0my short-lived career as a physicst.\n\nTogether with @Massimiliano I went to the <a href=\"http://citizensciences.net/biofabbing/\">Biofabbing Convergence</a> (tagline Fabrications &amp; Fabulations) . He was asked to give a presentation about his quest to understand DIYbio and brought me along to co-present some real life observations (and as his 'species' ;-) ). A\u00a0philospher doing a phd on synthetic biology, studying a phenomenon mainly studied by sociologists, Massimiliano is\u00a0a bit out of place in many ways, making his perspective all the more interesting.\n\nThe venue, <a href=\"http://ideasquare.web.cern.ch/\">Ideasquare</a>, is the perfect setting for an event\u00a0that's part\u00a0academic conference, part unconference, part hackathon. I was happy to discover the latter two parts had the upper hand and that everyone that I met had an interesting story to tell as to why they were there.\n\nAfter arriving later than expected (we have much to learn about Swiss buses), we could join the first\u00a0few short plenary sessions. Quickly though, everyone was invited to propose their own sessions or to join the hacking in one of the meeting rooms-turned-hacklabs.\n\nNo time for that in my case, as over the short two days, I went from one interesting conversation to another. To be expected with such a high\u00a0concentration of the most active biohackers in Europe and beyond. Discussing more inclusive education with Bethan from <a href=\"https://www.bento.bio/\">Bento Lab</a> and open source, DIY medicine with Michael from <a href=\"https://fourthievesvinegar.org/\">Four Thieves Vinegar</a>\u00a0among others who are doing amazing things. It is certain: there is much to be learned from each other, and we should encourage this more.\n\nThe <a href=\"/t/call-for-open-science-and-citizen-science-protagonists-how-do-we-build-ourselves-fairer-and-more-inclusive-healthcare/6248\">OpenVillage Festival theme on citizen science</a>\u00a0aims to do exactly that: learn from each other. On day 2 I presented the questions I had raised initially and our ways of tackling them with <a href=\"http://reagentlab.org/\">ReaGent</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ekoli.be/\">Ekoli</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.breakitdown.eu/\">Break it Down</a>. The need to find answers was\u00a0further confirmed by reactions, other presentations and conversations offline and online. Many communities have\u00a0the same issues:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>How to sustain your lab space?</li>\n\n<li>How to sustain people?</li>\n\n<li>How to professionalize in a way that does not compromise values?</li>\n\n<li>How to work with institutions?</li>\n\n<li>How to distribute value in a fair way?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIt was not all seriousness and\u00a0we ended exploring weird ideas like what to do with tonsils after they are removed (<a href=\"http://emutagen.com/index.html\">Adam Zaretsky</a> gave me a detailed protocol after I asked him about how to make\u00a0tonsil burgers; this was not even that far out there compared to the ideas\u00a0he presented the next day) and laughing at the fact that someone is actually getting paid for\u00a0<a href=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--rovqFOTm--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1375900978169133965.jpg\">jamming minced meat in lab glassware</a>.\n\nAs I'm writing this back in Belgium, the discussion is still going on at the event and on the online forum. With so much combined experience and brains, some interesting next steps\u00a0should come out of it. I'm motivated to find solutions by\u00a0sharing our experiences,\u00a0learning from others and connecting dots between\u00a0fields and initiatives. For anyone interested, our joint presentation can be found <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_51GdQ-X3JzSHhySnNpdkZJYWs/view?usp=sharing\">here</a>.\n\nIf these questions resonate with you and your project, <strong>let me know</strong>. I'd like to visit some spaces over the summer to exchange experiences and work on new solutions.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-12 15:38:43", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 04:41:50.626423", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 768, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10104, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3214, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Provisionally assigning to Arthur</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/arthurd\">@ArthurD</a>, are you OK doing this?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-28 13:15:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:58.298068", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5655, "user_id": 3293, "topic_id": 5622, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/37363ba651e7b86d7c05af9f49f6773f72728624.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5aa4b2e13bb42c593aff71aeb6560bdd75b6804d.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"400\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/09a3c283681e03ed89be5abf2f806484140bfb2d.jpg\" width=\"595\" height=\"340\">\n\nI\u2019m Yannick and this is the first time I write for Edgeryders, I went to one of the Brussels Events about failure and I\u2019m really thankful to have gotten access to three days of RE:PUBLICA.

It was like being a child in a Lego store, you want all the sets, but you only can go home with a couple of them.\u00a0\n\n<b>Day 1:</b>\n\nThe City as an open System \u2013 Richard Sennet\n\nAs an amateur urbanist I chose the perfect place to start my marathon. <a href=\"https://re-publica.de/en/16/news/rpten-speaker-richard-sennett-making-thinking-and-vice-versa\">Richard Sennet</a>\u00a0is an Economic and Sociology professor that specialised in urban dynamics but also Internet structures. He opened his talk with an interesting view on smart cities. Smart Cities are in fact cities of control and are mostly used to help high investors do \u2018core investing\u2019. Core investing is a practice in urbanism where an investor build a building wherever it is calculated to be most profitable\u00a0and doesn\u2019t take into consideration the urban environment nor the possible connection of that building with the local sphere.\n\nInstead of investing in the smart city model he proposed to invest in a totally open system. For him this system isn\u2019t one without rules, but one that can be organized through organic synergies. A city is a complex system where ambiguity is more often the solution than newly implemented rules. In that visible we have to create more boundaries then borders. A boundary is an edge that still can be explored; a border is blocked by rules. He then explained how a mall implementation in the 80\u2019s was the example of the boundaries / borders situation. The city of New York wanted to implement a new supermarket inside Spanish Harlem and was hesitating to put it on the boundary between Spanish Harlem and the rich neighbourhoods. But the rich neighbourhoods didn\u2019t want that shop so they pushed it back inside Spanish Harlem. The boundary became a border and the small chance of having interaction between two social classes was but aside to enforce the closed system.\n\nFor Sennet, this simple example of urban\u00a0planning showed how we as a city always want the least conflict-filled solution, even though the conflict could result in an organic and dynamic neighbourhood. We have to open up to the possible changes so new models can occur. To quote Aristotle\u2019s Republica: A city lives from his differences.\n\nDecentralized Energy System\n\nAfter a lecture, time for a workshop. This time, it is about the future of Energy and how each citizen could produce his own. But what module would that future citizen prefer? After a short introduction about how digitalization, decentralization, and Energy management tools are changing the energy market we are asked to find our own solutions. What could we come up with in less than an hour?\n\nThe result: a story about an apartment block where owners and renters are one another's\u00a0suppliers of energy. The owner of an apartment could decide in which clean energy the house could invest and have an internal energy market. But even the tenant with a car could supply energy trough the new tesla technology and bring it back to the grid. Everything monitored by open source Energy Monitoring. Yes, it looked like a dream, but even then it is possible.\u00a0\n\nAutodesk / Makerspace\n\nIn between two talks i decided to go to the Makerspace co-hosted by Autodesk and found an amazing project called<a href=\"http://smart-hydro.de\">\u00a0Smart Hydro</a>\u00a0, a project designed with the Autodesk tools that could provide clean energy to small villages. Not only was the prototype awesome. The idea is to make a hydraulic turbine that can even be put in small rivers and wouldn\u2019t kill any fish is simply terrific.\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"https://re-publica.de/en/16/session/memewars-gif-campaigns-and-gamer-politics\">Memes &amp; Politics</a>\n\nTo end the day a bit more light headed I chose to catch up on the dynamics of memes and their importance to politics. In fact, it was just an excuse to laugh with Putin riding a bear. Surprisingly it got a lot of things right about the importance of internet jokes and politics and how it can way in on the public debate like when <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction\">GamerGate</a>\u00a0happened. This event was one of the biggest one discussing the place of woman in video games. Thanks to sites like Reddit and communities of meme makers the discussion took place.\u00a0\n\n<b>Day 2:</b>\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Seed_Factories/WWF\">Makernet</a>\n\nDay two started really early with a brief talk about the\u00a0Makernet\u00a0concept. Some of you are maybe aware that the fablab and other makers movement is getting to a certain point where they need to scale up to become an important worldwide movement. Makernet is willing to do the framing work for such idea. Bringing all kind of fablabs in contact to each other through a platform where you could easily find any fablab related opportunity but also the skills and knowledge needed to handle the machine. The idea is to design globally and\u00a0produce locally, anywhere in the world.\u00a0\n\nThe most interesting part was the fact they wanted to help developing countries to immediately leap a gap of two hundred years of industrial revolution in a couple of years through shared knowledge, their platform Makepedia and the fablabs. The big question I'm still asking is how can we scale Makerspaces, cause at the moment it stays\u00a0a place to build prototypes.\n\nAutodesk / Makerspace \\#2\n\nI couldn\u2019t help myself and i needed to check some other things out at the makerspace, and to my surprise, there was one of the people behind a really interesting project showing his prototype: a machine you can build yourself to recuperate plastic and make moulds out of it. On paper and on their website it looks <a href=\"http://preciousplastic.com/en\">fantastic</a>, and after testing and analysing the prototype myself i still was convinced by the idea. It\u2019s true the prototype wasn\u2019t ideal, but behind it was a team showing that you can make those machines yourself, hoping other people could improve it with them, bringing the open source thinking to a larger audience. I hope soon I can test their machine to make your own 3D printing material, and so any bad print could be used again.\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"https://re-publica.de/en/16/session/what-behind-new-migrations-massive-loss-habitat\">What is behind the massive migration: a loss of habitat</a>\u00a0\n\nI never heard Saskia Sassen speak before, but after this conference I now see the world differently. In the news, we always talk about two kinds of refugees: the war refugee and the climate refugee. The first one is generally accepted, the second one sometimes but for Ms. Sassen there is a third one that is being forgotten and she calls them habitat refugees: people that lost the place they live for many different reasons that aren\u2019t war nor climate change.\n\nShe explains the principle of Landgrabs: it\u2019s a technique done by big companies to buy land in poor countries, develop plantation with a lot of pesticides and after a couple of years leave the dead land behind. This happens in countries like Qatar or Bosnia, where the local farmers don\u2019t have any power anymore to save the ground they are working on. They stay behind with just the bad ground and have to wait sometimes 10 \u2013 15 years to get back. A lot of those people leave those places searching for better opportunities.\u00a0\n\nAnother example is the way Coca-Cola and Nestl\u00e9 deal with water supplies in India. Because of regulation, they don\u2019t pay more for the water than a private consumer so they use all the water they can and leave behind an empty water pond and ineluctable damages to the local ecosystem and population.\u00a0\n\nAs a third example she explained how China\u2019s extracts in Africa: they build the mine, they build the railroad, they build the harbour. When there is nothing anymore to extrude they just leave everything behind. Again leaving destruction to the people there that don\u2019t have an own habitat.\n\nAll those examples could look like economic\u00a0migration but when she started talking about the kids from South America trying to get north because of the violence and drug/gang problem in South America I understood what she was trying to explain: we need to consider rethinking our etiquettes. Cause all those kids fleeing their city because it just isn\u2019t safe anymore don\u2019t fall under the war or climate etiquette, but still are in danger. That danger has been produced by a worldwide chaos and complex system of effects. Not letting those people pass the border is a crime against humanity. \u00a0Their habitat was destroyed and we aren\u2019t seeing them as refugees.\u00a0\n\nSomething we learned out of the European case: we don\u2019t now at all how to deal with it. We have to listen to WHY they are coming, and we will find a lot of the Habitat migrants and understand the vastly more complex problem that is worldwide migration.\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Makerplatz-240854782633152\">MakerPlatz</a>\n\nRe:Publica doesn\u2019t only happens inside the building, and sometimes you encounter people that are all at Re:Publica for some reason but also have awesome projects outside of it. So in the afternoon of day two i followed Jay Cousins to learn about MakerPlatz and how a dead zone of the Berlin Wall become an integrated makerspace without too much gentrification around. What a trip.\u00a0\n\nEverything started a couple of years ago when the local chief of Planet Modulor wanted to implement a new shop in the neighbourhood. If you don\u2019t know what Planet Modulor is: It\u2019s the place every hobbyist wants to get lost in. But being more than an entrepreneur he wants to involve all the surrounding to the makers movement and finds a couple of guys wanting to start a co-working space. But the people having space are hesitating: do I risk renting my space to young people in the current climate?\n\nThat is when Andreas comes by and gives the man with the space a proposal: rent it out for 1\u20ac /m2 and ask for an open book policy. If they are doing well, you can ask more. And he did well, cause now Betahaus has more than 5000m2 and is an active player in the Makerplatz ecosystem. The third and most impressive project was <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/prinzessinnengarten.kreuzberg\">Prinzessingarten Kreutzberg</a>\u00a0that managed to modify a parking lot into a moveable garden. It\u2019s being in an oasis in the middle of the city. A secret garden on the rocks. The energy that came out of it was simply amazing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aneeta </em><em>Sarkasian</em><em> - photographer unknown,\u00a0<a href=\"http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Nightline/150115_ntl_games_16x9_992.jpg\">sourced from ABC news</a>\u00a0| Smart Hydro - photographer unknown, sourced from <a href=\"http://smart-hydro.de/news-renewable-energy-solutions/\">Smart Hydro website</a>\u00a0| Saskia Sassen - photographer unknown, sourced from <a href=\"http://temi.repubblica.it/micromega-online/le-nuove-patologie-del-capitalismo-predatorio-intervista-a-saskia-sassentitolo-articolo/?refresh_ce\">La Repubblica article</a>.

Les hommes sont toujours aussi d\u00e9sempar\u00e9s.</em>'\n\nDonc il semblerait que l'accumulation de biens, le confort et les distractions n'aient pas fait le poids pour nous aider \u00e0 mieux vivre.\n\nLe progr\u00e8s fait l'objet d'un culte ambigu de nos jours. L'eau est pollu\u00e9e, l'air irrespirable, la nature saccag\u00e9e et les derniers-n\u00e9s maudissent leurs g\u00e9niteurs de leur avoir l\u00e9gu\u00e9 un tel cadeau empoisonn\u00e9. La mobilit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale entra\u00eene la paralysie de tous, la griserie de la vitesse d\u00e9bouche sur la coagulation des flux. Qui n'a pas connu les joies des emboutaillages montres, millions d'heures gaspill\u00e9es?\n\nConcernant le progr\u00e8s, the thrill seems to be gone. Le fr\u00e9missement est-il r\u00e9ellement pass\u00e9? Continuons-nous de tressaillir autant aux moindres nouveaut\u00e9s? De nos jours les d\u00e9sillusions du progr\u00e8s demeurent purement romantiques. Personne ne refuse l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, ou ne cherche \u00e0 revenir \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque qu'on tenait la bribe du cheval...\n\nL'enthousiasme pour l'Internet peut-il constituer une solution? Jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, on n'a jamais vu un outil technique se substituer \u00e0 l'action, renforcer le lien social ou diminuer les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s. Para exemple, l'ordinateur n'a pas eu pour effet de d\u00e9livrer le tiers-monde.\n\nInternet peut-il sortir les pays \u00e9mergents de l'indigence??? Qu'est-ce qui r\u00e9ussirait \u00e0 le faire?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-09 18:55:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:31.122878", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 441, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8689], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14827, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 5501, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>about Monday Call </b>\n\nis it the right place to talk about Consortium things or it's better to focus to \"community\" content?\u00a0\n\nC\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-09 13:24:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:23.550800", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26117, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4836, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Stand by</b>\n\nComputer problem, now solved, <a href=\"/u/markomanka\">@markomanka</a>.
