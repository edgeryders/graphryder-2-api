However, unfortunately, this is not the mindset of the many Irish citizens at the moment. Apart from a select few controversial issues, there seems to be a general sense of apathy towards taking active roles in addressing our societal problems and creating a better future for Ireland. As far as I can see, this is mainly due to a combination of:\n- distractions of modern life\n- inadequate political and sociological education, and a lack of cultivation of critical thought in our school system\n- a feeling of disenfranchisement due to a series of corrupt and/or incapable governments\n- lack of easy-to-use infrastructure for the public to communicate their opinions and desires to government and have those opinions and desires reflected in legislation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile the distractions of modern life may live on, the group I work with \"Grassroots Ireland\" looks to tackle the other three issues.\nWe are a grassroots, community-led movement that aims to empower people to become active citizens through providing simplified education opportunities and resources on useful topics such as politics, sociology, law and economics, so that people can understand and begin to shape the systems that govern their lives.\nThis, along with the promotion of critical thought and positive mental and physical health, we believe, will naturally breed community development and social progress.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne project we are currently working on in this regard is direct/liquid democracy software that will act as a platform for debating, voting and also as a resource for relevant information and simplified summaries of existing and proposed legislation.\nThe plan is to spread the application nationwide in an open-source manner and generate enough interest and demand from the public that the government have no choice but to adopt it, or an improved form, voted on by the public.\nIn our society convenience is often considered to be king. If we make it as easier for people to educate themselves, develop well-informed opinions and give them a means of expressing those opinions, this will lead to increase in confidence, and a desire to participate in the democratic process.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSome other projects we are working on at the moment are:\n- A community hub that will act as a caf\u00e9 and safe physical space to build a community and active citizenry around, for educational talks, wellness classes of all kinds, meetings of community groups and just somewhere to encourage the discussion of important issues\n- A community garden and vegetable growing co-op.\n- A renewable energy co-op\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile it would be great if we could release the direct democracy software and everything would sort itself, we are not banking on it. We realise that people can be skeptical of any kind of change and also reluctant to accept any more responsibility than they already have.\nSo, as a grassroots organisation first and foremost, we hope to use the above social enterprises to provide working alternative models on the ground in our communities to show them that there are better and fairer ways of doing things.\nWe believe that through social enterprises like the ones above, which are scaleable and replicable, we can work with and change the systems that exist from within. \u201cHack the system\u201d, as they say.

Which sounds great, but seriously, what the heck does that even mean?\nMinerva is a new university that aims to reimagine the paradigm of higher education, based on the science of learning. All classes are seminars, with a flipped classroom structure. Meaning that we students, learn the content on our own and spend time engaging with the deeper concepts behind the material. Moving the emphasis away from the professor teaching and instead towards students learning.\nAll of this is facilitated by Minerva\u2019s online platform where all classes take place. Every student (no more than 20 per class) webcams into class, where the platform allows our professors to more easily check how much everyone is participating in the discussion, send us into breakout groups, and live poll the class. Beyond being of instructional benefit, the online format takes away much of the typical costs of facilities development and maintenance that traditional universities place upon their students. Additionally, it allows Minerva to be a genuinely international experience. Our student body is comprised of students from over 40 countries. We live and travel together to seven cities (in as many countries) in cohorts no greater than 150 students. \u00a0\nThis unique structure has brought together an amazing community, with potential for changing many of the ways we view higher education. However, there is one factor of higher education that I work most with, and that is students\u2019 mental health and wellness! Minerva students\u2019 have necessarily high work loads, a variety of cultures and constantly transitioning lifestyles, which makes it the perfect edge case to gain insights on how to improve mental health care in universities.\nAccessibility of Resources:\nIn the U.S., a 2014 study found that the average ratio of university mental health professionals to students is about 1:2080. This means that students in need of counseling services face long wait lists and a low amount sessions, resulting in care that is often literally too little too late.\n\nThis has a simple fix: dedicate resources so that students who seek help can get it! The real challenge comes in getting students to value their own well being and to reach out when they feel they need mental support. 80% of students who commit suicide (the second leading cause of university student death) never come into contact with any staff from the counseling center. How do we address these issues?\nThe answer is Cultivating Care through Community!\nThis is where my work comes in. As a student working on the school\u2019s mental health team I get work on changes that try and address mental health before it becomes an impediment to education. Currently, I am working on a training for students to learn how to better manage their self care and stress management. Additionally, we are adapting trainings from other universities to include aspects from the science of learning, and create a more lasting impact. A prime example of this is the Student Support Network Training (originally developed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute), where students are nominated by their peers to learn how to better understand their own mental health, as well as support friends by caring for them in crisis and connecting to the resource they need.\nIn addition, it\u2019s no longer enough to focus solely on the counseling department\u2019s efforts to improve students wellness. Our academic team offers periodic sessions with deans and professors to help students improve their writing, time management and other skills that can lead to increased stressed when not appropriately addressed.\nThe Student Experience Team has created a series of traditions that brings the student body together as well, to fight the isolation that can commonly occur when students transition into college. Every monday evening a different student takes a leap of faith and give their \u201cMinerva Talk\u201d, by sharing the story of their life so far. On Wednesdays students gather in small groups for Supper Clubs where they all bring some food to share as they explore questions that push them to be vulnerable.\n\u00a0\nWhile we still working on figuring out a lot of how we address student well being (and build this university) it\u2019s become clear that the future of student care must be holistic and not just reactive.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts and also what you are working on!

Making young people relevant, inviting them to our social life, giving them a frame to belong in a European future is the necessary counterbalance for our aging and shrinking population.\nThe rate of cultural change linked to technology has been constantly increasing and initiatives to educate our people must overcome institutional slowing down, if our societies are to participate significantly in the future.\nEducation, learning & the value of teenagers\nTraditional educational systems are failing to take social changes into account. The inertia of national states behind educational institutions is failing to answer to the reality of communities that are experiencing social change at a faster than ever rate. The future we imagine cannot be reached following old pathways.\nTeenagers are left out of social life, with no appropriate spaces or other activities expected from them, apart from attending compulsory school until an age that keeps rising as the human life cycle prospers. In a phase of life characterized by passion and vocation, loads of energy and bluntness, teenagers in Europe find themselves institutionalized and irrelevant.\n\u00abFuture Tools\u00bb project is an acknowledgment of the value teenagers have for society: they hold our future in their hands. \u00abFuture Tools\u00bb is a space designed with caring attention to fit the needs of our young generation, aiming to connect them to a new world of opportunities by inviting them to work, to collaborate, to participate and to have a voice in their own community. We can now apply our knowledge about adolescence to provide a comprehensive environment in which teenagers can develop healthy social emotions, autonomous and egalitarian participation.\nProvide an alternative to corporate uses of technology through the culture of the commons; spread collaborative habits in neighborhoods; build activities rooted in intrinsic motivation that bloom in communal benefit are some of the ways \u00abFuture Tools\u00bb will engage people in fostering a society with greater equality, solidarity and sustainability.\n\u00abFuture Tools\u00bb is a common learning lab for teenagers. By offering youngster a place to gather and pursue their interests while promoting their autonomy, we aim to empower them to work for a better future. Sharing resources and interests in an alternative learning space, the culture of collaboration and the democratizing possibilities of technology, this place will have its roots in the neighborhood\u2019s daily activities and funnel the parents\u2019 interest in social promotion for their kids towards a more inclusive society.\nThe abundance of open resources that can be freely accessed through personal learning environments to learn digital skills \u2014such as computational thinking, governance software, UX design, in fact any skills that we may need to implement our projects in the world\u2014 is an opportunity, never known before to such a widespread extent, to empower our youngsters to build a better future.\nNeighboring environment\nThe neighborhood as a community comes to relevance in the task of \u00abhelping grow adults\u00bb. The age group that most closely matches the Secondary Education stage in our culture has in the neighborhood its spatial range of freedom, just one step away from the wide world they will live in as adults. Connecting these neighboring communities to the global emergence of the digital culture as makers and participants through their own teenagers is a pertinent, strengthening link between local and broader communities.\nIt is urgent for these generations of parents and offspring to leap forward over institutional stagnancy and give ourselves the shared resources we can provide for our own borough, in every neighborhood, nurturing our tribe-prone teens from the gang to the team, by building around them the common ground for community.\nIt is sometimes sad hear stating that what is being promoted for innovation in the field of education \u2014on the basis of empathic personal exchange, attention to the tempo, sensibility for intrinsic motivations, in short: the wisdom of caring for each other\u2014 are outdated methodologies.

There's so many different opinions on what is the best way of educating and each seems to have its merits. In practise there's already quite some alternatives - at least in Belgium - like Steiner and Freinet schools. My experience with those schools is limited and I have not seen miracles. How does\u00a0your philospophy\u00a0relate to the existing alternatives?\nLike @Noemi says, it's a hard case for radical changes. That's not necessarily a bad thing. There needs to be room for experiment, but education is important enough that we should\u00a0prevent major failures, even for a small group. The norm will shift slowly as educators themselves learn. I think it's that learning aspect that makes the difference. I hear the saddest stories while working with children. Usually it's\u00a0educators lacking insight in themselves and their practise, as well as a very static approach to their profession. They are factory workers: follow the protocol, complete the checklist, get good numbers.\nHowever, more and more\u00a0teachers accept change in the form of technological innovation because of this cult-like movement of STEM (Science Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education that is now taking over. I shouldn't complain, I am\u00a0surfing that wave, but STEM has become\u00a0a goal in itself. The A of Art is also too often left out of STEAM. The general idea of technological disruption is already rooted in many people's heads, so it's a small jump for people in the educational system to apply it to their field. Lots of schools in Belgium\u00a0are implementing\u00a0smart boards, apps, school fablabs etc.\u00a0without much thought. Just new shiny tools, which in the end are not optimally used because there is no change in mindset. The teachers, the schools etc.\u00a0rely on technology to avoid changing their behavior. Ironic, because reality is the opposite.\nWe do new biology education and that is\u00a0our trojan horse:\u00a0we can hide a new method in the new technological content that we bring. This also means that these changes to the methods\u00a0won't be too radical.

This, however, does not explain why\u00a0all\u00a0methodologies seem to work so well: Montessori, Steiner, Ecole 42, home schooling... So, here's another possibility: young, smart, charismatic people who care so much about teaching to leave a secure job to invent their own way of doing it are likely to be better than average\u00a0teachers.

It\u2019s about bringing these two aspects, also existing in collaborative economies, communities, in hacker groups and activists promoting open access to knowledge, data and technology to stubborn, hermetic ecosystems of higher education. \n\u00a0\nMy current project, a weblab named Puntozero (http://puntozero.github.io/), explores the ways in which teachers, professors, tutors and students -used to the traditional model of lecturing a class and equipping people with theoretical knowledge and in-field training- might integrate in a community of practice to innovate the way of learning. This year there are about 150 students involved. The brainstorming about proposals include more talking to the patients, who want to collaborate and surely want to see medicine more friendly, more efficient, more human. It is important to change the way we see health care - not as a prestigious, restricted profession for a selected group of professional, but as a practice that has been there for thousands of years, a huge amount of collective wisdom that pioneered and support what we call medicine and care right now. \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s fascinating to play with the idea of a healthcare student classroom where, instead of feeding people with theories, teachers would create space where students meet makers of all sorts and discuss various technological innovations with them, and spend time with their patients, getting hands on experience in various cases. By encouraging sharing of data, more interdisciplinary collaboration, creativity and networking educational institutions could create a new breed of health professionals. Their work style would be more inclusive and horizontal, and they would be more interested in critical thinking and discussion, sharing and transparency. \n\u00a0\nAt the moment I\u2019m working with a couple of small innovations that could lead to improved communication between health professionals and patients. One of them is about involving three trainees in archiving and developing a set of health-related caremojis, accessible in a open, less formal exchange, a tool improving communication and adoption of symbols to represent concepts of concern (e.g.: surgery tools, health conditions, symptoms, etc..). They will be soon ready to be used and evaluated by the students. \n\u00a0\nAnother one is to replace yearly reports from traineeship by an online book, accessible to everyone and encouraging discussion. And it actually did. While i was working as professor I also skipped preparing tests and asked each pupil to come up with one multiple choice question, and out of 150 of them, were chosen random 20 questions set that became the test I made an exam. It was a very democratic, surprising step for students. I tend to be also available online for my students as much as possibile and I put a lot of stress on digital learning and Open Educational Resources (OER) - to save paper, to spare their pockets, to promote more openness, to bring more p2p learning. Finally, I try to skip the usage of huge, expensive books in the classrooms - instead, I look for good, open source materials, and if they\u2019re in English, I ask my students to translate one page each and put it up in Italian as a wiki, available to everyone. There are all these ways in which students are forced to meet and talk, an essential practice, widely absent in the formal education. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019m interested in joining the OPENandchange with the mission of tweaking and/or revolutionizing the classroom and the health care education and training. I want to create more opportunities for students to meet people who change the way care is given in different ways - by making devices, by creating informal institutions, in fablabs and elderly houses. I want to prepare workshops where makers and patients would be working along the health care providers on new solutions. And I want to empower alternative ways of giving care, outside of the formal profession, initiatives driven by values other than money - by the idea of being helpful, virtue of serving each other, and actual engagement. \n\u00a0\nTherefore i would like to engage other scholars, makers, educators, archivists, patients and who else inspired by an open paradigm of healthcare in contributing to a p2p learning project to advance healthcare professions curricula and innovate where possibile and to open knowledge filed the higher education for healthcare professions.

It is considered as a catalyst for a new civilization paradigm of joining forces towards \u201cupgrading humanity\u201d.\nWe used the name \u2018Big Bang\u2019 in a symbolic way to highlight the explosion of new ideas and the creation of brand new knowledge from scratch. A new Big Bang of Creation is about to start at Thessaloniki in the following 2 years (2018) hoping that the idea will expand to other Greek cities and abroad. A school where learning is accomplished experientially, in harmony and interaction with the natural environment, aiming to lead children on a wonderful quest.\nCentral in our philosophy is that educational activities must take place within the natural environment and the whole procedure must be supported through workshops where pupils have the opportunity to discover and connect with new information. Our educational approach encourages the development of capacities through observation, flexibility, adaptability, evaluation, goal setting and self-confidence in order to create their own path of life.\nThe Big Bang Schools are furthering the vision of our initial project, the \u201cSchool of Nature and Colours\u201d. This is an educational role model of creative self-management, in which pupils are taught beyond the curriculum how to learn in-depth, sing, dance, stage theatrical plays, raise funds for their school through a vegetable garden and make their activities and campaigns are known to the public using social media.\nIn this framework, we organize a unique Creative Centre for our children which we called BIG BANG after SCHOOL\u2019. This is a comprehensive program for elementary school children and kindergarten, where all participants are able to connect with music, cinema, dance, theater, arts as well as workshops in creative thinking, constructions, architecture and engineering. Additionally, we created a specific program for elementary courses such as science, history, philosophy and multilingualism. In this project, everyone is welcome to contribute in different ways besides financial support. This is a project designed to benefit children and parents who seek for alternative educational methods of learning and interacting with people and the natural environment.\nMy name is Angelos Patsias, an educator on my 30s who aims to launch various innovative activities that will help create a new educational system that will meet the specific needs of each and every place.

Through our social and educational work, we try to answer a question: how can we live together taking care of our specific differences?\u00a0 Far from the identity concept, we make the most of our similarity, using the new language (Italian) as a common ground. We have opened a first school for refugees and asylum seekers and, some years later, a school for unaccompanied minors. We are now nine (eight women and a man) coming from different backgrounds (Journalism, Pedagogy, Classical Studies, Education, Psychology, Cultural mediation, Languages) and ages (from 25 to 55).\u00a0\nOur schools are the places where we try to build up familiar relationships and a sense of community, but also the place where we try to understand, together, the contradictions of the world we live in. The learning group has here an essential role because it\u2019s the context in which every single student find his place, support and the courage to express himself. The variety of writing and speaking levels we look for in the student group is meant to lead to a free and informal circulation of knowledge and language skills, creating a context where the directory of teaching is also transversal, not only vertical.\nThe language we teach is not only the language of the daily routine, but an intimate language which allows people to reshape and rename their past and present experience, together with their aspirations and future projects. In order to allow everybody to have the opportunity to express himself or herself, we don\u2019t only use the spoken and written language: theatre exercises, songs, handcraft workshops, games, silent books, pictures and images, silk-screen printing, short films are the means through which explore the new language and ourselves.\u00a0\nMontessori\u2019s instruments give an important support to the learning process, as they help reading and writing but also studying grammatical and syntactical structures. We both use original instruments (for example, sandpaper letters, movable alphabet, set analysis and grammar symbols) and readapted tools we calibrated on purpose for the whole group.\nDuring these years we\u2019ve been meeting more than six hundred people coming from all over the world. This exchange of unconscious knowledge constantly creating new ways of schooling and in these years made us organize specific projects based on students real needs or passions:\u00a0\n\nThe discover of the importance - especially for illiterate students - of learning at a slow rhythm, also thanks to practical activities, is the reason why, three years ago, we started to organize \u201cThe ground language\u201d (La lingua della terra), a class around the growing of a vegetable garden and the study of the organic agriculture principles.\u00a0\nThe comprehension of the role of the mother tongue in our life, as the skeleton of our soul, press us to find a way to support and promote all the mother tongues. So, we hold up a group of story-tellers named \u201cRoots and Branches\u201d (Radici e Rami) sharing traditional and fairy tales, poems and myths in the first languages and in Italian.\u00a0\nDue to the need to use as soon as possible the new language also in order to better understand the world where we are living, with its contradictions, injustices and opportunities, we started to explore the city not only as tourists but as researchers: recorder, camera and a set of questions are the equipment with which we walk through the city asking people we meet to share their ideas, their point of view and experience about an issue which is meaningful for all the group.\nThe importance to look at the students as men and women having resources, abilities and strength enhance equal relationships.\u00a0\n\nFrom 2016, Asnada collaborates with the groups Nuovo Armenia and Gina Films. The City of Milano has assigned to us a farmstead (Cascina) situated in the centre of Dergano, a neighbors in the north of the city, in order to build up a place where migration issues could be faced through a cultural production, developed with the foreign communities themselves.\u00a0\nOur goal is to reshape the collective perception of the migration issue with the direct experience of a possibile living together, in order to avoid the usual relationships based on charity or humanitarian help. The \u201cCascina\u201d will be the place where, besides our schools, will be held a multilingual cinema where foreign and Italian people will watch movies in original languages, but also a cafeteria (with controlled prices) and a coworking area.

The story of a social studies teacher who gives an assignment to his junior high school class to think of an idea to change the world for the better, then put it into action. When one young student creates a plan for \"paying forward\" favors, he sets in motion a wave of human kindness which went nation wise. There was one main emotion which did lead these actions but also was produced or given back \u2013 love or/and compassion. Can this happen in real life?\nBoth psychologically and scientifically has been proven that positive emotions affect our health in a very positive way was well. Positive emotions release healthy hormones into our body and not only; the unhealthy release of cortisol and stress related hormones is lower as well. The most important emotions are gratitude, peace, joy, hope, and love. This external boost of positivity also creates neuro-pathways in the brain that are positive. This means that we are able to affect on the biological part of our brain and create a source of positivity which is supported externally as much as internally. Behavioral psychologists retain that even if aggressivity might be considered part of human nature, meaning that it is imprinted in our brain because of our ancestors or as part of human nature, a non aggressive behavior or approach can be taught. What would happen in the world if there would be more love and less aggressiveness?\nThe teacher on the movie says: \u201cIf you could help change the world, would you? What does the world mean to you? How often do you think about things that happen outside of this town? Do you watch the news? We are not global thinkers yet. What does the world expect of us? What if the world is just a big disappointment? Unless, you take the things that you don\u2019t like about this world and flip them upside down. How about, is possible? The realm of possibility, exists where? In each of you. So, you can surprise us. It\u2019s up to you. Or you can sit back and let it be. Make an attempt to interact with the world.\u201d And the kid gave his idea: \u201cPerson A, is me and I help three people in doing something that they cannot do by themselves.\u201d There was one condition, each person who was helped by the kid had to do the same thing with other 3 people, so there would be 9 people helped. And so on, each person with 3 people, and then other 3, and 3 more\u2026 A whole network of people helping one another.\nIn this world is so easy to be skeptic and cynic. It is bad but also the media is playing a big role in reinforcing the bad. Without even being aware we cause and attract negativity to ourselves. We fight, we hate, we break promises, and we disrespect nature, over think of our role as humans in this planet. This movie is one of those that stick with you and I have always wondered if this is something that can be applied in our everyday life. I was talking with a friend and colleague of mine \u2013 we have this new and fresh NGO, with no offices yet and we are trying really hard to get some money at least to cover costs for activities. I talked to her about the movie and the idea, if there is any chance to transform it into a project. The point where we are stuck is that we have not been able to find a way to measure the results and how to report it to the donor. However, what if we could start a campaign, spread the idea out there, and try to do it with no donors in order to not report to anyone. It needs money anyway.\nBut, what if it is possible? What if we can learn and teach how and to love? There is this video on youtube of a young man acting quit aggressively on a tram. You see all the people scared and panicking. All but an old lady, who took his hand on hers and just stayed like that sited near to him. The young man calmed down.

It is built from the ground up to provide individuals and community organizations with an alternative to State- and corporate-run emergency response infrastructures, such as making a 112 or 911 phone call in Europe or the Sates. It offers a flexible and customizable, intake, dispatch, and field support toolkit for coordinating collective action in the event of crises, whether large or small.\nUsing a smartphone or laptop computer, a community member can assemble one or more crisis support Teams, alert their support Team(s) of where they are and what they need by pressing a single button, and communicate in real-time with their support Team. Importantly, Team members can also coordinate with one another, independent of any communication from the person in crisis.\nBuoy is developed by a growing group of anti-capitalist, anti-racist, prison abolitionists calling themselves the Better Angels. We formed in the wake of the Occupy Wall Street protests in the United States, but are more inspired by movements of militant resistance against capitalist and nationalist domination such as the Zapatistas, and Rojavan Kurds abroad, and Black Lives Matter evictions of police occupation domestically.\nMany people are engaged in parallel efforts to both abolish racist systems of social control such as police and simultaneously supplant them with new systems and structures that genuinely serve a community's needs. As technologists, we recognize that technological advancement amplifies all existing power, which is why we focus technical development efforts to support pre-existing activist and community organization processes, rather than imposing new protocols or procedures. This also means we recognize that Buoy is useless for an individual without a pre-existing social support group, whether that be a Church group, family, or activist collective willing to use the tools together.\nFor this reason, Buoy is built so that it can be easily added to an existing community's social service infrastructure. Rather than embarking on creating new services, caregiving groups can add Buoy as a layer atop their existing websites. So Buoy is not a traditional \"app\" that users download in the app store, but rather a means of adding crisis response, emergency dispatch, and coordination tools to the repertoire of any organization already providing caregiving support to their membership.\nInherent in this design is a decentralized architecture that more closely mirrors the way real-life social networks and grassroots organizations are dispersed. On a technological level, it's also a practical return to the earlier days of the Internet before massive, centralized corporate services dominated the landscape of cyberspace. Nevertheless, Buoy makes use of state of the art mobile technology to provide highly accurate GPS-enabled mapping, live video, and other real-time communication tools that in many cases far exceed the meager capabilities of traditional State-run \"First Responder\" services. And we do it using strictly free software that adds no additional burden to a group's budget.\nExperience has demonstrated that there already exist a vast array of functioning alternatives to State-run care giving institutions and crisis response services. Moreover, for the vast majority of issues that people rely on State-run emergency services for, the State's responses do more harm than good. In contrast, community-run services staffed by the friends and peers of people in need provide a quality of care far superior to the level of care provided by similarly-tasked State or corporate employees. This is most obvious in the case of calling 911 in the United States for issues such as \"noise disturbances,\" which too often end in the murder of a marginalized person at the hands of a police officer.\nEnding such horrors requires, in part, providing ubiquitous access to equally-usable alternatives to existing corporate-State partnerships. Much of this alternative infrastructure already exists in certain areas, in the form of community health clinics and volunteer collectives.

Les outils sont l\u00e9gions : Trello pour les fanas de post-it digital en mode collaboration, Slack comme forum organique et le saint graal de la collaboration d\u00e9centralis\u00e9s : Github. Tous ont une arm\u00e9e de fans, mais tous ont le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me : si il n\u2019y a pas une base de valeurs collaboratives sur quoi travailler, ces outils restent un beau d\u00e9cor. C\u2019est comme donner des outils de permaculture \u00e0 un fermier industriel : si il ne voit pas que les valeurs partag\u00e9es sont un atout majeur, il restera avec ces m\u00e9thodes classiques.\nLa Culture de la collaboration\nComme n\u2019importe quelle autre id\u00e9e soci\u00e9tale, elle devient omnipr\u00e9sente quand elle est vue comme une partie de notre \u2018culture\u2019. Mais aucune id\u00e9e n\u2019a fait partie de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 confectionn\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019autre. Un premier pas pour aller vers cette \u2018Culture de la collaboration\u2019 est de voir l\u2019information comme un bateau qui doit arriver \u00e0 bon port. Ca ne sert \u00e0 rien de tenir l\u2019information pour soi, partage la avec la bonne personne, passe les bonnes id\u00e9es comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait un plateau de charcuterie \u00e0 une soir\u00e9e raclette. Chaque personne prendra bien soin de choisir l\u2019info qui lui convient le plus.\nCar une information qui v\u00e9hicule librement aide \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer le deuxi\u00e8me point : Ne perdez plus d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e0 r\u00e9inventer la roue mais essayer de contribuer avec des projets d\u00e9j\u00e0 existant. C\u2019est en ajoutant de nouvelles grilles de lectures, en rentrant dans un projet avec un autre angle ou d\u2019autres informations qu\u2019on apprend beaucoup. Rester dans son enclos n\u2019aide personne, m\u00eame si le r\u00e9flexe protectionniste se comprend : vous voulez contr\u00f4ler votre id\u00e9e contre un opportunisme qui pourrait se cacher derri\u00e8re chaque recoin. Mais si nous acceptions, comme c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 le cas dans les recherches universitaires, d\u2019avoir un syst\u00e8me de mentions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pour la collaboration de projet, nous devrions avoir moins peur de cet opportunisme.\nRecr\u00e9er la membrane de confiance\nCar voil\u00e0, le grand probl\u00e8me qui se cache derri\u00e8re cette peur inn\u00e9cessaire de la protection d\u2019information: on \u00e0 perdu notre membrane de confiance entre humain. Tout dans notre entourage nous dit de se m\u00e9fier de l\u2019autre. Car comme disait ce bon vieux Sartre: L\u2019enfer c\u2019est les autres. Mais si nous relisons la th\u00e9orie du Darwinisme social nous voyons que c\u2019est notre aptitude \u00e0 collaborer qui \u00e0 fait que nous avons surv\u00e9cu aux animaux dix fois plus grand que nous, aux p\u00e9riodes glaciaire et aux famines.\nPour recr\u00e9er cette membrane de confiance nous ne devons pas croire dans \u2018les grand mouvements\u2019, car comme les grandes histoires, elles sont mortes avant d\u2019entrer dans la p\u00e9riode post Moderne. Soyons comme Enspiral, un r\u00e9seaux de petit groupes. Cr\u00e9ons des petits faits, pour r\u00e9apprendre \u00e0 se faire confiance. On ne doit pas d\u00e9crocher la lune, mais simplement savoir aider son voisin. La petite pierre que j\u2019apporte \u00e0 cet \u00e9difice est de prendre le caf\u00e9 chaque matin avec quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre, d\u2019\u00e9couter son histoire et de voir ou je peut faire du lien.\nL\u2019ego doit donner place \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e\nDans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 contemporaine nous donnons encore et toujours trop de place \u00e0 l\u2019ego, qui l\u2019emporte souvent en discussion de l\u2019id\u00e9e. Mais voil\u00e0 si nous voulons vraiment cr\u00e9er une culture de la collaboration nous devons mettre en place des freins \u00e0 l\u2019ego. De pouvoir \u00eatre fier de l\u2019ajout qu\u2019on a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 une id\u00e9e. Ne plus voir la collaboration comme une simple \u00e9conomie du (mauvais) couple, ou chacun donne et qu\u2019on fait les comptes quand \u00e7a ne va pas, mais se focaliser sur l\u2019id\u00e9e et les valeurs v\u00e9hicul\u00e9es en commun.\nPour \u00e7a la collaboration doit se faire par les faits et non par les mots. Trop souvent la r\u00e9union pr\u00e9c\u00e8de la participation, mais c\u2019est en faisant qu\u2019on apprend plus de la personne, que chaque personne est mise \u00e0 nue. Une expression invent\u00e9e par Nicolas de OpenFab trouve ici parfait \u00e9cho: nous devons cr\u00e9er l\u2019atome de FAIRE.\nUn prochain pas pourrait \u00eatre de redonner dans notre \u00e9ducation collective une vraie place \u00e0 la collaboration. Pas de travail- en groupe forc\u00e9 qui mal organis\u00e9 nous prouve que l\u2019enfer c\u2019est vraiment les autres, mais une culture de la collaboration ancr\u00e9 dans le syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9ducation g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nSi vous avez des ressources la-dessus je suis preneur.\nHoward Rheingold | Who Said Collaboration Wasn\u2019t Sustainable\nJason Louv |The Next Buddha Will Be a Collective\nDaniel Christian Wahl | Collaboration and empathy as evolutionary success stories\nEnspiral Stories | 5 Reasons to Build a Network of Small Groups, Rather than a Mass Movement of Individuals", "created_at": "2017-05-22 18:47:11", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 18:47:11", "tag_id": 780, "post_id": 33747, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6596}, {"id": 7202, "text": null, "quote": "I read the enspiral post, it was interesting- \u00a0thanks for sharing!

Les outils sont l\u00e9gions : Trello pour les fanas de post-it digital en mode collaboration, Slack comme forum organique et le saint graal de la collaboration d\u00e9centralis\u00e9s : Github. Tous ont une arm\u00e9e de fans, mais tous ont le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me : si il n\u2019y a pas une base de valeurs collaboratives sur quoi travailler, ces outils restent un beau d\u00e9cor. C\u2019est comme donner des outils de permaculture \u00e0 un fermier industriel : si il ne voit pas que les valeurs partag\u00e9es sont un atout majeur, il restera avec ces m\u00e9thodes classiques.\nLa Culture de la collaboration\nComme n\u2019importe quelle autre id\u00e9e soci\u00e9tale, elle devient omnipr\u00e9sente quand elle est vue comme une partie de notre \u2018culture\u2019. Mais aucune id\u00e9e n\u2019a fait partie de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 confectionn\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019autre. Un premier pas pour aller vers cette \u2018Culture de la collaboration\u2019 est de voir l\u2019information comme un bateau qui doit arriver \u00e0 bon port. Ca ne sert \u00e0 rien de tenir l\u2019information pour soi, partage la avec la bonne personne, passe les bonnes id\u00e9es comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait un plateau de charcuterie \u00e0 une soir\u00e9e raclette.

C\u2019est en ajoutant de nouvelles grilles de lectures, en rentrant dans un projet avec un autre angle ou d\u2019autres informations qu\u2019on apprend beaucoup. Rester dans son enclos n\u2019aide personne, m\u00eame si le r\u00e9flexe protectionniste se comprend : vous voulez contr\u00f4ler votre id\u00e9e contre un opportunisme qui pourrait se cacher derri\u00e8re chaque recoin. Mais si nous acceptions, comme c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 le cas dans les recherches universitaires, d\u2019avoir un syst\u00e8me de mentions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pour la collaboration de projet, nous devrions avoir moins peur de cet opportunisme.\nRecr\u00e9er la membrane de confiance\nCar voil\u00e0, le grand probl\u00e8me qui se cache derri\u00e8re cette peur inn\u00e9cessaire de la protection d\u2019information: on \u00e0 perdu notre membrane de confiance entre humain. Tout dans notre entourage nous dit de se m\u00e9fier de l\u2019autre. Car comme disait ce bon vieux Sartre: L\u2019enfer c\u2019est les autres. Mais si nous relisons la th\u00e9orie du Darwinisme social nous voyons que c\u2019est notre aptitude \u00e0 collaborer qui \u00e0 fait que nous avons surv\u00e9cu aux animaux dix fois plus grand que nous, aux p\u00e9riodes glaciaire et aux famines.\nPour recr\u00e9er cette membrane de confiance nous ne devons pas croire dans \u2018les grand mouvements\u2019, car comme les grandes histoires, elles sont mortes avant d\u2019entrer dans la p\u00e9riode post Moderne. Soyons comme Enspiral, un r\u00e9seaux de petit groupes. Cr\u00e9ons des petits faits, pour r\u00e9apprendre \u00e0 se faire confiance. On ne doit pas d\u00e9crocher la lune, mais simplement savoir aider son voisin. La petite pierre que j\u2019apporte \u00e0 cet \u00e9difice est de prendre le caf\u00e9 chaque matin avec quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre, d\u2019\u00e9couter son histoire et de voir ou je peut faire du lien.\nL\u2019ego doit donner place \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e\nDans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 contemporaine nous donnons encore et toujours trop de place \u00e0 l\u2019ego, qui l\u2019emporte souvent en discussion de l\u2019id\u00e9e. Mais voil\u00e0 si nous voulons vraiment cr\u00e9er une culture de la collaboration nous devons mettre en place des freins \u00e0 l\u2019ego. De pouvoir \u00eatre fier de l\u2019ajout qu\u2019on a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 une id\u00e9e. Ne plus voir la collaboration comme une simple \u00e9conomie du (mauvais) couple, ou chacun donne et qu\u2019on fait les comptes quand \u00e7a ne va pas, mais se focaliser sur l\u2019id\u00e9e et les valeurs v\u00e9hicul\u00e9es en commun.\nPour \u00e7a la collaboration doit se faire par les faits et non par les mots. Trop souvent la r\u00e9union pr\u00e9c\u00e8de la participation, mais c\u2019est en faisant qu\u2019on apprend plus de la personne, que chaque personne est mise \u00e0 nue.

Transforming patients (or their closest carers) into makers is an interesting perspective. We know from citizen science that this first hands involvement often offers a stimulus to personal studies, and reflection about the identity of the problem, and the problem holder. One could argue this is an even more important potential benefit than the access to the devices in itself.\n\nHowever, an important reflection should happen about quality and safety. If one cannot bring a simple solution to the market because of the iters for safety and quality certification, and this we agree is bad, the solution should not be \"ok, let's ignore this step and bypass it\".\nThere are a number of issues here. 1st and foremost, one has to describe how safety and quality are reasonably assured, and what safety net would be put in place should something still happen (although we know they are not perfect, to use an euphemism, today a number of tools and services exist to cover for assistance, accidents' costs, etc on the side of providers).\nOf course, one could ignore this. Depending on the IP scheme, no safety nets would be needed (although it would nice to think of them), for example. But this brings us to a second issue, one that\u00a0is almost\u00a0\"ethical\": transforming every patient in a maker can leverage the citizen-scientist effect only if (this is presented as\u00a0gut feeling here, but I am open to discuss it in depth later)\u00a0the right IP scheme is adopted. And only if radical openness is adopted one can truly claim no responsibility over the final \"accidents\" that will always happen (only that which does not work, will not break).\u00a0Should the creator preserve control of the IP for itself, one will always find a court that will consider the business model \"exploitative\", and enforce the order to establish the aforementioned safety nets (there is an interesting case about a fire happend in an AirBnB apartment that touches on this topic)... falling back to the problem one wanted to work around, just a bit later.\nSo, what would be the general ecosystem' services that would keep this garden grow orderly? I don't see this answered (that's not an easy one,\u00a0indeed)\nResearch, and \"citizen science\", target the pioneers and early adopters... To scale beyond that, we need to think the entire ecosystem, and be humble.\nFor the sake of our understanding, let me be pedant and allow me to stress that\u00a0disabilities do not exist in silos. People have many things going on in their lives, and around them, of course also the disabled ones. They do not stop living when they change status.\u00a0A few will want to pioneer, some will want to have new solutions, some others will not want any because... I am not sure they need a \"because\".\n\nI would like to not dig too deep in the question about why the current \"solutions\" are often not marketed/offered... just for the sake of reasoning together: if you had a clue about how to build an engine, and it would work once every 100 attempts after serious tinkering... would you be able to market it? Let's be honest with ourselves and remember that researchers are very optimistic people (I belong to the category, so this is self-criticism). They will produce proof of concepts, hardly ever demonstrators (although they usually confuse the terminology), and they don't normally ask themselves questions like \"how long will this work continuously?\", \"what will be the safety mechanism once it turns off, as instance because of battery exhaustion?\", how many scenarios are realistically recapitulated in the lab I used for the tests, and how well does this solution generalize?\",...\nLet's not dive in the argument of healthcare provision on this topic. Sometimes it is the right reflection to face, some other it is populistic... In these circumstances it reminds of the sentence I have recently read on twitter \"being poor means having too much end of the month\"... it may steal a smile, but it's a classic example of ill-posedness.

It may not happen. One of the interesting but little understood achievements of the European Union is the gradual and subtle interweaving of Europeans at multiple levels.

Universities and companies around the EU employ a multiplicity of international staff especially from other EU regions.

Ever since we were diagnosed with cancer until the end of our treatment we both were more than convinced our body could fight this and we eventually would win the battle. We were always pretty fanatic with sports and always had a focus on eating healthy. We immediately started to look for information on how to keep our body in the best shape during the chemo and radiation attack. During the first appointments we had at the hospital with a nurse specialized in cancer treatment, we received a lot of information on the treatment itself and its possible side effects. However, there was no information added on (healthy) food, which products to eat best during treatment or information on the possibility to continue exercising.\nAt home our search started at the internet and we looked up questions like: Is it healthy to sport during treatment? What is the best food to eat? Should we be adding supplements to our daily meals? Who can help to keep my body in the best shape?\nThrough the dietician working at the general practitioners office Carry got a first list of products, which could affect the treatment and also some products to prevent loosing too much weight. We did not know if we had to expect a weight loss, because that is what we all think chemo does to your bodies. What we forget is that you get a lot of medicines to fight the treatment side effects, which have again their own side effects, such as potentially gaining weight (take for example prednisone, one tends to store a lot of body liquids that could cause weight increase).\nThe information from the GPs dietician was not sufficient, therefore we asked for the advice of a dietician at the hospital. During the first appointment we asked all kinds of different questions, but we were shocked by the answers. Before we were ill, we ate very healthy, fresh/fair products, now we got the advice of the hospital dietician to buy ready meals in case we would did not feel well enough to cook. Or in case you would lose weight to eat artificially manufactured nutrition containing ingredients to increase weight.\nCurrently there are all kinds of \u2018food fanatics\u2019 and \u2018health hypes\u2019. We are convinced that healthy food should not be a trend. We don\u2019t want to focus on trends or hypes; our focus lies at informing people about healthy food and \u201cback to basic\u201d. We want to reach the target group of cancer patients, to help them in finding good food to fight the battle of their life. As we experienced ourselves, medical specialists at the hospital don\u2019t have enough time to guide a patient in the best way and many dieticians follow the \u2018old\u2019 rules and are promoting the medical food of the pharmaceutics industry.\nWe want to start a foundation, which will have a wide network of researchers, specialized food coaches, sport coaches and doctors to gather information and advice, on how to compose healthy menu\u2019s for cancer patients and provide information on healthy ways of exercising during your illness. Not only in general, but also customized, for each individual. Our plan is to set up an overview listing healthy products to eat during your treatment, but also listing products, that are particularly unhealthy.\nNext to that we want build up a network to reach out to people who cannot cook or are not able to exercise (or just walk) on their own. Look around to your own environment. If you were aware that there is a single man/woman, who lives a couple of streets away, which is not able to cook because he/she is too ill, would you not cook (needless to say that this needs to be in line with the advice of the foundation) for that person? This is called community care.Focusing on the hospital food will be the second target (long-term). Once we start informing patients and start working with researchers, food coaches, sport coaches and doctors, we will eventually be able to slowly change the hospital food.\nFiguring out the healthiest ways to fight your battle by staying in direct contact with your target group is part of specialized care, which would be the future in health care. Not general, but focus on single patients with their own problems/questions and side effects.\nChallenge\n(Customized) advice serving cancer patients during treatment (chemo, radiation,\u2026) to ensure optimal nutrition and exercise.\n\nfocusing on natural instead of artificially produced ingredients\nemphasizing the importance of regular and moderately intensive exercise.\n\nChannels\nShort-term: online (info and community)\nLong-term: face to face (workshops on two main subjects)\nActivities:\n\ndevelop and maintain a blog/website/platform with menu proposals containing healthy ingredients, working together with food coaches and researchers on this. It will be an interactive platform, on which people can also share their own experiences etc.,\ncontact points in the Netherlands on sports coaches to contact for guidance,\nset up sports projects and readings about healthy food and sports for cancer patients,\ncreate communities for healthy cooking, places where people can buy healthy food in case there are not able to cook themselves when they are very ill, or don\u2019t have a partner.\n\nType of community involved\nCommunity consists of cancer patients (no age restrictions or type of cancer)\nSolution proposed; effect on users life?\nEnsure optimal knowledge sharing to enable patients to continue the health-minded lifestyle of before their illness.\n\u00a0\nHow is it open?\nIt is accessible to anybody online (could be perceived as restricting because the community is language specific and starting with the Netherlands!)\n\u00a0\nHow does it \u2018care\u2019?\nThis platform contributes to care by offering a space where patients can share their knowledge and learn from each other concerning the subjects \u201chealthy nutrition\u201d and \u201cexercise\u201d.

I have a rich medical history and although I had a brief run in with acupuncture, I never really went for it. I'd still like try it out\u00a0when the opportunity presents itself.\nIt's an interesting remark on the authority of health practitioners @steelweaver and @Noemi . I think the reliance on\u00a0guidance by an expert\u00a0is in large part\u00a0the result of the patients\u00a0not being as familiar with acupuncture\u00a0as the expert. Yet patients\u00a0are there for a reason: at some level, they believe in\u00a0the positive potential of the treatment. This common\u00a0belief of both parties is the base for authority and\u00a0lends you, or the practitioner, as an expert the authority to give direction. Authority governs the interaction and when nobody (or nothing) assumes it, confusion arises. To be clear:\u00a0authority is different from power.\nI can complement this with my personal experience in the standard healthcare system in Belgium. For a little over 5 years I had a series of serious physical afflictions, which didn't ever seem to heal or resolve themselves and only got worse over the years. At the start I always\u00a0left the clinic with a smile, which\u00a0always disappeared in days, weeks or months as the situation deteriorated again. I experienced first hand that I was just\u00a0a number, and that treating symptoms is faster and\u00a0easier. Good thing for pharma companies, because endlessly treating symptoms sells more drugs.\u00a0Finding the real cause takes longer, is harder and is more expensive, at least in the short term.\nI got pretty skeptical about the system by going from doctor to doctor and spending more time in physiotherapy than with my friends or family. Gradually I lost belief in the system. It was\u00a0after I ultimately found the cause and cure (very simple ones at that) that whatever remained\u00a0of my belief vanished.\u00a0With that\u00a0gone, there was no more common belief between me and the doctor, so the authority vanished. My language can't hide\u00a0it: I found the\u00a0solution, not a doctor or a system.\u00a0For this specific\u00a0illness, I will not lend authority very easily anymore either.\u00a0I'm lucky, as I have a general idea of healthcare through my studies\u00a0and know my body well by now, but this is clearly problematic for the general population when you hear similar stories with unhappy endings.\nAlso interesting that (at least for me) a big part of the authority of the health practitioner is due to belief in the system, rather than a belief in the knowledge of the doctor (which I never really doubted).\u00a0I think that might be a western thing, linked to what\u00a0surfaced in the discussions with @alkasem23 about differences in care with Syria:\u00a0in the west we put our trust in and rely on systems rather than other people. In some\u00a0other cultures,\u00a0people probably put their belief mainly in a person, the doctor.\nEasier interactions through\u00a0the internet,\u00a0powerful search engines,\u00a0a lot of people sharing experience and stories online, easy access to second opinions (in my country anyway)... Though they don't\u00a0always provide\u00a0correct information, these factors also\u00a0lead people to challenge the authority in terms of knowledge\u00a0of the practitioner in the classical doctor's office. I\u00a0think both this challenging of knowledge and the failure of the system will inevitably lead to some fundamental changes in healthcare.\nImportantly, authority cannot simply disappear, the common belief has to shift to something else. Most stories of\u00a0experimentation with new methods in the stories here on Edgeryders\u00a0share some sort of\u00a0community aspect. This\u00a0illustrates a shift to lending authority to a\u00a0collective rather than a system or a person. The\u00a0collective can consist\u00a0of patients, doctors or other caregivers and is likely\u00a0a mixture ideally. In Syria the collective is mainly the family, according to Alkasem.\nLooking through this lens\u00a0of authority\u00a0is interesting and can be applied to many aspects of our\u00a0daily lives.\u00a0The matter is fresh in my head from a Dutch book I just finished reading, which I hope\u00a0gets translated\u00a0to English.

Slowly we realised - by classical 'analysing our own reality' - that the systems and relationships beyond our doors and beyond our direct influence were considerably more effective at creating disease and dysfunction than we could ever be at resolving it - especially on grant funded (frequently cut) project work, creating environments where people could find greater health and humanity.

Thanks for your feedbacks. In 2014, we started with the positive expiratory pressure therapy for CF children. It was in fact not the best move as the exercice takes about 30 minutes daily, which would require a lot of resources to have interesting games, plus the fact that the exercice is quite strict, so challenging to make it interesting. We then thought about other, more free gameplays, which we have to develop. We are now working on mini-games for asthma, that are about triggers and how to take the medicine. We want to reuse the work done for CF to build short games for aerosoltherapy.\nRegarding tests, we did a prestudy with ten children in a hospital, to see their interest, and that was positive. We are preparing two studies with focus groups to test the games that have been improved.\nMany learnings were also about setting the collaboratife framework, platform, etc. We are writing a few articles about that, that should be released in the next month. The initiative mostly advances during events as our community is always small, but we start to have funding and are going to redistribute them, with the aim to mobilize contributors on the long run. One big challenge is also that our non-exclusive model is not easily understood by authorities, so it takes a lot of time to explain it, and many fundings are not available as most competitions support profit-driven organizations.

In one project taking place at the lab, members are engineering yeast to express milk proteins from non-animal sources - next generation of vegan cheeses and milk. Others are busy developing an eco-friendly bacterial sunscreen.\nOpen Insulin is one of these projects, and its goal is to make it simpler and less expensive to make insulin, starting by investigating some novel ideas for making insulin in e. coli using fewer, easier steps than in common industrial protocols. If successful, the members hope it can be a step towards making generic production more economical, and might also enable more participation in research related to insulin, or production of the medicine at smaller scale, closer to the patients who need it, further reducing costs and giving access to more patients who lack it.\nCounter Culture Labs was founded by a group of hackers with diverse backgrounds and interests in the period from 2011 to 2012, with some members coming from Sudo Room, another hackerspace in Oakland that I participated in founding. Many were also involved in Occupy Oakland, and wanted to establish a more permanent organization with the same community spirit and values. Other members came from Biocurious, another biohacking space in Sunnyvale, in the southern end of the Bay Area. I became involved both because I shared the desire to build a community-focused institution, and because I have diabetes type 1 myself, which means I live with the frustration of costly and tedious treatment regimens day in and day out, and I know how much the standard of care for diabetes patients lags behind what recent research suggests might be possible. So, for my own sake, and for the sake of the others with the condition, I sought to take whatever steps I could to close the gap between the research and what is available to patients on the market right now.\nAbout a year ago, some long-standing discussions around making a bioreactor to produce insulin, which had inspired a few previous attempts, turned more concrete when Isaac Yonemoto, another independent researcher of medical treatments, made some suggestions to us about interesting possibilities for innovation and improvement in existing protocols. We started organising regular meetings, and out of those we then organized a successful crowdfunding campaign, which then opened up connections to professionals who work on various aspects of the problem, both the science and engineering around insulin, and the questions of access to medicine. Through this it came to our attention that access to insulin lags far behind the need even now, and even in the most developed countries - costs of insulin are prohibitive even to many people in the US - and all in all, roughly 50% of those in the world who require it have no access to insulin at all, according to the 100 Campaign, a group working on improving access to insulin around the world. There is almost no generic insulin on the American market at the moment - the first one appeared on the market about two weeks after we finished our crowdfunding campaign last year, but it is a long acting type, which is only part of the therapy required by people with diabetes type 1 (about 15-20% of diabetics in USA have type 1; the rest have type 2). And for those who use an insulin pump, short acting insulin is necessary.\nThe general problem in the first world is that the incentives and interests of producers and patient communities are not aligned.\nRight now we\u2019re focused on achieving the first scientific milestones, which is to produce proinsulin, the precursor of the active form of insulin, in e. coli, in our small-scale community lab. Our lab runs mostly on donated and salvaged equipment and reagents and might be comparable in its capabilities to a lab in a less-developed area of the world where there is the least access to insulin. If we succeed, it would show the possibility that small-scale producers in remote areas might be able to make insulin to satisfy local demand, in places where centrally-manufactured supplies can\u2019t reach due to lack of infrastructure - where what roads there are, if any, do not let refrigerated trucks pass to ship needed pharmaceuticals in. Once we have a protocol that embraces everything from production to purification to near the level of purity of pharmaceutical grade insulin, we plan to approach established generics manufacturers with a case for the economic feasibility of serving the unserved market for insulin, and to partner with them to do the rest of the work of achieving sufficient purity of the product and scaling the methods to production. As we proceed with our work, the main batch of patents around the various forms of insulin are expiring, which will further help us make the case for a comprehensive portfolio of treatments to potential generics manufacturers.\nProvided all this goes well, we might then pursue another idea, closer to our original hope of a bioreactor that produces insulin, and a kind of \u2018holy grail\u2019 goal in the DIY bio world, which is a desktop biofactory, an analog of desktop 3D printers, but for proteins and biologics, which we might develop to first execute one of our protocols to produce insulin, but which we might also design with more flexibility in mind. This would consist of a bioreactor portion that could grow a culture of e. coli or yeast, and then extract and purify a product from it - very roughly speaking, the union of a fermenter with an FPLC, a piece of equipment that purifies proteins. If that is possible, supply of insulin could be placed very close to the demand of the diabetics around the world in a simple, economical package, and reliance on distribution infrastructure would be minimized. It would also reduce the need to have skilled technicians with years of lab experience to execute these protocols by hand.\nUltimately, I hope that opening up the tools for research to more people can help to bring research on cures to patients, and not just treatments. Let me mention a few of the more promising ideas that have had some success in research settings. One approach is to implant functioning pancreatic cells from a donor and protect them from immune attack by various means - hard to scale if you need a constant supply of donors,but it might be possible to grow cultures of the cells in vitro to address this. Another approach is to get the immune system to cease its attack on pancreatic cells, and promote the regrowth of the body\u2019s own insulin-producing cells, either in the pancreas, or in another tissue via gene therapy - a simpler approach to apply once it is developed. Some of the ideas use very inexpensive supplies such as adjuvants, the materials in vaccines that provoke an immune response - and there has been some success using adjuvants alone, or with carefully chosen additions, to get the bodies of diabetic patients to reduce or cease their autoimmune attacks. Other concepts address the metabolic changes behind type 2 diabetes. Several drugs between the research and commercial worlds of medicine can act directly on the metabolic control mechanisms of the body, changing its pattern of energy use and other aspects of metabolism back from the pathological state of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes to the normal, healthy base state. Some of them are small organic molecules, easier to make than proteins such as insulin, but due in part to reasons of cost and incumbency, are not mainstream treatments yet.\nAt the most general level, what we seek to prove is that if an order of magnitude more people get involved in research and development of science and technology, medicine can progress much faster, and might no longer be held back by institutional constraints and perverse incentives in the economics of the institutions. Right now, we\u2019re a group about half a dozen people working regularly on the project, with a few dozen more people in touch every now and then to help out, and a hundred or two in the extended community, ready to answer a question or call for help. Every week or two, someone new comes to the group, who just learned about the project via the media or our regular meetups, and wants to help. Some are complete beginners and end up taking our introductory classes to biohacking, some already have experience but got tired of the limits of the institutions where they worked, or have relatives with diabetes and want to contribute to progress. Though we\u2019re building up a broader community of participation in research slowly, we hope our efforts can plant many seeds out of which future innovations will grow.\nMeanwhile, we are looking to broaden a circle of people who can advise us, experienced scientists and engineers who can help us troubleshoot issues that inevitably come up when investigating the unknown, but we also hope to inspire other groups to work independently in a broader community of innovation. We would like to set up a network of both institutional and DIY researchers living all around the world who have different approaches and ways of making insulin as well as tackling other diabetes and health related issues. Beyond producing drugs, participants might research questions of access to medicine, investigate what patient communities need the most, look at academic publications to identify the most promising research that is not making it out to serve patients, or help establish the effort to build the desktop biofactory. Part of our goal is to prove it\u2019s possible and worthwhile for people outside institutions to take the initiative on these questions, and inspire others to take the lead in their own efforts and bring about the broader changes we seek.\nDo you have any projects in health, medicine, or biohacking that you\u2019d like to work on, but lack people, knowledge, or resources to make it happen? Are you working on a diabetes-related solution? Or do you feel like a network of care biohackers is something you\u2019d like to get involved with?

What is the problem/question you are trying to solve/explore?\u00a0Frame it as a design question!\nHow do the differences between family relationships influence the concept of care?\u00a0\nFamily is the space in which we learn to care about other people and in optimal situations are being care for from others. Apart from the abstract idea of a close all-loving family, the reality often looks different and a multiple of imbalances can arise within and across different families. Viewing care as a fundamental good necessary to every human being, different family structures influence the social life of people and create misunderstandings across all the ecosystem. Someone who does not, for whatever reason, have access to care from his \u201cnatural\u201d family, has to seek somewhere else, but meets the difficulty to be part of a society in which different types of care are structure and differentiated, i.e. typically hard emotional situations that need a specific type of care are dealt with the family members. Outside of these close circle, misunderstanding arise as why people should care and how to communicate the need for it.\u00a0\nDifferent family-backgrounds often produce individuals who deal with their emotional life differently. We live in a time where family relationships are being redefined and even though alternative families (single mother, single father, same gender marriages, etc.) are officially being more accepted in the open discourse, the psychological and practical implications are being overlooked. For example, turning your friend or lover into the main care giver\u2014role officially being taken by your parents and/or brother/sisters\u2014still carries social stigmas and difficulties in assessing the fluid role-relationship in play.\u00a0\n2. State the ultimate impact you would like to have. What would make you feel like you did something meaningful with your time?\nRe-think the traditional role of the family as a protection-space and care-giver; deconstruct its traditional proposes and definitions and underpin the imbalances, paradoxes, holes in the system. Center care as an extremely important aspect of our lives, a fundamental good which can have a domino-effect on all other aspects of our lives when not dealt with properly. Create a common linguistic understanding of different family backgrounds and correlate them to the psychological and social implications they carry out. Care is a fluid good and can be shared without the traditional format of a family.\n3. What are some possible solutions to your problems or ways to answer your question? Think broadly. It's fine to start a project/learning process with a hunch or two, but make sure you allow for surprises.\nThe definition of family might be broaden or the caring role and relationship be redefined. At the end, the important aspect is to awaken a conscious thinking about caring and its connection to vital energy, well-being and social possibility with other people. The intimacy by which we hide some aspects of our emotional life must be addressed with the hope a post-traditional exchange system can born out of it.\n4. Write down some of the context and constraints that you are facing. They could be geographic, technological, time-based, or have to do with the population yo're trying to reach.\nInitially the question should be limited geographically and anthropologically to the western world.

One look at the map of the region is enough to understand how difficult for them it would be to access hospitals and doctors otherwise. 2500 islands sit on the Indian part of the river, which starts from the Tibetan mountains and flows through the Assam region, being a home to 3 million people, 10% of the region\u2019s population.\nThere are numerous reasons why providing these places with health care is particularly difficult: due to huge shortages of doctors in India to start with (0.7 per 1000 people), shifting territories of these islands, unstable population and difficult living conditions: they\u2019re connected to the land by boats and suffer from frequent energy and drinking water deficit. Not to mention strikingly high numbers in maternal and infant mortality.\nSanjoy Hazarika pitched the idea of floating clinics to the World Bank in 2000 and received their support - 20,000 dollars to start with. One year later the first boat sailed to bring care to the Assamese, and until today, 14 more followed. The project was eventually joined by the state, which established a public-private partnership with the trust and started funding the offered service. Each month around 20.000 people in total are reached by these facilities.\nSome of the doctors who joined the ships helped to improve their service. One of the keys to success is frequency - by ensuring that each island is visited at least once a month it is possible to take good care of immunization and condition of pregnant women. They also bring the basic medicine, which is cheap in India - but if one needs to hire a boat to get it, the costs soar.\nAnd the service provided by the boat is free - the funds provided by the state amount for 72 400 000 million rupees per year - which, after covering the costs of the boat and the staff, means that there are 480 rupees per person left. Around 5 dollars per year.\nMore about the project here: http://www.c-nes.org/programmes/boat-clinics\nPhoto comes from\u00a0http://www.tehelka.com/2014/07/boat-clinics-provide-healthcare-to-3-million-people-in-assams-river-islands/", "created_at": "2017-01-22 19:26:50", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 19:26:50", "tag_id": 847, "post_id": 708, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 675}, {"id": 7430, "text": null, "quote": "Hey, I now think this post may have slipped attention because it doesn't have \"boat clinics\" in its title!\nThanks for getting the story, Natalia.

A great project by Jonas Rylander which we find very inspiring for our design challenge you can read about in the following post.\nWhat are the expectations about the use of public spaces when it comes to cooking on the street?\nEven tough I already put up a short r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of our research phase here, now follows the detailed version to allow an even better understanding for everyone interested. Also we would like to share the other surprising insights we have gained so far. Maybe they are helpful to one or the other and maybe some of you would like to contribute. What are your thoughts on and what is your interpretation of all this? We would be very thankful for any comments!\nTo first introduce us: We are a group of 4 university students from Berlin, three product designers and one socio economic communication designer and call ourselves \u201cA Taste of Home\u201d. How we came up with the name and the following design question, I will tell below:\n\u201cHow can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?\u201d\nTwo month ago we went into the field asking ourselves \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home and include other people living in this \u201cforeign\u201d country?\u201d Amongst others we ended up talking to one 24 year-old guy from Syria and one girl from Korea about the same age. One had to flee home and the other moved for love.\nBoth of them are living in a caring environment. One in a shared flat with wonderful people (\u201clocals\u201d) who are all very closed to each other and the other together with her boyfriend who originally is from Germany. After having found out about this we dropped the second half of our starting question \u201c[\u2026] and include other people living in this \u201cforeign\u201d country?\u201d , because we did not see this need anymore. They are already sharing their everyday life with \u201clocals\u201d, therefore also cooking with them. At least in this context one could say, they are well integrated. This left us with \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?\u201d\nIn terms of food culture we found out that it is mostly about eating as an occasion. It\u2019s about the taste, but even more about the surrounding atmosphere. The Syrian guy once got invited to the home of a Syrian family also living in Berlin for dinner. The food was \u201cyummy\u201d and \u201cIt tasted, just like it does when my mom cooks.\u201d, but what he enjoyed even more were the conversations, the way things were handled around the table. The two little boys of the family were fighting over the remote control just like he and his siblings used to do back home. There was a lot of fooling around which not just he but everyone enjoyed.\nBoth the Syrian guy and the Korean girl are still cooking dishes they know from back home, even though it never tastes as good as it does when their moms cook. They both said that they left home to early to develop great cooking skills and learn all the tricks. In Korea traditionally a woman would only start cooking by herself after her marriage. Nowadays a lot of young people are leaving the country, respectively their parents\u2019 homes, not being married and therefore without the entire knowledge. But as said before, they are both still trying and sometimes calling their mothers to ask for help. The Korean girl once even tried to sign up for a traditional Korean cooking class to improve her skills but unfortunately it was immediately booked up. Since then she has been hoping for a new opportunity. It seems that missing the food one grew up with is a good motivation to become active. Good food triggers people to do something. It is important to put the emphasis on the word something, because both of the interviewees recognized that it is also the missing time, which keeps them from cooking all the recipes they used to love back home. Some just take too much time in preparation: \u201cMaybe 4 to 5 hours.\u201d, the Syrian guy told us. Having to divide their time between work, German classes, socialising and cooking most of the days they are not willing to spent these many hours on the latter.\nBefore going on and explaining how we reshaped our design question with this knowledge in mind, I would like to share one more surprising insight we gained through the two interviews.\nTalking about food and well being the Syrian guy told us that when he had just arrived to Germany, he did not like to eat outside. It disgusted him. Not being able to see the food preparation made him feel uncomfortable. We tried to find out the reason for this, whether it was because he eats Halal, which he does or it was out of cleanliness concerns, but yet could not manage to do so. We still have to ask again. What happened here shows one of the difficulties we had conducting the interviews. The question triggered some awkwardness. This we felt, but why we were not able to tell. Was it because the subject was sensitive to the respondent and his eating customs? Was it because he did want to offend us since we were talking about German food? How can we overcome such awkwardness whenever it occurs in future interviews?\nTo go on with the process of our research I would first like to recall the reshaped design question: \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?\u201d It still seemed like the question was to broad to be solved in one design project. This is why we changed the target group \u201cpeople on the move\u201d to \u201cyoung migrants\u201d (20-30 years of age). We felt that the latter was more suitable for coming up with a specific design and the people we had interviewed both fit in this category. We then went back to synthesising the interviews once more and found that they were totally worth a second look. There was this whole topic of interactive food customs and traditions we yet had not paid enough attention to.\nReviewing our notes we got to understand, that for the people we had talked to \u201cfeeling at home\u201d in the context of food culture was a lot about the interactive customs and traditions which they had been surrounded by most of their lives. The Syrian guy misses the Syrian nights where as he tells everyone takes their coaches and pillows outside, drinks tea, smokes, chats and just sleeps on the streets. He told us, that this maybe does not happen in bigger towns but in villages as in smaller or medium-sized towns it does.\nThe girl told us that she is missing the Korean street food a lot. Once she tried out a Korean street food market here in Berlin, but did not like it. She went there with some friends. They wanted to have some good Korean food, chat and meet new people. It turned out to be a disappointment. It was too expensive \u2013 there was even an entrance fee \u2013 and the food was just not good. In Korea she always used to eat outside with her friends. Cooking was a family thing; eating out was for all other social events. Considering these stories it made sense to rephrase or specify our question to: \u201cHow can we enable young migrants to integrate interactive food customs / traditions they like and bring from their cultures of origin into Berlin\u2019s community life?\u201d Furthermore it was then that we came up with our group name \u201cA Taste of Home\u201d.\nIt finally was the comment of a fellow student, which led us to modify our topic to what it is about now. She told us about an interview her group conducted with three Syrian refugees. During their conversation the interviewees mentioned the huge summer barbecues they always would have had back in Syria: a lot of friends, family, a lot of food, somewhere in the nature, in a park. Having been asked if they are organising similar activities here in summertime, they denied. They thought that in Berlin it was forbidden to have a barbecue anywhere outside and did not want to act against the law seen their uncertain statuses. Still they miss them. It was this story which made us change the question to: \u201cHow can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?\u201d\nThis question has to be considered on different levels. The higher-level question is: \u201cHow to harmonize the expectations about how to use public spaces?\u201d What do \u201cnewcomers\u201d, what do \u201clocals\u201d, what does everyone using those places want and how can the once being mutually exclusive to each other being handled? The second level is the topic of cooking on the street. Where, how and in which contexts is cooking in public spaces wanted? And last but not least the design challenge is about getting to know the legal frame and making it graspable for everyone.\nAll this is related to the fact, that there are a lot of refugees staying in camps where they do not have any opportunity to cook at all or even if they receive \u201cfood money\u201d instead of catering, they only have access to a shared kitchen. Another guy from Syria we cooked with lives in such a place. He told us, that the huge number of people who are sharing the kitchen there is often keeping him away from cooking. Though some of his friends who are living in another camp without cooking facilities sometimes join him for cooking. How can we enable them to make cooking a regular part of their lives again?", "created_at": "2017-04-15 19:34:39", "updated_at": "2017-04-15 19:34:39", "tag_id": 852, "post_id": 506, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 473}, {"id": 7439, "text": null, "quote": "In the capacity of co-facilitator I am working together with Christabel Buchanan -from the Coventry Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience, on \u2018Real Food Utopias\u2019: an action research project mapping and tracking alternative food systems and economies in and around Thessaloniki.

(For an account of how I came about this decision and my take on the crisis please follow this link here on Edgeryders) During my residence abroad I was working as a business consultant and marketer. After ten years, I decided to return to my Greece to contribute to the local community and help with the bringing about of change. I am currently (amongst others) working on a project called \u201cReal Food Utopia\u201d as a co-facilitator with a foreign research partner, dealing with the mapping of alternative food systems in the region of Thessaloniki. (For a full list of all the projects I'm working on currently and the great and exciting things we are creating in Greece and in EU and links to many of them please look here at another of my posts).\nThe workshops of the project are related to alternative economies, peri-urban gardening, refugees and food through a participatory procedure between people who belong to informal initiatives all around the city. This procedure also includes training in participatory video making and working on all its processes (ie. storyboards, editing) in order to create audiovisual material and share the technique with everyone who is interested in it.\nI am a member of the URGENCI International Network of Community Supported Agriculture, the European Research Group on CSA, and the European Movement for Food Sovereignty. I have been working as an activist on matters related to Food Sovereignty for 5 years and I am currently cooperating with a team of another three more advocates to create a legal entity to represent grassroots initiatives. In the near future, we would like to expand our network through an open call all over Greece and reclaim our existing collaborations and good synergies abroad.\nI am interested in self-sustainability and viable solutions with regards to how we live and thrive and hence I beleive that the future lies in the creation of new types of communities, ecovillages etc, and the promotion of practices like permaculture and the blue economy model of zero emissions that can create self-sufficient farmers and viable, circular economies that not only do not pollute, but actually create more resources instead of depleting them.\u00a0 I am trying to encourage Greek people to be more involved in Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) schemes, to share risks with their farmers during the cultivating season and create a new concept of human relationship within the community they interact with. Additionally, the enhancement of CSA would support small-scale farmers who lack access to the local market and cannot (should not) get involved in complex food chains.\nWe would like to address the needs of small-scale farmers who wish to obtain access to European food markets at fair prices, but also consumers of all ages who become more conscious about food production and consumption. I would like to engage in interactive campaigns and seminars that target informal collectivities who are interested in food sovereignty, but lack financial resources and technical support. Our community project will form a new hub that will host them and their projects.\nWe are interested in creating a new agricultural production model in Greece, focusing on agroecology and self-sufficiency in the context of land and food management, considering limiting factors such as economic hardship. All in all, we pursue the transition to a new way of thinking and living through an \u201cumbrella\u201d project which consists of several innovative schemes.\nThe main scope of the project is to empower rural farmers and inspire rural lifestyle, by combining traditions and technology, based on the principles of permaculture. We wish to enhance small-scale agriculture, in order to revive Greece\u2019s rural areas and promote an economy that is based on social solidarity and alternative currencies.\nWhat we have in mind is summarized in the following fields of action:\n\n\nExporting network of agricultural products in Northern Europe (especially citrus, olive oil and \u201cugly\u201d fruits) that are produced by small-scale farmers to solidarity collectivities at fair prices.\n \n\nPromotion of food security and food sovereignty in Greece.\n \n\nRespond to the mainstream challenges by using our ingenuity and creativity for social \u2013nonpersonal- benefits.\n \n\nReduce food waste promoting \u201cugly\u201d fruits and vegetables focusing on good quality.\n \n\nBoost local economies and offer technical support to Community Supported Agriculture schemes.\n \n\nCreation of an official Greek hub for non formal groups working on food sovereignty that lack financial support.\n \n\nSaving of Greek agricultural land from the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund and ensuring its utilization through concession or purchase by our group in the context of communal ownership.\n \nIncrease awareness and educate farmers and consumers in order to become more conscious through seminars, campaigns and training sessions about sustainable farming methods and consumption patterns.

Ever since we were diagnosed with cancer until the end of our treatment we both were more than convinced our body could fight this and we eventually would win the battle. We were always pretty fanatic with sports and always had a focus on eating healthy. We immediately started to look for information on how to keep our body in the best shape during the chemo and radiation attack. During the first appointments we had at the hospital with a nurse specialized in cancer treatment, we received a lot of information on the treatment itself and its possible side effects. However, there was no information added on (healthy) food, which products to eat best during treatment or information on the possibility to continue exercising.\nAt home our search started at the internet and we looked up questions like: Is it healthy to sport during treatment? What is the best food to eat? Should we be adding supplements to our daily meals? Who can help to keep my body in the best shape?\nThrough the dietician working at the general practitioners office Carry got a first list of products, which could affect the treatment and also some products to prevent loosing too much weight. We did not know if we had to expect a weight loss, because that is what we all think chemo does to your bodies. What we forget is that you get a lot of medicines to fight the treatment side effects, which have again their own side effects, such as potentially gaining weight (take for example prednisone, one tends to store a lot of body liquids that could cause weight increase).\nThe information from the GPs dietician was not sufficient, therefore we asked for the advice of a dietician at the hospital. During the first appointment we asked all kinds of different questions, but we were shocked by the answers. Before we were ill, we ate very healthy, fresh/fair products, now we got the advice of the hospital dietician to buy ready meals in case we would did not feel well enough to cook. Or in case you would lose weight to eat artificially manufactured nutrition containing ingredients to increase weight.\nCurrently there are all kinds of \u2018food fanatics\u2019 and \u2018health hypes\u2019. We are convinced that healthy food should not be a trend. We don\u2019t want to focus on trends or hypes; our focus lies at informing people about healthy food and \u201cback to basic\u201d. We want to reach the target group of cancer patients, to help them in finding good food to fight the battle of their life. As we experienced ourselves, medical specialists at the hospital don\u2019t have enough time to guide a patient in the best way and many dieticians follow the \u2018old\u2019 rules and are promoting the medical food of the pharmaceutics industry.\nWe want to start a foundation, which will have a wide network of researchers, specialized food coaches, sport coaches and doctors to gather information and advice, on how to compose healthy menu\u2019s for cancer patients and provide information on healthy ways of exercising during your illness. Not only in general, but also customized, for each individual. Our plan is to set up an overview listing healthy products to eat during your treatment, but also listing products, that are particularly unhealthy.\nNext to that we want build up a network to reach out to people who cannot cook or are not able to exercise (or just walk) on their own. Look around to your own environment. If you were aware that there is a single man/woman, who lives a couple of streets away, which is not able to cook because he/she is too ill, would you not cook (needless to say that this needs to be in line with the advice of the foundation) for that person? This is called community care.Focusing on the hospital food will be the second target (long-term). Once we start informing patients and start working with researchers, food coaches, sport coaches and doctors, we will eventually be able to slowly change the hospital food.\nFiguring out the healthiest ways to fight your battle by staying in direct contact with your target group is part of specialized care, which would be the future in health care. Not general, but focus on single patients with their own problems/questions and side effects.\nChallenge\n(Customized) advice serving cancer patients during treatment (chemo, radiation,\u2026) to ensure optimal nutrition and exercise.\n\nfocusing on natural instead of artificially produced ingredients\nemphasizing the importance of regular and moderately intensive exercise.\n\nChannels\nShort-term: online (info and community)\nLong-term: face to face (workshops on two main subjects)\nActivities:\n\ndevelop and maintain a blog/website/platform with menu proposals containing healthy ingredients, working together with food coaches and researchers on this. It will be an interactive platform, on which people can also share their own experiences etc.,\ncontact points in the Netherlands on sports coaches to contact for guidance,\nset up sports projects and readings about healthy food and sports for cancer patients,\ncreate communities for healthy cooking, places where people can buy healthy food in case there are not able to cook themselves when they are very ill, or don\u2019t have a partner.\n\nType of community involved\nCommunity consists of cancer patients (no age restrictions or type of cancer)\nSolution proposed; effect on users life?\nEnsure optimal knowledge sharing to enable patients to continue the health-minded lifestyle of before their illness.\n\u00a0\nHow is it open?\nIt is accessible to anybody online (could be perceived as restricting because the community is language specific and starting with the Netherlands!)\n\u00a0\nHow does it \u2018care\u2019?\nThis platform contributes to care by offering a space where patients can share their knowledge and learn from each other concerning the subjects \u201chealthy nutrition\u201d and \u201cexercise\u201d.

Also we would like to share the other surprising insights we have gained so far. Maybe they are helpful to one or the other and maybe some of you would like to contribute. What are your thoughts on and what is your interpretation of all this? We would be very thankful for any comments!\nTo first introduce us: We are a group of 4 university students from Berlin, three product designers and one socio economic communication designer and call ourselves \u201cA Taste of Home\u201d. How we came up with the name and the following design question, I will tell below:\n\u201cHow can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?\u201d\nTwo month ago we went into the field asking ourselves \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home and include other people living in this \u201cforeign\u201d country?\u201d Amongst others we ended up talking to one 24 year-old guy from Syria and one girl from Korea about the same age. One had to flee home and the other moved for love.\nBoth of them are living in a caring environment. One in a shared flat with wonderful people (\u201clocals\u201d) who are all very closed to each other and the other together with her boyfriend who originally is from Germany. After having found out about this we dropped the second half of our starting question \u201c[\u2026] and include other people living in this \u201cforeign\u201d country?\u201d , because we did not see this need anymore. They are already sharing their everyday life with \u201clocals\u201d, therefore also cooking with them. At least in this context one could say, they are well integrated. This left us with \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?\u201d\nIn terms of food culture we found out that it is mostly about eating as an occasion. It\u2019s about the taste, but even more about the surrounding atmosphere. The Syrian guy once got invited to the home of a Syrian family also living in Berlin for dinner. The food was \u201cyummy\u201d and \u201cIt tasted, just like it does when my mom cooks.\u201d, but what he enjoyed even more were the conversations, the way things were handled around the table. The two little boys of the family were fighting over the remote control just like he and his siblings used to do back home. There was a lot of fooling around which not just he but everyone enjoyed.\nBoth the Syrian guy and the Korean girl are still cooking dishes they know from back home, even though it never tastes as good as it does when their moms cook. They both said that they left home to early to develop great cooking skills and learn all the tricks. In Korea traditionally a woman would only start cooking by herself after her marriage. Nowadays a lot of young people are leaving the country, respectively their parents\u2019 homes, not being married and therefore without the entire knowledge. But as said before, they are both still trying and sometimes calling their mothers to ask for help. The Korean girl once even tried to sign up for a traditional Korean cooking class to improve her skills but unfortunately it was immediately booked up. Since then she has been hoping for a new opportunity. It seems that missing the food one grew up with is a good motivation to become active. Good food triggers people to do something. It is important to put the emphasis on the word something, because both of the interviewees recognized that it is also the missing time, which keeps them from cooking all the recipes they used to love back home. Some just take too much time in preparation: \u201cMaybe 4 to 5 hours.\u201d, the Syrian guy told us. Having to divide their time between work, German classes, socialising and cooking most of the days they are not willing to spent these many hours on the latter.\nBefore going on and explaining how we reshaped our design question with this knowledge in mind, I would like to share one more surprising insight we gained through the two interviews.\nTalking about food and well being the Syrian guy told us that when he had just arrived to Germany, he did not like to eat outside. It disgusted him. Not being able to see the food preparation made him feel uncomfortable. We tried to find out the reason for this, whether it was because he eats Halal, which he does or it was out of cleanliness concerns, but yet could not manage to do so. We still have to ask again. What happened here shows one of the difficulties we had conducting the interviews. The question triggered some awkwardness. This we felt, but why we were not able to tell. Was it because the subject was sensitive to the respondent and his eating customs? Was it because he did want to offend us since we were talking about German food? How can we overcome such awkwardness whenever it occurs in future interviews?\nTo go on with the process of our research I would first like to recall the reshaped design question: \u201cHow can food preparation contribute to make people on the move feel at home?\u201d It still seemed like the question was to broad to be solved in one design project. This is why we changed the target group \u201cpeople on the move\u201d to \u201cyoung migrants\u201d (20-30 years of age). We felt that the latter was more suitable for coming up with a specific design and the people we had interviewed both fit in this category. We then went back to synthesising the interviews once more and found that they were totally worth a second look. There was this whole topic of interactive food customs and traditions we yet had not paid enough attention to.\nReviewing our notes we got to understand, that for the people we had talked to \u201cfeeling at home\u201d in the context of food culture was a lot about the interactive customs and traditions which they had been surrounded by most of their lives. The Syrian guy misses the Syrian nights where as he tells everyone takes their coaches and pillows outside, drinks tea, smokes, chats and just sleeps on the streets. He told us, that this maybe does not happen in bigger towns but in villages as in smaller or medium-sized towns it does.\nThe girl told us that she is missing the Korean street food a lot. Once she tried out a Korean street food market here in Berlin, but did not like it. She went there with some friends. They wanted to have some good Korean food, chat and meet new people. It turned out to be a disappointment. It was too expensive \u2013 there was even an entrance fee \u2013 and the food was just not good. In Korea she always used to eat outside with her friends. Cooking was a family thing; eating out was for all other social events. Considering these stories it made sense to rephrase or specify our question to: \u201cHow can we enable young migrants to integrate interactive food customs / traditions they like and bring from their cultures of origin into Berlin\u2019s community life?\u201d Furthermore it was then that we came up with our group name \u201cA Taste of Home\u201d.\nIt finally was the comment of a fellow student, which led us to modify our topic to what it is about now. She told us about an interview her group conducted with three Syrian refugees. During their conversation the interviewees mentioned the huge summer barbecues they always would have had back in Syria: a lot of friends, family, a lot of food, somewhere in the nature, in a park. Having been asked if they are organising similar activities here in summertime, they denied. They thought that in Berlin it was forbidden to have a barbecue anywhere outside and did not want to act against the law seen their uncertain statuses. Still they miss them. It was this story which made us change the question to: \u201cHow can we help newcomers to use public spaces to their full extend because they do not know which activities are legal in these spaces and do not want to act against the law?\u201d\nThis question has to be considered on different levels. The higher-level question is: \u201cHow to harmonize the expectations about how to use public spaces?\u201d What do \u201cnewcomers\u201d, what do \u201clocals\u201d, what does everyone using those places want and how can the once being mutually exclusive to each other being handled? The second level is the topic of cooking on the street. Where, how and in which contexts is cooking in public spaces wanted? And last but not least the design challenge is about getting to know the legal frame and making it graspable for everyone.\nAll this is related to the fact, that there are a lot of refugees staying in camps where they do not have any opportunity to cook at all or even if they receive \u201cfood money\u201d instead of catering, they only have access to a shared kitchen. Another guy from Syria we cooked with lives in such a place. He told us, that the huge number of people who are sharing the kitchen there is often keeping him away from cooking. Though some of his friends who are living in another camp without cooking facilities sometimes join him for cooking. How can we enable them to make cooking a regular part of their lives again?", "created_at": "2017-04-15 19:34:47", "updated_at": "2017-04-15 19:34:47", "tag_id": 853, "post_id": 506, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 473}, {"id": 7465, "text": null, "quote": "users.

(For an account of how I came about this decision and my take on the crisis please follow this link here on Edgeryders) During my residence abroad I was working as a business consultant and marketer. After ten years, I decided to return to my Greece to contribute to the local community and help with the bringing about of change. I am currently (amongst others) working on a project called \u201cReal Food Utopia\u201d as a co-facilitator with a foreign research partner, dealing with the mapping of alternative food systems in the region of Thessaloniki. (For a full list of all the projects I'm working on currently and the great and exciting things we are creating in Greece and in EU and links to many of them please look here at another of my posts).\nThe workshops of the project are related to alternative economies, peri-urban gardening, refugees and food through a participatory procedure between people who belong to informal initiatives all around the city. This procedure also includes training in participatory video making and working on all its processes (ie. storyboards, editing) in order to create audiovisual material and share the technique with everyone who is interested in it.\nI am a member of the URGENCI International Network of Community Supported Agriculture, the European Research Group on CSA, and the European Movement for Food Sovereignty. I have been working as an activist on matters related to Food Sovereignty for 5 years and I am currently cooperating with a team of another three more advocates to create a legal entity to represent grassroots initiatives. In the near future, we would like to expand our network through an open call all over Greece and reclaim our existing collaborations and good synergies abroad.\nI am interested in self-sustainability and viable solutions with regards to how we live and thrive and hence I beleive that the future lies in the creation of new types of communities, ecovillages etc, and the promotion of practices like permaculture and the blue economy model of zero emissions that can create self-sufficient farmers and viable, circular economies that not only do not pollute, but actually create more resources instead of depleting them.\u00a0 I am trying to encourage Greek people to be more involved in Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) schemes, to share risks with their farmers during the cultivating season and create a new concept of human relationship within the community they interact with. Additionally, the enhancement of CSA would support small-scale farmers who lack access to the local market and cannot (should not) get involved in complex food chains.\nWe would like to address the needs of small-scale farmers who wish to obtain access to European food markets at fair prices, but also consumers of all ages who become more conscious about food production and consumption. I would like to engage in interactive campaigns and seminars that target informal collectivities who are interested in food sovereignty, but lack financial resources and technical support. Our community project will form a new hub that will host them and their projects.\nWe are interested in creating a new agricultural production model in Greece, focusing on agroecology and self-sufficiency in the context of land and food management, considering limiting factors such as economic hardship. All in all, we pursue the transition to a new way of thinking and living through an \u201cumbrella\u201d project which consists of several innovative schemes.\nThe main scope of the project is to empower rural farmers and inspire rural lifestyle, by combining traditions and technology, based on the principles of permaculture. We wish to enhance small-scale agriculture, in order to revive Greece\u2019s rural areas and promote an economy that is based on social solidarity and alternative currencies.\nWhat we have in mind is summarized in the following fields of action:\n\n\nExporting network of agricultural products in Northern Europe (especially citrus, olive oil and \u201cugly\u201d fruits) that are produced by small-scale farmers to solidarity collectivities at fair prices.\n \n\nPromotion of food security and food sovereignty in Greece.\n \n\nRespond to the mainstream challenges by using our ingenuity and creativity for social \u2013nonpersonal- benefits.\n \n\nReduce food waste promoting \u201cugly\u201d fruits and vegetables focusing on good quality.\n \n\nBoost local economies and offer technical support to Community Supported Agriculture schemes.\n \n\nCreation of an official Greek hub for non formal groups working on food sovereignty that lack financial support.\n \n\nSaving of Greek agricultural land from the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund and ensuring its utilization through concession or purchase by our group in the context of communal ownership.\n \nIncrease awareness and educate farmers and consumers in order to become more conscious through seminars, campaigns and training sessions about sustainable farming methods and consumption patterns.

This is one of the main reasons why most groups here operate under the radar -which on the other hand is not necessarily a bad thing. But this means that growth comes in relatively slow steps and is hindered by the lack of access to funds and other resources. For example, setting up an NGO costs around \u20ac1000 and has an annual \u20ac1000 \u2018trade tax\u2019 (literally a levy to allow you to do business) -this applies to social enterprises too. And although this is not as bad as having to prepay 100% of next year\u2019s taxation like with most small businesses (or 50% for farmers) it still might pose a problem for people who want to do exactly that: do something without business profit in mind.\nSo in this context, I am happy to announce that we are currently in the process of setting up our grass-roots non-profit organisation to to help us with our endeavours in these fields. What we have in mind is summarized in the following fields of action:\n\n\nAssist in the creation of a movement on food sovereignty in Greece; link existing initiatives with each other and with similar projects abroad; and promote FS in all ways possible.\n \n\nIn collaboration with other European partners (like La Via Campesina and CAWR) set up (a network of) Agroecological Training centres and knowledge exchange hubs.

We need farmers who can stand on their own feet, be self sufficient and knowledgeable to deal with eventualities by using what nature provides.\n \n\nSave Greek agricultural land from the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund and ensure its utilization through concession or purchase by our group in the context of communal ownership. This will be a major undertaking ensuring the right of small agroecological farmers to have access to land and safeguarding the land\u2019s status as a common good.\n \n\nIncrease awareness and offer technical support, training, and tools to create CSA schemes around the country.\n \n\nPromote the creation of Food Policy Councils around the country.\n \n\nBecome the official Greek hub for informal groups working on food sovereignty, enabling them to gain access to financial support, tools and other resources.\n \n\nIncrease awareness and educate farmers and consumers in order to become more conscious through seminars, campaigns and training sessions about sustainable farming methods and consumption patterns and the agroecological way of life. Also offer tools and training in communication and inner development that are crucial factors for the success of any endeavour (eg non violent communication, social permaculture and inner transition).

Do they cry alone in their bedrooms? Do they logon to the internet? How do young people in grief find each other? Do they phone a friend? Do they enter a counselling centre? Do they search through hashtags and websites?\n\nDeath has never been more public than in the age of the internet. Alongside waves of #RIP[insertcelebrity] tributes and #[nameofvictim] police shooting activism proliferating on social media are viral posts of everyday people approaching grief and documenting their experience on the internet: recounting a person\u2019s final days, parting words and gratitude from the deathbed, captures of assisted suicide and \u201cright to die parties\u201d, and families commemorating the deceased.\nThese experiences of death and loss have been augmented and prolonged with the growth of social media use. More specifically, the ways in which a social media platform is structured and the dominant culture of its users has allowed people in grief to process their loss in innovative ways \u2013 new spaces of affect are created, new paralanguage vocabularies are innovated, and new transient networks of care are formulated.\nResearch has emerged in various disciplines focusing on internet memorial pages (in which the deceased and/or their funeral is commemorated on a public page), digital altars and graves (in which the living pay respects to the dead via technological mediations), afterlife digital estate management (in which the transfer and privacy of internet artifacts belonging to the deceased are negotiated), and even RIP trolling (in which trolls hijack Facebook memorial pages with abusive content). There is even an academic journal and a handful of institutes dedicated to \u201cDeath Studies\u201d.\nFor instance, monuments.com enables clients to personalize cemetery headstones with a QR code. By scanning the QR code with a smartphone, users are led to an interactive website where they may upload images and text of well wishes to the deceased and their family, or contribute to building their family heritage through stories or family trees. Users are also able to re-share their post on more mainstream social media.\nAs an anthropologist and ethnographer of digital culture, I have a comprehensive understanding of such practices. But when my younger sister passed away earlier this year, the ways in which her friends expressed and managed their grief in digital spaces led me to discover a rich repertoire of coping mechanisms, exchange of affect, and mutual aftercare in a vernacular created by young people who grew up with the internet - these really moved my heart and encouraged me to examine young people and grief in digital spaces.\nBut\u00a0just what is mutual aftercare? Often after a global grieving event such as large-scale natural disasters or spates of violence, strangers would gather in public spaces that transform into transient sites of solidarity. With candles, flowers, and written tributes in tow, strangers come together to process their grief, share their grief, and lend support to those in grief. Bodies who are not familiar with each other are motivated by the immediate, tangible, and tactile presence of other bodies in an enclosed space to disperse emotions they would usually restraint, and dispense care they would usually withhold when the group\u2019s motivations are briefly aligned. Sociologist Emile Durkheim refers to this as \u201ccollective effervescence\u201d. This is \u2018aftercare\u2019, or the care one offers to others after a hurtful experience. When people come together to publicly acknowledge their pain and simultaneously offer care and concern to fellow others in pain, this becomes a network of \u2018mutual aftercare\u2019. Young people seem to be doing similar things in digital spaces, and I wanted to find out how.\n*\nBeing a young person in my mid-twenties for whom the internet and social media is second nature, I seamlessly took to my blog to make sense of my grief and loss. I wrote about my experiences of \u201cholding space\u201d for my sister in her final days (see also Heather Plett), and about learning to declutter physical artifacts despite my abstract emotional attachment to these things. I also wrote about how I felt when Facebook friends began \u201cdeep-liking\u201d my old posts on grief and how it impeded my progress and recovery. As much as I felt hurt and disappointed by these peers, I could not justify my anger knowing that digital etiquette is not universal \u2013 knowing how to approach someone in grief on social media or how to express grief on social media is not actually \u201ccommon sense\u201d. Digital etiquette varies across personal beliefs and cultural norms, and is highly dependent on the context of interpersonal relationships and the norms of a social media platform. In other words, digital etiquette surrounding grief has to be taught, learnt, and practiced.\nI was both a young person managing grief in digital spaces and an ethnographer invested in understanding everyday practices through intimate anthropological inquiry. To do this, I conducted personal interviews with young people who self-reported using digital media (i.e. the internet, social media, devices and artifacts, non-analogue spaces) to manage their grief. I started with friends in my sister\u2019s social groups, made open calls to undergraduates in local universities, and amassed informants via snowball sampling.\nI wanted to understand what young people did on the internet to recover and how this differed from analogue coping mechanisms pre-social media. I wanted to learn how they constructed solidarity, conveyed empathy, and maintained networks of mutual aftercare. Some also showed me their smartphone apps so that I could study how they crafted content, ranging from emotive Instagram captions of meaningful photographs to extensive digital catalogues of every tactile item the deceased has ever touched.\nI learnt that a vocabulary of grief was quietly emerging among young people. For instance, emoji and emoticons were especially significant as a paralanguage. Some reported that \u201cwhen words fail\u201d, or when they \u201chad no strength\u201d to craft responses back to friends who had sent them condolences, they would mobilize emoji or emoticons to acknowledge receipt, demonstrate reciprocity, or express gratitude. One person who had lost his father to a critical illness said that while \u201cthe adults\u201d in his family did not seem to articulate their grief and loss to each other (\u201cthey strictly never said anything about it in the house\u201d), those in his generation such as his cousins took to Facebook to comfort each other via status updates and follow-up comments. Another young person began a groupchat on the messaging app WhatsApp and recruited friends of the deceased from all walks of life into the chat. They used the groupchat as a semi-private outlet to share their thoughts without having to worry about self-censorship \u2013 many of them felt Facebook was \u201ctoo public\u201d, that email was \u201ctoo impersonal\u201d, and that meeting in person was \u201ctoo soon\u201d, \u201ctoo painful\u201d, or \u201ctoo awkward\u201d. As such, the space of a groupchat accorded them the freedom to process grief more transparently among empathetic others in a safe space; the groupchat became a space of mutual aftercare.\n*\nThe need to understand young people\u2019s grief in digital spaces became clearer to me as I began consulting and conversing with healthcare professionals in palliative care. One hospice nurse expressed that as a patient approaches their end of life, most family members would single-heartedly focus all their effort and affect on that one person. Upon the death of their loved one, many people are suddenly hit with grief all at once and are unable to transit into care for each other, or \u201ccare for the living\u201d. In other words, despite social workers and counsellors preaching the value of \u201ccare chains\u201d, many people who are deep in grief simply do not have the mental capacity and physical resources to plan for self-care or mutual aftercare.\nAnother doctor reported seeing an increasing number of young patients in their late teens or early-to-mid twenties. Sorrowfully recounting a memorable incident in which her young patient instructed her to post a specifically-worded status update on his Facebook after death, she came to realize that young people deeply valued their digital estates as platforms to communicate gratitude and farewells even on their deathbed. In a handful of other instances, young patients requested for their doctors and counsellors to add them on Facebook or to read their blog in order to access sentiment they felt incapable of articulating in person, in physical spaces, via traditional media\nDespite the very crucial work that such palliative staff engage in, much of this work is negotiated ad hoc on-the-go as they \u201cplay by ear\u201d. Most staff do \u201cwhat feels right\u201d based on their individual relationships with their patients, or on their personal concepts of etiquette and ethics. In other words, once we have a better understanding of how young people grief in digital spaces, palliative healthcare workers can be equipped to guide their young patients and clients using their preferred coping mechanisms, devices, and vocabulary. To a generation for whom death and grief are increasingly public spectacles, such care will be crucial to preserving the mental well being of cohorts to come.\n*\nHave you ever commemorated the death of a loved one in digital spaces? What did you do? How did others respond to you?\nWhenever you witness someone sharing their grief on social media, how do you feel? Does it motivate you to respond to the person in particular ways?\nHow can we use social media more conscientiously so as to create spaces for mutual aftercare?\u00a0What can we do for each other in digital spaces whenever a global grieving event occurs?\nWe would love to hear from you.\n*\nThis article was written by Dr Crystal Abidin for OpenCare Research, Edgeryders.

So Nadia came up with a good idea to end the workshop with something concrete. We all felt that one of the biggest issues in care is that we live to much on our own island and that if we want to make care better we need to share and collaborate. But to collaborate we need to create trust. So this exercise was given to every participant and will hopefully end up in solidifying the care network in Belgium.

I\u2019m a keen cyclist for transport and leisure, but my profession is also research in devices enhancing the mobility for people with physical limitations. Therefore I feel an obligation to spread the news about recent advancements in cycling for physically challenged. Have you heard about FES cycling?\nFES - short for functional electrical stimulation - can be used to activate paralyzed muscles by impulses imitating the nervous system in the most natural way possible. We have come a long way with our research and it is possible to use this technique to let people with paralyzed legs cycle again. For some reason there are very few people who know about this so I\u2019d like to share this knowledge with you.\nWe cycle to move, but also to maintain fit. It can be both fun and functional. But, if your legs don't obey you anymore, you will probably not consider it a possibility. Paralyzed legs can result from an accident breaking your back, a stroke or a sneaking disease like the multiple sclerosis. \u00a0\nPeople caring for and curing you need to be very pragmatic, and you with them. Mobility then becomes reduced to passive transport, a dietetic approach to avoiding getting fat and medication of pressure sores and other side effects from lack of physical exercise. That\u2019s where the publicly unknown FES research comes into play. Years of clinical research have consolidated the benefits, but we need to spread the news and understand more about it. Some people may already have heard of handbikes. They allow you to cover greater distances than manual wheelchairs. They are special tricycles where you use the hands for pedaling.\nFES, on the other side, is applied via adhesive electrodes or incorporated in bicycle shorts.

So what was missing is a tool that brought them together.\nI grew up in a rather unconventional setting for people of my generation and later (90s kids like the internet would say) My parents and i shared the house with an elderly woman that wasn\u2019t my grandmother but the godmother of my dad. She was rather cultivated woman with brought knowledge about geography, literature and history. She helped me out on my schoolwork and we shared our interest in reading the news. When she started having difficulties to move out of the house, I helped her staying young by introducing her to the then new technology called DVD and PS2. We played bowling on the Wii and if she would have stayed around longer, I\u2019m sure she would have used my tablet. In opposite to my grandmother who was visiting us every week, my \u2018m\u00e9m\u00e9\u2019 stayed young in her head, and i think it was patly thanks to our dayle exchanges. She would learn me about history and i would learn her about technology.\n\u00a0\nSo when designing my idea i took this story and tried to create the mechanisms that made it work and what was needed to scale up. I found that people where already implementing wii\u2019s in elderly homes to give them exercise. While this is a good idea for them to exercise, the intergenerational part was still missing. So how could we create a game where kids needed to come to the elderly without them having the feeling it was a burden?\nWell you know those games on your phone where you need to do repetitive tasks to go up levels to beat new monsters, like 99% of all mechanics of Role Playing Games? Why not extrude those mechanics of training to the elderly. Give them exercises they can do all day to gain skill points. Arm movements will help the Atk stat for example, Balance will help Def stat and so on. The twist is that the kids playing the game will need to go physically to the elderly to get their little guy leveed up. Want to beat a new boss, but you miss some skillpoint, well go to one of the elderly homes where they play the game and go talk with them. Maybe the first time the discussion will be pure mechanical, but when returning a bound will be created between the people and discussions will be about more then only the game. You have to see it as an incentive to bring people together.\nAfter presenting this project i finished third and got 500 euro\u2019s to spend on material for the project. At that time i was even less into the entrepreneurs world and i failed to continue this project.\u00a0 I still think there are some logics and mechanisms that could be interested to work out.

We need all the strengths and capable\u00a0and smart and successful women, because obviously while men are leding,\u00a0we can not talk about peace and prosperity, we should agree to disagree, to respect and appreciate each to give\u00a0positive example because children learn from their parents, scattered on the model, so change must start from family, parents, environment, kindergartens, schools ... this is serious story , a wide and large, but the success is guaranteed if we work together, jointly, it is not enough to have a law that sanctioned violence, because in every segment of society and at every step of women suffer some form of discrimination, some form of abuse, violence, really suffer if they are young and pretty, and if they are ugly and old, have always been the subject of ridicule, gossip, and never good enough and ther is \u00a0always something wrong , they have to be perfect to be loved because they are \u00a0upbringing in that manner, it is a huge burden, that burden must be rejected, it's okay to be imperfect it's okay to have a bad day, to smilie\u00a0and \u00a0to be good...\nIt is a great theme, and very serious and \u00a0requires indispensable\u00a0large and big steps to make the change, so we\u00a0won't\u00a0any more\u00a0read about dark statistics or to be a part of it,\nI forgot about inadequate or not existing\u00a0 health status of women and treating them, how horrible gynecologist acting,\u00a0a large number of cancers that are not detected at time, shame, \u00a0when they\u00a0give birth listen insults and so on...\n\u00a0I want you to understant situation in my country, importance of the problem and that action is needed, that will not be easy, but it is something that must do\u00a0because it is not a choice any more it is our obligation.", "created_at": "2017-06-26 13:34:42", "updated_at": "2017-06-26 13:34:42", "tag_id": 885, "post_id": 858, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 825}, {"id": 7587, "text": null, "quote": "The special cases of physically disable students who are less in number as we expected that we would also be able to accommodate the wheel chair users along with ramp but at the end they could not make it due to support from their parents and distance, where we found we would have special session along with the guardian and parents also.

The facebook group is just one of the means/tools of the group. As a group, with the resources available for us and the main gaps identified at the national level, we focus on promotional and preventive care. We concentrate in this group, global and local evidence relevant for anyone to prevent cardiovascular diseases. \u00a0 Beyond the key \"theoretical\" principles of WHO, we try to find out, how to raise and to support the motivation of people to change sustainably their dangerous behaviors. There is a need to find the right balance between specificity (focus on the main purpose of the group) and attractivity (diversity of topics and angle of view, pictures, news etc..) in such a way that users have a feeling of distraction while they are exposed to the key messages of prevention of CVD. I perceive that in my context, Facebook is first of all used in for distractive purposes.\u00a0\nThe online facebook group, is not a tool for curative or palliative care such as online consultations with drug prescriptions. Medical doctors are involved in the discussions and if required, they can give offline, specific orientations to go for curative consultations; but discussions in the group, do not involve curative or palliative care.\n2- How do we collaborate? Online, each member has the right to share what matter for him, that is related to the focus of the group. This can be\u00a0a question, a picture, a video, a comment etc... The use of this right of free expression in such a group is not so high everytime of the year. If you scroll down further, you will find periods of high participation \u00a0on some specific subject with high interest and\u00a0later some period of low or no engagement. This depends on several factors, that we are still learning about. I attach to this comment a screenshot that presents a collaborative construction of an answer to a question raised in the group. I can send to you the whole power point if you want.\n3- Dealing with the traps of facebook, how? Facebook is the social media that lot of people use in sub-Saharan\u00a0Africa. The way they use it, seems to be more diversified and intensive than in Europe for instance. Other social media like twitter have a much lower audience in sub-Saharan Africa. So we use Facebook as an important collaborative platform in Coeur d'Or, with the risks that you mentioned including spams. The facilitation team has a critical role to cure the wall of the group. This team has to approve\u00a0all the primary posts, but can not approve comments before their publication. The team has, however, to be vigilant to remove all the inappropriate comments regularly. Private birthday posts are treated as not alway treated as inappropriate. We tolerate them some time for active members as a mean to reward them and to sustain their motivation to collaborate more in the group.\u00a0\n4- Offline events. We realized early in our learning process in the group, that online presence alone is not going to help us reaching our goals. We organize collaboratively offline events: physical activities (walks), risk factors screening, interactive conferences and\u00a0workshops. All those events are organized by members of the group. We use the online tools to recruit members who want to collaborate in the organization. We share with them some key principles and support. We use the online tools as well for advertisement of the events. The access to all the physical\u00a0event is free of charge. We use a collaborative process to raise the funding, using members of the group that has skills and key positions in potential funding structures. By doing so, we were capable of raising up to 25000 dollars in 2015 to organize physical events. This is happening in a context where the ministry of health do not have any internal budget for this kind of event. The local representation of WHO makes about 2000 dollars only available for this kind of event. In the organization of those offline events, community members hold\u00a0a lot of power in the process.", "created_at": "2017-04-15 19:51:24", "updated_at": "2017-04-15 19:51:24", "tag_id": 1625, "post_id": 21489, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 639}, {"id": 7590, "text": null, "quote": "I grew up in a multi-ethnic society, with children from multiple places around the globe.

Collected data can be applied to a various range of fields.\u00a0\nreHub is an interface of interaction man-machine. It can be used in various areas for example the evaluation of dexterity, sport, music & gaming.\nOur beneficiaries are all those people who needs to have an experience feedback concerning the hand movements.\nreHub glove is a tool designed for proprioceptive rehabilitation, to recover movement fluidity after an injury: provided by the physiotherapist, it allows the patient to record and report exercises data such as hand position, finger flexion and fingertips pressure. Recorded data are displayed through a software that reproduces a 3D hand, its movements and detected values. Through the software a physiotherapist is able to evaluate the therapeutic process and possibly change it. Thanks to reHub exercises can be done in physiotherapist presence or at a distance.\nReHub acquires informations about fingers movements from flex and pressure sensors. It uses a 6DOF sensor to define the position of the hand in space.\nreHub glove is the result of a meeting between electronics enthusiasts, a physical therapist and a hand rehabilitation patient to find a way to solve the problem of monitoring the progress during rehabilitation therapy. During this meeting we found out there are no digital devices to monitor the hand rehabilitation and we decided to develop one.\u00a0\nTo define our project we didn\u2019t started from a theoretical concept. We started to make the prototype and to test it.\u00a0\nThe development of reHub working prototype has been at the heart of our design process.\nAs described on www.rehub.pro, the definition of the prototype is subdivided into 4 time frames of research and development. The first steps of the team have moved in electronics and design.\nAfter testing the very first glove we decided to create an integrated system with a self-produced/maker pcb. Our design has always been oriented, and always will be, to integrate all electronics on the top of the glove. Another aspect of our prototype is that the glove itself must be comfortable for the patient. At a later time, once we knew that the glove was able to transmit data to the computer, we focused on the development of a software allowing patients and physiotherapists to evaluate the glove\u2019s collected data through a graphical interface and cartesian charts.\nWe are looking for our final user(s), who will try our product and help us develop different options:\n\nSport\nGaming\nEducational\nMedical \u00a0\n\nWe want to built a community and start a business strategy.\nWe will publish tutorials, kits and software to make your glove.\nEverything to improve the glove solution.\nWe want to develop 4 different kits to sell:\n\nwith single sensors\u00a0\nonly the electronics\nglove tailored\ncomplete of all\n components\n\nWebsites & Social\nwww.rehub.pro\nwww.facebook.com/rehubglove", "created_at": "2017-05-22 19:11:53", "updated_at": "2017-05-22 19:11:53", "tag_id": 902, "post_id": 33751, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6600}, {"id": 7612, "text": null, "quote": ", I found your article extremely interesting.

While there has been an immense growth of international organisation in many areas (NGOs e.g. Greenpeace, TNCs e.g. Vodaphone, GM, Tata), there has been a dearth of overtly international political movements since the collapse of communism. In the context of Tsipras' remarks, we need transnational, pan-european political and social movements. We have the structural underpinnings - in the form of a common language (English dominates the EC) and technologies (social media, etc.). We have the political context in that it has become more and more clear that decisions are no longer made by our national governments for a whole range of issues. We have a clear democratic deficit (the weakness of the European parliament is well known). All this augurs well for a revolution in political action which crosses international boundaries and co-ordinates its activities. There are three movements which have to varying degrees expressed this: the Greens and more recently the Pirate Party and the Occupy Movement. Thus while the time may be ripe for revolutions, wars and other such unpleasantnesses, it may also be a opportunity for political maturity across the board, across social classes and national divides. This may sound somewhat utopian but looking at the realities of today in Europe we could just as easily tip into war (real hard war) as we could into creating trans-national political organisation with specific demands and legislative agendas. Here I suspect we come up against a certain degree of defeatism about the possibility of such political movements. The EC is continuously in danger of tipping into oligarchy (of some form).

All other forms need to be done by the government to be effective. I was really surprised by this ballsy argument so I invited over for a drink on the hottest day of the year (35\u00b0C!) and we had a tomato juice and a great conversation.\n\nWe dived immediately into the subject. Care is a government issue for\u00a0 her that isn\u2019t at all taken care (pun intended) of. Why does the government give as much power to the pharmaceutical industry for example? Why can Nestl\u00e9 become the number one partner of a government organization called \u2018Kind En Gezin\u2019 that helps parents of new-born through the first year? For her our role as activist and change makers is to put pressure on the government to make change on a big scale possible.\nI explain her how local initiatives are bending the system like the open insulin, chemotherapy in Romania or ways that people are hacking neuroprosthetis. Even if she find them great initiative she is scared that it will not be scalable, for her if the government doesn\u2019t follow, nothing will change on the long term. I ask her why even within this idea people are rather trying to find solutions themselves then going in the street and pressuring the government. It makes sense, she says, you have an illusion doing something more meaningful while starting a project, then putting pressure on a government where the reward will (maybe) be given after many years. Instant gratification is much more popular, and with bureaucratic complexification people are less temped to get into a long battle with the government.\nBut Ginette isn\u2019t the person to only be sceptic and give critic towards ideas. She likes finding solutions. So before I explain her the principle of the workshop we talk a bit further on the big problems ahead. For her everything can be put into three categories: poverty, elderly care and work ethics. Poverty makes it impossible to take care of each other; it is a vicious circle that is difficult to get out of. Even with the best projects, people without money will not get towards it. Elderly care is also a big problem in European countries, care became profit and it is all about efficiency. Only a rearrangement about how we look at elderly care can get us out of this problem. Finally there is the way we look at work and how it makes us sick: burn out is one of the biggest epidemics of this century and involves pulls the whole family downwards. Not one political party is discussing these problems on a larger scale and that is problematic for her. The resources are there, but the unwillingness of changing is bigger. Politicians aren\u2019t trained to be vectors of change; they are the ones that bring continuity. It\u2019s the civilians that need to push the change and politics to implement it.\nDark times ahead? Maybe, but this discussion made me think more clearly about the workshop and what we need to take notice of when bringing care-project together. Like within the makers movement it is important to find a balance between corporate and counter culture partners, within care it is also important to have an open approach towards policy makers. Yes we are in a ruff path at the moment, and trust is at an all time low towards politicians. But therefor it is the moment to open our arms to welcome them towards new ways of organizing care. We need much more and easier collaboration between projects. We need especially that knowledge of the government to tackle complex problems with multiple partners. We need to take them by the hand and show them what there is possible within an open care system\nThe discussion I want to open towards the community is: Is involving the policy makers important, or will it be obsolete in the future?

There is a great reason for us to team up and work on the challenge together: Hacking, internet security, and medical devices.

Recorded data are displayed through a software that reproduces a 3D hand, its movements and detected values. Through the software a physiotherapist is able to evaluate the therapeutic process and possibly change it. Thanks to reHub exercises can be done in physiotherapist presence or at a distance.\nReHub acquires informations about fingers movements from flex and pressure sensors. It uses a 6DOF sensor to define the position of the hand in space.\nreHub glove is the result of a meeting between electronics enthusiasts, a physical therapist and a hand rehabilitation patient to find a way to solve the problem of monitoring the progress during rehabilitation therapy.

Our design has always been oriented, and always will be, to integrate all electronics on the top of the glove.

What were your motivations?\nThe Hubotics project started in late 2013. At that point I was about to finish my Master\u2019s studies and I wanted to add a practical side to my technical skills as an engineer and as a passionate DIYer by developing accessible technologies and aids which could have helped improving independence for people suffering from motor disabilities. Actually, the reason why I decided to study engineering and became a builder and hacker stemmed from my personal experience with my sister Chiara, who suffers from a motor disability.\nI remember, as a child, my parents used to buy plenty of super expensive devices, as computer headsets, mice, keyboards or having to travel back and forth between clinics and private medical studios to have access to the \u201clatest\u201d rehabilitation techniques. After having hacked wheelchairs, remote controls for doors and televisions inside our house and having realized several other robotic contraptions, I realized that achievement of independence through the use of one\u2019s own body is one of the most gratifying experiences everyone could hope for, that\u2019s how the idea of creating an exoskeleton to be used in everyday\u2019s life was born.\n2. Did you start alone? How long did it take to develop the initial prototype? How was it funded?\nAround that time, I started speaking about these ideas with Roberto, a friend with whom I had studied between Torino and Milano. Together, we started brainstorming and discussing and we finally converged on the idea of developing a low-cost, 3D printed exoskeleton for rehabilitation and assistance of upper-limbs, directly at people\u2019s homes.\nThe idea was proposed at the Telecom Italia WCAP accelerator in Catania that believed in the project and decided to fund us. This allowed us to buy the 3D printers and the components to build and iterate on our ideas and prototypes. The first reliable prototype of the device, finalized in one year, consisted of a wearable, smartphone-controlled, elbow exoskeleton.\nAfter showing the device at the MakerFaire 2015 in Rome and gathering plenty of positive feedback, we understood that the project had plenty of potential and decided to keep working on it.\nWhat is your current status now?\nToday, together with Roberto and Chiara, we keep on improving our devices and iterate on the designs in order to achieve a concept as usable and useful as possible while maximizing customizability and accessibility. Our latest device consists of an exoskeleton with 3 active degrees of freedom for controlling the shoulder abduction/adduction, shoulder flexion/extension and elbow flexion/extension of its wearer.\nThe device can be controlled by means of a smartphone app or by a program with predefined motions/tasks.\n5. How do you see it moving forward? What kind of help/expertise/data that is missing for moving to a next phase?\nOur main objective in the near future is running experiments with potential users of the exoskeleton and their relatives, in order to gather further feedback and improve our devices based on this.\n\u00a0Additionally, we are brainstorming on possible models that would allow the project to keep its philosophy of openness and accessibility while making it economically sustainable. For example, how to fund the project in order to promote further development? How to enable open/low-cost and customizable solutions capable of reaching end-users? How to ensure that these devices would work (and keep working) at users\u2019 houses (services?), all these are open questions that we will be working on for the next phase.", "created_at": "2017-01-10 17:25:58", "updated_at": "2017-01-10 17:25:58", "tag_id": 924, "post_id": 806, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 773}, {"id": 12212, "text": "", "quote": "modern underground art scene", "created_at": "2017-11-27 22:30:46.465357", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 16:05:38.320834", "tag_id": 2448, "post_id": 35718, "creator_id": 4180, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6985}, {"id": 13154, "text": "", "quote": "On top of diagnosis/prognosis, MCCH supplies free medicines, baby food and nappies.", "created_at": "2018-05-01 09:12:56.612795", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:04.697259", "tag_id": 866, "post_id": 4913, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 4880}, {"id": 7919, "text": null, "quote": "Riversimple was started more than 10 years ago with these and other questions.

The very nice volunteer Berivan showed us around and we had the chance to talk directly with the people.\nThe first time we visited I was surprised how \u201egood\u201c the atmosphere was. I somehow always thought a refugee camp would be a very sad place, but children were running around playing and everyone was kind of open and nice to each other (from my point of view).\u00a0\nThe ICC Messe is a former congress centrum which was recently rebuilt\u00a0to be a refugee camp. The Big Main Hall is segmented with thin white walls into something like 40 rooms that look like roofless boxes. Instead of doors there are blankets and towels covering the entrances. There are no windows; in this main Hall the light comes from tubes in the ceiling.\u00a0Inside of each room there are 4 bunk beds, so in total 8 people per room\u00a0(familys are usually separated and live in private rooms, also: the rooms are separated by gender).\nUsually the rooms don't have any kind of furniture inside, but the one we were sitting in had a big picnic table and a bench and also a bunch of office chairs. We got offered very sweet black Tea in plastic cups and started sharing stories.\u00a0\nFirstly we asked how people organize themselves in the room.\nThe Camp is designed for people to stay around three months, but most of the people are staying six or more. There are only the bare necessities provided. For example there are no possibilities to unpack the backpacks or suitcases, which are probably unpacked since the beginning of the journey. Thats why the people find solutions, for example they pull out nails from the wall and hang their cloth on these nails. Or they found a piece of metal string which they also used to hang cloth from. There are also some card boxes used as bed table and chest. Hussam (who is diligently learning German) pointed at one of the card boxes saying \u201eK\u00fchlschrank\u201c. We were laughing but it was true! tomatoes, cans of beans and a lot of eggs were stored\u00a0there. Also under the bed was a lot of food (maybe the darkest and coldest spot in the room). The reason for that is that they don't always like food by the caterer and of course you get hungry between the official \u201emeals\u201c. They boil the eggs in a water cooker by the way!\u00a0\nAnother interesting observation was a little plastic cup full of washing powder.(they usually give the dirty cloth away to the washing and get them back clean) Hussam told us that he likes his shirts to be without creases and because there is no way to iron,he washes them with his hands and drys them in the room. That was eye opening for me because, yes they might have nothing but they have dignity and preferences! they start a living.\nAlso very interesting is that in the bunk beds the bottom bed is the preferred bed because they can build a little privacy by hanging towels and sheets at the upper bed. The upper bed is always dependent on the main light system which is switched off at 11 in the night.\nBerivan told us that in one room they build constructions out of a broken bunk bed so that also the upper bed could shield from the light.\nAnother very striking construction was a piece of wood sticked to the wall with duct tape which was supposed to be a smartphone shelf, to watch movies at night.\nAlso they put pictures from magazines on the wall to make the atmosphere a little more cosy.\nBut still even if they find the possibility to hack something there is a lot of stuff just flying around in the room.\nThere was a lot of creativity to make the most out of the given, bit still no tools or materials. Berivan told us they used to give out tools, but because they never came back so there are no tools anymore.\u00a0What if we could support the already existing creativity by opening a space for tools and materials? encouraging them with their ideas and hacks?", "created_at": "2017-01-22 22:05:23", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 22:05:23", "tag_id": 924, "post_id": 681, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 648}, {"id": 7752, "text": null, "quote": "ReaGent has been going for about a year.

It would be great to connect these efforts where it makes sense. \n\u00a0\nI\u2019m one of the volunteer organisers of a community of science hackers in Berlin. Since 2013 we\u2019ve been running a local edition of the hackathon Science Hack Day which brings together scientists, artists, designers, engineers, developers and other enthusiasts with an open brief to collaborate, ideate and hack together. We\u2019ve grown a really amazing community of passionate and talented interdisciplinary folks and we\u2019d love to be able to develop some more ambitious civic or cultural projects. But we\u2019re already at the limit of what we can achieve as volunteers. It\u2019s a classic Catch 22 volunteer trap \u2013 we need money to buy us more time, but we don\u2019t have enough time to work on finding money. \n\u00a0\nTHE PROBLEM\nFrom talking to friends in the wider network of DIY and community-based science projects (many related to issues of care) it seems this is a very common problem. From diybio community labs and bioart collectives, to civic environmental monitoring projects, to patient activism groups, to interdisciplinary science hacking communities\u200a\u2014\u200awe all face similar challenges in growing and maintaining ourselves as sustainable civil society initiatives. \nFinding the right balance to sustain a healthy community, share knowledge, and support co-creation is hard. And funding around grassroots citizen science can be particularly challenging, if not unfair: researchers that study us receive more funding than we do ourselves. And, whilst large amounts of public science funding are allocated to \u2018citizen science\u2019 at the both European and National levels, there is very little possibility for non-institutional citizen science communities to access it. \n\u00a0\nJOINING FORCES: THE DIY SCIENCE NETWORK\nThe DIY Science Network has grown out of a number of conversations around these topics. We exploded into existence last autumn fueled by some rather difficult and inequitable interactions with institutional partners, but are now focussed on channeling our energy into positive action. It is a meta network between DIY science initiatives: part \u2018P2P: sharing best practices\u2019 and part \u2018advocacy for access to public research funding\u2019. So far most of the work we\u2019ve done has been about growing the network and finding our identity. \n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nOUR PROGRESS\nWe took part in the Mozilla Global Sprint earlier this month with a focus on the P2P side of the project. However, for now we think the priority should really be to get an advocacy platform up and running as soon as possible in the hope that we might still be able to have some influence on agenda setting for FP9. In the short term we hope soon to secure funding to gather 4-5 European community/project organisers together for a co-design sprint to lay the foundation for the network \u2013 describe our identity, values, mission, begin to craft our advocacy arguments and roadmap next steps \u2013 and build a basic website.\n\u00a0\nAt #Openvillage, we would like to keep our focus on the advocacy side of the project:\n\u00a0\nMAIN CHALLENGE\nHow do we encourage funders to support DIY science initiatives now? And, longer term, how can we foster a funding culture that is supportive of non-institutional science?\n\u00a0\nQUESTIONS TO ADDRESS\n\n\nWhat kind of funding do we need? (fellowships? core funding? project funding?) and how much?\n \n\nThere is a lot of perceived risk in funding non-institutional projects, especially at the European level where so many stakeholders are involved. How to we allay those fears? What about ethics committees, scientific advisory boards, financial controlling...?\n \n\nHow can the impact of our projects be evaluated?\n \n\nDoes it make sense to work with intermediary organisations (fiscal sponsors) who manage the distribution of smaller funds (Individual DIY science initiatives are not usually looking for EC-scale funding budgets - think \u20ac1000s or \u20ac10 000s rather than \u20ac100 000s or \u20acmillions.), provide training/project co-design, mitigating risk for the funding bodies? \n \n\nIs public funding even the way to go? E.g. Would be we better off concentrating on changing the culture of science-funding foundations to encourage them to support DIY science? Should we be working on developing our own business models? ...\n \n\n\u00a0\nAs yet we don\u2019t have a clear idea for a format for #openvillage - it will depend on what stage we are at by the time of the festival. But in general, we are very open to talk about how to bring in this topic in the most constructive way possible for everyone.", "created_at": "2017-06-27 10:19:43", "updated_at": "2017-06-27 10:19:43", "tag_id": 924, "post_id": 6427, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6394}, {"id": 7756, "text": null, "quote": "How do we encourage funders to support DIY science initiatives now?", "created_at": "2017-07-08 14:38:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-08 14:38:48", "tag_id": 924, "post_id": 6459, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6426}, {"id": 7757, "text": null, "quote": "On a lighter note...", "created_at": "2017-05-28 22:57:57", "updated_at": "2017-05-28 22:57:57", "tag_id": 925, "post_id": 13151, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 647}, {"id": 7758, "text": null, "quote": "Jean: There is a desire of using new ways of technology to organize his place within the society je cherche a me socialiser, trouver une occupation profitable, mais je voudrais rester dans la marginalit\u00e9.

The initial goal was to create free software with education and academic programs embedded into it, which would be accessible to remote areas in Latin America for example (I have worked there for many years). \n\u00a0\nThe longer I worked in some of the poorer countries, the better I understood that the pressing need is actually more basic - kids need good nutrition before they can go to school. And the ever present reductionist Model of Disease has to be changed into a holistic System of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. There are various reasons why countries fail at providing the best care possible: too much privatization, too much technology supplanting good, basic policies. Doctors being more drug sellers than anything else. Omnipresent micro-specialization, which pushes medicine even more towards seeing a person as particular organs instead of a whole, complex, bio-psicho-social-spiritual being. \n\u00a0\nAnd so we shifted towards the creation of the System of Health, a system that would integrate care providers, institutions, individuals. A system rooted in the idea of Social and Integrative Medicine, which promotes education, good nutrition, family affection, physical exercise, and sanitary housing conditions, along with the state of the art innovations in the areas of precision medicine, (epi)genetics, bioinformatics, as the best and most sustainable public policies one can make. With this concept in mind, \u00a0GNU Health (any pronunciation is OK, but I like the concept of \"new\") was born in 2008.\n\u00a0\nA little bit later, GNU took its recent shape of The Free Health and Hospital Information System, which is available in a form of wiki - dynamic as the health (care) itself and consistently updated. It can be installed and used by hospitals, governments, institutions, under a free license. As health and care are parts of a complex, multi-etiological and anthropological issues, the system we\u2019ve created allows management and analysis of a huge amount of data and aspects: \n\n\nIndividual and community management: demographics, domiciliary units, families, operational areas and sectors, ...\n \n\nPatient management: Socioeconomics, lifestyle, encounters / evaluations, hospitalizations, lab reports, genetics, clinical history, ...\n \n\nHealth center management: Finances, stock, pharmacy , laboratory, Dx imaging, beds, operating rooms, appointments, supply chain management, human resources, \u2026\n \n\nInformation management: Reporting, Demographics and Epidemiology\n \n\n\u00a0\nAccess to this information and ability to interpret and understand it is a precondition to an effective (health) care system, and it has to complement the work of nurses, teachers, mothers and fathers, social workers and doctors\u2026 Our role is to provide these institutions with a system capable of handling and processing huge amounts of data, and based on these findings - craft optimized prevention and deploy effective teams to tackle challenges. Our maps, for example, can show in real time spots in which the outbreaks of dengue happens, allowing for fast reaction. But it does much more than that - it shows the relations between health and family violence and teenage pregnancy. It underlines social determinants. It grasps the relations between economy and well-being. \n\u00a0\nLater on, we have added more functionalities, for example, Universal Patient\u2019s ID that supports centralisation of information about a person - this way you\u2019re not a new patient to each one of your doctors, but your story is accessible to health professionals.The ID does not allow the duplication of either individuals or patient medical history at the health center. On the upcoming features, the GNU Health Federation, will allow to aggregate information coming from multiple contexts, and \n\u00a0\nGNU Health is, in fact, a philosophy. It is about multidisciplinary communities with various tasks that contribute to more effective, more empathetic, more patient and health-oriented care. It\u2019s about a new mindset and a new attitude of health professionals, whose work cannot be efficient without a human approach to the patients and a deep understanding of their condition. Nutrition, exercise, prevention, information, empathy, affection, family, hygiene, education, technology, housing conditions - these and many more aspects have to be taken care of and supplement each other. \n\u00a0\nThe system is being used in various places. In Argentina and Laos, it has been implemented by neurological and trauma rehabilitation and centers a few years ago. It is being installed in Argentina in districts to manage primary health centers. The Ministry of Health of Morelos, Mexico for the province. The biggest hospital in Laos, a reference in tropical diseases, runs on it as well. The government of Jamaica started a couple of years ago the implementation project for managing the Public Health system of the island.\n\u00a0\nThese institutions and countries are independent now from proprietary solutions, which should be the integral principle in health care. Their work and experience help to improve the community. It\u2019s a lot of solidarity, equity and community work as a result. And they\u2019re free from external vendors, institutions, licenses, they can modify the modules and create new ones - for example, the module dealing with Injury Surveillance System was built in response to the needs in Jamaica. \n\u00a0\nMoney helps us move faster, but it\u2019s the people who make us achieve really remarkable things.

However, we presently have a \u2018scope of work\u2019, and we are in the process of converting it into a comprehensive project plan.\n\nWe are initiateing multilingual communities and living space with people who focus primarily on inner development. Where we are working on our consciousness, because the crisis in our society is a crisis of consciousness. We shift our focus inwards, develop our relationship skills and transform our social programming. There should be as few fixed guidelines as possible concerning the personality and lifestyle of the members except the common to work toward a higher level of development. There are no ideologies, no dogmatic requirements and no fixed concepts.\u201cCAPE\u00a0 aims to build a social net for the members, enacts \"share & care\" principles and provides a framework (legal body) for cooperative economy as well as a space for inter-generational \"new\", action based, co-operative learning.\nCAPE should be a special place for members and learners to revive, a place to flourish, a place for young and old. Sustainable mental health is a result of continuous enthusiasm to our own development and a willingness reconstruct our beliefs.\nWe, the initiators of CAPE LearnLust & Living think that the acceleration of our lives and the deluge of controversy, often absurd and paranoid information from an ailing socio-economic structure leads to the desire of many people for contemplation, inversion and a return to ethical values that are inherent to all human beings, but in \"our experienced world\" increasingly seem to disappear. Sincere joy, love for everything around us, to nature, compassion for each other, time to talk, to feel and enjoy, no longer being so tense and stretched - internally driven, yet not knowing where to go.\nAutonomous and healthy life for the young and the joyful old. To create the miracle called \"we\", which awakens us to renewed life! To unmask the process of maturing as ripening and getting wise. Therefore, we are now tackling this \u2026\nWhat do we perceive? Today our society offers almost unlimited possibilities. This diversity can lead us humans to exhaustion, confusion and disorientation, to sensory overload, burnout! Therefore, every human being is faced with the challenge of finding answers to the following questions:\n\n\n\nWho am I really?\n\n\nWhy am I here?\n\n\nWho or what gives me meaning and footing?\n\n\nWhat is my inherent value?\n\n\nWhere do I want to go?\n\n\nOur goal is to develop as a group to the extent that we understand each other at the height of the developmental stage now possible. These levels of human development are researched and described scientifically. It does not matter at what age we come together, it's fun and is exciting to get to know thyself and develop. As pioneers of a new action based, co-operative learning we share our special talents and skills with those interested. We are convinced that sustainable social change in the global community depends on the quality of personal development, training and the ability to effectively and constructively communicate with others. The focus is on interaction and cooperation, shared responsibility and authority, and the improvement of critical thinking. There is no 'teacher' in the traditional sense. Learning will be self-organizing, dynamically adjusted to needs and ideas of the \"learners\".\n\n              \n  \n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentautonomy\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2017-11-30 00:57:02.126327", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:47.814587", "tag_id": 1509, "post_id": 765, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 732}, {"id": 7793, "text": null, "quote": "My name is Ivan Ezeigbo. I am 20 years old, and currently a sophomore at Minerva Schools at KGI, California, USA. I was inspired by Monica Marcu\u2019s book, The Miracle Tree, to research with a team back in Nigeria on the blood regulatory power of the contents of the leaves of a very medicinal plant. It is a herbal plant that has just drawn a lot of attention in its potential to cure over three hundred ailments. This is the Moringa Oleifera. We experimented on Wistar albino rats. The idea was to inject alloxan intraperitoneally to all groups of Wistar albino rats with healthy working pancreas (alloxan increases blood sugar level, thus inducing hyperglycaemia or making them \u201cpseudo-diabetic\u201d). The bioactive agents of moringa leaves were extracted with ethanol and water, and two groups of the rats were treated each with these contents. An additional group was treated with synthetic insulin (insulin is a natural blood regulatory hormone that brings down blood sugar level), and all three groups were observed. We discovered that the group of Wistar albino rats treated with the bioactive agents of the moringa leaves extracted with water had a SIGNIFICANTLY SIMILAR blood sugar level as those treated with synthetic insulin, and less significant with those treated with ethanol. This unearthened two truths. First, moringa has powerful blood regulatory effects, almost equivalent to the natural insulin. Secondly, water is a better extraction agent than ethanol, unlike the case for many other plant leaves. Aside its blood regulatory power, moringa also cures diarrhea, and many other bacterial and fungal infections. It is also a healthy store for numerous nutrients, vitamins and amino acids. It also thrives very well in these tropical regions of Africa, especially the Southern Nigeria. Armed with this knowledge, I took up the entrepreneurial project of making moringa teas using tea bags because this would not only help a lot of poor people in Nigeria, and Africa in general, who cannot afford or obtain quality health care, but would be a cheap and accessible way of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, since water is a good extraction agent for moringa, moringa teas would provide consumers the maximal health benefits. Even though, I have not had the necessary funding and have been self-funding this project, my motivation to help people live longer and healthier has kept this dream going, and I have not tired out in bringing this to fruition. I am still conducting researches and experiments on my tea, and I have just purchased about two plots of land for moringa farming.

I see two main directions in the discussion so far.\nFirst, there\u2019s the question of creativity and anxiety being intertwined, and how to identify the moment when this anxiety crosses over to a dangerous zone for the artist; also, if this link is a given, how would we go about trying to keep an artist in the safety zone without hindering the creative dimension. Going back to what has been noted so far, the idea of the artist as troubled soul is rooted in the romantic definition of the artist, which I think has long been overcome within contemporary art (and made room for other sources of angst). Nevertheless, apart from this dated, unhealthy perspective, there might be an actual connection between the artistic predisposition and emotional volatility. I haven\u2019t read any studies on this topic, though I suppose this is a strong area of research and only after making sense of the results we might be able to think of strategies for improvement. These might be seen as issues concerning the psychology of arts, which I\u2019m not at all familiar with.\nThen, there is the layer of high (or higher?) anxiety levels within the art world as a result of the pressures of the specific field. Here I\u2019m referring to aspects that could be integrated within the sociology of arts (which I have more understanding of) like rampant competition, status issues (the art world is strongly hierarchical), precarious living/working conditions, high levels of uncertainty (not only of day to day life but the artist\u2019s own\u00a0sense of identity as an artist), market/ commercialization contamination and so on.\nAt one point in his article The Curatorial Muse, Michael J. Kowalski writes: \u201cIt is acknowledged, though not often discussed in polite company until the third drink, that the arts are defined by the same Darwinian savagery as any another profession. It is also acknowledged that the aspiration of art to beauty and truth is a pious fiction, but in the best possible sense of the word. Finally, and crucially, it's acknowledged that these two characteristics of art are seriously and permanently at odds with one another\u201d. - (http://www.contempaesthetics.org)\nOne important idea here is to note that these are not concerning artists only, but art workers in general. It\u2019s difficult for me to say if the levels of anxiety are higher in art that in other professions. A good point was made earlier that these might be found in any other field. My impression is, though, that fields in which creativity is profoundly linked with identity will always make for a more stressful environment. And for those that already identify with the psichological pressures of creativity, this later layer might be just too much to handle.\nJust a few more personal notes: in my discussions with artists I found that many drop out from University because they can\u2019t take the pressure. It might be helpful to note that the myth of the emergent artist will bring the issues I identified before as pertaining to the sociology of art very early on in an artist\u2019s life \u2013 from the first years of university. This young age, one that is related to learning, experimenting, trial and error, finding one\u2019s path etc., has become a battlefield for launching careers. (My one experience brings this even earlier in life, being a child and a teenager trying to become a professional musician. I am one of those who could not handle the difficulties of a musical career at such an early stage in my life and lacking a good support system, so I quit. At present I work as a passionate art professional - curating, arts management, teaching, cultural PR - and I find the field highly demanding, but I feel I have more resources in myself to work my way through, than\u00a0I did when I was a young musician.)\nAnother key point in artists\u2019 lives that my friends who are painters pointed out to me is finishing their studies and trying to make a living through their art and not make compromises. The attention to each decision is overwhelming for most young artists: they need to make a living but most of the times their options put them in a compromising position they know they might not recover from, the art world being so much about reputation management and legitimation. Whenever I think of the contemporary art world I have in my mind the picture of a chess board. One needs to learn the rules of the game by playing, and you only get one round.\nThe other day I was listening to Sarah Thornton, a sociologist of art who was pointing out that ever since Duchamp, the freedom of the artist to fashion herself as an artist is a demigod position that puts a lot of pressure especially on artists finishing studies, whom\u00a0are very much aware of the responsibility of designating themselves as artists. Many would not use the word artist, Thornton notes, and when asked what they do, they say \u201cI do work\u2026\u201d\nOf course, older age comes with its own anxieties within the arts, namely the obsession with youth...", "created_at": "2016-11-25 21:21:21", "updated_at": "2016-11-25 21:21:21", "tag_id": 948, "post_id": 32092, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 647}, {"id": 7805, "text": null, "quote": "particularly that of artists sharing some of those stress-inducing working conditions with non-artists.

Today the Liberties\u00a0is a city neighbourhood of opportunities and innovation, but its history -\u00a0positive and negative -\u00a0pervades.

We did it without them, but for them \u00ad and invited them to join us. It was the first time we came to know some of this population, and the more discovered and understood about them, the more stories and testimonies we collected about their lives, the less sense it made to just wrap everything up and move on to something new.\nOne of the follow\u00adups of this process was a book, in which we gathered and edited short stories from homeless people we\u2019ve met. It was published in both Flemish and French, and it made many institutions hate us, as many people in that book frankly complained about their work.\nOk, we have a bright and pretty broad vision of affairs. Now, what? We had to propose something, and the more I thought of it, the bigger it became in my head. It was overwhelming and ambitions, and I felt I can\u2019t start. That was until I met a woman, who happened to be my former student from the French classes I teach. She was a perfect partner: Flemish, woman, and a businesswoman on top of it. Together we framed the project and made it ripe for implementation in early 2012.\nIt started as a nonprofit in May 2012, but we still took a year to outline some of the details and propose a solid program. It remained complex and ambitious \u00ad and it\u2019s important to keep it that way. The organization managed to raise money from private sources to buy and renovate a building in Brussels (in fact we are still short of renovation money, and we are looking for 500.000 to get the job done). The space is so huge (650 square meters) that we can both offer support to many homeless people and invite other organizations working on the topic to use it. There is another reason why we made it so big \u00ad if the place was small and crowded with homeless from, say, Morocco, a Belgian single homeless person wouldn\u2019t enter, even if we offered what they needed. It would just feel overwhelming.\nThe mission of DoucheFLUX is to promote self\u00ad-esteem and help homeless people regain a positive image of themselves. The activities we propose do not make them feel intimidated. We forbade the usage of the words such as \"culture\" or \"art\" in the space, as well. Together with these precarious people, we produce a magazine, that is published 4\u00ad5 times a year. We also release a monthly broadcast, organize meetings in schools and film debates. Recently, we\u2019ve been busy designing a board game that allows regular people to understand and experience the hardships and challenges of homelessness. The idea wasn\u2019t mine \u00ad one of the homeless people proposed it as a way to engage with passers\u00adby. We are preparing the beta version to be ready for the Brussels Game Festival.\u2028After the opening of the building, which should happen by the end of the year, we will finally extend our services beyond going to the streets and establishing relations with the homeless. We will have 20 showers \u00ad 7 for women, 12 for men, and one for people on wheelchair. There will be also medical area and daily medical staff which our guests can appoint. This simple thing will hopefully fix once and for all the problem with access to showers in Brussels. We\u2019re in the capital of Europe, but for people on the street there is only La Fontaine, which provides one shower per person a week, and you even have to be lucky to get it.\nObviously, if we have showers, we need to have laundry. And the lockers. A huge problem among this community: there are virtually no lockers in Brussels, therefore people constantly get robbed and lose their things. As a result, they end up in a vicious circle of bureaucracy to get back whatever papers and permissions they need, and incredible insecurity. We will have 400 lockers, from super small for medicine and documents, to bigger ones.\nAnd finally, we would like to open a help desk at DoucheFlux one day. Which means we don\u2019t want to become the only organization covering all their needs \u00ad but to provide them with information on where they could be offered help with other problems. We want this to be accompanied by the first centralized website, simple and intuitive so that people who don\u2019t speak French or Flemish will be able to navigate it. It\u2019s incredible how untransparent Brussels is to these people \u00ad they have no idea where to find a lawyer, where to sleep, eat, get their medicine or find work. This idea is supported by everyone from the field in the city.\nWe are also facing some challenges around financing (we think we have reached the limits of private donations in the country at this point) and we consider turning the space into a public-\u00adprivate entity. Our bargaining chip is all our achievement \u00ad we hope the formal institutions will see it as a necessity to support an initiative that has gone so far on its own. We have 50 volunteers, we employ and pay only one person (we want to extend it to at least 2\u00ad3), and all that without a single euro from the state. I\u2019m optimistic about it \u00ad I don\u2019t think anyone would like to see us closed at that point.\nWould you like to share you experience with work with vulnerable social groups?

SHWASHLOCK is the first public service designed on a computer network that I know of.\nSanta Monica's libraries had terminals connected to the PEN, and some homeless residents\u00a0were using the libraries. This is how homeless and homed residents were able to come to share a common hangout, and design together a simple, but very useful service.\u00a0\nIt turns out that online spaces are quite good at removing some of\u00a0the social markers that make interaction across social groups so awkward (and more power to you, @Laurent_d'Ursel , for overcoming that awkardness!). In the words of Donald Paschal, one of the homeless residents:\u00a0\n\u201cPEN is a great equalizer. No one on PEN knew that I was homeless until I told them. After I told them, I was still treated like a human being\u2026 the most remarkable thing about the PEN community is that a City Council member and a pauper can coexist, albeit not always in perfect harmony, but on an equal basis.\u201d\nMore info on SHWASHLOCK and its implications for public participation online:\u00a0http://www.cottica.net/2012/08/29/the-computers-of-the-excluded/", "created_at": "2017-02-26 22:28:07", "updated_at": "2017-02-26 22:28:07", "tag_id": 956, "post_id": 15043, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 694}, {"id": 7851, "text": null, "quote": "Alkasem: i have question to all of you: where are the families of the homeless people?

Two Nurses realized that, despite there being many medical and social organizations in Brussels (Belgium), there were still a great number of homeless people in the Belgian capital. They noticed that personal care and health were major issues for homeless people and were convinced that they could solve these problems.\nThe organization has three primary goals: field work, trainings and tools.\nField work: Street Nurses takes to the streets to meet patients directly in their environment, without asking for payment. We take care of them, earning their trust, and we motivate them to take charge of their personal care and health by accompanying them to specific care facilities, by actively listening to their needs and giving them advice.\nOur work is also based on prevention and the dissemination of health information. We are medical and social intermediaries between, on the one hand, persons who live in an extremely precarious situation and on the other, healthcare professionals and social workers.\nThe follow-up of patients ends with the integration of the patient in accommodation where he or she is regularly supported by professionals and volunteers of Street Nurses, and a network of social associations.\nWe aim to assist persons who live in extremely precarious situations by offering them a home and by permanently reintegrating them into society. This medium- to long-term goal is achieved by improving the living conditions and the hygiene of these individuals, as well as their self-esteem.\nTrainings: Street Nurses organizes different types of awareness-raising sessions and training courses in French or Dutch on \u2018hygiene and precariousness\u2019 and \u2018basic first aid\u2019.\u00a0 These trainings are address to any target group that is likely to come into direct contact with homeless people or that works with people who live at home and have major hygiene issues. Our nurses organize sessions on site \u2013 in schools, in the offices of security guards and social workers, clinics etc.\nTools: Street Nurses develops prevention tools and information packages to raise awareness among homeless persons about the importance of personal care and health, to give them better access to care and to facilitate their medium - to long-term rehabilitation. Certain tools, however, are aimed at raising awareness among the general public about the situation of homeless people. Examples: list of showers in Brussels, map of fountains and free public conveniences, symptoms and interventions in case of hypothermia, Frostbite prevention poster, Heat stroke prevention poster\nSince 2005 the non-profit organization Street nurses has grown and its projects are continuously developed. Today, Street Nurses has the equivalent of 13,84 full-time staff members and approximately 60 volunteers.\nWe saw the call by the Mac Arthur Foundation too, but we tough we were way to small to try and get it so we were very happy to receive the information trough DoucheFLux that this kind of initiative exists. We are mostly organized to search every year for new funds. We try to find the good balance between private, public and foundation funds but because of our high costs of wages it is difficult to fund foundations that are willing to support us. Most of them give only money for material or structural projects, not for day to day tasks, and that is what Street Nurses is all about.\nSince a couple of years we opened our work to an even more inclusive service. We have a collaboration going on with Social housing agencies in Brussels to try to give homeless people a decent home at the end. We participate to the program Housing First Brussels.\nWe have a good network within the association field in Brussels, but when we go to specific funds we are not transcribed in their goals. For example, they help by giving furniture for kids, or funds for kid projects. But our main audience, people living on the street between 8 and 20 years is often forgotten.\nSomething rather unique in the social field is that we have one of our colleagues that is paid by two different organizations, ours and another non-profit organization. This makes it possible to create a solid bridge between both organizations and have a great information flow. We think there is bright future is this way of work.\nFinally we organize a colloquium the 20th of October in Brussels that has as goal to eradicate homelessness in Brussels for ever. With the mindset: if even we can find homes for the most difficult audience, you can too! We want to share our experience in the field. It takes time and dedication for each of our people to do the whole process, from getting the confidence, to willing to have a stable home. But we want to show that the hard work also has direct results, and if we rally our forces we can go for a total abolishment of homelessness in Brussels!", "created_at": "2017-04-17 22:48:51", "updated_at": "2017-04-17 22:48:51", "tag_id": 956, "post_id": 767, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 734}, {"id": 7855, "text": null, "quote": "If you want to personalize with few resources - try making your own paint.

The very nice volunteer Berivan showed us around and we had the chance to talk directly with the people.\nThe first time we visited I was surprised how \u201egood\u201c the atmosphere was. I somehow always thought a refugee camp would be a very sad place, but children were running around playing and everyone was kind of open and nice to each other (from my point of view).\u00a0\nThe ICC Messe is a former congress centrum which was recently rebuilt\u00a0to be a refugee camp. The Big Main Hall is segmented with thin white walls into something like 40 rooms that look like roofless boxes. Instead of doors there are blankets and towels covering the entrances. There are no windows; in this main Hall the light comes from tubes in the ceiling.\u00a0Inside of each room there are 4 bunk beds, so in total 8 people per room\u00a0(familys are usually separated and live in private rooms, also: the rooms are separated by gender).\nUsually the rooms don't have any kind of furniture inside, but the one we were sitting in had a big picnic table and a bench and also a bunch of office chairs. We got offered very sweet black Tea in plastic cups and started sharing stories.\u00a0\nFirstly we asked how people organize themselves in the room.\nThe Camp is designed for people to stay around three months, but most of the people are staying six or more. There are only the bare necessities provided. For example there are no possibilities to unpack the backpacks or suitcases, which are probably unpacked since the beginning of the journey. Thats why the people find solutions, for example they pull out nails from the wall and hang their cloth on these nails. Or they found a piece of metal string which they also used to hang cloth from. There are also some card boxes used as bed table and chest. Hussam (who is diligently learning German) pointed at one of the card boxes saying \u201eK\u00fchlschrank\u201c. We were laughing but it was true! tomatoes, cans of beans and a lot of eggs were stored\u00a0there. Also under the bed was a lot of food (maybe the darkest and coldest spot in the room). The reason for that is that they don't always like food by the caterer and of course you get hungry between the official \u201emeals\u201c. They boil the eggs in a water cooker by the way!\u00a0\nAnother interesting observation was a little plastic cup full of washing powder.(they usually give the dirty cloth away to the washing and get them back clean) Hussam told us that he likes his shirts to be without creases and because there is no way to iron,he washes them with his hands and drys them in the room. That was eye opening for me because, yes they might have nothing but they have dignity and preferences! they start a living.\nAlso very interesting is that in the bunk beds the bottom bed is the preferred bed because they can build a little privacy by hanging towels and sheets at the upper bed. The upper bed is always dependent on the main light system which is switched off at 11 in the night.\nBerivan told us that in one room they build constructions out of a broken bunk bed so that also the upper bed could shield from the light.\nAnother very striking construction was a piece of wood sticked to the wall with duct tape which was supposed to be a smartphone shelf, to watch movies at night.\nAlso they put pictures from magazines on the wall to make the atmosphere a little more cosy.\nBut still even if they find the possibility to hack something there is a lot of stuff just flying around in the room.\nThere was a lot of creativity to make the most out of the given, bit still no tools or materials. Berivan told us they used to give out tools, but because they never came back so there are no tools anymore.\u00a0What if we could support the already existing creativity by opening a space for tools and materials? encouraging them with their ideas and hacks?", "created_at": "2017-01-22 22:04:27", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 22:04:27", "tag_id": 962, "post_id": 681, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 648}, {"id": 7880, "text": null, "quote": "Hello,\u00a0\nWe are Lotfi and Selvi,\u00a0a couple of engaged people with an eclectic cultural background.

This is partly because we are a small crowded island and could do with more houses but it is also because we have an excess of money, and it tends to accumulate in the hands of a minority.\nIn care, the result is that individuals and even the state find it increasingly hard to acquire care homes and they attract private equity and hedge funds who treat staff as human \"resources\" and patients as \"consumers\" of health care services, squeezing the system to extract wealth.\nThis is, arguably, an extreme way of presenting the situation (after all, even hedge funds have to employ managers, many of whom are very professional and caring). However the fact is that having \"owners\" who have different drivers and values from the care-givers causes a tension that too often results in quality of care taking second place to \"delivery of health services\", which is quite a different thing.\nA useful parallel is the struggle many communities have to create affordable housing. An interesting and succesful innovation has been the community land trust, where land is acquired by or on behalf of the community and held in trust over the long term. They make the land available for affordable housing. Separating out the ownership of the land from the occupation of the land allows people who couldn't otherwise afford to occupy the land to come in and use it, subject to the conditions set down by the trust. We imagine a similar type of structure.\nTo put it another way, using financial language, owning land has a different time horizon and a different risk profile\u00a0 from owning a business. A care home that separates the two can attract different sorts of capital for the two different needs, and thus more closely match the interests of the investors with the interests of the stakeholders.

We are convinced that the magic happens by connecting citizen\u2019s skills and needs. We aim to become a laboratory for urban change hosting citizens in search of anchor.\u2019\nBut Huis VDH doesn\u2019t fall from the sky. For me, being in good care in the city has always meant having a healthy living environment. To create such a good environment we need good city planners and a great vision on public space. Something Brussels is still lacking...\nOnce upon a time, there was public space.\nFrom 2012\u00a0onwards, I got fascinated by the concept of public space and how to bring it back in the center of everyday life in the city. After reading a call by philosopher Philippe Van Parijs about the urge to design new ways to interact in public space because of the limits of private space in the city, I got involved in Pic Nic The Streets and Canal Park BXL that both asked the government to urgently work on citizen based public space to better the living conditions of each citizen. Both won the political battle, but the result wasn\u2019t really what we were hoping for. Pic Nic The Streets led to a carfree city center, but so poorly planned that a strong movement of anti carfree people could rise and are now threatening to stop \u00a0further reorganisation of the city center. Looking at the plans for the big park, we are scared that gentrification will become an even bigger issue now in the zone around Canal Park. We were hoping for an inclusive design knowing that a lot of poor people are living in that neighbourhood. Now we are continuing to work as an observer with a cargo bike installation called Canal d\u2019Accroche (part of the project V\u00e9lo M2, explained here) in that neighbourhood, hoping to bring them some resilience.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 21:24:51", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 21:24:51", "tag_id": 962, "post_id": 520, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 487}, {"id": 7886, "text": null, "quote": "From Maison Du People to Huis VDH, a story about citizen centred design.\nSince I was a guide and learned about the architect Horta and his Art Nouveau Style, I\u2019m fascinated with the Maison Du Peuple, a building from the end of the 19th century that housed all kind of projects and people wanting to better society. It was a place where ideals could grow, and people could come listen to each other in an open dialogue. I started working on an open call to repurpose the empty Bourse building into a new Maison Du Peuple, right in the hearth of the city. But just days after finishing the text the attacks in Bataclan occurred and life in Brussels changed dramatically for a couple of weeks\u2026\nI gave it a rest and set my focus on a vacant building above the well-known music bar Bonnefooi: 4 floors, 500m2, and lots of potential, but also lots of work to be done. Without any budget or action plan, I started gathering people in the house, now called Huis VDH. The only thing I knew was that I wanted an inclusive project build from a common idea: Designing a semi-public space in such a way that the wellbeing of the neighbourhood / city improves. Huis VDH will therefore become a test case, because it isn\u2019t the first or last vacant space above a shop in Brussels: there are more than 23 000 m2 documented.\nSo there we were, having a space, an open concept and a lot of potential. The first thing we did was taking time to create a common practice: we designed our way of gathering through a futurism session created by Fo.AM that allowed us to gather all ideas from each person who wanted to get involved and, like a funnel, filter only the most common. For us, it was important to make Huis VDH as open as possible, so that any new member with the right mind-set could easily become a full involved partner in the building process. After a philosophical six months, we had the sprout of an idea: Huis VDH was born.\nIt\u2019s all in the name, for Huis VDH it is no other. \u2018Huis\u2019 means \u2018home\u2019 in Dutch and that is what we are aiming to become for people that are drowning in a sea of complexity of city life. We try to not judge each other, but rather think solution oriented: Help out where we can, and bring the right people around the table. Our space is designed to welcome each kind of small organization working on local issues: cultural, social or technological. We try to design each space so it can be multifunctional and become a temporary rest spot for thosein search of an anchor. We believe like edgeryders: \u201c that the power of a community is bigger than the sum of all parts.\u201d\nOne big challenge we will be facing in the next couple of years is to use our talent to organize ourselves within crisis. Big problems are ahead and we need to build up resilience to react quickly to an ever changing surrounding. Huis VDH is trying to take that challenge inside our own development. For us resilience can be developed on four levels: knowledge, vulnerability, out of the box exercise, and modification.\nShared knowledge\nOpen Source is all around us, and also in Huis VDH. After living for 5 weeks in an open source innovation camp called POC21, I find solutions to every kind of problem through this model of thinking. Knowledge is there to be shared and if we create the right methodology we will find more easily solutions to any kind of problems. That is why we started mapping out every encounter we had through metamaps, we budget our work with cobudget and use a sharing file system inside the house.\nShowing your vulnerable self\nWhen working in a collective environment, we tend to show our better self, hiding our flaws in the first place. But a strong collective group is as strong as its weakest link, and therefore we find it important that we are open and honest to each other. Having personal problems is something common, but sharing them is less. We try to create a trust field around Huis VDH where personal development is as important as the common goal of the organization. Caring about each other as a human being before seeing it as a resource for a project. In order to bring this theory into practice, we have made the first floor as cosy as possible, so people can just hang around and talk freely to each other. We make meetings short and efficient so there is time to discuss at the bar the more intimate stuff, not with all, but with whom we trust.\nPutting ourselves outside the system\nIn the first six months, I was convinced we could create a complete system without the need of money. Only through exchange we could rebuild the house. This gave us a clear barrier to work around, and even if after six months we partially let money in our system, we were trained to think about solutions without money by using the skills, knowledge and resources of one another. This is one of the many ways we try to build challenges to ourselves to constantly think out of the box. When crisis occurs, we need to think and find solutions fast. Creating these exercises in a calm period will help create resilience in all members.\nModification as constancy\nFinally, another way resilience can be created is by being in a constantly changing environment. Therefore Huis VDH doesn\u2019t have fixed spaces. Every room can be rearranged to have a different use. Having this as one of the ground rules, we create a constant reality of change that makes us well trained in the art of adaptation, a virtue needed in times of crisis. In September, we will be, thanks to @Nadia, hosting the Open Care Weekend for Brussels.We see it as an opportunity to use our space for a common goal and adapt it while having people using the space. It will be our first external happening and we are really excited.\nWhen working for Huis VDH, I have a phrase by Bachelard that always comes to mind: \u201cOur House is our first universe, a real cosmos in every sense of the word\u201d We can\u2019t forget about the complexity of a home when we want to harmonize it. In cosmos, planets collide, new stars are born and a black hole sometimes sucks up even galaxies. This will be the same for people, ideas and principles. The most important for the wellbeing of this microcosm will be the search for constant balance.\nIn September we will be co-hosting the Brussels OPENandChange Workshop and that will kick off our Huis VDH. In the follow up we are working on a concept called Pirate Kitchen: using the resources from dumpster diving or own grown combined with hobby cooks we want to bring each week around 10 people gravitating around the same interest / problem / field but don\u2019t know or rarely meet. We wouldn\u2019t give them any explanation about whom they will meet, only that they will have a dinner with interesting \u00a0people. They will have to find out why they are all here, and what they could bring to each other. A sort of blind date for change makers. Could this be an interesting form, or does it already occur in some places?\nI\u2019d appreciate any feedback in a comment below, and see you on 10-11 September for the workshop! \u00a0\nThe production of this\u00a0article was supported by\u00a0Op3n\u00a0Fellowships\u00a0-\u00a0an ongoing program for community contributors\u00a0during May - November 2016.", "created_at": "2017-01-22 21:25:01", "updated_at": "2017-01-22 21:25:01", "tag_id": 962, "post_id": 520, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 487}, {"id": 7901, "text": null, "quote": "The fourth category\u00a0connects with what Dougie Strang of Dark Mountain referred to during our chat as \u2018deep encounters\u2019 and this is something that I'm keen to\u00a0explore further.

It's quite large as cohousing goes, and while several values are common, there is also much diversity. Some minority groups find a home here: in our case, including vegans. We try to be inter-generational, though there are more older people than younger. That's partly due to economic factors.\nIt is a surprisingly complex little society, and any group like this has its own life, its own character, which would take a long time to describe. For Opencare, I'd like to focus just on one of the challenges that I see here: how we engage with our own and each other's well-being. We have at present no special provision for caring for each other: it happens in some ways at some times, informally.\nSharing some non-mainstream values, and a vision that is not yet shared by the majority of people, there seems to be some kind of assumption that we will provide a safe space for \"people like us\", a haven from the strain of being minorities who are disregarded, or even criticised, elsewhere. This need for a sense of psychological safety does appear in various ways, sometimes surprisingly. This is often hidden in the rest of society. Otherwise, our needs are probably similar to most people's.\nWe do have methods for dealing with conflict, but the challenge seems to be to get people to engage with them. Recently, a small group of members underwent training in Restorative Circles [https://www.restorativecircles.org/]. If we all understood and participated in this, it might help deal with issues that have surfaced. Relatedly, several members have developed, to differing degrees, along the path of Nonviolent Communication [https://www.cnvc.org/]. If we all interacted with each other following NVC principles, maybe that would be a highly positive influence on our community culture, and the well-being of all of us. But how does one persuade a diverse group of people with different backgrounds and histories to engage in one practice like NVC? What about other practices, like co-counselling?\nThis brings me to outlining the challenges that I, personally, see for our cohousing group. How do we collectively approach the issue of mental and spiritual well-being, with little common ground to start with? How can we then grow (in) a culture that effectively supports the well-being of individuals, and of the group as a whole? How can we be sure that an individual will receive the care that they need? Can we rely on informal relationships, or should we organise this in some way? Part of our well-being is the sharing of common purpose: how can we frame and agree our common purposes, from members whose values diverge? Are we fixed with the vision of the founders, or can we (and do we want to) move on?\nThese are hard questions to answer, but I have the sense that we will need to answer them more and more, if we are to develop the resilience that we will need as mainstream politics and economics unravel. We need now to care for each other's resources of time, energy and good will, and as we age, we will increasingly need to look after our health and strength if we are to achieve what we want to achieve, being a positive transformative influence in the world.", "created_at": "2017-05-17 19:25:58", "updated_at": "2017-05-17 19:25:58", "tag_id": 962, "post_id": 830, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 797}, {"id": 7892, "text": null, "quote": "But the process for joining involves a lot of face time with community members over a number of visits and meetings. \u00a0I assume that when it comes to\u00a0a vote \u00a0for admitting someone, most everyone considers the whole person and whether or not they will be good cohousing companions.", "created_at": "2017-05-20 20:00:46", "updated_at": "2017-05-20 20:00:46", "tag_id": 962, "post_id": 15392, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 797}, {"id": 7893, "text": null, "quote": "I'd say any climate is suitable for a tiny house if it is well designed and built.

I have realized that you have made me move through wide and small environments\u2026 but I haven\u2019t been able to identify where I was.\u201d\nIrene: \u201cThat\u2019s already quite good Mario! I have only given you one point for each environment, and you have already been able to tell something about them\u2026 you are the best! We will focus on learning curves and performances later again, can you tell me anything else about your general impressions at the moment?\u201d\nMario: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell you more from just this\u2026 maybe we can move to the next exercise?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cYes, here we go. Get ready, and now I will let you walk through the environment of today, and you will hear repeated clicks\u2026 try to guess what it would be\u201d\nJust a quick run of the new scenario on the simulator\nMario: \u201chmmm\u2026 the smoothness has improved a lot\u2026 but I really could not tell you what it is. It seems a large environment, I have been getting away from a wall and after getting closer to another?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cI had told you would not have an easy life, after those jokes about our engineer Mario! But you did quite well. It was a cathedral\u2026 now that I have told you, could you confirm it or would you still be doubtful?\u201d\nMario: \u201cLet me try to listen again\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2026the simulator runs again shortly\nMario: \u201cYes Irene, now that I know, it could well be\u2026 I had some doubts, with no context it could have been a theater or a large gym, \u2026\u201d\nIrene: \u201cIndeed\u2026 now I would like you to do a few exercises\u2026 I will tell you this time what you are going to listen to, precisely, and you will have to focus on the features\u2026 later there will be a test\u2026\u201d\nMario: \u201cFor me or for the software?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cFor both, Mario, don\u2019t try to escape your responsibilities\u201d\nMario: \u201cAhahah\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey run the training set\nMario: \u201cWell Irene, we will see how I perform later\u2026 but you should consider developing an interface to feed information about structures, volumes, and positions, directly to your users\u2026 it is nice to chat with you, but if you really think of this as a tool for making echolocation training accessible to anyone, the fact that you need to have by your side another person as your interface to the system doesn\u2019t add up\u201d\nIrene: \u201cYou are right. Together with the real-time acquisition of users\u2019 clicks, this interface is at the top of our list of priorities. We are thinking of using a simple tablet of mechanically executed needles to offer a map of the space being tested and a natural interface\u2026 or some haptic 3D interface, but that may be more expensive and complicated. We have not yet looked into that enough\u201d\nMario: \u201cYou would need a lot of needles to offer a useful interface\u2026 you can try prototyping something quick maybe with Arduino\u2026 but I would be a lot more curious about the haptic interface. I have seen some applications with holograms and they looked impressive.\u201d\nIrene: \u201cWe will keep this in mind. Of course, we need to make it as simple and cheap as possible, but still functional\u2026 and we hope the prices of that hardware will be democratized soon. Now that we have taken a small break\u2026\u201d\nMario: \u201cWhat break? Are you not letting me off yet?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cMario, let\u2019s just take the test before the coffee\u2026 I will let you off then, for today\u201d\nMario: \u201cOk, ok\u2026 a no is not possible anyway, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nIrene: \u201cIt\u2019s always possible, but I will insist with a smile\u201d\nThey run the tests\nIrene: \u201dif we compare today\u2019s performances to those from the last tests, both with the software and in the lab with the moving panels, you have really gotten better Mario!\u201d\nMario: \u201cBut Irene, how can I be sure if I have truly learned? I mean\u2026 we should arrange tests where there are coupled with some sort of benchmark\u2026 maybe similar tests in real world, you could imagine a mobile lab to do so\u2026 or even just arrange competitions among users\u201d\nIrene: \u201cThat\u2019s a really good idea, Mario! We will seriously reflect on how to arrange this, but for the time being\u2026 do you think your partner would like to try it out against you?\u201d\nMario: \u201cBut she sees\u2026\u201d\nIrene: \u201cit should not be an advantage, and I promise you I will not show her the screen\u201d\nThis is now a different story\u2026 but after being initially baffled, Mario\u2019s partner took it to her heart to seriously compete with him, and in the end, she won one of the tests, confirming anyone can learn this skill.\n1\u00a0Please be reminded that Mario is a blind guy.

When ever an adolescent brings up a topic around \u00a0reproductive health or sex \u00a0education, they are usually severely punished \u00a0and regarded as been disrespectful to their elders. Due to this absence of discussion on sex education, many adolescent young girls face lots of challenges and stigma at their puberty stage, especially during menstruation.Most parents in Cameroon especially in the rural and grassroots areas, don't know that they have to provide pads for their girl children during menstruation. They don't even give their girls advice when these children even summon a little courage to inform them that something abnormal is happening with them .According to many parents, these children are very immature and still very young to be able to handle understand and process issues on puberty , reproductive health and menstruation. Because of this lack of discussion between parents and children on sex education, many of these girls, during menstruation are forced to stay away from school because of stigma from boys who often notice blood stains on their uniforms and also the unpleasant odor which \u00a0cames out of the bodies as a result. \u00a0Their staying away from school, makes them not to be performant as they ought to be like the boys and this plays a key role for their poor performances. Some stay away for two weeks and others for a month, just to avoid this stigma. As a youth advocate to encourage parent children dialogue on sex education and advoacting for Access to reproductive health knowledge, i have had time to hold some trainings with a few groups of adolescent girls to tell me about their experiences. \u00a0As a result of lack of menstrual hygiene, due to absence of \u00a0dialogue between them and their parents, \u00a0i was amazed by the stories i got. Some said, as they approached their parents \u00a0when\u00a0they noticed boold stains on their pants, they were thoroughly scolded and driven away and warned never to discuss any thing on menstruation. Some said, they were forced to carry dry dust and sand to\u00a0insert into their vaginas in order to stop the bleeding as they knew not what was happening to them. Other stories came up like using \u00a0dirty clothes to pad themselves, which was very in hygienic and gave them some genital infections. \u00a0As a result of this lack of knowledge on reproductive health for adolescent girls, many have dropped out of school because of unintended pregnancies, some have contracted sexually transmissable infections and others have been forced into early marriages , to the boys that impregnated them. Many of these \u00a0adolecents have lost hope for a better future, because they are now in condtions due to necglect and lack of reproductive health knowledge. \u00a0so i am hoping to enlightened parents and the community about the importance of sex education and also advocating for this curriculum to be taught in primary and secondary schools in Cameroon. I am hoping, to equally train these adolescent girls on matters of gender equality, menstrual hygiene , family planning and reproductive health as a Whole. In Africa, there is an ardage which says \"Charity begins at home\" if \u00a0discussions between parents and children are initiated at home on sex education, it will go an extra mile to enable parents understand their daughters and support them effectively , so that they will not be statistics of unwanted pregnancies , school drop outs and poor academic performance in school. If Access to knowledge on reproductive health is improved upon \u00a0for parents and adolescent girls, then sustainable development will be ensured.

My goal here is to let people be aware of issues whose practices has created a negative impact on th lives of Cameroonians and Africans.

As i pointed out in my article, theis alone makes young people vulnerable to wrong practices \u00a0and getting information from doubtful sources to help themselves.

It's quite large as cohousing goes, and while several values are common, there is also much diversity. Some minority groups find a home here: in our case, including vegans. We try to be inter-generational, though there are more older people than younger. That's partly due to economic factors.\nIt is a surprisingly complex little society, and any group like this has its own life, its own character, which would take a long time to describe. For Opencare, I'd like to focus just on one of the challenges that I see here: how we engage with our own and each other's well-being. We have at present no special provision for caring for each other: it happens in some ways at some times, informally.\nSharing some non-mainstream values, and a vision that is not yet shared by the majority of people, there seems to be some kind of assumption that we will provide a safe space for \"people like us\", a haven from the strain of being minorities who are disregarded, or even criticised, elsewhere. This need for a sense of psychological safety does appear in various ways, sometimes surprisingly. This is often hidden in the rest of society. Otherwise, our needs are probably similar to most people's.\nWe do have methods for dealing with conflict, but the challenge seems to be to get people to engage with them. Recently, a small group of members underwent training in Restorative Circles [https://www.restorativecircles.org/]. If we all understood and participated in this, it might help deal with issues that have surfaced. Relatedly, several members have developed, to differing degrees, along the path of Nonviolent Communication [https://www.cnvc.org/]. If we all interacted with each other following NVC principles, maybe that would be a highly positive influence on our community culture, and the well-being of all of us. But how does one persuade a diverse group of people with different backgrounds and histories to engage in one practice like NVC? What about other practices, like co-counselling?\nThis brings me to outlining the challenges that I, personally, see for our cohousing group. How do we collectively approach the issue of mental and spiritual well-being, with little common ground to start with? How can we then grow (in) a culture that effectively supports the well-being of individuals, and of the group as a whole? How can we be sure that an individual will receive the care that they need? Can we rely on informal relationships, or should we organise this in some way? Part of our well-being is the sharing of common purpose: how can we frame and agree our common purposes, from members whose values diverge? Are we fixed with the vision of the founders, or can we (and do we want to) move on?\nThese are hard questions to answer, but I have the sense that we will need to answer them more and more, if we are to develop the resilience that we will need as mainstream politics and economics unravel. We need now to care for each other's resources of time, energy and good will, and as we age, we will increasingly need to look after our health and strength if we are to achieve what we want to achieve, being a positive transformative influence in the world.", "created_at": "2017-05-17 19:28:00", "updated_at": "2017-05-17 19:28:00", "tag_id": 1016, "post_id": 830, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 797}, {"id": 27246, "text": "", "quote": "So, it's interesting that a machine-learning powered translation tool would default to the formal", "created_at": "2020-12-01 18:01:32.602638", "updated_at": "2020-12-01 18:01:32.602638", "tag_id": 8002, "post_id": 76159, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 13245}, {"id": 8045, "text": null, "quote": "The issues you're facing in your cohousing community actually sound a lot like the type we face in my university, especially how to align views on wellbeing when everyone comes from varied backgrounds, with sometimes completely\u00a0divergent perspectives.\nOne thing we've taken to doing, in order to give a space for the range of views and thoughts\u00a0on these topics is we hold semesterly fishbowl discussions.

The old movie theater \u00a0in the city centre, a beautiful building with a rich history and emotional meaning for\u00a0a lot of people, was bought by project developers after bankruptcy. They plan to install service flats where elderly that are still okay can live in co-housing with people who need care, like other elderly or young people with a disability.

Whether its students living with the care homes and volunteering to have the elderly care for the young, it\u2019s a circle.\nThis may also be of interest\nConnecting generations is not just a \"nice idea\" I think it\u2019s necessary. For the younger generation who may have not had the presence of grandparents or the presence of older generations creating an influence in their life this is an added value for them, it connects the past, present and future in one conversation. Whether you\u2019re at either end of life- there are similarities.\u00a0\nThere are tremendous benefits of these connections. There is a lot of talk to help older people, but perhaps they can help the young. It's the experiences of life in a multigenerational, interdependent, abstract community that, more than anything else, teaches us how to be human. The older generation often is faced with isolation- which in turn creates the backdrop for cognitive decline. We all know that. If we can improve the standing of older adults in society, and nurture what they can bring through to the table, then we can achieve a better community with a better quality of life for all ages. With their practical knowledge, some may use the term wisdom, gained from experience, and because they carry with them a whole world lost to younger generation, they may well be our greatest social capital.
