With this thought exercise I will be funnelling impressions into a more streamlined building block for people who are passionate by politics but are frustrated by the status quo of a dualistic political system. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are in Montreal complaining about the \u2018uncoordinated traffic works\u2019, in Rotterdam finding the investments in \u2018de markthal\u2019 unnecessary or in Rouen hearing about a latest talent. Most probably this is the same in almost every big occidental city. So maybe it isn\u2019t the politicians incapacity but an overall problem in the way we look at societal problems.\n\n\nA trust crisis in all European Democracies\n\nFirst we have to tackle the elephant in the room: the majority of Europeans don\u2019t trust their politicians. When looking at the level of trust, only Denmark scores above 50%, where some countries go as low as 18%. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter if the country was ruled by the left, centre or right, there is simply a giant fatigue in our democracy. Every now and then a political party claims to be the solution, but none of them deliver. Why: because they are still playing by the same old rulebook. \n \n It\u2019s important to understand this principle of rulebook, one held by every politician to succeed in the world of politics. Don\u2019t see it as a literal book, but a group of unwritten rules, codes and internal structures that make politics what it is today: hierarchical, opaque and centralized. That is why we see more and more legacy politicians running (sons, daughters, husbands and wives of\u2026), because they have direct access to the best version of the rulebook. It becomes also clearer, that being a politician is a career move, stretching from early years of volunteering till your pension. There is no time for a vocation of a couple of years fighting for one topic, because understanding the rulebook became so complicated.\n\nThis creates an enclave only inhabited by the happy and initiated few. While our technology makes it easier to create decentralized and transparent platforms, our politicians are still holding on to old fashioned methods, where control of power and knowledge is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the political elites.\n\nClassic politics are still playing at monopoly\n\nBut when looking back to the last couple of years, we as democratic people aren\u2019t moving as fast as our technology is. We had a big economic crisis in 2008 and haven\u2019t had the feeling the politics have changed for a better regulation of the banks. On a more local level we have still scandals popping up like popcorns on a hot plate every time there is an election near. \n \n You could argue that we had a bad generation of politicians, and that next time it will be better but that would be a bit short sighted. What if it was the democratic system that was rigged because it got to hard intertwined with a neo-liberal ethos? We created such enormous money hungry beast, that they become too big to fail (Banks again, anybody?) It\u2019s like our politicians are playing the same monopoly game again and again hoping that at the end of the game the winner would be somebody else then the one controlling the most power (=money). Could it be that it\u2019s the rules that are intended to always go towards the cash grab? So when will our politicians start playing a game like \u2018choose your happiness (Soft Revolution 2015) instead of replaying monopoly each time. And don\u2019t see this as leftist critique towards liberal economics, also all leftist parties are playing the same economical driven game but they are too na\u00efve to understand that they could never win the game anymore without cheating. We don\u2019t need more \u2018buying power\u2019, or simply put better wages and less taxes, we need an ethical correct system.\n\n\nIntroducing a new game\n\nWell here is a new game, or even better: the creation of a new rulebook from where you can play any game you want. This is where the participationists come into play. In the last couple of years we saw organizations popping up willing to change the way we play the game, from some groups of the Pirate Party, citizen lists (Madrid and Barcelona being the most well-known) to Brussels based groups as We Brussels and Civic Innovation Network. While the bigger ones had problems changing the rules and being often institutionalized, the smaller ones are learning from it and bringing new insights to the table. Here are a few core values shared by many of these groups\n\n- Transparency: a true politician has to be there for his constituents, instead of trusting that he / she will be honest, create rules where it is impossible to hide political decisions. A true person of the people needs to understand that her/his role isn\u2019t one of anonymity but he/ she is a representation of a group of people.\n\n- Decentralisation of power: when power comes into play, the chances of corruption become bigger, that\u2019s a correlation shown multiple times in this article. So why are we still giving politics the benefit of the doubt while we know centralised power creates escalation. Let us work on systems that don\u2019t need this centralized power, but gives lots of people opportunities to flourish in societal engagement.\n\n- Shared knowledge: Like transparency, shared knowledge is one of the fundaments for a more ethical politics. Knowledge is power, and centralised power creates unbalanced politics. So why would we be ok with closed knowledge. Politicians have to share their data, because their data serves society and shouldn\u2019t be possible to use for political gain.\n\n- Longevity of projects, not of people: We should make it more difficult to create career politicians and invest in collective intelligence that could tackle long and complicated projects. The idea comes maybe from one person, but the determination to make it happen is better in an environment of collaboration instead of competition.\n\nWhere are the participationists?\n \n We\u2019re coming to it. The role of the particationists is to fight for this other way of politics, not by trying to get elected themselves, but by infusing the main ideas in the world of politics. Like the green movement did in the 70\u2019s but without the error of willing to get into power too. The participationist will be a \u2018sacrificed generation\u2019 that will not run for a spot, but will push new rules and make it possible to create a new way of doing politics.", "created_at": "2018-07-16 08:35:44.727349", "updated_at": "2018-07-16 08:35:44.727349", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1172, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 135.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4085], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33685, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6249, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Not sure if this is happening anymore, but wanted to give @alex_levene a heads up that we're releasing a first version of the festival program - pretty full by now - next week. \n\nIt would be a pity if after all the conversations and exhibitions last year around the issue of refugee care and new economic models we dont have anything in the Festival program..", "created_at": "2017-07-28 14:43:06.307674", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:05.151819", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 64, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 51.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34639, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 6249, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Hi Noemi,\n\nSorry to have gone so quiet.

What are the G8 &amp; G20 Youth Summits? The G8 &amp; G20 Youth Summits are a civil society conference that assembles students and young professionals from G8 and G20 countries for one week each year to develop proposed solutions to current global problems. Delegates assume roles (e.g., president, minister of finance, etc.) while representing their countries and employ the informal, consensus-based methods of negotiation adopted by the real G8 and G20. Beyond simply playing roles, however, delegates also offer their countries\u2019 youth perspectives on important issues. The summits conclude with the signing of a final communiqu\u00e9 representing the consensus of all the ministerial committees for the G8 and the G20 on the topics that have been discussed. Many delegations subsequently return to their home countries and present this document to government officials and civil society representatives.\n\nExperiences like these can empower the youth, by giving us the chance to shape the future we want and to influence the civil society.\u00a0 It's not about age or political parties, it's about to be passionate and responsible!!!<img alt=\"\" class=\"imagecache-Featured\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Featured/542927_290801311015321_1459730554_n.jpg\" title=\"\">\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 23:13:03", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 11:45:37.182216", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 250, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13120, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1654, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>I agree with you all, but..</b>\n\nmy question was: do we need to formulate something clearly or our experiences are self-explanatory and already useful enough to inform higher levels?

It's like in science, in the famous Max Planck quotation: <em>\"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it\"</em>. Senior professors have both the power and the incentives to block the advancement.

Every week the producers runs a one hour online video, document what is said, and publish\u00a0it as a short post in the <a href=\"/t/how-to-festival-coordination/761\">Openvillage</a><a href=\"/t/how-to-festival-coordination/761\">- Coordination group</a>. The weekly calls always take place on the same day and same time every week to simplify communication. Ahead of each call, they prepare an agenda for what will be discussed, and publish it in the form of an event on eventbright/FB. Time estimate: 3 hrs/ weekly call.\n\n2. The monthly\u00a0evening talk and dinner. The producers crowdsource a calendar of interesting events taking place in Belgium (Brussels). They then build partnerships with the organisers of the events to organise evening talks and dinners to which people who attend the main events are invited as featured speakers.

Not so romantic, haha. At first glance, I liked the project quite well. A few days later, at second glance, the project really excited me - I began to like the project as such as well as my vision of my place within that project.\n\n_Biochemistry, travelling and a new beginning_\nWhen I started studying biochemistry at Masaryk University in 2007 at the age of 19, I didn't really know why I chose to study biochemistry. (Now I think that then it would not be a bad idea having this choice thought a bit more carefully or consulted with somebody more deeply. Well, later in life, it had returned to me.) Anyway, I did quite well in my studies. I really enjoyed gaining knowledge about how the micro-world around us works. I studied the patterns of chemical interactions, the mind-blowing life of bacteria or the processes that underlie functions in the human body. I have studied in depth the spatial (3D) structure of biomolecules. Also, thanks to my studies I could travel a lot. In 2010 I spent a semester in Salvador, Brasil, and, after, three semesters in Grenoble, France. That's when I discovered my great passions: backpacking and mountaineering. Thanks to scientific achievements from Grenoble, I was able to work in the most prestigious scientific institutions - in Heidelberg and Vienna. At that time, I began to realize that the researcher's life was no longer for me, and that I had never actually suited for it personality-wise.\n\nWith the beginning of 2018, after four years spent in Vienna I have returned to my hometown of Brno, where I began to look for a new direction in life. I still do science part-time, but I'd rather like to work with people than in an office. And I want to do something that actually matters a lot to me, something that makes sense to me. But indeed, I also tried a few things that didn't make too much sense :)\n\n_What I'm doing now_\nNow, things are far more clear, knowing much better what I am good at, what suits me and knowing that I want to engage heavily in the environmental questions and the questions related to a dignified and meaningful life. At Masaryk University I am now part-time managing the preparation of an international project for the Horizon2020 program to support environmental education. Within the project I coordinate cooperation between faculties of several universities, municipalities, scientific institutions, non-profit organizations and organic farms. I would also like to focus heavily on promoting active citizenship and volunteering.\n\nIn the context of all this, I am very excited by the chance to participate in the PopRebel project. I'd be glad to launch more debates on what makes us happy, what bothers us, what can improve our livelihoods or what can undermine our well-being.", "created_at": "2019-08-06 09:21:15.503326", "updated_at": "2019-08-14 09:36:41.674417", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 921, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 212.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4779, 3, 137, 4773], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6208, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6175, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"/en/op3ncare-community-groupnode/openvillage-main#welcome\">OpenVillage Festival mainpage</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<em>This is a collaborative wiki.

A group of researchers, some of which I even know personally and collaborated with, had discovered [impressive empirical regularities in how cities scale](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/17/7301.long). The gist of it is: every human city, across time, space and culture, is a scaled-up (or -down) version of every other city. But such scaling is non-linear: it follows power laws.\n\n* Infrastructure requirements scales sublinearly to city size, as measured by the number of inhabitants. The exponent of the scaling function is 0.85. As you increase the number of a city's inhabitants by 100%, it only needs 85% more kilometers of cables, cellphone masts, etc.  \n* Social and economic indicators scale superlinearly to city size. The exponent of the scaling function is 1.15. As you increase the number of a city's inhabitants by 100%, its GDP, number of patents, crime rate etc. increase by 115%. \n\nThese two phenomena drive the increasing dominance of cities. The size and cost of the support systems  needed to support a human live is smallest in the biggest cities. This means cities are a powerful green technology, [as argued by Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Discipline). Also, large cities are conducive to more, faster innovation, and the \"buzz\" and excitement that city dwellers love so well. \n\nWe even know why this happens. Economies of scale in life support are driven by something called hierarchical branching networks. I won't venture in an explanation about this. If you are curious, read Geoffrey Wests's _Scale_. It's great, superclear and a lot of fun. I want, instead, to take a closer look as why social and economic indicators scale the way they do.\n\nIt has to do with social networks. Social networks scale \"in reverse\". Think of a sublinearly-scaling network like an aqueduct. It has a very big \"master pipe\" leaving the reservoir of drinkable water. This forks several times into smaller pipes, until it gets to the terminal size good for serving your apartment. Your social network, is not shaped that way. You have strong ties to people closest to you, also in the physical sense. But you also have weaker ties, and those travel farther. For example, they might reach a former classmate who now lives in a different county. \n\nThese ties are cheaper to maintain, because you do not talk to these people as much as to your closest friends. But they are also liable to create the most opportunities to you: a new idea, a job opening you did not know about, an interesting book or film. [People are more likely to find a new job through distant acquaintances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Granovetter#The_strength_of_weak_ties) than through close friends. In cities, it is easiest to build low-maintenance, high-potential, long-distance weak ties. And the longer-distance the tie, the higher its potential for novelty and cross-pollination. The flow of ideas feeds on diversity. Unlike with water systems, here thinner, weaker \"pipes\" (social ties) transport _more_ innovation and opportunities.\n\nThis is fascinating stuff, and I plan to go _much_ deeper into it. It also has implications for our own plans with building Edgeryders settlements.\n\n### The meta-city\n\nThe whole settlement operation grew out of Edgeryders itself. The edgeryders.eu platform is the main connecting layer for our community. We tend to use it in a focused way: no cute cats, celebrities or ranting about politics here. Almost 100% you'll read is people comparing notes, as they try to reinvent their own life and work as part of some kind of societal change. And almost 100% of these conversations are long-distance. This is because reinvention and change can be lonely. If you are trying to [reinvent the home](https://edgeryders.eu/t/spawning-the-reef-brussels-re-inventing-communal-working-and-living-again/6239), or [pushing for social innovation in war-torn zones](https://edgeryders.eu/t/update-from-no-mans-land/8130/1), chances are you are the _only_ person in your local context doing those things \u2013 unless you live in a major city. You are going to need someone to talk to, learn from, check in with. On Edgeryders you can find them, and interact with them in a distraction-free environment. \n\nSo, online spaces like Edgeryders provide weak, low-maintenance, long-distance social ties. Exactly the kind of social ties that make cities so innovative. If Geoff West, Lu\u00eds Bettencourt and the other complex systems urban scholars are right, _those ties are what a city is_. Except, in our case, they span many contexts, urban and non-urban. If you visualize cities as the branches of a Christmas tree, these social ties are like festoons. They connect people on _different_ branches, whereas city life connects people on the _same_ branch. **We are a kind of meta-city**. \n\n###Two strategies for settlements\n\nThere might be a way to test for structural similarity of Edgeryders-style weak ties to city-style ones. I have not looked into it yet. But let's assume, for the sake of the argument, that the meta-city intuition holds true. Then what? What does that have to say about the way we set up spaces to live and work in?\n\nThere is one straightforward implication. This: **invest in \"city-like\" weak, long-distance, low maintenance social ties**, especially if you don't live in a major city. \n\nIn practice, people in Edgeryders are building two very different kinds of settlements. Let's call them \"rural\" and \"urban\". Both provide affordable living  and working space for project- and small business development. But they do so with different strategies. So, investment in weak ties means different things in different kinds of spaces.\n\n\"Rural\" settlements, like [the one in Sidi Kaouki](https://edgeryders.eu/t/moving-in-to-openvillage-house-sidi-kaouki/7961), offer cheap space in a context of natural beauty. They strive for relative self-sufficiency and a low carbon footprint. This sounds great, and it is, but there is a price to pay: relative isolation. Their world will be small, unless they make constant efforts to enlarge it. \n\n\"Urban\" Edgeryders settlements, like [The Reef in  Brussels](https://edgeryders.eu/t/spawning-the-reef-brussels-re-inventing-communal-working-and-living-again/6239), offer affordable space and an edgy culture applied to work and business. They strive for sustainability by making the most of what the city offers (public transport, farmers markets etc.). They use their central position to connect to opportunities, and share them across the network. \n\nFor rural settlements, investing in weak ties means two things.\n\nFirst: make your place attractive, and be generous with your hospitality. It's the analogue of the vow of stability Benedictine monks made. Someone must love the place enough to stay with it, and welcome others who might help.\n\nAnd second: pay a lot of attention to your online presence. You are going to need the long-distance ties that it affords. Documenting your own efforts goes a long way to put you on the map.  @matthias's [optical coffee sorter](https://edgeryders.eu/t/open-source-optical-coffee-sorter/7122/15), for example, attracted the right kind of attention. Not \"go viral\", which would be a distraction, but about ten skilled people willing to contribute. This would be a sort of \"vow of connectivity\": being open to the world and building new social ties from a remote, rural place.\n\nUrban settlements already come with weak ties. Despite this, paying attention to their online presence is a good idea. They are already in one city, but they can and should partake of the meta-city too. Participating in Edgeryders (or other online communities like it) gives them that kind of access. But there is another move they can make. They can position themselves where they can bridge what Ronald Burt calls [structural holes](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_holes) in the city's social network. The best candidates for this are at the border of poorer neighbourhoods. There, our settlements can connect  people at the edge of urban life to the centers of power. This will make it easier for the settlement to stay affordable. At the same time, it will generate positive externalities and opportunities for our neighbours. \n\nI may be off the mark here. I realize this is all sketchy and conditional. The general point is not that I have found a perfect model for Edgeryders settlements.

It would require to create some ideas and insights on the fly that at least sounded somehow interesting or relevant. Bit like brainstorming on stage :D I still remember an idea I had in this situation, which felt novel to me: \"Open source is about re-inventing and re-creating everything that so far only exists in IP protected, closed versions. It's somehow a waste of time enforced by the laws we have, but so be it.\"\n\nAs for changes, I'd propose to somehow give curator teams quite some time (30 min) to discuss their insights together before telling the audience.

Mieszkam w tym samym mie\u015bcie od urodzenia - w domu, kt\u00f3ry nale\u017ca\u0142 do moich dziadk\u00f3w, wi\u0119c jestem do\u015b\u0107 uprzywilejowany. Chocia\u017c chyba nie pochodz\u0119 z rodziny inteligenckiej. Moja mama mia\u0142a niepe\u0142ne wykszta\u0142cenie wy\u017csze, a tata - zawodowe. Ksi\u0105\u017cek w moim domu by\u0142o oko\u0142o 200. Zacz\u0105\u0142em by\u0107 aktywny na studiach - od 2005 roku. Najpierw zacz\u0105\u0142em dzia\u0142a\u0107 w kole naukowym biolog\u00f3w, p\u00f3\u017aniej w studenckim kole naukowym filozof\u00f3w kultury. Chodzi\u0142em do liceum prywatnego, w kt\u00f3rym by\u0142a filozofia. Dlatego ko\u0142o filozof\u00f3w nie by\u0142o mi obce. Wiedzia\u0142em czego si\u0119 spodziewa\u0107. By\u0142em wsp\u00f3\u0142za\u0142o\u017cycielem ko\u0142a naukowego informacji naukowej. Chyba te\u017c na studiach zacz\u0105\u0142em obserwowa\u0107 samorz\u0105d. Nie mam poj\u0119cia sk\u0105d to si\u0119 wzi\u0119\u0142o, bo w mojej rodzinie nikt nie interesowa\u0142 si\u0119 polityk\u0105 ani samorz\u0105dem. Dopiero teraz, gdy dzia\u0142am, moja rodzina patrzy na to troch\u0119 jak na wybryk, taki nieracjonalny; kiedy przynosz\u0119 do domu naukowe informacje, np.: \u017ceby nie kosi\u0107 trawy, bo to jest dobre, reaguj z wielkim oporem. Moja siostra patrzy na to moje dzia\u0142anie jak na hobby. Ma podobne pogl\u0105dy do moich, wi\u0119c mo\u017cemy podyskutowa\u0107, w niej znajduj\u0119 zrozumienie. Nie by\u0142o w mojej rodzinie wzorc\u00f3w bycia aktywnym: nikt nie by\u0142 nigdy w \u017cadnym stowarzyszeniu. Dziadek by\u0142 kierownikiem w lubelskim m\u0142ynie, ale nie wiem czy dzia\u0142a\u0142 w partii. Chyba tak, skoro w tamtych czasach by\u0142 na takim stanowisku. Od dziadka wynios\u0142em, \u017ce trzeba g\u0142osowa\u0107. Gdy jest mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 wzi\u0119cia udzia\u0142u w wyborach, trzeba g\u0142osowa\u0107. W swoim \u017cyciu tylko raz odda\u0142em g\u0142os niewa\u017cny. Wtedy chcia\u0142em wzi\u0105\u0107 udzia\u0142 w wyborach, ale wyb\u00f3r by\u0142 ja\u0142owy: mi\u0119dzy d\u017cum\u0105 a choler\u0105. Podejrzewam, \u017ce to mog\u0142o by\u0107 w wyborach prezydenckich pomi\u0119dzy Komorowskim a Dud\u0105. Je\u015bli kto\u015b m\u00f3wi zmie\u0144 prac\u0119, we\u017a kredyt, wiadomo, \u017ce takiej osoby nie mo\u017cna poprze\u0107. A kandydat PIS te\u017c nie by\u0142 mi bliski.\n\nNajbardziej intensywny okres, w kt\u00f3rym zosta\u0142em ukierunkowany, przypada\u0142o na liceum: katolickie i wojskowe. Tam powszechn\u0105 i akceptowaln\u0105 ideologi\u0105 by\u0142a opcja Platformy Obywatelskiej. Otwarcie m\u00f3wiono, \u017ce g\u0142osuje si\u0119 na Platform\u0119. Jeden z nauczycieli by\u0142 z M\u0142odych Demokrat\u00f3w, czyli m\u0142odzie\u017c\u00f3wki Platformy. On mi imponowa\u0142. Ca\u0142y czas go ceni\u0119. Wiem, \u017ce nadal dzia\u0142a. Teraz jest korespondentem, chyba z Ukrainy. Moje pogl\u0105dy ewoluowa\u0142y przez ten czas. Kolega z Ruchu Miejskiego te\u017c chodzi\u0142 do tego liceum i zapyta\u0142 jak to mo\u017cliwe, \u017ce obaj mamy takie pogl\u0105dy po tym liceum. Wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 naszych znajomych wysz\u0142a stamt\u0105d z konserwatywnymi pogl\u0105dami, a lewicowe by\u0142y w mniejszo\u015bci. Podobnie jest w moim otoczeniu: osoby wra\u017cliwe spo\u0142ecznie czy lewica to jednak mniejszo\u015b\u0107. Najliczniejsza grupa w moim otoczeniu jest liberalno \u2013 prawicowa. To czasem boli, ale jestem z nimi z\u017cyty. Traktuj\u0119 to jako poznawanie pogl\u0105d\u00f3w innych ni\u017c w\u0142asne. Nie wykluczam ich przez pogl\u0105dy. Oni te\u017c pozwalaj\u0105 mi pozna\u0107 pogl\u0105dy innych ludzi, kt\u00f3re mog\u0105 by\u0107 typowymi u wi\u0119kszo\u015bci Polak\u00f3w. Spotykam si\u0119 z nietolerancj\u0105, rasizmem, ksenofobi\u0105, kt\u00f3ra wynika z niewiedzy, co jest przykre. Pomimo wyjazd\u00f3w na zach\u00f3d ci moi znajomi przesi\u0105kali jednak tymi negatywnymi wzorcami. Dlaczego? Jechali tylko zarobkowo, g\u0142\u00f3wnie do swoich znajomych, co wbrew pozorom nie wp\u0142ywa\u0142o na styczno\u015b\u0107 z innymi osobami, tylko przede wszystkim ze swoimi odpowiednikami ideologicznymi. B\u0119d\u0105c w enklawach robotniczych poza miastami nie byli w stanie do\u015bwiadczy\u0107 czego\u015b innego.\n\nZacz\u0105\u0142em dzia\u0142a\u0107 w 2008 roku w akcjach rowerowych. W 2007/2008 roku by\u0142em kurierem rowerowym. Znajomy pokaza\u0142 mi wegetaria\u0144sk\u0105 knajp\u0119. Zobaczy\u0142em to po raz pierwszy. To by\u0142o co\u015b innego. Potem pozna\u0142em na alleycatach aktywist\u00f3w spo\u0142ecznych i gdzie\u015b tutaj si\u0119 to zacz\u0119\u0142o. Od 10 lat prowadz\u0119 grup\u0119 dzielnicow\u0105 na facebooku, od 9 lat stron\u0119 internetow\u0105, a wcze\u015bniej bloga. Wtedy ju\u017c czyta\u0142em co si\u0119 dzieje w Lublinie. W liceum by\u0142a presja bycia na bie\u017c\u0105co, trzeba by\u0142o kupowa\u0107 gazet\u0119 na wiedz\u0119 o spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwie, raz p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107 do filharmonii czy trzy razy na wystaw\u0119, \u017ceby zaliczy\u0107 plastyk\u0119 albo muzyk\u0119. Od 2009 roku chodz\u0119 jako obserwator regularnie na posiedzenia rady dzielnicy. W jednej z kadencji otrzyma\u0142em od \u00f3wczesnego przewodnicz\u0105cego rady dzielnicy przewodnik po mie\u015bcie Lublin z dedykacj\u0105 dla sta\u0142ego go\u015bcia posiedze\u0144. Trzy razy kandydowa\u0142em do rady dzielnicy i dopiero za trzecim si\u0119 uda\u0142o. Po jakim\u015b czasie zrozumia\u0142em, \u017ce absolutnie nie mo\u017cna dzia\u0142a\u0107 samodzielnie. To m\u00f3wi\u0119 osobom, kt\u00f3re pytaj\u0105 mnie jak si\u0119 zaanga\u017cowa\u0107 w sprawy dla siebie wa\u017cne. Nie mo\u017cesz dzia\u0142a\u0107 sam, bo si\u0119 wypalisz, bo si\u0119 zm\u0119czysz. Dopiero jak wszed\u0142em we wsp\u00f3\u0142prac\u0119 z innymi osobami z dzielnicy - drukowali\u015bmy razem plakaty, ulotki \u2013 dopiero wtedy uda\u0142o mi si\u0119 dosta\u0107 do rady dzielnicy. Ciesz\u0119 si\u0119, \u017ce na ostatnim posiedzeniu rady dzielnicy mog\u0142em wspomnie\u0107 o czym\u015b takim jak skrzy\u017cowania kopenhaskie, staram si\u0119 pilnowa\u0107, \u017ceby przestrzegano zarz\u0105dzenia prezydenta miasta o standardach pieszych, i edukowa\u0107 radnych oraz radne. Prosz\u0119 \u017ceby\u015bmy to dopisywali w uchwa\u0142ach rady dzielnicy, bo w Lublinie nie przestrzega si\u0119 zarz\u0105dze\u0144 prezydenta miasta. \n\nMam troch\u0119 negatywny obraz Lublina. Chocia\u017c ostatnio zauwa\u017cy\u0142em co\u015b pozytywnego, np.: \u017ce wzrasta liczba os\u00f3b zaanga\u017cowanych spo\u0142ecznie. Przyk\u0142adem s\u0105 G\u00f3rki Czechowskie. W tym sporze nie chodzi tylko o ziele\u0144 w mie\u015bcie, ale te\u017c o szacunek do mieszka\u0144c\u00f3w i honor, o twarz, o prawdom\u00f3wno\u015b\u0107. Mamy w tym ruchu miejskim grupy nieformalne, kt\u00f3re pokazuj\u0105, \u017ce nie tylko dziej\u0105 si\u0119 z\u0142e rzeczy, ale one daj\u0105 na to recept\u0119. Nie ma woli politycznej, ale my, jako strona spo\u0142eczna, liczniej staramy si\u0119 naciska\u0107 na miasto. Zaanga\u017cowa\u0142em si\u0119 w ruch obrony lokalnego du\u017cego terenu zielonego, bo to dla mnie przyk\u0142ad buty, arogancji, ob\u0142udy, oderwania od rzeczywisto\u015bci lokalnej w\u0142adzy. To dla mnie przyk\u0142ad, \u017ce mieszka\u0144c\u00f3w si\u0119 ok\u0142amuje i poniewiera, urz\u0105d nie wype\u0142nia swoich obowi\u0105zk\u00f3w, bo np.: na stronie interentowej po\u015bwi\u0119conej referendum nie zamie\u015bci\u0142 wszystkich dokument\u00f3w, w kt\u00f3rych posiadaniu by\u0142. Nie informowa\u0142 rzetelnie o sytuacji. Chcia\u0142bym, \u017ceby Lublin by\u0142 zielony, a G\u00f3rki Czechowskie s\u0105 wa\u017cnym elementem walki ze smogiem. Odczuwam problemy zwi\u0105zane ze smogiem, je\u017cd\u017c\u0119 w masce przeciwsmogowej, mam sw\u00f3j czujnik zapylenia powietrza. U\u017cywam maski, gdy zapylenie przekracza \u015bwiatowe \u2013 nie polskie - normy. Czytam od dawna o tym jak tworzy\u0107 miasta przyjazne dla ludzi. St\u0105d wiem wi\u0119cej jak dzia\u0142a to miasto i widz\u0119, \u017ce jest \u017ale. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce wiem jak mog\u0142oby by\u0107 lepiej. Czasem to s\u0142omiany zapa\u0142. W niekt\u00f3rych inicjatywach jestem kr\u00f3tko, gdy nie widz\u0119 u siebie energii do dzia\u0142ania. Staram si\u0119 nie wypruwa\u0107 sobie flak\u00f3w, dba\u0107 o sw\u00f3j czas, na odpoczynek dla siebie, znajomych czy rodziny. Sam nie zbawi\u0119 \u015bwiata. Jest czas pracy, jest czas odpoczynku. Trzeba mie\u0107 w tym balans. Nawet z kr\u00f3tkich inicjatyw zbieram do\u015bwiadczenia. Powinienem, chcia\u0142bym, pozna\u0107 r\u00f3\u017cnych ludzi i sytuacje. Gdy id\u0119 wesprze\u0107 strajk nauczycieli, s\u0142ysz\u0119 tylko przekaz telewizji \u201cre\u017cimowej\u201d. Podobnie by\u0142o w akcji lokatorskiej. Bardzo ma\u0142o os\u00f3b w moim otoczeniu roumia\u0142o ten problem. Traktuj\u0119 to jako samoedukacj\u0119. Bycie blisko tych grup daje bardzo du\u017co informacji. Mog\u0119 dowiedzie\u0107 si\u0119 jak to jest naprawd\u0119. To, co wiem o mie\u015bcie, zawdzi\u0119czam w du\u017cej mierze Forum Kultury Przestrzeni, kt\u00f3re organizowa\u0142o wiele spotka\u0144 eksperckich. Wielokrotnie zaprasza\u0142em radnych dzielnicy na te spotkania, ale nigdy nikogo z nich tam nie widzia\u0142em. W tej radzie dzielnicy rozes\u0142a\u0142em maila z wyliczeniem organizacji w Lublinie dzia\u0142aj\u0105cych na rzecz poprawy stanu naszego miasta. Na razie nie ma odzewu, ale nie mo\u017cna liczy\u0107, \u017ce po jednym razie zacz\u0105 wchodzi\u0107 na strony i je obserwowa\u0107. Widz\u0119, \u017ce na grup\u0119 dzielnicow\u0105 wchodz\u0105 cz\u0119\u015bciej (jest tam teraz ok. 5 000 os\u00f3b). Wrzucam na ni\u0105 te\u017c materia\u0142y edukacyjne, ostatnio o tym dlaczego drzewa w mie\u015bcie s\u0105 wa\u017cne. Nie zawsze spotykam si\u0119 ze zrozumieniem, ale s\u0105 te\u017c sojusznicy popieraj\u0105cy ide\u0119 miasta przyjaznego mieszka\u0144com.  My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce to proces. Na razie jak wrzuc\u0119 materia\u0142y, to chocia\u017c przemknie im to przed oczami. To ju\u017c jest co\u015b. Za kolejnym razem mo\u017ce to si\u0119 utrwali. Przynajmniej \u015bwiadomo\u015b\u0107 mieszka\u0144c\u00f3w wzro\u015bnie. \n\nJako ruch miejski startowali\u015bmy w wyborach i nasza aktywno\u015b\u0107 troch\u0119 jest, a troch\u0119 jej nie ma. Ostatnio, gdy by\u0142 protest dotycz\u0105cy G\u00f3rek Czechowskich, przedstawi\u0142em si\u0119 jako Lubelski Ruch Miejski. Wola\u0142bym si\u0119 przedstawi\u0107 jako Partia Razem, ale wiem, \u017ce to by\u0142oby mniej akceptowalne. Czuj\u0119, \u017ce nie jest to mile widziane ze strony spo\u0142ecznej, \u017ceby przedstawi\u0107 si\u0119 jako cz\u0142onek partii. Ludzie chc\u0105 by\u0107 apolityczni. Ruch miejski jest w budowie, w powijakach. Poznali\u015bmy si\u0119 nawzajem w Lublinie, ale to jest daleki pocz\u0105tek. Chcieli\u015bmy, \u017ceby to by\u0142 parasol wsp\u00f3\u0142pracy r\u00f3\u017cnych organizacji, i to si\u0119 udaje w przypadku G\u00f3rkach Czechowskich. Nie by\u0142o innego tematu w ruchu, kt\u00f3ry scali\u0142by r\u00f3\u017cne \u015brodowiska. Ruch miejski b\u0119dzie organizmem \u017cywym, je\u015bli na jak\u0105\u015b akcj\u0119 zmobilizuje r\u00f3\u017cne organizacje. Chcia\u0142bym, \u017ceby\u015bmy wspierali si\u0119 w przekrojowych obszarach: np.: na eksmisj\u0119 przyjd\u0105 aktywi\u015bci G\u00f3rek Czechowskich i rowerzy\u015bci, a na protest o G\u00f3rkach przyjd\u0105 chocia\u017c ludzie z akcji lokatorskiej. \n\nJestem w Partii Razem od 4 lat - od momentu powstania. Obserwowanie polityki lokalnej sk\u0142oni\u0142o mnie do refleksji, \u017ce zmiana mo\u017ce przyj\u015b\u0107 tylko w wyniku dzia\u0142ania partii politycznej. Dzia\u0142ania NGOs przynosz\u0105 efekt, ale czasem, bywa dora\u017any, na ma\u0142\u0105 skal\u0119, a skuteczn\u0105 zmian\u0119 wprowadzi tylko partia polityczna. NGOs nie maj\u0105 tej si\u0142y. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce w Polsce tak dzia\u0142\u0105 ten system. Przed powstaniem Partii Razem mia\u0142em sprecyzowane pogl\u0105dy, ale nie by\u0142o partii dla mnie. To pierwsza partia polityczna, z kt\u00f3r\u0105 mog\u0119 si\u0119 zgodzi\u0107 w 80%. Obecno\u015b\u0107 w Partii te\u017c traktuj\u0119 edukacyjnie. Da\u0142a mi szkolenia i warsztaty na wysokim poziomie. Da\u0142a mi du\u017co wiedzy: jak m\u00f3wi\u0107 na konferencjach, jak prowadzi\u0107 social media itd. Bardzo to by\u0142o cenne. Zyska\u0142em pewno\u015b\u0107 siebie dzi\u0119ki temu. Lubelski Ruch Miejski mo\u017ce by\u0107 bardziej aktywny ni\u017c Partia Razem w tym momencie, co wynika z brak\u00f3w kadrowych i cech charakterologicznych. W ruchu miejskim jest mniej os\u00f3b, ale one s\u0105 z innym spojrzeniem. W Partii Razem mamy problem z nap\u0142ywem nowych os\u00f3b i tzw. lokomotyw. \n\nOsobi\u015bcie mam problem, \u017ceby okre\u015bli\u0107 co chc\u0119 robi\u0107. Teraz jestem radnym dzielnicy i sekretarzem, przewodnicz\u0105cym klubu sportowego Bike Polo Lublin, prowadz\u0119 grup\u0119 dzielnicow\u0105 na facebooku, dzia\u0142am w partii politycznej. \u017badna z tych rzeczy nie jest bardzo absorbuj\u0105ca, ale ka\u017cda po trosze tak. I nie wiem z czego chcia\u0142bym zrezygnowa\u0107. Nie czuj\u0119 si\u0119 jako cz\u0142owiek w pierwszym szeregu. Jestem wykonawc\u0105, mog\u0119 organizowa\u0107. Lepiej czuj\u0119 si\u0119 w drugim szeregu. Jestem politykiem i aktywist\u0105. Jestem politykiem, bo startowa\u0142em w wyborach, jestem cz\u0142onkiem partii, a aktywist\u0105, bo cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 rzeczy robi\u0119 w czasie wolnym nieodp\u0142atnie, dla idei, dla dobra spo\u0142ecznego, poza systemem partyjnym. A mo\u017ce troch\u0119 przestaj\u0119 by\u0107 aktywist\u0105, chocia\u017c bike polo nigdy nie b\u0119dzie polityczne. Koledzy te\u017c na to nie pozwol\u0105. Byli oburzeni, \u017ce mam naklejki partyjne na ko\u0142ach. Wymusili na mnie, \u017cebym je zakry\u0142. Rozumiem, bo oni nie s\u0105 aktywistami, politykami. maj\u0105 stereotypowe poj\u0119cie o polityce. Ich reakcja by\u0142a typowa. Dop\u00f3ki dzia\u0142am w bike polo, b\u0119d\u0119 aktywist\u0105. Tu te\u017c mamy problem z pozyskaniem ludzi. Mamy infrastruktur\u0119, ale nie gramy, bo nie mamy z kim. R\u00f3\u017cne sposoby dotarcia do nowych graczy nie przynosz\u0105 efektu. Nic nie dzia\u0142a. Mamy instagram, media spo\u0142eczno\u015bciowe, rozmawiamy z lud\u017ami. To jest problem Lublina. Wiemy, \u017ce inne grupy sportowe te\u017c maj\u0105 z tym problem. \n\nB\u0119d\u0119 kandydowa\u0142 w wyborach parlamentarnych. Mamy za ma\u0142o os\u00f3b. Przera\u017ca mnie zbieranie podpis\u00f3w w naszym okr\u0119gu. To jest tak wyka\u0144czaj\u0105ce... To tak jakby\u015b mia\u0142a eksmisj\u0119 trzy razy w tygodniu przez miesi\u0105c. Zauwa\u017cy\u0142em w wyborach do europarlamentu, \u017ce z Polakami jest coraz gorzej. Ludzie boj\u0105 si\u0119 o swoje dane typu PESEL, a teraz nawet nie chcieli bra\u0107 ulotek. Wed\u0142ug bada\u0144 70-80% Polak\u00f3w chcia\u0142oby wymieni\u0107 obecnie rz\u0105dz\u0105cych, ale nikt nie chce wzi\u0105\u0107 ulotki od nowej osoby w polityce. Du\u017ce partie maj\u0105 zaplecze ludzi do zbierania podpis\u00f3w, a \u017ceby wej\u015b\u0107 do polityki jest pr\u00f3g wej\u015bcia \u2013 op\u00f3r spo\u0142eczny. Chcia\u0142bym zmiany spo\u0142ecznej i zmiany polityk\u00f3w, ale nic nie zrobi\u0119. Ludzie s\u0105 bierni i zamkni\u0119ci. To jest teraz najtrudniejsze w dzia\u0142aniach. Zawsze mam ulotki rowerowe. Gdy widz\u0119 nietypowy rower, stereotypowo my\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce to jest kto\u015b, kto czego\u015b szuka. Wk\u0142adam ulotk\u0119 w rower tak, \u017ce nie da si\u0119 jej nie znale\u017a\u0107. Nigdy nikt nie przyjecha\u0142 z takiej ulotki. Ostatni raz dwie obce osoby przysz\u0142y do nas na trening rok temu, z czego zosta\u0142a jedna. \n\nJedyna konsekwencja czy minus dzia\u0142alno\u015bci jest taki, \u017ce zu\u017cywam energi\u0119. Czasem jak rozdaj\u0119 ulotki, kto\u015b mnie zwyzywa. Ale tu akurat winni s\u0105 ludzie, kt\u00f3rzy rzucaj\u0105 wyzwiska\u0105, a nie dzia\u0142ania, jakie podejmuj\u0119. Dlaczego to robi\u0119? Dla mnie to jest imperatyw. W pracy m\u00f3wi\u0105 mi czasem, \u017ce znowu by\u0142em w telewizji, a w domy\u015ble \u2013 ironicznie - \u017ce pcham si\u0119 do koryta. Wpadaj\u0105 mi czasem my\u015bli o emigracji. Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce przez jaki\u015b czas by\u0142bym anonimowym obywatelem, a potem zacz\u0105\u0142bym I tak dzia\u0142a\u0107. To jest takie \u201cja\u201d. Po prostu to robi\u0119. Anga\u017cuj\u0119 si\u0119 najbardziej tam, gdzie widz\u0119 szans\u0119 na zmian\u0119, To mnie nap\u0119dza. Dop\u00f3ki mam balans, \u017ce nie wypruwam sobie flak\u00f3w \u2013 dzia\u0142am. Wierz\u0119 w to, co robi\u0119, nie widz\u0119 negatywnych rzeczy. \nProgram Partii Razem jest spo\u0142eczny, inkluzywny, chce pom\u00f3c najs\u0142abszym cz\u0142onkom spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa. Podobnie jak PIS. PIS wychodzi mi jako druga bliska opcja polityczna w tzw. latarnikach wyborczych. Ale opr\u00f3cz programu jest jeszcze spos\u00f3b, metody, poziom cywilizacyjny, szacunek. Cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 os\u00f3b z Razem jest dla mnie inspiracj\u0105, wzorem. To osoby, kt\u00f3re pokazuj\u0105 mi, \u017ce to jest dobra opcja. Znam z PISu jedn\u0105 osob\u0119, radnego, kt\u00f3rego bardzo szanuj\u0119. Jest najlepszym samorz\u0105dowcem, jakiego znam. Odwracam g\u0142ow\u0119, gdy g\u0142osuje za jakim\u015b listem w intencji Maryi. Tego cz\u0142owieka szanuj\u0119 za jego dzia\u0142ania. Razem to dla mnie ca\u0142y czas nadzieja. Ma szerszy program spo\u0142eczny. PIS ma pewnie w programie du\u017co rzeczy, cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 z nich wprowadza, najbardziej oddzia\u0142uj\u0105ce, ale to nawet nie jest malutka cz\u0119\u015b\u0107. Dla mnie wa\u017cny jest zr\u00f3wnowa\u017cony transport i bezpiecze\u0144stwo, z czym PIS nic nie robi. Razem daje mi wsp\u00f3lnotowo\u015b\u0107 warto\u015bci. Nie wyobra\u017cam sobie bycia w PIS. Jestem apostat\u0105, nie mog\u0119 by\u0107 w partii wspieraj\u0105cej korporacj\u0119 ko\u015bcieln\u0105. Je\u015bli chodzi o religi\u0119, nie mia\u0142em wzoru w domu \u2013 wierz\u0105cy, ale niepraktykuj\u0105cy, to by\u0142 m\u00f3j start. By\u0142em wysy\u0142any do ko\u015bcio\u0142a ze starszym bratem, ale tam nie dociera\u0142em. W liceum religia przesta\u0142a by\u0107 czymkolwiek dla mnie. Pozna\u0142em wtedy deizm i agnostycyzm. Dzi\u0119ki filozofii pozna\u0142em inne sposoby my\u015blenia. Zacz\u0105\u0142em czyta\u0107 na ten temat, a na studiach wypisa\u0142em si\u0119 z ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Nie chc\u0119 by\u0107 w organizacji, do kt\u00f3rej mnie przymusowo zapisano. Chodzi\u0142em z moimi partnerkami do ko\u015bcio\u0142a, ale tylko sta\u0142em, nie bra\u0142em aktywnie udzia\u0142u. Czy duchowo\u015b\u0107 jest mi potrzebna? Jedynie mo\u017ce prze\u017cywam cudowno\u015b\u0107 natury. Mam momenty zachwytu nad przyrod\u0105. Szukam jej te\u017c w swoich dzia\u0142aniach. Nie wiem czy mo\u017cna by\u0107 cz\u0142owiekiem i nie mie\u0107 sfery duchowej. Muzyka jest te\u017c dla mnie prze\u017cyciem duchowym. Nie mam \u017cadnych b\u00f3stw. Jako deista by\u0142em w ch\u00f3rze archikatedry, ale zrezygnowa\u0142em, bo nie mog\u0142em s\u0142ucha\u0107 na \u017cywo kaza\u0144 arcybiskupa \u017byci\u0144skiego. Mog\u0142em go czyta\u0107, ale nie s\u0142ucha\u0107 na \u017cywo. Nie znosi\u0142em jego g\u0142osu. To, co chcia\u0142bym w sobie rozwin\u0105\u0107 to sfera duchowa: \u201czatrzymaj si\u0119\u201d, \u201cpomy\u015bl\u201d. Ca\u0142y czas mam wra\u017cenie, \u017ce nie umiem odpoczywa\u0107; \u017ce nie robi\u0119 rzeczy, kt\u00f3re daj\u0105 odpoczynek. Ci\u0119\u017cko zje\u015b\u0107 mi \u015bniadanie bez telefonu w r\u0119ku. Ale robi\u0119 te\u017c co\u015b przy kwiatach, bo to lubi\u0119, co\u015b nieobci\u0105\u017caj\u0105cego. Umiej\u0119tno\u015b\u0107 odpoczywania powinno si\u0119 kszta\u0142ci\u0107 u ludzi. \n\nW wyborach samorz\u0105dowych startuj\u0119, bo chc\u0119, w parlamentarnych - bo nie mamy ludzi. Moje kompetencje s\u0105 odpowiednie dla samorz\u0105dowca. W tym czuj\u0119 si\u0119 dobrze. Chcia\u0142em mie\u0107 lepszy wynik, ale taki nie by\u0142. Czasem mnie to frustruje, \u017ce po\u015bwi\u0119cam sw\u00f3j czas, buduj\u0119 rozpoznawalno\u015b\u0107 przez prowadzenie grupy dzielnicowej na facebooku, za co te\u017c kto\u015b mnie obra\u017ca personalnie. Uwa\u017cam te\u017c, \u017ce m\u0142odych ludzi powinno si\u0119 edukowa\u0107 do dzia\u0142ania. Chcia\u0142em w swoje dzia\u0142ania w\u0142\u0105cza\u0107 nowe osoby, ale boj\u0119 si\u0119 odda\u0107 facebooka z pot\u0119\u017cn\u0105 grup\u0105 odbiorc\u00f3w, bo nie mam na tyle zaufania, \u017ceby to faktycznie odda\u0107. My\u015bl\u0119 o zrobieniu zlotu grupy dzielnicowej, ale si\u0119 boj\u0119, \u017ce nie dam rady i nie mam wystarczaj\u0105cych umiej\u0119tno\u015bci interpersonalnych, organizacyjnych, kontakt\u00f3w itd. Moja dzielnica (pi\u0105ta pod wzgl\u0119dem wielko\u015bci w mie\u015bcie) jest pierwsza w g\u0142osowaniu na bycie miejscem wydarze\u0144 podczas Carnavalu Sztuk - Mistrz\u00f3w w dzielnicach.

Basically the only beautiful Gantt charts I saw, but I can't try it for lack of MS Office. For an online solution with at least somewhat beautiful Gantt charts, see <a href=\"https://blog.vizzlo.com/introducing-vizzlos-project-management-charts-20599bf27af4\">Vizzlo</a>.

Quite beautiful output, and (what is quite astonishing), the resulting PDFs can be edited with Inkscape very well to beautify the output further. If we want to use it right now, we'd use their free SaaS. The JavaScript component is open source software though (<a href=\"https://github.com/robicch/jQueryGantt\">repo</a>), so we could later make it into a fully collaborative application on our server with 2-3 days of effort, by adding a Ruby-based server side application for storing, importing and exporting the data. For data migration to that, there is a hack: call `saveGanttOnServer()` in the developer tools' JavaScript console of the Twproject Gantt SaaS application and copy out the JSON of the resulting HTTP POST query generated by this.

Hundreds of thousands are protesting against the current islamist government. Much of the economic activity is frozen or moves very slowly. All the problems that already existed have just accumulated, since not many people work any more. The FDIs are at a very low level and many foreign investors are leaving the country. Unemployment is high, especially among the youth. In a bid to ease the tensions and to push the economic wheels I would like to launch a project of the type of the UnMonastery in Cairo.\n\n<strong>Needs:</strong>\n\nThe anger and the energy of the young people should be canalized into something positive and much needed reconstruction of the economy and the infrastructure of the society. Egypt is in a urgent need to get the economic wheels turning again and to handle some pressing issues on waste management, electricity shortage and water supply.\n\n<strong>Assignment:</strong>\n\nTo canalize some of the energy from the protests and civil unrest into much needed positive projects to solve some of the most pressing issues.\n\nWhat I would need is a proposal in the form of 3 slides\u00a0that I can present while at the meeting.

In anthropology, direct collection is interviews: they need consent. Indirect collection is Twitter mining: it does not need consent. But it does need information to the Twitter users, _unless_ the data are for for research _and_ it is \"unreasonably burdensome\" to inform every single user. A nice discussion on what a \"reasonable effort\" is follows. For example, in projects where data is collected from Facebook groups Anders writes to group admins and asks them for their opinion, and then posts on the group informing members about the study.\n* It's also super-important to be able to say whether the data are self-published. If they are, no consent is needed. This covers blog posts etc. \n* Data security requirements always apply.  But in practice you can be sued for the consequences of data breach. The consequences of Edgeryders suffering a data breach on email addresses are, in practice, unlikely to cause any major damage. \n\nSome cases:\n\n* Facebook profiles are not callable through APIs. Maybe we should not consider this as a public data source. If we do not, we need informed consent. However, a court in Denmark has sentenced that iff you have over 400 friends, you cannot reasonably expect your posts to stay private, even if you restrict them to \"friends only\".\n* Facebook's closed and secret groups are also not callable through APIs. Again, you can use API permission as a criterion for data being public. This would arguably exceed the GDPR's requirements. \n\nEdgeryders is a bit different from TANT-Lab in that we actually DO ask for consent. Our story is:\n\n1. Edgeryders is a collective blog. We are publishing text, and collecting otherwise only one piece of personal data: email addresses. We do not enforce a real name policy.\n\n2. To protect people from accidentally revealing stuff about themselves that they do not want to be public, we make them go through a consent funnel before we allow them to post. \n\nWith all this, how to make a data policy for Edgeryders?\n\nI would say points 1 and 2 above are the core of the data policy. We also add:\n\n* Information on data storage and encryption methods. @matthias, can you please remind me how we use encryption, and for what?\n* A person responsible for data (Matt).\n* One or more people authorised to treat the data in research projects.\n* A process to detect data breaches. I think with open source projects such as Discourse this will be: pay attention to signalled vulnerabilities. Do we have a way to detect we have been hacked?\n* A process to prevent data breaches. I guess this will be: promptly install security patches on our stack. \n\nNotice that the GDPR applies to Edgeryders even if we do not do research.", "created_at": "2017-11-15 10:32:57.072277", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 00:31:07.348847", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 607, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 107.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65155, "user_id": 4861, "topic_id": 11708, "post_number": 6, "raw": "[quote=\"nadia, post:3, topic:11708, full:true\"]\nDo you know of any credible/viable alternatives to github?\n[/quote]\n\nIt depends on the \"for what?\".\n\nSeen as a *code hosting platform* it is basically serving as a git repository. As git is a *decentral* versioning software, I do not see much problems in **also** using github and the alternative could be just git itself.\n\nThen, github comes with tons of pretty nice extra functionality (like *issue tracking, project management, wikis, interaction with other services via hooks, analysis, Pull Request and Reviewe management, dynamic static website hosting*, ...).\nAnd, because it is the de-facto platform, it can also serve as a \"source code search engine\" and has even some social features (like 'star'ing and following other users and repos).\n\nEspecially the later is not yet covered by any platform I know of. And here, it is difficult to catch up with github, just because of its sheer size and the network effect. We would either need a very strong platform to counter that or something like ActivityPub but for code and developers, so that a decentralized code(r) fediverse can emerge.\n\nMost of the other functionality is handled by [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) - at least in the Enterprise version I guess. Also [gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/ ) (a gogs fork) seems to cover the basics really well. Then there are project management tools with git integration. I specifically know [redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) has (and do not judge redmine by its default looks), and I guess the more fancy ones like [Taiga](https://taiga.io/) serve this as well. There must be plenty developer-oriented web frameworks for that (e.g. [GNU Savannah](https://savannah.gnu.org/)).\n\nPersonally, I am not convinced by GitLab for my use cases. [Gitea](http://gitea.io) looks like it would hit the sweet spot for my use cases.\n\nThen I have to admit github has some awesome features, besides it using Rails and letting Aaron Petterson ([random talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMGmaRZtgM8)) work on tough stuff for Ruby and I use it personally/semi-professionally too. But for a company it should be easy and cheap to setup e.g. gitea and just always also push to github automatically (for extended visibility) when pushing to the own 'central' git repository.\n\nDoes that somewhat answer the question?", "created_at": "2019-11-22 13:37:48.281318", "updated_at": "2019-11-22 13:37:48.281318", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 398, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 47.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [65135], "is_reply_to": [65135], "is_liked_by": [5, 5698], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37106, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7134, "post_number": 13, "raw": "@yannick actually Matthias just made public a sort of \"pitch-like\" explanation.

Does this work for you? \n\n[quote=\"Jan, post:17, topic:13988\"]\nThe mother-child code relationship. Say, we code \u201chomosexuality\u201d and it intersects in the coded fragment with the issue of \u201cvarious approaches\u201d. Wojtek codes separately assuming that if we want to get the intersection the software will catch it and display. I code: mother: \u201chomosexuality\u201d and child: \u201chomosexuality: various approaches.\u201d What is your advice?\n[/quote]\n\n\nDoes @Wojt create a hierarchy in the backend, or just co-code? If the latter, that's a good approach that would ideally be combined with yours as well. Yours works, but only if you assign parent-child codes that makes sense from an SSNA point of view. First, the top-level code will not auto-assign to the ones below it. @hugi and our team on a different project tried having this happen automatically, but it lead to a giant overproliferation of codes that rendered the SSNA meaningless. Second, \"various approaches\" is too vague on its own (to be honest, I don't think the code \"homosexuality:various approaches\" is very descriptive either, so ideally the \"lower level\" code would be a more specific thing (e.g. \"lesbian relationships\"). \n\nThe plan (as articulated in [this post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/merging-multilingual-codes/13700/36?u=amelia), which you should both read carefully) with hierarchies is as follows: \n\n[quote=\"amelia, post:36, topic:13700\"]\nWait to assign hierarchies / parent-child relations in the backend until we do this together as a batch after the SSNA visualisation, since our hierarchical relationships now affect each other. Do this as much as you want in your own codebook\u2014 this is encouraged (see point 2)\n[/quote]\n \nSo, in short -- apply both top-level code and lower-level code if it applies, but be discerning. Use hierarchies in your own codebook, and we will then apply them together in the backend and use them to refine codes and apply top-level codes more widely if we need to -- it's very easy using the \"copy\" function in the backend to apply a top-level code to all instances of a lower-level code, but doing so automatically leads to too much vagueness/heavy co-occurrences on too high-level codes. If we do so more deliberately, in tandem with the SSNA creation, we get a more refined and accurate picture of the data. (as I describe this, @alberto, this might be a methodological point for us to note).   \n\n[quote=\"Jan, post:17, topic:13988\"]\nWojtek observed that if, say, he codes the whole entry with CODE1 and then codes a part of it with CODE2 and then wants to adde CODE3, say, to a word, he cannot do this. The system allows only two codes \u201con one bit of text\u201d, it seems.\n[/quote]\n\nJust right click outside of the selection and you'll be able to add more codes than 2 (we've discussed this on multiple occasions in the POPREBEL team and I go over it in training, but perhaps we need a more centralised documentation to refresh memories as it's a lot of information to keep track of). \n\n@matthias, feel free to check me on these answers :)", "created_at": "2020-06-23 08:51:15.374534", "updated_at": "2020-07-02 12:03:28.177267", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 651, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 8.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [78750, 79854], "is_reply_to": [79854], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57876, "user_id": 5277, "topic_id": 9369, "post_number": 2, "raw": "OMG, I see some similarities here to my story.

And in fact I struggle with it myself right now.  I live in California.  My kids are all grown and so my wife and I live in our own house.  The two of us are actually pretty flexible and if was just us, we could live someplace either more productive, like Brussels, or cheaper like Mexico.  But I have to care for my 92 year old mother who is very high maintenance and for a small feeble woman requires a great deal of work and planning on my part to insure that she lives in a supportive place.  I successfully sold her house last month, but now I have to move her to a senior care place that provides more direct care than the place she lives now. \n\nThis has to happen in January and while simple \"on paper\" is not simple at all.  California is so expensive now that the affordable options for that are not many, including our collectively buying a big place where we all live.  That won't work well for a number of reasons.  And although our kids are grown, they now have children and they want us to be around here so we can help them directly and to establish strong relationships with those kids so they feel the continuity of family.\n\nSo  my physical being is obliged to be here unless I want to opt out of being helpful, which is realistically out of the question, at least for now.  So my other community involvement is here in the virtual spaces.  That works pretty well as long as I can have an in-person component to that involvement.  All virtual is doable of course, but especially for me, it works better when that is combined with live in person contact.

Before having children he was a proponent of giving them full access to technology as soon as possible, but after observing the interactions of his first child with modern technologies (iPad) first hand, he shifted his view. He now keeps their access to technology limited. As a reason, he sites that the entry barrier for technology now is so low that children can interact with it without any effort, other than his own early experiences with computers which were characterized by a lot of trying and learning. \n\nI would like to invite @Vann to elaborate on this shift in views of his and invite everyone else to share their experiences and views on technology for children. \n\n* Are you a developer? When and how would you introduce your child to computers?\n* Are you a gamer? Would you play with your child?\n* Are your devices containing a large part of your professional and personal life? How do you explain that to your children?\n* Do you think it is possible to prepare a child for the future technology it is going to live with?\n* What technology (interactions) would you wish would exist?\n\nIn addition to what we might see as a potential ideal form of technology interaction for children there are also certain realities we are faced with:  \n\n* In times of home office children see their parents stare a screen for work for hours at a time. How do they react to that? How do you explain to them what you do and why?\n* Children see adults look at and stroke their smartphones all day. (Had my little cousin ask my to build here a smartphone shape toy to cuddle with). What do you think about children using smartphones? What do you think about smartphone toys/plushies?\n* Remote learning becomes more and more relevant. How do you make distinctions between using technology for learning and for playing with your children? What are your experiences with educational technology/programs? What would you like in this field? (@erik_lonroth your experiences and views on this topic would be very interesting) \n* In times of lockdown and globalised family and friend structures, children grow up with grandparents and other family members framed by facetime, WhatsApp and zoom windows more often than not. What do you think are the effects of that? (personally, I am seeing my childhood friends in a video call once a week, hold a contact to the family in another country via video calls as well and went through 5 years of long-distance with my partner before we moved together and I already can not always relate to digital connections being described as cold or distant as I am used to having some of my closest connections this way for years. And all of this development took place after my 18th birthday, so how might children perceive it who grew up with family videocalls?)\n\n@unclecj also posted an interesting article a while ago \"https://edgeryders.eu/t/assorted-thoughts-about-it-that-i-wish-i-knew-when-growing-up/11985\" and made reacted with some thoughtful remarks and reading suggestions when I brought up this Interesting can of work\" to him last week:\n\n[quote=\"unclecj, post:9, topic:11985\"]\n* I much appreciated @erik_lonroth way of educating his children about advertisements and [surveillance capitalism ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism) - the tragedy is that most entertainment and toys are branded, boring and shortlived\n* Not sure I understand what was meant with \u201ctoo easy\u201d, but meaningful things are frequently inaccessible [behind a veneer of boredom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8132948-the-winter-of-our-disconnect). I joke that I would never have learnt Linux if I had anything better than to spend my highschool weekends at the Linux User Group. The ability to (dis)assemble mentioned above feels relevant here too - technology is most powerful when you can control it from scratch in some fashion. Also [Richard Feynman](https://yahooeysblog.wordpress.com/2017/10/21/quote-of-the-day-2428/richard-feynman-nature/) \u201cEverybody knows, but **you\u2019ve got to stop and think about it** [my emphasis], to really get the pleasure about the complexity, the inconceivable nature of Nature\u201d\n* I completely respect parents wishing to shield their children simply from the **unfiltered complexity** of the world. Even regardless of the fierce attention economy mentioned above, an abundance of information lead to a scarcity of attention, and the capacity to comfortably ignore some things is a skill of adulthood.

It's in line with Matt's point above too - digital nomadism, not the extractive way.\n\nIn the end though, it's the same economics that seem to be pushing us out of cities whether we like it or not. Maybe it's because of the culture of house ownership I grew up in, in communist Romania, but I somehow cannot fathom the idea of rent for life in a city, and working just to be able to cover that rent.. let alone saving for harsh times.

This Biohackathon event will focus on experimenting with the microfluidic technology called \"Digital Microfluidics\" in the context of automation of molecular biology and microbiological applications, diving deeper in how microfluidics, automation and software are changing the way biology is performed and how researchers and and extended audience can benefit from these systems.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA number of tracks have been proposed such as:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tsensors</li>\n\n<li>\tbiosensors (isothermal amplification and PCR, staining )</li>\n\n<li>\tcell free system (GFP)</li>\n\n<li>machine vision</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nFocus will be on how bio-molecular assays can be performed in a micofluidic droplet-based environment and how visual programming and software is used to control such experiments. Thanks to the contribution of CellFree Technologies we will be able to run cell free experiments in microliter droplets.

There isn\u2019t anything malign going on, either - but the arguments are one-sided and myopic: They are selling technical \u201csolutions\u201d to complex societal challenges. This can never work, and is problematic in a myriad of ways.\n\n**I propose to re-frame the Smart City discourse away from a technology focus and towards a focus on societal impact** and ask a different set of questions than the tech vendors\u2019 solutions are trying to answer - like the following: \n\nWhat are the potential impacts we can have when introducing a data layer and machine decision making into public space? What are the desirable consequences, what are the damages we need to avoid? What are the intended vs unintended potential consequences, and what are the known unknowns? How can we design a city to be resilient and worth living in, instead of just a little more efficient?\n\n**In other words: What are better urban metrics in cities increasingly governed or shaped by algorithms? How can we put people first and make sure that their cities, their public spaces and agoras work for all of them and not just for the companies that sell some of the infrastructure?**\n\nWorking out these metrics, an analytical framework for assessing what\u2019s desirable in a Smart City, is the key to unlocking a real, meaningful debate. It\u2019s the basis on which policy makers, using participatory processes and involving all stakeholder groups, get empowered to start drafting meaningful Smart City policies and procurement guidelines. It\u2019s an important building block in allowing us to move society forward, one city at a time.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m convinced we need to build all Smart City policies around citizens/digital/human rights first, and with a strong priority on participatory processes, transparency, and accountability. \n\nBeyond that, these metrics need fleshing out.

But there was a lot of constructive talk going on, and I have a few leads for the future cooperations for us, which will need further development and some meetings. \n\n1. Ubele, our host organization from London, is fostering female entrepreneurship and social businesses among groups of color in London. Mostly run by people of Carribean or African descent, born in the UK and fighting a new wave of racism, which they fought against in the 60-ties and 70-ties and felt like they've succeeded, until Brexit. \n\n    Anyhow, they just got hold of a space in Tottenham that is stunning and very affordable, and huge. They plan to spend 2018 on various collaborations that could lead to turning this space into an interesting hub and sustainable project, ideally a mix of projects. I talked with one of the founders and she is really keen on meeting sometime soon, in Brussels or London, to have a chat and see what we could do. \n\n2. Palermo - my dear friends and ex-colleagues from Palermo are now working on recovering properties from the mafia and they got a hold of a couple of them already. The newest one is a big farmland at the outskirts of Palermo, where they want to run a project supporting migrants in Palermo (there's plenty of them, mostly from Nigeria, Ghana, Bangladesh), victims of human trafficking or people escaping their countries. They are now only waiting for the final document and they will be moving there for a decade to start with. I also suggested we could be working with them and as soon as the papers arrive, we could have a talk as well with them. \n\n3. A new museum in Wroclaw - a brand new friend of mine, a female construction engineer from Wroclaw, is managing construction of cultural sites in Wroclaw and now she's working on a very vaguely described new space that will be constructed sometime soon in the city. This is a bit of a long shot and we decided not to apply right now with a collaboration as she is afraid the ministry of culture in Poland would not understand a thing, but once the concept and the construction is approved, we could get some funding to run a conservation laboratory for citizens in the site. The museum will be called Museum of Squeaking Floors (or something like this) and the idea is to bring falling apart items from Ossolineum collections in Lviv and restore them - Ukraine doesn't want to give them to Poland but has no money to save them. It would be a way to protect them and show them for a limited time to Polish audiences. I know this is not exactly something we've done so far, but I think this could be a very interesting project to work on in the near future. \n\nAny comments and ideas very welcome.", "created_at": "2018-01-17 12:44:08.635501", "updated_at": "2018-01-17 19:23:38.635405", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 518, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 151.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 1935, 3703, 4265], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80601, "user_id": 5544, "topic_id": 14079, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Hello,\n\nIt\u2019s been a while!

We talked about this topic in the [reflections](https://edgeryders.eu/t/fellowship-post-reflections-and-wayward-thoughts/6659) post we just published.  Overall, I think we should aim to be clear with the language we choose, but also recognize that our words will always be co-opted by the right/neo-liberal agenda.  In addition, they are inherently loaded words, we are in fact talking about changing the world, and not everyone will be into that.  But also recognizing that certain words have become trigger words not because of what they mean, but the meaning that capitalism/nation states/ governments have put into them.  Communism being case in point.  When most people think about communism, they think Stalinist USSR or other state controlled system.  We harken back to the original meaning of the word, most used in examples like early Marx theory, the French Commune, or the communism of the Spanish Civil War.  Even now, words like \"autonomy\", \"mindfulness\", \"wellness\" have all been co-opted and likely in the future will be unusable.  What I think our mission is is to be explicitly clear about the meaning of words and refuse to let the powers that be taint that meaning.

Some of you might know me, i used to work for UNDP in Egypt, ran a social innovation lab. Currently I'm doing my postgrad in London in Service Design and I am focused on social entrepreneurship. My main insight through my research is that there's a huge need for peer-peer learning and concretising a network of people that could help each other. People are already reliant on their personal networks for help, but it's very dispersed and informal. A lot of people don't have access to the \"support services\" and they're keen on starting something but they can't find someone to answer their questions or to \"mentor\" them one-off. And the concept of meetups is virtually non-existent.There have been a few examples where people help each other without an expectation in return.\n\nAlso, I found that a lot of people have amazing experiences and insights but aren't willing to participate in the \"ecosystem\" because they don't see the value or have a negative perception of the ecosystem - but these \"silent soldiers\" have extremely valuable experiences. So I'm hoping to find a way to get those people to engage and to share. \n\nSo the reason why I am here is to see if anyone has any advice/resources on what it takes to build strong sustainable communities of people that help each other out.

Porten is a gathering of some ten local associations trying to collaborate to create a good and healthy community. I'm trying to induce as many as possible of the 10 principles of burning man, mixed with values from open source and various other places I roam and find inspiration from. This has had some success and the community is indeed starting to enbrace some of it. More activities than ever has been spawned over the last year, where these principles and values are getting introduced. Its a slow process, but this is for real.\n\nAs many small communities I guess, it has few (if any) means of communicating locally except f\u00f6r Ad-driven platforms such as Facebook. These Facebook and Ad backed forums reak of hate, conflict and where \"the good forces\" has no real or good means to handle that. We don't want it.\n\nIn Porten, we don't have people fluent in IT and computers. They don't speak english very well, but have a need to be able to meet online and discuss. Also we want young people (under 16) to be able to participate. So, its problematic to run our own IT infrastructure.\n\nI'm looking for help setup and run a \"discouse\" server and collaborate with edgeryders elsewhere in europe that struggle with these questions. \"How to build real communities\" with the help of internet.

We can use them to explore the different accelerators (though many don't list that much information) and figure out how to match ideas with accelerators. However, most of the accelerator profiles on this website are empty or semi-empty.

Will post a separate one with an updated proposal that takes your considerations into account. (The major pain pont raised was actually that the primary navigation (Discourse categories) should not guide users to abandoned parts of the website.)\n\nRegarding the specific questions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>I am ok with having this information architecture discussion out in public. No problem at all.</li>\n\n<li>Yes, we're going to have string based search. It's actually a pretty fast and pretty good auto-completing search in Discourse, as judged from my limited tests.</li>\n\n<li>Tagging use case to \"quickly populate a new project with existing (but related) content\": Sounds like a good use case. Can also be implemented by exploiting the similarities between the campaigns / challenges between projects. This emerged today in the MENA YP call, where it showed that many challenges / topics for outreach are closely related to prior Edgeryders work (like, say, \"Mission: How to make a living\"). Below, I'll propose to have challenges in the category tree, which would also cover this use case.</li>\n\n<li>\"space for multiple, overlapping ontologies\": This can be done in Discourse by aggregating tags into named \"tag groups\" in the admin backend. So one tag group is for OpenCare, one for Stewardship etc.. Tag groups may or may not overlap, I did not test that yet. To prevent people from using (say) OpenCare tags in non-OpenCare content, it is possible to set the tag \"OpenCare\" itself as a parent tag of the tag group. So only after tagging \"OpenCare\", the OpenCare tag groups would become available in the suggestions. If this is what you want, no need for a Github issue. If you also want existing tags to be automatically imported into various tag groups, make an issue for that.</li>\n\n<li>\"finding a way to track pageviews by project\": Yes, please create a Github issue for that. Pretty sure this can be solved with one of the advanced Analytics features where Ruby code hands a hidden variable to the tracking code. We'll have to look into it in more detail still.</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2017-06-20 00:12:56", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.296443", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 374, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19044], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17070, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 6386, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Thank you for the detailed comment. Two things happened since I wrote this yesterday:\n\nOne, I finished substantial edits right after your posted your comment, including a proposed use for tags to keep projects together. Maybe revisit the text and see if that sounds more reasonable now. (Little background: I don't like \"spontaneous folksonomy tags\", at all, and use them for nothing. But when tags are used consistently, they are useful, esp. since Discourse tags can be followed. People wanting to keep their project content together in Discourse, and send updates to their followers, would use them consistently. Plus, tags don't clutter lists like dead projects did for the current edgeryders.eu. Which is why I really don't want to allow users to create, or get, custom categories for their projects. Categories for a few flagship projects are a different matter, I'm not opposed to that. But most projects would be kept toether by tags only.)\n\nTwo, I realized that we call it \"Challenges\" currently, but what we collect are not new solutions or expert help, but people showcasing the stuff they are working on. (I think the same happens on IDEO, which was the inspiration.) People like to do that kind of thing \u2026 being a bit proud of achievements, getting some kudos and feedback, and perhaps finding some new project collaborators and friends. The exact same thing will happen with the proposed \"Discourse topics as challenges\" logic. This is how Edgeryders is, and it won't change. We'll not be a Quora / Stack Exchange style site for highly detailed questions, rather a kind of \"online project expo\" for non-code DIY and / or open source projects. (I hope @Nadia sees it the same way about the type of content and interaction we'll be able to draw.)\n\nWith that said about what the content will be like, I still like \"categories by topic\" much better than \"categories by project\" (as that has lead to terrible clutterring with dead projects).

(If you find a way to manage the access rights with less clutter in the category namespace, I'd welcome that though.)\n\nThe blog category is just an idea, to have something similar to the current official company blog. The content structure is the same as in a category of topics, just the presentation format is different to reach out to other audiences like investors / potential clients. It would be more stylish, not like a forum, with content right on the page instead of starting with a list of topics. If we can do with just one forum category for the blog, even better, as it means less work on the software.\n\nFinal note John, all the more technical work and discussions for implementing the Discourse platform happens here: <a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues\">https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues</a>.

It was a nice meet up and we got to know what are the main concerns of the local initiative here and this showed up some different ways to cooperate. Their main fields of work are the garbage problem, the school, and some surf club activities.\n\nThe initiative is formed from 11 Sidi Kaouki Residents as an organizational core group.\n\n\n## 1. Garbage collection problem\n\nNow it is confirmed that there is[ no proper wast management system](http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2016/08/24/sidi-kaouki-poubelles-dechets-saletes-hotels_n_11679062.html) in Sidi Kaouki, there is only one big \"container\" on the road that was put there, with initial plans or unclear plans of collecting the garbage from there to be dumped in Essaouira or nearby cities, but this never happens. There is no company that collects the garbage from Kaouki, Also there is no public bins for obvious reasons. The initiative organizes some beach clean-up days and then collect all plastics and burn it. This is the used solution so far. \n\n**Ideas** some are already here in the [dynalist](https://dynalist.io/d/8I41AdtRSel0ZFVKeNvovZzv#z=BEMGYaQ-cK_HVGbGtF6iuUOj) but initially participate in the beach clean up to get to know the active people in kaouki and help cleaning the beach. others like precious plastic workshop or beach cleaning robots are valid ways to go for. \n\nThe situation is not extreme, it could be easily solved, It is worth mentioning that the use of plastic bags is reduced in Kaouki and nearby areas, Super market reduced the plastic bags usage. \n\n\n## 2. School situation\n\n* The nearby school is 2-3 km away from Sidi kaouki, It serves Sidi Kaouki and nearby villages.\n\n* Number of students is around 63, ranging from 6 to 14 years old, with 3 teachers\n\n* We didn't see the school yet, but reportedly it is not in good shape, it needs some to be repaired. another organization from Casablanca is coming on the 21st of January to provide some repairs including windows, doors, ceiling and some paint. ( when it rains for example there is no school day as the roof can't manage the rain ) . By March they will provide some bicycles for the kids to be able to reach the school. \n\n**Ideas**  initially what could be done is furniture ( @m_tantawy may be this could be the first furniture set Bitcut produces ) others to be discussed if someone is interested in any educational activities or workshops for kids ( @HadeerGhareeb ) the school is the way to go. \n\n\n## 3. Surf Club\n\nSome of the association members are working in surfing, so the direct connection would be to work together on the [surf boards project.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/i-want-to-come-to-the-residency-in-kaouiki-and-make-beautiful-wooden-light-surfboards-using-mainly-hand-tools-and-materials-that-grows-locally-or-that-are-easy-to-find-in-morocco/7856/2) \non a side note, bamboo is being planted here and could be bought from Essaouira so we can experiment with bamboo  surfboards  @Sofien-Dahem @Maatoug \n[text-direction=rtl]\n\u0628\u0639\u0636\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u0649 \u0633\u064a\u062f\u0649 \u0643\u0627\u0648\u0643\u0649 \u064a\u0639\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u0649 \"\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0641 \u0643\u0644\u0648\u0628 \" \u0648 \u0645\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0646 \u0646\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0635\u0644 \u0645\u0639\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u0649 \u0641\u0649 \u0645\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d ...\u0627\u064a\u0636\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0645\u0628\u0648 \u0645\u062a\u0648\u0641\u0631 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0648\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0648 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0646\u0627 \u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0641\u0649 \u0635\u0646\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d\n[/text-direction]", "created_at": "2018-01-17 20:09:58.605405", "updated_at": "2018-03-21 12:24:03.889740", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 560, "wiki": true, "reads": 23, "score": 124.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4267, 3782, 4275, 4040], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86883, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12078, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hej, just came about this post again and wondered if maybe you would like to join our webinar on developing a shared SciFi economic world?\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/how-to-build-a-world-a-webinar-with-the-worldbuilding-academys-core-team/14773", "created_at": "2020-11-13 14:10:44.908535", "updated_at": "2020-11-13 14:10:44.908535", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 43, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 41.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [86478], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5538], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61887, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 10242, "post_number": 33, "raw": "Database looks fine.\n\nI found the error.

The Edgeryders organisation was the organisation which would then take responsibility for managing the funds.\u00a0We did manage to get past the first round (administrative due diligence). It was a good way to go about it in that it also helped us better understand what people in the OpenCare/broader Edgeryders community need. The design of the OpenVillage festival is based on what we learned.\n\nI don't know if you saw that we just won a World Bank bid. The work we will be doing will build on this idea of nurturing initiatives as part of a collective effort towards something. We're still learning how to do this, but the results so far are promising. So maybe it could make sense to dedicate a session to sharing strategies, even past funding applications that worked for remixing etc...\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-20 10:35:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:44.003840", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 213, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 16.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3704], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85583, "user_id": 6836, "topic_id": 14594, "post_number": 16, "raw": "**If you are interested and want to join the event comment here.

I am, I guess, less inclined to see \"Economics\" as a monolithic enterprise.

I find myself ever more caught up in my small economics faculty as an advocate of telling the truth about systemic racial and socio-economic discrimination in this country. I see it as a form of science -- not to tell this story is a clear misrepresentation -- it is a lie about how our economy works, and it is a lie that has suppressed the legitimate aspirations of several classes of our fellow citizens, and which, moreover, holds our economy back -- there are economists who have written in well-regarded economics journals about how this is the case. I don't need to knock the profession as a whole to tell this story -- just those who are not willing to seek out the truth.\n\nAnd that is what bothers me about Graeber -- he takes sides in a way that does not make clear that this is ultimately science that we are doing, not merely taking sides.

We can testify to that with our lab: it takes a lot of work, especially when what you do is relatively obscure. Then getting people to actually _care_ is harder still. On the other hand, painting a rosy picture, using buzzwords and rubbing shoulders with those who have the means to take your project to the next level can also be toxic. Which factors make it harder or easier? Which kinds of obstacles do we encounter? How should we make these highly consequential, but often cloudy judgment calls? How is it all connected to business models and funding?\n\nI am personally extremely interested in a session around this topic. Since you mention it in this session proposal, I think it would be a great topic for the discussion part of the session @albertorey @noemi @gehan @woodbinehealth. We can open it up for others with similar or completely different experiences on communication and going out there to 'sell' your ideas to your relevant audience. \n\nPinging those involved in the discussion so far for their thoughts @nadia @baderdean @alberto @unknown_author @johncoate @HadeerGhareeb @Yosser @MurielAboulrouss", "created_at": "2017-09-01 20:41:01.012821", "updated_at": "2018-03-09 19:52:32.606452", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 269, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 23.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35238, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 6396, "post_number": 15, "raw": "It helps I think when the person responsible for the message, outreach and fundraising also either manages the on-the-ground work of the mission itself, or knows enough to do it, but works closely with someone to whom it is delegated.

But trees can't absorb particulates, which are are microscopic solid or liquid matter suspended in the atmosphere of Earth, coming from natural sources (i.e. volcanos) or anthropogenic (i.e. cars emissions). Instead, \"Particulate matter can clog stomatal openings of plants and interfere with photosynthesis functions. In this manner, high particulate matter concentrations in the atmosphere can lead to growth stunting or mortality in some plant species\" (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates)).

(I even heard that, while it's in principle possible to apply as just one company, a partnership of companies that complement each other is preferred.) But I don't think that any partner is allowed to be a non-profit \u2013 they simply state \"Only applications from for-profit SMEs\" <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">here</a>. So it seems Edgeryders could only be listed as a non-project partner, which may mean in practice that none of the grant money can be spent on it (?).\n\nThe eligibility criteria state that a company must not be engaged in a parallel phase 1 or phase 2 application to be eligible: \"SME instrument: No concurrent submission or implementation with another phase 1 or phase 2 project. [...] SMEs [...] need to focus their applications but have the chance to come back due to the permanently open call\" [<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">source</a>, at p. 2 and footnote 5]. So this seems to mean, you can re-apply after getting a decision for the previous application (about two months after the cut-off date for phase 1).\n\nSo it seems we're running into a shortage of companies :D I'd like to use my company for a SMEInst application for Makerfox, so it would not be available for a parallel application for the ethnography tool. But I'm open to any useful suggestion \u2013 say, using my company for the ethnography tool, if we find a better alternative for a Makerfox applicant.\n\n<a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>, why do you think your company is not apt for the ethnography tool application? Because the Horizon 2020 funding is for developing innovative products, so they would not like simply outsourcing the software development part?

The project of an OpenCare clinic is an example: that's not a deliverable of OpenCare, but if we did manage to make one it would add incredible value. Conversely, OpenCare would lend an OpenCare clinic a very large value. I conclude it does not make sense to just think project management and deliver the project. We must to that, but as we do it we must never lose sight of the bigger picture.

It uses standard clustering algos, based on geometric distance (Cartesian? Cosine?).

The voting process that picks up the \"winners\" is at risk of being mathematically unfair. This was the great argument made by @pietro on all kind of online \"voting\" (likes, retweets, etc.). I am not certain of the technicalities here, a lot depends on who gets to see which statements to agree/disagree with, and on the sequencing between voting and looking at results. In my demo that was real time: people could see \"winners\" emerging, and so they would agree with them even more. But maybe they do not do it like that in real use cases. \n\nIMHO, Taiwan is a success story... but its driving force is [Audrey Tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang).

We need to talk about it, but <a href=\"https://www.leapin.eu/faq/receiving-funds\">here </a>it is:\n\nThere are two type of salaries: (1) board member salary &amp; (2) employee salary. The tax rates on the two type of salaries are:\n\n1. Tax rates of board member salary:\n\nThe board member salary is taxed with personal income tax (20%) in Estonia, independent on whether the actual duties were performed in Estonia or abroad. Double taxation here can be avoided by the relevant agreements between Estonia and your country of residence (see the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fin.ee/overview-of-estonian-bilateral-conventions-for-avoidance-of-double-taxation-and-prevention-of-fiscal-evasion\" target=\"_blank\">list of countries here...</a>). Such salary is also taxed with social tax (33%) in Estonia unless you can provide evidence that you are already paying social contributions in another EU country (A1 form, formerly E101). In the latter case, no social tax applies in Estonia.\u00a0\n\nTo sum it up, if you receive 100 EUR net, almost 65 EUR are paid in taxes in Estonia, unless you have an A1 form (in the latter case taxes are ca 25 EUR).\n\n2. Tax rates on employee salary:\n\nIf you perform all the work outside Estonia (and thus, are treated as a non-resident in Estonia), no personal income tax nor social tax are paid on employee salary in Estonia. In that case, you are responsible for paying taxes in the country where you are a tax resident as an individual person. In case of interest, you need to be able to prove to Estonian authorities that the real work was performed outside of Estonia. However, your tax arrangements abroad are not their concern here.\n\nBy default, all salary payments you receive from your own company are considered as a board member salary. If you have a sufficient ground and can decide to register some of the salary as an employee salary, you can do it.\u00a0\n\n// Also, rent pay is not deductible!

However, LOTE4 tickets are offered on Makerfox, in different variants if we want (with / without accomodation etc.). Tickets would have a price tag, but tasks would be paid with the full ticket price each (with the Makerfox Transfer feature), or alternatively according to reported worktime and an hourly rate that is the same for everyone (egalitarian \"all time paid equal\"). When people have enough incoming Makerfox Transfer (\"Makercoins\" as people started calling it) for the ticket, a trade is found and they get their ticket. Example process:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>User Alice signs up on Makerfox, orders a LOTE4 ticket of their choice (standard ticket for 1350 USD).</li>\n\n<li>User Alice signs up for a task on edgeryders.eu to do an interview, completes it and marks it as done (putting \"5 hours worktime\" in the closing comment, and their Makerfox username).</li>\n\n<li>LOTE4 user sends 1350 USD via Makerfox Transfer to the user.

It is a 1h online session with an expert panel having a conversation on the topic while the audience can engage via questions in the chat.*\n\n**As a freelancer, as well as other remote workers, are often relying a lot on a barrage of digital tools and applications to do their work. New technologies can and have changed whole industries and are a huge reason for the rise of the freelancing economy.**\n\nIn this session, we discuss the positive and negative aspects of technology used and needed by freelancers and remote workers with an expert panel representing technology provider/developer, freelancing organisations and working freelancers. The audience can contribute their own questions via the chat during the session.\n\n**Some of our questions**:\n\n* Which tools have made \"all the difference\" for the work of freelancers?\n* What about the \"monopoles\" for certain software providers such as Adobe, Google or Microsoft that force freelancers to use and buy those tools to be able to work with their clients.\n* Which common problems, like for example easy workload tracking, still haven't been properly solved? What improvements would freelancers desperately need?\n\nThe conversation panel consists of:\n\n1. A technology for freelancing provider representative ([Matthew Mottola](https://edgeryders.eu/t/matthew-mottola-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14480))\n2. A \"professional freelancer\" representative ([Dani Ifrim](https://edgeryders.eu/t/dani-ifrim-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14584))\n3. A freelancing organisation representative ( [Nicole Gray](https://edgeryders.eu/t/nicole-gray-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14536))\n\nIf you are interested and want to join the event or even contribute to it either in form of questions or directly to the panel please comment below.\n\nLooking forward to it!\n\n**You can share this event via this link: 1. https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14495**\n\n## To register for this event just comment on this topic.\nYou will be sent the zoom link to join the session 1 day before the event (another round of links will be sent out 1h before the event for those who register late).\n\n*This event is part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016.

It means we thought we could control things and turned out we don't. \nSo, my point of view is that geoengineering belongs to a hierarchical (and capitalist) perspective, even if it's for the good (not mentioning that richer people won't suffer climate change consequencies as the poorer people).

I have been involved in projects promoting women's rights, children's rights, education, cultural promotion, rights of people with disabilities, migration, community involvement. Currently, I am part of a small team wishing to organise the first LGBTIQ international film festival in Bucharest. I am constantly looking into human rights-focused projects in Romania and trying to keep abreast with all developments in the field.\u00a0\n\nThe challenges that I have been facing so far relate to the lack of transparency in obtaining funding for projects that, unfortunately, continues to be a widespread phenomenon in Romania. The manner I managed to overcome this has been simply by persevering, improving my drafting skills and using creativity to fill in the gaps in the field. In addition, networking is an increasingly important factor that I have been actively working on.\u00a0\n\nSpot the Future would be extremely helpful in Romania, especially since there is no established forum where young people with initiative could meet up to discuss their ideas and support each other. It's something I believe we are in need of and that would be extremely helpful for the imperative networking one needs to undertake should they embark on the path of community development and human rights promotion.\u00a0\n\nI would use the contacts I already have to promote success stories and establish a network of people working on human rights in Romania. In addition, I would also focus on the online community, which, even though rather scattered at the moment, is rapidly developing into a protoplatform. I do not momentarily have a blog but this would be a nice way to engage people online and social media promotion would ensure the necessary boost . I also believe that an online platform has to be put in place in order to facilitate communicate, support and interaction. This could also contain funding and partnership opportunities.\u00a0\n\nThat's about me.

By that metric, the Polis software is doing well \u2026 and if only because it was, perhaps by chance, the tool of choice for the government of Taiwan at a time when they were open to real e-democracy.\n\nThe question becomes, how can we propose or design a path for our set of consultation and sensemaking tools to do the same?

They are pushing their data onto Azure, making it GDPR and EIDAS compliant. That changed my thinking, because it showed me as even these sterling silver pieces of European thinking ends up in the Silicon Valley cloud.\nWe need to break the number-person relationship: when you get born, you receive a number from the state, and the game\u2019s up. I dream of disposable identities, that we set up with the purpose of entering into a relationship, like for example receiving a service. A good analogy is one-time email addresses: you get an email address, you sign up to some online service with it, use it ONCE to receive the email to confirm you do control that email, and then it self destructs.\n\n\n\n**What should the EU do practically?**\n\nGovernance instead of government. Here\u2019s my take: the kind of society you are looking at is anarcho-communist. The communist part is that infrastructure is fully centralized, like in the 30 glorieuse. Anything that runs onto the infrastructure is fully permissionless. That\u2019s the anarchist part.

So I'd definitely like to keep across how things develop, and in fact think it could be opportune for you, @alberto, @matthias and I to get together to flesh out a roadmap of sorts at some point. As you would have seen from my Feedback concpt note, I'm definitely already thinking meta-strategically about how our research unit, OpenVillage and now yes the culture squad can leverage and benefit each others' projects and communities. \n\nI'll be presenting at the [participatory governance in culture conference](http://conference.participatory-governance-in-culture.net/) on behalf of [Percolab](http://www.percolab.com/), an international cooperative enterprise with whom I've collaborated and will continue to in some capacity (off to their French cell's team retreat tomorrow for example). Their whole thing is about animating the paradigm shift towards generative futures and do organizational and community development. They're more coming from a social entrepreneurship take - so I'm not completely aligned to be honest - but they use some super interesting techniques referencing the commons, self-management/ organising, co-design and of course collective intelligence, and I see great value in their work. My presentation will be on \"generative participatory governance: from organisational culture to inclusive citizenship,\" and I'll share it once it's done. I'll also do my best to take notes at relevant presentations during the rest of the conference and share an update here. \n\nThen I'm off to the [Innocracy conference](http://www.progressives-zentrum.org/innocracy-conference-on-democratic-innovation/?lang=en) with @nadia to leverage some strategic opportunities for Recode.

Particularly the ones about meeting the edgeryders and describing events like Open Village: they end up mostly summarising stories that people have told elsewhere, and I am worried that coding them will create some false associations (it will look on the graph like people are discussing Open Insulin, but really it is just an announcement from the community manager). I don't want to skew the graph in this way. I will still go through and make sure actual content isn't there, but otherwise I think it is better to leave them. I've created a little code to mark the post as read but not coded (\"nc\") and will delete that code once I'm done.\n\nIf anyone has any objections or counterpoints, do let me know.\n\nSecondly, I want to have a discussion about priorities from here on out. At this point, there are a few different things I could prioritise.\n\n1) Coding the remaining uncoded stories. These all have 0, 1 or 2 comments (max), or they are authored by community managers.\n\n2) Doing a second pass of existing codes and cleaning them up. This is very important, but will be very slow going since the technology is not there to support it.\n\n3) Establishing clear hierarchies among codes. Same issue as pont 2 (important, but tech doesn't support doing so easily).\n\n4) Authoring papers about ethnographic findings.

We later decided against that (I think rightly so, to keep hired team members and ourselves \"close to our workplace\", which is Discourse, making everyone more competent in the software they should use most). That leaves very little use for Open Project.</li>\n\n<li>The only really useful piece is the project Gantt chart, but we can have that <a href=\"https://www.officetimeline.com/gantt-chart-google-docs\">using Google Spreadsheets</a>, too. Which means it integrates with our current file storage solution. And for presentation quality Gantt charts, a different tool was used by Alberto anyway.</li>\n\n<li>Open Project is a lot of form filling, which is not the style of collaboration in our typical project teams. It would make collaboration more structured and organized (admitted!), but only if our hired people use it too. Which they won't, I believe. Matrix seems much better, because it's more enjoyable. It's simply better work/life integration, allowing to mix in some chatting and joking \u2026</li>\n\n<li>Discourse plus Matrix already feels complex from the webmaster's point of view, but manageable and it seems realistic to achieve a high quality and good integration. When adding Open Project to the mix, that would change. I personally haven't even looked into Open Project since doing\u00a0 the setup.</li>\n\n<li>At the current rate of usage, I fear it will end up unused shortly, like our Booktype installation at books.edgeryders.eu (which, by the way, will be closed down soon, its content also moving to Discourse).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n(But I also know @Nadia is experimenting with it for the MENA Youth Platform project, and intends to let all team members on it.

There's no overall vision, direction, no integration of partial systems etc.. The Energiewende (energy system transition) in Germany is a good example for the half-measures and internal contradictions that this leads to.\n\nPolitics has to be systems engineering, and if it does not work because too many people are involved and they demand compromises, then the unit of politics has to be broken down into smaller units until it works. No need for indicators then, because the system is designed right from the beginning to not have any negative impact on the environment etc.. \n\nIndicators are only needed when dealing with half-measures and compromises. The proper way in engineering is to include a safety margin \u2013 means, human civilization must be designed as a net benefit for nature to compensate for the accidents when it won't be. (For life-critical applications the safety margin is usually 500% \u2013 for example, a lifting cable of a crane will have a breaking strength of five times the maximum allowed load on the crane.

In the spring of 2016, the weeks after my father passed away, I wrote a pathetic (in its original sense) little essay that I now felt inspired to share with you. Related to [social entrepreneurship](https://edgeryders.eu/search?q=entrepreneurship), [Assorted thoughts about IT that I wish I knew when growing up](https://edgeryders.eu/t/assorted-thoughts-about-it-that-i-wish-i-knew-when-growing-up/11985), [attention economy vs ADD](https://edgeryders.eu/t/my-story-by-cj-sveningsson/11940/6?u=unclecj), [Teaching Teachers Open Source](https://edgeryders.eu/t/teaching-teachers-open-source/9881) and [Internet of Humans](https://edgeryders.eu/t/internet-of-humans-matchmaking-event-in-stockholm/9705) in general, I share with you my sense of urgency to do good:\n\n> Most of you will know what I have gone through recently with my father passing away to cancer. Your thoughts and prayers are deeply appreciated.\n> \n> What I haven't shared until now are the thoughts and renewed sense of urgency (and reverence) the ordeal brought to me. As a background, my beloved father was a life-long member of the Gnosj\u00f6 congregation of the Swedish Alliance Missionary church. There was nothing super-natural about what resonated in me, but reverend Arne Henrysson's memorial service to dad highlighted the meaning of the congregation and prayer. I jest that their friends might pray to Santa Claus, but regardless their thoughts and love for my father and mother are tangible and have carried them. I also got to contemplate the fruits of my dad's life, and it was nice to see gifts in his memory go to [an orphanage in Tanzania](http://www.varberghomeofpeace.org/) my parents visited. The gardens of my father, both material and spiritual, were indeed lovingly cultivated and beautiful to behold.\n> \n> The other morning, being as well rested as I can be, I had a frustrating dream. I had constructed a contraption for portable music, stringing together a cassette player with speakers. The friend I showed it to was unimpressed, trumping me by drawing on greater innovation and produced a much nicer and as affordable contraption based on streaming music and bluetooth speakers.\n> \n> The dream was founded in my sense of urgency to just do something about the most glaringly in need people I saw that week - the orphans in Tanzania and the refugees and other marginalized in Sweden. I just wanted to pack a suitcase of raspberry pis and my computer technology education to go help. The dream highlighted to me how that urgency could be mistaken - I would of course like to build on any other efforts being made by others, draw on the innate potential of the receivers and strive towards the greatest result rather than losing myself in pride over my missionary sacrifice.\n> \n> We clearly live in the fascinating age *\"when wireless is perfectly applied\"* ([Nikola Tesla, \"When woman is boss\", 1926](http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1926-01-30.htm)). Innovation, education and change can be spread and reused with minimal effort only limited by how fast humans can adapt. In light of that, I believe the missionary (in the widest sense) and philanthropic roles need to change, but I haven't yet arrived at how. That is the thought and question I want to reach out to you - as a community and good individuals, just what do we do now, to feel and achieve good?\n> \n> I decided not to go to Tanzania or the Migrationsverket shelters just today, but writing this letter to my best friends and the brightest minds I know felt like the wisest option. Thank you for your condolences, taking part in my thoughts and just being your beautiful selves.\n> \n> Related reading: \"[Capitalism is making way for the age of free](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/31/capitalism-age-of-free-internet-of-things-economic-shift)\"\n\n*PS.

Its a complicated debate, as all things, because on the one hand there is the individual \"choice\" to smoke or eat unhealthy food.  But then there is the social pressures to engage in those practices because they are productive in a short term economic sense to the corporations.  The advertising and marketing of \"unhealthy\" products is utterly immoral (if you have any doubt, not that I think you do, but an interesting practice is to watch 30mins of kids cartoons.  The ads are exclusively for high sugar foods, the volume goes up in the commercials, and the marketing idea is that kids are more susceptible to marketing and they will put pressure on the parents.  Sick.)  There is also the class aspect of \"choice\", in that a busy mom working 3 jobs may not have the resources or time to prepare \"healthy\" food, the existence of \"food deserts\" in poor communities, and the inability to exercise.  Looking at smoking, they have spent billions of dollars over the last decades to push smoking as a relaxation tool, so can we really blame people for using as such and then getting addicted?  So my question is always, how can we address the individual without applying a sense of blame for their \"choice\" (not that I think you are doing that, but definitely what happens in our culture).

This cluster consists of 120 local enterprises, employing some 400 people, created or consolidated in the last 20 years in or near the city of Messina, in Sicily.\n\n### Who and what is involved? Who are the key players? Dynamics?\n\nThe process was initiated in 1998 by a group of local people led by a physicist; they started by creating a research centre called EcosMed. EcosMed took on the mantle of championing a specific vision for local development, and over time managed to get several other enterprises up and running and working together as a cluster (see below). In 2010, they leveraged a European policy (green certificates for producing renewable energy) and a national/regional one (a large foundation called Fondazione con il Sud was doubling capital to any Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 being constituted in Italy\u2019s Mezzogiorno) to create FCM as a superstructure. FCM also has institutional partners, like business associations and a cooperative bank called Banca Etica. FCM used its capital to give solar panels to whoever wanted them: they created a \u201cpeople\u2019s energy company\u201d and installed 2MW of photovoltaic capacity. The green certificates made sure that FCM could then count on 20 years of subsidies; it thus transformed a pile of dead money into a stable revenue stream.\n\n### Why is this interesting? What is the edge of the approach?\n\nFrom an economic point of view, the cluster made three moves which contain the seeds of long-termism.\n\n1. Relational goods. Some goods store value because they encode relationships. Example: several world-famous artists in the Mediterranean area donated pieces to Fondazione Horcynus Orca, the cluster\u2019s main art org. In fact, FHO runs a contemporary art museum that never bought any piece, everything was donated or produced in-house via artist residencies. This collection is worth several millions, but of course FHO could not really sell it except in very dire circumstances. Instead, they leverage it to attract private donors. Other example: Messina had a local brewery, Birrificio di Messina. This was purchased by Heineken, that ended up closing the plant and relocating production, keeping the brand. FCM persuaded the laid-off workers to start a cooperative to make a new brewery, and attracted a 6M EUR investment. 700 people attended the brewery\u2019s grandopening, because \u201cthe beer tastes very good, but it also carries the values of dignity, community resurrection and human development to purchasers\u201d. The new company was already turning a profit in its first year.\n\n2. Stocks over flows. The creation of FCM marked a shift from producing income (a flow) to fund Messina\u2019s social and civic transformation to securing the capital (various stocks) that generate that income. The difference is resilience: if you are sitting on your own stocks, you are not at the mercy of short-term changes in marked conditions (or, worse, funding landscapes), and you have the breathing space to plan countermoves when difficulties strike.\n\n3. A system, not a network. \u201cIn a network, participants look for how to make the most of what others are doing. In a system, participants are willing to re-orient their work, so as to better work with the other participants.\u201d If you are a construction company, you must not be lazy, and be open to using new technologies. If you are a social cooperative, you must look away from providing standardized services to customizing what they do in order to better valorize the capabilities of the people they are assisting. And so on.\n\n### Questions it sparks? What does this make you want to learn more about?\n\nHow do you get from zero to a fully formed cluster? The Messina fledgling cluster survived 12 years before FCM was launched, \u201cwith great difficulty\u201d.\n\nCan you imagine a similar approach for larger territories? What would it look like?\n\n### Assumptions? What assumptions are underlying the logic of X? How do they see the world? What does it mean for systems transformation?\n\n\u201cWe believe that there is a correlation between the environmental crisis and inequality. We are seeing: irreversibilities in the environmental crisis and so much inequality that it is even stifling traditional economic development. Some systems are imbalanced.\n\nOne is this: starting in 1970, the speed of technological advancement is such that communities cannot build, around them, an appropriate culture and ethics in managing them. This creates collective stress in local communities. They are, however, marginalized from them, because technology\u2019s governance happens at, and for, the global scale.\n\nAnother: as we know, our civilization is not sustainable as far as the consumption of resources is concerned.\n\nAnd a third: financial power is more and more global, democratic systems have stayed local and are displaced.\n\nGiven this context, our foundation is experimenting on new paradigms for governance, the economy etc. Our key concept is that of limit. Our key resource is what we call human development. This happens by interlinking closely the productive, cultural and welfare system. To do that, we bring to bear the territory capabilities. Part of this is talent attraction.\n\nMore specifically, we are experimenting with models that constrain the logic of profit maximization. The constraints:\n\n1. Expand freedom, especially that of the weakest\n2. Build social capital\n3. Protect ecosystems\n4. Supply beauty.\u201d\n\n### Learnings?\n\nThe Messina experience is very rich. We are trying to establish a strategic partnership with them, but that has slowed because of COVID-19. One fairly obvious learning: to act effectively, change permanently the incentives to which players on the ground. \u201cOur foundation provides economic resources to this territory, But it never funds projects: it funds permanent policies. Its pillars:\n\n1. Promote cooperative social and economic systems, which are very biodiverse. They have culture, finance, scientific research etc. These systems need to be able to promote alternatives in the areas of working, housing, socializing and learning.\n2. Reinterpret welfare towards personalized paths actively supporting each beneficiary in recognizing the alternatives generated by the system, and thus increase its freedom.\u201d\n\n### Link to our DD How does X relate to our areas of action? What new areas of exploration might this open? What area of exploration is this part of?\n\nDifferent components of the cluster address different AoAs. For example, FCM itself is about resetting the rules of the game through policy. FHO more about spinning new narratives, with the mystique of the Mediterranean as a koin\u00e9 of commerce, knowledge and peace. ECOSMED took the lead on reforming notions of value.\n\nWe submit that the Messina cluster *is* a deep demonstration of long-termism. It is a micro-economy that thinks very long-term, and is able to survive, and even thrive, in a context of alien, even hostile macro-systems.", "created_at": "2020-11-25 13:57:10.308622", "updated_at": "2020-11-25 13:57:10.308622", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1158, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 102.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6407, 6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63920, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11464, "post_number": 8, "raw": "@akenyg, this sounds great!

What do you feel necessary from EU to participate?**\n\n\nI\u2019m a bit skeptical that legislation is the right instrument to do this kind of things. It\u2019s a blunt instrument, because as of now there is no good understanding of the process from the ethical values (fairly easy to encode in a directive) to the actual technical choices of the scientists and engineers building AI systems. Ex. we like the New Zealand group developing Scuttlebutt: when users asked for cross-device accounts, the core developer replied \u201cI\u2019m not doing that, because we want to serve underprivileged people, and these people do not have multiple devices\u201d.

What should the EU do practically?**\n\nclimate + competition policy = nobody is allowed to grow to much. What is \u201cempowering\u201d? I suspect that AI (ML applied on big data) is inherently NOT human-centric, because its models (for example a recommendation algo) encode each human into a database, and then models you in terms of who you are similar to: for example, a woman between 35 and 45 who speaks Dutch and watches stand-up comedy on Netflix. Everything not standardizable, everything that makes you you, gets pushed to the error term of the model. That is hardly human-centric, because it leads to optimizing systems in terms of abstract \u201ctypical humans\u201d or \u201ctarget groups\u201d or whatever.\n\n\n**Can we think of counterproductive regulation on the Internet?

I am also keeping myself busy doing several activities on the side. \n\nIt has been 4 years now since I started to make workshops to make toys out of trash. These workshops are mainly for kids, but sometimes for adults as well, and sometimes, in the end, we make a theatrical play with our toys or marionettes. ( after several trials I stopped doing the play and focused on making toys with kids as they can represent themselves doing  whatever toy they want, besides this method requires less time ) \n\nI have done these workshops in several places, 3 in Cairo - one for adults-, one in New Delhi India, one in Bogota Colombia and one in Nabq protected area in Sinai Egypt. (this place is entirely closed due to security reasons ) \n(In Colombia I was working as in a pharmaceutical company and in weekends I was volunteering in an NGO with the purpose of democratizing art. In India, I was personally contacted an NGO that helped me with issuing the visa, and so on ) \n\nWhile I was studying at university, I was also volunteering in Kafr Ghatati development project, we were trying to build a model for community development there, we also believed in specializations so we tried to bring the experts in every field, there I didn\u2019t do any workshops but I was responsible for the health and children program. \n\nI started to learn about the world of making toys and marionettes while I was still studying at the faculty of pharmacy and I joined a workshop to learn how to make a marionette, this workshop was very long and expensive but I enjoyed it and learned a lot from it. Then I participated in an environmental conference in China, and there I saw a lot of recycling techniques. Started mixing both together and started giving upcycling workshops to make marionettes; It was for profit at first, then after seeing the passion in the children's eyes decided to do it not for profit. ( I did only 2 for profit workshops). Even the one workshop I did in Colombia no money was used at all ( all the colors and sticking materials were self-made or we used old stuff that people donated or didn\u2019t use ) \n\nThe products that the children make are always different but somehow have something in common; comparing the results always surprises me. For example; the workshop I did in Sinai the children draw normal houses like the ones in cities or \u201cTv\u201d which is not really suitable to their living environment and when asked if they see cartoons or movies they said they don\u2019t watch tv; this makes me want to understand more why and gives me the motive to go to other remote communities and compare the results. ( I want to visit more Indigenous communities and explore more, there is one community in Colombia living in the desert having a mix between African and latin America, also want to visit some communities in Tanzania and Kongo ) \n\nOne of the places I visited was this Nabq protected area in Sinai.\n\nThe place is on the borders, very near to the Tiran and Sanafir islands, it is an environmentally protected area and therefore The ministry of environment is responsible for the place, but it seems that an investor had bought the land - or whatever-, which makes it really hard to get into it and so the economy is based on fishing rather than tourism like most of the nearby places. The men get the fishes and go to sell it in Sharm El-Sheikh but the women and children don\u2019t have any connection with the \u201coutside world\u201d they rarely go out of Nabq. \nI was there camping, it was a camp with environmental goals like cleaning the beaches and so on, and entering was not easy even after having all the required permits from the Ministry of Environment. There we arranged with a nomadic community leader from the local community and discussed the idea of making a workshop for the kids, he was reluctant at first but then he accepted, without enthusiasm; even though he was watching the process and was enjoying it even by the end he let his wife to personally thank me and this was a big deal for me.  \n\nThe workshops differ depending on the place and the number of children involved. Can span for 3 days or can only be one and a half hours( like the one in Sinai ) \n\nThe workshops I do are always via other institutions or organizations ( in Egypt for example I was working under the umbrella of Alwan we Awtar, or even a tourism company whatever works ) and always with some volunteers from these organizations. The only one I had no volunteers was in India and we, the children and me, had no common language but it worked some how and had successful outputs. \n\nI start the workshop by showing the children a picture or two for toys done by other children ( usually I don\u2019t show them a lot of pictures in order to let them go wild and think themselves so as not to do the same as in the pictures ) even in Sinai I didn\u2019t have any pictures I just talked with them about what they can do and let them go. Then I ask them to draw what they want to make, Next step is to analyze together these drawings and break them down to see how we can make them using whatever is there in their environment. Finally, we build them together. \nChildren are always more creative and more daring to try and fail more than adults and they come up with ideas better than the ones I have in mind. I always leave them to try and don\u2019t force them to work with whatever methods and they even come up with ideas that at the beginning I think it won't work but in the end they make it work and come up with creative solutions. \n\n\nCurrently, along with my day work, I am studying a lot Humanitarian medical logistics and learning Spanish. Moreover I am planning to study ( disaster management ), as I am aiming at changing my job and location, hoping with the experience I have from my work and my degree I can apply to volunteer in programs like the UN program which could allow me to travel more and then I can disseminate these workshops again on the side in different places.\n\n[text-direction=rtl]\n\u0627\u0646\u0627

( dante :1st msg)</b>\n\nSo much in those two comments Dante! Lets elaborate as to what this could mean in more <strong>simple terms </strong>of practice.\n\nFirst of all, it appears that what you propose could form an important thread in the <strong>'collaborative communities'</strong> thread. ( Pavlik Elf ) With many community oriented groups forming now there is room for massive development in this area, especially where that development enhances\u00a0<strong>community cooperative development</strong>.\n\nAnother example to fit with the Marinelda scenario you depict above:\n\nWhere organic growers and producers form networks you have a basis for working and living (WOOFing) situations that allow for coordinated project development that is local community specific. In such networks there will appear ecovillage and OSE settlement projects and others like them. With the <strong>appropriate exchange systems</strong> in place this encourages a<strong> nomadic</strong> and highly practical and collaborative approach to<strong> localized distributed sustainable and\u00a0ecological development</strong> that can reduce depedency on euros via the kind of coupon system you suggest. Members of participative networks being able to trade 'digital value-tokens' for goods and services within these networks.\n\nOn this basis a lot of time and creativity is freed up, aswell as space in which that can flourish. There is <strong>somewhere to go, food, shelter, and collaborators</strong> to move the participating\u00a0phyles forward.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Mapping is Essential</strong>: what kind of spaces-can facilitate what kind of events under \u00a0 <span>\u00a0what conditions? Then\u00a0these spaces can host other events that would otherwise have poured value into the consumer economy.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>dante : you use the term: \"</span><span>not for profit\u00a0mutual support / investment approach \"</span><span>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Is this akin to\u00a0a form of <em>equity crowd-investment\u00a0</em>? Do you mean that a network (for example ER), finding a viable mode of production, say 'organic shitake mushroom farming', and the people and place to do it, could equity crowd-fund the project, therefore owning a certain amount of the 'entity' which translates into a reduction on the price of that good for members of the community/phyle/commons...?\n\nIf so I would like to add the use of label-creation. Like the 'certified Organic' label, but specifically in relation to affilitated\u00a0commons oriented networks. How to go about this would be something that requires mass participation of networks sharing this\u00a0vision.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-27 15:55:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:40.442592", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 490, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55494, "user_id": 5144, "topic_id": 10017, "post_number": 21, "raw": "[quote=\"MariaEuler, post:20, topic:10017\"]\nMaybe you could share some examples and ideas to discuss and ask others here concretely to do the same, or, what I think could be even more interesting you could formulate a call for intuitive social UX proposals or a workshop.\n[/quote]\n\nI absolutely CAN share something.

Maybe I am wrong, but, as far as I know it, the Food-Commons approach is mostly an umbrella-term to give coherence to very diverse experiences. I think we need to learn more from experiences and practices, to find an appropriate conceptual synthesis that is effective in political action. My curiosity is: in terms of agricultural practices (agroecology etc.), food processing practices (localisation etc.), and distribution practices (sharing, GAS) what is the added value of the Commons approach compared to the one of \"Food Sovereignty\" movements in the 1990s and 2000s?\nThe revival of Commons theory is not uniform and this may be a strength in analytical terms. But at this stage, that does not help in communication. And a manifesto is mostly about communication. This one, for instance, mixes up principles and actions and the levels are quite confused. Then, I cannot understand things like being against \"industrial systems\" and then promoting \"organic\" (point 5). The organic sector is an industrial system.\nThe manifesto is focused on food availability and production more than food-as-a-system. As the CAP... I don't find a reference to eating habits and culture. The manifesto considers this aspect implicit but I find that food as a shared culture is a pre-condition for any \"commonisation\". No reference to food quality (I intend an approach to quality able to break up the \"quality as safety\" and \"quality as uniqueness\" monopolies), and diversity. Education is mentioned by accident, just as a term of comparison. Weak references on how to involve not-producers (maybe just point 5 and 6).\n\nPoint 1: In 2000s and 2010s, many countries in the world put food as a human and universal right into Constitutions (considering it as an entitlement). Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, South Africa... have been the least able to resolve the imbalances of their food system since the declarations. If you think that this recognition is a game-changer in the EU (1st Point in the manifesto is an important position), then, why asking for a generic EP \"declaration\" (maybe meaning a resolution?) instead of proposing to change the EU Treaties?\nPoint 2: whence and why those numbers? I can't understand the reference to Point 12 for clarification - potential contradiction \"XX% of private sector\" and \"no speculation\" point 11.\nPoint 3: An ECI on the same goal as point 1 - an ECI would be much more stimulating. Launching, making the ECI approved by the EU and winning 1mln signatures would oblige the European Commission to respond. Imagine if the EC starts a real dialogue on that. Politicians go (EP), bureaucracy (EC) stays. Maybe a better result than a political declaration. IMHO.\nPoint 4: The CAP framework - unfortunately - is not that of a \"food system policy.\" This is fixed in the EU Treaties (another reason why the call for a Treaty change makes sense). Yet, some tools are available. Rural Development Policy (the so-called 2nd pillar of the CAP) is decentralized and has interesting opportunities (if States want to activate the measures) for short supply chains, in-situ conservation of non-commercial plant and animal varieties, citizen participation (LAGs). In that context, one could think about concrete ways for fulfilling point 14, for example, if any interest in incremental change. But also this aspect is not clear.\n\nI could go ahead, but to cut it short: I find principles exposed in points 10 and 13 sufficiently clear to agree.\n\nHope I answered", "created_at": "2020-10-19 06:57:56", "updated_at": "2020-10-19 14:41:51.358869", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 593, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 22.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85098], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65399, "user_id": 5781, "topic_id": 11803, "post_number": 1, "raw": "(Instructions: https://edgeryders.eu/t/11570 )\n\n**Name of the event:** \n\n**Question 1/3: Who\u2019s talking?** Ask the person who is speaking right now what their name is, and if they already have an edgeryders account?

Or does the difference in governance and motivation make all the difference?\n\nI think Wikipedia is a rather interesting example - and not necessarily a purely positive one. But first - those 40 million is the number of total accounts. Actually [actively editing users are more around 126.000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians), so significantly less. (And actually on par with Mastodon or Diaspora).\n\nNow, why is Wikipedia an interesting example? For one because of the discrepancy of who edits and who consumes it. There are [over 800 million different devices](https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/en.wikipedia.org) accessing it each month, but only126k editing and maintaining it. [Active Editors are actually about 40.000 only](https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/en.wikipedia.org/contributing/active-editors/normal|line|2-year|~total|monthly).\n\nNow, why is it that only a fraction of a percent are actually maintaining it?\n\nI suspect several reasons:\n* editing is hard and unrewarding\n* the existing community makes it hard for new people to join, putting up layers of bureaucracy (this is especially true for the German Wikipedia, but I've talked to a Wikipedian from Hong Kong and they confirmed the same issue)\n* Generally there is a discrepancy between consuming and maintaining\n\nThe other interesting thing is that Wikipedia has, as you pointed out, effectively killed traditional encyclopedias. And I am not too sure how much of a good thing this is. It does self-govern itself quite effectively in that it is stable. But it is also frighteningly good at resisting *any* kind of change. Which is good if you see it as \"protecting against outside influence\", but very bad if viewed as \"maintaining the status quo of those in power\".\n\nBut regardless of that - I do not think that Wikipedia is a fitting example of \"this is large and still working\", because in terms of people actively working on it, it is not particularly large. In fact, it has obviously managed to _not_ grow over a certain active user threshold, and it does in fact not work as a large scale community.", "created_at": "2020-08-27 19:09:22.482915", "updated_at": "2020-08-27 19:09:58.210787", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 389, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [82428], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62369, "user_id": 4779, "topic_id": 11247, "post_number": 3, "raw": "D\u00edky moc za p\u0159\u00edsp\u011bvek, kter\u00fd otev\u0159en\u011b otev\u00edr\u00e1 to, o \u010dem my, kte\u0159\u00ed v Praze nepodnik\u00e1me vlastn\u011b jenom tu\u0161\u00edme.

The key thing is you need to do an inspiring and generative presentation of what <em>you</em> or others are working on, and it is better if the work actually is relevant and engaging to the individuals present, on a personal emotional level.\n\n1. Introduce the topic- tell a story. Edgeryders is particularly effective because it is about people like the people in the room experimenting with unconventional/novel ways to address the kinds of problems people in the room face or care about. With little or no resources most of the time.\n\n2. Get people to talk about what they care about, start them off discussing the contents of the presentation and relating to their own lives and work. Get people to write down observations or topics they are currently interested in or have noticed (one sentence questions or statements). Let them go on for a while till they have 3-4 statements/questions each. Get them to cluster the ones that \"feel like they belong together\" and label each cluster.\n\n3. Have people break off into groups by self selection around clusters, one group per cluster or if many people choose a cluster split it into two or more groups/cluster. Have them discuss what they could/would like to do assuming no one else is coming other than the people in the group and that the only resources available are discussants time and skills. Let this discussion go on for a while.\n\n4. Bring groups together in one big circle. End with collaboration mosaic (each person writes names of people they would turn to for help in a circle, then for each name you write qualities or skills or things they are especially good or unique at in an outer circle). Have people read their outer circles and then open floor to reflections and discussions about contents of the day, what was discussed what stuck out for them. Write follow up email asking people about their experiences and thoughts to post on the community platform.\n\nThat's all. You can pick many many different exercises for the steps involved but now you understand what you are trying to get at and can pick effectively.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-01 09:29:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:56.299837", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 409, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1564], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33494, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6493, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Ping @owen again.

But then, so are hierarchy (low productivity), consensus decision-making (near-zero productivity in fast-changing environments), representative democracy (adverse selection)...

Granted, for the reasons you mention and others that have nothing to do with rationality (rational agents can and do use rhetoric to obtain personal gains). But if you want to become a monk, you'll have to take the four vows of poverty, chastity, obedience and stability. That's hard too \u2013 in my book, a whole lot harder that accepting a slap on the wrist when you pull a straw man argument on your brother.

We start from assuming that <a href=\"http://secretofoursuccess.fas.harvard.edu/\">Henrich is right</a>. That is: we are a cultural species; natural selection drives both cultural and genetic adaptation of\u00a0<em>homo sapiens sapiens;\u00a0</em>humans are highly programmable through myelination into old age; and, critically, in the past 200,000 years or so natural selection exerted most of its pressure through group competition. In this scenario, humans self-domesticate: we enforce norms that help the success of the group. For example, even though infants are repelled by spicy food, all known warm-climate cultures encode the (learned) appreciation for capsicum etc. Spices have germicide properties, and help conserve meat. So, a warm-climate culture that learns to like spices is likely to outcompete one that does not.\u00a0\n\nSo, you see: do-ocracy is, I argue, highly functional and rewarding...\u00a0<em>for do-ocrats,</em>\u00a0i.e. people that have internalised this way of working. Other people will internalise other ways of working (say, decision by consensus) and will form other groups that work by the consensus protocol. This is OK. IN fact, Benedict's Rule formalizes the \"revolving door\": it is easy to try monastic life, but it is also easy to leave it. This is inevitable because, as you pointed out, adopting the Rule is hard. So, individuals pick the group whose norms they like best. Then groups compete, and over time selection will pick the winners. A similar argument goes for renouncing rhetoric. \"It does not work for everybody\" is not a valid argument: in order to win out, a cultural innovation just needs (1) to get a foothold and (2) to give the adopting group an advantage. If both conditions are satisfied, it will win out, as losing groups will either adopt or die out. \u00a0<img alt=\"smiley\" height=\"23\" src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png\" title=\"smiley\" width=\"23\">\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-05 19:02:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.347587", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 543, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30168], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33340, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6494, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>A note on \"reading\" the links</b>\n\n@Noemi | @Amelia I just wanted to flag that, when you have different types of entities in the same graph, the\u00a0interpretation\u00a0of the link has to be factored back in. When we use the code co-occurrence graph, we know that every single link means \"this code co-occurs somewhere with this other code\". So we can look at a global pattern of connectivity, where information flows transitively:\u00a0\"A co-occurs with B that co-occurs with C\" Code C is still associated to A, though not as closely as B is.\n\nWhen you move to these other type of networks, different links have different meanings: \"A is author of B that encodes the code C\". It's not immediately clear anymore what the relationship between author A and code C is. Could C represent an \"interest\" of A? Maybe.\u00a0But there is no link that directly means \"is-interested-in\". You could make one up, and induce a new network: but,\u00a0in general,\u00a0transitivity is lost.\u00a0\n\nJason and Guy, they are not so invested in the interpretation as you are. Network scientists look at graphs as mathematical objects. They are fascinated as much by their intrinsic properties as by what they can tell us about the reality they describe. In fact, graph theory was invented as a pure math branch in the 18th century; only in the 1950s did Moreno and the sociometrists get the intuition of deploying it in the service of studying human relationships.\u00a0\n\nSo: \"ace\" graphs, as Amelia says, but make sure you check, at each step, what each link actually means.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-20 09:00:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:03.512173", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 290, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33338], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39504, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5946, "post_number": 2, "raw": "hey @Geminiimatt remembered I had these notes from your session at Mozfest in case you ever need them.", "created_at": "2017-11-17 21:12:29.537343", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 21:12:29.537343", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 26.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4132], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33351, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6494, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Connected story: worth including?</b>\n\nHm, there is another story following the one on Cosmus: Backpacks for refugees: https://edgeryders.eu/node/6926\n\nYou probably didnt mark it connection made on site because this post was authored a week after the first - complementing\u00a0same broad story.\n\nIt is there where the connection between Alex and Aravella unfolded too - with a clearer marker for action:\n\n\"<em>2) Aravella: @Alex Levene when will you visit Greece?

We make a hypothesis on the basis of the graph, confirmed by reading the conversation. Many people blocked by regulation trying to do something beneficial, but there is also a recognition of the issue of safety - this contradiction plays out in sophisticated ways in the OpenCare community. The way you dig deeper into this is by reading the text, but at a higher level you can already read it in the graph.\n\n**Amelia**: You couldn\u2019t read all the stories, there are too many. Graphryder enables you to pick out the stories, and dig deeper. \n\nStart with the tag view. For example: I\u2019m interested in 'policy'.\n\n**One of the things I\u2019m noticing** is there is an interesting link between policy and existing system failure:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f2c4eb770b234666f5cf7b3ce7fc84abcced3dcb.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"485\">\n\nIf I were a mental health professional, I could look at all the related topics. For example: mental health and creativity - what\u2019s going on between the two, that might not be clear? I might not know the link between the two, but Graphryder provides a link between the two that exists. People feel they have more mental health concerns when they are in creative professions.\n\nNow we get an overview of content that relates to both of these issues.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/03b4c90b7a14bce81566b729f999f8674e938430.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"379\">\n\n3000+ contributions in all on Edgeryders, very hard to filter through - Graphryder gives us an ethnological perspective: I would miss some of these connections if I didn\u2019t get this zoomed out view - instead of relying on individual memory, I can see how strong the link between these different concepts are, that I may not have known about.\n\nLooking at the graph - there\u2019s a crucial link with safety and system failure - even though legal frameworks get in the way of DIY initiatives, there are existing regulatory frameworks to work within, which from an anthropological point of view is interesting.\n\nThe **tag** view is really useful for seeing relations between nodes. By digging into care we can find a different angle of discussion on health, the design interventions node points us to smartphone based healthcare apps:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7364d4d67c41d43c30547c01a65832f48a00e3bd.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"456\">\n\nThere are three different views: one for users, one for content, one for tags. \n\nThe **Detangler** view lets you see the intensity of the conversation around subjects.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6ee45f36ed418307693c89eaf087844ab96d0983.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"415\">\n\n**Alberto**: Benefit to local network analysis in ethnography - my instinct is to try and get information on the network as a whole - that\u2019s what humans can\u2019t do. Anyone can keep track of a local track of ten nodes or so - what is unique is the global connectivity pattern - a pretty close call for collective intelligence. My problem with the detangler view: hints at regularities, but stops ahead of the finishing line, which would be to say, these connections between nodes correspond to a social network, then you compute the social network metrics which has something to say about the connectivity.

I've gone through your posts and links and your reply to @markomanka clears up some of the confusion he brought up. Yet I want to summarize to see if I understand correctly since I'm no expert at all. It became a bit of a long post.\n\nI understand a business model as the mechanism by which someone generates value and is compensated when they exchange it with someone. In my mind there's several elements to this mechanism (tell me if it doesn't make sense):\n\n- _The value (food, education, housing, ...)_\n- _The way of generating value (for the food example: allowing people to grow and pick their own vegetables, growing vegetables for people, ...)_\n- _Who you are providing the value to (a company, a citizen, children, refugees, ...)_\n- **The compensation (money, in kind, credit, equity, intangible benefits such as more equality, ...)**\n- **The way of compensation (buying, pay-per-use, renting, STR, ...)**\n\nWhat I gather from what you wrote is are changes in the last two elements in bold, let's call them **instruments and agreements** (correct me if I'm wrong). And that these would enable new ways of doing the elements in italic, let's call them the _value proposition_ (according to @markomanka , if I'm correct in the use here). Like the example you gave of artists: they would be able to create cultural value (execute their value proposition), because they are individuals in a Guarantee Society (new agreement &amp; instrument). This enables either an established value proposition as a starting point, or would enable the artist to experiment with a new value proposition (with risk sharing through the default pool).\n<br>\nAs somewhat of a pragmatist in trying to sustain a shared community space, I have to look from the side of new value propositions. Can we come up with new value, ways of generating value and find new target audiences? Within the standard instruments &amp; agreements: using money and selling or renting.\n\nExample: we develop and provide free education for underprivileged children through workshops (free). The educational content we developed is adapted to the formal education system through another series of workshops (material costs covered). Then we train teachers to use the material in the classroom (paid gig + profits to reinvest). Ultimately we sell our services as consultants and trainers in science communication (paid + profits to reinvest). We're aiming for a balance between all of them and are banking on the collective know how we build up.\n\nFiguring this out and implementing it is hard work: market research, mastering a skill and trade, finding partners, team collaboration, admin, ... And that for each of the steps described. Moreover, they have a clear time element: there is no shortcut for the learning curve of the people involved and there's simply only 24 hours in a day to do all the work.\n\nAlthough the implementation of new agreements and instruments is easier in a new project (no legacy of habits and outdated worldviews of key people), they usually don't have the time or resources to do that (let alone having enough time for their value proposition). And from experience, actions must have an advantage that increases chances of survival in the short term. The costs and risks are too high otherwise. You are often screwing yourself if you do not use the readily available agreements and instruments.\n\nThose who do have the means to try to implement new agreements and instruments, usually keep looking at the short term anyway, or they don't have it specifically on their mind, or it is a watered down version that comes back to short term benefits. Like big financial institutions trying to adopt blockchain these days.\n<br>\nTherefore I think focussing the business model narrative on agreements and instruments is not representative of reality. Value proposition plays a bigger role in my view. I'm taking the perspective of a new or struggling project, as these are the majority of the projects I'm in touch with. They are usually also those taking the longest shots at change.\n\nThe cool thing about the design you describe is that a collective of established business/organisations/individuals would be able to carry the risks involved for new or struggling projects adopting new agreements and instruments. Moreover they have incentive to provide know how, network and help in implementing it. Benefits also go both ways, in terms of diversity and room for experimentation. \n\nThe advantages are many. It's being attempted with various mechanisms and varying success, see eg. [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com/) and [Transforma Bxl](https://www.transformabxl.be/) or [Civic Innovation Network](https://civicinnovation.network/site/). \n\nVarying success, because it is not an easy thing to implement: bringing together parties, setting rules, navigating obstacles, ... It also has to come as an initiative of a party willing to invest time and resources for the unavoidable coordination costs, at a considerable risk of failure. Those who are aware, willing and capable are rare. Thus the fertile ground (or market opportunity) for third party services facilitating such a network, is not really there yet I think.\n\nIn conclusion, I think there is an order to things. To me, it makes sense to start with the value proposition and then evolve towards adopting new agreements &amp; instruments when the capacity is there, after bridging a risky startup period.\n\nMy two cents, as someone that has been involved in failed attempts at setting up such a network from the perspective of a new project.

I feel the open village festival is calling me :-) I shall have a little look at the links you have sent me as well as take a tour through some of the interesting comments and reflections people have made. \n\nWe were fairly resource poor in terms of medical equipment and medical supplies. Pharmaceuticals were relatively easy to get out hands on, we relied heavily on donations of gloves, swabs, betadiene, tape, scissors, sterile fields and other small practical equipment from visiting healthcare providers from nearby Spain and Italy. They were sporadic, but on reflection it would have been very difficult without them or at the very least very expensive trying to source them over the counter. Unfortunately the whole area was destroyed and the migrants were gathered up and packed off to camps! :( the clinic was also bulldozed. It would be interesting to hear if any one had any bright idea about supply chains and resource/ equipment management in these \"pop up\" type clinics. I know @michael_dunn is doing so work on emergency mutual aid of which supply chains may be a small but important feature.  \n\nI also really liked the Health Autonomy at the End of the World, written by @woodbinehealth. They paint a rather bleak picture of the breakdown and cut backs in healthcare structures within America. I whole heartedly agree that we need greater health autonomy for the individual and population at large.

I do know that I have broken laws during my days as an activist and so can relate to the idea of a law seeming to not only be on the wrong side of citizens but also the environment or commons. My uninformed sense is that this would be both an issue of law and interpretation by the courts - especially given the larger reality that the people who hold positions of power in courts will come from backgrounds of privilege and therefore likely to interpret things within their frame of reference. In a recent conversation with @matteo describing the work taking place for OpenCare in the City of Milan, he mentioned the disconnect between the legislators and the legislated and so whether intentional or otherwise I can imagine this would contribute to the drafting of laws and legislation that would therefore be on the wrong side of citizen protection. \nAs discussed during our conversation @markomanka, I would be interested in working on a chapter as a 'contribution from the edges' that picks up on the learning from bottom up forms of care.

Then, it came the time to present the first insight of the research as experience and explaining how I have started combining and giving meaning to data collected on the field. A matrix about online/offline and design/making practices has been helpful to map the different and many practices enacted by the staff involved in opencare at WeMake. Such practices happen mostly in a hybrid integrated space of physical and digital actions, where applications and software are implied in the pursuit of tasks. Some members of the staff work sometimes remotely and videoconferencing is rather a common practice. Although WeMake workplace is definitely a technological environment, the human element seems still important in finding mistakes or re-schedule and re-arrange things to be done.\nInteresting questions were asked about the research and the involvement of WeMake in the opencare project.\n\nA second part of the presentation was scheduled about working in groups on the published elements (pictures, sounds and notes). Anyway, a change of the program happened spontaneously given the matter of the meeting: understanding how daily morbid living is being changed in and by WeMake practices. Maker in residence and Openrampette were mentioned as having an important part in the development of the qualitative data of the research given their experimental and participative design parts.\n\nThereafter, the participants started an interesting discussion about the role of maker spaces in redefining the concept of care in different sets and social worlds.

It is an end-to-end payment system via Paypal that you can embed on any website (now even on your Facebook page, though I have not tried Facebook yet). I used it to make it easier for the readers of my blog to buy my book. I did sell some (mind you, my blog has 100 visits a day, so not a lot of traffic there). This is what the embed looks like:\n\n<script>var blommingCustom223 = {  height: 360, width: 480 , lng: 'en',  button_text: 'Buy Wikicrazia',  button_only: false,  theme_selected: 'dark_blue',  end :1} </script><!-- Start of Blomming Embed -->\n\n<div class=\"blomming-product\" data=\"user:albertocottica;item:223\">\u00a0</div><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\nvar blommingJsHost = \"blomming.com\";\n\nvar blommingJsProtocol = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://\" : \"http://\");\n\nvar blommingJsUrl = blommingJsProtocol + blommingJsHost;\n\ndocument.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + blommingJsUrl + \"/widget/scripts/widget.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\"));\n\n</script><noscript><a href=\"http://blomming.com/mm/albertocottica/items/wikicrazia\">Wikicrazia</a></noscript><!-- End of Blomming Embed -->What I like about it is that it makes e-commerce very personal.

You should receive the book within 3-4 days, if you don't get it get in touch me and I will call the publisher and see what I can do.\" It is a great way to build a strong vendor-customer relationship. Unsurprisingly, the (quite large) Blomming community consists mostrly of craftpersons like yourself.\n\nThey have also an <a href=\"http://blomming.com/buy\">online store</a> were vendors have virtual shops, of course, but also anyone (vendors or buyers) can create collections of objects from different vendors (I like <a href=\"http://blomming.com/items/search?caw_id=86&amp;order=created_at_desc\">this one</a> inspired from the Victorian age).\u00a0 The software aggregates everything: all orders, whether from your blog, your Facebook, somebody else's website or the Blomming online store, go to the same database and are managed through your dashboard.

It is estimated that worldwide over 508,000 women died in 2011 from breast cancer (Global Health Estimates, WHO 2013). This represents about 12% of all new cancer cases and 25% of all cancers in women.\n\nIn all countries, early detection remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control in order to improve breast cancer outcome and survival. In health systems with developed infrastructure, physicians regularly examine the breast as part of a routine female check-up (usually once or twice a year) in addition to mammography. However, this routine procedure is \u00a0provided at varying levels of time investment and care.\n\nDiscovering hands has a number of advantages:\n\nBy using the extraordinary sensory capabilities of visually impaired women, a perceived \u201cdisability\u201d is transformed into a capability. A completely new field of meaningful employment is created.\n\n\u201cMedical Tactile Examiners\u201d (MTEs) are trained to deliver physical breast examinations at doctors\u2019 practices. During a 9-month training period they learn how to use a standardized diagnostic method for examining the female breast. Additionally, all MTEs are trained in communication skills and breast-specific psychology, as well as administrative tasks typically carried out by a doctor\u2019s assistant. MTEs are either directly employed by resident doctors or hospitals, or they work for different practices and/or hospitals on a freelance basis.\n\nConventionally, a regular breast examination carried out by a gynecologist takes between 1 and 3 minutes. The discovering hands MTE invests at least 30 minutes for each session, not only examining the breast, but also educating patients on how to cope with the risk of breast cancer. Patients feel that they are well taken care of and receive the best possible preventive examination in a pleasant environment.\n\nPreliminary qualitative results, conducted by the University of Essen, show that MTEs detect ~50% more and ~28% smaller tissue alterations in the breast than doctors (5-8mm vs. 10-15mm). A clinical, peer reviewed study is currently being conducted at the University of Erlangen.\n\n<strong>Our vision</strong>\n\nWe are operating as a social business because we believe in the our value proposition (to the healthcare sector, and institutions supporting people with disabilities). We are committed to the social \"win-win\" of our model: offering meaningful employment to blind women, and creating an opportunity for them where they have competitive strength; and helping to improve the breast cancer early identification situation and awareness for the most common cancer among women.\n\n<strong>Current roll-out</strong>\n\nDiscovering hands is planning to substantially increase the number of MTEs in the years to come. We currently operate in Germany and in Austria. In both India and Colombia we have pilot projects running with scale-up in planning. And we are interested in further country roll-out, which we operate through a social franchise.\n\nIf you are a social entrepreneur and would like to implement discovering hands in your country, contact us. Also, if you are an impact investor and are interested in collaborating with us to further roll-out the model, please contact us too. We are interested in hearing from you!\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.discovering-hands.de/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.discovering-hands.de</a></li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2016-09-26 12:07:24", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 03:45:50.495282", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 585, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74482, "user_id": 4683, "topic_id": 12845, "post_number": 12, "raw": "A fairy-tale about numbers & behaviour (in six languages):\nhttps://ukkoelhob.blogspot.com/2020/03/the-soap-boiler-and-coronavirus.html\n\np.s.

The first thing should be self-explanatory, the latter is not exactly an improvement but an evolutionary step. Social Media encompasses a range of different communication and community models. I call that the [bedroom-to-broadcast scale](https://darcy.is/the-bedroom-to-broadcast-scale-of-communication-spaces/).\n\nThe problem is that most if not all social media platforms treat all these spaces basically the same, giving us the same toolsets. And that doesn't work. Moderation and policy guidelines that are supposed to make a nice and kid-friendly TV broadcast cannot apply to that sort-of-but-not-quite-private conversation at the pub.\n\nWhat we set out to do is to give people an idea of what kind of space they are talking in, and give them tools to cope when a conversation is suddenly exposed to a more public space than initially intended. On top of that, we make every effort to include an as diverse as possible range of people and their different threat models. If you have a stalker, you need to lock down your online presence in a different way than if you are an LGTBQ* person living in an oppressive regime.\n\nThe result should hopefully be a true global civic space, where people can reach out to humans everywhere, but also have the local communities.

However, as with most things, this went way too far...some \"news\" pages now actually have 100's of ads on them (CNN, for example). Hundreds! The targeting worked better when it was done in a subtle or general fashion. Now, it's so blatantly obvious and hides the good stuff...that it would seem to lose some of the effect (perhaps I am looking a bit in to the future here). \nI can almost start to say that the web was more useful in 1998 than it is today...when google results are now page after page of \"content farms\" or \"SEO\" stuff designed to have the sizzle (results that look good in a list) but no steak once you get to the site. \nOne would think a smart company like Google would see this - and perhaps they do, but they have pressure to keep the bucks flowing. \nI should mention that I attended in-person google seminars when I was a publisher and they showed us \"heat maps\" of pages, which is where we should put ads. But, even then, I think google TOS allowed no more than two or three ads per page.\nJust thinking out loud here - but billboards are allowed on highways...however, if advertisers put one every 50 meters and they were all moving and colorful to grab your attention, laws and regulation would be passed or the industry asked to regulate itself so that the purpose of the highway remained sound. This may be part of the solution in some places - make the internet \"the highway\" and tell publishers over a certain size that they have to choose....X amounts of ads per page or % of page with ads, etc. \nBut ads are not the only problem - it's the fight for eyeballs which has resulted in so many entire web sites being created for nothing except drawing people in. That part is up to the search engines. It may just happen that duck duck or another SE gets there first - and there is nothing to say that people will not gravitate to the ad-free or limited ad (or limited \"content farm\" results) search engine. \nAnyway, that part is not exactly Social Media related but it is thoughts on the fact that the Internet IS broken and fixes are needed.\nIt would be truly amazing to see how google reacts if, for example, 10% of search queries started going to duck duck or a similar service.", "created_at": "2019-08-20 12:10:18.292294", "updated_at": "2019-08-20 12:10:18.292294", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 440, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 53.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41340, "user_id": 3791, "topic_id": 3997, "post_number": 3, "raw": "okay", "created_at": "2018-01-20 02:14:15.614120", "updated_at": "2018-01-20 02:14:15.614120", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 45.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [41339], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38399, "user_id": 4103, "topic_id": 6549, "post_number": 12, "raw": "whow !

It is as well a matter of structural funding and bargaining power.. and accessibility to quality food not solely for the most affluent (see the [nutrients collapse](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511/) since the 1950s in almost all foods).  I think the neo-rurals in general often start with a different model in mind, if I recall well 10% of new peasants in France for instance start from scratch (not from inherited land) and do not want to reproduce the mistakes of past generations submerged by debt, monoculture crops and efficiency ratios. [Terre de liens](https://terredeliens.org/), a French association functioning as a community trust for farms, facilitates access to the land & tightens use of the land to agroecological practices. Since 2016 they managed to preserve in this way 6400 ha that would have otherwise ended up in urban concreting or big agribusiness hands.\n\n> But in my opinion, it rests on the image of the farmer we now have, an ageing population and less younger people in rural areas. What is this mix role that you are talking about, how did you come to this idea ?\n\nOn the idea of being closer to the land I'm rather thinking about my own experience as I would love to be more connected to nature as a youngish :smiley: and never-been-farmer  urban, meaning rather spending systemically more time in rural areas while not giving up urban life. \nThis doesn't mean that I should just move to a smaller city or to a peripheral suburban area looking at my kitchen garden and cows ruminating from my window :sweat_smile: I'm rather pointing at the possibility of suburban citizens to actively participate and more profoundly be aware of the food chains that support our (urban) livelihoods. \nI'm thinking for instance about seasonal work that could be taken over by workers in the city (see btw what happened with [desbrasdansnosassiette](https://desbraspourtonassiette.wizi.farm/) during the spring lockdown) and how the city could be useful for rurals on the other hand, on top of our natural role of 'compost makers' which is still far from being accomplished in most cities (see [the latest report](https://issuu.com/urbanecologycentre/docs/20190613_phosphore_rapport_scientif) from 'operation phosphore' for Brussels). \n\nThis would mean that in the long run we should all make time for this kind of activities to happen in a more systematic way rather than solely relying on volunteering or on governments and private companies failing to take good care of our means of nourishment and ecosystems. It would mean as well rearranging our work time as 'fully-scheduled' service workers (although, of course, not all urban residents are service workers) and spending more time directly or indirectly taking care of commons, i.e. the soil at the basis of our own livelihoods. \nBasically we need more time for farming and it needs to concern more people as well in cities.\n\nParis, for instance, used to be almost entirely self-sustained within the Ile-de-France region. Le *mara\u00eecher*, which means vegetable grower / gardener in French, was actually named after the Parisian neighborhood 'Les Marais'. Paris was well known for its variety of crops and inventiveness in urban farming since the Middle Ages, see the fruit walls in Montreuil, etc.\n![image|690x529, 75%](upload://a6XVYDNEmGBEKuo8nGxxpti00Ld.jpeg) \nSource: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mur_%C3%A0_p%C3%AAches\nOr cultivation under bell jars\n![image|690x453, 75%](upload://tQYE36Dy4B8bdrKhOjjLBNljKYs.jpeg) \nSource: https://www.enlargeyourparis.fr/societe/quand-lalimentation-dessine-le-territoire-une-histoire-des-relations-entre-paris-et-sa-peripherie-agricole-depuis-le-moyen-age\nThese days the area around Paris produces solely 10% of veggies & fruits necessary for its population livelihood. In the 1900s it used to be 80%. Farmers in the region used to be 500k in 1900s, 88k in 1954 and 11k in 2010. Despite the disappearance of 'urban farming' isn't solely negative as it theoretically allows for more wild green areas (meadows, ponds, forests) which are necessary around and within a city.\n\nLong story short, I'm trying to imagine a sort of transition from being an urban 'knowledge worker' to a sort of a farmer/researcher that is able to contribute to small-scale farming nourishing the most diverse fellow citizens of my city.

But specifics differ, depending on who you ask. An important question is what we mean by \"letting people know\". For example, Edgeryders has a well thought-through [netiquette page](/t/45). It was re-written several times, and ultimately decided upon by @johncoate, the world's first-ever online community manager (at [The Well](https://www.well.com/), pre-Internet). It is accessible through a menu printed on top of every page. Have we let people know? How many people here are aware of that page? Not many, I'd wager. \n\nIn Edgeryders, this is not a big problem, because we model humans online as thinking adults. They own their words. They have a responsibility to be aware of what is considered excellent/good/acceptable/unacceptable behavior. The netiquette page is just there as a reference. We don't care if people have read it or not, they are still held to the same standards.\n\nMany people disagree with us. It seems to me that the Ix/Ux tradition, for example, was developed in a commercial context. Commercial companies model humans online rather as desire machines (thinking adults are tricky customers) and aim to gratify them. Though designers have amazing useful skills, I tend to be weary of the culture that spawned them. Paradoxically, this has come to influence my aesthetics: the abrasive, no-nonsense look of the [Mother### website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) inspires trust in me, whereas I instinctively mistrust anything too sleek. \n\nI guess what I am trying to say is \"social media is broken, let's *be* better!\".

An honest and responsive government was perceived as a precondition for creating such an enabling environment. (source: Georgian preliminary Post2015 consultations report provided by UNDP)\n\n<strong>In Edgeryders we are seeing how citizens \u2013 especially the younger ones \u2013 are active in creating their own initiatives and spaces that work with different kinds of procedures and practices than institutional politics</strong>. And that civic and political participation is not some activity or engagement separated from the rest of their lives: people can be involved as thoughtful consumers or boycotters; adopters of alternative currencies (sharing as opposed to buy-sell practices); users of particular digital tools (eg the free software movement) etc. These choices are in themselves political, yet they lie outside formalized, institutional spaces. That, too is civic participation (<a href=\"http://edgeryders.eu/making-sense-edgeryders-experiences-where-do-we-go-here/mission_case/we-people-reloaded\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">source</a>).\u00a0\n\nWe would like to know how you, your families, friends and acquaintances are dealing with this. We try to address the following challenges:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Responsive government</strong>. When the government is deeply engaged in a many-to-many dialogue with the citizenry, good things happen. Decision makers have access to high-quality information about what goes on; citizens and businesses can help prevent crises by giving government officials early warning. However, many government agencies are focused on their internal process, and find it difficult to change course quickly when citizens bring new information to the table.\u00a0<strong>How are you making your government (national or local) more responsive? Do you know of any initiative or project that is helping public sector agencies engage in open dialogue with citizens?</strong>\n</li>\n\n<li><strong>Citizen-institution interaction</strong>. In many democracies, traditional forms of participation are in deep crisis. Elections turnout is decreasing, especially among younger citizens [need data to support this]. Meanwhile, committed individuals are inventing new forms of participation, from critical consumption to interrogating government data to make sense of what is going on (open data).\u00a0<strong>How are you making your voice heard?

I have recently presented the success of a photovoice project at the Wellcome Trust International Engagement Workshop in Kenya 2017. I am actively seeking opportunities to test, collaborate and explore these methods and thematic areas with others.\u00a0\n\nI was looking for partners/collaborators in other countries for this specific project. I have however, decided to scale down the project and treat this as a testing phase with a large research component. In 2018 I'd like to scale the project to additional countries with collaborations across the countries. Any feedback would be wonderful.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-07 07:46:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:05.601421", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 185, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 8.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33772], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84794, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 14525, "post_number": 20, "raw": "On the basis of the doodle, for the majority this Thursday at 16h (CEST) would be an option, but missing answers from @Leonie @Jan @hugi - would that work for you?", "created_at": "2020-10-12 16:48:30.205863", "updated_at": "2020-10-12 16:48:30.205863", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 22.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [84661], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33782, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6579, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>All clear now.</b>\n\nNo worries, it's good to be sure anyway, and now that you're part of the community we'll make sure to spread the word and see where support can come from.

According to Ben, at the end of May we will have savings for 8K euro, which are enough to extend the prototype for 2 more months provided the city leaves us the building and keeps paying for electricity and connectivity.</li>\n\n<li>David might be willing to relocate the center production of the Viral Academy to unMonastery Matera. He would also be up for living himself in Matera for the duration of the project.</li>\n\n<li>Together with <a href=\"/u/ben\">@Ben</a>, <a href=\"/u/ritao\">@Rita O</a>\u00a0and Matera2019 we have decided to regroup unMonastery projects into three clusters (OpenTechSchool, Cultural Commoning, Sustainability Plan) and focus them on one particular neighborhood in Matera, called <a href=\"http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartieri_di_Matera\">Piccianello</a>. We would work together with the university to do some sort of Piccianello Open Day or something, using events as deliverables.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThese pave the way for the following scenario:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>we call up MT2019, ask for a meeting and tell them that we have the resources for keeping unMonastery Matera going to the end of the year, though in a mutated form. Are they up for extending our use of the building to the end of December, and keep paying the utility bills? It is going to be very hard for them to say no in the face of an investment of private resources from a foreign company. Since the VA is officially an Edgeryders project, it's simply a matter of extending our existing partnership agreement.</li>\n\n<li>we use unMonastery Matera as the venue for VA courses and as a place of residency. As part of the same narrative, we buy an open server and turn it over to the community with a ceremony, in the course of the Piccianello event. As part of the VA classes, we can deploy WordPress installations on that server for people in the community to host websites of local businesses for free. VA students/teachers can build those websites as part of the course.</li>\n\n<li>at this point, we have a building in stewardship for a year. In September Edgeryders is supposed to build a European event \u00a0on community-owned digital assets in Matera back-to-back with OSMIT14, the Italian OpenStreetMap community's meetup \u2013 so we build it at the unMonastery.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>and we might even push LOTE4 back to Matera, especially if Fabrizio Barca gets involved and finds us funded travel.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThis is a very attractive scenario, and very likely in the best interest of Edgeryders. Though the final decision is David's to make, we all might want to contemplate it. <a href=\"/u/arthurd\">@ArthurD</a>, would you be available to go through the VA's budget with David? The main purpose of the exercise is to figure out if the VA has some margin for putting two-three people (of which David would be one) in the building for the rest of the year, while making sure he can still deliver the project to Nominet. One hack might be to recruit teachers from the community and paying them \"in kind\" with an unMonastery residency.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-12 17:09:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:14.926727", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 587, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 15.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33741, "user_id": 3247, "topic_id": 6590, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Our last design challenge was \u201ehow might we help society to drop down social and environmental barriers, because that is what disables people.\u201c\n\nWe understood that the word <i>society </i>is too big in this context and we need to narrow it down.\u00a0So we asked ourselves what is our target group?

My story is about how I realized the importance of environment and the great role that society must play in solving the problem of pollution. It was last year in spring. I was returning home with my parents by car from our detached house and when we were crossing the bridge I saw a man who was trying to lug three boxes full with bottles .I asked my father to stop and I went to help that man. When I came up to that man I realized that he is not Armenian he was American . I must say honestly that it was a shame for me, because he was a foreigner but he was thinking about our environment more than many Armenians do .After I found that he was the Ambassador of America in Armenia. I was amazed with that surprise. We walked to his place, which was about walk for 10 -15 minutes. So we were talking about different thing such as education, I told him about my projects at our students consul and about my social activities. After collecting that bottles would send them to special center for recycling.\n\nBefore all this I thought that ok I am not making my environment dirtier, I am trying to keep clean my city, I am trying to use less water if it is not necessary I, am trying to save energy. But after I understood an important thing- we are responsible not only for us but also for others\u2019 actions too. Because this is not only a local problem this is everyone's problem. So the sample of John Heffern was so educative for me. So after that every weekend I am organizing small groups of young people and we are going to our parks or other places where are bottles, paper or metal and other litter like that. So anyway I will keep on doing all this and I think that this is my mission. Moreover I am going to set up an organization of young people who will stand beside me and we all together will fight against pollution.<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-14 21:21:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:52.619357", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 373, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2105, 2201, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58074, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 10017, "post_number": 51, "raw": "Right now I\u2019m reading \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d by Antonio Martinez.

I guess this is a common thread to the people on the edge. For example, the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315\">unMonastery</a> was in part a product of the need for finding one's own rhythm. It turned out to be very challenging, but at least it was not the usual challenge \u2013 it was a different one.\u00a0\n\nMy personal way to look at it is to draw inspiration from biology. In the natural world, there is no one but you to underwrite your pains. Even parasites have to be good at parasitism, or they will die as individuals or go extinct as a species. At the same time, a successful species in biology is definied as one well adapted to its ecological niche,\u00a0<em>not\u00a0</em>in terms of how close it is to to the top of the food chain. A frog is not a failed crocodile: it is a successful animal by its own yardstick. Put a crocodile in a European pond, he'll starve to death, whereas frogs do just fine. By the same token, it would be weird to say that a craftsman is a failed CEO! He is just not.\n\nWe should not take the analogy too far, of course. But I guess what annoys you is that you do not agree with the idea of success that mainstream society is promoting. In that case, the first move is probably to accept it, and decide you are going to measure yourself\u00a0in some other way.\u00a0Maybe, then, it will not be a vulnerability at all that you do not like ticking boxes! In my experience, it helps to find communities of like-minded people, because it takes a lot of effort to be alone in upholding an alternative vision of society!\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-16 10:24:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:54.150352", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 327, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 56.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59228, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 10755, "post_number": 4, "raw": "What about those cities that have those barrier columns that go up in parts of the inner city so you can't drive there?

So for ten people it would be about 17000 kWh per year.\n\nIf you want to produce 25% of electricity using solar panels, you'll have to make 4250 kWh per year. Then to know the quantity of solar panels to install it will depend on :\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Nominal power of each solar panel : currently a 300W solar panel has a size of about 2m * 1m</li>\n\n<li>The location (solar potential)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo for Matera with a 2.4 kW installation (eight 300W solar panels) you would produce 4690 kWh per year using solar trackers. To estimate the PV production you can use <a href=\"http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/apps4/pvest.php\">this site</a>.\n\nOf course this is an average value for a year. During the the winter it will be significantly less so you'll have to adjust according to the season.\n\nSo to evaluate the costs of such an installation you'll have to consider other things :\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The cost of a solar panel will mainly depend on the power it can produce (if you have space you can imagine using less powerful solar panels, which are cheaper). On ebay I found a secondhand 300 W / 24 V solar panel for 600 \u20ac. So it would make 4800 \u20ac in our case.</li>\n\n<li>Then you have to add costs for motors, structure to put the panels on, various cables and converters.

[The Cities for People](http://citiesforpeople.ca/en/about) initiative in Canada is also super interesting. (My apologies if I'm sharing the obvious... I have plenty more references if you want them just hit me up). \n\nRecently, I've been involved in some community consulting as a part of a new project that's bringing together diverse collaborators in Montreal's community development. It's called the [Listening Platform](http://listeningtomontreal.org/) and is trying to address the way in which we listen and weave together to the abundance of voices involved in a cities evolution. I think it could be an interesting reference as Living Streets grows. One reason in particular is I'm also left wondering how you are engaging the breadth of the communities in Ghent in this project - is it including socially-excluded communities or is it more a creative placemaking project? Over the years I've collaborated with an amazing organization called the [Design Studio for Social Intervention](http://www.ds4si.org/) (incubated out of MIT's urban engagement lab) and I continue to be inspired by how they use placemaking approaches to include and empower marginalized voices. Their [Creativity Labs](http://www.ds4si.org/creativity-labs) could be interesting for you too. \n\nAnyway, that's a lot I know (and I haven't even touched on my masters yet! :grinning: ) . In short, great to see how you've expanded out of government, and curious as to how you're continuing to move beyond traditional approaches to this kind of important and generative work. \n\nPS.

Because FreeAgent allows admins to edit anyone's timesheet without that action being logged, it does not conform to the requirements you cite from the Commission's timesheet template:\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:15, topic:9143\"]> linking the electronic  identity data (e.g.  a  password  and  user  name) to the electronic validation data,  with  a  documented and secure  process  for  managing  user  rights  and  an auditable log of all electronic transactions[/quote]\n\nSo that leaves us with the following options:\n\n1. As you propose, \"the PDF (however generated) is digitally signed by both the collaborator and supervisor with the Estonian ID and DigiDoc.\"\n\n2. We don't use FreeAgent but a different SaaS platform for time tracking so that the Commission's requirements for \"digital signing\" are fulfilled. There are a few to choose from (Toggl etc.) but they are not cheap. We'd have to take a close look.\n\n3. We find a way to use Discourse to record the timesheet information. I'm pretty sure it fulfills the requirements of digital signing, since all post edits and [staff actions](/admin/logs/staff_action_logs) are properly logged (including the \"Impersonate\" action).\n\n    If we want to choose this way, I could talk to my other brother who is developing this [open source time tracking utility](https://github.com/jansorg/tom-ui) right now. He'd add a feature that makes the tool automatically post to a user's timesheet topic in Discourse, using the user's own Discourse API key. The user could also edit that topic manually, of course. Information would be put in using CSV format so we can process it further with the proposed script (that would otherwise connect to FreeAgent).\n\n    Still, this would be a pretty strange way to collect timetracking information.\n\n4. <strike>Alternative 2: paper.</strike> Not really. People don't necessarily have printers anymore, or might be in Nepal from where postal shipment is difficult, and so on. So much overhead.\n\nWith the Commission's understanding of \"digital signing\", the director could also sign a post by editing it and adding \"approved by <username>\".

It's clearly an interesting point in the trajectory of open source wetware. \n\nThis decentralised stuff was never easy, for anyone.

But you wetware guys are really in the regulator's crosshairs. \n\nHopefully technologies like cell-free extracts will help with regulation, and microfluidics will help with cheap raw \"experiment scalability\". But in the end, I think Malcolm is really really right: at the end of the day, open source hackers need to bite the bullet and redo the work from scratch, but this time with the right license. Stallman and Torvalds and the others, they had to redo what other had already done. GNU/Linux was, at the beginning, a poor relative of Unix: but it was open, so it could be improved. \n\nAnd once that was done, you *still* had the problem of figuring what the hell was going on in the code that you were supposed to improve upon. Turns out hackers are better at getting code to run than at documenting it. Vast amounts of time are spent in trying to decipher code which is legally open, but hard to understand and therefore not really actionable.

However, the action of doing this over an extended period is REALLY hard work, and needs to be done well.\n\nIf you'd like to understand the Access Space formula, check out our comic book \"Grow Your Own Media Lab\":<a href=\"http://bit.ly/GYOML\"> http://bit.ly/GYOML</a>\n\n(2) Artists are particularly interesting people in demographic terms - their lifestyle, outlook, and society's perception of them allows them to connect vertically, linking people from different socio-economic groups. The biographies of many artists show that they hang out with princes and paupers, bankers and beggars. As well as running Access Space, I am an artist, and I wonder whether this gives me a particular license to link with diverse people.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nBest regards,\n\nJames\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-17 15:52:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:12.205753", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 239, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54141, "user_id": 5144, "topic_id": 10017, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Code isn't the solution, so we'll be throwing people at the problems.

Evidence of organized social media manipulation campaigns which have taken place in 70 countries, up from 48 countries in 2018 and 28 countries in 2017. In each country, there is at least one political party or government agency using social media to shape public attitudes domestically.\n\n2. Social media has become co-opted by many authoritarian regimes. In 26 countries, computational propaganda is being used as a tool of information control in three distinct ways: to suppress fundamental human rights, discredit political opponents, and drown out dissenting opinions.\n\n3. A handful of sophisticated state actors use computational propaganda for foreign influence operations. Facebook and Twitter attributed foreign influence operations to seven countries (China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela) who have used these platforms to influence global audiences.\n\n4. China has become a major player in the global disinformation order. Until the 2019 protests in Hong Kong, most evidence of Chinese computational propaganda occurred on domestic platforms such as Weibo, WeChat, and QQ. But China\u2019s new-found interest in aggressively using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube should raise concerns for democracies\n\n5. Despite there being more social networking platforms than ever, Facebook remains the platform of choice for social media manipulation.

Also, the rules make it such that a priori there is no special preference given to people depending on gender - everybody should have equal time to engage, and hopefully everybody will shed any shyness of inferiority they may feel, in a nice and humane environment.

There will be a lot of shameless copying and stealing of ideas, as we are essentially building a multi-tenant clone.\n\nI hope this project can be seen as some kind spiritual offshoot of the original Dreams platform, with the goal of taking its magic to more places than before, without necessarily trying to be a successor or replacement. If you would like to use the Dreams process and know some Ruby/Rails, the original platform should be the way to go still.\n\nAs for PostgreSQL, it actually might be the most moving target here :sweat_smile: , as the idea has been to stick close to the stack of Realities, except for its graph database which seemed overkill for the use case here.\n\n[quote=\"felix.wolfsteller, post:3, topic:11476\"]\n\n[quote=\"gustav, post:1, topic:11476\"]\nWhat other use cases beyond burns can you see for the Dreams process?\n[/quote]\n\nI mentioned the project today in a chat of people from https://makers4humanity.de/ which is a conference/festival/gathering - probably close to the current use case.\n\n\n[/quote]\n\nVery cool!

And yet, the collective is cohesive enough to produce, at least for some of us, a sense of warmth and belonging. The best, for me, is when you have some local community _as well as_ the global, Internet-mediated community. Brussels is good that way; maybe a dozen people who are reasonably active on Edgeryders are here, and I can see them often. Also, I like to spend time on the platform, talking to people who I cannot see that often, like I'm doing now with you. And then, of course, I try not to miss the physical gatherings like the OpenVillage Festival. In other words, I try to be part of networks both at the local and at the global scale.\n\nI am sure there are others like you in your local surroundings, in South Africa!

Alison was sat on the front row and afterwards we were talking and she was looking at my face very intensely - finally I realised she was lip reading. At that time I was involved in a lot of stuff about digital inclusion as well as participatory events, but meeting her made me realise that we weren't even close to social inclusion of people with disabilities and led to me questioning much of what I was doing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/17O6O6rilZ0?rel=0\n\n(text transcript of of whole video at bottom of post)\n\nAlison runs P<a href=\"http://www.peskypeople.co.uk/\">esky People</a> which started off as a blog to rant about disability access from a digital point of view because it was being completely ignored. The Digital Britain Report mentioned the word access in terms of getting people online, but nothing about about the fact that 99% of websites are completely inaccessible, and as we are now moving into the continual steam of videos and pictures and websites steaming events live it is becoming more inaccessible.\u00a0 What Pesky People does is try to keep the issue visible. Alison says that, \"the <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/peskiness\">peskiness</a> of it is really challenging companies to get things right by blogging and sort of naming and shaming them\". She started phoning the PR department of companies saying, \u201cby the way there is this blog post about your company and this is how bad is about it and er, what are you going to do about it?\u201d\n\nThe idea of Pesky People is really to flag up issues, and it started with a personal experience. Her first blog post was about being miss-sold a mobile phone from Orange and she called it \u201cThe Future is Not Orange!\u201d \"The worst thing was I got a mobile phone that didn\u2019t work with my hearing aids and my mac. And then every time I went back into the shop about four times within 3 days I was getting worse and worse customer service and to the point I was surrounded by four members of staff screaming at me and basically having a go at me and I was trying to say \u201cI have a PUCK code you will cancel this contract, you will ... basically it was a 2 year contract\u201d, she explains.\n\n\"The blog post then got picked up by Radio Shropshire and I became the main news item at 12 noon on the radio and that really got things sorted out.\"\n\n<strong>The impact of social media</strong>\n\nFrom this experience, Alison realised that blogging and social media could really have an impact and then it snowballed from there to the point of taking on issues and giving other disabled people a platform to blog about issues. There is economic sense to it as disabled people are worth \u00a380 billion a year but, \"we get treated really shoddily by businesses and websites (being inaccessible) ... so I\u2019m sort of a pain in the backside to the issues and going \u2018I can\u2019t access any of the online steaming of events and webinars because they are NOT subtitled! \".\n\n\"Without my hearing aids I am profoundly deaf,\" she continues,\u00a0 \"So I have to find ways of accessing this information whether it is by twitter or reading lots of text ...I am also dyslexic so that throws it further.\"\n\nPesky People doesn't make her a living at the moment but she has had funding to take the whole access/digital issues beyond a space where, instead of trying to search all the kinds of access information about all various spaces, with the development of <a href=\"http://www.peskypeople.co.uk/go-genie/\">GO GENIE</a> they are trying to find a way of getting it all on one page, on a mobile or online and the idea is to crowdsource that info.\n\nShe is trying to keep digital and disability really connected and trying to use technology to move forward. \"So the way I have been employed is through the funding to do this project, but it\u2019s been really hard and all what I do as blogging as Pesky People I do off my own back voluntary and it ... people have a big perception that because it is disability we are quite happy to give you all our advice and knowledge for FREE!! Quite frankly it really pisses me off we are treated like this!\", she says.\n\nAlison is trying to talk to the Arts Council, NESTA (who both gave funding for the prototype of Go Genie which Pesky People is developing) and Technology Strategy Board to ask why isn\u2019t their content accessible and why they aren\u2019t putting out any guidelines to make sure that anything which is built includes that audience. 20% of the population is disabled, 1 in 3 people know somebody who is disabled and 10% of the UK population are carers. Disabled people feel they are going to be locked out of everything to do with digital technology.\n\n\"I started Pesky People off because I was applying for jobs, getting shortlisted and not getting them and I thought I cant find work, well I need to find ways of getting me work!\" she explains.\n\nHer background is in Disability Arts and she was Artistic Producer and Site Manager of DaDaFest in Liverpool 2008 dealing with the council, health and safety as well as the production side. She has worked mainly with disability arts organisations, particularly in community engagement as well as Programme Manager for a contemporary arts producers where she went from being in an organisation with an annual budget of around \u00a360,000 to an organisation where each project budget was about \u00a350,000 which made her realise that there was a lot of money being put into contemporary arts but, \"if you were in disability or anything to do with social exclusion we were not seen to be important.\"\u00a0\n\nAlison has been personally criticised for raising issues such as an exhibition which didn't list disabled access to the many venues used. If she wants to go to events she has to negotiate with the organisers to discover if they will provide access. \"If you go to an event, you just get booked up, have a cup of tea and you're in\u2026I have to wait till the last minute to know whether or not I've got a place because they've sorted out the access and then I have to scrabble around for accommodation and travel.\" She points out that there are only 200 British Sign Language interpreters for the UK, but 70,000 deaf people who use it as a first language. She herself uses it as a second language as she was born hard of hearing and became more deaf in her 20's. All this makes it difficult to go to events but it's also hard to get people to understand that disabled people are good at what they do and she asks why she shouldn't be given the same level of respect as a consultant? It's very hard to make a living and she's been very close to just giving up many times.\u00a0\n\nPesky People got good funding from the Arts Council, Nesta and Nokia most of which has gone into development costs but the support and infrastructure to make it into an organisation has been really hard to get. People don't get involved because they need to be paid so she asks how she can she take a project with huge potential like <a href=\"http://www.peskypeople.co.uk/go-genie/\">Go Genie</a> and make it work.\u00a0 Policy makers should take a holistic approach - funding around a project, not just paying the bills but providing expertise in things that she can't afford to do such as business advice, funding help etc. Disabled people are at a disadvantage for funding none of the TSB (Technology Strategy Board) information is accessible, often leading to the missing of deadlines.\n\nShe wonders why, if so many people love the Pesky People project, why isn't she getting more support such as mentoring. She has had great mentoring including\u00a0 from the organisation who gave funding for the accessibility of the Pesky People website and are still giving mentoring support although the contract has finished. She finds it hard to fund raise for her own position while she is doing so many other things in the project.\n\nI ask Alison if she's investigated crowdfunding. She has but it's yet another thing she needs to do and she mentions her problems of dyslexia within the context of research and project writing. There's a problem of coming across opportunities by accident, which means that you miss many.\n\n<strong>Both Sides of the Network</strong>\n\nWe talked about the impact of cuts to benefits in the UK which are aiming to remove disabled people's entitlement by declaring them able to work. Alison answers that, in the first place there are no jobs and that secondly employers won't employ disabled people as they see it as too much hard work, despite statistics showing that disabled workers work much harder. The scaremongering around the cuts is pushing attitudes back to how they were in the past. She describes the difficulties for getting benefits currently while the press is portraying easy access, but the disabled are seen as easy targets.\n\nI asked Alison about the effect of Internet access and social networks to disabled people, if they are useful or another obstacle. She thinks they are a combination of the two. \"I wouldn't be able to do what I do for Pesky People if it wasn't for Twitter for example. That got me my networks &amp; connections and ironically in the early days it was the people who weren't disabled but who really wanted to understand the issues and wanted to support the issues; that was invaluable for getting me known.\" She explains how twitter has enabled her to get changes made by mobilising networks and engaging with organisations, highlighting specific problems and suggesting solutions. However, the flip side, as she sees it, is that the more social media is used to raise issues, the more people may switch off due to the image from the media of the disabled being benefit scroungers anyway. She also points out that trying to use the Internet and social media to make a living has been scary and feels that people expect everything for free.\n\n\"In future, the policy makers have to challenge and on the one hand you have public open data and involve different elements that are free online and they have to be paid for and the people who are doing the work - have to be paid. So there has to be a way of properly supporting projects and doing it holistically.\" Without a proper foundation she feels many people reach a stage where they give up.\n\nI asked about the importance of her network, whether it is mainly through twitter or from other areas too. She answers that it's mainly Facebook, twitter and going to events that make her network, and that in the early days she was lucky to go to a lot of digital events which gave her the knowledge and understanding that she needed. \"And what I love about using twitter especially is that I can have direct contact with someone quite senior within an organisation that you wouldn\u2019t have if you went through the usual channels,\" she notes, giving some examples of how that has worked for her. She adds that twitter is also accessible\u00a0 rom a Deaf point of view, she has instant access and is on the same level as everyone else.\u00a0\n\nMostly people respond to her when she approaches them this way. \"Most people are very approachable and I think it is because I\u2019m raising issues and trying to get a balance on how I\u2019m contacting them so I\u2019m not just going \u2018you did this!\u2019 It\u2019s like \u2018you really need to sort this out because it\u2019s a big problem.\"\n\n<strong>Go Genie</strong>\n\nGo Genie\u00a0will hopefully help by making it easier for people to find the access information and facilities to places they want to go to easily and be able to contact them without a lot of hunting around for the information. It is a website, mobile app (on iOS and Android) and it\u2019s a downloadable app on the Symbian platform. \"The whole thing is around having all the short cuts for access information so you have got the access symbols, you have got contact details, so you can email, go straight to the web page with the access info, contact them on Facebook and twitter or looking at OpenStreetMap, print it all off - you can add to it, you can say exactly what the access is like. So an organisation might say that their access is fantastic but then someone visits and sees the lift is broken and they can\u2019t get up to the first floor. So there is a way of saying \u201cI\u2019ve been here 10 times now and the lift has not worked once.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s trying to capture that information and actually provide a really good way to know where you are going from an access point of view but the objective of it help is to help everyone, its not just about disability access, its about family friendly, is there a lift, is there parking close by and answer all those things.\n\nWe finish off with her explaining her current situation: \"We are in the Race for Apps competition and I have got no doubt (you know) competitions like that are important to raising profile and HOPEFULLY find a way of getting investment and further support.\n\nThe flip side is we have run out of money as the funding has come to an end, I\u2019ve got no developer, there is just me and trying to find another way of getting more resources to make it really happen.\n\nIt\u2019s there, its live it works. You can even go onto the website on your laptop and reduce the screen size and it will turn into the mobile version, so it has got some nice features about it.\n\nAnd we are going to be hopefully working with OpenStreetMaps so they are going to start documenting access to come up with some sort of guidelines to how we can put access onto all their OpenStreetMap so that is going to be opening an new door, like getting all that information more widely available and how we can use it within Go Genie.\n\nTrying to keep going and just get that next phase going and (money).\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Full video transcription provided by Alison:</strong>\n\n<strong>Chris</strong>: Hi err\u2026 Who are you? Where are you? And how do you attempt to make a living on the edge?\u00a0\n\n<strong>Alison</strong>: HI em I'm alison smith i run pesky people \u2026 <a href=\"http://www.peskypeople.co.uk/\"><span>www.peskypeople.co.uk</span></a> em (cough)\u2026 \u00a0\n\nAnd it really started off as a blog to really to rant about disability access from a digital point of view because it was being completely ignored (em) and Digital Britain Report mentioned the word access' in terms of getting people online but absolutely\u00a0 NOTHING about about the fact that 99% of websites are completely inaccessible (em) as we are now moving into like the continual steam of videos and pictures and websites steaming events live and what have you it is becoming MORE INACCESSIBLE\u00a0 so, what we are doing is really trying to keep the issue up there and and at the same time the peskiness of it is really up is really challenging companies to get things right by blogging and sort of naming and shaming them and (err) what I started doing ... was phoning them up ... phoning their, their PR department up and saying \u201cby the way there is this blog post about your company and this is how bad is about it and er, what are you going to do about it?\u201d\u00a0\n\nSo for example The BBC Doctor Who Experience, a visually impaired woman went down the, the, Doctor Who Experience in London, told them she was blind, got handed an Itouch with subtitles on it(!) She\u2019s standing there with a white stick! Got asked for her driving license and it so of went worse and worse. So I saw some tweets about it what she was saying on twitter and contacted her and She did this FANTASTIC blog post about what went wrong but also what they needed to do to to make it right.\u00a0\n\nSo I thought hang on I need to tell the BBC! This it is really important there are lots of Doctor Who Fans and em she\u2019s a big Doctor Who fan there\u2019s got to be a way of sorting this out. THREE phone calls later I\u2019m talking to the Head of BBC World Wide branding! Em to be honest (Philip Flemming) he was brilliant I emailed the blog and within three days got a really really good response and then they sorted out the access and invited Samantha (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/dalakette\"><span>@dalekette</span></a>\u00a0on twitter) back to to see what they had done and really give her a brilliant experience of being there - which is the way it should have been in the first place!\n\nAnd em ...\n\nWell the whole thing of Pesky People is really to flag up issues, and it started with me personally em, my first blog was about being miss-sold a mobile phone from Orange and I called it \u201cThe Future is Not Orange!\u201d (Chris giggles) Alison: thanks. Chris (giggles).\n\nThe worse thing was I got a mobile phone that didn\u2019t work with my hearing aids and my mac. And then every time I went back into the shop about four times within 3 days I was getting worse and worse customer service and to the point I was surrounded by four members of staff screaming at me and basically having a go at me and I was trying to say \u201cI have a PUCK code you will cancel this contract, you will ... basically it was a 2 year contract\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe blog post then got picked up by Radio Shropshire and I became the main news item on the 12 noon on the radio (giggles) and that really got things sorted out.\u00a0\n\nI then realised hang on ... blogging, social media can really have an impact and then it snowballed from there to the point taking on issues like Samantha\u2019s and giving other disabled people platform to blog about issues\u00a0 means that we find a way of sorting them so\u00a0 ... there is an economic sense\u00a0 to it as well we are worth \u00a380 billion a year yet we get treated really shoddily by businesses and websites (being inaccessible) ... so I\u2019m sort of a pain in the backside to the issues and going \u2018I can\u2019t access any of the online steaming of events and webinars because they are NOT subtitled!\u00a0\n\nWithout my hearing aids I am profoundly DEAF!! So I have to find ways of access this information whether it is by twitter or reading lots of text ...I am also DYSLEXIC so that throws it further.\n\nand em\n\n<span>The whole thing Pesky People and it makes a living (giggle) - in a sense ... at the moment it doesn\u2019t, but I have had funding to sort of take the whole access digital issues and take it beyond a space where instead of trying to search all the kind of access information about all various spaces with GO GENIE we are trying to find a way of getting it all on one page one, one thing, so you just link and press it where it is on your mobile or whether you are looking at it online so tying to crowdsource that info.</span>\n\nSo I\u2019m trying to keep disability, digital and disability really connected and trying to use the technology to move forward. So the way I have been employed is through the funding to do this project, but it\u2019s been really hard and all what I do as blogging as Pesky People I do off my own back voluntary and it ... people have a big perception that because it is disability we are quite happy to give you all our advice and knowledge for FREE!! Quite frankly it really pisses me off we are treated like this!\n\nSo I\u2019m trying to talk to Arts Council, NESTA (who both gave us funding for the prototype of Go Genie) and Technology Strategy Board to say:\n\nWhy isn\u2019t your content accessible? Why aren\u2019t you putting any guidelines to make sure anything is built has that audience? I mean 20% of any population is disabled ... 1 in 3 people know somebody who is disabled ... 10% of the UK population is carers, you know it is a really HUGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE and yet we are going to be locked out of everything to do with digital technology, the new products that are coming online and even as basic as watching BBC iPlayer or ITV iplayer the subtitles for me are never working right. I stopped watching THE VOICE because the subtitles were about 10 minutes behind everything that was on screen (distorted) ... continually a message coming us saying that the subtitles would appear again in \u201c52 seconds\u201d which to seem to coincide when where every anybody was singing ... you know it really ruins the viewing experience it it really makes me think well they don\u2019t care about us because otherwise they would .. and they would think about access at the very beginning!\u00a0\n\nEven the programme Space Programme, The Space Arts Programme I\u2019ve been ... had a Skype conversation with them ... they were like \u2018oh we have a very limited budget and two developers\u2019 so I said well what are the BBC and Arts Council doing to make sure there were standard to make your content accessible for your audiences?\n\nWell in a way what I\u2019m doing campaigning and for what I\u2019m trying to do in a practical way is get things to happen and that is being a big challenge as well as actually earning an income form it. I started Pesky People off because I was applying for jobs getting shortlisted and not getting them and I thought I cant find work well I need to find ways of getting me work!\n\nMy background is in Disability Arts and I have done everything from being Artistic Producer of DaDaFest in Liverpool 2008 City of Culture where we shut off 4 roads and I was Site Manager as well dealing with the council all that side of things health and safety as well as the producing side...\n\nMy whole background is in working in with mainly disability arts organisations particularly community engagement so everything from running a national programme of creative writing workshops and performances in Scotland England and Wales for Survivors\u2019 Poetry, to trying to set up a Disability Arts Forum in Northumberland ... to being a Programme Manager for a contemporary arts producers where I went from being in an organisation with an annual budget of say \u00a360,000 to an organisation where each project budget was about \u00a350,000 and it you know it was a real eye opener it made me realise that there was a lot of money being put into contemporary arts but yet if you were in disability or anything to do with social exclusion we were not seen to be important and em that was quite an eye opener.\n\nWith Pesky People I\u2019ve found, I\u2019ve gone from doing a blog that was very personal and putting myself at being very open to being criticised which I have been quite directly that I was jeopardising an arts organisation funding for raising access issues.\n\nAll I was trying to do was say why was the Home of Metal Exhibition not displaying the access information for all their venues then they were expecting me or anyone who was disabled to go FIFTEEN different websites to find that info! And all they needed to do was put it on one page on their website.\n\nTo (em) being at Hello Digital where ... the organisation forgot to book sign language interpreters so I couldn't access any of that day\u2019s event I think the interpreter turned up at half past one!\n\nIt just if I book for an event I have to negotiate these organisers whether or not they will provide my access. If YOU go to an event you just book, turn up get a cup of tea and you are in.\u00a0\n\nI have to wait to the last minute to know whether I have got a place because they have sorted out the access, then I have to scramble around to sort out my accommodation and travel!\n\nAnd ... there\u2019s only 200 interpreters for the whole oft he UK there are 70,000 Deaf people who\u2019s use BSL (British Sign Language) as a first language.\n\nI use it as a second language because I was born hard of hearing and became more deaf as I went into in my 20\u2019s... my hearing went worse in my left ear went down to match my right ear.\n\nThat makes it quite difficult about going to events but) to get people to understand that you are quite good at what you do.\u00a0\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have to ask you to give me the same level of respect as a consultant\u00a0\n\n<span>em\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>I\u2019ve even had an organisation ... trying to say that because the length of time on the project why don\u2019t I not claim the last quarter of the money they owed me ...</span>\n\n<span><strong>Chris</strong> (mmm)</span>\n\n<span>So em, it is hard enough earning a living. It is bad at the moment, quite frankly I\u2019m not really earning.\u00a0</span>\n\nThe amount of times I\u2019ve been THIS CLOSE to giving up - even recently is really really hard\n\nWith Pesky People (it\u2019s me) I got funding from Arts Council, NESTA and even NOKIA\n\nSo within just over a year and half I had \u00a3 25,000 from Arts Council, followed by \u00a320,000 from NESTA, followed by \u00a325,000 from NOKIA and most of that money has gone into development costs (it is so expensive).\n\nBut the support and infrastructure to help me do this and become an organisation has been really, really hard to get.\n\nI still need money - people obviously don\u2019t want to get involved because they need to be paid. So how do I take something that has the potential to be absolutely massive with Go Genie and the whole thing around it becoming a disabled version of Get Satisfaction. It has got huge potential and yet I can\u2019t get infrastructure in place to make that happen quicker.\n\nGo Genie ideas are getting taken by other people!\u00a0 There are accessible apps out there -\u00a0 good on them but - there but I know what we are doing with the crowd-sourcing will got a lot further because of the flexibility and agility of it.\n\nIt has been really really hard be just one person driving this and I have been getting burnt out.\n\nEm\n\nIf you look at what policy makers should be doing it should be a whole list of support to do. If you are going to fund an idea or prototype fund around it not just about the builds! And that way issues from about intellectual Property-right\u00a0 Trademarking - things I can\u2019t afford to do.\n\nTo the whole business infrastructure being able to pitch at events and being able l to go to the right funders and investors.\n\nAnd (inaudible) me doing pesky People from a disability point of view I am at a complete disadvantage because none of the TSB (Technology Strategy Board)\u00a0 information is accessible for me to work out what I need to do to apply for funding!\n\nYou have to jump through so many hoops just to register and by the time you have done that you have missed the deadline.\n\nEm\n\n<span>\u00a0... The lack of building in the criteria ... involved so accessibility has been taken at it\u2019s heart.\u00a0</span>\n\nSo its a real combination of things for me. It about ... if I talking about Pesky People people say its great we love what you do and we think it\u2019s really important\u00a0 - then why aren\u2019t I getting more support?!\n\nMentoring\u00a0 - I found my own mentors in the early days of setting up Pesky People, Nick Booth gave me really invaluable advice. I got mentoring support from Unltd which was only \u00a34,500 that actually included \u00a31,000 access costs and that helped me make Pesky People website really accessible - that funding was in 2010 and they are still giving me mentoring support today and that makes a huge difference but I\u2019m not getting it from anywhere else!\n\nSo unless\u00a0 ... doing fundraising stuff like everyone else but if you are trying to say right ok I need to do this for myself and that is really hard when I\u2019m trying to\u00a0\n\n&gt; Keep the build going so that Pesky People and Go Genie really happens;\n\n<span>&gt; find a way of networking and crowdsourcing element of it;</span>\n\n<span>&gt; finding the investment and fundraising opportunities;</span>\n\n<span>&gt; trying to network at events and really get known so people can connect up with me and then I find ... as one door closes another door opens</span>\n\nAll those sort of things take time and effort and that is a team and I am one person.\n\n<strong>Chris:</strong> You were talked about crowdsourcing have you looked at crowdfunding?\n\n<strong>Alison:</strong> I need to do that ... part of the problem has been my dyslexia everything is up here and you need to get it down into a structure order on paper. I need to get that done, but yes I need to do crowdfunding,\u00a0 and the big question for me that I have been trying to find the answer to lets say we need X amount of money what do I give in return? Who do I get that advice from? Mmm\u00a0 Or do I just do it take the risk and see what happens.\n\nI really need to look into it.\n\nThat is the other thing ...\n\n<span>You come across opportunities by accident then on the other hand you sort of missing them because there is so much going on.</span>\n\nI\u2019ve missed applying for funding opportunities because things have been so busy and then I forgot about the deadline ... you know ...\n\n<b>Chris: </b>What is the effect of the cuts in the UK,\u00a0 the cuts in disability, how bad is that? How is that affecting your community?\n\n<strong>Alison:</strong> Em the, reform ... the welfare rights bills reform in particularly in taking HUGE numbers of disabled people off and saying that they are eligible for work. One there is no jobs out there, two employers wont employ a disabled person they will see us as too much hard work, they wont see that we can actually do the job when even statistically research has proven that we will work five times as harder than anybody else. Never mind we have these disability and access issues.\n\n<strong>Both Sides of the Network</strong>\n\nThe welfare cuts are scaring people its not just about cutting the money its the attitudes and scaremongering in the press. I think attitudes have been shoved back 40 odd years.\n\nI know as a kid anything around disability you were OVER there, in a corner in an institution!\u00a0 Em, I even remember my dad saying, trying to get support that it means would be classed as disabled what do you think about that, I was nine at the time.\u00a0\n\nI didn\u2019t understand what the big deal was and now it\u2019s like ... they\u2019re (disabled people) are challenging what\u2019s coming out from government - they are trying to say there is this huge fraud less than 0.05% and yet they want to get 20% of disability people off Disability Living Allowance!\n\nAs a Deaf person looking at their new criteria I won\u2019t get Disability Living Allowance and when I did get it before it before it took me FIVE years to get it, FIVE years of appeals. So they say these benefits are easy to get\u00a0 it is utter rubbish!\n\nBut that is what is going into the papers, that is what people are reading and that is what people are believing!\n\nSo for me being a disabled person and being very public about being Disabled and Deaf\u00a0 - that I have also have hidden disabilities I\u2019m not just deaf (em mean that in a nice way!)\n\n<span>(giggles)\u00a0</span>\n\nThat there needs to be a way of balancing an all they are doing is seeing us as easy targets ...\n\nIt is cutting education, its going to cut support in the communities, its going to cut organisations that are supporting disabled people. An and it\u2019s like so what do they want us to do get back into the workhouses!\n\nI mean that\u2019s what a lot of us are thinking. That ... we are NOT seen as being valuable enough to be a completely in society especially if people are on benefits.\n\n<strong>Chris:</strong> Is the internet any ... has there been a change in anyway ... is it a way out could it be a way out for disabled people (depending on the disability of course)\n\n<strong>Alison:</strong> What in terms of the way of using the internet?\n\n<strong>Chris:</strong> Yes you began Pesky People as a blog and saw you could make it bigger and hopefully make a living out of that ... er ... is internet access, is social networking - are those thing of any use to - is there a future there or are they just more obstacles.\n\n<strong>Alison:</strong> A combination - em ... I wouldn\u2019t\u00a0 be able to do what I\u2019m doing with Pesky People without twitter for example - that got me my connections and networks. Ironically in the early days it was more so people who weren\u2019t disabled who really wanted to understand the issues and also wanted to support the issues.\n\nEm ... That was really invaluable in getting me known em you know to the point ...\u00a0 a brilliant example is the National Digital Inclusion Conference which is happening at the end of the month.\u00a0\n\nWhen I contacted them (in 2010) and said I wanted to attend ... they weren't going to ... I got an email back two weeks before the conference eventually with a reply even though I applied before Xmas and they eventually got back about March (2010).\n\nThere weren't going to book BSL interpreters because their deaf access would be restricted to induction loops and plantypist (speech to text transcription on a screen).\n\nSo I got on twitter and just said \u2018national digital inclusion conference is not accessible is in ... doesn't include deaf people!\u2019\n\nGetting that to the attention o the funders and attention of people going and there was an outrage about it. I wasn\u2019t just thinking about me I was thinking about anyone else wanting ... not just about me.\n\nThey had to backtrack! And they had to get book interpreters at very short notice which fortunately they did.\n\nWhen I got there the first morning it was like ... you are streaming live why aren\u2019t you streaming it live\u00a0 you have got a plantypist that can go straight on to the internet, you have got BSL interpreters\u00a0you can put them on the internet!\n\nI am glad they took me up on that! So that 2010 conference was the FIRST digital event that was fully accessible with online streaming from a Deaf point of view! With Audio Description that is another kettle of fish so any video content whether it\u2019s audio described.\n\nThat was a really massive boost to us it was like hang on it is just as simple as telling people about it very publicly!\n\nSo then wasn\u2019t just stuck at home an complaining to your friends you have got a huge platform to really get issues out there.\n\nBut now the flip side of it because of the welfare reform bill and all the issues around that how do we ... how do we get the issues out there and get the attention it deserves\u00a0 without it being like \u2018here we go again!.\n\nAnd that is a challenge!\n\nI mean the all the stuff going around the Spartacus Report is fantastic and\u00a0 really proven how WRONG the government's been on things and how their own research has been hiding fact.\u00a0\n\nBut the flip side the more it\u2019s out there are people just going to be switching off from the issues because we are just a bunch of benefit scroungers anyway! You know?\n\n<strong>Chris:</strong> mmm\n\n<strong>Alison:</strong> Em I mean, the big thing with making money point of view ... from earning a living side... quite frankly I\u2019m NOT earning a living properly.\u00a0\n\nIt's been very scary and it\u2019s hard to find a way to get that big step forward and really I really do feel there is a big perception level is that people expect you to do it for FREE!\n\n<strong>Chris:</strong> mmm\n\n<strong>Alison:</strong> I mean, that is the great bit about social media is that we help each other but we all need to be able to keep the roof over our head.\n\nAnd I think that is something that, in future, the policy makers have to challenge and one the one had you have public open data and involve different elements that are free online and they have to be paid for and the people who are doing the work - have to be paid.\u00a0\n\nSo there has to be a way of properly supporting projects and doing it holistically.\u00a0\n\nNot just about doing the build, you are funding the infrastructure of the build but you are also funding the infrastructure of the organisation or the people around it, And whether that also includes mentoring support it gives a proper foundation to ... otherwise, things stop n and people give up! You know I\u2019ve been that close so many times even recently.\n\n<strong>Chris:</strong> How important is your networking and that?\n\n<strong>Alison:</strong> mmm?\n\n<strong>Chris:</strong> Your network is mainly through twitter or it\u2019s from other area?\n\n<strong>Alison:</strong> Its mostly Facebook, well twitter and more so now Facebook, em ... going to events. I mean, I mean I was ... lucky in the early days of Pesky People I got to go to so many digital events it really did give me the knowledge and understanding that I needed.\n\nAnd I mean see now when I look at arts organisations looking to do things in digital and its like they DON\u2019T have that foundation ... em so for me all my networks are, its a real mix its not just disabled people it\u2019s also organisations and community groups and charities it\u2019s a real mix mix bunch.\n\nAnd what I love about using twitter especially is that I can have direct contact with someone quite senior within an organisation that you wouldn\u2019t have if you went through the usual channels.\n\n<strong><span>GO GENIE</span></strong>\n\n<span>I went to a Futuregov event which was around, the whole issues around the benefit system and how that could be improved.\u00a0</span>\n\nAnd the idea was it bit of sort of a hack ... lets see what we can pull together and em met the guy responsible for introducing universal credit and then I told him oh by the way I\u2019ve been contacted by a Deaf woman who has just had her benefits cut because she didn\u2019t phone the job centre yet there is no minicom number or email number for her to contact them! She is profoundly Deaf with two kids!\n\nSo he was like \u2018oh you can contact your job centre by ... whatever\u2019 ... that doesn\u2019t happen!\n\nSo being able to have that contact and email him direct and go by the way that this has happened again...\n\nI got no doubt that her benefits got reinstated so much quicker\u00a0\n\n(Chris murmurs in agreement)\u00a0\n\nthan it would have had if she had to try and the person saying \u2018you didn\u2019t come in!\u2019 and \u2018I was ill, and I couldn\u2019t contact you and you don\u2019t give me ... the best means for contacting me for my disability!\u2019\u00a0\n\nIf they can\u2019t get it right on that level what hope have you got if the government going right all benefits, claims online, everything will be done online but they have no infrastructure in place to really take on the access issues at the same time.\n\nSo ... with twitter for me especially means I can have direct contact with people that I would never have been able to!\n\nAnd it\u2019s also its accessible obviously from a Deaf point of view, I have got instant access and I\u2019m on the same level as everyone else.\n\nThat social media and the internet ... when it works and it\u2019s accessible.\n\n<strong>Chris:</strong> When you contact these people ... through twitter or Facebook people that you\u00a0 would never normally reach do they respond to you?\n\n<strong>Alison:</strong> Mostly, yeah my golden rule is I treat people with respect, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever sworn on twitter if I find somebody offensive I unfollow them!\n\nIf I get things wrong I apologise straight away em ... and I have had happen a couple of times!\n\nMost people are very approachable and I think it is because I\u2019m raising issues and trying to get a balance on how I\u2019m contacting them so I\u2019m not just going \u2018you did this!\u2019 It\u2019s like \u2018you really need to sort this out because it\u2019s a big problem\u2019.\n\nAt sometime today I\u2019m going to be on the warpath about the fact that Coldplay ... Coldplay are performing for the end of the Paralympics and the big issue is that none of the ticket online ticket providers like Ticketmaster and See Tickets have a really easy way of if you are disabled to book tickets - you have to phone them!\n\nOr in the case of Coldplay at Arsenal Football club (in June 2012) you have to wait FOUR HOURS after the tickets are sold out to see the access information come up on Arsenal Football Club website! Then you have to fill in, download a form, fill it in sign it and return it. You can\u2019t even book your tickets over the phone or by email! Everybody else just tick! a couple of buttons and got them!\n\nIn the case of @dalekette who is going to see them in London at the Emirates Stadium they have put her ... allocated her a seat within the wheelchair accessible spaces, bearing in mind she is partially sighted she can\u2019t even the stage even with the equipment she uses!\n\nSo what she should have done (as she told me) is paid DOUBLE the price for the tickets so not just paying for herself but paying for her PA so that she could be in the standing area at the front with everybody else.\n\nThey (Arsenal Football Club) would not allow her to get tickets for that area!\n\nSo Coldplay are really big supporters of disability issues they have got a number of band members who are disabled ... its like well they are really supporting and really raising profile of disability access they do a lot of gigs with Scope (note should be Mencap) and yet when it comes to going to their gigs the infrastructure behind it\u00a0 like the promoters and the stadiums and venues ... are completely letting us down. You can\u2019t just physically book tickets easily like everybody else!\n\nSo there is going to be place for Pesky People! Because issue like that coming up so can flag it up and get things sorted then it has a bigger impact all round.\n\nLike, One Call Car insurance refusing to give a Deaf woman car insurance and after doing a blog post on Pesky People the publicity was enough for them to say we will give you the car insurance and make sure that there is a we have a national system so that you can contact for breakdown service using a text message system.\n\nI mean it is not difficult!\u00a0\n\nBut you know..\u00a0\n\nIt would be nice to get that funded and supported in some way it wouldn\u2019t just be one or two issues it would be quite a lot and that is what I hope Go Genie will help do.\n\nIt won\u2019t its not just about the access information all down in one page it will be about .. here is what we can do to sort it out report it! it will go straight to them.\n\nSo if 30 people are complaining about the same issue then they realise hang in it is a problem ...\u00a0 if there are 30 people across 30 stores complaining about the fact they can\u2019t find the wheelchair accessible changing room as it has been used as a store room for example as NEXT does.\n\nThen it\u2019s a real issue that can then ... people power that whole crowd sourcing stuff comes into play again.\n\n<strong>Chris</strong>: So Go Genie is an app you are building? What is it exactly?\n\n<strong>Alison:</strong> Its a website, mobile app (on OSX and Android and it\u2019s a downloadable app on the Symbian platform.\n\nThe whole thing is around having all the short cuts for access information so you have got the access symbols, you have got contact details, so you can email, go straight to the web page with the access info contact them on Facebook and twitter or looking at OpenStreetMap, print it all off you can add to it you can say exactly what the access is like.\n\nSo an organisation might say that their access is fantastic but then someone visits and sees the lift is broken and they can\u2019t get up to the first floor.\u00a0\n\nSo there is a way of saying \u201cI\u2019ve been here 10 times now and the lift has not worked once.\u201d for example.\n\nOr\n\nI go to see gigs at the Glee club in Birmingham I know to sit in the first three rows to the right because the lead singer\u2019s mike is always in the same place and I know where I can to sit to lipread.\n\nSo it\u2019s trying to capture that information but actually provide a really good way to know where you are going from an access point of view but it sort of it helps everyone its not just about disability access its about family friendly, is there a lift, is there parking close by and sort of answer all those things.\n\nAnd mostly use crowdsourcing to get the content in.\n\n<strong>Chris:</strong> How far developed is that:\n\n<strong>Alison:</strong> It\u2019s live!, its\u2019 a prototype! It works! It gives me grey hairs!\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s, yeah it\u2019s working.\n\nWe are in the Race for Apps competition and I have got no doubt (you know) competitions like that are important to raising profile and HOPEFULLY find a way of getting investment and further support.\n\nThe flip side is we have run out of money as the funding has come to an end, I\u2019ve got no developer, there is just me and trying to find another way of getting more resources to make it really happen.\n\nIt\u2019s there its live it works. You can even go onto the website on your laptop and reduce the screen size and it will turn into the mobile version so it has got some nice features about it.\n\nI\u2019ve got some great ideas about how it can move forward\u00a0 and how it can be used.\u00a0\n\nAnd we are going to be hopefully working with OpenStreetMaps so they are going to start documenting access to come up with some sort of guidelines to how we can put access onto all their OpenstreetMap so that is going to be opening an new door like getting all that information more widely available and how we can use it within Go Genie.\n\nTrying to keep going and just get that next phase going and (money).\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-23 08:49:48", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 22:25:13.958485", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9181, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 40.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33919, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 6617, "post_number": 2, "raw": "This change was proposed by @nadia.

We sketched the backdrop, using statistics and cases...and looked at the narrative they were sketching/ the assumptions underpinning the frame of enquiry. And then we problematised - asking whether they resonated with our own personal experiences. The stories people shared were honest, deep and vulnerable. It was the first time I experienced this kind of conversation outside a small circle of long term friends. @matthias is one of the people whom I met through this and together with a growing circle of people, we have gone on to build together something which has been transformative. \n\nI think what drove this is some kind of mission. For me it was more strong intuition of a direction in which we need to move, in order to find ways of being in the world which make us strong, happy and masters of our own destiny. Over the years we have managed to articulate it.\n\nI suppose what I am trying to say is that you need to have a position, and a place for people who want to join you to go so they find one another and can continue together.

In a culture that rewards stimulus, I sense a lot of artists feel lost and somehow disembodied from themselves. They have these sensitive instruments to look inside of themselves and others, but are easily overloaded and jammed with input. The internet, for better or worse, is a prime example of this problem - it can be used to reach and touch people around the globe; it can be yet another tool for desensitising, commodifying and 'freezing' your life experiences, turning us into the statues Watts is talking about.
