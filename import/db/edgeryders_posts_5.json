The rise of populism in the USA is strong and may or may not be continuing to rise.  A couple of years ago I would have said for sure it was on the rise, but there is now a kind of backlash going on that is represented by the most recent national election.  I think the result more accurately reflects the true mood of the nation as a whole. However, populist sentiment and loyalty is extremely strong and tenacious and they do essentially control the executive branch of the government, the Senate and some members of the US Supreme Court.  I think it is also worth noting that many of those with right-wing populist sentiments are also often climate change deniers.  Thus, right at the time when humanity most needs to lay down armed conflict and collectively figure out how we can avoid or mitigate a climate catastrophe, millions of Americans refuse to see it as a problem and instead focus their anger on refugees and border issues that, until Trump came along, were not broadly seen as particularly bad problems compared to others.  I think European society has a great opportunity to lead us all out of this wilderness.  So, along with wanting more people to learn how to develop and manage meaningful communities, I feel I have a personal stake in all of this even though I live in North America.  And I have grown children and several grandchildren. So I naturally worry about what kind of world I am leaving for them.\n\nI\u2019m interested in a lot of things personally that are unrelated to world problems, probably too much to list here.  Music, film, nature and taking care of the little ranch where I live on the northern coast of California.  And I have a pretty big family (wife, 4 kids, 2 step kids, 7 grandchildren) who live nearby and depend on me for various kinds of love and care, including my 93 year old mother whose care is my responsibility.\n\nI struggle with being so far away from my colleagues sometimes, even though we are networking professionals who are comfortable with living and working long distance via networked computers.  Even though I teach online community work, and have a long history of doing it myself, I emphasize the importance of physical contact.  Not just for people who are relatively new to online communications that perhaps have more depth than common social networks, but for myself as well.\n\nI also struggle with my health.  though it is good right now, I am a recent cancer survivor and that reality dictates much of my life now.  And at my age, I know most of my life is behind me and yet I never want to think that my best work is behind me.  My work with Edgeryders makes me happy, but I struggle to keep up with them sometimes...for me there has always been a tension between being active and reflective, or work vs hanging out...", "created_at": "2019-01-18 10:29:30.577558", "updated_at": "2019-01-18 10:39:39.998005", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 572, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 64.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3067], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49570, "user_id": 4797, "topic_id": 7122, "post_number": 29, "raw": "Yes, that would be cool :) How many beans per second (on the conveyor belt) did you process?

Takes on Google and the Danger of Monopolies,\" my op-ed\non tech antitrust and its connection to the digital rights movement.\n\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/the-justice-department-finally-takes-on-google-and-the-danger-of-monopolies\n\nI'm in my 19th year as a digital rights activist, and while there's a\nvogue of accusing the movement of being blind to the possibilities of\ntecho-dystopia, that's a revisionist history. You don't devote your life\nto the cause if you think it's automatically going to be great.\n\nBut there was a blind-spot: the assumption that antitrust action would\nmaintain the dynamism, opportunity and variety of the early commercial\ninternet, keeping it from devolving into five giant websites filled with\nscreenshots of text from the other four.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1069674780826071040\n\nThere was good reason for that assumption, of course. If you got online\nin the 1980s, then your modem connected to phone lines operated by\npost-AT&T-breakup; \"Baby Bells.\"\n\nThe reason your PC ran DOS is that IBM was so traumatized by a 12-year\nantitrust investigation that it allowed Microsoft to make its OS, rather\nthan risking more enforcement through vertical integration.\n\nAnd the PC clones from dozens of new upstarts were only possible because\nIBM didn't pursue the then-tiny company Phoenix for cloning its ROMs,\nagain, out of fear of a rerun of its antitrust trauma.\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/ibm-pc-compatible-how-adversarial-interoperability-saved-pcs-monopolization\n\nWhen Microsoft came to dominate 95% of the desktop, the DoJ stepped in\nagain to punish it, and if they failed in their breakup bid, at least\nthey cowed the Beast of Redmond so that it stopped killing startups the\nway it had with Netscape, allowing Google to rise.\n\nWhat we didn't understand was that Ronald Reagan had gutshot US\nantitrust enforcement and these were its last gasps, as it bled out over\ntwo decades.\n\nWe didn't understand how thoroughly Reagan's court sorcerer, Robert\nBork, had transformed the consensus on monopolies.\n\nWe didn't understand that every president that came after Reagan, right\nup to today, would continue to encourage monopolization under cover of\nthe doctrine of Robert Bork, creating a world where every industry has\ncollapsed into oligarchy.\n\n* Five publishers\n\n* Four studios\n\n* Three labels\n\n* Two brewers\n\n* One eyewear company\n\nand falling.\n\nWhich is why the federal Google antitrust action is exciting - not\nmerely because the complaint threads the impossible narrow eye of Robert\nBork's needle for anti-monopoly enforcement; but because it made so many\npeople recognize that getting Google for search dominance is like\ngetting Capone on tax-evasion. The pretense that monopolies are good,\nactually, is wearing so thin that even its beneficiaries are doubting it.\n\nOne area that interests me with my digital-rights-activist hat on is how\nmonopoly changed the fortunes of tech workers. Back when there was\ncompetition in the industry, tech workers had a stake in unfettered tech\nindustry growth.\n\nBut monopolization created the investors' \"kill zone\": the areas\nadjacent to Big Tech's walled gardens that no one will invest in,\nrecognizing that Big Tech can simply obliterate any competitor in these\nareas.\n\nThat leaves Big Tech to enjoy double-digit year-on-year growth without\nhaving to endure what Peter Thiel calls \"inefficient\" competition. It\nalso means that tech workers don't realistically dream of doing to\nGoogle what Google did to Yahoo.\n\nThe best they can hope for is to do a fake \"startup\" that's actually\naimed at \"acqui-hire\" - an acquisition for the sole purpose of hiring a\nteam that has proven it can field a product. The startup's product is\nflushed, and the VCs get a commission in the form of a buyout.\n\nInstead of building an empire or \"making a dent in the universe,\" tech\nworkers are promised a well-funded retirement, mini-kitchen kombucha on\ntap, and free massages on Wednesdays.\n\nThe path into the tech industry generally starts with the heady rush of\nempowerment that comes from writing code and using networks to share it,\nand to find communities of likeminded people. The rush of\nself-determination and agency.\n\nBut monopolists thrive by moving risk off their balance sheets and onto\nthose of their suppliers, users and customers - by confiscating and\nhoarding agency and self-determination.\n\nTechies who fell in love with the experience of technological agency now\nspend every hour God sends taking it away from others. I think that this\n- along with other fracture lines - is behind so many of the moral\nreckonings we're seeing from tech workers.\n\nTech Solidarity, Tech Won't Build It, No Tech For ICE, the googler\nwalkout, etc - techies are confronting their role in technological\ndystopia, and they are flexing their muscle. It's a gorgeous thing to\nbehold.\"", "created_at": "2020-11-02 18:00:59.142988", "updated_at": "2020-11-02 18:00:59.142988", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 905, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 211.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86152, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 14736, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I will hopefully (and probably) end up living in a rural place in Nepal within the next few years, and due to that had much of the same thoughts and conclusions that you mention in your post. Thank you very much, it's a good read, and refreshing to know there are others with a vision for the countryside :sunny:\n\nNow based on that Nepal perspective, here are some more points to help put this vision into a globally applicable context:\n\n1. **Internet.** That is the only infrastructure we can't put in place ourselves in rural areas, or only with real difficulty. Fortunately, [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) has 800 satellites up already, and should be ready for global use in 2021. Which from one day to the next brings fast Internet to the last village on the planet. The Ka-Band satellites etc. provide a similarly cheap service for Europe already, but in most so-called developing areas satellite Internet is still expensive, and geostationary satellites are quite useless for voice and video links, anyway.\n\n2. **Other infrastructure.** In my mind, there is no need for most of the infrastructure that government tends to install, including the water grid, electricity grid, wastewater connection, trash disposal, and (most) roads. With current tech options, this is cheaper and more sustainably solved at the house or neighborhood level. So no worries here \u2026 but it means \"it takes a village to build a village\":\n\n3. **Commune / community.** This is how I imagine rural sustainable development to be possible even in very remote places such as Western Nepal. Essentially, don't expect people to go there alone or as a single family to \"start something\", but as a commune of enough people so that they can be sure to have enough of the \"human potential\" of their liking around. Also, this will be enough people to allow building ones own infrastructure, as there can be a certain level of specialization (solar, water, Internet etc.). 15\u201320 people are enough when also allowing for a fluctuation of guests, which can constantly bring in new interesting people for a time. Such as, digital nomads:\n\n4. **Digital nomad lifestyles.** I don't see this as something inherently bad, but as another way to connect the urban and rural areas with benefits for both sides (if done right). Urbanites might not like to stay in rural areas full-time, but easily 2-6 months in a row as digital nomads. Saw a prediction yesterday that in 2021, 36% of the whole workforce will permanently be remote workers in the U.S., as companies discovered that productivity rises with that mode of work. It will be similar in other \"developed\" areas. If only 5% of these people discover the digital nomad lifestyle for themselves, nice rural places will have a constant influx of people to choose from. \n\n    For example, a friend of mine has a house in Gorkha, a rural municipality in Nepal with maybe 10,000 people, and 40,000 more in all the villages around it. Her place has speedy Internet already, a beautiful view of the Annapurna Himal, and is also the start of the Annapurna Circuit trek. Yet it's not touristy at all, even neglected in that regard. Perfect spot to have houses for digital nomads, if you ask me.\n\n5. **To deal or not to deal with government.** It's great to hear that your dealings with local government in Croatia are productive. I'm afraid the outcome will not be that in many villages in so-called developing areas. Fortunately, the points mentioned above (own infrastructure, coming as a community etc.) also mean that in practice very little to no dependency on local government is left. Overheard this in Nepal: \"Because the government is not dependable, we have these tight family bonds.\" That's people's security system and mode of getting something done, and I think it can work quite well when extended beyond relatives to intentional communities, and when combined with good human organizing. That last thing is the remaining challenge that I see; which is why (in a different thread) I tried to talk @amelia into doing an ethnographic study of successful commune and community organizing.", "created_at": "2020-11-02 22:43:52.427401", "updated_at": "2020-11-02 22:43:52.427401", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 708, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 73.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3206, 3, 1877, 3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76788, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13562, "post_number": 2, "raw": "The Webinar will start with a 20- 30-minute presentation/introduction on the process and resources created by DeLab for **[Thei interactive COVID info website](https://covid.delabapps.eu/)**\n\nAfter that we will discuss the data, it's origin, interpretation and influence with the participants and DeLab's experts together.\n\n* Did you always want to know how to get from a big sheet of numbers to a neat visualisation, trend prediction and how informed policy proposals based on this data are?\n\n* What could one learn from seeing a graph that shows the reporting of anxiety going up while depression seems to go down at the same time during the first few weeks of quarantine?\n\n* Many people have a hard time making sense of statistical data as we discussed in this converstaion: https://edgeryders.eu/t/statistically-feeling-bad/12845 .

I think we are half way there already. \n\nWhat needs to be concretely done:\n\n* Standardise the stylesheet across all components. The last few sites (start.edgeryders.eu, festival.edgeryders.eu) have used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). The benefit of this is visual consistency, the same set of utility classes (no guessing of class names or ids for anyone who wants to update the layout), easy to configure as well as customise on a per site basis without affecting the core library.\n* Set a convention for post metadata. One of the shortcomings of the festival site is it has a fairly arbitrary way of parsing posts - one example: for an event to be successfully displayed on the site, the event has to be tagged `webcontent-festival-event`, `event-date-01_12_2019` (this will be changed to read from the date extension @matthias has integrated into discourse), `event-location-brussels` (location), `event-confirmed` (to say it is happening vs proposed). In my view, relying too heavily on custom tags like these can lead to confusion and content breaking if something is missed. It's not obvious to the person writing the post and it also interferes with the semantic markup that makes tags so useful (I'm not sure how the ethnographic tools work, but I imagine these tags have to be filtered out at some stage as they are not relevant to the discussions). Having extensions in Discourse to handle this, like the existing one for date/time, means we can have standard input fields for events, community calls, organiser bios.. The options are clear and we don't have to second guess how content may be parsed.\n* Standardise language options: this is a little more work if we go the template route, as working with multiple languages modifies not only content but navigation, routing, organiser profiles (in the case of Wellbeing in Europe), the login UI. If we use the template you proposed it would have to include a language schema with translations of every button/paragraph/link etc for the content.\n* (Optional but convenient) Modularise the registration form, so questions can be queried and answered within each site without redirecting to a forms page.\n* Create a standard account control panel that integrates with the navigation menu\n\n[quote=\"nadia, post:3, topic:12063\"]\nTaking a view of the whole cycle, from announcement, to documentation to production of a follow up document.

We might need to rethink this. Perhaps the standard use-case for a small organization using only Dreams (which is what most of them will use) is to just create an event and not an org? That way, the free tier of Plato would keep everyone on the same realm while the paid plan would have us either create new realms for orgs and customize them according to their needs, or connect Plato to an existing IDP that the org is already running.\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:1, topic:14517\"]\nIt is important that the SSO server has ready-made connections to social identity providers like Google.\n[/quote]\n\n[This works with Keycloak.](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/7.0/server_admin/#social-identity-providers).

L'outil a pr\u00e9dit correctement ces deux combinaisons.\n\nAinsi, j'ai eu une bonne occasion de pr\u00e9senter le concept et ma vision autour de mon projet et j'ai d\u00e9montr\u00e9 un int\u00e9r\u00eat d'utiliser l'intelligence artificielle pour aider \u00e0 la prise de d\u00e9cision.\n\nCette r\u00e9union a servi aussi d'avoir un feedback sur mon projet et d'avoir une petite id\u00e9e sur les prochaines \u00e9tapes.\n\nLe d\u00e9veloppement de l'MVP sur la base de donn\u00e9es tunisienne et la validation de l'outil pourra prendre des ann\u00e9es et elle d\u00e9pendra de la disponibilit\u00e9 des sp\u00e9cialistes avec lesquels je travaille. \n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 avancement dans le d\u00e9veloppement, Iyadh a avanc\u00e9 sur le d\u00e9veloppement des modules du prototype et nous avons une squelette de l'application qui contient les modules importants. J'ai aussi re\u00e7u un feedback sur le d\u00e9veloppement de la part de mouhamed salem, notre consultant senior. A l'issu de ce feedback, je suis en train de faire des modifications sur le mod\u00e8le. Amel de sa part a avanc\u00e9 sur le d\u00e9veloppement du logo et il lui reste le design et la charte graphique de l'application.\n\nTenant compte des d\u00e9lais que pourra prendre le d\u00e9veloppement du MVP, J'ai pens\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre outil qui pourra g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des revenus et qui permettra de rep\u00e9rer des personnes ayant un d\u00e9clin cognitif l\u00e9ger. Cet outil se base sur un questionnaire d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli et fait. \n\nVoil\u00e0 ainsi une petite mise \u00e0 jour sur ce qu'on a fait jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent.", "created_at": "2020-05-30 21:31:24.501297", "updated_at": "2020-05-30 21:31:24.501297", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 333, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 26.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62255, "user_id": 5429, "topic_id": 11022, "post_number": 34, "raw": "I was going off of the message that comes along with the `cors_origin` site settings:\n![49|690x137](upload://vxMorLlctu8CEKOetuypondqshm.png) \n\nThere's a touch of documentation in the code about this, although I'll have to admit I had to dig for it as well, maybe this helps?\nhttps://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/ed00f3530621d61a272b237746b8bbb1eaea7998/config/discourse_defaults.conf", "created_at": "2019-10-25 01:21:09.816394", "updated_at": "2019-10-25 01:21:09.816394", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 58, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 26.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36177, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 6581, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Topics belonging to this challenge have been sorted into suitable sub-categories of [Knowledge Collection](/c/knowledge).

The best way I managed to develop is to avoid it and to concentrate on something positive instead. I should always be able to identify and opt for the benefit of anything happening with me or around me that most people would perceive as 'wrong' or 'harmful'.\n\nBeing part of a poor post-communist regime, being a member of an oppressed group of people, living in an environment where you and your family members keep bumping into discrimination for your ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or religion, and therefore being blamed for things you have never caused yourself requires a strong personal character and most of us do not believe we were born to be heros.\u00a0\n\nActually very few us believe that our own individual actions can make the change around us. How do we spread this belief around? How do I pass my own solutions to others and influence their decisions so they also go for the 'GO FOR' and not the 'GO AGAINST' strategy.\n\nI also believe in the power of music. Although as per my experience it goes together with dance hand in hand and I consider both music and dance as a gift to humanity that help us navigate through everyday difficulties with 'bad' thinking and feeling.\n\nSo then if I raise the question on how to react to racism, discrimination, oppression so that both you and the people perceived as coming against you will benefit from it, then my advice would be 'don't stop the music and keep on dancing unti everyone joins in'.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-18 06:27:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:12.407577", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 319, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36744, "user_id": 3311, "topic_id": 6683, "post_number": 28, "raw": "Hi All.

Amelia noted that \"we have a deficit of political will to invest in common institutions at this time\", and that's probably why you explore building these shared identities without state support. But building these new identities political nonetheless, since it's about managing common and public identity, and the communities you build might become the new political entities in the feature.\n\nA particular question would be: Could building parallel, new, non-state identities eventually reform the state identity idea and the political system as a whole? So far, I have only examples where it was the other way round (like, say, the Erasmus program contributing to citizens feeling and living in a more pan-European way, with a third of Erasmus students being in international romantic relationships as per <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/education/library/study/2014/erasmus-impact_en.pdf\">a recent study</a> ... that's not without effect on perceived \"European\" identity).\n\nWhat I like about this session is the ambivalence, where citizen action of building their own non-state identities is apolitical and political at the same time. How do you imagine the relations to the powers-that-be? Is it opposition to the state, or can it be even cooperation?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-18 16:09:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:12.920857", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 292, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60751, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11029, "post_number": 1, "raw": "_Hello \u2013 I have posted the text from the OpenVillage Category description below for us to collaboratively edit.

Some of us are already living and working in such a space in Brussels, called The Reef. Now we are setting up a new space in the MENA region.\nYou have the chance to design and build a community spot for MENA youth, the Reef MENA, to collaborate freely on groundbreaking projects in the quest for lives full of meaning, love and mutual respect.\n\n**Community connectors receive a fellowship consisting of:**\n\n1. A ticket to Edgeryders Festival in Brussels (19-21 October 2017) where we design the OpenVillage. At the festival you will be part of a team training on community building and digital security tailored for regional dynamics.\n2. A ticket to the MENA community camp in December (26-30).\n3. A project residency in the Reef- MENA, in November, the exact location to be announced soon. The residency consists of an online and co-working/ co-living space for your project, where you will prototype and test results, as well as model it for future sustainability.\n4. Fellows are expected to actively engage with people from their countries online and offline, write about their own projects or other projects that they see valuable, conduct interviews, and on-board people on the platform.\n\n**To be part of the adventure, sign up on [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu/).

We believe that the solution is an integrated network of local care services equipped with open source knowledge and technology.\n\nBecause we know that diversity is critical, we volunteer to coordinate a \u201csmart swarm\u201d decentralised application of hundreds of small communities and organisations: and we invite you to join it.\n\nThe process is simple:\n\n* In August we will hold virtual gatherings where people can present their projects, which will be posted on our platform for the community to discuss.\n* In September we will meet in person to shape our project proposals, circulate them for feedback from the community and create a final version.\n* In October, will build support teams around each selected project proposal through a series of online video meetings\n* In November, we will collaboratively develop project proposals so that they they have reached a point where we can prototype some key ideas during a month of hands on  *building*  in the Mena OpenVillage Camp.\n* In December the international community gathers in a beautiful location by the sea to evaluate one another\u2019s prototypes and work on each others projects so that they meet a clear goal to help move them forward and co-design the next phase of our journey together. We end with a party to kick in the new year in style.\n\nGetting started is easy!

We need to be mission driven, and stay for long (Mazzucato).\n\nThis initiative aims to develop sustainable, and hopefully profitable paths towards reaching our goal. The Edgeryders community and organisation are uniquely positioned to build it because of the track record of the people driving it. And the fact that we are already generating revenue, have zero debt and a thriving community of &gt;4000 talented, committed people in 80+ countries. With your participation we can get there faster and better.\n\n**Why three different names? Are they different projects?**\n\n* The OpenVillage is a comprehensive set of open tech solutions and collective action strung together by a common narrative.\n* Edgeryders is a collective intelligence platform for building the OpenVillage.\n* The Reef is our terrain for deep prototyping of the technologies, culture and new forms of human organising that will go into the OpenVillage\n\nThe OpenVillage House run by Edgeryders (The Reef) consists of:\n\n**A live-work space where we experiment with different solutions and develop the non-technical competences needed to use them effectively.**  Instead of doing a 2 week prototype, we run as we live with it, and keep tweaking it over time until it works. The stuff that stays with us will be included in the openvillage. ICOs for real estate, Robots, smart clothing, furniture, new forms of organising, art. It will be sustainable because people need a place to live and organisations need a place to work - revenue will come from rent of residential spaces in a unique setting amenable to personal and professional development.\n\n**A Business network consists of people and organisations who wish to be close to where the action is.**  Edgeryders is already a place to access and nurture a unique stream of open innovation. Hand-held echostethoscopes that cost a fraction of what is on the market. Cheap coffee bean sorting machines. Mechanical arms to rotate and increase yield from solar panels. New assistive and medical devices and open source insulin. As part of the business network you can interact with us, get news from the edge and be part of it even if you cannot live with us.\n\n**These innovations are open source, and they are accessible, but their use is restricted by different licenses issued by the innovators.**  When an idea or product under development is of interest to commercial companies  **The Reef can broker a deal in which the innovator can give different additional rights of use with a contract. This protects both parties against abuses.**  The business model is the one employed by [opencorporates.com](http://opencorporates.com/) and [thenounproject.com](http://thenounproject.com/) - pay to wave right to be named as author and in the latter case, gain access to the original design file.\n\n**An Annual Festival and series of events gathering the community building the openvillage and the business network around it** . The festival happens not in an anonymous conference room, but in the live-work space located where the openvillage is being built. It presents the new knowledge, artefacts and ideas coming out of The Reef, draws more participants and grows the ecosystem. It acts as a heartbeat that gives a steady rhythm to the work of building the openvillage over 10 years, grows the community and celebrates the achievements that come out of it.\n\n**How Edgeryders finances this and generates income for the community involved in it**\n\nWe build it as a viable business with multiple sources of revenue. It makes sense to build the Reef as a new company because this enables us to capture, align and channel all the externalities generated by the live-work space, business network and festival towards growing and strengthening the venture. The model is infinitely scalable: our online platform, digitial technologies and scientifically rigorous methodology enable us to cost-effectively scale and the remote membership. We have a couple of ideas for non-extractive and ethically sound business models with opportunities for personal and professional development that draw a steady stream of talented individuals. And we will design an appropriate governance model that balances the needs of the community with that of the people who take personal responsibility and invest huge amounts of time that is needed to get the company up, and keep it running well.\n\nOur world-class community building and management expertise make The Reef a safe and welcoming space that draws and maintains the diversity required for deep innovation.\n\n**If the model catches on people will show up at our doorstep and say this is great, how can I do it in location x** ? Then we can move in and franchise the venture complete with a populated online platform and activities (which is the hardest thing to do- almost no one manages to get this right). Clients can pay us to help them set up their own Reef around a specific field e.g. healthcare. A person with a great network approaches us saying \u201cI really want to build one of these in my city\u201d; \u201cwe say great! You\u2019re hired!\u201d And they manage the setting up of a new company owned by the Reef.\n\n**This is already happening.**  It happened with the unMonastery -as soon as the Edgeryders community started exploring the idea, the city of Matera asked us to run, and paid for, the first prototype. The project gained unsolicited coverage from international and local media (The Nation, New York Times, Il Sole 24 ore, Wired Germany etc etc), speaking engagements at large public events etc. The World Bank has commissioned us to implement a version in the MENA region as a place based social innovation incubator.\n\n**We envision a network of Reef localities in every city bound together by an online platform which acts as a collective intelligence engine and extends the reach and scale of the model.**  And we are on the way. The first one was set up in Brussels in March of 2017. A second locality is now under development and with your help, will be up and running in Morocco by 2018. The online platform is already up and running (you are on it right now) and populated by a thriving community that spans the globe.\n\n**By joining us early in the game you get a unique opportunity to shape your own involvement and the company as a whole** . We are designing a multiplicity of ways to participate at different levels of commitment- from accessing newsletters all the way to partnering with us around new ventures e.g. large R&amp;D projects which generate new commercial opportunities e.g OpenCare.\n\n[Become a member](/#todo)\n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Where are we are going with this?**  A future to look forward to, collaborating freely in the quest for prosperous, lives full of meaning, love and respect in tight knit yet open groups. It\u2019s not about becoming reclusive tribes, nor is it about rejecting technology. We want to connect with one another, and with the world at large. To be well with ourselves and with one another. To thrive when failing institutions or existing large-scale centralised means of securing a good life no longer can be relied on.\n\n**How will we get there?**  We have a long-term map of different components needed in a good life. For most of us, accessing several of them through existing means is difficult or impossible. At least if you look to what is available in the mainstream where power and resources are concentrated. You need to venture out to the edges where people are experimenting with all kinds of solutions for building thriving individuals, communities and societies. So we look for open source solutions and replicable efforts to satisfy our needs and work to make them accessible to a more people.\n\nOn the new online platform we reach out to and connect people working on current issues and encourage them to share their stories, leave thoughtful reflections on the stories of others\u2019 and respond to others\u2019 comments on their own. We use community management and software to transform thousands of conversations into shared knowledge and concepts for how participants\u2019 existing work can be connected to achieve impact at scale. Knowledge gained from hands-on practical experiences is transformed into wisdom powered by Collective Intelligence.\n\n**Which themes and topics will you cover?**  We have a map of all the components of a well-functioning life and community based on consultation with people in over 200 cities. We convene conversations around one priority to focus enough energy and resources to move beyond  *talking* . Right now it\u2019s how we sustainably care for one another\u2019s health: physical, social, mental and emotional.\n\n**How can I bring this to my own community or geographic location?**  We support members to host events in different locations where participants meet in person, get to know one another and build big exciting ideas around which collaborate. People who participate in this process gain access to valuable information, new perspectives, and a huge network of contacts who can help unlock new opportunities for them. They understand where there are efficiencies to be gained, mistakes to avoid and skills to be developed. Individual changemakers use this collective intelligence to help them move their own efforts forward.\n\n**Why should different people and organisations partner with this initiative?**  Allies have access to new initiatives as they are being born and can get involved at an early stage. Existing projects and their business/sustainability plan are documented in a standard format then posted on the community for further development. Participants are free to use and modify them under condition that attribution is given to everyone else who has contributed to its development so far, and that they have contributed something time or money to the project.\n\n**How can I meet and get involved in the global community?**  You can participate in our annual community gathering that is build by community members, for community members. The objective of these events is to 1) build a holistic, shared understanding of the topic at hand 2) demo a credible systems level solution made of interoperable, smaller scale projects 3) use the evidence-backed vision and impact strategy to generate backing (attention, skills and time) for participants\u2019 projects.\n\n**How can people deploy and maintain their own OpenVillage house?**  Participants will collaboratively deploy one instance of each selected project within the Reef to serve as collective learning opportunity and demo of what is possible. We then support those who participated in setting up the first instance, to do the same in their own local context.\n\n**How will we know when the vision is achieved?**  Over time we build a full set of connected techniques, knowledge, relationships and culture that supplies everything needed for long term healthy, sustainable and enjoyable living. We have become a critical mass of people who have developed the skills, infrastructure and resources needed to build and sustain ourselves. And have made many new friends along the way :slight_smile:\n\n**Why Edgeryders?**  What sets Edgeryders apart is that we actually have the tools, methodology and organisational capacity to turn the participants\u2019 \u201ctalking\u201d into collective intelligence and action.\n\n**I want to be a part of this, but I already have a demanding project which I don\u2019t want to give up- is there some way I can participate anyway?**  The process is structured in a way that doesn\u2019t require participants to give up what they are already doing or join someone else\u2019s project. It is designed to work both for people who wish to work on location, as well as those who wish to participate remotely. The not for profit organisation stewarding the process uses revenue from commercial work to finance the long-term coordination work needed to make this all possible.\n\n**How can I support this initiative?**  Come talk to us so we can pick a task that works for you. If you prefer to contribute money to help offset costs you can talk to us about how we can do this without compromising the integrity of this community driven initiative.\n\n\n[text-direction=rtl]\n\n## **\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u062a\u0648\u062d\u0629: \u0625\u0641\u0627\u062f\u0629

while building better lives for ourselves**\n\nWhere we are going: A future to look forward to, collaborating freely in the quest for prosperous, lives full of meaning, love and respect in tight knit groups. It\u2019s not about becoming reclusive tribes, nor is it about rejecting technology. We want to connect with one another, and with the world at large. To be well with ourselves and with one another. To thrive when failing institutions or existing large-scale centralised means of securing a good life no longer can be relied on.\n\nHow we get there: We have a long-term map of different components needed in a good life. For most of us, accessing several of them through existing means is difficult or impossible. At least if you look to what is available in the mainstream where power and resources are concentrated. You need to venture out to the edges where people are experimenting with all kinds of solutions for building thriving individuals, communities and societies.\n\nOn the new online platform we reach out to and connect people working on current issues and encourage them to share their stories, leave thoughtful reflections on the stories of others\u2019 and respond to others\u2019 comments on their own. We use community management and software to transform thousands of conversations into shared knowledge and concepts for how participants\u2019 existing work can be connected to achieve impact at scale. Knowledge gained from hands-on practical experiences is transformed into wisdom powered by Collective Intelligence.\n\nWe convene conversations around one priority area at a time. Right now it\u2019s [how we sustainably care for one another\u2019s health: physical, mental and emotional](https://edgeryders.eu/t/introducing-open-care/33).\n\nWe support members to host events in different locations where participants meet in person, get to know one another and build big exciting ideas around which collaborate. People who participate in this process gain access to valuable information, new perspectives, and a huge network of contacts who can help unlock new opportunities for them. They understand where there are efficiencies to be gained, mistakes to avoid and skills to be developed. Individual changemakers use this collective intelligence to help them move their own efforts forward.\n\nAllies have access to new initiatives as they are being born and can get involved at an early stage. Existing projects and their business/sustainability plan are documented in a standard format then posted on the community for further development. Participants are free to use and modify them under condition that attribution is given to everyone else who has contributed to its development so far, and that they have contributed something time or money to the project.\n\nWe collaboratively build an annual Festival. The objective of these events is to 1) build a hollistic, shared understanding of the topic at hand 2) demo a credible systems level solution made of interoperable, smaller scale projects 3) use the evidence-backed vision and impact strategy to generate backing (attention, skills and time) for participant\u2019s projects.\nDeployment and maintenance. Participants will collaboratively deploy one instance of each selected project within our own open village to serve as collective learning opportunity and demo of what is possible. We then support those who participated in setting up the first instance, to do the same in their own local context.\n\nOver time we build a full set of connected techniques, knowledge, relationships and culture that supplies everything needed for long term healthy, sustainable and enjoyable living. We have become a critical mass of people who have developed the skills, infrastructure and resources needed to build and sustain ourselves. And have made many new friends along the way :slight_smile:\n\nWhat sets Edgeryders apart is that we actually have the tools, methodology and organisational capacity to turn the participants\u2019s \u201ctalking\u201d into collective intelligence and action. The process is structured in a way that doesn\u2019t require participants to give up what they are already doing or \"join someone else\u2019s project. It is designed to work both for people who wish to work on location, as well as those who wish to participate remotely. The not for profit organisation stewarding the process uses revenue from commercial work to finance the long-term coordination work needed to make this all possible.\n\nHow we are getting there and how one can contribute: a number of challenges that are \u201cconstant\u201d, and what you see on arrival. We start with what our ideal situation is (how life is in the open village) and then reverse engineer it. How did that happen? What came before that? And before that? These become our milestones around which the challenges are shaped and a growing community convened.\n\nWriting our shared story in the the future, backwards.\n\n\n## **Le village ouvert : Faisant du bien en construisant une vie meilleure pour nous-m\u00eames**\n\nUne initiative pour promouvoir la jeunesse et l\u2019employabilit\u00e9 en Moyen-Orient et en Afrique du nord .\n\nNotre destination (ou allons-nous ?) : Vers un avenir qu\u2019on contemple ensemble. Un avenir dans lequel nous collaborant librement dans la qu\u00eate de prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9, d\u2019une vie pleine de sens, d\u2019amour et de respect mutuel au sein de nos communaut\u00e9s interconnect\u00e9s.\nIl ne s\u2019agit pas de devenir des tribus restreintes, ni de rejeter la technologie.

Nous les encourageons \u00e0 partager avec nous leurs histoires et \u00e0 laisser des r\u00e9flexions sur les histoires des autres et ou \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux commentaires des autres .\nPour se faire nous utilisons la gestion communautaire et les logiciels pour convertir des milliers de discussions en connaissances et concepts qui seront partag\u00e9s avec d\u2019autres personnes afin d\u2019atteindre un r\u00e9el impact.\nC\u2019est ainsi que nous transformons les connaissances recueillies en sagesse aliment\u00e9e par ce qu\u2019on appelle l\u2019Intelligence Collective.\n\nA chaque fois que nous faisons cela nous choisissons un sujet \u00e0 d\u00e9battre selon les priorit\u00e9s :\nPar exemple notre priorit\u00e9 en ce moment est la fa\u00e7on dont on peut am\u00e9liorer la sant\u00e9 de l\u2019homme de mani\u00e8re durable sur le plan physique mental et psychologique.\n\nNous soutenons les membres de notre communaut\u00e9 pour organiser des \u00e9v\u00e9nements dans diff\u00e9rents endroits o\u00f9 les participants peuvent se rencontrer en personne pour mieux se conna\u00eetre et construire ensemble de grandes id\u00e9es passionnantes autour desquelles ils\ncollaborent pour les concr\u00e9tiser.\nLes membres participants auront acc\u00e8s \u00e0 de pr\u00e9cieuses informations pourront d\u00e9couvrir, de nouvelles perspectives, en plus d\u2019un \u00e9norme r\u00e9seau de contacts des personnes qui peuvent leur offrir des opportunit\u00e9s.\n\nAinsi, ils seront en mesure de cerner les facteurs cl\u00e9s de la r\u00e9ussite et la mani\u00e8re d\u2019y parvenir tout en \u00e9vitant les erreurs.

They are not being changed, simply made explicit.*\n\n## 1. Background and principles\n\nMost Edgeryders projects need to procure goods and (especially) services to achieve their objectives. This document contains the guiding principles and recommended practices for doing so. \n\nThe overarching principle is this: Edgeryders aspires to be part of a long-term healthy productive ecosystem. That means being a competent and vigilant client, that avoids waste, but not an exploitative one, that elicits cutthroat rates from our suppliers. It follows that the goods and services we procure should be adequate to the needs of our staff. They should also be cheap enough as to be good value for money, but not so cheap as to become extractive. \n\nTo achieve these goals, Edgeryders procurement practices should:\n\n1. Incorporate some element of competition across suppliers. This will prevent us from getting complacent, and keep scanning for better quality and fairer pricing. \n2. Be nimble and as little bureaucratic as possible. We want our staff focused on delivery, not compliance with internal norms.  \n\nThis policy was written with procurement in the European Union and other high income countries in mind. We reserve the right to adopt different ones for projects anchored in middle- or low income, where market conditions are different. This is true in particular for the quantitative thresholds of section 2.\n\n## 2. Which kind of service?\n\nWe classify goods and services in the cells of a 2x3 matrix. Some examples are given below:\n\n|            | off-the-shelf        | bespoke                      |\n|------------|----------------------|------------------------------|\n| **very cheap** | paper clips          |   (no such thing)                           |\n| **cheap**      | printing of leaflets | one editorialized blog post  |\n| **expensive**  | retreat venue        | video production             |\n\nFor the purposes of this policy, \"very cheap\" means \"no more expensive than a few tens of euros for the whole supply\". \"Cheap\" means \"no more expensive than a few hundred euros per supplier\". \"Expensive\" means \"everything else\". Please note the \"per supplier\" part of the definition: a single 50 paperclip box would cost about 2 euros in a stationery shop in Brussels, and therefore be very cheap. If, for some reason, we were to need a large supply of millions of paperclips, then we would be dealing with an expensive item, and recommended procurement practices would change.\n\n## 3. Procurement practices\n \n \n The recommended practices for procuring a good or service depend on which cell of the matrix it falls in. \n \n * For *very cheap* items, the main scarce resource is the time of the staff procuring the item. Just go out and buy it, bring a receipt, don't waste time on procurement. \n * For *cheap and off-the-shelf* items, we recommend browsing two or more websites of suppliers, then picking the best combination of low price, high quality and convenience (for example delivery). \n* For *expensive and off-the-shelf*, we recommend starting by a web search as above, and then \u2013 unless the websites are especially well made and clear \u2013 getting in touch to clarify any remaining doubt. For example, when renting a venue for an event we could be asking about accessory services, like Internet connectivity, drinks and refreshments, and the presence of a technician on site. It is best to try to get written offers, from two or three suppliers.\n * For everything *bespoke*, we recommend recruiting from the Edgeryders community when possible. Edgeryders is, after all, a social enterprise, and many of the thousands of members of our online community are freelancers. In the past years, our preferred method of recruiting contractors has been via open call on the Edgeryders platform, also reshared on social media, newsletters, emails and so on. This works very well for the special (and frequent) case of content generation: editorialized blog posts to get a conversation started, documentation from events (\"community journalism\"), and so on. When this is not possible or appropriate (as would be the case for local services, which are a poor fit for Edgeryders as a global community), we recommend recruiting from the communities that we are working with. For example, when procuring videos we have worked in the past with local crews when working on the Matera European Capital of Culture 2019 project.", "created_at": "2020-01-05 16:30:49.519545", "updated_at": "2020-01-05 16:31:52.182597", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 692, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 76.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 5201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86448, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 14769, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Perfect, you can focus on the Health one, I got this.

For example - If promoting events, for them to be successful,you need an attractive , short description and nice visual promotion materials. You also need to push out attract content like stories or videos on the channels tp draw attention to your activity at least 1-3x per week there should be posts that give some more info about the event (who is attending, stories of organizers\u2026), as that gets people more interested in it. This should be paired with responding to questions in their native languages where possible. 2) Writing content/blogs/articles: research (few hours) - including links if applicable, structuring (what is the right structure to ensure the story is an engaging read that makes people want to take action - 1 hour), deciding on voice and tone of the piece (who are we writing this for, why, and what language does this suit - 1 hour), writing the article (1 or 2 hours depending on length). This is a bit arbitrary, because usually it's more fluid, and it also depends on what background knowledge the writer already has. Also, an outside voice is usually much better in explaining complex products/subjects, as they are not burried in the already existing jargon. For most people here, end-to-end encryption is a super easy term, but the majority of people have absolutely no idea what it entails; they may have heard of it, but they don't really know what it does. The result is that words like those in social messaging and in headlines can scare people away (this is not meant for me). Again, this depends on the target audience.\nRegarfing social media messaging: finding appropriate visuals takes a few hours, writing good, effective social media copy takes a lot of time (what do we want people to do with this: read the article? Then what? Join a conference? Why should they?). It's really complex and a lot of people, companies and organizations who do not have those kind of skills/human resources, really miss out: they dont' get any results, but did put a lot of time in it.\nA great example my economics professor once used: There's this lawyer, and he's quite ok with numbers, so he decides to do his own accounting. But because he's not a professional, it takes him much longer. And his time is money too. Although he thought he would safe money by doing it himself, the evenings he's crunching numbers are work hours. If he would pay an accountant to do it, who could do it much more efficient, the time he's not spending on accounting he can now either spend as a lawyer, or to rest. Cost count on a couple of thousand Euros a month._\t\n4. **How edgeryders approach is an improvement:**  _add text describing how much time & cost & complexity you slash by doing it the Edgeryders way_\t\n5. **How to make most of the event and the platform to unlock the benefits:** _add text here_\n6. **How to get started:**  _add text and URL here_\n7. **FAQ:** _add text here_\n8. **Visual Materials:** \n\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n# Benefit:  Discover alternative perspective and answers to complex issues\n1. **Description of benefit:** _Edgeryders uses online and offline channels to seed, harnesses and grow collective intelligence around the topics that matter to you. 1) We support your work with crowdsourced research 2) Our research team processes data from the platform using sensestack, our open source stack of technologies that we have built into the platform  to produce interactive visualisations of the conversations around the topics that matter to you 3) Our community managers coodinate the work of building participatory events such as workshops and conferences and festivals.

Then you have to read and filter between everything they have produced . You then need to engage them or others in conversation around their work (there is a reason why science is very much about dialogue). You have to consume and process large amounts of information and keep track of what has been said by whom, what their position is and what other positions there are. And then if you want others to give you feedback on what you knowledge you have gleaned from all this, you need somehow to present your analysis to others.

Here we go.*\n\nFirst off, this is all very tentative, because looking at the graph generates intuitions, but I cannot verify them because of the bug that prevents reading the full text underpinning the edges (heads up @hugi). This is a severe limitation.\n\nAnother massive limitation is that the Detangler view does not work at all (cc @matthias). \n\n## Graph with >= 2 co-occurrences\n\nThere are several connected components. I am ignoring the ones with only two nodes and one edge, too embryonic to build much on. This leaves two small and one giant component. \n\nThe smallest >2 nodes components, it seems, is about Poland and organizational arrangements of populism. The other one reflects a more abstract conversation, with codes around gender and participations.\n\nThe giant component has a center of mass based on three high-degree nodes: `leaving home country`, `personal change`, and `bubbles`. `leaving...` connects to codes seeming to represent a rich world view that comes with physical mobility. If I had to make a guess, I would guess that part of the conversation is about how diaspora people see things differently from those who stay behind. `Bubbles` has the connections you might expect for a conversation about echo chambers, including the revealing `value mismatch`. I find most intriguing the connections between `personal change`, `leaving home country`, `encountering difference` and `feeling at home`. Pretty clear what is going on here with the diaspora anti-populists.\n\nIn the same region of the graph, we encounter what looks a relevant group of codes around `values mismatch`. \n\n![image|690x477, 75](upload://e1SG4cFLnNSeHvDn62YAmqGZU6g.jpeg) \n\nOn one side of this there are `leaving home country`, and the codes of modernity like `personal change`. On the other, the codes of tradition like `religion` and `traditional values`. We can infer that the conversation contains accounts of the conflict between the two sides,  as it plays out in the political and media landscapes (`cultural` and `political influence`) and in the self (`emotionally difficult` and of course `values mismatch` itself). Moving further away from the codes of modernity, we seem to find a more theoretical part of the conversation, centered on `moral code` and composed mostly of codes representing abstractions.\n\n## Graph with >= 3 co-occurrences\n\nWhen \"filtering in\" only codes co-occurring three or more times, we are left with a graph with only 15 nodes and 9 edges.\n\n![image|690x316](upload://mc38ZrHEPmQCFtKTeu3BKgj354C.jpeg) \n\nHowever, the macrostructure of codes of modernity (associated to `leaving home country`) connecting to codes of tradition via `values mismatch` is still recognizable. If I were to venture a guess, I would argue that this is a promising avenue for analysis, and we should try to examine in depth the evidence we already have for how this contrast plays out in people's lives, and elicit more.", "created_at": "2020-02-03 11:33:24.801572", "updated_at": "2020-02-03 15:19:27.909697", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 485, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 119.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323, 3, 2915, 4794], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18761, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 1571, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Interoperability and co-ordination</b>\n\nI guess its best if coordination can be as automated as possible, saving the necessity for individuals to have to work hard pulling things together.\u00a0 Also I guess giving some structure to interactions / work makes things easier.\n\nExamples of interoperability -\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/community/fedsocweb/\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web\n\nI follow this stuff a bit but I'm not a coder or data cruncher so I guess others would have a better handle on this stuff.\n\nI'm involved around the edges of Open Source Ecology.\u00a0 As far as I can tell it operated largely on the huge efforts of the founder and love of those who liked it - until recently when major funding started to flow and, I think, individuals were recruited to help with the organisation / co-ordination.\n\nThere have been a few efforts to make the organisation/co-ordination more stream lined by using agile / scrum software development methods.\u00a0 The adoption of this has been a bit bumpy and is still under development, but to some degree, it appears to be working.\u00a0 It needs some work to organise and educate about the methodology and the time and self discipline of individuals to ensure that there is really good documentation (comprehensive updates of work done / work that needs doing).\n\nHere is the 'working' page on the OSE wiki\n\nhttp://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Flashy_XM\n\nThe great thing about this methodology is that, if done right, it facilitates swarming on the work load.\u00a0 If people see value they can take on and complete tasks.\u00a0 Tasks are made as small as possible so its easy to complete.\n\nGet enough people intersted in your work, organise well and then be amazed at how quickly things happen.\n\nBest\n\nDarren\n\nPS that is the second time an Edgeryder has mentioned 'Project of How' to me in less than 12 hours.... guess I'm going to have to take a good look.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-15 10:17:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:44.643998", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 360, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9057], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77632, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13694, "post_number": 2, "raw": "", "created_at": "2020-05-28 14:34:16.307052", "updated_at": "2020-05-28 14:34:16.307052", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50007, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6047, "post_number": 33, "raw": "You do that, @jasen_lakic.

If we are to have documentation about leadership, let's make it right. Additionally, I want to answer the question that Anique asks me about \"forming a team\".\n\n### 1. The following statement does not match with what I know\n\n[quote=\"anique.yael, post:1, topic:9203\"]\nLesson one: Who does the work doesn\u2019t necessarily call the shots\n[/quote]\n\nLet's see. \n\n* The Edgeryders company, with a board vote in summer 2017, decided to put up some money and some of my (unpaid) time to set up the [Edgeryders Research Network](http:///t/9116). The network is supposed to make money by doing research, but it has additional strategic imperatives. One is connecting the outliers (\"people on the edge\") to the center of our societal governance (large orgs like the European Commission). Another is create meaningful work opportunities for people in the community. These imperatives are Edgeryders (and myself in particular) calling the shots, on the basis that it and I did the work of creating and maintaining the RezNet.\n\n* The research network hub, @anique.yael and myself, after talking to many people in the community and outside of it, made the final call about which calls to invest in (\"invest\": spend time and money building consortia and writing proposals), and then spent our own time doing it. We did not ask for the board's permission, nor should we have done so, because [\"all the intentionality is at the level of the projects\"](http:///t/8729). So, we did the work and called the shots. We are continuing to do so in the 2019 campaign.\n\n* In that phase (early 2018), we asked some people, called \"team leaders\" in the post, to commit to certain KPIs (\"if we get you 15K for engagement, can you get me 350 participants?\"). This was necessary, because quantitative indicators are a requirement of writing H2020 proposals. Team leaders are, as Anique writes, people who have built up experience doing this kind of thing. The deal is: they take responsibility for delivering on those targets and those budgets (they \"do the work); in return, they get to choose how to allocate the budgets, who to hire etc. (they call the shots).\n\nSo, it seems to me that the situation Anique describes is one where who does the work does, indeed, call the shots. However: [quote=\"anique.yael, post:1, topic:9203\"]\nin this instance, I am not necessarily calling the shots\n[/quote]\n\nThis is true. But this is because (1) Anique did not do \"the work\" but an (important) part of it; but more importantly, because she has already moved into delivery. She is taking overall responsibility for the delivery, which means she gets to decide how we report, what internal deadlines we should meet so that the deadlines contained in the Grant Agreements are not compromised etc. But she has no jurisdiction over how we (team leaders) do what we do (and vice versa). \n\n### 2. The word \"responsibilities\" needs disambiguating\n\nAnique's text does not distinguish between two kinds of responsibilities. They may be clear to her, but if you are not familiar with EU research you might get confused. For example:\n\n[quote=\"anique.yael, post:1, topic:9203\"]\n@alberto is LSIGN which means that he is legally responsible for these projects.\n[/quote]\n\nThis is not correct. LSIGN is a role assigned to me within the EC's [Research Participants Portal](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/home.html). All it means is that I am authorized to digitally sign the grant agreement on behalf of the grant's beneficiary, Edgeryders O\u00dc. But the legal responsibility for delivering the project stays with Edgeryders, and the people called on to answer if Edgeryders fails spectacularly, or misuses funds, are its directors. \n\nIf you are curious as to why the Participants Portal uses such confusing terminology, read the paragraph below the two horizontal lines. Warning: it's not very interesting.\n\n----------\n\nThe Portal automates and rationalizes a lot of the paperwork around assigning and monitoring research grants, like for example, digitally signing grant agreements. To do this, it has a system of roles. Any legal entity can have (and normally does have) multiple users connected to it (we have three: Anique, Noemi and myself). Every legal entity _must_ have at least one user with a role called [LEAR](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/grants/applying-for-funding/register-an-organisation/lear-appointment_en.htm), which stands for \"Legal Entity Appointed Representative\". Both @noemi and I are LEARs for Edgeryders. The LEARs have the power to assign other roles, such as LSIGN, to other users in the same legal entity. The role of LEAR is given to a user by the portal's admins, upon reception of (paper) letters of appointment signed by directors, proof of ID, and legal documents proving that, indeed, Edgeryders does have directors with the same names as the people signing those letters of appointment. \n\nSo, the Commission knows that Edgeryders directors made me a LEAR; and they know that I made then myself LSIGN; and they can see that I digitally sign the agreement. So they can go up the chain of responsibilities: the signature was made by the LSIGN, who was empowered to do so by the LEAR, who was appointed by the directors, who are ultimately legally responsible for delivering the project. This whole charade is a system to pin the legal responsibility for anything done on the portal to the people whom company law says are responsible for what Edgeryders does: its directors. That's where the buck stops, as it should.\n\n\n----------\n\n[quote=\"anique.yael, post:1, topic:9203\"]\nI am written as project lead into the GAs. This means that I am the contact for the Commission, the Coordinator and our partners on these projects and I am responsible for their delivery and our corresponding reputation. [...]\n\nI will be bringing in a project coordinator to drive project management. [...]\n\nTeam leaders have been written into the proposals as responsible for the five key tasks in the main Edgeryders work package.\n[/quote]\n\n\nThis is true. However, these are all _internally assigned_ responsibilities. If any of the people mentioned in the post should decide to drop out, join a Zen monastery and never get involved with research again, that would not be a problem for the Commission, regardless of what is written in the grant agreements. The beneficiary of the grants is not a collection of physical persons, but a legal entity, Edgeryders O\u00dc. As long as it delivers good quality research and does good, timely reporting, projects go on as planned. In principle we could replace the whole team (and I have been in projects where some partners did just that). The reason why we care so much about the team is _internal_. Anique and I reasoned that there was no way that the two of us could oversee projects this big. So we decentralized them, by breaking up delivery into functions (engagement, community management etc.) and asked people with the most experience to take responsibility for them.\n\n### 3. Am I forming a data analysis team?\n\nNot right now, but there might be one at some point down the line. The data analysis we committed to doing is something I can do myself, and am very much looking forward to doing some actual data science after all this proposal writing and conference calls partaking. Also, I have no budget besides what I allocated as my own salary, so any extra person coming on board has to be paid by me foregoing part of my income. This is, however, not out of the question, especially if we get more research projects in the coming years. \n\nWhat I _am_ forming is the [digital ethnography skunkworks](http:///t/9113). I did allocate part of my budget to giving a small contract to Sander to get this done. I plan to fundraise somehow to build the DES up into a small but mean corner of Edgeryders where we do \"blue sky\" thinking and prototyping on integrating complex systems modelling with social science. @hugi and @amelia (hopefully) will be involved in this, and maybe others.\n\n4. Work package structure is unimportant\n\n[quote=\"anique.yael, post:1, topic:9203\"]\nTeam leaders have been written into the proposals as responsible for the five key tasks in the main Edgeryders work package. I have shared this model many times but to clarify it is made up of 1. community management + 2. engagement + 3. ethnography + 4. network data analysis + 5. tech support (+ 6. project management and reporting)\n[/quote]\n\nThe division into functions, each attended by a team, is correct, but work packages have got nothing to do with it. Here's why. EC funded research projects are traditionally divided into Work Packages (WPs). These are \"units of work\", themselves divided into tasks. They are essentially a narrative tool: you use them to build a high-level description of a project. I personally do not think they are particularly effective even as a narrative tool, unless the project is \"waterfall\". Waterfall projects are now considered outdated and frowned upon. With our proposals, we have tried to think instead in layers. For example OpenCare:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4032801c35f08889c3bd6118311f30a7bfbc6b01.jpeg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\nWhen we wrote the OpenCare proposal (spring 2015), we dominated it: we did 90% of the proposal writing, had the science lead and were originally the consortium leader. Each of those functions was written into its own work package, where it got integrated with the homologous functions carried out by other partners. Edgeryders had person-months and budget in _all_ work packages.\n\nIn the 2018 campaign, Anique and I took a different strategy. Instead of starting our own consortia, we joined existing ones, proposing everything we do in the concentrated form of one work package. What ended up happening is that we had to \"blend in\" a bit better with other WPs. This is a result of our success at establishing ourselves as a hard-working, dependable, intelligent partner. As the company's \"face\" in those relationship, Anique gets a big part of the credit for that. But that does not mean we do different things: what we do is still going to fall under those six headings, and then the six team leaders are still going to take responsibility for them. Or not: for example, we could have written in the proposal something wildly different, say \"fly fishing expeditions for environmental education\". That does not fall under any of the headings, so we would have had to look for someone else to take on that responsibility (while still in the phase of proposal writing, hopefully). \n\nI have been encouraging Anique to write herself into the proposals as a researcher, or facilitator, or whatever else she likes to do. As long as this helps the proposals, I think this would be a great idea. Of course, then she would have to take that responsibility in delivery too.", "created_at": "2018-11-22 12:57:03.872364", "updated_at": "2018-11-22 17:18:52.265839", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1858, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 153.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [48734], "is_reply_to": [48734], "is_liked_by": [4022, 2915, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84127, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14492, "post_number": 19, "raw": "or show me in this one how to add the picture:\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/come-meet-everyone-on-october-16-info-session-about-our-new-world-building-academy/14460\n\nI really tried.", "created_at": "2020-10-01 16:12:38.533107", "updated_at": "2020-10-01 16:12:38.533107", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [83736], "is_reply_to": [84120], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32000, "user_id": 1487, "topic_id": 1865, "post_number": 26, "raw": "<b>purpose of user profile</b>\n\nI would transform your question into a more general one: what information should be included in the user profiles that can help in displaying EdgeRyders members to the outside world?\n\nThis question pertains not only to crowdfunding, but also to the consulting business model.

Usually they are a way for communities to share WIFI connectivity with each other and in many cases these mesh networks are run by communities as a means of free Internet connection within an area, or at least cheaper Internet connection within an area. Mesh networks can also be found within companies for more local infrastructure, these are seldomly, by those active in the mesh network scene, considered mesh networks though. \n\nWhat\u2019s specifically interesting is when you take mesh networks in combination with peer-to-peer protocols, such as [Scuttlebutt](www.scuttlebutt.nz) or the [DAT-protocol](https://datproject.org/) as new features are enabled, seldomly else even imagined. They happen to fit very well together as the two technologies merge and creating something quite unique:\n\nSome interesting use qualities are,\n-  offline communication\n    Communication which can happen in the same geographical region without requiring http/\"The Internet\". Be that file sharing, such as in the case of dat or actual person to person communication such as in the case of SSB. \n- Free Data - The only cost is the hardware, hardware similar to the ones already found in almost every single household in western society. \n- More private data, less vulnerability - As the data is stored locally there's a much smaller risk in terms of third party infringement, be that in the form of a data leak such as [the facebook scandal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2018/04/04/facebook-says-data-on-87-million-people-may-have-been-shared-in-cambridge-analytica-leak/1) \n\n\nI\u2019m currently looking at use cases for these technologies and have sketched out three different areas for these kinds of implementations. \n\n1) Underdeveloped regions where infrastructure are not always available. Having mesh networks in combination with peer-to-peer enables for communication through WIFI and that communication can still happen.\n\n2) Local communities, it\u2019s very efficient means for communication, for example for eco villages, off-grid living - mesh networks are ideal. \n\n\n3) Privacy / National Infrastructure Security - We are seeing a rise of cyber security attacks, specifically cyber security attacks which are targeting national and corporate infrastrucutre - [taking communities and entire nations offline](https://nordic.businessinsider.com/can-hackers-take-entire-countries-offline-2018-12). Mesh networks in combination with peer-to-peer protocols could be a solution for a lot of privacy issues that we are currently seeing in contemporary society.\n\nIf mesh networks and peer-to-peer protocols are implemented, especially in combination with each other, it would be a much more durable communciation infrastructure for society. This also goes for company infrastructures and the flaws that we see - as a means for both international, and business2business espionage is happening via cyber platforms.\n\nIf companies use and communicate via meshnets and peer-to-peer it is safer and not as easy to hijack.\n\nOne of the biggest saefty issues in terms of privacy is also human errors, some of those issues are eliminated with peer-to-peer solutions. Passwords are eliminated. User IDs and device are tied to each other. A hacker would actually have to have physical access to someones device or gain their private keys rather than password accounts which is more easily cracked.\n\n\nCurrently there are a lot of different mesh networks in the world. I do not have a complete overview at the moment. Guifi covers most of southern Europe. Freifunk is a big one in Germany. Then we have some areas in Greece which communicates via satellite connections, but local ones.\n\nThose are the most interesting ones right now. There are actually no examples as of now having mesh networks plus peer-to-peer protocols implemented at the same time.\n\nIn regards to specifically Sweden and the Nordic region I am in looking into this right now. I am keen to explore this as with the three target areas mentioned above. On one hand our communication infrastructure is not as durable as we would like to think. Both seen through examples as in Northern Sweden as infrastructure can be down and out for longer time periods when there is snow for example. Also with cases when there is highly fragile infrastructure which from a cyber security perspective can be taken offline entirely by a small team of 5 qualified hackers.\n\n__________________\nThis research is funded by the EU fund [Designscapes](http://designscapes.eu/) for exploring the implementation of mesh+P2P in Northern Europe.

I couldn't believe that such a scenario of \u201cconnecting everything with everything\u201d was now being put forward as a positive systemic framework for the entire planet.\n\nRealizing that the desired outcome was individuating all objects and embedding reading and sensing capabilities in a subgroup, I started looking into the Electronic Product Code (EPC) Global Object Name Service (ONS) schemes of building an ONS for all objects and goods. I saw hardware costs fracture and hardware boards in cheap print, and I found myself in a very curious state from 2000 to 2004. Then RepRap, the brainchild of Adrian Bowyer (later giftwrapped by MIT as Fab Lab), hit the street, and open hardware 3D printing started taking over manufacturing.\n\nIn response, I cofounded Bricolabs in 2004 with Denis \u201cJaromil\u201d Roio of [dyne.org](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/dyne.org), Felipe Fonseca of MetaReciclagem, Bronac Ferran of the Arts Council England, and Matt Ratto ([http://criticalmaking.com](http://criticalmaking.com/)). Hackers and activists began to formulate positive visions of agency over this space (https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/brico). One example of such agency is the Dowse network appliance ([http://dowse.eu](http://dowse.eu/)), a building-block resulting from the work of [dyne.org](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/dyne.org). At the time, I would think to myself, \u201cOK, there is a Matrix plan. It is un-hackable. It is like air. Should we go off the grid? Or do we have our own agency?\u201d \n\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8090451", "created_at": "2019-05-30 13:29:04.665921", "updated_at": "2019-05-30 13:29:04.665921", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 296, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 69.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [54217], "is_liked_by": [4022, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66040, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11960, "post_number": 4, "raw": "ok, will start doing that tomorrow :)", "created_at": "2019-11-27 16:12:13.944249", "updated_at": "2019-11-27 16:12:13.944249", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [66039], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41763, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 8077, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Thanks.

Most of the time I decide what we eat when I go to pick up the ingredients for that evening on my way back from the studio. I am not a huge fan of recipes, so I get inspired on the spot. Halv of the time we cook enough for one or both of us to take the leftover with us to work the next morning. But not all leftovers are easily packed or reheated. Sometimes we forget our lunch box back home...sometimes 2 or 3 times in a row and after that the leftovers sometimes have to be thrown out. And at least once a week meetings or projects lead to one of us not comin home in time for dinner. \n\nNow both of us are home. We can plan our meals, including breakfast, lunch and dinner with the security that both of us are going to be around. Instead of between 1 and 2 hours of travel per day each we have now some more time to plan, prepare and especially store food. I find it a lot easier to reduce food waste and make long term and healthy food decisions and plans now that we are both at home. \n\n**Do others share this experience? \nCan you maybe share some of your tips for storing and heating up leftovers or planning the meal plan for a few days?** \n\n*Learning how to do these things and maintaining them is a lot more effort when everyone leaves the house for work during the week.

In my case, I was a founding member and equipment officer at one society and secretary of another - both experiences are listed on, and bolster, my CV.\n\nTrue enough that socialisation at university can get wearisome if you find your shared interests with your peers waning (in your case, football; in my case, drinking, partying, etc.) - but we can all weather that, eh? :)\n\nWith regards to socialisation and the power-relationship between student and tutor - for many young people, this will be the first chance they have had where they can socialise with someone who has a superior position to them in terms of power-relationships. When students get to know a lecturer well, the power-relationship becomes demystified and the superior party humanised. In future, this will hopefully allow them to be more free-thinking and expressive around figures in their life with a higher power relationship (managers, for instance), rather than being easily cowed into silence when they have something useful to say.\n\nThat being said, I think that most students who have been to college (rather than sixth-form, which I don't believe offers the same social experience) will have had such experiences anyway.\n\nThis experience, I think, <i>can</i> be offered at a distance-learning institution. If you ever have had acquaintances with whom you have been in contact for a long time solely through email/forums/phone, and with whom you <i>eventually</i> met in person, then you may recognise that the act of meeting does change your experience and interactions with that person. Regularity of meeting helps with this.\n\nI don't think it's an insurmountable barrier, but neither is it one that can be easily overlooked.\n\nMain question on this note is whether or nor socialisation is an actual part of the purpose of university. If it is not, then it isn't something that needs be worried about with regards to distance-learning institutions (or digital, or virtual, or remote).\n\nIf it is, then it's unfair to easily dismiss such concerns as handwaving.\n\nMy view?

I want to make a quick note of what I saw, since it relates to our reflection around [The Reef](/t/6239).\n\n![image|244x345](upload://6uDY8HvvPCE5ok4SNlDt2Nyy5MF.jpeg) \n\nBackground: Vienna is, even today, unique. A large percentage (about 20%) of all apartments for rent in the city are owned by the municipality (*Gemeinde Wien*). Additionally, they are not concentrated in one or few low income areas, but are scattered all across the city. There are no ghettos in Vienna. \n\nThe foundations for this state of affairs were laid in a short period, from 1919 to 1933, called \"Red Vienna\". Here is how I understand the situation:\n\n* The Austrian Empire loses World War 1 and much of its territory. It morphs into a federal republic and turns to socialism. Socialist ideas spread: about the dignity of man, the centrality of urban workers in society, and the role of the state in bringing about a new kind of society. The Socialist party wins a majority in the federal parliament.\n\n* In 1919, it loses control of the federal government, but maintains  a high consensus in Vienna (about 50% of votes throughout the period preceding Austria's assimilation into Nazi Germany). Socialists refocus on Vienna as the cradle of their utopia. \n\n* Meanwhile, post-war hyperinflation has swept away public debt. \n\n* Rent controls are established in 1917. This ends real estate speculation and leads to falling real estate prices.\n\n* In 1922 Vienna is separated from the rest of Lower Austria, and becomes its own state (*Land*). It can now levy its own taxes. This enables a radical, and very successful, fiscal policy:\n\n    > These taxes were imposed on luxury: on riding-horses, large private cars, servants in private households, and hotel rooms. (To demonstrate the practical effect of these new taxes, the municipality published a list of social institutions that could be financed by the servants tax the Vienna branch of the Rothschild family had to pay.)\n    >\n    > Another new tax, the *Wohnbausteuer* (Housing Construction Tax), was also structured as a [progressive tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax), i.e. levied in rising percentages. The income from this tax was used to finance the municipality's extensive housing programme. Therefore, many *[Gemeindebauten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemeindebau)* today still bear the inscription: *Erbaut aus den Mitteln der Wohnbausteuer* (built from the proceeds of the Housing Construction Tax). ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Vienna))\n\n* Red Vienna deploys substantial intellectual firepower. Socialists mobilize Freud, Adler, Popper, G\u00f6del, Loos, Neurath and others, and offer them seats on boards of research- and policy institutions. The exhibition has an impressive visualization of the *Netzwerk Intelligenz*, showing how these intellectuals worked with one another in various organizations contributing to the city's governance.\n\n    ![netzwerk_intelligenz|690x485](upload://aOM05xXndgNKOFpDX4FxEnThi63.jpeg) \n\n* Red Vienna works across the policy spectrum to implement the socialist vision: education reform, social services, health care, green areas. Housing is a central concern. In fact, Viennese citizens had not been waiting around for socialist leaders to make up their minds, and had taken that matter into their own hands.\n\n    > Following the war, thousands of \"wild\" settlers occupy land on the periphery of Vienna, where they erect simple dwellings and grow gardens for their food. Emerging from this is the cooperative-oriented Viennese settler movement. Architects and intellectuals, such as Adolf Loos, Margarete Lihotzky, and Otto Neurath see a new democratic way of living in the simplicity and functionality of settlement houses. \n\n* In a very creative move, the city government decides to support, rather than repress, this movement:\n\n    > In order to guide the settlement activity and certainly also to control it politically, the municipality provides the settlers financial and technical support beginning in 1920. By 1933, roughly 8,000 settlement houses had been built in Vienna.\n\n* In 1923 Red Vienna moves beyond surfing the wave of the settlements movement, and rolls out a full-fledged strategy. It consists of the already mentioned _Wohnbausteuer_, earmarked to finance the city's affordable, high-quality housing strategy, and of a construction plan. The latter is another innovation:\n\n    > \"New Vienna\" is not developed as residential estates in the periphery, as is the favored practice internationally, but unstead, is integrated into the existing city in the form of several-story \"people's apartment buildings\". [...] All of the rooms are furnished with windows, and all of the apartment have running water and toilets. Their rather moderate dimensions are extended by communal spaces, such as laundry rooms and baths. **Until 1933 approximately 380 council housing buildings are constructed, with more than 60,000 apartments able to house 200,000 people.** \n\nSo, in less than 15 years, Vienna built 60,000 apartments, *plus* 80,000 settlement houses. Assuming an average of 4 inhabitants per house, this means lodging 200,000 people with the New Vienna program + 320,000 people with the bottom-up settlements. This runs up to 520,000 people... in a city of 1,700,000 inhabitants! They represented a huge increase in the quality of urban life, and in that of Vienna's landscape. This increase was permanent: almost all lodgings are still in use today, 100 years after Red Vienna, and Vienna is always topping the charts of the most livable cities in the world. This, despite the Nazis ending Red Vienna in civil war and ultimately annexation in 1933. \n\nThere are so many valuable lessons in here that I do not even know where to start. It would be worth looking deeper into the matter. Unfortunately many sources are available only in German. Does anyone have any insights to offer?!\n\n*Photo credits: Wikimedia commons, catalogue cover, author's photo*", "created_at": "2019-06-23 15:57:21.688766", "updated_at": "2019-06-24 10:36:44.386570", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 972, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 719.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4022, 1520, 3293], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64946, "user_id": 5757, "topic_id": 11684, "post_number": 1, "raw": "R\u00e1da bych se s V\u00e1mi pod\u011blila o p\u0159\u00edb\u011bh vztahuj\u00edc\u00ed se k l\u00e9ka\u0159sk\u00e9 p\u00e9\u010di v \u010cesk\u00e9 republice.

It has been used to deploy similar processes for the World Bank, UNDP, EU funded research project\n\n### Why this, why now?\n*section text cocreated with @jean_russell, inspired by an older text contributed by @hexayurt* \n\nHow we have been organizing resources and markets so humans have food on the table and a roof over their head has proven to be fragile in the midst of a pandemic. Most complex challenges (like getting food on the table for your family from a hundred sources and locations), are not one well-defined problem (grow apples), but a constellation of interdependent issues (transportation logistics, factory sorting and processing, demand & supply negotiations, regulation etc) undergoing constant redefinition and renegotiation. Any one organisation, no matter how efficient and smart, has no hope of containing any such challenge.\n\nAt the same time we see that in the face of large shocks to the system, organisations optimised for efficiency and profit cannot provide the means for material, relational, and existential resilience of neither individual nor society at large. Case in point: When supply chains are broken, even benevolent governments in affluent countries cannot access the equipment or protective gear to protect frontline workers on which we all depend to stay alive.\n\nOn the other hand, communities are getting smarter. The Internet has produced decentralized, scalable tools for coordination, archiving, and retrieval. It has also spawned cultural practices and ethical rules that incentivize people to collaborate with strangers. As a result, leaderless \"swarms\" of dedicated citizen experts are writing encyclopedias, mapping the Earth, doing science, developing and maintaining complex, successful software stacks. In each of these areas they outperform powerful businesses and government initiatives. \n\nThese initiatives display uncanny speed and efficiency, because communities are better than organizational hierarchies at making use of human intelligence. They treat every person \u2013 not just the top echelon \u2013 as a potential or actual expert, rather than as a passive consumer or beneficiary. They ask people to help, rather than charting their needs, and they have more human talent to throw at problems. They weed out under-performing initiatives in a healthy and natural way, making way for new life to emerge.\n\nWikipedia\u2019s a good example of the combined power of Smart Swarms to change the world. We all use it every day, and it\u2019s taking effective action on both poverty (poor people are using it too, all over the world!) and ecology (it\u2019s saving huge numbers of trees on paper books.) People are working together to solve a real human problem - access to knowledge - and it\u2019s improving everyone\u2019s lives. There\u2019s a tiny thread of financial capital \u2013 running the servers, say \u2013 but Wikipedia is a community-driven enterprise. It shows what can be done.\n\nWe want to achieve resilient lives and livelihoods. Contributing to Wikipedia doesn\u2019t put food on the table or ensure that communities support one another to mitigate the consequences of social distancing. Or even keep our mental health intact when automation wipes out the need for many professions, the foundation on which many of us build our identity and sense of purpose. We need to use a similar kind of effect to meet the material, relational, and existential needs of individuals and communities. And we need to develop sources of prosperity that secure their resilience by serving these needs.\n\nThis is not just semantics: it is about reframing livelihood generation from a lonely, competitive activity that only is accessible if you have money to sustain yourself while you build your business or have specialised training. To one that is collaborative, mutualistic, and accessible to all, regardless of your personal background. We frame the building of sustainable economic livelihoods as that of building an ecosystem, made up of many overlapping circles of people engaging in different activities. Commercial activity always relied on cooperation more than competition (but that was called an old boys club).\n\nThis summit is part of a series of activities aimed at co-designing experimental new social, business and investment models to withstand the shocks which will besoon be upon us as climate crisis and ecological devastation unfold. Ecosystems of economic resilience and regeneration.\n\n### About the Organisers\n\n* The Edgeryders organisation was created in 2012.

That is that the outputs they generate compensate people sufficiently for inputs required to get the projects off the ground...and keep them there. This means better understanding which social mix is needed, and how to make it worthwhile for those profiles to make an investment into the initiative. So far what seems to work is actually building projects like OpenCare which bring bridging and linking capacity.\n\nThey also serve to offset some (far from of the main hidden costs involved in doing this: coordination, helping people improve their communication skills and fundraising/sales.\n\nMaybe it makes sense to take the opportunity to think about the above in the context of OpenCare, make some strategic changes/improvements in how we do things based on our hypotheses..and if the results are promising then see how we can build them into the platform at large?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-10 09:38:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:48.174567", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 321, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30170], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50162, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 9340, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2019-01-18 11:58:09.308323", "updated_at": "2019-01-18 11:58:09.308323", "deleted_at": "2019-01-22 13:58:19.268460", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 545, "user_id": 3448, "topic_id": 512, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\"><strong>T-shirts 4 Open Communication</strong></h2>\n\nMain aspect of this project is to create an environment that deaf people can open up to the world through T-shirts...\n\nMore people use T-shirts, deaf people have a voice.

The title and number of the action as per the GA\n        2. The beneficiary full name\n        3. Full name, data signature of the person\n        4. Number of hours worked in a monthly time period\n        5. Supervisor full name and signature\n        6. Reference to the action tasks and WP of annex 1\n\n* Costs to be eligible\n\n    * Incurred directly\n    * Reasonable and justified\n    * Keep all the documents up to 5 years after the end \n\n**In our discussion specifically on the tool Edgeryders is building,** Silvia mentioned that as long as all necessary details (1-6 above and pasted again below) are included, it should be fine for reporting just the % of time worked (that is equal to hours worked) rather than logging each hour. To reiterate:\n\n1. **The title and number of the action as per the GA**\n2. **The beneficiary full name**\n3. **Full name, data signature of the person**\n4. **Number of hours worked in a monthly time period**\n5. **Supervisor full name and signature**\n6. **Reference to the action tasks and WP of annex 1**\n\nI have asked for confirmation that is correct. What this means is that if technically it's posstible, we won't need to get everyone to record every hour spent but can rather just submit the % of time they are contracted to work and then we can calculate/ automate that as a number of hours. This is what UCL's staff do in fact - where Richard just writes that he worked on a Task and then the staff calculate how many hours that should have been. So I've asked for absolute confirmation that if we create an automation such that the % of time allocated to the person calculates the hours worked in a monthly time period and that is what is logged rather than actual hours will that suffice. Keeping all this in mind that we still need to make sure that the Free Agent data can be exported into a spreadsheet for the Coordinators should they require it.\n\nIn any case I'd like us to do a test export of the data in a spreadsheet with you before we finalise the tool. Let's wait to hear from Silvia on this before doing so. \n\nYou can take a look at the European timesheet template and an example of Richard's [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1S4a4w2OYPP4ogSgVTHqsTcGpVWkf-7Ny)\n\nMake sense?", "created_at": "2019-01-18 11:31:54.019595", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 14:48:43.436810", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 516, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 27.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [49696], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73576, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13013, "post_number": 26, "raw": "have a look at this crowd - maybe worthwhile reaching out and inviting them? https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/fighting-coronavirus-a-new-infection-alarm-system-on-your-smartphone-a-b4b35e3c-6499-4487-a689-6008d8d7ecc8", "created_at": "2020-04-04 12:08:12.509721", "updated_at": "2020-04-04 12:08:12.509721", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 35, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [73574], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74531, "user_id": 6417, "topic_id": 13249, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm Andreja and I'm the new EarthOS unit coordinator.\n\nSo I would like to share with you some information about the funding possibilities within the new **COSME call for proposals Social Economy Missions**, https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/cosme/wp-call/call-fiche_cos-sme-2020-4-01_en.pdf and new LIFE calls.

So this call is no longer for SMEs but for regional and local authorities with similar social economy priorities and accompanied by regional and local social economy stakeholders (social enterprises, cooperatives, SMEs, etc.). Networks and umbrella organisations at various levels (European, national, inter-regional, regional, local) active in the field of social economy will be invited to enrich the missions\u2019 exchanges and mutual learning within the established partnerships, including new, innovative approaches. The \u201csocial economy missions\u201d will help to gradually build an ecosystem of players, encouraging the interaction between different partners both at public and private level and thus contributing to development of the European social economy community.\n\nThe call will support consortia in developing inter-regional collaboration through sharing and replicating best practices and inter-regional learning, and create opportunities and incentives for future inter-regional partnerships in the field of priorities of \u201cSocial economy missions\u201d.\n\n**The specific objectives** to be achieved through this call for proposals are:\n\n\u2022 Enhancing interaction and improving collaboration between existing social economy networks and stakeholders at regional and local level in the field of priorities of \u201cSocial economy missions\u201d;\n\n\u2022 Boosting inter-regional learning between social economy stakeholders (public and private sector) in the field of priorities of \u201cSocial economy missions\u201d;\n\n\u2022 Contributing to a gradual building of a Social Economy community.\n\n**Deadline** for submitting applications **9 June 2020** (indicative starting date of the action February 2021).\n\nThe total budget earmarked for the co-financing of projects is estimated at EUR 1 900 000. The maximum grant per project will be EUR 100.000. EASME expects to fund 19 proposals.\n\n**Eligible applicants** must be legal entities forming a consortium. The coordinator must be a regional or local public administration (such as municipality, city, region, etc.).\n\n**Eligible consortia** must include at least three different regional or local public administration (such as municipality, city, region, etc.) from three different EU Member States or countries.\n\nIn addition to the minimum number of required consortium partners, the following organisations can participate as consortium partners:\n\n\u2022 Network or umbrella organisations in the field of social economy or social entrepreneurship or related issues at inter-regional, national, EU or COSME countries\u2019 level.\n\n**Possible topics** can be: 1. Building resilient regional and/or local ecosystems; 2. Socially responsible public procurement; 3. Building Clusters of Social and Ecological Innovation or participation in traditional clusters; 4. Support to social economy business development; 5. Support to local and regional initiatives in the area of green and digital transition; 6. Local or regional measures tackling unemployment; 7. Sustainable agriculture and rural development; 8. Education and training to develop the social economy ecosystem; 9. The development of horizontal policies to support social economy at local or regional level; 10. Social economy initiatives to integrate migrants; 11. Other (identified by the applicants).\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n Minimum requirements for outputs of \u201csocial economy missions\u201d include: a) Three workshops b) Three workshop reports with good practices in the field of priority of \u201csocial economy mission\u201d as stipulated in the section 2.3, and published at the Social Economy Community collaborative website in requested templates; c) Final report.", "created_at": "2020-04-17 12:25:18.687093", "updated_at": "2020-04-22 09:38:32.661024", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 666, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 113.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4, 5, 1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5151, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5118, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Just back from our weekly community call and bringing fresh energy.\u00a0This is your weekly summary of Living on the Edge 5 and what\u2019s cooking.

May sounds academic and difficult to pronounce. \n\n**(Deep) Green / Greening Edge**\nPros: intuitive, clear, wide concept to be used in very different projects all environment related, unpretentious.\nCons: abused, not edgy, we could talk about anything.  \n\n**Terra/Geo/Gaia**\nPros: inspirational, holistic, planet related, kind of mythical (past and future).\nCons: could be linked to geo-engineering, not related to people, nerdy. \n\nAs maybe some of you already know, I'm particularly interested because I'm working at the Climate-KIC project; so, whatever we will choose it would be good for me, but I honestly lobby for the first one :D \n\nBONUS: There's [a piece of stand-up comedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W33HRc1A6c) from the 80s by George Carlin about environmentalists and the idea of save the planet. I'm very into this kind of humour and I agree about the \"people perspective\" (the punch line is \"The planet is fine. The people are f***ed.\"), that's why I'm more prone to the first option. \n\nNow, should we vote, at least one of the 3?

Clearly there are few like us but certainly there must be more. Where are our people? How do we meet up & work together?\n\n**How did you get started and what hurdles have you met along the way?** \nWe got started young, helped by [Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring) & the realization that previous generations had really screwed things up & contemporary generations seemed incapable of fixing things. Running away into the \"woods\" provided brief respite & we saw them consumed in the name of BAU development & economic progress.\n\nWarned by our *\"betters\"* that we best get in line, we rebelled becoming outcasts. We lived our lives between protesting on the streets & in the woods, self-directed education, escapist activities, freelance art work, extreme sports & running away. The shutting down of the alternative press, the rise of new media & the Internet necessitated new strategies.\n\nOur biggest hurdles involve procuring food & shelter, in both urban & rural environments. We've lost opportunities when identified as being dysfunctional to the dysfunctional system. Institutions do a good job filtering out people like us, we've done best in new programs & usually see the door slammed on our backsides to prevent more like us from entering.\n\nWe often find ourselves where none like us have gone before except in dim memory, myth or legend & none may follow for a variety of reasons. Our understanding is that this is the way the system functions to keep us separated from like-minded fellow travelers. The system appears to fear our gathering in groups, so that is what we seek.\n\n**Which doubts do you have about the work you are doing and the path forward?**\nWe work in the arts, writing fiction & nonfiction, media production & performance; the soft sciences, personal & social psychology; & technology, media production tech support & coding for a networked world. We're now developing & refining a focus on data science, AI, machine learning, & deep learning in several dimensions of sentiment analysis & data mining & data visualization.\n\nOur only doubts lie in judging the efficacy of our work. Clearly we excel in academics & production but we only seem to benefit when found useful & manageable by exploitive agents of BAU. The more our cognitive ability, theory & perception evolve the harder it becomes to find acceptance from gatekeepers.\n\nIt seems to us that the path forward lies in the intersection of the work we do, especially in collaboration, which emerges as a requirement. It's not exactly clear what that is. It appears to be like driving an unknown road at night, only able to see what's in the headlights & no further.\n\n**What kind of support would you like to offer others traveling a similar path?**\nWe prefer being open to what fellow travelers perceive as their needs in the way of support. We do not recommend our particular path to anyone & acknowledge that we may cross paths for unknowable reasons & appreciate input from people we happen to meet. Clearly, we do not know how to deal with this system. We do not know what people need.\n\nWe tend to be averse to those who revel in identifying \"enemies\" as we see that impulse emerging from paranoid-schizoid defenses and it only serves the dysfunctional system to divide us. That said, we do understand there are some very damaged & dangerous people out here that seek to exploit all they meet, we've met a few & see many on TV gaining celebrity status.

The manner in which Edgeryders LBG handled the appointment and definition of the role of <strong>non-executive</strong> directors last year is but one example that the needed competence (and additional pair of hands) to manage this transition well has so far been lacking in the executive board. Building anything new involving a lot of people is hard. Building an economically sustainable not-for-profit company that both generates revenue to reliably maintain and develop our shared community infrastructures and provides members with opportunities for paid meaningful work requires hands on, pragmatic experience from having been involved in many different kinds of organisations. It also requires an interest to be part of the day to day work, as well as the longer term strategic development. I think Patrick brings a rare mix of both as a new addition to the executive directors, and I am very happy that he has chosen to accept the invitation.\n\nAs is clearly on display (one of the less fun aspects of openness) we are going through a difficult and at times painful process.

Htis is a new eevent, not something that has been done already regularly.\n\n**The social goal as defined by climate KIC:**\n\nIncentivise to socialise with different offices, to feel like one team, but also to incentivise to come into the office instead of working from home.\n\nEvent proposal as planned by the organisation team as-is:\n\nEurovision Song contest style with main and local hosts. Programm:\n\n1. Saying hello to the different offices (30 min)\n2. Opening words CEO\n3. Ask everyone to share their achievements (through the survey (menti) while showing videos of past activities. + presentation\n4. Presentation what happens in 2020. Check out from each office.\n5. Checkout with the presentation: What Christmas dinner would your team be/have?\n\nAdditional Ideas:\n\n* Playlist from each office? (maybe phase that throughout the year, just introduce process/idea during the event that after-work music will be hosted by a different office once a month?\n* Having people in the offices draw names of coworkers and they have to write a one-paragraph characterisation of that coworker.

Since our Economy is based on fossil fuels, if we run out of oil for any reason, then factories will stop for some time. Population could increase for immigration (a war in oil producing countries?).\n\nRe steady state, it depends on what you consider as \"state\". In Goodwin model `u` and `v` are the state variables, everything else can be derived from them. `g_u` (growth, rate of change in output) is not zero when `du/dt=dv/dt = 0`, but it is constant, so the rate of the rate of change in output is zero.\n\nIn general, being in steady state imo does not mean that the system is still. You can also have varying external input functions (in our case tech and population). Usually, a state is represented only by inner variables, but, of course, inputs are part of the description of a system.\n\nRe fluctuations, I think that a fluctuating system can be considered in \"equilibrium\", even if it is not in a mathematical steady state. After all, it is steadily replicating the same behavior over and over.

I would love to be involved sometime down the line.\n\nSo, while I am wholly committed to the project I am about to share with you all, I'm also very open in sharing all that I have schemed and learned in the trust that we are working together to benefit society and ecology - so hopefully it is of use to you :recycle: :raised_hands: \n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:4, topic:8454\"]\nSo \u2026 what does your project look like? What can we learn from you? Have you documented it anywhere?\n[/quote]\n\nOn the one hand, I have set the intention to write a blog for each major chapter of our development on this website, so a lot of the more formal/clear information that I have 'documented' can be found on [this first post](https://grdnglobal.wordpress.com/2018/02/27/early-reflections/).\nThe other answer to documentation, aside from our trello board (where we now employ interstitial journalling), is that as a first iteration we are building a [database](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GdvZDsh0evdVPXT12sbEb6iRrITm46ww) which is currently open for anybody to add to or draw knowledge/inspiration from. It's a massive documentation of data, on its way toward becoming an open-access directory.\n\nThe goal is to remove the barriers which keep common citizens from taking action in their communities and empowering them with accessibility, tools, support, training and finance when it is relevant. Hence the first step is to create a directory of sorts, pointing to valuable information.\n\nAs a global body (at least in time the idea is to transcend borders), we act as an 'incubator' modelling a sort of 'venture capitalism' which I think of as venture relationalism (term pending). \n\nI mirror your insight into remodelling the collective space of home and work, and we also want to be as self sustainable as possible every step of the way. So, we have recently acquired some land in Gujraula, near New Delhi, to offer as a co-working space and to rent out in Air BnB, looking to attract nomadic entrepreneurs and grow our network. This won't be a place for residencies as your model has, though I like the idea and may try it down the line. Instead the idea is to create edge between our projects and the wider, global community of social entrepreneurs.\n\nIn this building, which is designed to showcase sustainability in many forms, we will open a rooftop cafe, growing plenty of our own food on the roof, and connecting in the emerging organic food distribution system of this area while supporting local farmers to transition portions of their land to an agroecological model. Our site will also have an auditorium space for workshops and presentations; we intend to invite locals in for monthly film screenings and hire the space out to companies who come to the industrial area for business -- this is filling a void that one local has identified.\n\nSo, basing ourselves here in the beginning, we will then flesh out the following model;\nClient A has an idea (based, at first, on one of our 5 key tension areas: education, healthcare, organic farming, waste and alternative energy), yet she has no business background and limited funding. She has heard about us from school or family, so she gets in contact.\nWe assign her a non-specialist coach. This member of our team has gone through a training programme which identifies key tools and frameworks that can fit different situations. This person is hired if they have ideally both a background in entrepreneurship or management, and communication (NVC, deep listening, etc). We supplement their business knowledge with a course and this team (the leaves) connect to a stem (a professional advisor), meaning that the flow of knowledge is providing continuous training for our leaves while not overloading the stems.\n\nMeanwhile, our root system plugs away at the level of government and investors. They seek grants, organize citizen resistance, make visible the struggles which emerge from data collected from our Clients' pitches and shuffle the legal backbones of the small projects we are supporting.\n\nOur network (The GRDN) would be financially self sufficient through the business of co-working spaces and sustainable tourism ventures, potentially even an investment in alternative energy. Yet we receive stakes in the companies which bloom under our coaching, so that revenue can build into supporting more projects and expanding into other communities. Eventually we will be able to pay local representatives who wish to start a GRDN chapter in their area. This person will collect relevant cultural data for the directory, host events to bring citizens together over empowerment and manage a team which can grow into a version of our prototype leaf-stem coaching model.\n\nHowever, we continue to apply for grants to distribute to project applicants based on criteria influenced by Effective Altruism. We use our core team to siphon donations into the most effective local projects which are still being ultimately led by and developed by locals, who obviously have the most intimate understanding of their community's needs. Yet we can choose to put a portion of this funding into courses / trainings for these local leaders, equipping them with long-term benefit (rather than taking over when they reach the limit of their existing abilities).\n\nI think this covers the main structure, if I've left anything out or you have further questions (I hope!), then we'll continue the discussion. But I am very interested to hear your feedback @alberto and @matthias or whoever else. If this is something you think you'd like to co-create then I'll gladly invite you into the Trello board; currently it is mainly myself, with a partner in India who is making connections with businessmen and politicians of the area and overseeing the co-working site, with our friend Trisha who has been helping me to categorise the directory. I'm sure some of you will have great suggestions for entries into the directory, don't be shy to add anything as the google folder is open for editing ;)  [(Here's that link again.)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GdvZDsh0evdVPXT12sbEb6iRrITm46ww)\n\nPS Permaculture works anywhere that there's an ecosystem!

We collect knowledge and practices that people in different sectors are using to keep their businesses afloat right now. People discuss and share advice with one another by leaving thoughtful comments to each article. Contributors then receive invitations to opportunities for further learning and collaboration.*\n\n*While some spaces are making their own technology, others are using household names. Some are utilising a mixture of both. Read on to learn more about the key tech players in the coworking space and what people think of acces technologies* \n\n\n## Mixed approaches\n\n\u201cAt the beginning we were using the available ones, like Nexudus.... but then along the way, looking at how coworking itself is an ecosystem builder, we thought that we stepped back a bit. We want to be the engine of all the coworking players across Indonesia\u2026 so, currently we're building our own tech platform  to connect all of those hubs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we have more than 50 hubs spreading in 26 cities, but then we are empowering them through programs. So looking at how we recover from COVID-19, we always say that the strength of coworking is not just the chair, cable, and internet. If it's like that, that means we are an internet cafe for hipsters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the strength is community activations, and then how we can always provide value to our audience. So we've been running all these programs and the partnership programs. Just last April, we did a massive startup week in Indonesia and it became the biggest in APEC, even more than China and India, because we got 1,500 people registered from 29 provinces.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, Indonesia only has 34 provinces so 29 is almost all of them. But then to be able to engage everybody from all these coworking spaces, onboarding their communities, we were using six different platforms just to manage the whole three days process.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe are using Discourse, open source forum platform, biggest one in the world, where it's connected... but we have our own part of that forum. It works great for us in terms of communicating important information.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have Simple for our membership management for payments and so on, small, small, very basic thing\u2026 we're looking to transition away from that.\u201d\n\n\u201cX, which is one of the directors of X and our main IT guy, is running a software development program which is basically aiming towards creating platforms, not specifically for coworking spaces, but it could still be relevant for you to know. It's called Participio and it's a trio at the moment of software built for participatory processes around placemaking. For example, we've received research grants of 20,000 euros from Swedish government agency to develop this. This could be interesting for you to look into if you are into that sphere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have attempted to create a sort of a shared platform in Stockholm for different corporate spaces that we feel are sort of aligned to us culturally. We haven't, thus far, been successful in this. There hasn't been very much of a drive among others to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdeas would have been, you shared access to spaces and so on and so forth. But so far we haven't, it hasn't really turned into anything concrete, which is surprising given the challenges. I think most places are overwhelmed by the challenges that they don't feel they have the bandwidth to even consider adding the complexity of this.\n\n## Coworking tech main players\n\n\u201cCobot is probably my favorite and Nexudus was the most popular for a long time. And they've tried to have every aspect included for coworking management. Cobot is coming up pretty hot now and I think most people in Europe are starting to use them, they're out of Berlin.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Nexudus, I think is out of London, UK. However, Cobot is really user-friendly. The guys are really responsive there and they work really closely with coworking spaces to develop the needs. So I would 100% recommend them and because they're so popular, they have a lot of integrations. And I do believe they're open source, but I could be wrong about that, but I know the guys personally, really awesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also put a link to Measurance. I just became familiar with them. I don't know them so well, but they have adapted theirs as well to kind of help your space mitigate the COVID issues as well, so that you can sort of like you say, survey your attendees, but also in the way of measuring temperatures and also air quality, which is really important for spaces now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they can actually measure air quality and you can look on your app and see today the space has 98% clear air or whatever. So there's all sorts of crazy stuff going on right now in response to COVID, but they also do the same, a similar thing to Cobot and Nexudus, not as developed.\u201d\n\n## Access technologies for spaces\n\n\u201cWe installed cameras maybe eight months ago or something and I mean, ironically, it's mainly around the entrances, it's not very invasive. But I find it really helps to reduce conflict and so on cause you cannot always know who it was, who forgot to lock the door, or whatever it was.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c(Kisi) is also an access tool. It's either via card or through your phone, through an app. And that's also a nice way to have for 24 hour access. It's a very affordable way to do that if you're a space that doesn't have a receptionist as well.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo people can tap in it and access the building after hours. And it always records who's coming and going and a lot of people do it through their phone as well. And it interacts with everything from elevators to front doors, to after hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they're also developing payments systems. So if you want to pay for things within the coworking space, like a chocolate bar, you can pay for it through this as well, so they are continuing to develop that. Kis is out of New York City I believe. They're German, that are located there now. They're also really tied into the scene there and they started off in coworking and now they're branching out into other sectors for the access for app and key card. Super, super effective, and very affordable option.\u201d\n\n## It\u2019s important to ask yourself why you are using said technology\n\n\u201cSo are you looking for some tech solutions that kind of bring your community together? Are you looking to manage your space and get out of your head all of the admin tasks, would you say  we're onboarding the members, invoicing, and looking into the meeting rooms, booking systems, and things like that?\u201d\n...\n## If you have any other suggestions for helpful technologies, or you are building a system yourself, please comment below.\n\n*This summary is from an event was part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016.

The first mistake is building something nobody wants. Avoiding it remains the top priority for any aspiring entrepreneur.*\n\n*Using the lean startup methodology is very useful since it\u2019s a scientific method to to discover if a proposed business model is viable based on validated learning and iterations.*\n\n*Here\u2019s a link to a short video about the lean startup methodology: https://youtu.be/X2YoHFuWkqs*\n\n*So the first thing to start with is thinking about your assumptions and hypotheses that define the problem the targeted customer segment is having and the solution you are proposing.*\n\n*Having a clear, accurate, relevant and measurable hypotheses is key to generate validated learning. This is why you should avoid having speculative hypotheses, using words like \u201clike to\u201d or \u201cinterested in\u201d because they cannot be tested later on.*\n\n*Here\u2019s an example of how your hypotheses should be formulated: *A **[Specific Person]** makes a **[Decision/Behavior]** because of a **[Quantified Metric]** .**\n\n*In the presentation that we used during the lab and that I attached to this post, you can find additional templates of hypotheses and examples of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d hypotheses.*\n\n*In addition to the problem / solution hypotheses, you should also sketch a persona. It\u2019s a made up profile of an ideal customer or what is called an early adopter; It represents a customer in the targeted customer segment. Attached you can find a persona template that you can use.*\n\n*Here\u2019s a link to a short video about how to create customer personas:  https://youtu.be/AVs59ddkzuQ*\n\n*One of the most important hypotheses is the one about your value proposition. In this respect, a value proposition is not a motto or a mission statement but rather the answer to the question: why should the customer by my product? It can be something that create gain or remove pain but in all the cases it must be considered from the customer perspective.*\n\n*There are several templates of value proposition however it would be better to draw a value proposition canvas (VPC) to help you visualize how the value you are offering matches your customers\u2019 profiles.*\n\n*Here\u2019s a link to the value proposition canvas: https://youtu.be/ReM1uqmVfP0*\n\n*Also, the value proposition canvas helps you to prepare the value proposition ad-lib template (please find the template attached).*\n\nWe had a very interesting interaction of Q&A. Questions were about value propositions in multisided platforms and apps and the choice of persona when there are several customer segments.\n\nThe main insights from the Q&A is that you should prepare a VPC for each customer segment if you have more than one and if they are different in term of needs or jobs and also if you have a multisided platform. The same applies to customer personas.\n\nA special thank to all the people who attended the lab and I hope that you found it helpful and useful.\n\nDocumentation:\n[Lab2 Presentation.pdf|attachment](upload://4cd2v0VpqgVD8yitgpln1bNpg8j.pdf) (3.0 MB) [Persona template.pdf|attachment](upload://4EWF0b1fKRMU3SBBt1lqzi6Yi3D.pdf) (60.9 KB) [value-proposition-canvas.pdf|attachment](upload://61idNb3VVEqO9ZFHV06EqpPANqy.pdf) (27.2 KB) [ad-lib-value-proposition-template.pdf|attachment](upload://yXN0tjKliVP5FGLhyQMGhwhazvn.pdf) (32.8 KB)", "created_at": "2019-12-28 17:17:58.834586", "updated_at": "2020-01-12 20:41:26.012730", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 749, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 117.8, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5538, 6048, 6078, 8, 5547, 5884, 3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50156, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 9340, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2019-01-18 11:49:30.912645", "updated_at": "2019-01-18 11:49:30.912645", "deleted_at": "2019-01-18 11:58:22.730025", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36855, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 6683, "post_number": 32, "raw": "I encourage everyone to sign up for tasks here\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/join-a-team/7170\n\n@nabeel_p @alex_levene (just double check) and the rest of the folks coming over", "created_at": "2017-09-23 11:32:53.548870", "updated_at": "2017-09-23 11:32:53.548870", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 40, "score": 23.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [36808], "is_reply_to": [36732], "is_liked_by": [3769], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39992, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 503, "post_number": 9, "raw": "My experience at this point was more to do with what was happening within the volunteer community, rather than with the refugee community.\nThere were at that time a lot of long-term volunteers who were working themselves into the ground, providing nearly 24hr support 7 days a week to refugees on the camp. People were refusing to take time off, or to properly take care of themselves, causing massive burnout. The refugees were (with some exceptions) better at dealing with the situation and seeking help when i was available. Many did not take part in therapy sessions because to them the trauma was still ongoing. It's hard to process what you've gone through when you are still on that pathway.\n\nMy opinion is this was largely down to misplaced guilt (why should i take time out from this when the refugees can't?) and/or the sense that they were operating at a level above the need for support (low level volunteers getting training on stress management, but long term project leaders not attending meeting because there were 'too busy')\n\nThe situation in Calais was very unique to that context, and has now changed completely.\n\nThere is an interesting insight into the end of the camp here, with interviews with lots of volunteers i worked alongside: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw6lbhcdbdI  You can see from their interviews a small amount of the problem.", "created_at": "2017-12-05 16:02:40.940815", "updated_at": "2017-12-05 16:02:40.940815", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 238, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 51.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [39985], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52997, "user_id": 4970, "topic_id": 9807, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Congratulations \n[@MariaEuler](https://edgeryders.eu/u/mariaeuler) and thank you @noemi for acknowledgement.

There is no \"we\". I can only talk for myself. People that I meet align than go elsewhere. We share a sensibility, that is all. When that converges you get a certain idea of where the keys to change are. None of what I have written was 'engineered', it all happened, like it is happening now.\n\nSo I speak for me.\n\nAs we are part of a project that works with public money, you, me, must  believe in this public space, otherwise we would not be in it. I believe in it to the extent that I can be a real agent in trying to change it. That is what I am trying to achieve with the invite only expert workshops in the Taskforces, to build a common understanding that there is no escape from this transition and that leadership means taking control of the drivers. I get very good input and feedback, a lot of gov and biz are beginning to see the world will consist of a few large ecosystems and we can shape ours. Every situation is historical and full of opportunity of change. Thinking the course is set is not for people in a strategy group, but for people who are afraid and want to escape.\n\nOn the parallel systems: here \u2039we see the LEDGER space opening up and with DECODE and Jaromil led zenroom (see decodeproject.eu) ideas about data, privacy, security are no longer niche but getting traction, alongside the awareness that is build with dowse.eu. I am talking with hardcore thinkers like Stephan Engberg who too thinks we need to rebuild bottom-up - literally aiming to replace/upgrade almost all standards. And I fully agree. But I do not want to do that for one village, or one group of people and that means that without agency on the system as such we can not change its drivers or slow it down. And besides, this is the Borg we are engulfed in, there is not one location on the planet of the grid that will remain 'free' (which is why Moneyland aims to go to the Moon/Mars).And we need to slow it down as the world is now clocking in on a crazy Silicon Valley individualist start start start up mode. We need to take back our own pace.\n\nOn Arduino: I wads around when that started from IVREA Design School, as a great educational project of building a micro processor as a design challenge that turned out to be a great prototyping platform on the PROCESSINg of Casey Reas.\nhttps://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Credits\nArduino brilliantly steered this design object into a fully open source environment tuned to makers first https://www.fastcompany.com/3025320/how-arduino-is-becoming-the-worlds-social-network-for-hackers-and-makers and then, now to partnering with Intel and ARM.\nIn a way they have become a quite normal IoT company. Being close to them I can contact them quickly when Council members in Lagos want training, for example.\nI am very happy to hear more from Banzi but I think connected devices is just another name for the kind of connectivity that is IoT.\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/2019/05/18/arduino-nano-boards/\n\n\"Some argue that the maker movement may have passed its peak and is now moving away from microelectronics, but Banzi is not convinced. \u201cHere in Europe, the maker scene is different from California where it is closely related to artists, hackers, and the local fringe culture. In Europe, there is a lot of overlap between makers and small and medium enterprises. A lot of these small companies run using maker methodologies. For instance, if they don\u2019t have the money for expensive machinery, they build their own do\u2011it\u2011yourself solutions using maker tools.\u201d\"\n\nhttps://www.u-blox.com/en/blog/innovation/discussion-makers-arduino\u2019s-massimo-banzi\n\nSo yes I am very interested in new network topologies, in breaking tcp-ip, in  investigating networks that connect only to each other at the edge, no central node, no server architecture 'systems' like https://smarimccarthy.is/articles/2012-08-24-centralization-vs-decentralization-two-centuries-of-authority-in-design/\n\nAnd we have money in NGI to fund these ideas, so if you know of hackers and ciders who want to investigate these types of new connectivities please send three to me so we can help them broker proposals.\n\nOn Adam:\n\nI have known Adam for over 15 years. He first reached out to me when I was working as Flow editor with John Thackara on Doors of Perception:\nhttp://flow.doorsofperception.com\nIncidentally that is where I laid the foundation for a large part of my understanding of what is now #IOT meeting for example my good friend Usman Haque from Pachube (as no EU VC was found -typically-  forced to sell to US VC Logmein, Xively and now oh irony: Google).\nSince then we met in Taiwan where I went with him on one of his very good and productive city walks, set next to him in meetings where he was astonished how I could sit all day through these awful ppt presentations indeed of IoT architectures (I told him I daydream) and had him invited (with Alex Bassi) to speak to the entire IERC and IOT Forum community in 2012 in Venice https://iotweek.org/speaker/adam-greenfield/\nHe then presented a set of slides which consisted purely of the marketing ppt of all major companies. Her thought that would wake up the crowd, the IoT community, all they saw was someone playing back the same hype that the marketeers in their own HQS were building that none of them believed as well. Adam thought he was 'critical' in the lions den. It had no effect at all. I was in the audience with the engineers, in the projects, working hard as one of the team and I saw this firsthand. \nIt had no effect as I predicted that in the 2007 text. You can not fight an ontological change with toolsets from the old paradigm. The only way, simple Bucky, is to build a new one alongside it. All else, flight, escape, protest, hacks, simply strengthens the funders and vested interests, in fact by opposing them you give them fuel to hold out a bit longer. But OK! I still respect that position, a lot. A kind of similar attempt is done by Aral Balkan and Schrecko Horvath and DIEM who also think I have gone over to the dark side when I try to expose my ideas to them that include working with current gov and current big tech and SME and hackers and.....in order to build a smart society - if it has to be smart -  then preferably a smart society for all and not just for the rich or the hipsters.\nIoT is a basic operation of automation started from the Industrial Revolution with a logic that seems to be of its own and whoever denies that it is real, but that it is marketing at this moment is totally irresponsible towards the younger generations the Igens and Millennials on their devices all the time, rapidly growing up in a fully engineered AR and VR fed Matrix.  Anyone doing that for really good personal reasons and from an old worn through position like Adam I respect. Anyone voicing that position now makes him or herself fully irrelevant, niche and in my opinion romantically escapist.\n\nInterested in a pragmatic approach:\nFree e-book\nhttps://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642404023", "created_at": "2019-06-01 07:37:43.227745", "updated_at": "2019-06-01 07:37:43.227745", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1276, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 103.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3111, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 3078, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2014-05-29 11:29:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:17.269208", "deleted_at": "2017-09-17 11:37:44.331176", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49970, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9327, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Absent guidance I would say something like, \"good community management uses a variety of techniques to bring out the best in the participants while minimizing problems.

He concludes that zero growth requires tight controls on the size of the labor force. The society implied by the model's mathematical conditions for zero growth is so different from ours that it would indeed take a sci-fi novel to describe it \u2013 call it \"cyberpunk dystopia\". \n\n* We observed that it could be interesting to use the zero-growth Goodwin model as a playground for developing our collective modeling muscle. We discussed one variation and one extension.\n* The variation is: *decreasing* labor force, *increasing* labor productivity. This would be a Jackpot world (in the sense of William Gibson's *The peripheral*: the Jackpot is the multi-causal, 40 years-long apocalypse described in the novel). People die off, output stays the same, but productivity increases, so that unemployment does not necessarily increase as a consequence of zero growth. This can be explored by tweaking the parameters of Marco's model.\n* The extension is: decreasing *the number of hours worked per unit of time*, with *increasing* productivity of labor. This is a zero-growth Keynesian world (in the sense of *Economic perspectives for our grandchildren*, 1930), characterized by a lot of leisure time. It is a world shadowed partially of Doctorow's *Walkaway* (getting a shift at the bar in the Belt and Bracers is a privilege, and there are always more people who want to do it than available slots). This requires writing some code to decouple the number of people alive from the number of  person-hours offered on the labor market.\n* We next had a discussion on the modelling strategy, prompted by @Karl's mention of doughnut economics, and how could a model like this keep track of the non-strictly economic components of prosperity. We agreed that we could explore \"implicit\" modelling. For example, in Marco's model, imposing a zero rate of growth to the Goodwin model is a proxy for achieving sustainability. It is very economical: instead of making a complicated set of equations, you just assume that the economy is small enough for the the carrying capacity of the planet, and then you set it so it will never grow. Shortening the working week is a proxy for shifting to non-material consumption. This way, we may not need to grift endogenous preferences  at all, because we just simulate them by imposing a shorter working week. \n\nAction points:\n\n* @mstn to publish his work on GitHub (includes running code for the zero-growth Goodwin model).\n* @alberto (and whoever else is interested) to start working on the extension.\n* @Karl (and whoever else is interested) to consider interpretations and how best to read the model's conclusions in light of the current large-scale economic trends (in the world, not in the model).\n\nMy apologies to @fjanss, whose message I saw too late to welcome him here in Brussels.", "created_at": "2019-12-16 18:50:49.027913", "updated_at": "2019-12-16 18:52:23.132702", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 492, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 36.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 1514], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79222, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9766, "post_number": 36, "raw": "[quote=\"VladiKup, post:33, topic:9766\"]\nssue: it takes time to explain to (legacy/stubborn/greedy) publishers, that they should OPEN books (&eBooks) data, to\n[/quote]\n\n\nHello @VladiKup, that's a very attractive model.

In this post, I try to summarize them roughly, so that we don't forget them. \n\nThe action point is for me to call a meeting *in December* (ahead of writing the stage 2 proposal) with C-KIC, and for Matt to write two well-explained example of the type of innovations that could be developed in The Reef: emissions-saving, with a technological component and a social component. \n\nWe have always though of The Reef as a hybrid space: it is residential, but also commercial. People and small businesses live together, and exploit the resulting economies of scope (the coworking space becomes a great space for parties after 18.00, etc.). **We now propose that part of the commercial space is allocated to a university lab on green living**. The inspiration comes from [Metrolab itself](http://www.metrolab.brussels/): interdisciplinary, result of the collaboration between two Belgian universities, EU-funded. The advantages:\n\n* **Participatory climate innovation**. The Lab offers residencies to researchers wishing to develop innovation around climate-friendly urban living. The Lab itself is the \"academic home\" of the researchers, and The Reef is their living home. This means that the innovation can be field-tested in The Reef (within reason). Further, \"eat your own dog food\" is built into the innovation project, because the researcher is embedded for real into the community he is innovating for. All this makes the work of innovating much more participatory.\n\n* **Increased financial viability**. Research funding pays for the living costs of the researcher(s), who live in (one of) The Reef's guest room(s). This makes the exchange between the researchers and the permanent residents more fair; the latter help the former test her ideas, and the former pays rent, contributing to keeping the resident's living costs affordable.\n\n* **Cultural enrichment**. The Reef selects residents also on the basis of their commitment to the planet. Going to lunch/hanging out with academics is likely to contribute to the way The Reef, as a community, moves forward, for example which changes in their way of living to adopt in the near future.\n\n* **Promotes The Reef from \"just another C-KIC project\" to infrastructure for its mission**. We can ask C-KIC to go through their community and help us put together a coalition of entities that would like to be part of this Lab. Should not be a difficult sell, since they are a major climate innovation funding agency! This should accelerate the whole process, create massive legitimacy (thus justifying public sector direct involvement), and expand the range of stakeholders who have an interest in making The Reef happen.", "created_at": "2019-12-02 07:36:53.550411", "updated_at": "2019-12-02 07:36:53.550411", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 462, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 123.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 5201, 5252, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59887, "user_id": 5393, "topic_id": 10858, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Nadia, \"time is just an illusion that helps things make sense\". :stuck_out_tongue: \nI am fine and I hope you're fine as well.", "created_at": "2019-09-25 12:18:44.540629", "updated_at": "2019-09-25 12:18:44.540629", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 23, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 42.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [59874], "is_liked_by": [4, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65183, "user_id": 2536, "topic_id": 10810, "post_number": 43, "raw": "i was wondering about these points recently. great that you mention them, \n\nwe are publishing our content stories (like the ones I did with sabine and celine jamar), in this edgeryriders platform but I was wondering, are they indexed by search engines? \n\nalso, all the research we are doing with workshops and interviews, are \"discovery sessions\" that should give us good ideas for content we can create to attract visitors to the site.", "created_at": "2019-11-22 16:16:19.272187", "updated_at": "2019-11-22 16:16:19.272187", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 73, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [64233], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3074, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 3041, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bebee4234287dbd06a60eacc2e524e7a7d34cefc.png\" width=\"646\" height=\"499\"><br>\n\n<span>Our<span> 4th bi-weekly meeting will be held this Thursday at 7 pm at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bauhauscafetbilisi\">cafe Bauhaus</a> in<span> Tbilisi.</span> Feel free to drop by at anytime.

Since the cropped vertical excerpts have already a higher vertical resolution than the full-scale illustration we received, I suspect that Lorenzo's original files could be of a still higher resolution. So, two things: \n\n    * @ilaria, could you please get us the [Bespoke Illustration](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ri3m2cuPCCzuIrKQlGdTDa6_YDSI75MD) in as high a resolution as available? No cropping or scaling, simply the full thing. Preferably in addition also in its source format.\n\n    * Also for @ilaria, I think we have two or so change requests within the budget of the visuals preparation. If nobody else has a more urgent one, I'd want this: an extended version of the [Bespoke Illustration](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ri3m2cuPCCzuIrKQlGdTDa6_YDSI75MD), in as high a resolution as possible, where the illustration is extended vertically at the top so that it ends in an area that has a single whiteish-blue color left-to-right. Basically a whiteish sky of a single color at the very top, left to right. The color should be well suitable to read dark text placed on top. Aspect ratio is not important for this, just adding it to the top of the existing illustration is fine. I need that when placing it at the bottom of a content page so that I can create a smooth transition to the background color of that page. I can do it myself, but if nobody else has a more important change request, Lorenzo can do it.\n\n3. **Enabling the multi-lingual features.** Once the translations are ready. I guess @ilaria would \"volunteer\" :grin: to organize the translation process? There's already one translation for the [frontpage in French](/t/10781/2) and it's fine if I get the other translations in a similar manner: as new posts in the respective [Web Content topics](/c/earthos/web-content).

The idea was to welcome everyone to the conversation, but curate it so that it would be truth-oriented and respectful. The years went by, and the community got involved in more projects. More and more people joined in, more ideas were suggested and troubleshot, and all of it stayed on the various iteration of the platform, as a sort of collective memory. \n\nI like to think of online communities like Edgeryders as engines of knowledge and information processing. Questions and data go in, some kind of response comes out that was not obvious by looking at the input. This is functionally not so different from pattern-reading in large masses of data by algorithms (\"artificial intelligence\"). But of course, the differences are there. The three most important ones: \n\n1. **Collective intelligence is powered by humans** instead of machines. It seeks to re-use the rich experience and information of individual humans, combining it in a common effort. \n1. **It aims at sensemaking** instead of computing probabilities. It deals well with open questions: what is important in the present landscape? What should be looking at? And why, what does it mean? How should we react? And so on.\n1. **It accepts as input rich experiential data** rather than big numerical data. As any anthropologist would tell you, there is knowledge to be extracted from human experience, and it is there in ultracompressed form: stories, narratives, case studies and so on.\n\nThe whole process works by facilitating interaction. The Edgeryders forum puts people within line of sight of each other, and tries to increase their interactions with one another. As they interact, they uncover and quesiton assumptions, compare notes, detect patterns and regularities. **Collective intelligence is interactional**, not additive. \n\nWhat do people think? @soenke, is this close to what you mean by \"collective intelligence\"?  \n\nThe beauty of this process is that you can visualize it as a network of interaction. Indeed, this is what I want to do here. \n\nBut first, a few numbers. At the time of writing, the Edgeryders platform has just over 5,000 registered accounts. Of these accounts, 1,524 contributed content, authoring almost 50,000 posts in 8,000 topics, for a total of 6.7 million words, mostly in English (for reference, that's 15 books the size of Tolkien's _The Lord of the Rings_). The unique pairwise interactions \u2013 of the form \"Alice replies to Bob\", where the pair \"Alice and Bob\" is counted as 1 even if Alice replied many times to Bob's content: for simplicity, we can think of them as \"relationships\" \u2013 are over 7,000\n\nAnd here it is: \n![image|690x427](upload://fi3mfitYeO4DOnmzF23RStP90Kc.png)   \n\nThis graph re-uses the platform's categories color scheme (you can can see it in the [home page](https://edgeryders.eu). Red stands for #campfire, orange for #workspaces and so on. The graph's edges take on the color of the category that the exchange their represent took place in. If Alice replied to Bob in the #campfire category, the edge connecting Alice to Bob is drawn in red. As for the nodes, those that are only active in one category also on the color of that category. Those that are active in more than one category are drawn in white. They serve a very important function: connect the different conversations happening around the various projects in Edgeryders, and transport information across them. There are many of them, 458, and this makes this interaction network quite cohesive. Many people could become inactive, and still the different parts of Edgeryders would maintain communication. \n\nBut the individual projects in Edgeryders are themselves quite cohesive. For example, the #ioh project's nodes and edges are not randomly distributed across the graph, but tend to radiate out from its center to its southeast:\n\n![image|690x427](upload://vJizd6rMEJkVGD422iGfxmmeS7C.png) \n\nThe (much larger, for now) #openvillage project lives radiates instead to the south and southwest:\n\n![image|690x427](upload://8haPok6s3EShkiAZgH6BVpXyvPk.png) \n\nMost white nodes, of course, tend to live in the center of the graph. They ensure redundant connectivity between the project. \"Specialist\" blue, green or orange nodes are only participating in one project. They tend to have fewer connections, and the rendering algorithm places them at the periphery of the graph. \n\n**In general, I think we have what looks a fairly balanced collective intelligence engine here**. New project are launched all the time. They maintain their own structural cohesion, and this means you can participate in them without necessarily having to interact with the whole Edgeryders community. At the same time, a large minority of participants in Edgeryders do participate in more than one project. In so doing, they bring to the new ones the memory of the older ones. They can avoid duplication by pointing out to older content that is relevant to the newer context, and to their authors, who can then be invited to join the new project. \n\n**Additionally, the conversation network is quite cohesive**. You could delete the most connected nodes: the result would the disconnection of some peripheral nodes, but the final result would look much like the original graph.", "created_at": "2019-06-10 15:11:00.126636", "updated_at": "2019-06-10 16:25:41.594489", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 877, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 1136.4, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 4096, 8, 5, 4795, 4739, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36860, "user_id": 2095, "topic_id": 7138, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Yes, please send me the link.

Choosing to relate to students who want to learn math, rather than engaging with the shool-is-boring-but-you-can't-leave-so-listen narrative, is also, well, a choice.\n\nAnyway, you have more experience than I do. I am sure there are better teachers around. My (like everybody's) dream math teacher is <a href=\"http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf\">Paul Lockart</a> - present company excluded :-)!

I would certainly encourage teachers to go ahead and have a go, make their own video. Maybe that would morph in low-grade media stardom: we have \"Iron Chef\", why could we not have \"Math Wizards\"? And that would be good, it would create a culture of good teaching, a demand for it, a widespread ability to tell it from not-so-good teaching.

We were not allowed to sit in other teacher's lectures instead of our own, etc. How am I supposed to even know what a good teacher is?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-09 08:44:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:43.645682", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 294, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66050, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11876, "post_number": 4, "raw": "@N1441  just a quick reminder for the Edgeryders [Teaching Teachers Open Source workshop](https://edgeryders.eu/t/teaching-teachers-open-source/9881).\n\n**The workshop takes place tomorrow:**\n\n28:th November - 10:00 - 17:00+\n\nS\u00f6dra Hamnv\u00e4gen 9 (Hus Blivande, [Directions 1](https://goo.gl/maps/euAuAP2LDFBDrvb6A) here)\n\nLunch included (nice and vegetarian)\n\nWould be a perfect fit for you!", "created_at": "2019-11-27 16:58:54.031341", "updated_at": "2019-11-27 16:58:54.031341", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 59, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46812, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8849, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Ok. If you want the bullet points on why we like Mazzucato in this context:\n\n* We turn to SF to paint vivid, believable pictures of completely different economic systems.\n* The notion of \"completely different\" hinges on theories of value that are, themselves, different from the actually prevailing one. For example, in _Walkaway_, _The Dispossessed_ and the Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy authors explore gift economies, sometimes meshing with market economies; in _Distraction_ and _Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom_ it's reputation economies. In neither case does willingness to pay indicate value: these fictional economies are non-marginalist. In _The Value of Everything_, Mazzucato correctly zeroes in on value theory as a fundamental building block not only of economic theory, but also, through theory, of economic _institutions_ like the Standards for National Accounting, and questions it, questioning the whole edifice.\n*  Mazzucato has a unique quality: an almost jolly firmness as she slaughters golden calves with gusto. Neoclassical value theory? Unfounded. GDP? Unfounded _and_ corrupted by lobbying. Patents? a roadblock to innovation. Finance? Extractive, clip its wings. Innovation? Forget market orientation, make it mission oriented. Big Pharma? Inefficient and unethical. VCs? Nowhere to be seen when there is real risk to take on. Government? The real risk-taker, we want more of it and more confident. Apple? Makes cute trinkets, but appropriated publicly funded research for everything really interesting in its products. That makes her the most visionary of today's heavyweight economists. If anyone can tackle SF, she can. \n* She is also starting to sink her teeth in institution design. As a member of the Scottish government's council of economic advisers, she has been highly influential in First Minister's Nicola Sturgeon [National Investment Bank](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/28/scottish-government-to-launch-national-investment-bank). I expect (and hope) her to play an ever growing role in what comes next (EU, I'm looking at you). When thinking at this level of ambition, the thought experiments of SF writers and assorted utopians might help, especially as real life \u2013 Edgeryders included \u2013 has some tiny seeds of actual economic reality that functions according to other paradigms. \n* Blends well with Doctorow:  she an innovation economist, he the editor of _Boing Boing_. Even if they started from opposite corners of value theory (they don't), the common background of having studied the tech sector and VC ecosystem will be a platform for both stand on and meet. \n* Last but not least: I like her personally (we never met, I refer to her public persona). She is kind of a SF character herself \u2013 think a mix of Captain Janeway on _Star Trek_ and, uh, Gandalf? Clear speaker, right combination of empathy and sternness.

Research-wise, the main idea is to run two things:\n\n* A classic ER-style SSNA study on communitarian use of energy and energy tech. \n* Participant observation on three (possibly four) sites where energy communities are forming and launching local initiatives around energy. Presumably, these will be:\n   * one in a very working class neighborhood in Bologna.\n   * one in a \"just transition\" area, probably Poland or eastern Germany.\n   * one in an ecovillage. \n\nThe classic-ER part of the study is going to happen in English and in writing \u2013 no argument there. But the work on the ground in the sites is going to be mostly oral, and in the respective local languages, also no argument. That leaves us with the problem of integrating the two layers. \n\nTo a first approximation, I was thinking of having ethnographers deployed on the ground that are native to the local languages, or as good as, but also fluent in English. They will be the ones to relay (in Engligh) the what happens onsite to the online conversation. Then, the coding happens only in English, though we do allow people to write on the forum in whatever language. We also encourage community members on the ground in the test sites to join the conversation online, but we know most people will not. \n\nCan we do any better than this?

Their work seems to be more of a performative character (doing street actions and theatre plays), while for us the interactive format is the key. Another difference is that we don't have a set crew of actors who perform in our plays. We work with non-actors, and for each play we create a new group of participants who are interested in exploring a certain issue together. Otherwise, yes, our work is similar to the Belarusian colleagues in the sense that we also try to raise awareness about social issues through aesthetic means of theatre.\u00a0\n\nNadia: thanks for the link about Estonian project.

They made a park in a neighborhood's square that had become the center of drug trade. The design and the costruction of the park had based on the partecipation of above all the children, the families and in general of all the neighborhood: it has been an hard work, but the partecipation was so enthusiastic that\u00a0 the inhabitants have organized dinners in the square, have aided in the research of materials and plants. A community seemed re-borned!\n\nHowever passing the time the park is in poor condition and the situation has come back as before the construction of the park.\n\nWhen the designers of Controprogetto had told me this story, they said that the problem is the lack of an education to maintenance.\n\nAnd I thought that not only a physical object requires maintenance and for this reason I'm connecting the two experiences: also a community or commons created and defended by a community need \"maintenance\" of the work done and of the relations created.\n\nyes, is a very complicated issue!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-03 16:31:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:06.509785", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 274, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8898], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24424, "user_id": 131, "topic_id": 6124, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Thanks for your comments. Alberto, I agree that concepts like Folkhemmet can be seen as vague - all cultural identities are and perhaps need to be broad-based enough for everyone to feel ownership of them. That said, it was a turning point in redefining the concept of the family and of society which provided the launchpad &amp; infrastructure for individual solutions over the years introduced by the social institutions. But more importantly, it provided the legitimacy and trust over a new way of living. The same happened with \"fast food\" and look how widespread that's become not just as a way of consuming food but as a way of consuming everything fast. This had a greater impact than the introduction of the first McDonalds restaurant.\n\nIn terms of candidate solutions, think the examples <a href=\"http://bit.ly/VGeN48\">here</a> around bringing together informal and formal groups to work together to start introducing these new ways of making a living.\n\nNoemi, you're right, we always have to define who we mean by we (see what I did there!). Young people living in each country may each feel similarities between their experiences, but these are deeply shaped by the cultural identities which they inhabit. As an English-French binational I experienced this from a very early age, just in terms of the cultural identities that shaped each of my parents and how it played out in how they brought me up and then moving from English school to French university and then Spanish, young people had very different expectations. And these are countries which are neighbours. So as Edegryders collaborating transnationally, it seems\u00a0really important to understand how these cultural identities have shaped our own expectations of how we transition into adulthood and what we can learn from other cultural identities to embed these new ways of living - in this case the Scandinavian or Baltic model.\n\nAnd this works at a local level as Tessy highlights, that informal groups can learn from more established institutionalised organisations and vice versa - that \"systematic &amp; imaginative exposure\" is key. People often focus on the welfare aspect of the Scandinavian model but it's also very decentralised, so perhaps that helps also make social institutions feel closer to people's lives and closer to being exposed to more informal social groups?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-01 08:22:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:15.340177", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 398, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62130, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10974, "post_number": 5, "raw": "thanks you too :)", "created_at": "2019-10-23 16:10:20.174860", "updated_at": "2019-10-23 16:10:20.174860", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [62121], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23216, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5023, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Don't stress, it's all good :)</b>\n\nAnna don't worry, English is fine.

I think we young people today stand to gain the most by a fairer and more sustainable world, and stand to loose the most if the world carries on as it is, depleting resources, polluting the environment, leaving millions in poverty and stripping young people of hope for a better tomorrow. I turn my principles into action every day at the Hub, a global network of centres for social entrepreneurs and innovators who have great ideas for a better world, but not enough resources, connections and support to turn them into reality. Through engaging with a community of passionate individuals within a hosted physical space, I have helped many of these innovators and entrepreneurs achieve their visions. But I want to do more: I want to reach out to more individuals who don't necessarily have a project or idea in mind, but simply want to share a story, seek inspiration, find a friend to help them thorugh a difficult transition. The Internet is the best way to reach out to these individuals when you can't do it in person, like we do at the Hub. Hence my role within EdgeRyders as someone who will help connect ideas, people and passions across Europe and the world. Thanks to my hosting skills developed at The Hub I can be of support to many EdgeRyders who will join our ranks looking for someone inspirational, or for someone willing to work with them to change the world.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-10-21 07:54:05", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 15:10:15.632811", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 380, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54836, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10120, "post_number": 1, "raw": "So, a few weeks ago I was in Ljubljana as one of the approx 80 participants selected to the BIO26 designathon process.\n\nShort background: I used to work for Museum of Architecture and Design in Slovenia in 2013/2014 - right before firmly joining edgeryders - as I was doing my Ph.D. in architecture and politics and found it helpful to immerse myself in the topic. I was soon moved to the Biennale team, where I did communications and some event support. It was the 50th anniversary of the Biennale of Design, and the new curator, Jan Boelen, was shaking things up dramatically: he didn't want pieces of design. He wanted social change, participation, new processes. Which is when the Biennale went a new path, and this is the path I happen to be taking with them once again but from a completely different position. \n\nThis year the process became a competition, where we were first grouped in different topics - University, Library, Garden, Museum, Newspaper, Retirement Home. Then, each of these challenges was tackled by three multidisciplinary groups we were divided into by the curators. We were all handpicked and then hand-distributed, according to our skills and experience. And then we had to compete against each other. \n\nSo, I'm in the retirement group. I am in a team with two young Italian architects and a Chilean visual artist. The only female-only group in the whole competition. \n\nWe're against a duo of Eindhoven trained designers, from Canada and Singapore, who were teamed up with two German architects who run a studio together in Munich and Berlin. The second team was all-Slovenian (strange move), architects and designers, some who already participated in BIO before. \n\nNow, we are given pretty much 30 hours to come up with a project and a compelling pitch and then show them to the jury: Deyan Sudyic, the director of Design Museum in London, Amelie Klein, curator of the Vitra Design Museum in Germany, or Johnny Golding, professor at the Royal College London, among others. \n\nFun! I was absolutely convinced we stand now no chance. And here we are - [we won]( https://bio.si/en/news/1/bio-26-six-projects-commissioned-for-biennial-of-design-announced/), we were commissioned to realise the work for the exhibition in November and we will work with a designer Kathrina Dankl, who mentors our project. \n\nAnd I would like to have Edgeryders play a role in this project. So, what is it about?\n\nRethinking Retirement is an experiential research - we will create two spatial situations, one inside the Retirement home, and one inside the Museum of Architecture (both in  a very interesting neighborhood in Ljubljana, walking distance), connected by visual elements, which will be designed to trigger new responses and ideas about retirement, one of them most probably with an experimental video documenting the research, second - a cozy space filled with participatory events and props. \n\nWe were motivated by several aspects of this challenge:\n\n- a rapidly growing number of elderly people around the globe presents huge potential and resource, and we need to imagine better ways of using these. What we have noticed is that for example all the activities in the retirement home, some of them with beautiful results and demanding craft and skills, are not very smartly done: the results of these stay at the house or are given to the families. What if what and how is produced in the house could be designed better?\n\n- elderly people are extremely humble about their life experience and skills they could offer to the younger generation. They all seemed to feel quite behind, esp in technological development and were more eager to learn from youth than teach them. If asked what could they offer - these would be social and soft skills: empathy, kindness, etc. \n\n- we saw them mostly really happy and fulfilled. But it's a beautiful home for rather privileged people, with a huge waiting list. And we spoke to probably cherry-picked ones anyway. These experiences across the social, economic and age spectrum will be dramatically different. \n\n- dealing with the stigma of aging is key here obviously\n\n- but also: if these retirement homes have so many skills and time, could they offer us a possibility of shifting the economies around them, or maybe even globally? It made me think of [E-nable](http://e-nable.org/), whose founder I saw at Re:Publica this year - he accidentally started a platform of volunteers which provides people with free or cheap, 3d printed prosthetics. We already have space, time and knowledge in one place - and a lot of problems in Slovenia: unemployment, rapid gentrification, frozen and low wages... \n\nWe won't be reshaping the retirement home - we will be inviting people to discuss various scenarios for their retirement.

Consequently, many such assets lie unused; some are beginning to deteriorate. They are extremely varied in nature; many are buildings, gardens, parks. Others are utilities (networks) or even digital assets (data).\n\n**In an effort to correct for this situation, some public assets have been turned over to the private sector.** This move has had mixed results: many privatization programmes have suffered from unintended consequences \u2013 exhibit A being the creation of a powerful oligarch caste in Russia in a very short time. The general consensus seems to be that it might be interesting to explore new avenues.\n\n**Communities have been singled out as candidates for taking care of some public assets, in particular those that can be used to provide services to the community itself.** In at least one European country, the UK, **community owned/managed assets** have become an important policy issue. For example, plans are emerging that could result in up to 500 public libraries being turned over to local communities, together with seed funding, allowing each local community to find a sustainable operation model for its library or see it die. [Locality](http://www.locality.org.uk/), alone, has received over 6,500 enquiries from communities that are keen to acquire, develop and/or manage land and buildings over the past 5 years.\n\n**The Edgeryders community has accumulated significant experience in this area**. Many of us have been experimenting with ways to communally manage diverse assets including: spaces like the unMonastery, digital mesh networks, geographic databases or software projects as public or common goods, oriented towards the community\u2019s well being. There is now evidence available to indicate that communities can indeed provide stewardship, re-using assets, exapting them for new uses, and preserving their functionality and beauty over time. However, issues of fairness arise around any reallocation of right-to-access that are not completely solved, and this makes policy making in this area potentially controversial.\n\n**We hereby convene an international gathering on the theme of transformational community stewardship.** We believe the ability to come together to take care of assets in an unstable context is a key skill for surviving and thriving in the future. The gathering is meant as a locus to exchange information and practical knowledge on how we can put the stock of underutilized public assets to a better use. We are already in deep conversation with many people and groups working on this matter \u2013 from key policy advisors in the UK, to cooperative consultancies in Spain, to hackers and squatters in Poland and intentional communities in Ireland and Greece.\n\n_This post was written collaboratively by: Nadia El-Imam, Alberto Cottica and Arthur Doohan, Edgeryders; Ben Vickers, the unMonastery; Anne-Marie Naylor, Common Futures; Vinay Gupta, UCL Institute for Security and Resilience Studies._\n\n------\n\n##:nl: _Dutch version_ <a name=\"nl\"></a>\n\n## Waarom Stewardship?\n\nDoor de eeuwen heen hebben landen over de hele wereld allerlei soorten bezit ontwikkeld en verworven. De overkoepelende logica achter deze ontwikkelingen heeft, over het algemeen, te maken met het verlenen van openbare diensten. In de afgelopen decennia is er een overbelasting op dit systeem gekomen: landen hebben moeite om de middelen te vinden om deze te kunnen blijven leveren, en hebben zich moeten terugtrekken uit vele nevendiensten. Een bijgevolg is dat veel van dergelijke activa ongebruikt blijven; sommige beginnen zelfs te verslechteren. Je kan denken aan het onderhoud van gebouwen, tuinen, parken. Of netwerken en zelfs digitale assets (data). \n\nIn een poging om dit te corrigeren zijn sommige publieke goederen overgedragen aan de private sector. Deze beweging heeft gemengde resultaten: veel privatiseringsprogramma's hebben last van onbedoelde gevolgen - een goed voorbeeld zijn de oligarchen in Rusland. De algemene consensus lijkt te zijn dat het verkennen van nieuwe wegen wellicht een interessante optie is. \n\nGemeenschappen zelf zijn de uitverkorenen om een aantal van deze openbare activa te ondersteunen en ontwikkelen. Met name diensten die kunnen worden gebruikt door de gemeenschap zelf. Een voorbeeld is Groot Brittanni\u00eb, waar gemeenschap in eigendom / beheerde activa een belangrijk punt is in beleidsplannen. Een project waar momenteel aan gewerkt wordt is het overdragen van ongeveer 500 lokale bibliotheken aan lokale gemeenschappen. Do lokale gemeenschappen moeten dan zelf voor een \u200b\u200bduurzaam model zorgen om de bibliotheek in leven te houden. In de laatste vijf jaar heeft Locality al meer dan 6.500 aanvragen van gemeenschappen gehad die graag gebouwen en terreinen willen verwerven en ontwikkelen. \n\nDe Edgeryders gemeenschap heeft veel ervaring in dit gebied. Velen van ons hebben ge\u00ebxperimenteerd met manieren om diverse activa communaal te beheren: projecten, zoals de unMonastery, digitale mesh netwerken, geografische databases of software projecten als openbare of gemeenschappelijke goederen, gericht op het gemeenschappelijke welzijn. Er is nu bewijs dat deze gemeenschappen inderdaad goed overweg kunnen met het concept rentmeesterschap (stewardship): hergebruik van activa, het opnieuw uitvinden van andere toepassingen, en het behoud van de functionaliteit en schoonheid. Echter, er is een discussie gaande over de de rechtvaardigheid over de herverdeling van right-to-access die niet volledig zijn opgelost, en dit maakt de beleidsvorming op dit gebied controversieel. \n\nWij hebben daarom besloten om internationale conferentie te organiseren rond het thema transformational community stewardship. Wij geloven dat als we samen te komen en zorgen voor de activa in een onstabiele context, dit de manier is om te overleven in de toekomst. De conferentie is bedoeld om informatie en praktische kennis te wisselen over hoe we onderbenutte publieke goederen kunnen gebruiken als gemeenschap. We hebben al met vele mensen en groepen gewerkt rond dit issue - van de belangrijkste beleidsadviseurs in het Verenigd Koninkrijk, tot co\u00f6peratieve adviesbureaus in Spanje, tot hackers en krakers in Polen en leefgemeenschappen in Ierland en Griekenland.\n\n------\n\n## :de: _German version_ <a name=\"de\"></a>\n\n## Gemeinschaftliche Verwaltung: ein dritter Weg\n\n<strong>\u00dcber Jahrhunderte hinweg haben Nationalstaaten in ganz Europa sich die Kontrolle \u00fcber verschiedenste Verm\u00f6genswerte angeeignet oder etabliert.</strong> Die allumfassende Logik hinter dieser Entwicklung und Akquise sollte die Bereitstellung von \u00f6ffentlichen Dienstleistungen sein. \n\n<strong>Jedoch hat dieses Modell in den letzten Jahrzehnten ausgedient</strong>: f\u00fcr die Staaten ist es schwierig geworden, die notwendigen Ressourcen zu finden, um das Verm\u00f6gen weiterhin zu verwalten und damit die Bereitstellung von Serviceleistungen zu gew\u00e4hrleisten. Dadurch mussten sie viele \u00f6ffentliche Dienstleistungen einstellen. In der Konsequenz gibt es einiges an Kapital, das nicht genutzt wird oder beginnt an Wert zu verlieren.\n\n<strong>Um dieser Situation etwas entgegenzusetzen, wurden einige \u00f6ffentliche G\u00fcter dem privaten Sektor \u00fcbergeben</strong>. Dieser Schritt hatte gemischte Resultate: w\u00e4hrend daraus tats\u00e4chlich einige finzanzielle Vorteile f\u00fcr die Staaten entstanden, zumindest kurzfristig, haben viele Privatisierungsprogramme ungewollte Konsequenzen hervorgerufen. Generell scheint es Konsens zu sein, dass es interessant w\u00e4re neue Wege zu beschreiten.\n\n<strong>Als neue Kandidaten wurden Gemeinschaften erw\u00e4hlt</strong>, um sich um einige \u00f6ffentliche G\u00fcter zu k\u00fcmmern, speziell diese, die genutzt werden k\u00f6nnen, um Dienstleistungen f\u00fcr die Gemeinschaft selbst bereitzustellen. Mittlerweile stehen stehen Grundlagen zur Verf\u00fcgung, die belegen, dass Gemeinschaften in der Tat eine verantwortungsvolle Verwaltung gew\u00e4hrleisten k\u00f6nnen. Die Edgeryders Gemeinschaft konnte in diesem Bereich selbst signifikante Erfahrungen sammeln.\n\nWir sind davon \u00fcberzeugt, es eine der wichtigsten F\u00e4higkeiten sein wird, zusammenzukommen und unsere Lebensgrundlagen gemeinsam zu verwalten, um in Zeiten einer ungewissen Zukunft zu \u00fcberleben und zu gedeihen.", "created_at": "2014-04-04 13:22:56", "updated_at": "2018-04-30 08:26:31.562682", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1283, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1438, 207], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57769, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 10214, "post_number": 18, "raw": "> Also boys of the post WWII era were raised to be little princes which made for a lot of men who wanted things to be their way and they never really shifted their patriarchal ways.

In addition to various meat dishes, Georgian cuisine also offers a </em><strong><em>variety of vegetarian meals</em>\u00a0</strong>(and even a lot of VEGAN meals! added myself, not wikipedia). <em>The Georgian cuisine is the result of the rich interplay of culinary ideas carried along the trade routes by merchants and travelers alike. </em>\n\n<em>The importance of both food and drink to Georgian culture is best observed during a feast called <strong>supra</strong>, when a huge assortment of dishes is prepared, always accompanied by large amounts of wine, and that can last for hours. In a Georgian feast, the role of the tamada (toastmaster) is an important and honored position. </em>\n\nSo yes, we will provide you with a traditional Georgian Supra, where you will be able to taste several different delicious dishes this country has to offer.

What I got so far from people I talked to here in Georgia is that procedural knowledge is highly needed 'good': how to do campaigns/engagement/write project proposals/media strategy/etc. But for the people who would be interested in contributing t the making of the book, that's different of course. During the call some said it would perhaps be good to give those a skype call with some of the case study people, but I want to know if we can perhaps identify it rather similarly to makerfox: do a matchmaking as we want to do with the case study people themselves?\n\nI also am really interested in the methodology of Pam's organization.

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS plus ISPConfig 3 as control panel for shared hosting. Host's nothing too powerful, but works with some optimization. (Like, remember to use PHP-FPM on VPSs, as I recently <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/fix-allocate-shared-memory-segment-errors-with-php-fcgi\">found out</a> ...). I have isolated sites against each other (permissions-wise, plus Jailkit), so there's nothing against taking on fairly standard and not-too-heavyweight other sites like Alberto's blog.\n\nYou seem to have other needs though, as you mention getting a dedicated VPS to have own full control without potentially messing up others' sites. I don't see an option to coordinate infrastructure among <em>multiple</em> VPS systems. Except if somebody from the \"Edgespace\" wants to set up their own ethical hosting company and physically host the VPS host system. (That will certainly not be me, as I kind of, em, despise the VPS superstructure as unnecessary complexity for self-hosting. If somebody like Host Europe manages that for me and does it well, I'm ok with VPS from an interface point of view, but if I ever set up servers physically it will always be one machine, one host.)\n\nWhat was your specific idea about coordinating hosting infrastructure around VPS?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-09 01:21:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:42.386265", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 264, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17384], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75018, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13305, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I am already working on 2 webinar initiatives with community members:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/viconnect-play-culture-prototype-webinar-event/13306\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/own-your-cloud-webinar-nextcould-setup-workshop-8th-of-may/13309\n\ncould you help with the outreach?", "created_at": "2020-04-24 16:15:00.218218", "updated_at": "2020-04-24 16:15:00.218218", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 43, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 17.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [74987, 75011], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78761, "user_id": 5667, "topic_id": 13860, "post_number": 3, "raw": "[quote=\"kajafarszky, post:1, topic:13860\"]\n**6)** link on live - https://live.edgeryders.eu/13861\n\nsite: title: Campaign Template template: Campaign theme: Edgeryders lang: en-US menu: anchor: true header: image: https://i.redd.it/x5zojh91awfz.jpg social: ['url', 'twitter', 'facebook', 'linkedin', 'email'] Campaigns Progressive Governance Digital Summit - June 15-19 Link2 Link3{style=\u201cbackground: #EF5D3B; color: white\u201d} Resilient Livelihoods and Behavioural Adaptation to COVID: What can we learn from the strange economy of the Messina district and other case studie\u2026\n[/quote]\n\n @nadia - this one is also up now!", "created_at": "2020-06-11 11:31:04.073923", "updated_at": "2020-06-11 11:31:04.073923", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 89, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 25.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [78757], "is_reply_to": [78757], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76329, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 13475, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-05-11 17:18:07.498362", "updated_at": "2020-05-11 17:18:07.498362", "deleted_at": "2020-05-15 07:15:50.859959", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18322, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1548, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>it's not you, it's us :)</b>\n\nOk yes I was unclear :) Maybe posting a mission report for Help Build the June conference mission summarising your and our reflections and insights areound the commons we have been having in the form of the mission reports and comments\u00a0 we have been posting in the Caring for Commons campaign (See links to what others have posted on the \"Campaigns\" page).

It\u2019s very easy. You just define a suffix for a code, like ( C) for character or (I) for informant, and then introduce an alternative view where you can see the concepts cluster around informant codes, which can be colored differently. This is interesting because it allows you to see at a glance how groups of informants cluster around concepts. This method has the benefit of being very easy to apply and nearly working out of the box, we just had to do a few minor modifications of Graphryder.\n\nAnother way could be to introduce a second \u201cuser\u201d class for informants who are not, themselves, posting on the platform. It could work like this:\n\n1. An ethnographer in the field keeps field notes on pen and paper, transcribing interviews but also conversations between informants in the field, as well as their own observations \n\n2.  When they digitize their notes, they actually assign the transcribed text to Discourse users that they themselves create. This is very easy if they use the form software to create new users. \n\n3. If they are transcribing a conversation between many informants, that becomes a thread. These threads will obviously not be very easy to read, but are rather a structured way to keep notes on a conversation.\n\n4. Technically, they transcribing notes happens in three steps. First, posting all the texts and threads from their own user account. Then creating the \u201cmock\u201d informant user accounts, for example with a certain suffix like _informant. Finally, reassigning all the posts to the right \u201cmock\u201d user account.\n\nAll of the above could be made very easy if we were to devise a script that imported field notes structures in a certain way. For example, treating each new text file as a new topic, and keeping track of who said what through some simple syntax. Field notes could then be imported into Discourse in batch and new informant users created as needed.\n\nWe would then create ways to filter and visualize the graph in Graphryder so that it becomes apparent where the data comes from. For example by:\n* Separating the user graphs of the field informant account user nodes and real user nodes \n* Allowing filtering of the correlation graph to include codes mention by the online conversation, the field conversation, by either or by both.\n\nThis method has the benefit of keeping the social part of the SSNA methodology. We can still keep track of the interactions in conversations. It has the other added benefit that if a field informant later becomes a participant in the online conversation, they can choose to adopt some or all of their transcribed contributions to their own user account.", "created_at": "2020-06-21 09:03:38.202369", "updated_at": "2020-06-21 10:12:57.534722", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 483, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 32.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [79232], "is_reply_to": [79232], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79244, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13884, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Making user accounts was my second thought, yes!

We-- Gabriela A. Sanchez and Dana Mahr from the University of Geneva (https://twitter.com/citizensciences)--want to propose a session where we contextualize socially and historically how civil society has intervened and impacted biomedical knowledge and health care in Western societies. Cases such as the _Women\u2019s Health Movement_ in the 1970s, _the Deaf Culture Movement_, the _Anti-vaccination Movement_, and the _Pro-anorexia Movement_. These explorations helps us understand how social movements can challenge and alter the ways we provide definitions (scientifically and culturally) for things like expertise, health, disease, bodies, and care. The purpose of this reflection is to situate Health Social Movements (HSM) in 2017 and to sketch some of the potentials and pitfalls they face with current social and technological trends like: _Big data driven medicine and care_, the _automatization of health care work_, _scientific citizenship_, the re-emerging _discourse of empowerment and participation_, the _right (or duty) to make individual lifestyle/medical choices_, the growing _medicalization of many aspects of modern life_ and its oppositional (but somehow complementary) trend of _dissenting established medical practices_ (like vaccines and pharmaceuticals). \n\nAgainst the background of these contemporary developments we want to discuss how OpenCare and the themes we discussed during the #openvillage gathering could be positioned in the continuous effort of HSM to alter both, the public discourse about care and its policies. We want to open up the debate with questions like: Why do we believe open science and citizen science are helpful in health care? Is _participation_, _openness_ and _choice_ inherently good? How do we envision shifting dynamics of power between physicians, care-givers, and (informed) patients? Who do they empower?\n\n\n### Format of Session\nWe propose to do a 15 min presentation introducing the session, present basic social concepts and analyze selected examples of HSMs to open a 45 min discussion about possible (un)foreseen failures of contemporary HSMs in creating an inclusive, participatory, individualized, and caring health care movement/infrastructure and develop strategies to properly address them. We believe participants in this session will gain valuable insights into how social movements work by changing the discourse, practice or policies in health care and effect real change. We hope this discussion will also raise new questions and concerns, as well as deep reflexivity of the roles and responsibilities we hold as activists, developers, patients, family caregivers, health-care professionals, policy-makers, etc. \n\n### Thematic hashtags\nhealth social movements :small_blue_diamond: (de)medicalization :small_blue_diamond: normalization of bodies and minds :small_blue_diamond: pseudo-medicine :small_blue_diamond: the ethico-politics of care :small_blue_diamond: othering :small_blue_diamond: intersectionality :small_blue_diamond: partaking vs dissent vs alternatives :small_blue_diamond: illness as a culture :small_blue_diamond: health as a lifestyle", "created_at": "2017-08-17 13:36:25.329427", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 22:45:58.837889", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 474, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 255.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3362, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58453, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10296, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Maybe something for @lorenzoci?", "created_at": "2019-08-27 13:07:09.305624", "updated_at": "2019-08-27 13:07:09.305624", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88269, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14780, "post_number": 16, "raw": "[quote=\"marina, post:15, topic:14780\"]\nWould Tuesday at 10 am work?\n[/quote]\n\nNo. C-KIC session.. unless I delegate @IvanC.", "created_at": "2020-12-04 15:47:58.132531", "updated_at": "2020-12-04 15:47:58.132531", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 11.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [88268], "is_reply_to": [88268], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58557, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10640, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Great choice!\n\nWell done @pwawrzynczyk and @ALaAl!!\nLooking forward to see what your plans are, and what comes out of the community calls next weeks,", "created_at": "2019-08-29 11:10:35.929650", "updated_at": "2019-08-29 11:10:35.929650", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 17.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65346, "user_id": 1514, "topic_id": 9369, "post_number": 33, "raw": "@nadia (Hi!), sorry for the late reply! You remember right. I volunteered as a shepherd helper. Unfortunately, not for long periods. \ud83e\udd20 \ud83d\udc2e \ud83d\udc2e \ud83d\udc2e\n \nWe live in a very abstract society where the consequences of our actions are not immediately visible ([Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau)?). If you work in an \"old-style\" farm, instead, you see the results of your work. Shoveling goat shit is the most rewarding job in the world because at the end of the day you can see a huge heap of shit. The proof that you did well and life is meaningful. \ud83d\udca9 \ud83d\udc10\n \n[Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) said that, in human prehistory, the value of an action depended only on its consequences (pre-moral values). Later religions created some abstract values. People started to act by principles regardless of their consequences. Today technology has replaced religion in this function. Since Over-Men and Over-Women have not come yet, the practice of primitive \"immorality\" is healthy.\n \nI am not sure if I can shed light on the themes of this thread. What I can say about my experience is that living and working in an alpine farm has the same problems as co-housing/co-working. Just harder, I guess. The work is not physically demanding: cows are decent people after all. However, it is a 24/7 job and working conditions, even in the summer, are not always ideal (rain and shit are ok, humidity and children are bad). The main challenge is to live very close to your fellow human beings. There is no space for privacy and you should work hard to make them likeable. I slept under the roof of a rugged cabin together with the fridge where yogurt was stored (we had electricity but no tap water). So my afternoon naps were often interrupted by who was coming for yogurt.\nBut, if the people alchemy works, then you can experience a family-like intimacy, a sense of safety, meaning and home.\n \nUnfortunately, social relations of this kind are disappearing. Traditional herding is not competitive with food market prices. Valleys are abandoned. Population aging, alcoholism, suicides and other social problems are common in marginal areas of the Alps.\n \n\"[The Wind Blows Round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Blows_Round)\" by Giorgio Dritti 2005 is a movie about these topics and the land/place relationship.

Fokus Wachstumswende is a project that offers a civil society platform connecting various civil society organizations and scientific institutions that are looking into alternatives to an economic model that is dependent upon constant growth, and thus the depletion of the environment and the exhaustion of human resources.\u00a0\n\nThe platform is based on a network called \u201cZivile Enquete Wachstum, Wohlstand Lebensqualit\u00e4t\u201d (Civil Enquete Growth, Prosperity, Life Quality) that extends from the Degrowth-Conference 2014 in Leipzig. The network meets on a quarterly basis and includes representatives of a broad variety of civil society organizations and scientific institutions concerned with social or environmental issues. The intention is to raise awareness on post-growth-ideas, to facilitate an exchange between different levels and fields, and to create potential synergies. For instance, NGOs often lack a scientific or theoretical backbone for their work, while theoreticians often miss the benefit of practical experience. The sciences in turn lack the ability to communicate their findings to the public at large. The network also works with political foundations and unions, yet the work transcends party lines. Together they generate concrete suggestions for policies that look toward the notion of a post-growth society and they work on storytelling to communicate these proposals to a broader public.\u00a0\n\nOn a superficial level, it may seem like the degrowth movement is all about economics and has little to do with care. Yet the vicious circle of increasing production and consumption that we call economic growth is quite clearly making a lot of people unhappy and sick. Beyond certain thresholds, more growth does not necessarily equal a better quality of life. Eliminating the external and internal pressures for senseless growth would allow us to reconsider human potential. Reducing working hours for example can lead to more time for exchange and support between people and new concepts for more societal participation. A post-growth economy is based on sustainable activity within planetary boundaries and a more healthy future!\n\nhttps://wachstumswende.de/project/fokus-wachstumswende/\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-30 14:42:07", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 14:11:44.471732", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 367, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29671, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6244, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Hm</b>\n\nRising costs: that's in your own draft , I am just proposing an aggregation mode. \u263a EDIT: sorry, I was wrong.

About 15 people participated in the meeting: among them, @matthias, @irene_1, @jean_russell, @fjanss, @teunvansambeek, @JasonCole, @Stef-Kuypers, @Jorge and others who, I think, are not (yet?) registered on the platform. Here's what went on:\n\n## Round on introductions\n\nWe had one! \n\n## Overview of 2020\n\nWe then went over what we think 2020 looks like for the Lab. Things are still in flux, but we hope to do three things:\n\n1. Produce papers, to be published somehow (a book? a journal?). The process of writing them could be punctuated by online seminars, where co-authors present their initial results. \n1. Co-curate with Climate-KIC a policy-oriented event, to take place in late 2020.\n1. Turn the Lab into a community, which anyone interested can join without permission. The community would live mostly here, on edgeryders.eu (for now. If need be, it is easy to move it from here to a dedicated federated site under communities.edgeryders.eu). I am personally committed to make a special effort to include in the community the doers: people who are experimenting in practice with different economic systems. This includes ecovillages, some intentional communities, local currencies champions, post-capitalist enterprises (right, @gyrgir, @lasindias?) and so on. \n\n## Mapping \"hot topics\" for the Lab\n\nWe spend most of the session discussing hot topics, defined as what people are actually working on. I started by attempting a very rough grouping on the basis of the replies I had received to the [Call for co-authors](https://scifieconomicslab.net/#call); but there were several people in the room who had not responded to the call and, conversely, several people who had responded were not in the room. So Jean and others coordinated an effort to do that, in order to map possible collaborations. The results was the following list: \n\n* Data economics\n* Disruption of money\n* Moneyless economies\n* Computer modeling (either aggregated, like in classical economics \u2013 @mstn has produced a \"pre-paper\" in that vein \u2013 or agent-based)\n* Models for organizations and corporate governance\n* Fictional economies: \"what would happen if...\" questions\n* The natural world as an economic actor\n\nThe exercise also mapped individual interests *in the room* (as people not in the room were not there to speak for themseleves) to these topics. The result was the following graph: \n\n![image|690x506](upload://8WWuJGvS1DUDGm8bYHGRc7dapXY.png)\n\n## Output format and the role of science fiction\n\nWe are not yet sure what format the Lab's output will take. At least two are possible:\n\n1. Economics papers, drawing on questions that sci-fi novels are good at raising\n1. Sci-fi works (short stories or novels) with a strong economics backbone, like *Walkaway*. \n\nWe could even edit an anthology of papers + stories. Ideas and feedback welcome. \n## What next? \n\n* The call for co-authors stays open.\n* People are invited to make themselves findable, by posting on the Lab's space here on Edgeryders. Some people have posted about their work (like @karl [here](/t/11400/4)). Others have introduced themselves on the [dedicated thread](/t/11480).\n* People are encouraged to get in touch with each other to propose collaborations ([example](/t/11504)).", "created_at": "2019-11-14 11:19:11.492821", "updated_at": "2019-11-14 17:16:56.381785", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 545, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 1605.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 1543], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34108, "user_id": 3374, "topic_id": 6660, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Description:** A panel on different models for how to build mental health care into the structures of communities, such as universities, cohousing projects, and neighborhoods. I see this session operating in two possible ways. \n\nThe first way is for several people who have worked on creating support systems to introduce their communities, as well as what frameworks they have used. When discussing their frameworks, they should talk about advantages/disadvantages, the process involved in implementing these plans and how they have adapted them to their communities. Followed by an audience Q&A.\n\nIf other possible participants haven\u2019t used any framework or plan and instead worked addressing their community needs as they noticed the need (which is not uncommon in many communities), the other option would be for all of us to introduce our communities. And then I would discuss the JED Foundation\u2019s Framework for Success and how we adapted it to Minerva (my university). From there we could discuss how this framework could be used and tailored to each community represented on the panel. Followed by an audience Q&A.\n\n**Takeaways:** One or more frameworks for developing the mental health care of your community. And advice on strengths and pitfalls of each from people who have used them.\n\n**Needs:** Additional Panel Participants willing to share their experiences. A better understanding of the scope of the Creating Situations for Healthy Experiences session to make sure they are strong complements and don\u2019t overlap.\n\n**My Background:** I\u2019ve worked in my university\u2019s Mental Health Team as an intern for almost two years. In that time I got to help in developing our support system plans in three countries. \n\n**Who Might be Interested in this Session:** Those working and living in communities of care, other universities, and people in the mental health field.

W restauracji pracowa\u0142em od 6:00 do 12:00, potem szybko ogarnia\u0142em ksi\u0119gowo\u015b\u0107, po czym wymieniali\u015bmy si\u0119 z \u017con\u0105 przy synu. W organizacjach ca\u0142y czas jestem zatrudniony na umowach zlecenia. Nie mia\u0142o to dla mnie znaczenia. Skadki na ubezpieczenie emerytalne mam p\u0142acone. Nie mam sta\u017cu pracy. Musia\u0142bym doci\u0105gn\u0105\u0107 do 65 lat, \u017ceby dosta\u0107 emerytur\u0119. Od zlecenia i tak mam p\u0142acone pe\u0142ne sk\u0142adki, wi\u0119c m\u00f3j kapita\u0142 ca\u0142y czas ro\u015bnie. W niekt\u00f3rych miesi\u0105cach mam 1 500 z\u0142 brutto przez p\u00f3\u0142 roku, potem przez miesi\u0105c - dwa mam mniej, ale p\u00f3\u017aniej przez kolejne p\u00f3\u0142 roku mam 2 000 z\u0142 brutto. Raz jest mniej, raz jest wi\u0119cej. Mo\u017cliwe, \u017ce nazbiera\u0142oby si\u0119 na zasi\u0142ek dla bezrobotnych w razie konieczno\u015bci rejestracji w urz\u0119dzie pracy. \n\nMam 39 lat. Nie mam takiego poczucia, \u017ce funkcjonuj\u0119 niestabilnie. Moje potrzeby dostosowuj\u0119 do moich zasob\u00f3w. Staram si\u0119 nie \u017cy\u0107 ponad stan. Co prawda nie mam za bardzo oszcz\u0119dno\u015bci, bo pomagam mojemu starszemu bratu finansowo. Gdybym nie musia\u0142 mu pomaga\u0107, by\u0142bym w stanie nawet jakie\u015b oszcz\u0119dno\u015bci wygenerowa\u0107. \n\nPierwszy kredyt - na 25 000 z\u0142 - zaci\u0105gn\u0119li\u015bmy prawie po roku na doposa\u017cenie restauracji. Na start \u017cona dosta\u0142a 40 000 z\u0142 dofinansowania i to nam wystarczy\u0142o. To by\u0142a dotacja z projektu unijnego na aktywizacj\u0119 kobiet wchodz\u0105cych na rynek pracy. Plus by\u0142a mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 rozliczenia dotacji kwotami brutto i mieli\u015bmy jeszcze prawo odliczy\u0107 VAT, czyli ten VAT do nas wr\u00f3ci\u0142. Tyle tylko, \u017ce  kasa ze zwrotu VAT musia\u0142a by\u0107 przeznaczona na dalszy rozw\u00f3j firmy. I tak by\u0142o. Od samego pocz\u0105tku zatrudniali\u015bmy 2 osoby, a w szczycie nawet 4 osoby na pe\u0142ny etat, plus nas dwoje i 2-3 osoby na u\u0142amek etatu, tj.: przychodzi\u0142y po 3-4 godziny dziennie. By\u0142y miesi\u0105ce, gdzie mieli\u015bmy plecy i miesi\u0105ce, w kt\u00f3rych by\u0142a g\u00f3rka finansowa. W sumie to si\u0119 jako\u015b bilansowa\u0142o. Prowadzili\u015bmy biznes do grudnia 2018 r. Ca\u0142y czas by\u0142em zaanga\u017cowany przez 4-5 godz. dziennie, czasami mniej, czasami wi\u0119cej. Sprzedali\u015bmy restauracj\u0119, bo trafi\u0142 si\u0119 bardzo dobry kupiec, kt\u00f3ry da\u0142 nam cen\u0119 powy\u017cej warto\u015bci rynkowej. Druga taka oferta mog\u0142aby si\u0119 nie trafi\u0107. Szczeg\u00f3lnie, \u017ce wiedzieli\u015bmy, \u017ce b\u0119dziemy si\u0119 anga\u017cowa\u0107 w sp\u00f3\u0142dzielni\u0119. Prowadzenie dw\u00f3ch biznes\u00f3w naraz by\u0142oby troch\u0119 trudne. W po\u0142owie 2018 r zaci\u0105gn\u0119li\u015bmy kredyt na kupno dzia\u0142ki z domem. Kasa ze sprzeda\u017cy restauracji posz\u0142a na sp\u0142at\u0119 tego kredytu. Jeszcze go sp\u0142acamy. Nie wiem dok\u0142adnie ile. Trzeba by \u017cony spyta\u0107. \u017bona sp\u0142aca kredyt, a ja utrzymuj\u0119 dom. P\u0142ac\u0119 za rachunki, za wynajem mieszkania. Miesi\u0119cznie mamy ok. 1 000 \u2013 1 100 z\u0142 koszt\u00f3w sta\u0142ych, bo bardzo ma\u0142o p\u0142acimy za wynajem. Czyli z ca\u0142ego mojego wynagrodzenia utrzymuj\u0119 rodzin\u0119. Wynaj\u0119li\u015bmy mieszkanie w maju 2012 r. i wtedy kosztowa\u0142o 600 z\u0142 plus drobne op\u0142aty. By\u0142o prawie do generalnego remontu. Od tego czasu nie podniesiono nam czynszu. Wzrastaj\u0105 tylko op\u0142aty niezale\u017cne od wynajmuj\u0105cego: woda, gaz. Mieszkanie jest w \u015bcis\u0142ym centrum. Mamy ogrzewanie gazowe. \n\nNie mam za bardzo por\u00f3wnania, ale uwa\u017cam, \u017ce wszystkie moje obowi\u0105zki nie wp\u0142ywaj\u0105 za bardzo na wychowanie dziecka. Szczeg\u00f3lnie, \u017ce pracujemy razem z \u017con\u0105. To nie jest taki model jak w innych rodzinach, \u017ce ojca nie ma ca\u0142y dzie\u0144 w domu, bo musi pracowa\u0107; \u017ce widujemy si\u0119 tylko wieczorem i czasami w weekendy. My sp\u0119dzamy ze sob\u0105 du\u017co czasu. Syn jest cz\u0119sto z nami w pracy. Co prawda ogl\u0105da co\u015b w telefonie albo bawi si\u0119 gierkami, ale jestem przy nim fizycznie. Mo\u017ce w ka\u017cdym momencie przyj\u015b\u0107, przytuli\u0107 si\u0119, pogada\u0107. To s\u0105 troch\u0119 plusy i troch\u0119 minusy, bo czasami musz\u0119 si\u0119 zaj\u0105\u0107 innymi rzeczami. Zazwyczaj weekendy sp\u0119dzamy razem. Od czasu do czasu pomagaj\u0105 nam dziadkowie: albo jedni albo drudzy. Nie ma z tym problemu. Mam ten komfort, \u017ce zawsze mog\u0119 liczy\u0107 na rodzic\u00f3w. \n\nSyn od wrze\u015bnia idzie do zer\u00f3wki, ale w systemie Montessori to jest pierwsza klasa. To jest tak zrobione, \u017ceby pasowa\u0142o do reformy szkolnictwa. W Montessori dzieciaki zaczynaj\u0105 edukacj\u0119 szkoln\u0105 w wieku 6 lat, ale nie mog\u0105 tego nazwa\u0107 pierwsz\u0105 klas\u0105, bo wtedy dzieciaki musia\u0142yby mie\u0107 specjaln\u0105 opini\u0119 od psychologa, \u017ce mog\u0105 ju\u017c i\u015b\u0107 do szko\u0142y. Oficjalnie to jest oddzia\u0142 przedszkolny zerowy, ale programowo zaczynaj\u0105 ju\u017c edukacj\u0119 szkoln\u0105. Nie by\u0142o problemu z przedszkolem. Na pocz\u0105tku zapisali\u015bmy syna do zwyk\u0142ego oddzia\u0142u, a potem okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce mog\u0105 go przenie\u015b\u0107 do oddzia\u0142u Montessori - w ramach tego samego przedszkola. Wiedzia\u0142em co to jest za system. Poza tym c\u00f3rka mojego przyjaciela chodzi tam i on poleca\u0142. W du\u017cym skr\u00f3cie: w tym systemie nauczyciel zwraca du\u017c\u0105 uwag\u0119 na predyspozycje dziecka i stara si\u0119 go rozwija\u0107 w tym kierunku. Syn b\u0119dzie chodzi\u0142 do publicznej szko\u0142y w systemie Montessori. S\u0105 dwie publiczne szko\u0142y Montessori w Polsce: w O. i w Krakowie. Obawiam si\u0119, \u017ce nie by\u0142oby nas sta\u0107 na czesne w prywatnej szkole. Syn dosta\u0142 si\u0119 bez \u017cadnego problemu, wi\u0119c musia\u0142 mie\u0107 bardzo dobr\u0105 opini\u0119 z przedszkola, do kt\u00f3rego chodzi teraz. W tym systemie edukacja szkolna trwa 9 lat, razem z zer\u00f3wk\u0105. Nie mamy w zwi\u0105zku z tym dodatkowych koszt\u00f3w, wi\u0119kszych ni\u017c w tradycyjnej publicznej szkole.  \n\nKorzysta\u0142em z podstawowej opieki zdrowotnej. Dwa razy mia\u0142em powa\u017cniejszy zabieg - zawsze publicznie. Nigdy zbyt d\u0142ugo nie oczekiwa\u0142em na wizyt\u0119. By\u0142em przyj\u0119ty z dnia na dzie\u0144 do specjalisty. Badania te\u017c raczej robili mi od r\u0119ki. Dwukrotnie syn by\u0142 w szpitalu i te\u017c opieka by\u0142a na ca\u0142kiem niez\u0142ym poziomie. Trzeba by\u0142o si\u0119 przespa\u0107 na bardzo niewygodnym krzese\u0142ku na sali, ale nie robili problem\u00f3w, \u017ceby rodzic zosta\u0142 z dzieckiem na ca\u0142y dzie\u0144. Chcia\u0142bym, \u017ceby lekarze zarabiali wi\u0119cej. Wtedy lekarze nie musieliby dorabia\u0107 prywatnie i w innych klinikach To wymusza bieda zarobk\u00f3w pa\u0144stwowych. M\u00f3j brat stryjeczny jest lekarzem ginekologiem - syna widzi w sobot\u0119 i w niedziel\u0119, bo ca\u0142y tydzie\u0144 pracuje poza miejscem zamieszkania. Raz skorzysta\u0142em z prywatnej opieki zdrowotnej, z inicjatywy matki, lata temu, bo um\u00f3wi\u0142a wizyt\u0119 dla brata, ale on nie m\u00f3g\u0142 by\u0107, wi\u0119c ja poszed\u0142em na jego miejsce.\n\nBy\u0142em zarejestrowany w urz\u0119dzie pracy, bo chcia\u0142em dosta\u0107 sta\u017c finansowany przez urz\u0105d chwil\u0119 po uko\u0144czeniu studi\u00f3w, \u017ceby pracowa\u0107 w organizacji. Dosta\u0142em 1 000 z\u0142 na dziecko i potem przez rok mia\u0142em dodatek piel\u0119gnacyjny w wysoko\u015bci ok. 100 z\u0142 miesi\u0119cznie. Od lipca b\u0119dziemy dostawa\u0107 500 plus na syna. Nie wp\u0142ywa to na nasz bud\u017cet tak bardzo. Chc\u0119 te pieni\u0105dze odk\u0142ada\u0107 na subkoncie i przeznaczy\u0107 je na potrzeby i dalszy rozw\u00f3j syna. W tym momencie nie by\u0142bym w stanie za\u0142o\u017cy\u0107 takiego funduszu w podobnej wysoko\u015bci, tylko na poziomie ok. 150-200 z\u0142. \n\nJestem agnostykiem, czyli de facto mam to w dupie. Tak jak powiedzia\u0142 Bertrand Russell: jak teista m\u00f3wi \u201eB\u00f3g jest\u201d, ateista: \u201eBoga nie ma\u201d, tak agnostyk m\u00f3wi: \u201eA ja mam to w dupie\u201d. Nie dokona\u0142em apostazji. Nie jest mi to potrzebne, nie jest dla mnie istotne. Rodzice starali si\u0119 mnie  wychowa\u0107 w duchu katolicyzmu, a matka nadal pr\u00f3buje. Pogl\u0105dy takie naby\u0142em w wieku 15 lat i jestem im wierny. Uwa\u017cam siebie za radykalnego demokrat\u0119 i anarchist\u0119. W wieku 15 lat fascynowa\u0142em si\u0119 histori\u0105 XIX i XX wieku. Moi koledzy szli w kierunku nacjonalizmu, a mnie jara\u0142y idee wolno\u015bciowe. Potem dosz\u0142a muzyka, kontrkultura punkowa i tak si\u0119 potoczy\u0142o. Na szereg kwestii mam zupe\u0142nie inny pogl\u0105d ni\u017c wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa. Jestem osob\u0105 bardziej otwart\u0105 i tolerancyjn\u0105. Wa\u017cniejsze s\u0105 dla mnie sprawy socjalne, mi\u0119dzyludzkie, dobrobyt spo\u0142eczny ni\u017c w\u0142asne bogacenie si\u0119. Du\u017co rzeczy mnie irytuje. Szczeg\u00f3lnie w dzisiejszych czasach irytuje mnie dominuj\u0105ca rola ko\u015bcio\u0142a katolickiego w Polsce; \u017ce ich narracja jest narzucana, ich warto\u015bci. Denerwuje mnie pozorny wzrost si\u0142 skrajnie prawicowych, chocia\u017c uwa\u017cam to za problem du\u017co nadmuchany w Polsce. W rzeczywisto\u015bci te \u015brodowiska s\u0105 mniej liczne i mniej oddzia\u0142uj\u0105ce ni\u017c chce si\u0119 je przedstawia\u0107. Media g\u0142\u00f3wnego nurtu i \u015brodowiska liberalne strasz\u0105 ONR (przyp.: Ob\u00f3z Narodowo - Radykalny) i M\u0142odzie\u017c\u0105 Wszechpolsk\u0105, gdzie aktywnych cz\u0142onk\u00f3w jest mniej ni\u017c 10 000. W spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwie, gdzie \u017cyje nas 35 mln to promil promila. Te \u015brodowiska maj\u0105 wsparcie w \u015brodowiskach kibicowskich, ale te s\u0105 bardzo labilne i powierzchowne. Dzisiaj popieraj\u0105 prawic\u0119, ale za 2-3 lata stadiony b\u0119d\u0105 mocno lewicowe. Nie jest tak, \u017ce kibice s\u0105 zawsze po prawej stronie, a nie po lewej. Kibice Polonii Warszawa i St. Pauli te\u017c s\u0105 w Polsce obecni. Jest kupa ludzi chodz\u0105cych regularnie na mecze, ale maj\u0105cych pogl\u0105dy lewicowe. Ci najbardziej skrajni s\u0105 najbradziej g\u0142o\u015bni i g\u0142\u00f3wnie ich wida\u0107. Jest ich garstka, ale \u017ce to oni kr\u0119c\u0105 oprawami meczu, przyjmuje si\u0119, \u017ce to pogl\u0105d ca\u0142ego stadionu, co nie jest prawd\u0105. Nie mo\u017cna powiedzie\u0107, \u017ce przez grupk\u0119 10-15 kiboli powi\u0105zanych z neofaszystami, wszyscy kibole s\u0105 neonazistami. Na przyk\u0142adzie kibic\u00f3w Lecha Pozna\u0144: oni w\u0142\u0105czyli si\u0119 bardzo przeciw ACTA, a w Poznaniu to wszystko kr\u0119ci\u0142o \u015brodowisko zwi\u0105zane z ultralewackim Rozbratem. Jest silna narracja \u017ale poj\u0119tego patriotyzmu, ale nie widz\u0119 w tym mocnego zagro\u017cenia, \u017ce nagle odrodzi si\u0119 w Polsce ruch faszystowski czy nazistowski. Oczywi\u015bcie wychodz\u0119 z za\u0142o\u017cenia, \u017ce je\u015bli w Polsce jest jeden faszysta, to jest o tego jednego za du\u017co. Niestety zawsze b\u0119d\u0105 ludzie, kt\u00f3rych b\u0119d\u0105 poci\u0105ga\u0142y te idee, tak samo jak innych b\u0119d\u0105 poci\u0105ga\u0142y idee wolno\u015bciowe czy anarchistyczne.\n\nAnarchizm to dla mnie jak najmniej wsp\u00f3\u0142pracy z pa\u0144stwem i jak najwi\u0119cej tworzenia ruch\u00f3w oddolnych, wywalczanie sobie jak najwi\u0119cej w\u0142asnej przestrzeni; przez dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 pozarz\u0105dow\u0105 mocno niehierarchiczn\u0105, nieustrukturyzowan\u0105, jak food not bombs czy tworzenie niezale\u017cnych przestrzeni, gdzie mo\u017ce toczy\u0107 si\u0119 \u017cycie spo\u0142eczne, jak Rozbrat w Poznaniu lub Tektura w Lublinie. Wiem, \u017ce to totalna utopia, \u017ce obalimy kiedy\u015b pa\u0144stwo, ale chodzi o to, \u017ceby wywalczy\u0107 sobie jak najwi\u0119cej przestrzeni do dzia\u0142a\u0144. \u015arodowiska wolno\u015bciowe robi\u0105 dobr\u0105 robot\u0119 w dzia\u0142alno\u015bci spo\u0142eczno \u2013 politycznej, czyli jakie\u015b akcje lokatorskie, pomocowe, np.: wspieranie w walce o lepsze warunki pracy, tworzenie zwi\u0105zk\u00f3w zawodowych, spo\u0142ecznych przedsi\u0119biorstw, kt\u00f3re pr\u00f3buj\u0105 zawalczy\u0107 o miejsce na wolnym rynku. Nie g\u0142osuj\u0119 w wyborach, ale w nast\u0119pnych prawdopodobnie si\u0119 z\u0142ami\u0119 i zag\u0142osuj\u0119. Chcia\u0142bym, \u017ceby by\u0142 z\u0142amany duopol w\u0142adzy PO-PIS i zamierzam g\u0142osowa\u0107 na Parti\u0119 Razem, czyli lewicow\u0105. W niekt\u00f3rych rzeczach jest mi blisko do nich, w niekt\u00f3rych nie. Mimo to uwa\u017cam, \u017ce warto na nich g\u0142osowa\u0107. W dziedzinie pomocy spo\u0142ecznej, socjalnej, podej\u015bcia ekologicznego i do sytuacji mi\u0119dzynarodowej jest mi bliski. Chodzi o nurt pacyfistyczny \u2013 ograniczenie finansowania misji zagranicznych polskiego wojska, np.: Irak, Afganistan, gdzie nie by\u0142o nam to potrzebne. Nie jest tak, \u017ce jedna partia jest tylko dobra albo tylko z\u0142a. Niekt\u00f3re pomys\u0142y PIS s\u0105 dobre i warte kontynuowania, np.: 500 plus. To jest jedyny dobry program spo\u0142eczny, reszta program\u00f3w niby prospo\u0142ecznych to faktycznie buble albo nie s\u0105 w og\u00f3le realizowane. Program Mieszkanie plus to paradoks, gdzie za brak op\u0142aty czynszowej mo\u017cna by\u0107 od razu wyrzuconym z mieszkania. W przypadku 500 plus wprowadzi\u0142bym na pewno kryterium dochodowe. Nie na wydumanym poziomie 800 z\u0142 \u2013 1 000 z\u0142, tylko osoby z dochodem powy\u017cej 2 000 \u2013 2 500 z\u0142 nie dostawa\u0142yby 500 plus. Zupe\u0142nie nie umiem si\u0119 ustawi\u0107 na dychotomii lewica- prawica, bo ona odesz\u0142a do lamusa i nijak si\u0119 nie da. Wszystkie internetowe kompasy polityczne pisz\u0105, \u017ce by\u0142bym idealnym wyborc\u0105 korwinist\u00f3w, narodowc\u00f3w i innych, np.: jestem za obni\u017ceniem podatku dochodowego i podatk\u00f3w od prowadzenia ma\u0142ych dzia\u0142alno\u015bci, za totalnym uproszczeniem, \u017ceby nie tworzy\u0107 biurokracji, ale te\u017c jestem za utworzeniem kilku prog\u00f3w podatkowych: 10, 18, 32, 40, \u017ceby wszyscy si\u0119 dok\u0142adali w miar\u0119 swoich mo\u017cliwo\u015bci. Dla niekt\u00f3rych 18% to jest bardzo du\u017co podatku, a dla innych 32% to bardzo ma\u0142o.\n\nWiosna nie jest parti\u0105 lewicow\u0105, tylko liberaln\u0105. Aksjologicznie jest lewicowa, ale gospodarczo jest mocno liberalna. SLD ci\u0119\u017cko nazwa\u0107 parti\u0105 lewicow\u0105. Oni s\u0105 lewic\u0105 tylko z nazwy. G\u0142\u00f3wnym punktem programowym Wiosny jest walka o prawa os\u00f3b LGBT. To wa\u017cne, ale nie najwa\u017cniejsze. Polska potrzebuje rozwi\u0105zania innych problem\u00f3w, trzeba ustali\u0107 hierarchi\u0119 warto\u015bci. Dla mnie wa\u017cniejsza jest walka z wykluczeniem spo\u0142ecznym, szczeg\u00f3lnie ludzi na wschodzie Polski. PIS dobrze odczyta\u0142o czego ludzie potrzebuj\u0105 w pasie wschodnim, dlatego utrzymuje si\u0119 tam tak wysokie poparcie. 500 plus du\u017co da\u0142o, teraz PIS zapowiada, \u017ce b\u0119dzie stara\u0142o si\u0119 walczy\u0107 z wykluczeniem komunikacyjnym. Szczeg\u00f3lnie na wschodzie wida\u0107, \u017ce to dla ludzi du\u017cy problem. Nie maj\u0105 jak dojecha\u0107 do wi\u0119kszego miasta oddalonego o 10-15 km, nie posiadaj\u0105c w\u0142asnego samochodu. Miasteczka takie jak W\u0142odawa czy \u0141a\u0144cut wyludniaj\u0105 si\u0119 i zostaj\u0105 sami starzy ludzie, bo te miasteczka s\u0105 dla m\u0142odych ludzi zupe\u0142nie nieatrakcyjne.\n\nNajwi\u0119kszym problemem w Polsce s\u0105 problemy ekologiczne i ochrony przyrody. Rz\u0105d w \u017caden spos\u00f3b nie stara si\u0119 walczy\u0107 z problemem globalnego ocieplenia, kt\u00f3ry dotyka nas coraz mocniej i wymaga radykalnych zmian globalnie. Nie ma cho\u0107by lokalnych program\u00f3w walki ze smogiem, kt\u00f3ry dusi ka\u017cde miasto w Polsce. Te problemy s\u0105 zupe\u0142nie pomijane, tylko gdzie\u015b tam na samym ko\u0144cu si\u0119 o nich wspomina. Chodzi o realne programy, a nie wydumane jak Wiosny, \u017ce do 2030 roku zamkniemy wszystkie kopalnie i elektrownie w\u0119glowe. To jest jaka\u015b fantazja.\n\nProblemy spo\u0142eczne s\u0105 marginalizowane. S\u0105 pokazywane jako hamulcowy rozwoju Polski, tak jak ekologia. Rozw\u00f3j miasta to jak najwi\u0119ksza ilo\u015b\u0107 blok\u00f3w, zalewanie betonem i walka z zieleni\u0105, tworzenie nowych miejsc parkingowych i szerszych ulic, ale to w praktyce zwijanie miasta. Jak na przyk\u0142adzie Lublina, racje ludzi z pieni\u0119dzmi s\u0105 wa\u017cniejsze ni\u017c tych, kt\u00f3rzy chc\u0105, \u017ceby to miasto nadawa\u0142o si\u0119 do \u017cycia, \u017ceby nas nie dusi\u0142 smog, \u017ceby transport by\u0142 w du\u017cej mierze publiczny, a nie oparty na prywatnym samochodzie, \u017ceby miasto by\u0142o zielone, w miar\u0119 czyste, i \u017ceby by\u0142o w miar\u0119 zdrowe powietrze. Ludzie w Polsce nie rozumiej\u0105 pewnych problem\u00f3w. Ca\u0142y czas globalne ocieplenie jest przedstawiane jako wymys\u0142 grupy naukowc\u00f3w, nie do ko\u0144ca potwierdzony i prawdziwy. Czy to dotyczy Polski? Fajnie, \u017ce b\u0119dzie globalne ocieplenie, bo b\u0119dzie gor\u0105ce lato. Jak kiedy\u015b si\u0119 wypowiedzia\u0142 Roman Giertych, \u017ce on jest za globalnym ociepleniem, bo w Polsce b\u0119d\u0105 ros\u0142y cytryny. Ludzie nie zdaj\u0105 sobie sprawy, \u017ce kryzys migracyjny te\u017c jest poniek\u0105d spowodowany globalnym ociepleniem. Tereny w Afryce coraz bardziej pustynniej\u0105. Ludziom brakuje \u015brodk\u00f3w, \u017ceby tam \u017cy\u0107 i ci\u0105gn\u0105 do zachodniej Europy. Ludzie cz\u0119sto nie widz\u0105 pewnych powi\u0105za\u0144. Ale te\u017c nikt nie stara si\u0119 w prosty, przejrzysty spos\u00f3b im tego wyt\u0142umaczy\u0107: \u017ce to co robimy w Polsce, ma wp\u0142yw globalny.", "created_at": "2019-08-09 16:25:55.125044", "updated_at": "2019-08-09 16:25:55.125044", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2436, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75019, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 13140, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Thanks @federico_monaco - I'll push some updates over the next week, and will ping you then.", "created_at": "2020-04-24 16:23:20.712331", "updated_at": "2020-04-24 16:23:20.712331", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 22.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [75016], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66442, "user_id": 6033, "topic_id": 12034, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Ask the person who is speaking right now what their name is, and if they already have an edgeryders.eu account?

Long story short: we aren't ideal candidate if we create a more classical bit on the contest. So for a long time i was searching that edge for Brussels which could give it something interesting to run against smaller but more fit (based on winning bit books from the past 10 years) cities like Charleroi, Leuven or Ghent. \n\nOne of the interesting reveals from the preparation dossier was that the cultural field (from high end culture till the socio-cultural organisation) want more implication by/with the whole buttom up / emerging Brussel centered field mixing culture / urbanism / social implications... The other reveal was the fact they rather want a 10 year route towards a collective goal, then a 1 year event year where lots of money is pumped. Quite logical if you want to create a sustainable cultural field. \n\nA couple of weeks ago i took part in the [Saint-Vide-Leegbeek](https://www.facebook.com/saintvideleegbeek/) announcement, or the day that was announced there was a 20th commune in the city regrouping all the empty space and asking for a more humaine policy. \nInteresting evening regrouping people from CLTB, Toestand, 123, Communa,... (and also in the line of tought of our [Cultural Squad event](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-makes-a-sustainable-work-space-for-collectives-in-brussels-see-you-on-1-may/9771)\n\nWhile sitting at the bar last week, talking about Brussels future with a friend, two puzzle pieces clicked. The edge i was looking for BRXL2030 was the absurdity to announce the candidacy as the 20th commune and start a bit from empty spaces and their challenge / opportunity for the city. From their lots of things started to click with the dossier i'm attaching here <a class=\"attachment\" href=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2ae31861f8f5b8adb88af00343dfa0c29988557c.pdf\">Rapport de consultation BRXL 2030.pdf</a> (2.9 MB)\n \nWhile i was having this idea, life goes through strange turns, because i got a message from my old collegues at [RABBKO](https://rabbko.be/en/) (who worked with me on BRXL2030) to debrief tonight about what lays ahead after a standstill due elections and politics. I think i'm going to pitch this idea and see how it rolls out, the people behind Saind-Vide are already really into it, and i thought sharing it here could be a good place to create a soundboard and see how it could enroll within the edgeryders ecosystem\n\nHave a nice week!", "created_at": "2019-06-11 08:05:11.637531", "updated_at": "2019-06-11 08:05:11.637531", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 462, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 187.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 8, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66448, "user_id": 6036, "topic_id": 12037, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Ask the person who is speaking right now what their name is, and if they already have an edgeryders.eu account?

For ER, it is further highlighted in the section called \"What happens if something goes very wrong?\" in <a href=\"/edgeryders-as-social-enterprise-what-you-can-do-with-it\">this post</a> (2013). A non-executive director is a director who is removed from day-to-day management. As all directors, she has two powers:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\"right to know\": access to the admin group, financial records etc.</li>\n\n<li>one vote on the board of directors.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo, oversight is <em>normally</em> done by keeping an eye on what is going on \u2013 of course, this means there is quite a lot to read! \u2013 and giving advice. Advice is meant to be constructive (we are all building the same company, we are not opponents) and high-level (\"we should try to get more stuff going on health care\" is high-level advice: \"I think we should change our supplier of paper clip\" is low-level advice. Day-by-day decisions do not go to the board).\n\nIn the event of a major decision (merger, dissolution, strategic alliance...), oversight is also played out in the board. If a non-executive thinks the decision is wrong, she can and should inform the community and the public opinion; vote against the move; and resign in protest. All three moves will undermine the position of ER after that decision. In principle, it could even lead to company politicking, with, say, the two non-execs siding with two executive directors to overrule the other three. Of course, if it comes to that, we might as well go home.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-27 08:56:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:51.089490", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 299, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31095], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65467, "user_id": 5858, "topic_id": 11818, "post_number": 1, "raw": "(this post is a prototype and there is a high chance for it to be edited)\n(TO DO: add a video link that demonstrate the app and the software)\n\nHi, I am abdelmo'men from cairo, 21 years old, communication engineer student, games and anime, tech lover, power user and windows hater.\n\nteam members: @Ashraf_Taha  technical leader and main system developer \n@Mystero app developer and the one writing this topic :slight_smile: \n@MohamedAbkarino  Business professional ( in our hearts for sure <3 )\n\nA friend of mine had lung issues which got worse when he got in egypt. later i watched a program on NAT geo about climate change and how it's getting worse and worse every year.\nin fact, in india, asphalt is melting from extreme heat cause by increased greenhouse gases.\nhere in egypt, helwan used to be a tourist attraction with it's beautiful sight and fresh air.\nnow anyone living in helwan or even goes to helwan knows how terrible the weather have gotten.\nall because of the cement factories that have been established in helwan. \nwe can't close or move these factories so at least we're gonna decrease their effect.\n\nSDGs: (7), (11), (13), (15)  not all are targeted directly but definitely affected some form, shape or how.\n\nThere've been many attempts at that especially in helwan city but many were rejected for the very reason that we've been learning the past few days how to solve. an appealing business opportunity to convince these factories managers to implement a solution to help the environment while maintaining their businesses.\nWe're going to take further steps by developing that idea and improving the business model to take off from where the other attempts stopped, cutting down our profit margins to make it possible while maintaining a relatively sustainable startup.\nACD ( Air Compression Device ) is the main ingredient. we install it in the aforementioned factories.\n\ncompress the fumes to liquid that is highly concentrated which can then use to later and extract hydrocarbon derivatives.\nwe developed a software to manage our devices at all factories.\nwe also developed an app that will be deployed on play store and app store for the factory managers to contact us and review how much profit did they make.\nwe will start by covering biggest challenge yet and that is the factories in helwan city,\nshortly after the steel factories in 10th of Ramadan city.\npossible expansion we're studying is wood workshops that usually use laser for cutting and causes increasing rates of carbon mono oxide and we can also incorporate in our business model.\n\nA long term objective (and to me personally) is to cover the whole world\nprimarily MENA region,\nIndia: which is having it's own industrial revolution and will cause severe increase in CO2 levels from the factories and workshops,\nand China with its black sky during the day.", "created_at": "2019-11-23 18:46:53.404396", "updated_at": "2019-11-23 22:31:41.523482", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 485, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 22.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85451, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14462, "post_number": 39, "raw": "let me be more specific - In a situation like this, where threat and oppression (or possibility) are not immediately tangible or perhaps distributed across many different actors,  how do you filter between speculation, reported facts, disinformation etc ? i ask because I find it very difficult to do with the limited time, and more importantly, limited cognitive energy that I have at my disposal...", "created_at": "2020-10-21 08:45:22.466498", "updated_at": "2020-10-21 08:48:35.351449", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 63, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 22.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85448], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82595, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14185, "post_number": 27, "raw": "[quote=\"amelia, post:21, topic:14185\"]\nIf a machine could assign the same code as you\u2019re assigning, that\u2019s a good sign that you need to rethink how you\u2019re coding.

PMS seeks to understand the ways that our mental, physical, and social health is impacted by imbalances in and abuses of power. We can see that mobility, forced or otherwise, is an increasingly common aspect of life in the anthropocene. PMS is motivated to develop free tools of solidarity, resistance, and sabotage that respond to these conditions and are informed by a deep concern for planetary well-being. \u00a0PMS is working together to forge an accountability model of health that can function multilocally and without requiring place-based fixity or institutional support.\n\nThis accountability model for health - mental, physical, and social - will operate irrespective of place, and for all bodies seeking health care in assistance with all ailments and disempowerments. This tool would be informed by the integrated model of health implemented by the clinic at Bio.me in Thessaloniki and the mental health questionnaire developed by the Icarus Project in NYC, and other relevant tools we continue to encounter along the way. Inspired by the Bio.me system, our model functions as a\u00a0triage system that helps participants understand the complete picture of a person\u2019s health first through a longform interview, followed by periodic \u2018check-ins\u2019 or urgent calls with the committed group. \u00a0case \u2018health practitioners\u2019 are understood as those who share the responsibility of one another\u2019s health. This means that accountability works in all directions and that if we uphold certain procedures, everyone is capable of providing care. Following the initial long interview, a \u2018health card\u2019 is generated and shared among the team, which includes the care seeker. This serves as a health record that can be added to over time and that the care seeker can use in emergencies. Through long term support and awareness of individual and social patterns, the health care practitioners can connect health care seekers with local resources, provide consultation,\u00a0and solidarity.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-04-30 14:36:41", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 16:31:44.231802", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 345, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 343.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3067, 3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72839, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12879, "post_number": 88, "raw": "So, since last week @owen and I with help from @hugi and James have gotten this site up: work.edgeryders.eu.", "created_at": "2020-03-30 04:41:25.237650", "updated_at": "2020-03-30 04:41:25.237650", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 8.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [72631], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80508, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 10273, "post_number": 32, "raw": "no need to add in the template, we just need to update the list above in two categories of events (also identifying those that were the \"onboarding\" ones, as per the GA we need to have 12 in total, you told me there were 8 organized so far - which exactly are those?).

Heinously documented, not put online &amp; though I remember saying the phrase \"let's not bifurcate\" a lot, ultimately the enthusiasm bifurcated...\n\nThe bifurcation had a practical root - to do with resources, time, lack of funds to support it. Others wanted to steward the project but got distracted by their other work, families, health &amp; could not. I did not realise that my leadership and initiation of the group was a vital component of its existence &amp; my over emphasis on everyone\u2019s freedom was ultimately unhelpful to social organisation &amp; cohesion. I took on the workshops and AV and continued carrying the torch - but ran out of money to keep living in Brighton where I was, moved out to the countryside &amp; spectacularly ran out of energy at the CCC 2016. Still carrying this fire but agnostic about where I bring it. Now that I'm in Petersfield UK - finding people who are working towards the area becoming a Transition Town, who are tending the river networks and are standing against the Oil drilling of the Weald. Every place has it's own needs.\n\nOn the plus side of the cascade.network we didn\u2019t all destroy each other, or fall in love with each other and then destroy each other, which is a certain kind of success in group endeavours. The group experiment did not fall into wounds and trauma, sexual confusion, conflict and resentment. No one was nearly killed by the experience or driven half mad by it. We had a good knowledge exchange and the people it touched seemed opened, enlivened, emboldened. \n\nBut\u2026 my focus is how to make the impulse &amp; the work stronger &amp; more effective because the intention is creative action &amp; we are living in the context of this crazy risky moment of transition where nothing but completely radical action will do.\n\nSo how to give something of real value &amp; help shift a situation from not working or being actively toxic into health... I'm thinking towards 2020 - that that year is a meaningful goal for clearly working together  https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/07/these-experts-say-we-have-three-years-to-save-the-planet-from-irreversible-destruction/ \n\n*Here's some useful stuff on ways of going about Creative Activism*\n\nOn the subject of planning bold meetings good stuff over at Centre for Artistic Activism\n\nWhat we have learnt from history - \n\nhttps://artisticactivism.org/2016/11/c4aa-fundamentals-webinar-4-what-weve-learned-from-history/\n\nhttps://artisticactivism.org/2017/02/how-to-win-webinar-10-make-your-meetings-inventive/\n\n&amp; great resources here http://yeslab.org/kb\n\n*Nurture &amp; Patience*\n\nYou are very right about the challenge of nurture and getting a group to nurture itself without needing constant encouragement by particular people. That kind of resilient self organised network comes through time, hard knocks &amp; a shared understanding that if something is not working, that it's up to the person who is noticing to fix it, rather than complain/bitch/judge. The problem is that everyone is hardwired from how they've worked in more traditional companies and notions of \"the management\".  Sharing leadership &amp; systems for swapping stewardship feel really vital to avoid burn out and for that longterm goal... \n\nOne thing that helps is PATIENCE\n\nWith ourselves - \n\nthe last few years has been an extraordinarily painful personal learning about my weaknesses and ability to destroy my best efforts and not organise energy properly. Naivety is not helpful - I had a tendency to think that i could do many many things because I was animated by the feeling that it was vitally important. This feeling met the crushing realities of difference between people, everyday life, parenthood, resources and my real ineptness to use social media\u2026\n\n&amp; also patience with others \n\nand with how human beings actually are. \n\nI've been on a great learning about personality and the limits of change. That well intentioned people might want to change, that knocks &amp; failures certainly help shed naivety, but that changing habitual patterns takes time and support and is rarely complete. There's this realism emerging - mainly people only partially learn things and have a habit of remembering just a few things... We all tend to get swamped by our own lives sometimes. I like to think that I learnt about the problems of \u201ctrying\u201d to make something happen over the last few years, but then I look at my current state of affairs &amp; realise that my tendency to \"try\" to make things happen and naive enthusiasm that this time it will all work out is still prompting my actions. Habits of action are engrained in our biology - there's a noticing and re-wiring that's possible... &amp; difficult. As I (and many others) re-wire ourselves with respect to what we do not do well and work out how to *genuinely* put energy to good use and work together, there's a kind of hardcore deathless patience that's needed. Because we have to keep aware and change ourselves and how we work, whilst keeping on doing. \n\n&amp; If I\u2019m going to be real - I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve noticed many people get astoundingly wiser about their own weaknesses or completely overcome the bits of their characters that tend to alienate, confuse, splinter, cause trouble for all. &amp; that's part of the melting pot of being human, making trouble, being part of the trouble...\n\nI wonder what a meeting that has a sense of complete and open welcome to everyone combined with a really compassionate understanding about people\u2019s limits and flaws might be. That feels like what you are aiming at in the Care Conversation. It feels a good place to start and avoids the problem we talked about around carers vs. those who need care. \n\n*Mechanisms &amp; sessions to get people creating &amp; flowing*\n\nI'm really excited by the move at the OpenVillage to genuinely learn through courageous experiment and in friendship, with all the learning of the last decades.\n\nI'd love to see group mechanisms for getting people to play to their strengths actively &amp; creatively within the Open Village, because social situations can tend to split into spectators and active agents and - often - some of the best people, don't have any idea of what their strengths actually are or that they are allowed to use them.  I\u2019ve packed up the idea that collaboration is going to be a balanced affair - but there's a joy in friendship, encouragement and acceptance of how other people are in the moment. \n\nI wonder what mechanisms / games / workshops / group actions can be put in place that gets people to flowing together. I'd love to come and do some group dreamwork. Ie. An entirely optional session first thing in the morning to come and share the dreams that were had in the night. I've been learning from Apela Colorado about this practice and can only say that although it would take me many years of practice to really say why this is so effective at group meetings, that I have found it to be so. Group systems for mutually holding the unconscious forces of a group might be useful to our tendencies to unwittingly sabotage our best &amp; most concerted efforts. Feel like I've said this in the article I wrote, but I'd love to facilitate some dream work sessions. &amp; really encourage the existence of group dance, meditation and other activities through the day.\n\nSurprising ways of getting the web of creativity going is one way of getting through the armour of pessimism.  I hear a lot of people these days, burnt by the failures of past ventures, getting bitter and hard and talking about having their fingers in many pies so as to avoid being too troubled if one doesn't work out. To me, this sounds like a strange new way of \"not caring\". We do have to CARE &amp; actively try hard to not make the same mistakes - non-attachment is one thing - but speculative gambling to avoid committing just leads to a whole load of nothing. It's such an inhibitor of potential. All our eggs are in one basket ... and the basket is on fire.\n\nThere are many other effective ways of creating together and keeping the flow. \n\nA few from my experience -  \n\nSchumacher College https://www.schumachercollege.org.uk/ vitalises their educational experience with student organised group meetings each morning where different people bring short physical practices &amp; games, readings to bring everyone into the new day &amp; it also serves to communicate a clear map for the day - what's happening, whose doing the food... It works. And you really notice how sometimes you just wake up negative and need to be heaved back into flow. They also have great healthy hearty habits of building fires, clothes swaps, making puddings, doing ritual, singing together, storytelling, dancing - it has a spiritual cohesion that is rare. On a less good tip - it's fucking expensive which leaves most people out of it.\n\nCOP21 at the ZAD - self organisation that worked well mainly because of the urgency of the climate meeting &amp; a level of care &amp; focus given by the event following so shortly after the bombing in Paris.  The thing that made this one work so well was the shared commitment to a greater cause - it gave the space feeling of camaraderie, trust, helpfulness, gifting, community, sharing info.  \n\nThe Chaos Computer Club in 2015 also had a similar community spirit, loads of people interacting with a will to experiment &amp; hack prototypes, set up spontaneous meetings, share experience, exchange networks, DANCE together - on a less good tip - well, there's everything about the negatives of technology culture, new elites rising, tech worship that has not yet plugged into wisdom and care...\n\nThe Warp Experience in the 90s in London - this one really shifted me with its open, mind bending, hilarious &amp; inspiring concoction of theatre, workshops, talks, wild dance, a hot tub. It was a liberty space of organic flow, wild experimentation and spontaneous creativity. Like all expressions of liberty, liberty lasts a short while and then rots unless it is tended to transform into something else - and these negatives became more visible, there was no real help to those who were vulnerable (except the social radar that sometimes worked well), there was mental fall out, sexual predation, guru culture and power conflicts, hedonism culture always means lots of talk and less action and its got a shadow of addiction and escapism, and no one really understood how hard it would be or how long it would take...\n\nOne conclusion I take from all this is that true creativity is the secret ingredient. The Warp may have been wild &amp; chaotic and bitten the dust but it spawned its seeds, to America and the Cosmic Trigger rising in the UK is all part of its growth through time. Real creative experience has organic effects that continue and seed new life, even if you can't account for them in reports - they often have much more power than really thought-through planned experiences... I've certainly been to a lot of conferences and formal meetings which have not shifted me. \n\nSomething that keeps coming  to me about the Open Village is TIME \n\nThe question of - what lasts? what's useful? how can we inhabit this time with power?\n\n&amp; what's possible for October? Which is not so long away...\n\nI have one thought that keeps rising on taking this notion of the caring healthy self-organised group out into the city.   Few respond well to shouty negative activism. Fear is not the great communicator... Part of the cascade project was around slow culture hacks.  Activism that emphasises changing the pace of the city and foregrounding presence, vulnerability and the beauty of the earth. The dance groups on the streets for the COP21 shifted me.  \n\nBeen thinking about action on the streets &amp; since culture is obsessed with excitement - anything too high paced is likely just to feed the machine and be yet another ride on the wheel... For where there is hectic business, there is all the distraction, blindness and madness of this suicidal culture.  This sense that \u201cthe time is now\u201d can be met by something present. Instead of putting that intense feeling into multiple short-lived projects, to make energy matter. To use energy with real intention. One way of spreading courage and alternatives is to be in total presence.  What about an action that expressed a great slowing down into presence during the Open Village? Slowing down the pace of the streets with movement. Done a few things like this before - I led a slow motion walk up Oxford high street in the last decade to protest the Iraq war. So - what about a short workshop and then an action of dancing slowly (in whatever your style) in the streets? Gifting pieces of fruit to passers by? A way of spreading the invitation. I've made mistakes in the past about acting before the time is ripe. Doing too much. In rushed ways. Not preparing long enough to really pull it off. There is a mastery to carpe diem - in plucking the day when it is ripe. If that can tie in with urban game  you are working on - great - I'm on for this &amp; looking out for times and places for this creative plan.\n\nStripping things back. I think it is all about caring, realism and presence, and for me - whatever the outcome - joy. Events can unleash creative energy + knowledge. So I love events that combine enacting purpose with great up-to-date info exchange, tools and realistic sharing of experience &amp; melding that with infinite welcome, friendship and heartfelt (some might call it spiritual) unity. &amp; if we hit the sweet spot, participating in the network can catalyse personal understanding and meaning in the personal lives of all those that come participate - that's a good feedback loop.  Meeting together can open up new potentials for people to see how their own creativity can be part of meaningful radical action if it's held in a solid creative authentic container. The reason I got drawing chalk doors on the walls of Paris &amp; planting seeds across the city during cascade.network was to invoke this strength.  Doors where we see walls. Might be poetic. But the effort's so tough, it needs poetry.\n\n&amp; diversity!\n\nWhilst I am attempting to school myself in cybernetics to become a real structural thinker, I still think like a creative and have a lot to learn. A variety of very different kinds of people who share values &amp; can play to their strengths and accept the limits of others, might be more powerful than a group of people who are all exactly on the same page. Functional groups needs the grumpy pessimist, the young &amp; enthused, the spontaneous creative, the radical wild card, the focused logician, the butterfly generalist, the pragmatic parent, the radically honest, the contextualisers and historians, the future-thinkers, an elder and groups desperately needs the people who've had it hardest and have learnt lessons most are lucky never to learn. My work - creative, research, teaching - has often kept me in a solitary pattern &amp; I'm trying to break that pattern in myself as I truly come to understand that we not only need to know ourselves but we also need each other - in all our different forms - to make action together &amp; give that action the best possible support. \n\nThese years have made me agnostic to style &amp; aesthetics. What moves me is whether someone means it, because then there's possibility for learning and acting. Commitment and care is a helluva lot more important than uniting over style or even personality. Commitment and care are solid foundations for the humility and superhuman patience to work with people you may not necessarily vibe with all the time...\n\nOk - that's my attempt to share some experience.\n\n&amp; wait - my god - if I learnt anything from the Cascade it would be the communication. The project was an attempt to unite behind a purpose, act boldly and tell the story as we did it.  But my god, did I discover how terrible at leaving a documented trail I was. Spent a lot of time with sound artist Leah Barcalay who was tweeting for one of the massive eco twitter accounts during that conference. She'd trained herself to tweet every minute or so. Open Village can make it easy for young people to attend and take up this communicative role - that would be a great idea. The social reach. The story told by many different storytellers. I was really naive about this when Cascading.\n\n&amp; beautiful documentation carries the spirit on into the future. Unmonastery felt pretty great at this - I was not involved at all in this project - but through the videos &amp; presentations that project moved me. &amp; this one http://www.open-frames.net/changing-tents/\n\nHere are some events going on in the UK in August with some similar values -\n\nBalance Unbalance http://balance-unbalance2017.org/ - I'm going to this, it's great\n\nEarth First! http://earthfirstgathering.org/\n\nIntergalactic camp 17th-24th August\n\nhttps://zadforever.blog/2017/07/13/come-to-the-intergalactic-week-17-24-august/\n\n&amp; final question \n\nThe plan to hold \"11 days of living differently\" in Brighton &amp; the attempt to live on a different economic exchange, inside an open creative lab, sharing tools/ knowledge &amp; a city wide game did not work because we realised that we needed to provide support if it was going to be a real invitation. ie. more than an arty kinda project. If it was going to be an invite that people could answer and participate in without getting burnt out and becoming penniless in the process it needed some self-funding structure that could tend it &amp; support people who were on lower income... Experimenting with Brighton's GoodMoney or one of the ethical cryptocurrencies like FairCoin was the idea, but frankly I don't know enough about this. \n\nMy main point here is that it is vital to support people in being able to take up a bold invitation - otherwise it's a radical possibility for those with the privilege to meet it, in that people live in a radically unequal context with totally different kinds of resources. If it's an open invite for people to make their own way to the \"experiment\" that risks only receiving folk who can commit to risks like that (eg. folks on PHD scholarships like me.) That's not healthy representative variety. &amp; many \"utopian\" meetings I attended over the decades died because they were basically wedded to capitalism and the inequalities of that system at their foundations. I\u2019m really interested how you guys are going to meet this problem. Nadia mentioned cryptos... &amp; I will catch up with Frank about this next week - about how people can be fairly supported to take up the invitation. In 2017, we all have to take risk. But we also gotta make the effort to try and share the level of risk - something that is a manageable risk to one person, might genuinely destroy another person's ability to survive. Looking forward to learning from you all on this.\n\n*If I copy edit your copy, can someone consider writing bullet point summaries of mine ; ) \n\nShort form writing is not my strength...", "created_at": "2017-07-30 18:15:19.938772", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:05.927780", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3275, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 22.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34714, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6785, "post_number": 5, "raw": "The thing about selling crafts is that you really need to work on the distribution channels, design and packaging on top of the economics for this to be profitable. @Yosser and @Matthias I think here @Susa can really help with the product design.

Initially, the treads are indexed by codes with ethnographic meanings. Second the network of codes are described to identify structure of thinking associated with interacting people.\n\nThis methodology seems to be generic, that means, it could be applied to various sets of texts. It should deliver a quantified (quantifiable) description of the thinking of people and its structure. I see very valuable potential in the method. Its mixed subjective-objective features (see below) should be turned to be a strength.\n\nThe \u201aindexing by codes\u2018  may be a common or divers filter applied to the text, depending whether it is conceived being part of the data-generation or analytical part of the activity. To me, it seems needed to have \u201etraining / test sets of text\u201c to control the indexing /coding; going beyond means to reduce the inter-coder-variability. I wonder about the bias (measurable ?) that could be introduced by given coders. Possibly, this problem is well-known; but the network analysis my give a means to quantify / assess its \u201esize\u201c and, subsequenttly, to turn it into a source of information.  \n\nBeing speculative: Through assessing the \u201ainter-coder-variability\u2018 possibly the \u201ajust words paradigm\u2018 could be analysed.

Of course you should not put up a fist fight, I never suggested anything of the sort, and it seems a strange conclusion to draw from my statements.\n\nThis situation is not that I 'find Patrick's approach too tough, and yours too soft', but rather that your approach is not as soft as you make it out to be.\n\nYou advocate even-handedness and adopt a conciliatory tone, i.e. \"<em>Arthur, we have done good work together; I wish you well</em>\" but the positive statements are barbed with passive aggressive suggestions about <a href=\"/u/arthurd\">@ArthurD</a> needing to \"<em>find piece of mind</em>\" and that \"<em>It saddens me to see a man of that age and experience resort to personal insult and misrepresentation.</em>\" This is what I feel is manipulative. It paints Arthur as unhinged and immature, it cheapens any conciliatory or constructive statements you make, and whether you feel that way about Arthur or not, <strong>it is simply not helpful to mention it</strong>. It's not helpful for the discussion, it's not helpful for Arthur, and it's not helpful for the community perception of you or Edgeryders LBG.\n\n\"<em>What would you suggest as an appropriate reaction to allegations you have committed a criminal offense?</em>\"\n\n1) A statement of your innocence, and the evidence for that innocence.\n\n2) nothing more.\n\nBoth you and <a href=\"/u/patrick_andrews\">@Patrick_Andrews</a> have, in my eyes, adequately provided 1), but failed miserably at 2).\n\n\"<em>do you not think your own gut reaction should have been to ask everyone to stand down and go back to civil interaction?</em>\"\n\n<s>Yes, I do think everyone should stand down</s>. I never supported or condoned Arthur's position. But it seemed to me from the comments that Arthur is not going to have much to do with ER LBG from here on, whereas Patrick will be taking a leading role. His first interaction with a community member since taking on the role was being challenged and accused of wrongdoing. This is tough, but it's particularly important to be able to rise above personal remarks and lead by example, especially at a time when the relationship between ER LBG and the ER community is so sensitive.\n\nMy intention (and I think this was clear to most observers) was not to pick sides, or to suggest that only one person's language was inappropriate, and everything else was fine. I don't have a horse in this race. But it's going to take some time for Patrick to grow into his role, and I wanted to remind him of the importance of his position and his relationship with the ER community, and urge more care in online interactions, even when the conduct of those he is interacting with may leave a lot to be desired.", "created_at": "2017-08-06 21:08:17.154420", "updated_at": "2017-08-06 21:08:17.154420", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 654, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 46.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35899, "user_id": 2095, "topic_id": 7006, "post_number": 3, "raw": "If there were a way we can create a database with the following or maybe more headlines:\nDeadline:\nType: accelerator / scholarship / fellowship / fund / call for proposal\nField:\nNationalities:\nAge:\nName of the offering organisation:\nOrganisation page link:\nApplication link:\nComments:\nAnd invite various organisation and entrepreneur to build this database for the use of Edgeryders network.

Its commitment to the principles of the Commons, Open Cooperativism and P2P makes it a prototypical example of a new generation of co-ops connecting the Commons and cooperative movements. Their position is that a truly collaborative economy can only develop when it\u2019s commons-based.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/470503113\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe principles to which the CIC refers are:\n\n### Social Transformation\n\n- Interest in the common good and feeling good about oneself\n- Detaching from materialism\n- Cooperation and solidarity in social transformation.\n- Transition based on the day to day and getting closer and closer to converting utopia into reality\n- Direct relationship between practical action and its theory.\n- Inclusive and networked cooperative for the whole society\n\n### Society\n\n- Equity and social justice\n- Equality in diversity\n- Self-realization and mutual help\n- Compromise and self-criticism\n- Share our experiences with the whole society.\n\n### Economy\n\n- Attending to the needs of people before any other interest and each contributing according to their possibilities.\n- Money is a system for measuring the exchange between the people of the community, excluding accumulation as a goal.\n- Other non-monetary forms of exchange are promoted: free economy, direct exchange, community economy.\n- Establish economic relations between producers and consumers: the cooperative will guide in order to calculate the right prices on the basis of its costs, its own needs and those of consumers.\n- The cooperative will inform producers of consumers' needs to guide their production.\n- ECOcoops (the cooperative's currency) will never be convertible into euros and no type of interest is accepted on its loan.\n\n### Ecology\n\n- Ecology and permaculture\n- Degrowth and sustainability\n\n### Political organization\n\n- Democracy: direct, deliberative, participatory.\n- Self-management and decentralization.\n\n### Transparency.\n\n- Subsidiarity: from local to global.\n- Assemblearismo\n\nWe had the opportunity to talk with Joel, a co-founder of the community who will explain in the coming webinar how the CIC was born and how it works.\n\nJoel is a filmmaker who studied sociology and anthropology and who tried for twenty years to find alternatives to capitalism. Moving from Spain to South America and coming back in 2007 when the crisis was almost at its peak, he contacted the author of a book that interested him and they decided to fix up an old house to provide a place to work together.\n\nThey founded Catalan Integral Cooperative, an organisations that act as infrastructure for people businesses and ideas. A community where everything is possible:\n\n- Engineers became farmers;\n- Academics distribute food in local networks;\n- Scientific scepticism is brought to the government;\n- The individual knows best what they need and act in the network to do achieve it;\n- The ideal is to listen to all of us;\n- They make lists on how to make the world better and then do it;\n\nSometimes craftsmen go to them tell them what they do/need and then they discover how they can save money to buy other things through the social currency.\n\nIn Sweden, there was a doctor that went there to revamp the hospitals every 2 years. In education, they did the same: they started school and many other projects. All these things involve people so the basic concept is to give them a place in exchange of something they can offer back to the community.\n\n- Why is it free, how does it work?- someone might ask\n- What do you do?- They say\n- I am a graphic designer\u201d\n- Do you have a hobby?\n- I love baking cookies\n- Bring some!\n\nWith this simple but powerful idea over time, they have access to local beer, or self-made toothpaste or many things like that in social currency.\n\nSo new initiatives are born around the cooperative and some of them become independent, and to attract more and more people they promote the CIC especially through social networks:\n\n\u201cStop using the central currency - come to our cooperative and use Social Currency\u201d\n\nThere are around 500 people involved in the cooperative, but they have thousands of associates. Many of them have their own expenses so the economists of the cooperative balanced the cooperative incomes with these expenses so they are able to report less to the state who has trouble to define this community for what it really is.\n\nThe internal economy of the CIC is based on a diversified economy:\n\n- Gift economy (the idea is that I don\u2019t want to be your consumer, but I want to create a friendship/human relation)\n- Exchange\n  - Social Currency (20% of the total economic money used in the cooperative)\n- An ethical cryptocurrency (fair coins)\n- Not ethical cryptocurrency\n- Euros\n  - they rented a house in a beautiful village for very little in exchange for fixing little bits, they are renting now for 10 people for 600 euro.\n\nAn Integral Cooperative is a tool to build a counter-power from the base, starting from self-management, self-organization and direct democracy, and which allows us to transition from the current state of dependence on the structure of the system, towards a scenario of freedom with full awareness, free from authority, and where everyone can develop in equal conditions and opportunities.

However, the ethnographic team led by @amelia and including myself, @SZdenek, @Jan and @Wojt  has proceeded simultaneously with the coding of the material on our platform. This process should provide insight into how all of the POPREBEL communities, clustered around their respective languages of communication see the issues that our project seeks to understand. This brief report attempts to present findings relevant to the Czech forum, which were..\n\n**BIG Topics**\n\nIt was only logical that the first major matter emanating from the forum was the issue of healthcare. It was an opener for our discussion and remained relevant further on, appearing in different contexts. The intensity of the healthcare discussion on the Czech forum resulted in its \"branching out\" when represented in the GraphRyder with cooccurrence threshold set on k=4 a centred on the overall POPREBEL view:\n\n![Health 1 - k4|690x298](upload://oLHDY9p32dgCl0tp4tgKlEkGS6u.jpeg) \n\nWhat generally appears to be a backbone and connection of the healthcare to the POPREBEL is an unsatisfactory treatment that people receive in the Czech public healthcare system, while the expenses in the private sphere are not the only problem of finding an alternative, as the quality of the latter has been put under scrutiny and received ambiguous assessment as well. When centering on `healthcare` as a node, the picture of adjacent nodes and edges turns out to be the following:\n\n![Health 2|690x557](upload://58aCUPe5hxHB32CQcQOnjpTCHIf.jpeg) \n\nThe issues of healthcare seem to spill over to the areas of social relations and structures on one hand and general \"grand\" issues of the society, be it economical and political. The health care discussion as a whole elucidates two underlying narratives which form a bridge to other areas. First one is a theme of looking for an alternative, a third way of problem-solving, which would not rely on neither public (state-sponsored and thus politically dependant) nor private sphere. The second is both implicit and explicit perception of socially and economically predatory behavioural patterns which transverse different spheres, be it in the healthcare system or politics, combined with lack of will to assume responsibility for one's deeds.\n\nBoth of these narratives framed the second major topic, the discussion about housing. The situation in Czechia has indeed become dire, especially for those living in big cities. A brief look at the term `housing` provides an overview of major concerns, be it lack of solutions provided by both the public and the private stakeholders and illustrates the necessity of personal agency leading to desperation from the impossibility of the situation  produced by inadequate conditions:\n\n![Housing 3|690x535](upload://ydrSkLqCPex1nUcvtvCzpoaX8SX.jpeg)\n\nIt is interesting though, to observe the direct connection of the housing issues to the third major theme, environmental problems and topics of climate change. Very fluently, the housing problems became a part of a framework which could be called an \"ecology of life\", a way of thinking about the spatiality and quality of one's living in Czechia in rather global terms.\n\n**Where to next?**\n\nIt seems that the current situation is, unfortunately, presenting us with an opportunity to agglomerate the aforementioned tpics around the current COVID-19 outbreak. The recent experiences have definitely shifted the attention of the Czech society toward the healthcare system and what more, the current government has not seldomly come into conflict with those, who actually work in the healthcare system, One can feel that there is an uncertainity shared by those who provide the services and the clients of how it will hold facing the second wave, which is raging throughout the population as of now.\n\nFurthemore COVID has drastically change the way we lead our lives, repeated lockdowns have pushed us into our dwellings. As for some, it might be quite relaxed expereinces, for many, who share their aparmtents, have to take care of their children or were sent by the Unievrsities back to their parents' homes, it represents the exact opposite. \n\nFurthermore, COVID has overshadowed the issues of sustainabilty and environmental care, but these were not magically resolved, the persist and with the economy probably coming through a shock during the next, there might an opening for accepting a new normality, which will inculde a mindset more careful about how and in which way we as individuals and our society perpetrate the current production-consumption pattern.\n\n**How to get there?**\n\nTo summarize all that was said above,w e propose the following themes to be taken into consideration when discussing the future development of our community all in reference to the COVID:\n\n* **gender** , via work patterns, educaiton, leisure time, and a division of labour that is having to be negotiated/brings existing disparities to the fore, as childcare falls upon women much more.\n* **housing** , including intergenerational relations\n* **healthcare** - access and inequality, reflections on the system and its relation to politics\n* **anti-LGBT sentiment and relationship to ethnic minorities and refugees** - via scapegoating, etc. can also approach this via **anti-intellectualism** \u2014 particularly in the covid setting, around relationships to covid (e.g. is it a government/elite play for power or a legitimate public health issue)\n\nWe beleive the resulting discussion will be productive and enlightening.", "created_at": "2020-10-16 12:16:53.093392", "updated_at": "2020-10-17 12:02:20.628119", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 893, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 58.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4793, 6484, 3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39407, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 7662, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[quote=\"alberto, post:1, topic:7662\"]@matthias, can you please remind me how we use encryption, and for what?[/quote]\n\nSSL encryption (\"HTTPS\", provided by LetsEncrypt) is used for the transfer of all data (incl. the request URL) between our servers and web visitors.

I have connected all the loose ends I had to connect by the end of last year. \n\n**The event in Poland** was a great success, and you can read the reports on the Polish community, written by several attendees - Kaya, Aska, Robert, me. There's one more promised for January from one of our speakers. We had around 50 people in the audience, some great speakers, actually, a stellar lineup, and some very good screenings. We received very positive reviews of the event, and the organisation was incredibly friendly and smooth. We have a great, no-drama relationship with @AskaBednarczyk and, luckily, our hosts turned out to be the sweetest people in Warsaw. It was perfect. And the food! Damn. Wonderful, plant-based banquet for our guests. \n\n**The event in Prague** went relatively well, not in terms of attendance, which was a bit underwhelming (10 of us in the room), but in terms of quality - I'd say, it was a success. As much as I could understand of the talk, there was a deep discussion between participants about all kinds of future uses of the platform and the way it could evolve and become more engaging in the future. Thanks to @kuba_svehla enthusiasm and natural talent for connecting people, and @Jirka_Kocian's great help, they are indeed building something solid out there. A real sense of community. \n\n**This is a list** of responses to the event, with Kubarczyk's link still missing. \n\n1. https://edgeryders.eu/t/my-festival-registration-response-by/11859\n2. https://edgeryders.eu/t/my-festival-registration-response-by-tomasz/11731\n3.  https://edgeryders.eu/t/my-festival-registration-response-by/11675\n4.  https://edgeryders.eu/t/my-festival-registration-response-by/11714\n5. https://edgeryders.eu/t/rzady-prawa-czy-rzady-przez-prawo-o-autorytarnym-liberalizmie-sadow/11913\n6. https://edgeryders.eu/t/kobieta-w-polsce/12107\n7.

I knew that their slogan \"fair and balanced\" was deliberate doublespeak within days of their first broadcast.  It was clearly propaganda along the lines of what I imagined Pravda was like in its heyday.\n\nDoes Fox matter in the USA?  I will say straight out that no Fox News, no Trump Presidency and no GOP as we know it today.  Trump says things designed to do two things: outrage his opponents to keep them agitated and angry, and outrage his supporters to keep them agitated and angry too.  He says things every day that are patently absurd to anyone paying reasonable attention to facts and history.  But he knows that Fox will trumpet them endlessly as The Truth, widening the divide between the political polarities.  It is as masterful as it is disgusting.\n\nAnd now in this era of social media, as the article points out, you might not even need a Fox News to amplify your divisive notions.

Below are the thoughts I contributed to her:*\n\nCurrently I am reading Kevin Kelly's *\"[What technology wants](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7954936-what-technology-wants)\"*, and while it is true all technology and science is *\"building on the shoulders of giants\"* it becomes devastatingly clear to be the case with *[code](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)*. Increasingly, the features, the size of your lego blocks so to say, grow. Especially since the rise of Github, Pastebin and Stackoverflow (each of these merit their own essays you may read if you want to, but [here's a tweet](https://twitter.com/haoel/status/695490584325152768)), *open collaboration* is always too big to ignore. Incidentally, *intense communication* through various tools is also essential. Unless you're one of the best coders in the world, writing any substantial amount of code yourself is usually the wrong solution.\n\nAnyway, I've thought about technology development a lot, combined with the nature of work. Most colleagues study outside of work hours to be able to do the work. I have some productivity addiction, which gets weird when it's any sort of *knowledge you're producing*, not chairs or other physical items. If I could just replicate work I've done over and over, or even teach it, it would be so efficient. But I'm forced to learn new things to *keep up with development*, reaching higher and higher levels of abstraction. Because of this discrepancy - doing dishes will always take effort, teaching a team Git gets easier but learning new things always take mental effort - I've sketched a way of thinking about effort using *different currencies* such as time, monetary cost, experience required and mental effort (mana). So I'm a pretty high level IT wizard who can do a lot of things even at no cost, but it will cost time and mana. Also I get a *specialization penalty* for low mana tasks *(find reference on how Richard Stallman describe hackers as the wizards of the future?)*.\n\nOne concept important to systems and software development is *the ability to assemble (and to take apart again)*. Many systems are like dolls, ready assembled and you won't open or change them. Open software however mostly comes partially assembled (legs, hands, whatever, parts always being reused for other models) but you will have the *source code available* and there are distributions that are made to be *automatically assembled* right on your laptop. Back around year 2000 getting a Linux system to work could take several days or weeks, but now I *spawn new computers several times per day*. It has led to the expression *\"treat your servers like cattle, not pets\"*, because if one misbehave you should be able to put it down and reproduce it from source code. This beautiful *process of bootstrapping* never seize to amaze me and tools like autoconf, automake, gcc and yum make it happen.\n\nFinally, I feel like I have studied too much. The *accreditation of a masters degree* (imagine a lengthy list of impressive courses and grades) is a terribly inefficient way to weed out who is fit for the job, especially since there now are MOOC trainings for most thinkable subjects, not rarely for free. I believe that while excellent in parts, for many jobs, the significance of university education will diminish in favor of *more efficient qualifiers*. However, while I have *all this knowledge and experience*, I have a passion to make the best use of it and *enable others*. Any way you can think of to take part in that would be pretty awesome.\n  \n  \n*PS. Below are some notes which didn't fit anywhere else:*\n\n* [ComputerCraft EDU v2](http://youtu.be/ADTb6ifxWxw) (Minecraft, version 2 has the simplified GUI) is very cute. Combining programming with Minecraft is a pretty promising environment to learn programming\n* When I searched for [Curly Bracket](http://curlybracket.se/) I found a fun series from [Swedish Radio P1](http://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt?programid=4741)", "created_at": "2019-11-28 14:07:38.863730", "updated_at": "2020-12-10 18:49:44.968575", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 712, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 148.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4022, 4861, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8771, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3722, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Thanks Nico!</b>\n\n<span>One for\u00a0</span><a href=\"/u/caroline\" style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 32.6400032043457px;\">@Caroline_Paulick-Thiel</a><span>\u00a0and stewarding physical assets.</span>\n\nUnfortunately my poor Italian won't let me understand most of the content of the video, probably also because the sound is not perfect.\u00a0\n\nWhat stays with me is that caring for physical assets -eg abandoned or unfunctional public spaces - needs participation and cooperation with both public authorities and related associations, and potentially large effort to align incentives.\n\nGennaro rightly understands stewardship as beyond managing an asset - but being self critical and taking responsibility to care for it.

Small breakfast with the guys, short briefing with @symorin, lots of questions to ask all of them. About Edgeryders, about their projects, experiences, and about mine too. Confronting and discussing our different ways to put something in perspective.\nWe all needed to go to Essaouira that day. Lots of things to do there. Mainly, it was about getting and welcoming @johncoate from his arrival by bus. All the way from California. I was looking to meet the man and have some time to chat with him. And it turned out that he was also looking for the same with me (wich still seems a little incredible but\u2026 okay! ahah). We also needed to go to the supermarket, and to the tool shop / mechanic shop to find some pieces for the bikes.\nSo we all, except @matthias, went to get the bus. 30Min walk again from the house to Essaouira. I was basically going from a discussion to another. @SyMorin and Ahmad were chatting about the situation of engineer employement in Tunisia, and I never figured what @alberto and @hazem were talking about, as the panorama still amazed me and didn\u2019t help my focus that much\u2026 Obviously, I also was recording the sounds around us, taking pictures, and videos\u2026\n<p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/77c54e80530d3b71b7064570812dc0e25c59b416.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1073b2777322465f892451189059a1a3a2ee5b9d.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/966f2898c2756239f75acbaafa4eb7f471790f90.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></div>\n<p>\n<p>\n* **_Khadija\u2019s sardinas, obviously, and the fruits and vegetables flying shops_**\nAs soon as we arrived at Essaouira, @alberto and @hazem plans our afternoon there. We didn\u2019t have that much time actually, so we had to figure out the best way to do everything. But it started like the day before: grabbing some food. We definitely went to Khadija\u2019s little cantine, and asked for those sardinas. We had to.\nJust after finishing his tajin, @hazem headed to the bus station earlier than us in order to catch @johncoate as soon as possible. We eventually met them back at the entrance at the medina. Along the way, I checked many small street \u201cflying\u201d shops selling fruits and vegetables, just like the day before in the medina. It\u2019s crazy how many they are. Though the quantities of fruits and vegetables sold, and produced then, have to be impressive as well. But the distribution network was the one question that I kept in my head for long. Definitely not the same patterns as we have in France. And then, as I presupposed before traveling there, definitely not the same semantic and words regarding its organization and labeling.\n<p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d5da4fcb27c9292780379a44abd31a978a6f18c2.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ef97851754fd4a5e6fbfa3622b344f0552939e45.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dd5b68002c2d762247439bbb8c8c9617baa49cef.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></div>\n<p>\n<p>\n\n* **_Supermarket time baby_**\nAnyway, @johncoate was now with us. We walked quite some time across the city to get to the supermarket. We went through different neighbohoods, with different architecture styles. Middle class houses and residencies, commerces and services, shops, and this big big recycling area that looked like paradise to me. @hazem then told me that @matthias and himself found every tool they have now at the house in this recycling zone: I BET YOU DID! (I was very jealous, and still am\u2026)\nA few adventures titled \u201c@hazem and the bike pieces\u201d later, that actually left @johncoate and I enough time to briefly chat about our radio experiences, we finally attempted the supermarket. And its cheeses\u2026 horrible vision for the cheesemonger that I am. Everything from the butter to the \u201clocal\u201d things was industrially made. So, that was it. Basically, it closed my folder. If there was any local cheese made in Essaouira\u2019s region, the only place to find it would be directly at the producer\u2019s place or a weekly farmers market somewhere. And of course, I had no time to dig further in that direction. Frustration frustration. But hey\u2026 I had answers and leads. In two days, with such a switch in the initial plans, it had to be satisfying.\n<p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/34f81c24dec10e304663dfa563abef82dad71dea.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1204fd5745220f5fc6b8ba8137583d5437142dab.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"><p><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a8f0b590637fd166a3ca4c27291e085e510cdd85.jpg\" width=\"517\" height=\"690\"></div>\n<p>\n<p>\n\n* **_back at the house, last evening with the team_**\nAs we were one more, and probably not fitting the little bus, we chose to get back to house by taxis. I went with @SyMorin and @johncoate. As soon as we were back at the house, my plan was basically to transfer all the recordings and footages I had in my equipment to my hard drive, and then, set the fire and take some time with the team for the last evening with them. I missed making a proper fire, and John joined me for some help. That\u2019s how our discussion started. We obviously ended talking about the local-scale and related concepts. He catched quickly my vision of it as both a tool and a solution to confront the emergencies of the present, and build a more inclusive future. And he also enhanced it with his own experiences he humbly shared with me. I couldn\u2019t hope for a best way to start the evening, and I look forward for our next meeting John!\nThe fire was burning, and @alberto was in the kitchen cooking some classic italian student plate. The atmosphere was cool and warm. @symorin was on the desert: strawberries and chocolate. The main event of the night was Space X. @matthias was connected to the streaming and we all watched it before dinner. That was my last meal with them all, and your pastas were awesome @alberto. As a daily routine, I made some infusion with plants. We had fun around that thing, because the first one we did was with tap water (ping @symorin ahah), and tap water is very salty there\u2026 \nAfter discussions and discussions again, I went to bed exhausted but feeling great. My first experience with Edgeryders had been as cool as possible. I could have used a few more days, but hey\u2026\n\n* **_trying to get back to France_**\nWell, everything is said: TRYING.\nAs both @symorin and I were heading to Marrakesh in Samir\u2019s taxi (our driver from the beginning), I learned by text message that my flight with Transavia was cancelled due to the snow in Paris. It drove me nuts, since I already landed in Paris under a snowstorm\u2026 I had another flight to catch the day after that, and plenty of stuff to do with that short time in between. So I bought a Royal Air Maroc ticket for the afternoon. But guess what: as I waited as chill as possible at the airport, writing down the summary of this article, and a couple reflections about a project, the speaker said my RAM flight was also canceled\u2026 Hours after that, RAM finally said that we (all the passengers from that flight) will be taken care of, in a 5* hotel for the night, and then we\u2019ll take a place in the morning, for Paris via Casablanca. This plane got it to Paris. I arrived at my crib 2 hours before my other plane. And as they say in sports: the rest is history ahah!\n\n## SPECIAL THANKS:\n\n- @unknown_author, for introducing me to this ER platform and community\n- @symorin, for being a great partner in crime during those two days, and for what\u2019s yet to come\n- @anique.yael, for our patience and answers during the whole set up\n- @nadia, for that chat in that caf\u00e9 in Paris. A discussion that resonated a lot during my days at the Open village.\n- the whole team in the house: @matthias, @hazem, Ahmad, @alberto, @johncoate, and the cat behind the door. You all rock!\n\n## NOW WHAT?\n- @symorin and I are still investigating fresh food cycles in Morocco. We\u2019re now digging contacts and trying to put a workflow in place in order to write and do things. We are also interrogating the semantic used, the terms and words that reference everything there. And of course, the laws. Future will tell what will eventually come out of this.\n- I\u2019m developping my mapping project more and more, and look forward to pitch it to you all here. I don\u2019t know when, but I will.\n- I\u2019m opening the access to everything I recorded and collected from my days there, to anybody that would like to use it on/for this platform. And I\u2019m also trying to find some time to edit some of them in shortcuts.\n\n_**Hope you enjoyed that little feedback, and that it will give you the feeling that you should be a part of that Open Village.**_\n\n**Cheers from France.**", "created_at": "2018-02-19 23:47:30.657320", "updated_at": "2018-03-09 19:27:48.095013", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1538, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 275.0, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 2915, 1935, 347, 3791, 4085], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67573, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12081, "post_number": 12, "raw": "wait - what??? got url?", "created_at": "2019-12-16 18:29:22.719576", "updated_at": "2019-12-16 18:29:22.719576", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 18.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [67572], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63335, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 10674, "post_number": 35, "raw": "No worries.\nMy initial idea was to visit one of the spaces that Isabelle identified as not used and which would be good candidate buildings for The Reef, for the purpose of the Co-design exercise.

It was functioning well for some time, but now there is a need for a structure - as we grow as a team, and as the ongoing projects demand alignment and better overview of what is happening across teams in NGI and POPREBEL.\n\nFrom now on, these calls will be **facilitated conversations based on the agenda**. We are going to have the facilitator, the note taker and the time keeper. @IvanC and @bojanbobic we can switch between these roles for every call if you're interested in trying it out. \n\nThe calls are going to be limited to **max 1h30**. It can also be much shorter, depending on the period. This is how it's going to look like:\n\n-  on Mondays before the call, a provisional agenda is shared on riot and people are asked to add items on the list. The agenda is concluded by the end of that day and posted on the platform. \n- all team leaders should attend. Everyone else is welcome (also depending on the agenda, at times it might be useful to invite for example other community managers to listen-in. The team leaders decide on that). \n- If the leaders are not able to attend (and if no one can replace them from their team), they comment under the agenda and post a short summary of their updates, in a few sentences. This is then read by the facilitator during the call, in the timeslot dedicated for that team, the questions are noted. \n- proposed structure: \n\n   - **welcome by the facilitator, quick walk through the agenda + \"tour de table\"** (max 10 mins): to check-in, participants share one news from their personal life in one simple sentence. For example, \"I am currently enjoying reading this book\", or \"I started practicing new sport activity\" or \"I'm feeling tired because it's raining\" etc. This is not obligatory, if you don't want to share no problem. The aim? To connect a bit better on a personal level. I find this connection important, especially for the newcomers.\n   - **team updates** (max 15mins per team including Q&A): what are you currently working on or what is coming up? What are you struggling with or what do you need help with? Please be as concise as possible.\nThe teams are: \n**community management** (@noemi / @MariaEuler / @johncoate) \n**outreach and engagement** (@nadia) \n**research** (@alberto / @amelia) \n**tech** (@matthias / @hugi)   \n**admin and coordination** (@marina)      \n   - ending the call with the summary of **action points** by the facilitator (max 5 mins).\n\n- notes are then posted under the agenda on the platform by the note taker and action points added on Todoist. \n\nMaybe this seems too structured right now, but I'm keen on trying it out. :) \n\nAlso, we are switching back to zoom to assure the quality of the call.

In the United States a 16 year old boy who couldn't afford braces just went ahead and<a href=\"http://amosdudley.com/weblog/Ortho\"> 3-d printed his own orthodontics</a>. In another part of the world a concerned parent got tired of the constant worrying about whether their diabetic four year old son's blood sugar levels are ok, so they <a href=\"www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/health/a-do-it-yourself-revolution-in-diabetes-care.html\">hacked the diabetes monitor's software code and wrote a simple program that transmitted the monitoring data to an online spreadsheet he could view on a Web browser or mobile phone</a>. Their actions are now part of an  entire open source ecosystem, from sensors to apps to insulin, emerging from patients. Many people living their dreams together are changing their corner of the world, one small intiative at a time.\n\n<strong>In this challenge we conduct research to discover what is already out there and what is needed by existing projects/places/products/services and the people they serve.</strong> In doing this collaboratively we increase our collective knowledge. We also encourage peers to acknowledge one another's good work and build on it, rather than waste resources duplicating or competing with existing initatives. The focus of our research efforts in the context of OpenCare are initiatives that exist at the intersections of care, communities and open science and technologies that allow anyone to make and modify the things they want...without needing permission.\n\n<strong>What do we mean by OpenCare?</strong> Seen from here the definition of Care is nurturing interactions between humans; the open part is about fluidity in the roles and relationships of the humans involved. Food cultures, cultural practices, the artefacts we use and the ways in which we use them etc; the field is broad and you are free to look in whatever direction that engages you.\n\n<strong>The Challenge: </strong>Produce case studies on existing initiatives, interventions, products, or services that are relevant to your care-related challenge or question.\n\n<strong>How to complete this challenge:</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Identify interesting or relevang Groups, Projects, Places, Products, Technologies, Tools, Services or Infrastructures.</li>\n\n<li>Interview their protagonists using this <a href=\"/t/interview-framework-for-case-studies-adventures/4429\">interview framework</a>. <em>We recommend you make an extra effort to capture each interview on video so you have footage that you can re-use/remix for later steps if you want (e.g. putting together crowdfunding campaigns).</em>\n</li>\n\n<li>Map the flow of information, reosurces, attention and trust in the ecosystem of which they are a part.</li>\n\n<li>Identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that either the project faces from its environment, or that the environment faces from the project.</li>\n\n<li>Present your results in a text with visual material..</li>\n\n<li>Upload your results using the \"add my story\" button below or email them to noemi@edgeryders.eu</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n \n\n<strong>What makes a good Case Study?

The project focuses on explaining and contextualising the recent rise of populism in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The community research is hosted on Edgeryders, an online community of 5000 people in more than 80 countries who share experiences. By sharing experiences with one another we turn our collective knowledge into useful advice to make better decisions for ourselves and our families in the near future. As a consequence of getting to know people from around the world, we connect one another to important information, new ideas and new opportunities.\n\nThe research analysis considers content collected through [edgeryders.eu](https://edgeryders.eu/), subject to online ethnographic analysis and semantic social network analysis.\n\nBeyond the research project, we are a community: We use the tools offered by this platform to help connect people with mutual interests, concerns and complimentary skills. The online conversation runs in parallel with events all over Europe to meet and share constructive approaches.

The choice is thus not about \u201cprivacy\u201d or \u201csecurity of devices\u201d, but about continuing to function as a society able to offer generic infrastructures to its citizens. The focus on identity is related. Why would there be so many contenders for providing identity (WIN, Sovrin, ID2020, Uport/IoTA, eIDAS...) if the system itself of the nation state was \u201cstable\u201d? After Over The Top players (OTT) on services, the next logical step we will witness is OTT on systemic identity itself. Against this scenario I prefer a further European integration after the euro, which was the first step towards peace in Europe, on the full stack of infrastructure as a commons of 500 million people. With this in mind I offer a positive narrative of emergent technologies that can build a supporting infrastructure offering tailored solutions to individuals and groups.\n\n*Picture the current situation: a table full of delicacies, linen as white as snow, beautiful cutlery; you\u2019ve invited your friends to dinner. Everyone is happy and deep in conversation. All realise, however, that nothing on that table is yours. You only (still) own the house in which you throw the party. GAFA: Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, and BAT: Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, play on that table and they get richer every minute from our very own feedback. They build new services on top of that. You realise that at some point soon they will take over your house. They already offer to pay the rent of the patio, and do you really need the attic? You are in an uphill battle. You have no tools to fight off the invaders as you are only now, when it is too late, beginning to realise these friends you have invited are taking reality itself, what is \u201cnormal\u201d to another level. And as the peasants learned how to tumble the knights from their horses, the world was never the same again.*\n\nhttps://www.theinternetofthings.eu/sites/default/files/docs/ECJ_vol5_issue2_Rob_van_Kranenburg.pdf", "created_at": "2019-11-09 08:32:34.983509", "updated_at": "2019-11-09 08:32:34.983509", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 396, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 62.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56565, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 9712, "post_number": 29, "raw": "I'm in!\nI'll be in Brussels on July 15, arriving downtown somewhere around 4pm -- in case we need to prepare anything.

Tags are used when many pieces of content should be listed in a section, for example in 'Featured work' or 'Events'. In these cases, the framework displays all posts with those tags. Note that the post does not have to be in this category, it can be anywhere on the platform. That goes for all content served to the website. As long as the tag or id is right, it will get to the right place.\n\nWe have also defined a few different styles of content, that are displayed slightly differently on the site.\n\nA handful of images and text strings are not fetched from Discourse, but coded directly into the website template. Those need to be changed in the code.\n\n# Frontpage \n\n### Header\nContent for the header is coded into the template, and must be updated in the code.\n\n### Intro paragraph\nContent comes from a single post on the platform, [available here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-culture-squad/9591).\n\n### About us\nTitle and content comes from a single post on the platform, [available here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/about-us/9592).\n\n### Events\nEvents are posts tagged with `webcontent-culturesquad-event`. In order for the event to be displayed correctly it must have:\n* A Discourse date tag on the first line of the post\n* An image on the second line of the post\n* A description below the image\n\nLong descriptions will be capped so the box doesn't stretch too far. Events also get their own page on the site, rendered with the same content, but which allow for a full description.\n\nTo add a new event to the page, simply make a new post with the tag `webcontent-culturesquad-event`. To remove an event from the site, just remove the tag. \n\n### Featured work\nTo add new featured work, add posts with the `webcontent-culturesquad-featured` tag.\nVery similar to events, but without the date tag. First row is an image, and the rest is description. Clicking on the headline takes you to the thread to join the conversation around that work. Again, remember that this post does not have to be in this category \u2013 in fact it is probably better that it is a post in the usual Culture Squad category.\n\n ### Featured content\n\nThis is a list of all posts with the `webcontent-culturesquad-post` tag.\n\n### Join us\nTitle and content comes from a single post on the platform, [available here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/join-us/9597/2).\n\n### Footer\nContent for the footer is coded into the template, and must be updated in the code.\n\n# Team page\n\n### Team site description\nTitle and content comes from a single post on the platform, [available here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/team-site-description/9603/2).\n\n### Team members\nTeam members are added by creating new posts with the tag `webcontent-culturesquad-member`. Title of the post is the name and the first row of the post should be the image.\n\n### Partners\nTitle and content comes from a single post on the platform, [available here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/team-site-partners/9604/2).", "created_at": "2019-04-03 12:58:45.718304", "updated_at": "2019-04-05 13:17:59.996607", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 576, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 132.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55312, "user_id": 5193, "topic_id": 10049, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Hej,\n\nTwoja historia jest bardzo w punkt.

And the conversation will be exploring Noah's visions and thoughts of a utopian internet, as well as some of Noah's history. We've been talking quite a bit ahead of time. And we recently got introduced each other. And it was kinda with a shebang and a lot of checkboxes. _\n\n_To give it a round about exploration of what you've explored previously, is it legal infrastructures mixed with AI and ethical complications that come thereof. And you've explored ethical hacking, and working with radically open security, as well as politicy, psychology, law, economics and programming and many more it seems like, and now you're entering a master's program at Oxford, in like, two weeks. Yeah. To start off, if we if we go about it from a chronological order, where would that lead us to start?_\n\n_Noah:  _\n_I'm Noah. And I think my journey started as a politically aware and interested human being quite young, I was 12 or so when I really somehow caught fire for a topic that now is actually all over the world and more in the headlines, but back then was not so much. And it's really just the question: how can we get to a world with hundred percent renewable energy as fast as possible. And that was my utopia, that that really inspired me and got me going. _\n\n_And I came from a small town in southern Germany, and I started to, travel to different places, protests and all these things. This got me in touch with research institutions, and political institutions. And then there came a second phase at some point, because I realized, well, somehow in the end, in all these discussions that I had with politicians and lobbyists and activists, in the end, you know, like, we can all discuss this, and how there's an ecological imperative how we need to change our world, due to the ecological boundaries of our world. But in the end, still, the economic argument wins somehow. It always does in the political arena, or tends to, and I was really frustrated by that. And so I was like, Well, if the economic argument wins, maybe I should learn better how it works. And I really got into business ethics, and asked: how can we reimagine how the economy and how businesses work, because to challenge that paradigm of that it's only about money making, and it's much more about human thriving and the common good. And these are the contributions that companies should aim for. _\n\n_So from there on, I realized what drives companies and what really shapes them, because companies can become really slow to develop there as well. The single force that right now is changing companies and the economy most is technology. And so if we get this one right, if we can get the technological change right, then that's also a really good opportunity to just change how our economy works, and how our society works for the better. So like technology is what's right now is the moving pieces that right now are shaping new things, and our generation has the opportunity to co-shape these technological changes. And I think that's opportunity I want to take so that we can use the technology together with our human insights and intuitions and values to make a more humane society and economy._\n\n_Zenna:  _\n_So I'm, I'm curious. Now, we've talked a little bit about this before about the technology being power. And we also talked about how Oxford was Hogwarts. And coders are the wizards up today. Framing it in that perspective, is an egalitarian world something worth fighting for? And if it is, what is technology and the knowledge thereof, what place does that have?_\n\n_Noah:  _\n_In generally I find egalitarian philosophy very appealing, particular, John Rawls' idea that first of all, freedoms should be equal, and everybody should have some basic civil liberties. And then when we look at material conditions, that to be very rough again, the different principle according to John Rawls is that an unequal division of resources is only legitimate, if it actually benefits those that are least well off. And I think, right now we're definitely at a point I would say, where we don't justify our current system is not justified by that, by that standard, in the sense that we use technology often not centered on the most vulnerable people in our communities and societies._\n\n_Also Silicon Valley culture, even if it purports to save the world, startups get bought up by venture capitalists, which then again are owned by the ones that already currently own the world. Self-feeding. Exactly. And again, I find it sad that all this beautiful technology that could be built into really meaningful things in the end, nobody says that all the social media companies we have now or all those giants needed to go to the direction they had to it was just that's the society in which technology arrived was one in which these kinds of innovations were immediately put under profit, maximizing pressure._\n\n_Zenna:  _\n_And copyright?_\n\n_Noah:  _\n_And copyrights is also one part of it. Yes, I could imagine very different ways of arriving there. But then again, I think my my philosophy that I developed around this is kind of really being willing to think, very radical, very big about how things could be different, but then really starting from where we are right now. So I really don't like just complaining about how things should be very different. I didn't like only like talking about business ethics, but I also got into social entrepreneurship and founded companies myself and tried to not just talk about how business should be run differently, but I tried to do it. And it's hard. _\n\n_Zenna:  _\n_just as a tidbit, what's goal that you found from your time in there, and I don't mean, goals as in capitalist values, but as in, what did you find that you brought with you on your new journey?_\n\n_Noah: _\n_I think generally, the, the methodologies of business can often be very useful if they are used to different ends. So like, basically, the idea of Muhammad Yunus is to find a social business, to use business means for social ends to solve real social problems, and not for the kind of problems they've been conventionally associated with. One more additional thought that helped me to develop my own philosophy that I call pragmatic idealism. At this point, I can summarize in three models: first, hope without critical thinking, is just naivety, but critical thinking without hope is just cynicism. And then the second idea is: confidence without humility, is just arrogance but then humility, without confidence, is sheepishness._\n\n_Zenna:  _\n_And that's your own personal philosophy for how you see yourself throughout the world?_\n\n_Noah:  _\n_More people that inspired us include Maria Popova, Bulgarian writer, but also many others. And then like the last sentence kind of is more like the synthesis of it all I would say, which is pragmatism without idealism is just opportunism. But idealism without pragmatism is just wishful thinking. So that's kind of my, that's my philosophy. That kind of is the goal, I would say, I found that pragmatism and idealism need to work together. Yeah, the, I think, especially like, the first two are probably more inspired by other people. Pragmatism and idealism, they live in the space between the two. And so really have ambitious goals, but also be really pragmatic, where you start with it._\n\n_Zenna: _\n_if we go back to the origin of the ambitious goals, so to speak, if you were to start sketching out the image of what those ambitious goals for, let's say, if you want to reshape the internet, plural, What would that look like for you?_\n\n_Noah:  _\n_I don't have one overarching one but I think I have several different utopian visions. I took an international relations course in my undergrad degree in Amsterdam in social sciences and I was thinking about, well, how does international relations in global politics fit into cyberspace that we increasingly live in, and the internet and, and just writing and trying to combine this global politics theories with these new technologies, and then I just for some reason, wrote these words like cyber peace and cyber war. And I just noticed that my computer for some enough reason underlined cyber peace as like an unknown word, but not CYBER WARS. I looked up in different word processing programs, none of the knew cyber peace, but all the knew cyber war. And so it was just like, Well, that's interesting, the vocabulary that we have in the conceptual space of the internet, is we conceptualize it as war, we don't even know how to talk about it in terms of peace, because we don't have a word for it. And just that obvious asymmetry that it somehow needs to be a very aggressive and violent place, apparently out there. And this is the language we use. That kind of made me think there's some utopia missing. When you look at what is cyber peace, maybe we look at peace in the real world first. There were always like ideas of world peace, they've always existed, but somehow we've not achieved it yet. So just one very common idea of world peace was developed by Immanual Kant, a philosopher, who in 1795 wrote an essay called 'perpetual peace', with the simple hypothesis that the states with a republican constitutions so democracies, should all just guarantee each other security. And when they do that, then we could have an ever expanding union of peace, because nobody would ever attempt to attack such a block of countries. And we could have an ever expanding unit of peace._\n\n_Zenna:_\n_One thing that's been discussed recently, especially in the realms of internet and internet infrastructures, is the issue of centralization. In that kind of utopian image of a block of peace, one can say a block of Empire, which would then set the frame for the rest of the world._\n\n_Noah _\n_Absolutely agree. Kant said we don't need a centralized contract or institution for this. We don't need a treaty for this, this would just emerge out of enlightenment, basically, enlightened actions of, of individuals and countries, again, 18th century philosophy maybe doesn't completely explain the internet. But I think there are some interesting things when you actually apply it. _\n\n_And again, because the internet is a very different beast. If you look at the long term trends, again, we have not achieved real peace. But overall, we live in a more peaceful world than ever before. And I think we should continue to have progress. Because right now, when we speak about the internet, we just speak a lot about, like, there's a lot of cybercrime and a cyber war between the countries and all that. And I think that what we really should aim for is really to have this this utopian vision and how I think that can actually happen in cyberspace, much more than in real world, think cyberspace is actually could be a much more peaceful place, then the world we live in physically. And that is because of the different dynamics of security in the cyberspace. It's very asymmetric. And it's very different from other security, thinking of like 20th century Cold War thinking, which often has been the only dominant security paradigm has been applied to the internet, because the common story is that on the internet you you don't know who's your attacker. Basically, it's very difficult to do attribution of attackers. So you just want to develop your own offensive capability and hack everyone. The superpowers that are emerging, are basically trying to copy this old patterns into this new world. First of all, I don't think that's how it's going to work out. And second of all, I don't think it's desirable, and it doesn't work that way. And that's because because of this asymmetry in the internet, that you don't know who your attacker, attribution is very difficult. So you can't retaliate, even if you have offensive capabilities, right? The offensive capability you have is not a deterrence against somebody else's attack, which in the physical world is very different. If you have a nuclear bomb, you know, the other person is not going to bomb you because you can bomb them back. This logic of the Cold War in that sense doesn't work anymore in the internet. A second reason for that is basically you can destroy somebody else's offensive capability by building up your own defenses. So if you do really good, actually security for yourself, and if you do security research, and you find vulnerabilities and you find zero days, then you can basically destroy the offensive capabilities of others because they rely on these vulnerabilities. And so, you know, if I have a nuclear bomb, just because you build some protection doesn't mean I don't have a nuclear bomb. But if I have a zero day, which is basically an exploit to which there is no fixes yet, and you close that, that gap, that I don't have a bomb anymore, I don't have a weapon anymore. So basically, you can take away somebody else's offensive capability by building good defenses. I think these dynamics have not been fully understood by policymakers._\n\n_Zenna:  _\n_Is that something you would call sign of peace? You can build up defenses and by having a safety rather than offensive?_\n\n_Noah: _\n_Yeah, I don't think security must always be so state-centric, my vision for cyberpeace is that, basically everybody in a certain union, and it doesn't have to be a contractual union, which works towards building collective defenses. A global norm for zero day reporting, that countries that join and when they report zero days they never improve not only their security, but security of everybody else. And again, like many people might say that sounds so super idealistic. And I don't think it is, I think there are very pragmatic reasons to do so. Because if you're part of this defensive union, then you will be much safer than if you're if you don't share any of you zero days, and you twist try to get keep and build your own offensive capabilities for all the reasons that I've named, because on offensive capabilities can be destroyed by enemies, and because of having offensive capability is not a deterrent against attacks._\n\n_Zenna:  _\n_So if you have a union, there must also be an 'them' outside of it? Is that what you imagine, for a utopian internet?_\n\n_Noah:  _\n_Generally, I would apply this kind of Kantian idea that in the end, we want to live on a peaceful planet or in a peaceful cyberspace. My vision is that we, in the end have a safe space in the internet and we start by creating small safe spaces, and they start expanding until in the end, hopefully they cover everything. There will always be cyber attacks. But we can minimize the impact and increase the integrity of our of everybody's experience in the internet by for example, having a global norm for zero day reporting. And I find what I like about the global norm for zero day reporting is it encourages everyone to contribute to everyone's security, because you can't just close the zero day vulnerability for yourself, you do it for everyone. And at the same time, the only 'them' that basically you create is the people that don't want to work together to make everyone's experience safer. And the 'them' is basically the people that want to keep the exploits to themselves. Only the people that kind of want to be able to really attack other people systems are then kind of that that will be against. I do not have a very clear institutional setup how this would work, because obviously, it's very difficult to control these kind of things. So I don't it's not fully developed. But my point is more this narrative shift from we talked about a place where there's a lot of war happening, cyber war, to a place where cyber peace is possible, and where we should make sense of peace, not cyber war._\n\n_Zenna: _\n_Whose responsibility is it to make this shift happen?_\n\n_Noah: _\n_I think in the end, it's everyone's, but I think, if I should put my hope on, for example, individual institutions, I think institutions that are very well set to do this, or where I have realistic hope for this is the European Union. So if the European Union were to start such a project, where it said, okay, we, as a group of countries decided we want to start a norm, that what everyone ought to report zero days, because it's better for everyone to do that. I think that could be very powerful. And I know that the current administration, for example, in the US, which obviously controls the most powerful capability there, is not going to willing to do that. But I hope that that could change given also the large trajectory of history, I hope that it is possible. Also for other countries, I hope that they that in the same way that we didn't think it seemed impossible to ever start a counter proliferation movement in the nuclear age. And it seemed that we will for eternity, always just create more bombs to kill each other. We now actually live a world where there's still too many bombs, but at least less than 50 years ago. And in the same way, I have a hope that in 50 years, I know it's a long shot and it's not going to happen overnight. And right now, all the talks on the UN level are basically non-existent on this topic. So it's I really hope that we could live in a world where we have less, not more attacks and more integrity of everybody's devices._\n\n_Zenna: _\n_You've been working a bit with AI and machine learning, and specifically on the focus of whether it's ethical, if placed in a legal system. Do you want to expand on that?_\n\n_Noah:  _\n_Yeah, of course. So I think kind of like that was my work that I started, or did two years ago that I  talked about this narrative shift to cyber peace. And what I didn't like about it is that it was apart from that it was state centric, and that there were many practical problems with it and very long shot, it was still defensive, it was still like it's talking about my utopia is security or safety, which is still something like the absence of violence. That's the problem with peace. Also, you know, it's not medicine super positive, it's only that bad things are not there. And so I was like, I want something more positive than that. And and that's then where I got also more into this AI space. And because I think they're really there is opportunity to positively shape human thriving in many ways. And to unlock this potential that we need to avoid many risks that are often also discussed and that are very real. And the as I said, also, I wonder, and they I feel I don't have this super clean utopia, because somehow every utopia that involves machines that can do more than we do, in some sense, apparently ends up being a dystopia sometimes. And so we have to still do a lot of work on which utopia, we actually want out there._\n\n_Zenna: _\n_ In your utopia, does AI exist?_\n\n_Noah: _\n_I'm a pragmatic idealist. So my somehow my ideals are also based on my pragmatism. And I think there is not a world possible where we get rid of AI. I don't know if you heard about the unabomber, who's like a, like a guy who started basically bombing scientists, because he believed that the progress of science and technology would destroy human society. And given that I don't think that's a viable path that we will have, that we will basically live with less technology, then the question is, how can we shape the current trends and the current technologies that are rising to human benefit? And also maybe sometimes also, how can we consciously decide not to use them?_\n\n_But overall, I'm convinced that we will get machines that will be better than humans at many tasks that currently only humans can do. Given that that's going to come, the question is, how do we want to do that? I think their biggest problem are, exactly about human centrism. So how can we make sure that they align with our values. Like that's a long term perspective, I would say all this question, which is kind of like AI governance questions that says when, for example, pioneered by Nick Bostrom, the whole ideas of what do we do when general AI actually is smarter than humans? I think these are super valuable questions to research. _\n\n_But then there's also the short term questions, and that's what we're after dealing with these important questions of, if we already today have for example, a system that makes legal decisions, for example, in an administration and that public administration, what laws do we want to be imbued into that? Do we think it's just fine if there's some human mandate and humans and some democratically elected institution decides now we want this to be done by an AI? Or do we also think there needs to be some outputs that need to be in some material sense fair, as it just if it's if it's cheaper and faster do we just accept it? Or do we also want to actually be able to understand the process to be accessible for humans, because then many advanced machine learning programs, currently, they're black boxes for us, so we can't really understand them. _\n\n_And the other question is, well, if it's trained on any human data, human centric data, also in that sense, then it's going to take human vices with it, and it could even aggregate them and exaggerate them. And so yeah, there's a lot of open questions, and I don't really have full answers to those yet. But my utopia is just I can only explain it in very abstract terms at this point, because there's a lot of research and thinking and testing and acting to be done on this field. But right now, it's to reap the benefits to avoid the risks, and to make sure that we humanize the technology that we live with, in the sense that in the sense that we really challenge also what it means to be human for ourselves, because I don't think we know right now what it means to be human. And if we first figure out like, or if we figure out what it means to be human, then we can also tell when we want technology to do to help us to thrive._\n\n_Zenna: _\n_Thank you so much for forth your thoughts. I'm that feeling that we will hear more from you._\n\n_Noah: _\n_Well, thank you very much for giving me this space.

Format\n\nThe format decision is difficult. If we want this thing to be accessible and financially sustainable (we do), we need many people to be able to access it. But if we want it to go deep (we do) we need some way to make sure it does not become a funfair. \n\nSo, our skeletal format is this:\n\n* **At least two \"big picture\" lectures**. Each lecture will explore a big vision for a possible alternative economy, as proposed by one author. It will feature one or more discussants, who might be economists or social scientists, but also entrepreneurs who are themselves experimenting with alternative economic models. These should last a good 2-3 hours each.\n* **A number of seminars** in which we go deep into side topics. Examples of seminar topics: (a) does reputation scoring build trust or does it incentivize participants to game the system? (b) the economics and technology of artificial scarcity (c) what we really know on universal basic income.  The list could go on forever. We could have a call for talks, or something like that. \n* **A dinner, or a party, or both**. \n* **Great documentation (an ethnography of utopia**. We (Edgeryders) are quite experiences at good documentation of live events. We will make it great this time, and throw in an ethnography and semantic social network analysis. \n\n\n## 2. Tentative date\n\nFebruary 2019?\n\n\n## 3. Partnerships \n\nWe agreed we would love this thing to be in Brussels, as a way to give back to the city. Turns out there are quite a few festivals, events, organizations, even institutions we could partner up with, both in the city and in the rest of Belgium. We scout them out in the next few weeks.\n\n\n## 4. Crowdfunding \n\nA crowdfunding campaign is a great way to get the word out, as well as collect money for travel and fees for the speakers. We are inclined  to do one. \n\n\n## 5. Reading group\n\nIn the run-up to the event, we will run a reading group. It will have physical meetings (every 2-4 weeks), but also an online life here on the platform.\n\n\n## 6. \"A platform\" \n\nWe are happy for people to build on top of this. Publications? Games? Film screenings? In general, we will treat the event as an open source project, and people will build what they build. However, we will make a commitment to building a kernel (see \"Format\" above, though we are not completely clear on the format yet), whatever other might or might not do.\n\n\n## 7. What's next\n\n1. **Make a screening of Econ SF work**. We build a small bibliography of the relevant books. We also better start to think of economists, sociologists and other intellectuals (or practitioners) that might act at discussants. This happens directly on the platform: reply to this topic or start one of your own. This doubles up as a list of material for the reading group. The reading group's host will, initially, be @anique.yael.\n\n2. **Make a screening of Brussels-, Belgium- and Planet Earth- based organizations that might be interested in partnering up with us**. We will then invite everyone over for coffee, or talk to them one-on-one. The people best suited to do this in today's meeting are @mariekebelle, @ireinga and @yannick. Again, let's use the platform. Don't worry too much where you put stuff initially, the platform is optimized to make it easy to reorganize content.\n\n3. **Think of a name**. \"Econ-SF seminar\" is not great. Again, you can suggest one in this very thread.\n\n4. **Build the core group**. We need volunteers!

This fragilizes your website, because now more websites have to keep working (and update their certificates etc.) for your own website to display correctly.\n\n* And do *not* write text directly in the configuration files. If you do this, you lose the automatic updating feature. Now you will have to make updates manually, tediously editing the XML file. \n\n## Choose and structure a home for your content\n\nMake sure the materials for your website remain easy to find, for yourself and others. Currently, I (@alberto) am using this method:\n\n* Make a subcat `Web content` in the top-level cat that the website refers to. So, for example, #research-network:web-content within #research-network. Note that the category containing your content must be public, or the webkit will be unable to display it.\n* Within that subcat, start by creating an empty topic that will be the home of your configuration file. Give it an explanatory title, for example \"Website of the collaborative ethnography webinar series \u2013 configuration file\". \n* Create a reply to that topic, and upload to it the logos and pictures that you need. Web designers call this \"the assets\" ([example](/t/13865/2)). \n* Within that same subcat, create topics and posts as needed for \"static\" text blocks (for example, the \"about\" section). Remember to use titles that help \"future you\" to find what you are looking for, when you or a colleague want to change the website a year from now. You can create a topic for each content block: in the example [here](/t/13969) these will be called \"About\", \"Methodology\", etc.  Alternatively, you can create a single topic, using different reply posts for different static texts. The webkit can handle both methods.\n\n## Make or choose high-quality content\n\nWebsites are longer-lived than forum topics. Better get them right. \n\nFor static text: \n\n* Be brief and snappy. No rambling about. Short sentences. Avoid adverbs and passive forms as much as possible. I like to write these texts with the [Hemingway Editor.](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/).\n* Be confident (but not arrogant). Edgeryders no longer needs to prove its worth, so you don't need to put a whole list of publications to prove the point that we authored several publication. We just write \"we authored several high-quality publications\", and people will believe it. \n\nFor static images and videos: \n* Make sure that logos files are available in an acceptable definition. \n* Choose nice pictures and videos. \n* Make sure you have the legal right to use the pictures; find out the license they have been published under, and respect to the letter its terms.

And sure, the welfare state is a major safety net in their societies. \"Business is the main care provider\", reply many Americans. They have a point too: their insurance companies, hospitals and clinic \u2013 most of these are businesses.\u00a0\n\nAnd yet, that's not the whole story. Care models are failing: per capita health care expenditure grows faster than GDP. We need to spend an ever-greater part of our resources just to stay well.\u00a0\n\nUnder pressure to get care, the edges of society (the young, the nomads and migrants, the precariat) respond by getting creative.

Hundreds of enterprising Greeks spawn a whole network of \"shadow\" clinics [https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care ]. Three expat adult couples in Belgium decide to live under the same roof and be each other's support network [link to https://edgeryders.eu/en/living-social-in-brussels-co-living-as-a-lifestyle-for-grown-ups ]. Along this journey, they (and we all) face deep questions about what care really is. Is it services? Is it human attention and warmth? Is it trying to fix what's wrong with people in need of care? Is it accepting everybody for what they are, with their strengths and weaknesses?\n\nWe are collecting stories of care. We hope to get to a shared view of what people are doing to cope when official systems fail. Do you have one such story? Please, share it with us.

Also, I have the full e-version of a handbook of psychological anthropology, written by one of my favourite teachers at Columbia, Chuck Lindholm, *Culture and Identity. The History, Theory and Practice of Psychological Anthropology*. I will gladly share, should you be interested. I take the diagram below (Plutchik\u2019s wheel) from that book (2007:275)\n\n![Screen Shot 2020-07-03 at 3.21.50 PM|690x636](upload://j1IrcoO24vGibMzTn5GsbOFIqif.png) \n\nSee also: https://positivepsychology.com/emotion-wheel/ (and another version of this diagram below):\n\n![Screen Shot 2020-07-03 at 4.17.19 PM|690x686](upload://4jF1GUenJrMgRaQi7JwW76mtEdm.png) \n\nSummary of the section on emotions (Lindholm 2007:291)\n\nEmotions are, as any number of theorists have noted, extremely difficult to study. Compelling, ambiguous, and subjective, they have served in the West as the epitome of the irrational. But they are also perhaps the most powerful motivating factors in our lives, and so have been the object of intellectual discourse for a very long time indeed. Many theories of emotion have been proposed, some of them concerned primarily with evaluation, others with typology. Emotions have also been the object of rational control, and have been apostrophized as the seat of true humanity. They have been seen as internally generated and as completely reflective of context.\n\n*Despite controversy, it is now recognized that emotions do have distinctive and universal physiological content, that they serve as a biological system of motivation. It is also recognized that some emotions are fundamental and powerful, while others are peripheral and less gripping. But exactly what these fundamental emotions are remains controversial, though there seems to be general agreement that fear, anger, sadness, and happiness ought to be included (emphasis - JK).*\n\nSome anthropologists have been slow to accept these findings and have tended instead to argue that emotions are completely culturally constructed. The Balinese, for example, have been said to have no feelings at all, while the Inuit feel no anger and the Ilongot can throw anger away. Yet restudies have discovered that these are overstatements that do not do justice to the complexity of the emotional experience of these peoples. *It is clear, though, that emotion is regulated differently in various cultures, with some strongly favoring masking or even simulating emotions for pragmatic purposes, while others alter their expression of feeling in the belief that this will change their inner reality. These differences are related to differences in social structure: Tight yet competitive structures where people have a known status and role are more likely to manipulate or mask feeling; looser and more ambiguous systems lead members to define themselves through the public expression of appropriate emotional states*.\n\nBut if different societies have different concepts of emotion, does this mean that feelings themselves differ? Many anthropologists now argue that some cultures do not see emotion in Western fashion as internal, personal, and powerful. Instead, for them, emotion is public, relational, and controllable\u2014an embodied form of thought. However, there are contradictions in this argument\u2014not the least of which is the difficulty of accounting for the motivations of others in ways that do not simply reduce all interactions to quests for power. *Also, conflating thought with emotion has the unintended consequence of reducing the autonomy of emotion. Feeling becomes another mode of discourse and thus all but disappears*.\n\n*What is needed instead is a more dialectical view of emotion and culture as realms of being that are intertwined and mutually interrelated, but do not wholly overlap. Some emotions may be hypercognized, others may be hardly spoken of at all, yet the latter do not vanish and may appear in symbolic or somatic forms. Certainly, culturally specific emotional forms do indeed exist, as blends or as modifications of deeper drives*. Nonetheless, for the anthropological study of emotion to go forward, it must be admitted that all human beings share a common heritage. To argue that fundamental emotional impulses exist and are engaged in a dialectic with cultural constraints does not undermine anthropological analysis. Instead, this premise provides a better basis for comparative work and, perhaps more importantly, gives a basis for the humane anthropological claim that others are not so different from ourselves. They too are driven by contradictory desires for attachment and for autonomy; they too are subject to fears, anxieties, and grief; they too are transported by love and communion.", "created_at": "2020-07-04 16:28:35.823341", "updated_at": "2020-07-04 16:34:15.869135", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1030, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66091, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10674, "post_number": 54, "raw": "[quote=\"ralu, post:46, topic:10674\"]\nRefering to the 3rd workshop, @noemi and I tried a paid Tweets strategy to get more people to subscribe.

Very important in how it's introduced and explained. @euge facilitated an excellent warm up journey here through his presentation.\n\nThe safe space and authenticity that emerged allowed me more than ever to suspend any prejudgement, biases, stereotypes and just listen and absorb insights. It was extremely effective at soliciting a wide range of experiences.\n\nI'm interested to explore ways to make the discussion outcomes more effective and actionable.\n\nI'm overall optimistic about this type of collaboration. I especially observe how even when fostering these types of emergent co-creative, collaborative sessions, good facilitation is crucial to guiding the 'co-facilitation'.\n\nThere is more to build upon here. How can we turn these insights into actions? Should that have been part of the design of the collaborathon or should that be a natural emergent outcome?\n\n---\n\n> What is *contribution* in a changing world.\n...from the perspective of: Family, Economy, Spirituality, Ecology, Culture, etc) \n\n...It's really how we choose to define, and re-define them. It's a reflection of our values and how we choose to manifest them, through our participatory co-design of our joint experiences daily.\n\n---\n\n*Some notes on..*\n\n* **Culture & Ecology** \n I'm so curious here as to how we can continue to respect cultural traditions, but be empowered to update and modify some parts of rituals, practices and identities to closer align with our beliefs. To bring back old rituals that give us empathy for the earth, closeness to our community. To share and borrow from other cultures that might do parts of this better, respecting their origins but embracing our shared future. \n\n   A friend @M_PF once told me about a ritual involving the planting of a tree for a birth, and then when that person is married, the tree is cut down and used to furnish their home. Whether for practical purposes, or just as a earth-bonding experience, this practice seems beautiful to me. \n\n  Imagine growing old with your tree sibling, experiencing it change shape and weather storms as you do. \n\n  More like this!\n\n---\n> We are our context, our context is our first contribution.\n---\n\n*Where does it go from here?*\n\nI recently heard @ela prompt us to consider and re-imagine what types of organisations we want to see in the future, this weekend I had that thought expanded to what types of collaborative environments do we want to see in the future. This weekend was an interesting experiment towards that.\n\nMeeting people's authentic selves in these spaces was invaluable. Starting from spaces to be and enquire rather than forcing specific objectives, does feel nourishing and a good starting step. Though it feels like one step of many.\n\nI'm curious to explore and collaborate on the design of light-touch (not heavy handed, humanity debasing) technology can help us organise in this manner. e.g. @hugi introduced me to the 'Dreams' and 'Reality' Edgeryders organisational tools.\n\nI'm also super curious about this notion of win-win games, the best examples of these for me so far are games that prompt and invite vulnerability and get us knowing each other and our selves by talking about interesting aspects of the human experience that we don't always talk about, stepping outside of our usual conversational loops (e.g. School of Life question cards, Authentic Relating sentence stems) \n\nSomeone mentioned about how existing competitive games like ping-pong can be changed so that instead of trying to bat the ball past the other person you can bat the ball to the other person and with a simple twist make the game a co-operative rather than a competition. Can we make these simple twists to the bigger games we place in our lives?", "created_at": "2019-11-24 19:27:18.325186", "updated_at": "2019-11-24 20:18:58.321931", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 680, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 76.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 4265], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59363, "user_id": 5201, "topic_id": 10674, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Ok, I submitted the test.

Our guests of honour here from DE Lab in Poland, Kristof Gyodi and Michal Palinski will begin with a presentation of their findings. They will take over the screen for about 20 minutes. Then a robust discussion should get going. I'm John from EdgeRyders and Louis from Nesta. We are the hosts of this meeting. Maria is going to be looking after the chat part. I will facilitate the discussion which probably won't take a lot of work, and we know that the chat is an important component of the discussion. Sometimes important things get entered into the chat when a lot of people are talking so if you have an important point you want to bring up and you can't find a way to work your way into the conversation, you can put it in the chat and we will try to bring it onto the table for everybody. So with that, I think we're ready to go. I want to also remind everybody that we are recording this and that you have agreed to it. Alright, without further ado, let's go now forward to the presentation from DE Lab.\n\n**Michal:**  \nThank you, John, for that introduction. My name is Michal Palinski, and together with Kristof Gyodi will try to present you today's topic that is social challenges brought by COVID-19. We have both analysis from the study economic lab at University of Warsaw and PhD candidates at Faculty of Economic Sciences also at the University of Warsaw, so we work mainly in a project that is called NGI Forward. Maybe you heard about it. It's a project brought by European Commission to identify the main technologies and interrelated social issues in relation to the internet and our role at the D lab is to bring numerous analyses, data science analysis involved in machine learning, web scraping and natural language processing to this topic.  One leg of this project is to provide analysis related to COVID-19 pandemic. And we tried to combine numerous methodologies we use day to day in our NGI Forward project to this challenge, and we would like to show you some of the results. Okay, I will share my screen now, so that you can see our website. If you didn't see the invitation then the address is https://covid.delabapps.eu/. There you can find our results, our visualizations.\n\n I will introduce our main idea.  We wanted to analyze four main areas. That is news about recent technologies: Social media. We chose Reddit because of its popularity. When it comes to open source we chose GitHub Repositories. And we also analyzed scientific papers, mainly Social Science Research Network, and data sets that are openly available. When it comes to news about COVID-19, we have analyzed around I think it was finally 11 news outlets in English that covers technology and wanted to see what are the technological angles with this recent pandemic.  \n\nWe have identified some growing trends. Here you can see these bubbles that represent keywords we have identified using some basic linear regression analysis, and we have divided these keywords into two main groups. The first one you can see clusters of keywords that are related solid to this pandemic, in the second bubble, you can see some of the keywords related to technologies. So the bigger the bubble is, the more robust the trend is of the selected keyword. So for example, you can see that in the recent months, such issues as social distancing, or short term rental, Air BnB or the issues related to unemployment are getting traction, you can think about some keywords that you can find interesting right now, and we can check them in Python and see whether they are growing or not. And recently, is the same with technologies, we can see what types of technologies are getting traction recently, so you can comment in the chat and we can check whether they are trending or not. So this is the first bit of our analysis, the most high level let's say.  Maybe I will mention that our analysis is semi-automatic, so we use many automated tools. But also some experts analysis was involved as in the case of this of these bubbles because we have used this as a regression to identify trends. And then with Kristof, we have clustered these keywords into these nice bubbles.\n\n**Kristof:**  \nYeah. And following this identification of main words, we were interested in to dive deeper into these news stories. So what we did next was that we analyzed the sentiment of the text. So if sentiment analysis, you can tell if the text is rather positive, negative, or maybe in between in sentiment. So now we'll draw based on the words of the text. So what we did was that we select some of the interesting news stories that are maybe more controversial, such as news stories related to contact tracing or news stories related to Zoom. And we did two things. First, we examine which are the words are frequently mentioned together, for example, with Zoom. So we identified all of the paragraphs that contain the word Zoom and examine, which are the words that are also frequently in these paragraphs. \n\nThe second thing was that we calculated the sentiment of these paragraphs and rank these word combinations based on the sentiment. So this way we were able to see first, which are the frequent combinations, and second, which are the positive and which are the negative relationships. So we had all the stories of some of these controversial views. So as an example, in the case of Zoom, the big dab that's those paragraphs that covered on the technology itself, on this video conferencing aspect on the different use case, it is rather positive. On the other hand, there were recently lots of sketchy stories about uninvited guests. So that's why we have also this password for this meeting. So different pranksters There's show up and violate meetings. And actually, this is also featured in the news about Zoom. And we calculated the sentiment and it was negative or in this neutral zone. So we prepared similar news stories related to contact tracing as well. So you can see which are the positive sides of this technology. And also, which are the negative issues such as privacy, the use of location data, and similar issues. Also, we identified, which are relevant actors, and so on. So this kind of tool has been very useful for us to quickly map out the main angles of a new story. \n\nThe second thing that we want to highlight is related to the matter of articles. And here we use a different machine learning tool and define that an algorithm called C SME has been very useful in this type of analysis. So our idea was to prepare a map, where articles that cover the same topic are in close vicinity to each other. So neighbouring points should report on the same news story. And here this location of the point is determined by this algorithm for colour, it was used another algorithm called topic modelling. And this is a different methodology. But in theory, we should have points that are on the same colour and should focus on the same topic. And on the other hand, points that are close to each other should be reporting on the same news or something related to each other. And basically, that's what the map is showing us. So now Michal is showing, for example, the dots in the northern section. These are the news stories on Zoom. So all the points are reporting here on Zoom, whether it is something positive or negative. We also picked out interesting clusters such as new stories about contact tracing, so now Michal is showing you this area of the map where you have reporting of the different initiatives, different national projects, also some concerns related to this technology. And we also found some other clusters related to companies. So for example, this is related to Facebook. In the southern section, we identify the news on Amazon. And again, these are the new studies related to COVID-19. So it enabled us to have a quick visual background of all the major topics and news reporting on recent developments.\n\n**Michal:**  \nOkay, so another area we have analyzed was social media. Here we wander to each social media to choose whether to Twitter Facebook. Finally, we have chosen Reddit data we have analyzed both comments and also on Reddit because of its popularity among tech enthusiasts. Here using Reddit data, we can also analyze certain keywords have chosen some sub-areas related to the job market mental health your app that is used in remote work and communication. We have analyzed trends of these keywords. Here, for example, you can see trends of comments and posts that cover a topic of face masks. And so major restriction around the word for it now. As you can see, in this graph, there is an exponential growth of comments about this topic. And this will be a case with many of our graphs. So exponential growth is not only related to infections, but it's also visible in social data. Here you can see how this issue of wearing a face mask was growing in popularity on Reddit in the recent month, the peak was at the beginning of April. Of course, you can then do this analysis on a more granular level. So you can see in which countries The discussion was most present. We also tried to map this issue in a timeline. We should update it because most of you know in Poland, we don't need to wear masks in public right now only in the rooms and buildings. Another area we wanted to cover was a threat to mental health. Because of the isolation, it was a very contentious issue. And we hypothesised that there will be a growing activity in subreddits that are related to such issues as anxiety, depression or suicide watch, and it was actually the case at least with the anxiety. As you can see that in the graph the number of comments in subreddit anxiety was skyrocketing at the beginning of March, which is really troublesome and it might be a good tool for policy. For example, interest monitor public attitudes towards Isolation quarantined and restrictions.\n\n**Kristof:**  \nAnd the other aspect of COVID-19 is the economic impact. And so we were also interested in to see if we can track any activity on Reddit related to the change of the economy. And you can see that the discussion around, for example, unemployment really skyrocketed. So there was a huge influx of comments that were covering unemployment from less than 1000 a day to almost 10,000. And so it suggests that there was a growing tension. We also know now from macro data that in fact, there's a really high share of people losing their jobs across the world. So in the case of the labour market graph, it is containing the number of commands that contain unemployed or unemployment. In the case of automation. They also were interested in to see there is a more lively discussion around automation tools, I guess, a risk that it would be also a long term solution to some of the recent problems in supply chains, in problems related to the pandemic. And you can see on the graph that from mid-March, there was increased activity on Reddit relates to automation robots and such words. The other thing that we did was we identified or examined, which are the subreddits that have been more activities related to discussions on unemployment. And on this graph, you can see the name of the subreddits and this gives us some ideas about the discussions. So on the one hand, you have stuff related to the economy, such as the small business subreddit, or legal advice. You have also this personnel aspect that is happening such as subreddits on personal finance, \"off my chest.\" Also, the mental health side that is now very important, maybe a bit neglected part of COVID-19, and so on. So this graph summarizes all the side of the challenge that is happening on the labour markets.\n\n**Michal:**  \nAnother wanted to see the competition among these remote work apps. And here we can see some interesting trends. For example, Skype experienced a surge in comments on Reddit. So probably it was the tool of the first choice. And then you can see this decreasing trend does a different story with such tools as discord, or even zoom, which plateaued after a while but it didn't experience a huge downward trend. Although Kristof mentioned some problems with zoom right, but it didn't affect at least popularity on Reddit. \n\nWhat we thought might be interesting from the policymakers' perspective was word comments about lockdown and lockdown easing lockdown protests also. Wanted to see whether communities on Reddit are commenting about this issue. And we thought it might be a nice tool to monitor the public sentiment about lockdown in quarantine. For example, anti-lockdown protests increased. There was a search in the middle of April, probably related to the situation in the US. As you know, there was quite a contentious issue there. And is recently it's even more right. You can see that lockdown easing experienced this huge growth from the middle of March. We can see it in the Reddit data. So one thing is this activity in the social media but another thing is this actual sentiment because we can speak about lockdown easing but what is your opinion about it, right? So we have applied sentiment analysis, this increase I have explained to you in the beginning. And this is just the beginning of our analysis. But we can see that after an initial negative sentiment, this is the mean sentiment, let's remember that.  But the sentiment at the beginning about lockdown was pretty negative and in the next month of April and May, it is more and more positive. How you can interpret those values? So the scale is from minus one to plus one, where minus one is really, really negative. And the last one is super excited. We usually say that when sentiment is around point two, it is meant to be quite positive. So right now this lockdown party so the comments about lockdown are in the neutral or slightly positive area. What we want to examine in the future is to see what is the distribution of the sentiments? Because right now, it's just a mean. But we will be happy to hear your ideas, how we can make some deep dives into it to examine what are the changes in perception of lockdown. \n\n**Kristof:**  \nThe final section. Well, we want to dive a bit deeper. Now if your is related to open source projects, there are projects on GitHub. And the thing that we did first was that we collected the metadata for all the projects that mention COVID-19 in their title or the project description, and we identified the projects and also the location of the developer who prepared the project. And they certainly are able to track the number of projects geographically and also dynamically over time how the number of projects evolved. So if you run the video, then you can see The 15 most important countries on GitHub in this COVID-19 project section, and you can see some interesting things happening. So naturally, in the US and in Europe, we have a great amount of projects, also in India, and in South America. So basically, it's all around the world. But you have these countries where you have quite a lot of open-source activity going on. And the other thing that is interesting is China because this was the epicentre of the pandemic, already there were projects early on from China in the first week, the time period that we are tracking.  However, at some point, the rest of the world, really to cap the number of projects and China remain that relatively low number of projects. So this is an interesting question, how come that the number of projects remains relatively low in China? We don't have a specific answer to this because we are more interested in at this point, to map out the data and see what's going on. So we don't really know the answers to the why's. But it can be interesting to observe how the societies work, and what is the role of the state, across the world. So it can be that in China, maybe it is not the best idea to have this kind of individual approaches to have a say in very important social issues. Maybe the state is taking a stronger stance in these kinds of things where location data and technology is involved. On the other hand, we have Europe where we have a less efficient state, taking your fight against Coronavirus. And also there's much greater opportunity for individuals to put together these kinds of projects and just release them to the world. And related to this, we also have some interesting stories. For example, the number of new projects that are released every day.\n\n**Michal:**  \nSo again, you can see another exponential growth here. But this initial rush is slowing down in recent weeks. And we wonder what is going on? Was it just a phase and after this initial rush, the activity is slowing down. And what we want to examine right now is whether the activity in this repositories is still going on or not. But you can see that there are still, at the beginning of May, there were still around 400 repositories a day created at GitHub, GitHub alone, but you still have Git Lab and other repositories. So in my opinion, it's unprecedented. I haven't done an analysis of GitHub in a large area, but it seems that this is an unprecedented issue. \n\nWe have analyzed what are the keywords in the introductions of these repositories. And what's interesting is that you can see that mostly they are aimed at visualizing this epidemic and creating apps. I thought that there will be more mortals that are aiming at explaining forecasting the number of infections and, and the victims of this pandemic. But it seems that communities mostly focused on creating dashboards and web visualizing tools. You can see also what are the main languages used in this project. This distribution is a bit different than in case of overall GitHub as we have checked, so there is more of Jupiter's. So it seems that people are creating some data science projects that can be easily transferred to other users. \n\nWe have also checked what are the most popular repositories. So here you can see the So table which ranks repositories related to COVID-19 on GitHub, which has the biggest number of forks, and watchers and so on. And it's not surprising that in the first place, there is this repository by Johns Hopkins University, which is one of the main sources around the world, providing a number of infected people and deaths from COVID-19. But you can see some interesting examples here. For example, number seven is 2019, and COVID memory, which is no longer on GitHub. This is the case Kristof told you earlier. So this is the suppository from Wuhan, which covered stories, memories of 100 residents related to COVID-19 and was censored.  And the creator of this repository is in jail right now in China and it's no longer available. It was available when we scraped the data. But right now, you will see just this website with input that it's no longer available. And in the beginning, we were surprised because we didn't know the story, the background story. And then we read all these articles about the censoring, censoring open source projects in China. So it's an interesting case where you first see something in data and then you read the newspapers. But as John mentioned in the beginning, there is such a flood of information about this issue that you've got to streamline it in a bit.\n\n**Kristof:** \nYeah, so that's maybe these were the most relevant before the research. We have also other graphs or even other data sources because we also need at the answer some graphs about research papers, also geographical analysis is related to research. You can also find some of the codes for our tours, how the research can be replicated and also some tutorials related to using the code. So if you are interested in data science and you have relatively basic programming skills, then using our tutorials, you will be able to read about the different functions, and also fire up the cords yourself and check for different words, topics and so on. So this was the introduction to our research. And now we are very happy to answer the questions. I see that the chat has been quite active.\n\nHost:  \nThank you very much. First questions were just simply: did you pick your keywords based on frequency count?\n\nKristof:  \nSo at the beginning where we had this visualization with the bubbles than what we did was, we calculated an average value for frequencies. So what is the average time per two years per article and we did an average Across all the sources for different periods of time, and this was the basis for identifying well, which are the words that are gaining traction that is more and more frequently are used. So yes, that was related to frequency.\n\n**Michal:**  \nYou can see our example. So I just checked or BBP (?). So this standard preserving privacy and conduct tracing. and here we can see the growing frequency of this word.\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*So it's based on the time difference, not on the frequency count, absolute frequency count, per se. I'm trying to understand what the null model is, how can you say one thing is more frequently than another?*\n\n**Michal:**  \nSo we have different options. We can check for a mean of all weeks, let's say, or we can see what is the biggest difference between the beginning and the end, right?  So we can also do some normalizations. We have experimented with different methods. But first of all, we see which of these words are characterized by growing popularity in the whole period. And then we choose this which had the biggest positive trend overall these weeks.\n\n**Kristof:** \nSo the basic idea is that for every more for every source, we have this average frequency, recreate for every month a weighted value based on the source. And then we have this regression, where we can calculate these trends. How did this frequency evolve over time? So, here what was also a tricky thing is to try to make justice for different sources, because we have very big sources such as TechCrunch or Reuters. We also have a bunch of small but relevant in the European discussion, like <unknown>, <unknown>, so we had different approaches. We had one approach where it was a weighted average, so the size of the source, the number of articles published by the source has been the basis of the weight. So that was how we rated the values. But we also had a version where we gave equal weight for every source, or we even give higher priority for the smaller ones, but the ones that can maybe have greater coverage of social issues. So there was also some results, not in this analysis, because here we have quite a small time period. So now we are just analyzing news from the beginning of January until the beginning of May. But during the entire activation internet projects, we have been collecting articles for quite a lot of time - for around three and a half years. And then we had some greater space on how to solve this issue.\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*And all of the 52 Top Words were all COVID relevant.*\n\n**Kristof:**  \nSo here at the first visualization, where do we have the bubbles, it has been filtered by us based on the top thousand trending words. So we created this list, which is the top thousand most sounding words. And then we started to filter out the relevant terms. So that's why this tool is semi-automatic. So it enables to relatively quickly identify the trending terms. And the task is especially easy when you can see the different relationships and how the topics come together. So for example, social distancing, and lockdown and so on. So these words appeared at the beginning of the list.\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*I wanted to ask you if it's possible, or it doesn't even make sense to compare these trends that you're presenting to other trends that might have occurred in other major events of 21st century like for example, in 2008, global economic depression, because I guess that anxiety was also one of the trending words. So maybe it's worth looking into it.*\n\n**Michal:**  \nThis is a very nice idea. The problem is to have comparable sources because I wonder if social media data is available for this period.\n\n**Kristof:**  \nIt's a very interesting suggestion. And I'm sure that someone has already done something like that because social media data is getting increasingly relevant also in macroeconomics, so how to forecast economic events based around words in use, and so on. So we don't know the answer to this specifically if we can use Reddit for 2008. My intuition is that yes, and I'm sure that that it is it would be very interesting research, and hopefully someone will do that. Maybe we will find time as you say because that's an emerging research area so how to use social data for also in this context.\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*Okay, so let's, let's imagine that we can actually compare this data. You find the time and you find the source and everything is nice and beautiful. What kind of conclusions could you draw from such a comparison? Because those are major events. But they're hardly comparable when it comes to the trigger that started these events, and how people respond to the timelines. So if you were to compare it, I guess my question is, what kind of scientific question you would like to answer with your research and with your data?*\n\n**Michal:**  \nFirst of all, I've just checked and subreddit for anxiety was created in 2008. It might be the case that we could do it.\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*I am from the University of Warsaw. And I'm curious, did you consider sharing this data in some subReddits, maybe some nationalism Subreddits. I'm very curious about how their editors were faced with this data.*\n\n**Michal:**\nSo when it comes to visualizations, I guess we might try to post it on \"Data is Beautiful\", or a colleague who is doing most of his visualizations is always saying that they are not ready. So maybe in future iterations, they will finally be ready to be posted there. I just wanted to answer also, the question of Kasha.\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*Just a question based on training on sentiment. And second that you employed any kind of benchmark for sentiment analysis algorithms?*\n\n**Michal:**  \nOkay, so answering the question about a DA <?>. We have used this algorithm for topic modelling on this news data set. And again on a data set of introductions to all of the repositories on GitHub. In the first case, the articles were longer. And because the introductions are basically two or three sentences, in the case of articles, the texts were much longer. And it was used as a tool for summing up the main topics in the news. We often use topic modelling, because it's a nice tool for identifying Latin, Latin topics in the data sets we analyze. So it's for the first step of the analysis, right? So just to summarize a corpus of texts, all the codes related to LDA are available on our GitHub. So if you are interested in some technical details, how we do it, how we choose the parameters for this algorithm, or how we, how we compare the results, it's all there. We have a working paper on <unknown> Where we...\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*So it's on website.  And then on trends for trends within define privacy, you also fall into LDA or no? <very hard to make out what is being said>*\n\n**Michal:**  \nSo, there was one attempt in this analysis to do this topic modelling dynamic\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*to put the trends together where you put the right trends - that big picture of trends.*\n\n**Michal:**  \nSo, what we have done was something pretty different. What we have done in this time dimension was to see how topic evolves. So, we have used a tool which is called dynamic topic modelling, where we identify topics in the corpus and then see how during our analysis period these topics evolved. So you can see it maybe I will start..\n\n**Kristof:**\nFor for this section of the analysis, we mostly use topic modelling Just to give us context, and then we started to use this dynamic topic modelling, which enables us to see also changes in topics, how the frequency of the probability of different words changed in a given topic. So, for example, here, you can see topic one, this appeared as a big topic, collecting the articles on COVID-19. And here it is, the thing that you can see is that how the difference which are the interesting words that had a big change in their probability over time, so, this is our first experiment with dynamic topic modelling. In this example, what has been interesting for us is to see, for example, this change in in in different geographic names, so, New York appear from the end of March in this topic, but previously it has been not present So it suggests as the news stories about COVID-19 and New York, appeared just at the end of March. And on the other hand, China had this strong presence in January, and they gradually decreased. So you can see these kinds of dynamics within a topic. Coming back to your question. If we use the LDA to identify trends, then at this stage, we focused on the buying. So the stuff that's happening in the bubbles at the beginning of the presentation that's based on these time-frequency analyses and regression analyses, and we didn't use LDA, for an automatic generation of trends, but we often think about it and if you do find a way to do that, I'm sure that we'll report on it. And when it comes to the question, I think we all we have just one question related to sentiment analysis. \n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*Is there any kind of benchmark for sentiment analysis as part of your project?*\n\n**Kristof:**  \nSo here We use sentiment tool called Vader. And it is based on training on social media and mostly for shorter snippets of text. And this has been the tool that we have been using.\n\n**Michal:**  \nis a dictionary-based tool, a lexicon-based tool where all the words are given sentiment, right?\n\n**Host:**  \nBecause you asked a question, and then we started to go there, but we didn't really go there.\n\n**Michal:**  \nIt's a good one. This question about the comparison between, let's say, 2008. And today's situation, right? What we could do about it, what's referred to quite often is this hype cycle when it comes to technologies, right, this Gartner hype curve, and maybe there is something with such disasters or uncommon races like pandemics or financial crisis, that can be represented in some sort of curve right? So what we could do as we are not field experts. So we are not psychologists, but we are data scientists. So what we could do is to compare these curves. We could do some econometrics and time series analysis to compare trends in, let's say, this anxiety separated. This is something would be interesting for us to check out. I think it would be also interesting to cooperate with some psychologists and think more about this the future.\n\n**Host:**  \nDid you map the depression part going back to 2008 too? I thought it was curious that anxiety would go up but in which I would expect but depression went down. That I didn't really get.\n\n**Michal:**  \nThis is interesting. And what we thought is that maybe it's the case that I guess what we are observing is ability <?>n, not actual symptoms, or patients, but rather narratives or discourse about mental health. So it might be the case that during such events, you are expressing more active problems and you are more agitated. Or let's say you are not expressing symptoms of depression on social media, maybe after being you know, quarantined for a while, you start to start doing it again. But in the beginning, it's more about anxiety, right,d about something unexpected. It's my take on it as a layman in psychology. But what data says is what we present here, and it's a sharp increase in comments and posts about anxiety and an interesting decrease in posts and comments in the subreddit about depression.\n\n**Host:**  \nI think that also connects to this question of how then research questions formulated or addressed with this type of research. How would this data set that comes together, then come together with, for example, the psychologist or the researcher who then formulate the research question.\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*Yes, exactly. How do you communicate your research to different fields? That is important.*\n\n**Michal:**  \nThat's a tricky question for us. We are in this good position that in the lab, we are an interdisciplinary team of researchers. So we work daily basis with lawyers and people from the sociology department, mostly. And we have some discussions where we try to communicate our results to them, and they make use of this data. But we are really open to cooperating with all social scientists and scientists on it. If you have any ideas and or suggestions on how we can do it better please go on.\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*I'm not I don't have any suggested sorry. I was just curious. But thank you for circling back to my question.* \n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*I would like to propose something, Tt may be a bit crazy, but following up on what Kasha said, I like this idea of the hybrid technique in which you would have some kind of domain expert, helping to channel the mass of data. And along those lines, I wonder if we could kind of dream up a methodology that looks like this: you get a bunch of domain experts to produce some kind of statement, think of it as a focus group. And they will say something like, and I'm quoting the one we had on surveillance pandemic, about a month ago, they will say something like, \"policymakers tend to overestimate the effectiveness of technology-based surveillance vis a vis the pandemic.\" Now, once you have a statement like this, which is exaggerated with respect to the data, then maybe you can use the data to find echoes of it in the data source. So in this case, you would be looking for something like, \"everybody agrees everybody in the know, expert, the community agrees with x, where x is the statement. And so in this case, the way we work is an example of solutionism, you would find a bunch of solutions words solution effective efficient, real-time scalable algorithmic stuff like that. Then see if this kind of language trends, even though we have a problem of the null, the counterfactual. Does it trend more than average of whatever analysis, then see if it co-occurs with epidemics language. You will build another vector of epidemics word - COVID Coronavirus pandemic whatever. And if it co-occurs with tech solutions to the pandemic, like contact tracing app, link and sees if it co-occurs with things like dodgy surveillance companies that will also mention the same focus group as treating versus abusing opportunity, Palantir, etc. If sentiment is negative if all of this occurs, it means that there is an association between solutionist language and pandemic, there is one. And it is looked upon with scepticism or with these negative sentiment by the community for whatever values of a community. And in that case, you could say, well, we dreamed up this thing in a focus group, but actually looks like it's in line with what is coming out of the data. So there will be a sort of fairly complete method in the sense that at least it triangulates a theme otherwise you're always left with this kind of anomalies, but it's very hard to interpret. Is that possible to do?*\n\n**Kristof:**\nYes, maybe not in its glory was way that you described, but for sure it is necessary. So when it comes to the analysis of word combinations, or sentiments, or even trending terms, it is very important to have a feedback if it actually makes sense on the one hand, and on the other hand to reach areas we should go deeper.  When we are working on these kinds of analyses, then we are always selecting certain areas to prepare some deep dives some case studies similarly as in this presentation and to have these kinds of meetings where we are together with experts from different fields and they are drawing our attention to certain areas. This is very useful for us because then just as you mentioned, we can, for example, look into this kind of word combinations and check back in our data if the general consensus in tech journalism somehow corresponds to their opinion.\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*Yeah, so, in that case, you would have an exogenously generated list of words and that is what makes the whole model kind of clench into action because now you're not pulling stuff out of whatever you actually know what you're looking for, because somebody else is externally validating that those are relevant words. And that we could kind of maybe try and do with this particular, call it to focus group, but we could do others. And by the way, practical reasons we couldn't record encode the text of the code, but if we could have, which we will in the future, then we would have precise words and group of words that you could simply just feed to your algorithm and see what comes out of it. Like the exact words that people use this to describe the problem at hand. This will get a fix somehow and the problem I feel.*\n\n**Kristof:**  \nso we had one in the project before our results were presented at the workshop for an expert group. The workshop was organized by Argus University, so by our team members, and actually the process was that we suggested a bunch of trending topics on the project website. And they show the presentation to the experts, who then had a great discussion if actually, our suggestion that, for example, different economic aspects of the technology should be devoted greater research into words such as platform competition, or privacy, this kind of stuff. So they vetted our suggested topics are also the most relevant to them. And there was some agreement. There were also some disagreements, and in the end, we prepared a best-off list of trending stuff that are trending according to the data and the title events are also according to the experts. So please do we do such workshops It was very useful.\n\n**Host:**  \nI didn't see the word equality or inequality coming up, and at least from where I sit this pandemic and inequality and now, I mean I realize the broad term, but at least it's super relevant for us over here: racism. In other words, are the handling of immigrants or outsiders, these things cannot be separated. You can't solve any one of them without the others. Maybe that would come up now, whereas it didn't so much before.\n\n**Michal:**  \nI have just checked and till the end of May, the word inequality was not trending in technological news, either was racism. It's interesting to be the case when we iterate again, or analysis and do the update the results because I agree that, especially when we choose U.S. sources might be the case that these issues will be really interrelated.\n\n**Host:**  \nDo you know how Reddit is distributed geographically? Does anybody know that? I mean, is it dominated by American comments now?\n\n**Michal:**  \nSo it depends on the subreddit. But what we want to do is to choose major subreddits of all EU countries and analyze the data.\n\n**Kristof:**  \nSo when it comes to like this inequality aspect, then maybe we didn't pick up the word inequality itself. But we find such words that are socially relevant as for example, stockpiling or furlough, this whole area related to unemployment, I remember we also had quite a lot of results on the gig economy. So that press is also covering in an increased manner, this relationship between technology and social issues. I think we also need to check vulnerability and justice Alberto is suggesting.\n\n**Host:**  \nI was curious as important as what the information that is in the graph, that is also how you introduce and how you present background information, things like The Reddit that we are drawing this from started in this year or at this point a riot started which changed the meaning of that word or if something like GitHub is used less in China due to the different product being used, and therefore things that would influence that data. And there is a myriad also things and I just imagined that it is very hard to figure out the right balance of how to write a legend so it presents all the background information that you need to properly understand and not misunderstand trends that you see in a graph. But also, to have that in a way that people will still read it at all because if you put all of it in a) nobody reads it b) it's just like you have to draw a line somewhere to have something to say.\n\n**Kristof:**\nSo Reddit to data is is a great challenge in this aspect because, in the case of news articles, you have a relatively clean data, which is worse structure <?> than when the context is relatively straightforward, but in the case of Reddit is a much more complex data source before these different shades and additional context that you mentioned. So to find the right way to analyze the data, definitely, some insights from social scientists are necessary to really dive into the discussion on Reddit in a way that is representative for the communities over there. We had some struggles finding the right ways to analyze this data. And thank you very much for all the suggestions for the things to be checked because it will help us to design the research for next iterations. \n\n**Michal:**\nThat is a tough one balancing presenting everything from events but not overflowing our users or our audience. This is something we are struggling with. And recently we focused on our team on creating tutorials to our analysis. So when you have basic knowledge of data science, you can use our GitLab code and seek for growing keywords you can seek for hidden topics in this data sets for yourself and calculate everything we have done so far but using different hypothesis or research questions. I know that there is still this difficulty because you still got to know the basics of Python. But at the moment, we cannot do anything about it.\n\n**Host:**\nAre you documenting those weights like how people interpret and use it in different ways?\n\n**Audience Comment**  \n*Yes, this was focused on recent works. We hope that is understandable right now. You can check for yourself and check our tutorials. We have put a lot of effort so that they are visible. Maybe in the future, we can do it even you know, for people I don't use Python, I guess we can create some interface for users just to type in some keywords, and there would be the results of our analysis. Maybe in the future.*\n\n**Host:**  \nYou looked at the news, the press, and you looked at Reddit, I'm curious, did you analyze what the news said and then analyze what Reddit said, to see if they matched up much? In other words, let's say that Reddit is an example of \"the people.\"  And then you get the press. Is there alignment as to what they're talking about? Or is there a bit of a mismatch?\n\n**Michal:**  \nThis is something we want to do, or I guess, two or three years to compare the sources, but we don't still don't have a good methodology for that. What we had done previously was just to compare the discourse about certain things on Reddit and in news, so see what is the vocabulary used around certain topics. And we found that, for example, when you use Reddit, this discourse is really, really different as narratives in media. The vocabulary is \"mediatized\", right? And you can find very interesting keywords when you project our angles on viewing some issues related to technology when you analyze Reddit. But it's very difficult to compare them, let's say on one axis. Alberto already mentioned the problem with this null model or baselines and we had this problem in case of single sources, but when you want to compare across sources, the problem is even bigger. Right now, what we will focus on probably is creating baselines in all sources, in all single sources. So for example, there was this question about how we measured this growth against all the comments in the source. So this is something we will work in the future. If you know any good methodologies where people convert social media with news, we are happy to look at them. But we didn't find any good right now.\n\n**Kristof:**\nNothing similar. \n\n**Michal:**\nWe wanted to do with research papers. To see whether there is one source that is ahead of the other. So is it the case that researchers are taking ideas from popular media or is it the other way around or is it different across disciplines? This is something easier to do, I guess. But social media is so dynamic that it's difficult to compare with the news.\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*But is it difficult because of the manpower or lack thereof or is it difficult because of the lack of proper methodology?*\n\n**Audience comment:** \n*The second thing - it is the second problem. We don't have any good idea on how to normalize this data.* \n\n**Kristof:**\nIn the case of news, we can always take into account the number of articles or some other things to normalize. In the case of Reddit, it is challenging to find this single value that we can attach a certain topic or certain words. So, definitely, it needs a well-prepared methodology to see these kinds of comparisons.\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*The null model problem is the bane of data science, you know, this kind of keeps coming up in all sorts of problems, maybe because we tend to under theorize and so of course, you have this kind of regularities. But in a case like this, I would probably try to go down the collective intelligence path. So instead of looking too much around, like trying to identify in authoritative, but large enough data source, so imagine you're talking about information, security or say, Okay, I'm gonna just focus on the Chaos Computer Club. So what those guys say goes, because they are the crowd that knows this stuff. And then you would focus on there, whatever their online watering holes are and just ignore everything else. Because also you can be super polluted.  The media, you know, vehicle by hype cycles, you get a lot of garbage in and then you will get some kind of garbage out. So maybe instead of big data, it becomes a more hybrid methodology, which is a quantitative validation of expert opinion that will be already. It means that most experts agree, even if you're trying to do policy I used to work for government myself, if you can tell your minister look, yes, there are a few outliers, outliers but by and large, this is what people are saying that is valuable to them.*\n\n**Michal:**  \nYes, such a hybrid method is something we are aiming at. We see ourselves as a foundation for such a discussion, not with the solution, but just to provide some basic info for further investigation.\n\n**Host:**  \nI was also wondering, you also before, described how you're opening this up to people to use your code, how you want to open it up to more people to use it, who can't use Python and such. And I think this also leads to what due diligence .connects back to how do you write the right legends to what thing. And do you need to do at which point if when you share your data with people in your own field, then you have a certain baseline already but you know, what they know about they know to ask for how is this to look for certain background information may be on their own, the more we are opening up those things, the more people then take that differently, maybe? But at the same time, you also need to make this accessible to people. So how do you balance out this opening up data across disciplines in a larger context? And who is responsible when for how stuff is then taken and read, like, when a journalist takes a graph that was there for two researchers to talk about, and it's not now finished 100%. But it's just the start of a conversation. But now, the journalist takes it and puts it into a different forum, that changes the content of that, how do we deal with something like that?\n\n**Kristof:**  \nThis is a great question because that's like a big problem or big challenge for the entire academia now, like how to communicate results in a way that you have social resonance. And how do you prepare and present your results for different stakeholders and I don't think that we have an ultimate solution for that because ourselves are struggling when it comes to this presentation but also in our different research fields. So Michal is working on privacy research, which is rather complicated and, and but is relevant for the society. I'm doing a different empirical search on Airbnb and sometimes I have this kind of conversation with journalists. Often the problem is that you have very nuanced results with different aspects to it. And then it gets very oversimplified or there's a huge overstatement of the results are taken to the extreme, and that's a big challenge. So what we try to do is to filter down our analysis as much as possible. So even if the presentation that we have shown you contains, like, lots of aspects, very different data sources, we really frame this to the best way we could because we tried to find some narratives that that can be shown and that is not that confusing. But what we also try to do is to prepare some blog posts where we provide greater detail of the methodology than in a short presentation. So we try to make different versions for different communities, different observers of our results.\n\n**Audience comment:**  \n*as an X researcher, as an astronomer, and as a teacher now, I would like to tell you that there is a great space for communicating science, but you need people for this. I mean, we have these places that are called science centres, or science museums where you can do your science hands-on, but it mostly boils down to physics, biology, maybe chemistry, but it's very difficult to do Museum of Science for research that you do. So you need some kind of intermediate person who is going to understand your science deeply enough. And then is going to speak, so to speak a common language to communicate that science to the public. So it's very nice that you're trying to model your output. So different groups can understand it. But frankly speaking, I don't think this is your job. Your job as a researcher is to produce science. You need another person to understand that science and then speak up for you. And for your research. That would be great. But if you have any ideas, how to how to put science into the science museums, that would be even better, then everyone can see I think this is great media for that great outlook.*\n\n**Host:**  \nYeah, that's a great point. And I think even if you ask those questions here, it is not that you are then the one responsible here, but as you said, somebody needs to be responsible for how and where is it communicated and presented. So maybe I'm also interested in everybody's opinion here, on where those things critical questions should be addressed. And where responsibilities lie. Some of them lie with researchers. But not all of them can. It's a multi-layered community and society where responsibilities lie on different levels.\n\n**Host:**  \nWe are now at the end of our appointed timeframe for this discussion. This was really interesting. And I want to thank everybody.\n\n**Kristof:**  \nThank you all. Thank you very much for all the questions and helpful comments. It has been a great pleasure for us to come and see you and talk about the results because I think we have spent a relatively large amount of time on doing research, but less on communicating the results as we would have wished. So we are very grateful for this opportunity. And please do get in touch with us in case of further questions. You can find our contact information on the DE Lab website, D lab UW. We are also on Twitter. And meet also on the Edgeryder Platform to bring the conversation further.\n\n**Michal:**  \nExactly.

Within the human niche, geo-endowments, like water, are a shared resource. As societal context, the human niche is a planetary network of natural and cultural landscapes. They are knotted by global supply chains and restlessly alter through engineering, production and consumption. Entangled by them, human agents face counter-intuitive system-behaviour, irreversible path-dependency and multi-facet values and interests. Geoethical thinking explores cultural substrates that would nurture the skills of agents and their operational circumstances when facing suchlike system-features.\n\nInitially, geoscientists conceived geoethics for their professional functions in various societal and scientific contexts. Subsequently, geoethics evolved into an epistemic, moral hybrid for citizens interacting with the Earth system. Furthering geoethics \u2013 combining it with Kohlberg\u2019s hierarchy of moral adequacy and Jonas\u2019s imperative of responsibility \u2013 results in a \u2018geoethical rational\u2019, namely, to act: *\u2018actor-centric, virtue-ethics focused, responsibility focused, knowledge-based, all-actor-inclusive, and universal-rights based\u2019* .\n\nThe geoethical rationale, formulated at a normative meta-level, is designed to apply in any societal or scientific context that is relevant for geosciences, modulated in a case-specific manner. The geoethical rationale supports agents (geoscientists, citizens) to navigate the human niche, framing how to handle its diversity.", "created_at": "2019-09-26 15:46:12.717802", "updated_at": "2019-09-26 15:46:12.717802", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 313, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67152, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12131, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Hand gestures are especially useful when you are recording the conversation and even more so if you then transcribe the conversation.", "created_at": "2019-12-08 14:06:38.947903", "updated_at": "2019-12-08 14:06:38.947903", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 28.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [67133], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42763, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 8297, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Good points.

In my opinion that is no good, and among other things will also reflect very poorly on Europe, its elites, and its citizens in a historic context.\n\nThat is why I think for example espousing a conciliatory vibe would be really important (also with a look at demographics). \n\nNow my actual idea:\nThe framework is exceedingly simple (in fact it is printed on our money!):\nMeet on bridges for a festival (conversation pieces would be awesome), and/or open your windows for a day in a show of sympathy and support (let's hope it isn't in January - but even if it is that would make the message stand out well).\nOf course an idea behind windows and bridges is that they are connecting elements. \nBut they are also quite elaborate constructs of civilization that can easily leave the user in somewhat of a precarious situation (or fail if not maintained properly, hashtag MAMA) - very much reflecting the perceived political vibe around Europe I think. \nThis hints at the multitude of dimensions one can easily explore under this parable, and allow citizens to reconnect with such experiences on a very visceral level and reflect on them.", "created_at": "2019-11-28 00:07:38.086112", "updated_at": "2019-11-28 00:25:50.902754", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 386, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 27.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [137], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34536, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 6755, "post_number": 2, "raw": "So you demonstrated it's possible to make protection (the pagoda) and food (the composting and growing) out of free material (trash).

They show a \"half geodesic dome\" structure made with that technique later in the video, which seems closest to a pagoda in function.\n\n* **[Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com/en/):** A \"DIY industrial\" toolkit for recycling plastic. With their [compressor machine plans](https://preciousplastic.com/en/videos/build/compression/) you could build a machine for making roof shingles out of waste plastic.\n\n* **Soil Maker:** A machine, or just a set of \"recipes\", to take all kinds of ingredients like compost, different soils, sand, wood chips, [biochar](/tags/project-biochar-rocket-stove), clay etc. and analyze, grind, mix and cure them into different types of high-quality soils, as needed by different plants. Would be nice to have, as it would encapsulate the task of making soil \u2013 which is difficult, as you experienced. Could even become a business idea when done on a larger scale.\n\nThe soil maker is just an idea I once had.

I never got the idea that my family was very involved with the spiritual ideas behind the catholic religion. For them it was just a way of life to pay lip service to religion. That makes is even more startling that my parents and their brothers &amp; sisters all structured their lifes , including something so private as the choice for a partner in life, within the boundaries of what their religion prescribes. It is not like in Italy that everybody was catholic. There were also lots of protestants families living in the same villages. They knew each other very well, but they didn't live together. And from a certain point of view it worked very well, the communities were living peacefully next to each other for hundred of years. Sure, after the Reformation took place the protestant religion was the only religion which was accepted and the catholics had to go underground. But even that worked out pretty well because no one was bothering them. From a societal point of view the Dutch did very well in being so tolerant. On the other hand, the decisions of the regents at the end of the 16th century very much affected the lifes of individuals even almost 400 years later.\u00a0\n\nAnd when you think about the crisis in our current economic system, we have to remember that most of the current system is based on financial innovations which were done in the beginning of the 17th century. The dominant belief then was that people were selfish and only behaved themselves in a proper way because of the fear for God. The religion thing we have settled in the last decennia, at least in most western countries. The thing about people being selfish we have to re-examine again in order to get the economic problems fixed.

If we **have** agreed to measure something, having trustworth numbers is also a a challenge._\n\n### 3.

More often than not, they reinforce an unhelpful \u2018producer-consumer\u2019 distinction. Some actors (organisations/experts) are seen to \u2018produce\u2019 (innovate, design, deliver) value, whereas others (\u2018beneficiaries\u2019 or \u2018users\u2019) are seen to \u2018consume\u2019 it.\n\n\n### Resources for thinking more widely than user centred design\n\nThere's some good writing from Design Dialogues, with links to some new tools, including a systems design toolkit to facilitate discussions.

We aim to explore how we can prepare for a finite, post-climate change earth through practical and hands on action, initiated by conversation.\n\nThere will be no speakers, instead we have facilitated conversations, harvested and shared with a larger European network of Edgeryders as part of a distributed festival in order to let the word spread far beyond our physical space, while also finding each other in the flesh.\n\nThe intention is to create a network of people who are interested in transforming the world and to have conversations about this, in line with the topics at hand. This event is held as part of a continental festival held in 10 different locations across Europe: https://festival.edgeryders.eu/\n\nThe main fields to be focused on is:\n\n- Resilient Tech\n\n- Networks &amp; Communities\n\n- Sustainable Futurism and Solarpunk\n\nSIGN UP TO HOST A SESSION:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2MxNI1k\n\nThis event is bringing together people who are currently directly involved in building, researching, regulating, monetising and or providing meaningful input into the wider debate around the technologies in question. We want to ensure that every participant leaves the venue having presented and discussed their work with others who can provide meaningful input or connect them with opportunities to further their goals. If this appeals to you, then we would love to have you join us. Just create an edgeryders account and introduce yourself to the community.\n\n**How is this all financed?**\n\nThis event is part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016. It has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 825652 from 2019-2021. You can learn more about the initiative and our involvement in it at https://ngi.edgeryders.eu\n\n### Format\n\nThe event will be divided into two parts:\n\n1. A smaller \u201ccrew\u201d get together the day before with the participants in the network who are especially invited.\n2. A larger event with multiple tables for hosting conversations. At least three sessions at a time structured as a world cafe with an approximation of 2-3 rounds of conversations ending with a wrap up and a 1-2-4-all.\n\nThere will be an opportunity to host conversations until all the slots are filled up.\n\nBefore the event there will be a sign up to host conversations. Each sign up will be presented the same way a regular presenter is usually presented at a conference with a short text / video description of them in preparation.\n\nThe intention is to create a network of people who are interested in transforming the world and to have conversations about this, in line with the topics at hand.\n\nThe event will take place at Lodgatan in \u00d6stra Hamnen in Malm\u00f6, Sweden with room for up to 200 guests but we are aiming for far less. This event is seen as an iteration with potential for hosting more events in the future.\n<br>\n\n<hr>\n\n# Frequently asked questions\n\n### How do I get an invitation/ticket to this workshop?\n\n**Complete the registration form: https://register.edgeryders.eu/**\n\n### How is this event being organised?\n\nThis event, and the festival it is part of, is coordinated on the edgeryders platform (where you are now) and co-curated through a series of community video calls. We have allocated a collaboratively managed budget for the festival and operate on a solidarity basis. Participants who need some financial support to organise or be able to participate in the festival are eligible provided they contribute towards making it a meaningful and generative experience for all - in the run up to, during and/or after the event. If you would like to join us but are unsure as to how to contribute, don\u2019t worry. Create an [edgeryders account](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login), then [tell us a bit about yourself here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/tell-us-about-you) and we will guide you along from there.\n\n\n### How is this all financed?\n\nThis event is part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016.

The consultation methodology is designed in such a way as to allow for diversity of views, premises, disciplines, themes and contexts. We employ open notebook science principles and the results will be presented in the form of a research report accessible to everyone after the event. You can follow the process, review the methodology and open source tech we are using and engage directly with the research and coordination team here: https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/workspace\n\n### What is the code of conduct?\n\nIt is important to us that everyone in the room feels welcomed and safe; if you have any particular concerns or needs just send me a PM here on the platform or write to [nadia@edgeryders.eu](mailto:nadia@edgeryders.eu) .\n\nThe Edgeryders online platform technology and activities are intended for people to cooperate within and across projects trying to build a better world.

While event registration was set up on edgeryders for German-speaking participants, online registration was not often used, instead participants contacted the organizing team via email.  \n\n[...] how difficult it is to create conversations for people who bring concerns and interests but have little patience for the kind of academic exchanges that may or may not operate well within the boundaries and logics of academia but certainly don\u2019t easily open up to create welcoming atmospheres for first-timers.\n[/quote]\n\nYeah, story of my life. Back in 2013, we started looking into early Western monasticism as a possible solution to this. The idea is: \n\n1. Optimize [human-to-human communication protocols](/t/4748) for working together. \n2. Be open to any newcomer, but insist on the protocol being non-negotiable.\n\nWe know from cultural evolution biology (for example [Joseph Enrich](https://secretofoursuccess.fas.harvard.edu/) and [E. O. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson)) that human evolution is driven by [group selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection), as well as individual selection. In the evolutionary history of *homo sapiens*, there is a clear pattern: the groups that are best at collaborating (while being able to protect themselves from free riders) win. \n\nSince Edgeryders' \"hello world\" post in 2011, we have been constantly asked for smoother user experience, lower-effort onboarding, and, yes, multiple languages. We have tried to accommodate, with various degrees of success. Eight years on, the jury is still out about the ROI of all that work. There is a tradeoff: when you create a fun, nice event, more people will join it than would be willing to discuss on online platform, so that's a win. The loss is that these people are now mostly going to communicate with each other at the scale of the event (in the tens of people) as opposed to those who are using the platform (in the thousands of people). The interaction breaks down, and I am convinced that the intelligence in \"collective intelligence\" is in the interaction, in all but the trivial cases (like guessing the weight of a pig at the Plymouth country fair). \n\nIn principle, there is a solution: highly [modular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(networks)), but still connected, interaction networks. These are instantiated by people being in the small worlds of local events, and connecting them with the larger world of the online discussion, like you, @soenke, are doing here. In practice, these solutions work more by art than by science, and we have not completely cracked the problem yet. :frowning:", "created_at": "2019-12-29 12:46:33.216778", "updated_at": "2019-12-31 11:43:49.295792", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 478, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 28.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [67889], "is_reply_to": [67889], "is_liked_by": [4892], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69206, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12479, "post_number": 12, "raw": "what's snow got to do with it?", "created_at": "2020-01-22 17:11:46.923883", "updated_at": "2020-01-22 17:11:46.923883", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [69194], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60299, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10962, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I don't like it, I'm sorry! :frowning: \n\n* Style is watercolor-y, not solarpunk at all. \n* Is that a coral to the left? \n* What would the blue thing in the center be?\n\nThe solarpunk aesthetics is more like this (but I also like Nadia's examples).\n\n![image|690x388](upload://3jV3ac9Z7ooaR4vgSzZnLrcfxG4.jpeg) \n\n![image|517x690](upload://sdQivnQ9qUPhODygta3Z5Oenw6a.jpeg) \n\n![image|690x517](upload://mpSBXtnUO8kdOxxuRdh12wdcunO.jpeg) \n\n![image|458x690](upload://uBwhfd4jij5fpNrrMcrR7Bjsse3.jpeg) ![image|690x517](upload://mpSBXtnUO8kdOxxuRdh12wdcunO.jpeg)", "created_at": "2019-10-01 14:30:34.935000", "updated_at": "2019-10-01 14:30:34.935000", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 72, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 12.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65736, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 11903, "post_number": 2, "raw": "In the call we discussed some ways to accomplish this, but no airtight conclusions.

I fully understand the importance of the connection of personal experiences and examples to the abstract discussions. The texts that are developed from the interviews such as this one: https://edgeryders.eu/t/can-tech-design-for-survivors-how-sex-violence-and-power-are-encoded-into-the-design-and-implementation-of-data-ai-driven-sexual-misconduct-reporting-systems/11193 can provide this especially since @inge did a great job getting it out. However, I would like to ask the Ethnography team (@amelia) on their opinion on the influence of the length of a post on its ability to create ongoing interwoven discussion. Do you have any insight on that? There are certainly posts that are too short to lead to meaningful discussions, but could it also be that if a post gets too long and dense, that kind of decreases the ability of the community to engage into a discussion of the different aspects since the discussion will develop along the lines of the first few comments which in return will become the source of following comments which will mainly zoom in on one aspect of the original post and morph that on further?", "created_at": "2019-10-31 15:54:59.851340", "updated_at": "2019-11-04 07:21:44.375176", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 335, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 24.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [62621], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66089, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 11104, "post_number": 9, "raw": "All done now.\n\n(I renamed the menu item to \"Next Steps\" to fit for the post-event situation.)", "created_at": "2019-11-28 01:01:55.439464", "updated_at": "2019-11-28 01:01:55.439464", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [66029], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81877, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 11904, "post_number": 17, "raw": "[quote=\"edgeryders, post:1, topic:11904\"]\nApply [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule), so that opinions expressed during the event are noted, but not attributed to anyone.

(e.g. Skype call, in person meeting, etc).\n-\n\n3)\tWhat are the main themes of the story, and what kind of call to action is the orignal story making?\nThe call of the author is for more awareness of individuals around the topic.\nJenny in a comment: \u201c_I believe that every action has a political meaning -picking up my fork, paying for whatever I decide to buy is done to fill my stomach, but without realising it much it is also a highly political action.

I am not sure they know about our local call center project in Thessaloniki, but I am glad that this article and your comment gave the opportunity for this 'connection'_\n\nSomeone who is a therapist connected with other professionals in Greece:\nChristine to Ybe: _I am in contact with people working in alternative health and spiritual health projects here in Greece so I could put you in contact with them, if you are interested._\n\nOn a broader level, the connections made involved sharing experiences of refugee camps, sharing new projects of which participants didn\u2019t know about previously: ex a projects of making bags from discarded materials, by refugees in Lesbos.\n\n2)\tWhat further action was taken?

If so, what kind?\nYes, she asked for advice.\n\n**Backpacks for the refugees  (29 OCT)**\n\n(event nature) 4. Conversation for action: a sequence of interactions related to a given matter of concern, aiming at changing the state of things.\n(event goal) c. Knowledge creating: actions aiming at producing original care-related knowledge. e. Product designing/realizing: actions to collaboratively conceive and realize care-related products.\n\nThe conversations range from the bottom up effort of organizing help, to the uncertainty factors and social dynamics underpinning the refugee crisis. They go more in depth with respect to the public institutions role on coordinating responses and funding.\nTwo conversations in the conversation show explicit exploration and intent for collaboration: one where people discuss what is an effective list and way of packing things for incoming refugees (trythis and Aravella), the other is about meeting up in Thessaloniki (Alex and Aravella). They are joined together in the idea of creating an event to build a 'Citizens guide to supporting people in an emergency' (trythis, Alex and Aravella)\n\n1)Trythis: _Let me think out loud about the list a little._\n_You need to give a lot of information in very little time. It is important that it can be understood quickly. It is also important that people understand why some things are better than other things. Here is what I would try []_(9 NOV)\n\n_2) Aravella: @Alex Levene when will you visit Greece? Let me know your plan so maybe I can help. (10 DEC)_\n_Alex: I have sent you an email._\n_3)Alex: I still think that a hackathon like this would be best suited to taking place in Greece or Italy, where the incoming flow is still increasing and there is a high likelihood that another disaster may occur (i'm thinking about the recent Italian Earthquakes)._ \n\nPredominant ethnotags: list of needs for refugees, funding\nOther participants: Ybe, Noemi, Alberto\nYbe: I am very moved by your story and I like the idea of including 'a wish' in every backpack so much. (2 NOV)\n\n\n**Comparative considerations**\n\n1)\tAcross your stories, can you sense any kind of common theme? Topically? Structurally? In terms of the call to action? \n\nWith the exception of one, all stories were focused on practical actions or projects taken on by the authors. In these stories, interlocutors seem to be interested to share information and experiences. \nThe common theme is **activism in a structural, deep way**. Topically, it comes delivered more or less specifically in conversations about **awareness of key refugee issues and cooperation** for better results at the society level.\n\nAnother common theme is **crowd support (crowdfunding, crowdsourcing.. )** for initiatives.\n\nAnother common theme is **politics, seen through the normative role** ascribed by participants to governments. While the first arguments are made to research solutions, support projects and call for donations \u2013 the issue of cooperation and taking actions in more effective ways often spills over into deeper discussions about the government\u2019s role.\n\n2)\tDid the stories follow any kind of pattern?\n\n\u2022\tThe community managers made the first step to tell authors of the original post about other initiatives.. From one point on the people connected with each other across and beyond the immediate response to a community manager\u2019s request for more info, details etc.\n\u2022\tThis means often more conversations play out in parallel.\n\u2022\tThe authors all made bold statements about the problems they/ their projects are confronted with. their calls to action often emphasized a state of crisis and emergency. This departs from their localized problems, but the problems and the way individuals contextualize them places the core of the issue at a bigger level \u2013 the network, societal level. A proof of this is the fact that people from other countries resonate deeply with the issues described by the original post authors.\n\u2022\tPolitics as a second level structural theme: the emergency of the situations turn participants voices into activist, solution oriented champions, but in deeper discussions they all seek more political fairness and efficient government responses to the problem of refugees, food production, new and cooperative economies.\n\u2022\tWhile all discussions kept a critical, serious tone, none was polemic. There was rather **broad agreement** between participants on most topics. -> shared values? \n\n3)\tAre there common users across the stories? Is there a particularly active user or group of users?\nCommunity members based in Greece: especially Aravella, and Edgeryders platform team members.", "created_at": "2017-07-24 13:05:59.213339", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 16:02:49.591569", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1759, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 12.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9481, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2853, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>start small?</b>\n\nEducational problems are huge, not just in <span>Egypt </span>but across the world: from infrastructure to what we teach our children and to the need of better teachers..\n\n<span>If we stick at the diagnosis phase, we'll surely get stuck or get depressed.

So we have our first problem: local administrators (at least in Italy, don't know elsewhere) are not able to tell a data license from a copyright license (same problem in the software filed). Hence, having a TEMPORARY national license for the time being is the first step towards harmonization. \n\nSecond. I understand your doubts, Edgeryders do not directly affect extraUE decisions. However, UE has the power to start a dialogue with other countries, but UE needs \"technicians\" like us that make proposal to her. So, since the Commission is going to edit the PSI reuse directive, I agree is mandatory to discuss a European open data license, but we also have to stress it is time to think about an international one. You know internet and citizens run faster than istitutions, so the sooner we ask for an international harmonization, the sooner they could create something like the WIPO, which worked quite good for intellectual property harmonization. \n\nMy point is: let's make two recommendation, one for a European data license, one for involved the whole world by diplomacy into the harmonization issue.\n\nPS I apologize for my bad english, it's been a while since I wrote in this language last time.", "created_at": "2012-11-23 12:30:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:31.097569", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 286, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8675], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81578, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 14215, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Thanks @MariaEuler for the overview.\nI highly second your recommendation for this article, it really gets us thinking about future economic structures built around work:\n\n https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-teams-as-distributed-economic-development/14183", "created_at": "2020-08-10 06:14:59.074171", "updated_at": "2020-08-10 06:14:59.074171", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 36, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 21.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67988, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12211, "post_number": 7, "raw": "I will also go with 7. social Interactions as well as continuous writing commitments until the 31st have prevented relaxation to set in.

Then, he began the first exercise to help participants better define your project.\n\nThe most essential element in a definition is the noun, followed by mentioning the audience/market.\n\n![|602x313](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/szcyscXvfy0KVvlEYhzxDe691bOrwu5MOufkoGEmyMzh9Q0nQjT62cekTEy5u8J62Q3eZafw4IGyh7ve4dqvTfC-r1wGTsF9rMKC30xsTw77noFrsnIJHLA28v8k9C-3SNDgd-PB)\n\nThe second exercise was how to build an audience map which was indicated in the last webinar check here: https://edgeryders.eu/t/follow-up-of-the-webinar-power-pitch-storytelling/12704\n\n![|602x419](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JDxugalm9wOQvsP4FCaY4HmyTI2U2lSf_u2xBEOk07Wskmss0tfKJujLsxN5Zl1JbF4aJjbmRV42ovtwAdOJnxsmfLLC6BzCV2EmeXWXzVFc3J78MIuUNi1InCeHF87JRWQbbCkj)\n\nAfter, he insisted that the central element of the structure of the pitch/presentation is the problem:\n\n![|602x451](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/S5bRQRgE_m0GOP8Ox_zxzwPvjIADclJAx6Bf4LWBqNLdru4YyHQgeLkh7uWuSaU2g0XeOFfs3sUuuJYKVCTIDsXbULAemc4CXmEZa2juTJ0nwbF1Hnbb9IQQubtZBfIIFSXqFwEK)\n\nThen, he used some of the attendee's projects as examples to detect the problem and correct the structure of the final presentations.\n\nAs for the detailed structure of a pitch, it ought to be as the following:\n\n![|602x352](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/S1jdupe8r__6WVorh_nNTDLnfEPI2tfCfDCAs-Xu8GuS57ETbHqEj2ZRfyX1qYevSwnpfTekjdt0RCoCO9Q2BWr0A-5MyrYEiGq-ivryYchjCQzEZdLcr4A-4lKDO_QEJBFQT4wM)\n\nMainly, the Cover stands for the opening, and Magic recipe means the benefit, and \"What do you need?\" is closing and calling for action.\n\nMatteo highlighted that you need to display the business model of your project as a way to say, \"I'm going to make money this way.\"\n\nConcerning \"How will you find your users?\", it's called the go-to-market strategy, which is the plan in which the steps that will get you to your target audience/users will be identified.\n\nSince it's very unlikely that the project idea and business is unique, you need to study your competitors.\n\nRegarding the Team, it is needed to have various skills within it. Finally, there is the Timeline, which is a detailed explanation of how you're going to spend the money you're asking for to support your start-up.\n\nLater, he displayed a type of pitches as an example to illustrate its structures:\n\nCommercial pitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI\n\nTowards the end of the lab, Matteo mentioned the importance of writing down your speech. As a matter of fact, it is considered essential regarding your sales materials, the presentation, and the video to be made in the future.\n\nLast but not least, you need to retain the following these five core messages that should strike at the end of the pitch:\n\n1. There is a REAL problem out there\n\n2. We have found an AMAZING solution\n\n3. We are the BEST to create this (and I can prove\n\nthis\u2026)\n\n4.

If it helps others to understand as well, great, but I still recommend going to the sources.\n\n\n### The Borderland advice process ([source](http://wiki.theborderland.se/Advice_Process))\n\nBorderland makes advice by consensual do-ocracy.\n\n* It's do-ocracy: who does the work calls the shot. Also, there is no veto power.\n* It's consensual: when making a decision, you are expected to seek advice from (1) those who have knowledge of the matter and (2) those impacted by the decision. You are also expected to carefully consider that advice. Then, you still make the decision. \n\nThere are two versions of this. The simple version is informal. It is appropriate for decisions that do not have a systemic impact across Borderland. The formal version includes an obligation to transparency: you should make your proposal explicit; discuss how others will be impacted by it; invite questions, objections and suggestions; and address them.\n\n\n### Realities platform concept notes ([source](https://www.loomio.org/d/ySZ1xVKa/realities-platform-concept-notes))\n\nRealities is a tool meant to minimize the [bystander effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) in communities. It is conceived much like an issue tracker, but creating issues implies stewardship on the issue on the part of the creator. This contrast with common issue tracking systems, where the stewardship of the issue (called a _Need_ in Realities) goes by default to whoever assigns that issue to herself. This stewardship is a \"last resort\" one. Upon creating a Need, you become its _Guide_. Your job is not to fulfill it, but to find someone that can and will \u2013 its _Realiser_. If fulfilling that particular need requires many activities, then there will be many _Responsibilities_, one for each activity, and each Responsibility also has a Realiser. Responsibilities will often be nested: I need A to do B, and B to do C, which in turn fulfills need N. These are called _Dependencies_: C depends on B, which depends on A.\n\nRealities has two advantages over traditional issue tracking: \n\n1. No issue can ever be stewardless. This is an elegant move, that designs social incentives right into the system: you only create an issue if you care about it enough to want to steward it. Who calls the shots does the work! \n\n2. As you use it, you discover the dependency map of what you are doing. \n\nRealities also has advantages over hierarchy: Needs get matched to people that care about them, efficient in terms of use and fractionability of time, etc.", "created_at": "2018-11-17 14:32:06.773394", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 00:17:46.691349", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 438, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 58.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85621, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14654, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Seeing him today :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2020-10-23 08:02:44.398191", "updated_at": "2020-10-23 09:51:00.803327", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85618], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64882, "user_id": 5701, "topic_id": 11602, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Haha, yeah\nI like that Ravi Shankar anecdote!\nIndian classical music is still connected to the vibration of the root \nnote and as far as I know explores it's potential in a way that is true \nto the overtone series.

I see computer models as sort of parables: they contain the bare minimum to make a point.

This means imagining a world that makes two products (in Goodwin's model there is effectively only one): call them \"wheat\" and \"art\". \"Wheat\" satisfies all material needs, whereas \"art\" is what people do for fun. Assume \"art\" has no carbon footprint at all. Assume further that people get paid when they produce \"wheat\", but not when they produce \"art\". \n\nFinally, assume that how much \"wheat\" people need to satisfy their material needs depends on something in the model. We might need to introduce yet another variable. If this need is constant, capital accumulation will produce a Keynesian world of high productivity of labor in producing \"wheat\", and everybody will spend more and more of their time doing \"art\". But if the need increases fast enough, you would get people \"running to stand still\", producing more and more \"wheat\" instead of doing more \"art\".\n\nYou get the idea: you make a toy world that does not *describe* the real world, but isolates the dynamic you care about.

I am a founding member of [Modena City Ramblers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modena_City_Ramblers), which, for a time in the 1990s, was perhaps the most influential lefty band in Italy (the band still exists, I am no longer involved). \n\nThere is some resonance with some of the POPREBEL themes in that story. We attempted to deploy musical tradition (made urgent and lively with a robust injection of punk) in order to buttress progressive politics, specifically anti-fascism. Our reasoning was:\n\n* At least in the north, Italian folk music is full of rebel songs. The partisan epics during WW2 yielded some material there, but also there are songs about strikes etc. There seems to be an aspiration to social justice weaved in the culture.\n* If this is here we come from, we must be striving for social justice too, or else be inconsistent with our own roots.\n\nThis logic, underpinned by some scholarly work (for example ethnomusicologist Alessandro Portelli), did not stop the right wing separatists of [Lega Nord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord) play our music on their pet radio stations. The point *they* were trying to make is that Northern music sounds Celtic, which is why we could blend it so well with Irish materials. That \"proved\" that the north was different and needed to pull itself apart from the lazy south yada yada. We were fascinated: every time those guys played our records, two stories were competing. Which one would win out?

I bring people together in a heartfelt way and create spaces were they can be real. I ask and listen. I inspire with new viewpoints and I encourage people to question what has \u201ealways been this way&ldquo;. Verbal, physical and written communication is the core of my work. I hold a Bachelor in Intercultural Communication and I have attended numerous courses on topics of communication outside of university, such as movement, art, personal development, radical honesty, nonviolent communication and bodywork. I speak German, Englisch, French and Russian and lived abroad quiet some time.\n\nI have a strong interest to use my skills in the online world, to be able to reach even more people then I can do offline. I am actively involved in online discussions in my private life and I am familiar with trending online platforms and communities, I have used Slack as well as similar platforms to organise events and group discussions. Since about ten years I am also managing my own blog.\n\nI see the internet and most developing technologies as a unique chance to create a peaceful, healthy and equal global society. At the same time it's one of the biggest and most frightening challenges of our time. I identify with the goals of the NGI, especially in regards to the urgency of building strong moral online values and an open, human- centric and transparent foundation for the virtual world on which we can agree and act.\n\nWhenever I encounter violent, uninformed and hatred-filled comments, whether it\u00b4s on YouTube, articles, group discussions or Facebook, I try to initiate a discussion adding different viewpoints and hope to get people to reflect on their statement.\n\nIt upsets me, how much hatred and false information is spread online. At the same time I appreciate the opportunity and see the advantages that the internet provides to connect to likeminded people and to spread peaceful ideas.\n\nPeople in my network are involved in creating global online platforms using technologies to enhance community building and freedom. Most people I know would agree on the NGI goals, but I assume there are people who don't understand the necessity of this kind of project. Having said that, isn't it especially important to reach those peoples attention, that neglect the importance of creating the internet of the future in an open, human-centric transparent way?\n\nI think clear, honest and transparent communication is one of the puzzle pieces for a peaceful, flourishing and democratic society. Therefore is see this job as a unique opportunity to grow and use my skills in a meaningful way. Along with my empathy, my keen perception and my curiosity to learn something new, I see myself as a potential candidate for this position.\n\nSince I am currently freelancing, I am flexible to schedule myself to the needs of this job.\n\nExcited to hear from you, my CV is attached here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gEl13-tbzw54BcQfIg6A8_NxSVcz4Vhp/view?usp=sharing,\n\nWith regards,\n\nTheresa Neumann", "created_at": "2019-03-21 11:13:27.361279", "updated_at": "2019-03-21 11:13:27.361279", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 518, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 80.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4970, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51923, "user_id": 4956, "topic_id": 9584, "post_number": 62, "raw": "@johncoate I hope I will still be considered for the interview choices?", "created_at": "2019-03-21 11:18:35.138672", "updated_at": "2019-03-21 11:18:35.138672", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [51922], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60471, "user_id": 5201, "topic_id": 10962, "post_number": 22, "raw": "[quote=\"matthias, post:21, topic:10962\"]\nI like that route. It\u2019s also in line with the style in [Nadia\u2019s examples](/t/10962/2), and we\u2019d get material with full copyrights on our side, so we can publish it under an open source licence if we want to (as per the contract with Lorenzo). It still depends on a bright idea on the designer\u2019s side to transport the solarpunk theme with this style of illustration, but that should be possible to some degree.\n[/quote]\n\n\nAlso, big difference, we can put whatever we want (limited to already said restraints of time+budget+feasibility) in an illustration. A stock photo is croppable but not modifiable (no weird Photoshop accepted, nor by me, nor by Lorenzo). And we also want to think about all supports we could use this illustration on: a stock photo on a tshirt? No, thanks. \n\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:21, topic:10962\"]\na minimal illustration (shown left and right in the mockup) can be done as part of our contract. A bespoke illustration (center in the mockup) is way beyond the scope of this contract and would cost upwards of 2k GBP. @ilara is that what you discussed? (Just make sure we don\u2019t misunderstand our designer and get into budget related discussions in the end.)\n[/quote]\n\nThe picture in the center of the mockup is a stock photo that he cropped and put some copy on. He can do that, if we buy a stock photo that we like - the good ones are quite expensive though and the nice cheaper ones are those everybody buy - but then we come back to the previous point: not modifiable, not on every support, etc. What he says is that asking him to reproduce a 3D picture like the one in the center with our own wishlist about The Reef is impossible: he's not a 3D graphic designer, it takes a lot of time and work, much more money. \n\nSo, to sum up: I'll say to Lorenzo that we would have the illustration, minimalistic style.

I to chyba by\u0142o najgorsze. Nie to, co zrobi\u0142 Staszek, ale to, co zrobi\u0142 w\u0142a\u015bciciel firmy. Tym faktem zbulwersowany by\u0142 te\u017c m\u00f3j szef, kt\u00f3ry ostro pok\u0142\u00f3ci\u0142 si\u0119 z prezesem.

Us\u0142ysza\u0142am od niego co\u015b takiego: \u201cProsi\u0142a\u015b mnie o rekomendacj\u0119 na LinkedInie.

Przez kilka miesi\u0119cy nie podejmowa\u0142am si\u0119 \u017cadnej sta\u0142ej pracy, bior\u0105c tylko dorywcze zlecenia (w tym od firmy, z kt\u00f3rej odesz\u0142am, pracuj\u0105c z domu, i nie kontaktuj\u0105c si\u0119 ze swoim mobberem). Mobbing by\u0142 przyczyn\u0105 atak\u00f3w l\u0119kowych, a w konsekwencji rozpocz\u0119cia przyjmowania antydepresant\u00f3w. Przepracowa\u0142am sytuacj\u0119 na terapii u psychotraumatologa, a mimo to mam spi\u0119t\u0105 \u017cuchw\u0119 i ci\u0119\u017cej si\u0119 oddycha, kiedy pisz\u0119 te s\u0142owa. Wiele konkret\u00f3w zd\u0105\u017cy\u0142o si\u0119 zatrze\u0107 w mojej g\u0142owie, ale najwyra\u017aniej cia\u0142o pami\u0119ta.\n\n***\n\nMimo to, \u017ce od mojego odej\u015bcia min\u0119\u0142o kilka lat, Staszek nadal tam pracuje. Dlaczego nie walczy\u0142am w s\u0105dzie? Uzna\u0142am, \u017ce mobbing jest przemoc\u0105, kt\u00f3r\u0105 trudno udowodni\u0107, a sam proces mnie jeszcze bardziej zniszczy. Zwyczajnie nie mia\u0142am si\u0142y.\n\nJe\u017celi mam powiedzie\u0107, co z ca\u0142ej historii by\u0142o dla mnie najbardziej bolesne, to postawa w\u0142a\u015bciciela firmy (wzmocniona s\u0142owami o moim strzale w kolano), kt\u00f3ry stan\u0105\u0142 po stronie oprawcy, a mi jeszcze do\u0142o\u017cy\u0142 od siebie.\n\n***\n\nDa\u0142am ten tekst do przeczytania partnerowi, kt\u00f3ry r\u00f3wnie\u017c pracowa\u0142 dla tej firmy, i by\u0142 przy mnie, kiedy to wszystko si\u0119 dzia\u0142o. Stwierdzi\u0142, \u017ce tekst zupe\u0142nie nie oddaje tego, co si\u0119 w\u00f3wczas dzia\u0142o. \u017be mobbing opisany wcale nie wygl\u0105da gro\u017anie. I \u017ce chyba nie da si\u0119 tego przekaza\u0107 s\u0142owami \u2013 trzeba do\u015bwiadczy\u0107 przemocy psychicznej i (co wa\u017cne) u\u015bwiadomi\u0107 sobie, \u017ce jest to przemoc, \u017ceby zrozumie\u0107, co si\u0119 wtedy dzia\u0142o ze mn\u0105 i wok\u00f3\u0142 mnie. Kiedy sama to czytam, mnie te\u017c historia wydaje si\u0119 banalna. Obawiam si\u0119, \u017ce taka wydaje si\u0119 przemoc psychiczna i jej skutki.

I set up a campaign that ran for one week, with 1 regular tweet (visible on the account) and two promoted-only tweets (would have been seen just by the people who saw the ad). I stripped all info about the costs and just left the three ads in the image below and their respective click rates. \n\nFirst of all, it's clear that people reacted better to general tweets than to the tweet that somehow assumed that the viewer is more familiarised with the activity (the one about this workshop being the 3rd in the series). I wanted to add that the 3rd tweet was added last, after a few days, so even if it has the 2nd nr of clicks, still it did comparatively better in the time it was up. So maybe not having hashtags in the promoted tweet helps. \n\nThe number of impressions was pretty good (12.604), but the click through rate was bad (0.25%). On other ads I ran for other accounts, I was used to click through rates above 1%. 1.15% was quite average, but some of them even had around 3%. From @noemi 's data, none of the 32 clicks on the page resulted in registrations to the workshop.\n![results%20tweet%20campaign|690x383](upload://jKkoztaO2bF6IGBAh8HcUKwSiy2.png) \nThe lessons that I got out of it?\n1. Twitter is a great way to target very specific people (by keyword, topic, whom they follow)\n2. It works well for information campaigns but less so for actual call to actions, if these aren't very clear and easy to follow\n3. Write copy that reads easy and does not assume previous knowledge of the subject.\nSo I would say good for the awareness phase of projects. \n\n@noemi, do you have anything else to add about this?", "created_at": "2019-12-02 12:44:23.313228", "updated_at": "2019-12-02 12:44:23.313228", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 358, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 42.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [66091], "is_liked_by": [4, 4451], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50669, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9468, "post_number": 4, "raw": "[quote=\"adz, post:3, topic:9468\"]\nThe backend is configured through the database now, I will look into the web application now, as this requires some more changes (the application has to fetch the config through a new API endpoint).\n[/quote]\n\nReally nice reworking!

Make it easy for us to promote it:\n   * Give @MariaEuler photos/visuals + statements/quotes she can use to customise design for a flyer and for a header for this event (as part of the festival)\n3. See what you think of this approach to one on one outreach for getting good input to help you develop the session, and the broader discussion you wish to build around the topics of your fellowship:\n   * You send emails with to people you think can contribute to this discussion with personalised invitation using content from the one I forwarded you as a template/model\n   * If they agree you can forward them to a member of Edgeryders staff (@inge for now) who then does the interview &amp; transcribes content, and helps them to get on platform. You would need to agree with her on what questions you would like to ask\u2026\n4. Read the articles posted by the contributers and write a summary.

So we keep the \"Tag view\" and \"List of User Annotations\" tabs. The \"Tag view\" tab could be extended to also allow reorganizing the tag hierarchy and adding tags on-the-fly, as required by Inga. There could be another tab added for the quotation manager (\"search by tag\"), but that probably better goes into a global \"advanced search\" page. The main benefits of eComma are: providing much of the basic architecture we'd have to create anyway (taxonomy interfacing, theming, storage) and providing organizational architecture to reduce our share of later maintenance and issue fixing costs (they are an institutionally funded open source project from the higher education area).\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-19 15:00:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:02.567515", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 272, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7005], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81361, "user_id": 6484, "topic_id": 13988, "post_number": 92, "raw": "\n\n[quote=\"amelia, post:90, topic:13988\"]\nI identified that the process you describe (the selection of other people\u2019s codes while coding) was happening on a call with Wojciech rather than anything \u2018automagic\u2019 and explained it to him, but he also thought there was an actual \u2018automagic\u2019 process going on prior to his setting his user settings to the ethno poprebel tag \u2014 @Wojt can you confirm and describe, please, if this is still happening?\n[/quote]\n\n@matthias @amelia\nAs far as I remember the issue was indeed there. \nFor now blessed be your explanation and suggestion for a possible way of fixing the issue raised, @matthias!.\n(And I used the word \"merging\" because the result was or seemed identical to the result of using the merge function)\nI rest my case. \nFor good it seems.\nThanks again!\n\n[quote=\"amelia, post:91, topic:13988\"]\nMy hope is that once we merge codes on Thurs we also create a unified codebook that we use from here on out (and that we will all ultimately spend more time on the POPREBEL codes list than our own!)

We follow their (positive) responses via email template which directs them to the dedicated form on the platform. There they can register for the event and meet the Edgeryders at the same time. Following the initiative, we contact them and propose the follow-up meeting to discuss possible collaborations.\n* This system can be successfully used for POPREBEL campaigns with personalised messages in the languages of various countries, but we need local people leading the projects to use their personal Linkedin accounts to that end.\n\n* **Research** : on the [Supervisory Board Meeting](https://edgeryders.eu/t/supervisory-board-meeting-general-assembly-25-9-minutes/14464/1) on the 25 September 2020 the doubts were expressed on our capacity to deliver \"the shadows of the populism\". Following the lines discussed on the [previous meeting](https://edgeryders.eu/t/notes-from-the-team-biweekly-23-9/14447), we are hiring journalists to interview people on **safety** and **politics.** In order to render this content as rich as possible for the ethnographers' data collection:\n  * conversations and not surveys must be created\n  * on the biweekly ethnographers meetings will be discussed the threads that may be interesting to explore\n  * active conversations will be tagged and prioritised\n  * we need to find a way to collect conversations from the higher levels of society also\n  * we introduce new topics \u2013 health: covid & consequences, neofeudalism \u2013 the Hungarian discussion\n  * we need to render the people from the consortium more present on the platform as experts and moderators\n\n* **Community management:** we continue on producing interviews in original language. In parallel with the journalists' work, community managers will be reactive and concerned with what people have already said. This way they can produce a story and give flesh and bones to the people involved, asking questions not only on what one's project/organisation is, but how it started, what were the challenges, which the effects of the political environment, funding etc.\n  * There is a lot of \u201cmanual\u201d work going on \u2013 filtering interest and sending invitations.\n  * @wolha is exploring the possibility to include Magdalena H. Goralska, a digital anthropologist from Poland https://anthrocovid.com/1-2/contributions-from-poland/.\n\n* **Tech:** @matthias and @hugi are starting to work on the new version of the Graphryder, which will still relay on the Horizon 2020 project.\n  * @owen is working on the collection of info through forms on the platform. It is important that he sees it through.\n\n18:00 The meeting is adjourned, a video registration will be kept for some time if necessary on the Zoom cloud.\n\n*Soundtrack from the beginning:* [ *Khruangbin - So We Won't Forget* ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo4KMGiy--Y)", "created_at": "2020-10-08 08:57:35.301674", "updated_at": "2020-10-08 09:13:41.247462", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 527, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 118.6, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4096, 4934, 3, 8, 3622, 4, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62831, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11185, "post_number": 3, "raw": "hi Do you have an image/ banner for promoting this event?", "created_at": "2019-11-03 08:55:03.197223", "updated_at": "2019-11-03 08:55:03.197223", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65757, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 11395, "post_number": 22, "raw": "By now we have multiple shares on some of the big groups for women, No Problem - they were just featured by Vogue Poland as the hottest place in town - prepared a free poster for us and printed it and placed around the area.

For example, I have been told \"Why all this math for a date?\" (implication: do you no longer love me? Are these incomprehensible numbers going to tell you whether I can see you or not?). And I have been in calls where people obsessed a lot about \"The Rules\" given by the Belgian govt, with very little thoughts of how the govt might be getting it wrong, or have secondary objectives other than people's overall health. And almost no turning to the scientific literature. In the poly microcosm there is an authoritarian streak: \"follow the rules! stay at home!\" \n\nBut again, that is everywhere, not just with us.

Also, here are some keywords to stick to:\n> \n> * community\n> \n> Since it's a co-housing + co-working aiming to be carbon neutral or maybe positive, a focus is to represent multiplicity. People of different kind are the desirable inhabitants of The Reef. This could be represented as 3+ hands (following the first sketch you sent us) or in the way you prefer. Please, keep in mind diversity (ethnicity, gender, ability, ...).\n> \n> * nature-dominated\n> \n> The Reef wants to grow nature in and outside of it. Lush flora is a must.\n> \n> * techno-positive\n> \n> We imagine a world where technology is a tool for a better living, not for oppression, control or addiction.\n> \n> * futuristic\n> \n> Be inspired by [this image](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b805e448ee97631517ee9e5b5db9a518ddce4713.jpeg).\n> \n> * pleasant\n> \n> Communal living can easily be stressful. Our way of imagining it is a pleasant balance between privacy and social relations, where people try to have a positive impact one on the other.\n> \n> * solarpunk-y\n> \n> Be inspired by [this image](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1746fa509d335283f48e743c2fc244e062933edc.jpeg). \n> \n> * city integrated\n> \n> The Reef, as the thing it takes the name from, is not an island (well, you know what I mean ;) ). It's integrated in the ecosystem around it. So, the city of Brussels has to be represented in some way - as skyline around The Reef, using Bxl typical architectural elements as part of The Reef (windows or roofs), you name it.\n> \n> * geodetic + round shapes\n> \n> As you did in your first sketch, geodetic elements and round shapes are required. Also, please let The Reef have some strange shape using these elements. It has to be a house, but not a classic one.\n> \n> Colours: as in solarpunk style, please use mainly blue, green, grey (metal) and brown.

In short, they are a **Belgian-based, globally-active social innovation agency** who collaborate on designing concrete solutions to societal challenges. With an impressive cross-section of programmes, projects and resources, they work across **care, sustainability, new learning (and future economies), superdiversity, global development and community building**.\n\nThey employ design thinking, such as  **human-centred design and appreciative inquiry** to come up with concrete results and outputs ranging from **interventions, toolkits, business models, policy suggestions, products** and others... I highly encourage you to explore their projects here and no doubt @anna_idrops can respond to and connect any of your interests with their work.  \n\nThere are a few potential areas of collaboration that could be interesting, and I\u2019ll be meeting with Anna and Nathalie again this week, as well as their colleague Hendrikje the week after next to dive further into tangible partnership pathways. For now I'd like to explore two specific possibilities:\n\n* I\u2019m particularly interested in leveraging !Drops experience in **creative and design labs to prototype ideas and create blueprints to make projects sustainable**.  These \u201cEnergy labs\" engage specific target groups and their innovation trajectories to develop new products and services with tangible results. They share our principles of open knowledge and goal of fostering self-sustaining projects and have done these across diverse contexts including recently with young social innovators in Malawi and artisans in Colombia. I'll be further exploring this with their project lead on global development Hendrikje in a couple of week's time. In the meantime, @anna_idrops - is there anywhere we can access an example programme for one of these labs to reference?\n\n* **[Summer School with University of Antwerp 2 - 6 July 2018](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/summer-schools/product-service-design-in-healthcare/programme/in-a-nutshell/)**. This has short lead-time (applications close 15/05) but could be an appropriate start. !Drops with their partners at the University of Antwerp and the Service Design Network are hosting a **five-day summer school program on product, service and system design in health care**, accompanied by a coaching trajectory. With 25 participants from all over the world, the ultimate goal is to give participants concrete tools through explorations in: Digital storytelling and new media in the medical context/ Human Centered Design and caregiving/ Creative industries and care/ Thematic sessions on psychiatry, neighbourhood care and migration and care/ Personal wellbeing in work and daily life. @anna_idrops and I had talked about the possibility of opening up **a scholarship place to one of our OpenVillage MENA network** (registration is EUR250 for students/ EUR450 for professionals + travel costs). Obviously with such short lead time we\u2019re constrained but I think something like **scholarship = 1 x place fees waived by !Drops + travel costs incorporated into an existing opportunity by Edgeryders** could potentially work. What do you think @nadia and @anna_idrops? \nThey are also interested in the possibility of a presentation on OPENCARE as a case study on day four (5 July). I thought this could be interesting and enjoyable for you @noemi - might you be around and keen?\n\nCurious to hear any other thoughts - @matteo_uguzzoni you may find their work with refugees of interest for example - and will continue to share here as the conversations continue.", "created_at": "2018-04-30 12:55:46.655930", "updated_at": "2018-05-02 15:50:22.040053", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 561, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 114.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4085, 4265, 3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62550, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11193, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Wow, @katejsim, what a post! I had managed to miss it. Very, very interesting work. As far as I can tell, there are two main threads here.\n\nThe first is that the Internet's architecture facilitates collective action. This is true for the good action of the anti-harassment activists, but also for the bad action of cyberharassers:\n\n \n\n[quote=\"katejsim, post:1, topic:11193\"]\nI realized there were many communities of misogynist men who would actively track the discourse on sexual violence, and then directlytarget young activists who became national figureheads. They\u2019d constantly barrage us, saying we were liars, or that we didn\u2019t know what we were talking about. [...] **It\u2019s built into the design of the Internet we have today, and until we change the platforms, it\u2019s only gonna get worse**.\n[/quote]\n\nThe second thread is one I am more familiar with: understanding data. Like all data, reporting data are not a a faithful reconstruction of the phenomenon underpinning them (harassment), but just one, very partial, proxy for that phenomenon. And, like all data, they carry the risk of shifting all the attention onto the proxy, and away from the thing itself. We make what we measure, and if we measure reporting, we will end up acting only on what is being reported. \n\nBoth these threads, I believe, are relevant to a discussion on a new Internet of humans. \n\nFor the first one, I have a curiosity: how did people in the anti-harassment movement, like yourself, respond to the discovery that the Internet was both empowering them *and* putting them under pressure? Were people calling for more policing of the Internet? Or dreaming to go all crypto, and take solace in anonymity? Or what? \n\nFor the second one, what I read in your post is a promising effect and a warning. The promising effect is that, it I understand correctly, people are more likely to report harassment episodes if they do it online. But even here, how can we be sure that the increased likelihood is not a function of the credibility of the follow-up downstream of reporting? After  all, you yourself point out that many people are mistrustful of institutions; a highly structured Internet funnel might offer some more guarantees, as caseloads and queues of people processing reports are monitored. If a report lands in your inbox, and is not processed in a reasonably short time, you will surely hear from your manager!\n\nAnd the warning is, of course, that what you are looking at here is not reporting of harassment, but harassment itself. And plenty of it happens even in the absence of reporting: we ned to make sure we do not lose track of that. \n\nAm I reading your correctly? What are your thoughts on my questions?", "created_at": "2019-10-30 15:07:39.058045", "updated_at": "2019-10-30 15:07:39.058045", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 466, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 54.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [61746], "is_reply_to": [61746], "is_liked_by": [4934, 1856, 5479], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71706, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14294, "post_number": 8, "raw": "hey John can you copy your comment here? https://edgeryders.eu/t/do-you-want-to-join-our-covid19-community-response-a-breakdown-of-edgeryders-activities-roles-tasks-and-workflows/12879", "created_at": "2020-03-18 22:47:10.461323", "updated_at": "2020-08-24 08:49:56.793178", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [71705], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49154, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 9267, "post_number": 6, "raw": "[quote=\"hugi, post:4, topic:9267\"]Perhaps something new comes up in the next three years [\u2026] while involving a completely different set of people.

That was an open source laptop that could even be powered up with a hand crank.  It was designed to be as disruptive as it was useful.  The Director of the project was former Media Lab Director Walter Bender (Nadia and I know him pretty well - and he is still a friend.)\n\nIn 2007 or 8 I was in Cambridge on a job interview. I visited Walter in his OLPC office.  I knew the project was struggling but wasn't clear on why.  He told me that when they arranged with Ecuador and one neighboring country, maybe Peru, not sure, to bring a big number of those laptops to the kids in those countries Microsoft and Dell both went to the leadership of those countries and told them straight out that if they do not abandon the OLPC project completely, Microsoft and Dell (and who know what other companies, but those two for sure) told them that they would no longer support the government offices that rely on Office and Dell computers.  I'm sure you can guess what happened next - OLPC was denied 100% by those countries.  The chilling effect was pervasive and was a big part of killing the project.\n\nThose guys do not screw around.

And we have come to the conclusion, we will be holding more follow-up events delving further into the recovery of the coworking sector.\n\nOur coworking event held on July 21st was a great success with between 40 and 50 people from all over the world joining in to hear coworking space owners, technology providers and network organisers gathered to discuss some of the challenges ahead.\n\nJoin in the [conversation here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-teams-as-distributed-economic-development/14183), started by one of our speakers John O\u2019Duinn. He gives a good summary on what\u2019s changed over the past few years in the world of work that has and will continue to enable employees to work remotely - something which, he argues, will have a positive impact on coworking spaces.\n\nIf you feel like digging a little deeper feel free to browse [our recovery forum](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/coworking-recovery/364) and you will find [nuggets like this ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/can-coworking-burst-small-world-complacency/14032)from Faye Alund, the chief executive and co-founder of Kampul, a co-learning platform, and president of coworking Indonesia association. His story is an interesting one as he has worked for an organization that builds ecosystems through coworking spaces.\n\nWe have also been thinking alot about the link between the global pandemic and surveillance. One of our latest posts discusses how the government of Romania has decided to translate its entire database of clinical data treated by the health authorities to its ministry of internal affairs.

[A post about this can be found around the campfire](https://edgeryders.eu/t/software-at-ecovillage-sieben-linden-workshop-venue-management/9637), and @hugi proposed that I could go more into detail here (Participio). \n\nThe [awesome list compile by matthias](https://edgeryders.eu/t/open-source-software-for-resource-scheduling-and-booking/6629) doesnt hit the nail yet.\n\n**The business**\n\nOur association offers _workshops_ (or seminars, never sure about the correct wording) usually of multiple days length, in a complete package (with _accommodation_ and _food_).\n\n_Participants_ register online but usually the whole process involves mails or other communication (e.g. because too many people want a double-bed room, but we only have X) until the registration is settled.\n\nMultiple teams provide the respective services (managing the offer, seminars and hosts, preparing the rooms for accomodation, taking care of the camping ground, cooking, answering general inquiries, bookkeeping ...).\n\nBesides that, we also rent out our infrastructure and have groups e.g. coming for an educational offer (like a guided tour with the focus on building strawbale houses or permaculture) with a meal included. The case of a single visitor staying over night like in a hotel is very rare, we usually do not want to accomodate that use case (don't ask here - but there is some good reasons for why we usually don't do that).\n\nFor the numbers: I would say we have around 50 public seminars and 7000 guest-nights per year.\n\n**The Software**\n\nSo far we use a self-built inhouse solution that totally uses the wrong tooling (a document-based database: couchdb and a embeddable scripting language: lua). It is a web-based solution, picks up the registrations from our public webserver, allows the teams to specify and publish new seminars, rearrange accommodation rooms, show overview calender etc. Some tools around it also allow for specific views (for the most part, they just read the database) or the proposal of new events.\n\nBtw, we need to have this inhouse because of a traditionally unstable internet-connection.\n\nHowever it does not integrate with the book-keeping software at all and is also not able to print receipts for the visitors or stuff like that. Besides, its not really technically multi-user and has some other issues.\nStill, all in all for what it is it works great and does this since 7 years. But its time for a change, where some issues are properly adressed (like semi-automatic participant-data- anonymization according to the GDPR, proper event room calendars, proper \"Team-\" views, a history of changes done to the data, a proper User- and authorization concept, better synchronisation to our website, ...).\n\n**And now, and you?**\n\nWe will evaluate different possibilities and offers.\n\nMy personal, favorite solution would be to build a small business to host and develop that kind of (obviously Free) software (in Ruby on Rails), but 1) it ain't easy and 2) it is not really only me to decide what path \"we\" (the ecovillage Sieben Linden) will take.\n\nIf you have experience with any tools, know somebody with similar problems or solutions, got a clever funding idea or want to help or visit an ecovillage and know some tech (preferably Ruby on Rails), post here or write me a private message.", "created_at": "2019-03-21 11:33:40.543144", "updated_at": "2019-08-04 00:17:19.603344", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 573, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 264.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4, 4795, 4085], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69936, "user_id": 5538, "topic_id": 12409, "post_number": 17, "raw": "In a moment of \u201cout of curiosity\u201d I ran though my [local districts](https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/education/k12/content/anglophone_sector/curriculum_anglophone.html) curriculum to see if there were any opportunities that would lend themselves as openings for using open source tools.  This is partially due to the fact that while I know the equivalent exists in Sweden, my swedish skills are pretty loose.  This was also to see if this problem has been solved elsewhere :wink: \n\nThe takeaway from this quick check is there is most of the goals and outcomes are pretty much in the 3-r category; reading writing and arithmetic \u2014 with a foundational text overlying outcomes at https://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/ed/pdf/K12/curric/TechnologyVocational/TechnologyEducation.pdf for the broader region.\n\nA few items that are very interesting from this latter document:\n* They have applied a competence model (see page 5.)\n* No technology is proscribed, but the actions are (ibid.)\n* Ethical dilemmas are highlighted.

But this requires a lot of work and we don't have unlimited resources with which to do this.\n\n<strong>So how do we make smart decisions about how to make the best use of our limited attention, time and money on social media for OpenCare?</strong>\n\nIt is my belief that our first move ought to be\u00a0<strong>setting the foundations for data-driven decision making</strong>. The reason being that if we have a consistent and transparent way for everyone involved to evaluate the results of different outreach efforts, we can adopt the ones that generate good results and skip the ones that don't. Over time we all improve our knowledge (and can share our documentation with others who also wish to learn).\u00a0\n\nThis means:\n\n<em>i) <strong>Defining our approach towards analytics</strong></em>\n\n<em>ii) <strong>Defining the data that we need</strong></em>\n\n<em>iii)<strong> Building a process to collect those data</strong> (and a nice dashboard)</em>\n\nTo begin with I am more or less browsing at random to discover some new ways to go about doing the above. Also, I'm upgrading my skills by enrolling in a Mooc (<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/marketing-analytics\">Digital Analytics for Marketing Professionals: Marketing Analytics in Theory</a>).\n\nMaybe you have experience doing this kind of thing and have some advice to share or would like to get involved somehow?

This experience is affecting me in many ways, even if I am not a woman... I work in Venice with migrants and I lead workshops in secondary school talking about migrations, prejudices, stereotypes and racism. Actually this experience is giving me more and more inspirations mainly because we have a collective way of work. Topics and sessions are inspired by women and we as \"joker\" can suggest or propose something but always starting from the real oppressions (big or small) that the women want to face...\n\nAbout the self-perception of the oppression it is a very complex topic. According to my experience, I can see that the women are very aware that they live daily many oppressions but some of them consider them as a \"burden\" that they have to bring with them. The hardest point is the step to do when they have to change their husbands' behaviours: some of them think that it is possible, some of them not. But I guess that we are getting some result because in some scenes we show husbands' behaviour and some of the women are going on with this experience even if their husbands don't agree.\n\nIn general, Forum Theatre's power is that it can act both towards actors and spect-actors so what we try to do is to walk both roads keeping in mind that it is necessary to start from women's oppressions.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-10 11:36:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:01.769696", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 250, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}]
