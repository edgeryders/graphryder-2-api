As well as to set the foundation for effective community responses to future crises. Please feel free to add your comments below with proposals/questions etc add things you see are missing etc. OR even put yourself forward to take one of the roles on yourself already now. The idea here is to make space for anyone and everyone who wants to contribute in a way that works for them!*** \n\n# Add a nice title here\n\nThis is a call for a team of people who can together build and run great communication campaigns to help us ensure that the activities manage to reach and engage the needed audience for them to meet their objectives.\n\nThe background to this work is that there are different teams working on different activities which will require different kinds of communication efforts. What they all have in common is that they are aimed at improving our ability to collectively respond to the ongoing pandemic crises, as well as to future ones. \n\nThere are three different kinds of campaigns:\n\n1. Campaigns to engage people to shape and join online activities like collaboration sprints or hackathons. Each online activity is designed and launched whenever we are asked for help from those working \u201cin the field\u201d to tackle the crisis.\n2. Campaigns to engage people to contribute high-quality content on topics aimed to help people connect the dots between different topics, activities and sources information. In order to make sense of the current situation and its implications. With a view to learn from what is happening now, to define concrete actions that we can take to better prepare us for future crises. \n3. Campaigns to draw financial and nonfinancial support to finance projects and activities (Crowdfunding campaigns, Client/funding/Sponsorship Lead generation, Sales of tickets to online events). Many important initiatives are cronichally under-resourced which threatens their ability to achieve impact at scale.  So we leverage our capacity as large distributed network of people to help them get the word out to people who can help them the support they need.\n\nEach campaign is expected to last 3 months. The communication team will coordinate with the organisers of the activities and producers of the content on our online workspace. All communication material  are to be presented to the other teams on the online workspaces ahead of publication for 24 hrs so that community members can comment/make proposals for changes etc. The final decisions about use of materials, design of campaigns will be made by Edgeryders community managers so as to avoid \u201cgetting stuck\u201d. however this will be done in close consultation with the community of collaborators around the initiatives:  \n\nSo as to enable decentralised work, the communications team will deliver on a running basis all the communication materials produced, including editable design files, to an online repository provided by Edgeryders.\n\n1. The conception of a social media strategy for the campaign\n2. Content creation for the campaign\n3. Animation and moderation of The projects\u2019 social networks and the Project\u2019s account on the Edgeryders.eu Platform\n4. Setting up and running the [curation rotation program for the Edgeryders social media accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_Curation) to connect the campaign with the Edgeryders organisation online presence\n\nScope of responsibilities\n\n1 - The creation of a social media strategy for the campaign which includes:\n\n* Proposal of editorial lines for six types of content to in this list:\n  * Thematic infographics (event calendar)\n  * Featured articles and discussion threads from the edgeryders.eu platform\n  * Portraits of selected individuals as part of the activities\n  * Promotion of \u201cgoodies/rewards\u201d such as posters\n  * Acknowledgement of community hero of the week\n  * Calls for contribution of input (crowdsourcing information)\n\n* Definition of an editorial calendar validated by the teams organising the activities that are being promoted through the campaign\n* Uploading, creation and dissemination of content according to the editorial plan validated beforehand with the team running the activities for which the campaign is intended to draw engagement:\n\n2 - The administration and management of the campaigns social profiles, which are:\n\n* Linkedin Page\n* Facebook fan page\n* Twitter account\n* Account on the Edgeryders.eu platform\n\n3 - Active one on one outreach to super-connectors on social media\n\n* Produce a list of \u201cleads\u201d for individuals who are especially relevant active in the context of thematics and activities that the campaign is promoting, and have a large audience\n* Reach out to them on a one to one basis and inform them about/invite them to participate in the activity\n\n# Paid vs unpaid work\n\nEach activity will have a communication budget of X Eur attached to it. These are solidarity funds intended to support volunteers who really want to be involved but cannot otherwise participate. It is up to each  team to decide together how to allocate those resources. The funds have different requirements for how they can be spent  as defined by the rules of the funding sources - the designated community manager and administration assistant for each will know what they are. *We need a nice document for shared management of the budget that makes it easier for us to be compliant with the funding sources! Help @Marina?*\n\n# How the work will be organised\nTo keep things simple and fun we will keep the communication team for each project limited to do 3 people who work together. The teams will also have access to designers, copywriters, video makers and others who are on standby to quickly produce any needed communication materials requested by the team. The team will be expected to self organise the work - but will have support from an experienced Edgeryders community manager who can help show how we have done things in the past and where to find materials etc, tech support to help do things like set up minisites etc.\n \n# How to join the team\nFill in this form where you will be asked a bit about yourself and pick a time for a call where you can meet the rest of the teams: *We need to make a simple form form people to fill in - who can help with this?*", "created_at": "2020-04-06 08:23:14.295364", "updated_at": "2020-04-08 09:37:17.515678", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1044, "wiki": true, "reads": 10, "score": 52.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6387], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54419, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10062, "post_number": 1, "raw": "At Edgeryders, we keep meeting people like you.

In fact, those who could afford to do so have kept climbing during the crisis \u2013 using Master/Phds as \u201cwaiting rooms\u201d while they were unemployed, and using their parent\u2019s homes &amp; support as \u201cwaiting rooms\u201d to avoid paying a premium on the crisis (i.e. high interest loans, flat evictions, etc). They\u2019ve accumulated social &amp; financial capital that provides a cushion. Those, however who were encouraged to leave school and go straight into the boom industries like construction, now have no industry or education to fall back onto and for the most part, given their parents were also employed in boom industries, they have no financial / support cushion either.\n\nWhat struck both of us was the irony of the situation, that people talk about the need to re-focus on the real economy (\u201cmaking stuff\u201d) to avoid a future boom &amp; bust. Yet those with the skills to \u201cmake &amp; build stuff\u201d are not only at a disadvantage because their industries have crashed, but because they haven\u2019t accumulated enough educational capital to compete even for jobs that haven\u2019t required this (most barman in Barcelona are graduates).\n\nThe Center for New Work, West Norwood Feast &amp; Access Space are all examples of mobilising skills which involve \u201cmaking stuff\u201d so perhaps for this to coalesce into something serious is to create these spaces in communities which have been dependent on manual industries which have since died and find a way of supporting not just young people to develop &amp; resource these spaces, but their families too? (Some areas like in ex-mining villages have kept a community self-resourcing approach as a result of young people &amp; families working together, but many areas don\u2019t have this)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-02-06 10:12:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:25.122338", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 345, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 504, "user_id": 3250, "topic_id": 471, "post_number": 1, "raw": "How can we integrate non-germans by motivating germans to teach them more about their culture / lenguage?\n\nInspiration:\n\n<strong><small class=\"noclass\"><code class=\"content-output\">\"If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.</code></small></strong>\n\n<strong><small class=\"noclass\"><code class=\"content-output\">If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart\"\u00a0</code></small></strong>\n\n<strong><small class=\"noclass\"><code class=\"content-output\">Nelson Mandela </code></small></strong>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-09 21:09:48", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 05:34:17.370251", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 102, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34988, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6748, "post_number": 3, "raw": "@noemi that's right!", "created_at": "2017-08-28 21:32:21.194754", "updated_at": "2017-08-28 21:32:21.194754", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 3.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [34877], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63505, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 11022, "post_number": 52, "raw": "Yes from my side.

Way back in the \u201980s, we wanted everything to be free because we were hippie socialists. But we also loved entrepreneurs because we loved Steve Jobs.

But that\u2019s the kind of absurdity that Silicon Valley culture has to grapple with.\n> \n> And there\u2019s only one way to merge the two things, which is what we call the advertising model, where everything\u2019s free but you pay for it by selling ads. But then because the technology gets better and better, the computers get bigger and cheaper, there\u2019s more and more data \u2014 what started out as advertising morphed into continuous behavior modification on a mass basis, with everyone under surveillance by their devices and receiving calculated stimulus to modify them. So you end up with this mass behavior-modification empire, which is straight out of Philip K. Dick, or from earlier generations, from *1984* .\n> \n> It\u2019s this thing that we were warned about. It\u2019s this thing that we knew could happen. Norbert Wiener, who coined the term *cybernetics* , warned about it as a possibility.

I work as a freelance journalist in Berlin, and in the last 2-3 years I started cooperating with a network called The Dive (thedive.com), just around the corner from where I live. What they do is development of organisations. The keyword is &lsquo;new work&rsquo;, where you can find new methods of working together, or of organising oneself. I did a lot of PR work for them, but left last year in June. One of the colleagues there, Benedikt is now leaving, and that&rsquo;s why the project is ending..\n\nhttps://www.badstrasse-quartier.de/images/Fotos/2018/10_Oktober/dive/IMG_3304.jpg\n\n**He and I had this conversation about how beautiful our neighborhood is, were it not for the waste in the streets. We have decided we are going to clean up once a week. To make it realistic, we said we take 30mins. We did it for quite some time, before lunch, Mondays and Tuesdays, and always had quite some bags of waste, but also people joining us.**\n\nWe talked to the cafes in the street, with a dance event place for contemporary dance workshops, and with neighborhood management.\n\nYou have a lot of unemployed, junkies around in our neighborhood. You only notice it some of the streets, with so much waste lying around. We realised what was necessary was deeper work. It&rsquo;s about education, going into the schools and the homes of people, involving them in getting a feeling for their own environment, and not stopping at their doorstep.\n\nWe also realised they have other problems and it&rsquo;s hard to have this particular awareness.\n\nWhat we did next was to talk to an elementary school with a lot of Capri-Sun bags around it (famous lemonade drink in small plastic bags). We thought maybe it&rsquo;s also the kids we should be talking to. We got in contact with teachers, who were very open to cooperate with us.\n\nThere was this local [waste organisation in Berlin](http://nebenan.de) who is responsible from the City, they have a small initiative where people say &lsquo;I want to clean up&rsquo; and they give you the tools to work with. It&rsquo;s a mini facebook for your neighborhood and you log in and ask for help, ask for tools etc. A digital form of community management.\n\nWe announced cleanups in whatsapp and slack, for The Dive and in the end where quite a big group:.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7GMyQFkm-8\n\nThat was our last big cleaning action. After that, Benedikt and I had a talk. We had really enjoyed the work with everybody who got involved, but the network that we were coming from wasn&rsquo;t as involved as we would have needed them to be. There was little response, and a not equal situation because Benedikt was fully employed there and I did the whole project pro bono. It didn&rsquo;t work for me: either we do it both for free, or both get paid. We said we take a rest and get together after winter.\n\nWhen I realised that we weren&rsquo;t gonna continue (we both ended up leaving the company meanwhile), I was thinking of who can I continue the work - but there isn&rsquo;t anyone in the neighborhood that I know who has the time or is on eye level with me, whom I can work with.\n\n**The approach we had was &lsquo;don&rsquo;t complain and do it yourself&rsquo;.**\n\nThe waste project was solving different issues: on one side, the City is responsible for cleanup in a different way, not so efficiently, and on the other hand, the people living here don&rsquo;t know about the spaces where they can leave that trash or they just don&rsquo;t give a shit. Those are the two poles, don&rsquo;t know or don&rsquo;t feel responsible. I think that if we had done it longer and kept going, we would have gotten to the point to say okay, we need change on a broader level. For example, for the [Quartiersmanagement ](https://www.badstrasse-quartier.de/quartiersmanagement/artikel/349-ein-riesenstaubsauger-fuer-den-kiez)a clean neighborhood is top concern this year, they have subsidies and you can get money if you apply.\n\n**I learned about how much work it is, this community work. Finding the motivation again and again is the most difficult part. That work is Sisyphus.** You have to do it every couple of days. I have great respect for those who do this all the time, you need to have a lot of intrinsic motivation. You&rsquo;re either not paid at all, or paid very badly. It&rsquo;s not about the money though. I really enjoyed getting in contact with the people, now I feel more connected with where I live.

I have always had them coming to me and asking for help with that, so I thought Okey, why not launch an incubator! not for start ups, but for the organizations / associations and help their ideas become a more impactful actions! and in the future we will work on start ups as well! \n**Why working on the Open Village Spaces?**\n\nWhat if we have a network of changemaking spaces in the regions that wants to change their reality? Moving all together, supporting each other ? now if we speak about working on the MENA region, helping the social movement, and when we have a group of spaces moving together, can you imagine the impact of that? so this is not an activity or an event that would be funded once and then it is over, this is rather a link that can stand there for years, and that can reach thousands of people at the same time in the MENA region as a whole! so if we think numbers, if we think impact: that is BIG. \n\n**The Resources:**\n\n* The Hackerspace:\n\n1.

I understand that there is are sensible distinctions to be drawn between, for example, addressing lack of shelter (homelessness/houselessness) and what is more traditionally thought of as \"healthcare,\" but I also speak from experience when I say that the stress of being unsheltered is right up there as one of the worst kinds of stress along with the stress of having a more concrete \"health issue.\"\n\nIn what ways do the more foundational elements of human care fit into Woodbine's vision for \"holistic\" healthcare? Collaborations with shelters and food rescue drives? A culture of hospitality? All of the above?

What are you working on and why are you on the Internet Days?**\n\nI am a woman, 50 years. Lives in J\u00e4mtland. Works in a library. We train ourselves, in all libraries, to become more digital. Especially this day \"digital first\" that we are here for. Was here yesterday too.\n\nIn digitalisation, I work on a project where we as librarians turn to elderly residents and people in the municipality who do not have easy access to libraries and information. This project includes providing digital assistance to people in the municipality. Is a bit part of that too.\n\n**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**\n\nYesterday actually. I was in on this one about what everything digital does to our brains. At all the lectures I attended yesterday they had a red thread. We must begin to control our use. It feels hopeful. I have children, two teenage girls. As a parent, you are desperate. There have been no control functions before. Now it is beginning to emerge that we must do nothing but be connected.\n\nWhen you hear about the internet in the future, you feel the fear that cars will drive themselves and that you should almost think that the lamp lights itself. Then I think things have gone too far. We won't be  human beings in the end.\n\n**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**\n\nIt is, in fact, when it comes to my children. The school should take more responsibility for internet use. It should be a subject in school. Today, the children have their mobile phones, are on the internet all school days. When you hear the lectures here, you understand that it disturbs our brains when we need to be connected. I'm afraid of that at all.\n\nSelf-driving cars and lamps that are switched on automatically ... It is already like that when you go in Stockholm with Google maps. You depend on the internet. Don't think it's good in the long run that we don't do anything. We need to be active. In the end, we have no sense of direction left.

The more free the internet is the more ways people will have ways to abuse it. Which is a bit disturbing.\n\nThis is in my view a bit too dystopian - there are many more examples of this not being the case than this being the case. And the internet has never been entirely \"free\" of traditions - e.g. Lessig or Boyle as far back as the 1990s. \n\nThere was a discussion raised by Open Rights Group a few years ago about the relative political weakness of the \"web giants\" (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple).

Currently, I am extending expertise in data protection regulations (GDPR) ,[](http://) and international governance issues.\n\nThe position as a community manager brings different elements together that I am specifically interested in. I am keen to be involved in discussions on understanding people\u2019s perspective on the internet, use of new technologies and desired future and long-term strategies for the governance of the internet. During my time with WWF International and currently with VOLT (new European movement), I experienced the power of building online communities. I am eager to learn from various disciplines/expertise how the internet could be more human-centric and how a true global common could be created where the safety of citizens is guaranteed. My knowledge in the development of human rights/international law/norms could be a helpful outlook.  \n\nI am an enthusiastic team-player, adaptable, diplomatic and a critical observer. Integrity, open-mindedness, reliability and curiosity are my key values. Please let me you if you need any further information or have further questions. kind regards,\nNynke Khan Wijmenga", "created_at": "2019-03-21 12:23:37.990642", "updated_at": "2019-03-21 12:23:37.990642", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 320, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 60.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71515, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 198, "raw": "John, this sucks REALLY BADLY.

We identified several issues:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The benefit from sharing is, by definition, collective, and hard to appropriate for any individual. This makes it harder for struggling makers to summon the resources to invest in shared assets.</li>\n\n<li>Spaces for making are, at least in some countries, more expensive than spaces for non-fabbing activities. Health and safety regulations impose a number of constraints. Italian makers report that safety insurance regulation designed for corporates make makerspaces \"illegal by default\": you are not allowed to touch a drill unless you are an employee. British makers seem to have it easier, as some authorities take a \"don't ask, don't tell approach\".</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAs a result, there seem to be three ways to get financially viable spaces:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Piggyback on some existing institution that has some financial slack. This is the MIT model: in Europe, FabLab Torino leans on Arduino to continue in existence.</li>\n\n<li>Channel government and philantropic funding (more government in the case of Europe). Fablabs in Spain and the Netherlands were reported as being (sometimes indirectly, through semi-public foundations) by the state.</li>\n\n<li>Subscription fee + courses revenue for self-standing spaces. Success stories of this kind are rare. Three cases were mentioned: <a href=\"http://artisansasylum.com/\">Artisan's Asylum</a> in the Boston Area<span>\u00a0(the world's largest hackerspace); <a href=\"https://metalab.at/\">Metalab</a> in Vienna; and <a href=\"http://www.somakeit.org.uk/\">SoMakeIt</a> in Southampton</span><span>. The first one exploits economies of scale, but needs the demographics provided by a very large, affluent city. The latter were able to bootstrap themselves by \"packetizing\" the service: rent a garage two days a week initially, then scale up as paying members move in.\u00a0</span>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nAn interesting risk-reducing way to bootstrap is to allow membership fee payment in kind.

Consortium Coordinator responsabilities</h2>\n\nThese can be different between projects and are laid out in the Consortium Agreement (CA) of each project. The following is an example from the POPREBEL CA.\n\n* Monitor compliance by the Parties with their obligations.\n\n* Keep the address list of Members and other contact persons updated and available.\n\n* Collect, review (to verify consistency) and submit reports, other deliverables (including financial statements and related certifications) and specific requested documents to the Funding Authority.\n\n* Transmit documents and information connected with the Project to any other Parties concerned.\n \n* Administer the financial contribution of the Funding Authority and fulfilling the financial tasks described in Section 7.3.\n\n* Provide, upon request, the Parties with official copies or originals of documents that are in the sole possession of the Coordinator when such copies or originals are necessary for the Parties to present claims.\n\nIf one or more of the Parties is late in submission of any project deliverable, the Coordinator may nevertheless submit the other \u2019Parties\u2019 project deliverables and all other documents required by the Grant Agreement to the Funding Authority in time.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3.

Between Grant Agreement and project start</h2>\n\n_[TODO]_\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. During the project</h2>\n\n* **Financial reporting.** This is covered in its own topic: [Financial reporting for a Horizon 2020 project ](/t/id/9143)\n\n* **Non-financial reporting.** Also called \"continuous reporting\". This is covered in its own topic: [Non-financial reporting for a Horizon 2020 project](/t/id/9334)\n\n\n\n* **Rules for avoiding conflicts of interest.** According to the rules for purchasing goods, works or services (article 10 of the Grant Agreement):\n\n    > The beneficiaries must make such purchases ensuring the best value for money or, if appropriate, the lowest price. In doing so, they must avoid any conflict of interests.\n \n As a project coordinator, make sure that the team leaders and the team members respect the rules when buying services as explained under this topic: [Financial reporting for a Horizon 2020 project.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/reporting-for-a-horizon-2020-project/9143#heading--4-3) & in the [Procurement Policy.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/procurement-policy/12298)\n\n**Preparing and/or extending staff members' contracts.** Most of the staff contracts are made for one calendar year based on the available budget. At the end of the year, the project coordinator in collaboration with the team leaders prepares the contracts for the following year. This is done by making sure the allocated budget to all staff whose contracts are getting extended corresponds to the available budget for the specific task. \n\n- **Calculating parameters**. The parameters are introduced in this [monitoring spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cD8QM4XoaUMCJ22fyYRyQFNl6pv2-VY-2vUlSXehEKA/edit#gid=0) which provides the overview of the hired staff during projects as well as their reported time and amounts invoiced. The project coordinator makes the initial calculation based on the existing budget and our usual rates for all collaborators. \n    - The annual productive hours applied are calculated in accordance with the following method: **1720 annual productive hours (pro-rata for persons not working full-time)**. Find out more [HERE](https://edgeryders.eu/t/eu-research-arcana-understanding-pms/9489).\n    - How to calculate hourly personnel rates? In Horizon2020 projects we apply the **Option I**: the unit costs are calculated by dividing the total amount of personnel costs by the number of FTE and the annual total productive hours. Our PM cost is 6,000 eur. The hourly rate is therefore 41,86 eur.\n\nIf the contract is being renewed, the team leaders decide on the specific tasks of the collaborator in the following year and adjust the amount and time accordingly.\n\n- **Preparing and signing contracts.** \n1. The project coordinator prepares the contract template. The template for collaborators (considered as staff) can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fkMiOlVWc7kdxJr7JQKu9L1G9BsZ5nAUMMn2pOqoZMk/edit). The template for service providers can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TpUY0IIFb4qrRL9CiSLGYrz5wemniBkMKctpEG8hIhk/edit).\n2. The team leaders copy the template replacing the \"Contract template\" in the title with the name and surname of the collaborator / service provider. They fill-in the fields marked in yellow. Note that the difference from the contracts in 2019 is that the two projects (NGI Forward and POPREBEL) are described seperately, with the duties and the parameters to be introduced seperately as indicated. When writing the contracts under \"duties\" please pay attention that service providers CANNOT work on the implementation of the action described in the Annex 1 (Workpackage description). In the collaborators' contracts add ONLY duties related to the project in question.\n3.

So, the first (rightmost in Arabic) character of every line should be positioned at the very right of the paragraph area, right? I have fixed that now in <a href=\"#comment-9545\">your comment above</a>. Is it ok now? (I already feared that the relative positions of letters would've been messed up, so that a second letter would appear to the right of a first where it must be to the left of it in Arabic. But as far as I can tell, this is not a problem in your text, right?)\n\nOk, so if this solves the issue, here's how to apply that solution when posting Arabic text: before clicking \"Save\", select all the text (Ctrl + A) and click the \"Align right\" button in the editor toolbar. It's the one in the second row to the right, with the symbol showing four lines aligned at their right side. This did not work before, I had to fix it \u2013 thanks for pinpointing the mixed language issues on this site :)\n\nNote that, both for comments and wiki / node content, there is now a \"Language\" select box where you can choose \"Arabic\". This is relevant for translating on-site here, but does not fix the text alignment problem by itself. So you need to use the \"Align right\" button in addition. (Maybe I find a combined solution later, but it seems the Drupal software here is not up for that for now.)\n\n(P.S.: One more question for you: Is the Arabic text readable in size, compared to the Latin letter texts? Or do you have to magnify your browser view so much that the English text is too large when the Arabic is readable? If the latter, I'll have to find a solution to make Arabic language texts show up larger while keeping English language texts the same size.)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-02 15:44:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.069307", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 345, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24882], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64432, "user_id": 4640, "topic_id": 11504, "post_number": 11, "raw": "mtsn-\n\nOK. I was not familiar with Goodwin, but have taken some time to bone up. I looked at Wikipedia, which gives a very technical brief description that does not go into fundamentals, history or applications. This site (https://cruel.org/econthought/essays/multacc/goodw2.html) gives an overview, which is useful. they say: \" The basic features of [Goodwin's](https://cruel.org/econthought/profiles/goodwin.html) (1967) model can be stated simply: high employment generates wage inflation which can increase the wage share of workers in output; but this will, in turn, reduce the profits of capitalists and thus, in Kaleckian fashion, reduce future investment and output. That reduction in output will in turn reduce labor demand and employment and consequently lead to lower wage inflation or even deflation and thus reduce the wage share of workers. But as workers wage share declines, then profits increase and, with them, investment. This will lead to greater employment and thus improve the bargaining power of workers and consequently wages in Phillips Curve fashion and thus greater wage share in output - and the rest of the cycle then repeats itself. For good measure, Goodwin adds exogenous growth components - namely, labor supply growth and productivity growth.\"\n\nFirst off, this is technical for most participants. Second, and perhaps more to the point, the Phillips curve of low unemployment leading to high inflation has been moribund for years -- a model that depends on it is questionable. There are a number of reasons suggested which you undoubtedly know, but I'll recite a few: oligopoly creates monopsonistic labor markets, specialization ditto, globalization pushes wages down, as more powerfully does automation and AI.\n\nSo... if you want to improve the income of workers... it's not actually very easy. Economists know that the standard, and still politically favored remedies, such as complicated government-created labor market rules and high minimum wages and strong unions, mostly help the workers who are already the highest paid, and positively harm those who are low-paid by preventing companies from hiring them -- too expensive. The other method is to improve worker productivity, which is complicated, expensive and slow: comprehensive excellent education (of Singapore or Finland level) starting very early for everyone, focus on training which is relevant to current market needs (now much more need for creative workers with technical capacities who can work in teams, for example), high levels of training in the skills required to comprehensively and creatively operate the equipment used by workers (instead of minimal training), and high acceptability and mutual understanding of workers from different genders, ethnicities, cultures, etc, as a start. Obviously this includes education, in-company training and overall culture, and is a hugely ambitious (but desirable) goal.\n\nAnd as Alberto somewhat obliquely points out, to achieve the goal, it needs not just to include tech workers in rich countries, but much more importantly the teeming billions in poor countries. I am the kind of economist who is likely to remind everyone that capitalism in its rawest form lifted about half a billion Chinese from poverty to middle-income life in the second half of the 20th century, along with a quarter-billion Indians and another quarter-billion from various places such as South Africa, Chile, Mexico, Indonesia, etc. On the other side, I was a fan of Prebisch's Dependency Theory in the 80s: if the \"center vs. periphery\" model is valid, there may not be a long-term upside for periphery countries, and the benefits of technology may not have much more for them than lifting the top 10 or 15% and leaving the rest in the gutter. That has of course been the theme of many dystopian novels. And obviously if the entire globe is a single economy, then the center vs. periphery applies to people within a country as well as between countries -- in the US, of course, the effects can be seen if anyone wants to look. At this stage I'm inclined to think we need robust support systems for outlier individuals & families -- probably something like conditional cash transfer programs -- to prevent that very thing from happening -- some of my students at Houston Community College are in that cycle, and it's bloody hard to break out of. That would be controversial in the US, but we aren't looking at political feasibility at this stage.\n\nTo relate this to sci-fi... the early utopian & other stuff on which most of my reading has been done doesn't come up to the need, tell the truth. Anybody know of a literary work that includes such a model? Most of the recent stuff is much more likely to reflect the consequences of doing things wrong, as we certainly are doing...", "created_at": "2019-11-17 22:49:17.911751", "updated_at": "2019-11-17 22:49:17.911751", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 791, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 33.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [64070], "is_liked_by": [5698], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9430, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 502, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Pings to make sure you don't miss the GNU Health project!</b>\n\nNice to meet you @Meanmicio, I'm nowhere near as knowledgeable about health systems as you, but some people here in the community are and should definitely read this (they may \u00a0have already heard about GNU Health): @Ivan_Ezeigbo @wachsmuth @markomanka who can maybe help share this with networks.\n\nAre you finding that people and\u00a0established institutions\u00a0are transitioning to this easily (ideologically speaking)\u00a0or what do you see is an average learning curve?

It takes place on October 8th from 14.30 to 16.00, on Zoom. It is fully booked, with 150 registrations :slight_smile: . The participants are very diverse: public servants at all levels, from the city to the Commission, European networks, consultants, academics and so on. In this thread, we work out what will actually happen. \n\n## The agenda\n\n14.30-14.40 Intro & housekeeping\n14.40 - 15:15 invited speakers\n15:15 - 15.30 individual work & coffee\n15.30 - 16.00 open discussion chat.\n\n## Sneak peek on the content\n\n**Introduction** by me (@alberto), 5 minutes. I am going to claim that citizen engagement is an obviously good idea which has mostly underdelivered in our experience. Part of this disappointing performance, however, has to do with the tendency of decision makers to restrict it to a very narrow Overton window: \"how you want X done?\" rather than \"do we need X at all?\". Regional policies in particular are characterized by the idea of \"convergence\": everybody should imitate the \"model\" regions. This sets peripheral regions up to fail, and it is not at all clear that the inhabitants of, say, Thessaly have a particular desire to reproduce the economy of Bavaria. \n\nRegional policies are a spectacular opportunity that Europe, *and only Europe*, has to experiment with different economic models. Doing so would help accelerate the transition towards a circular, low-carbon, just, green economy that we need to achieve anyway; we can try many ideas at a time, discard those which don't work and scale those that do. I suspect that involving citizens in shaping policies for regions to follow their own approach to the transition would result in very high-quality participation, and consensus for bold policies would make them more effective.\n\n**Prepared interventions** by our four official speakers. 7 minutes each, with no slides (if people feel they need slides that's cool too).\n\n1. **Alessandro Bellantoni** (Head of the Open Government Unit, OECD) sets the stage. The OECD has an extensive programme of work citizen participation. There seems to be a paradox: citizen demand participation channels, while at the same time decision makers complain of how difficult it is to get them involved. Why?\n2. @amelia **Hassoun** (Anthropologist, Oxford Internet Institute) discusses her work on smart cities. Smart cities are an example of policy with a strong technocratic flavour. As an ethnographer, Amelia's job is to render how these policies look like from the point of view of the impacted citizens. What is her take on engagement? Is it low? Or is it not being captured by the \"official\" debate?\n\n3. @giacomo.pinaffo (Project manager, Fondazione di Comunit\u00e0 Messina) presents the experience of Messina. Sicily is supposed to be a \"difficult\" region, with low trust in the institutions. How did his Foundation achieve high level of trust and participation of citizens? Several dimensions are interesting here, for example stability of policies and the emphasis of increasing the range of choices that people can make (\u00e0 la Sen). \n\n4. **Stefan Appel** (Head of Unit of the Competence Centre for administrative capacity building and the EU solidarity fund, DG REGIO) brings a policy makers' point of view. What does the issue of citizen engagement look like to DG REGIO? Why does the Commission think it is so important? Is the issue similar across the 244 NUTS-2 regions, or are there differences, and what can we say about them? What needs to be done? \n\n\n**Individual work and coffee**. We have too many participants for breakout rooms. instead, we give people the link https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14498 and ask individuals (not groups) to post their takes on the citizen engagement-regional policies nexus: experiences, questions to panelists, statements. \n\n**Open discussion**. Moderated by me on the audio/video channel, by @MariaEuler on the chat. We invite questions and the sharing of experiences, also using those that come through the tell.edgeryders.eu channel. I pick some up, and invite panelists to react. Of course, panelists can also ask questions, as well as step forward to react to questions they are interested in. \n\nAny thoughts? \n\n![image](/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f36fbc6c27d7d16bf8aa93678275f0cd957ceada.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-09-29 15:35:08.968809", "updated_at": "2020-10-08 11:52:43.789008", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 730, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 603.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 6417, 3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62568, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11316, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I have already reported on the [workshop on online identities](/t/10868) led by @RobvanKranenburg at the NGI Forum in Helsinki. As I read more about the topic, I find many words and expressions that are highly specific of that intellectual space, and they are not  necessarily super intuitive for a nonspecialist who is trying to form an opinion. So, I feel the need for a small glossary where I can stash their definitions, and come back to when I need to refresh one. Lately I came across [this post](https://www.theinternetofthings.eu/roadmap-identity-creation-people-and-objects), and I decided to start writing one. I'm making it a wiki in case others want to help.\n\n### Disposable identities\n\n> Disposable identities are temporary attribute-based identities describing a smart contract between a receiver and a supplier of a service, ie. rent, leasing a car, energy for a home, paying taxes, basically any service.\n\nI am not sure about the \"smart contract\" part, but the \"disposable\" part seems to point to identities that are \"one shot\": you use them to secure a certain service, and then never again. In An example close to the experience of many of us is disposable email addresses: these are addresses you only use when you sign up to an online service, and only to do one thing: validate the email address. Once validated, you throw them away, or [they even self-destruct](https://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html)  (but now need to store your login information in a safe place). You can also get disposable phone numbers, and there is even a fun [Fake name generator](http://www.fakenamegenerator.com/) you can use to confuse algorithms. \n\nOk, but then how would it work to rent a car based on a disposable identity? When you rent a car, you need to show your driving license, for the very good reason that you carry responsibility and liabilities for any bad deed you might be carrying out with that car. It would be nice to rent one with a disposable ID, but I don't think Avis is going to be willing to give you the keys. \n\n### Trust framework\n\nI think the document refers to the [IoT Trust Framework](https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2018/iot-trust-framework-v2-5/). This is basically a checklist meant to assess the trustability of a connected device. If the device does not meet the framework's requirements (that is, if one or more \"must have\" characteristics are not there), then the device is not trustable.\n\n### Provable computing\n\nI cannot find online definitions of this. By analogy with [provable security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provable_security), I imagine it to be a type of computing which does *not* happen in a black box; you can verify that the computing really treats the input data in the way it says on the label. +\n\nIn science, we have a similar concept called [reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility). It comes down to publishing not just your results, but also your data and the code to crunch them.\n\n### Self-sovereign identities\n\n> Self-sovereign identity is the concept that people and businesses can store their own identity data on their own devices, and provide it efficiently to those who need to validate it, without relying on a central repository of identity data. [...]  There are three parts to identity: **claims** , **proofs** , and **attestations**.

healthcare on the Zad**\n\nShared experience and common desire brought into existence several dynamics around healthcare based in the Zad of Notre-Dame-des-Landes. Here we present four of them : the organisation of street medics, the medic team of the zad, the herbalism project and the group who organises street medic trainings.\n\nThese dynamics share several common bases. There is a desire to reappropriate knowledge around healthcare, because we find it important to decentralize knowledge related to our bodies, but also as a response to the difficulties in relationship to classical institutions of healthcare : the ambulances blocked by law enforcement, the routine collaboration of hospitals with police, and the disdain and non-respect of consent lived by some. There is the desire to learn and share knowledge about more holistic ways of healing and which is not dependent on the pharmaceutical industry. There is the desire to reinforce social movements by propagating knowledge about emergency care and to form new groups. \n\nThese projects are independent but they are all entangled with elements of herbalism introduced into our street medic practices, trainings which bring new participants into the medic teams, and our experiences on the ground which nourish the content of the trainings. \n\n**The street medics**\n\nAs soon as we show disagreement in concrete ways,  or we block the smooth unfolding of increasing profit, repression quickly follows.  Whether for the duration of a demonstration or because we live together on an outlawed zone , or when we are labeled \u00ab undesirable \u00bb or \u00ab protestors \u00bb, the State wounds and kills at the hands of law enforcement. \n\nConsious of these risks, in many countries revolutionary groups and activist movements have developed their own medical support networks for demonstrations or direct actions. This dynamic is different than humanitarian practices like the Red Cross, because we don\u2019t pretend to be neutral. We take a clear political stance and an active role in the conflict, and in the support that we bring to our comrades in struggle.\n\nIn a demonstration, street medic teams try to be present on the scene as early as possible to be able to provide emergency care to people who ask for it , and to evaluate the needs of the situation before an ambulance arrives, which is sometimes blocked or diverted by the police. There is also an assessment of the legal risks in the case of recourse to official emergency care : for example, identity controls and arrests inside the hospitals to take in people without papers, people with outstanding warrants, or just because the simple fact of being wounded makes someone a suspect. \n\nLaw enforcement regularly update their equipment dedicated to repression with new chemical, electrical and physical weapons. As street medics, we try to respond by spreading techniques of defense developed on the ground and shared across the world for preventing, protecting, and healing. \n\nFor us, medical knowledge is accompanied by a political reflection in how we put it into practice, to avoid reproducing as much as possible relationships of domination, administration, and dispossession that the medical institution exerts. Our desire as street medics is to put the first priority on the consent of injured people and to give them the information to make clear and informed choices for themselves. \t\n\n**The street medic team of the Zad**\n\nOn the zad there is a medic team which represents an autonomous medical presence during demonstrations and actions, including during past and possible future evictions, but also being present on the ground for medical emergencies when they happen. The medic team brings together people who are interested in that role, with or without official training (there are very few people with professional backgrounds). We organize together to get the knowledge and the material necessary to be able to be autonomous in actions or demonstrations. \n\nDaily healthcare plays an important part in our work. There is a house with a living collective where many medics live, and people can pass through with their injuries or health problems for material, care, advice, and contacts. We evaluate the person and depending on their desires and the capacity of the individual who is treating them (knowledge in first aid, conventional medicine, or herbalism), either we treat them or we direct them to further care.  For this we have contacts with medical professionals we trust (nurses, doctors, osteopaths, homeopaths\u2026) who are in exchange and relationship with us. \n\nThere is also a medic trailer, to make sure that we are not the only way tfor people to have access to medical materials. It is left open, and stocked with first aid materials to use there, and material and information for harm reduction linked to drug use and sexual practices. \n\nWe also are part of a network of healthcare workers involved in the struggle against the airport. During the evictions of autumn 2012, a number of healthcare professionals came to support the medics on the ground. Over the years, we have worked together to prepare logistical and communications strategies, and to have the materials necessary in the case of eviction attempts or other police intervention. We also have regular discussions, and regular reciprocal trainings. \n\n**The herbalism projects**\n\nFor the past six years, a dynamic around medicinal plants has been developing and made concrete by the creation of a medicinal garden, a dispensary, the creation of an autonomous phytotherapy school, the organisation of plant walks, and of trainings on the uses of plants and how to prepare them. There is a clinic project in the early stages, with regular individual consultations for chronic conditions, and drop in clinic days for more acute illness. \n\nAs many other projects which co-inhabit this zone, care by plants is rooted for us in a logic of long term struggle and autonomy, in conflict with the State and capitalist logics. As we try different ways to live, to resolve conflicts without legal intervention, to organize with many people with a diversity of positions and practices in the same territory, we take the liberty to be autonomous in care. We don\u2019t want the world of the pharmaceutical industry, and of the disempowerment of bodies by a vertical and imposed system. We want to play an active r\u00f4le in the expansion of a method of accessible, understandable, and participative care which opens up new paths towards more knowledge of our bodies and the plants that surround us. \n\nWith a local support group we have built a cabin which serves as a lab for making and storing medicine, a place for distribution, for care, and passing on knowledge. From this place we offer different forms of consultations- individual, but also other times where we see people in a more collabotative exchange, to be able to share skills and learn together with the person seeking care, while having access to the dispensary so that we move together beyond a theoretical level. \n\n**Street medic trainings**\n\nThe training group was created after realizing that the militant french networks were relatively poorly organized in terms of street medics, in comparison with other European countries or in North America. The street medic trainings are intended as a tool for improving our capacity to self-defence by contributing to the existence and multiplication of street medic teams in france and neighboring countries.\n\nThe trainings are done for specific geographic areas, to encourage the creation of local groups who can continue to practice and organize together.\n\nThe group was formed around self-training in relationship to first aid ; it consists of mainly non healthcare professionals involved in social struggles, with diverse levels of skill and experience. \n\nThe complete nine day trainings focus mainly on the most likely injuries in the case of demonstations or riots, the possible complications or aggravations of illness in these moments (stress, fatigue, cold, etc.) as well as psychoemotional injury. We have added a part about the weapons used by law enforcement and about advice for medics in action situations (organization, prevention\u2026), as well as moments dedicated to harm reduction in sexual practices and in drug use.

Here, the [notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/a7c814b919b321fb). I have not found time to review it, but imo the main points are:\n\n* Some people say that economical growth must be slowed down to save the Planet. [Others](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/09/climate-crisis-economic-growth-green-economy) strongly disagree. We do not want to shed light on this debate because we are not experts (me at least).\n* We are interested in imaging what a zero growth capitalistic society looks like. We assume that, in a near future, governments are forced to implement zero growth policies because scientists and economists have discovered that economical growth is intrinsically unsustainable and a sudden worsening of the climate crisis is demanding severe countermeasures (otherwise human race could face extinction). We do not know if the unsustainability hypothesis is true in the real world, we assume that it is true (or believed to be true) in our fictional world. This setting reminds me of some Asimov's novels.\n* We use the Goodwin model, which is \"starkly schematised and hence quite unrealistic model of cycles in growth rates\" (from [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-05504-3_12)). However, it is interesting because it describes the economical machinery. Probably, it is not a formal description of mainstream economics, because it seems to be written by the specter of Karl Marx. \n* We do not use the model for accurate predictions, but to generate stories. I am thinking of [The Castle of Crossed Destinies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_Crossed_Destinies) by Italo Calvino. Basically, he imagines to create interleaving stories from \"random\" combinations of playing cards. Less poetically, we use model parameters instead of cards.\n\nWhat does the model say imo?\n\n* Zero growth is bad. Unemployment is one of its consequences. Nothing new here, I suppose.\n* In order to keep zero growth, Governments need to use their iron fist. First, they need to fight discontent (from unemployment), then they have to control the job market size and technology.\n* Capitalists do not like zero growth, as well. In normal conditions, the model seems to suggest that the ROI for companies goes down in time (probably, Goodwin here encoded the Marx's [falling rate of profit argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendency_of_the_rate_of_profit_to_fall) in his equations). But ROI peaks are smaller near zero growth. This means, if I am not wrong with my calculations,  that business owners can hope in big future profits in both positive and negative markets, but, near (not exactly at) zero growth, they have to give up their hopes (better a crisis than zero growth). In this context they need to find profits elsewhere, e.g. commodification of everyday life, worsening working conditions and quality of products/services, the usual stuff. At the same time, they could lobby the government in order to relax the zero growth policies.\n\nThe scenario is basically the classical cyberpunk story with different possible flavors, depending if government is stronger than big companies or vice versa.\n\nNext step is the validation of existing sci-fi novels using extensions of the model.

Here are some definitions of \u201cpolitical system\u201d. Political system is a conglomerate of organizations, interested groups (political parties, industrial associations), the relationship between these institutions, both the political norms and laws, and laws regulating their functions (constitution, election law).\n\nPolitical system consists of NGOs with authority. Political studies - one of the organic part of humanities culture. It includes the experience of many generations, who are engaged in the research of political and other problems of a government. The experience belongs not only to the government, but also to contemporary times, continuing to influence on political process, ideological movements and on political theoretical knowledge of evolution.

It's one to do with purpose, the WHY you want this stuff.\u00a0 It is not clear that there is indeed an interest or need to access data in and of itself. I think part of what makes data accessible is the context and a frame of enquiry that drives interest from a large number of people to access, investigate and make data more accessible to thers. Have you seen the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">Guardian's Data blog</a>?\n\nI tend to ask myself a few questions in developing the context: is it here? Is it now? Does it affect me? Is there anything I can do about it? If I can't answer the above I have to keep digging until I have made it convincingly say yes to all the above questions.\n\nMaybe start by describing some situations that you have come across in attempting to affect change there has been or is a need. Or cases where the availability of data or people's ability to understand it has had clear effect on the outcome.

In January this year, an extreme heatwave in Australia caused wildlife deaths, bushfires, and a rise in hospital admissions while at the same time a polar vortex rolled over the US, disrupting life across an entire region with decades-old records falling. With the air and water temperatures around the tropical Atlantic rising quickly, hurricanes like Dorian which hit the Bahamas last summer, will develop and grow stronger more quickly and carry more rain as they move.\n\nWe don&rsquo;t have the luxury to sit around any longer and hope it&rsquo;ll be ok: climate change is here.\n\nAround 10% of the world&rsquo;s total [electricity is consumed by the internet](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-can-the-internet-help-the-climate/9856/12), and training a deep learning algorithm produces the equivalent of 626,000 pounds of carbon dioxide \u2014[ nearly five times as much as the lifetime emissions of the average American car](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613630/training-a-single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/), including the manufacturing process.\n\nAnd then there&rsquo;s a strong trend to push electricity consumption onto the internet where energy costs are less transparent. Cutting travelling and moving to internet-based conference calls isn&rsquo;t as environmentally friendly as some might think ([the internet currently consumes as much energy as the airline industry](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-do-troll-factories-have-to-do-with-the-5g-scare/10059/7)).\n\nWhat this means is that we have different components which affect our climate, and technology is one of them.\n\n## What we do in the next 50 years will have an impact on the next 10,000 years.\n\nTo move away from the path that we are on and towards a stable and resilient planet, we need to reduce our carbon emissions significantly and find a way to live more sustainable lives.\n\nCutting carbon emissions needs businesses, governments, and people to make significant investments and coordinated efforts. In other words, to be successful we must all tackle technology, policy, and behavioral change together at the same time in such a way that progress in one reinforces/is aligned with progress in the other two.\n\n## From consumption to play to the internet\n\nThe world needs to cut half of the carbon emissions by 2030. Although [banning plastic straws ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/deep-green-internet-of-biases-and-other-terrible-ways-to-open-a-conversation/10190/10)has been shown to have little impact on its own, there are several interlinked solutions to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n&ldquo;Examples include withdrawing from coastlines, shutting down vulnerable industrial facilities, or giving up expectations for certain types of consumption,&rdquo; [writes British sustainability professor Jem Bendell](https://edgeryders.eu/t/please-read-the-deep-adaptation-paper/10726).\n\nBut not only our immediate actions matter, as Bendell writes. It is also about changing our value systems, cultural identities, and routines that have shifted during our carbon-emission-dependent capitalist society, such as by &ldquo;re-wilding landscapes, so they provide more ecological benefits and require less management, changing diets back to match the seasons, rediscovering non-electronically powered forms of play, and increased community-level productivity and support.&rdquo;\n\nBut what about the tech side of it in terms of green products? Right now, the internet is a net contributor to climate change: can the development of the net even be considered outside of this reality? In other words, what technological development should we as a society want to invest in and how? How can we create a human-centered internet which doesn&rsquo;t make the situation worse?\n\n## How do we know if something has had an impact?\n\nKnowing if what we do has an impact is extremely difficult, [as explained ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/on-assessing-impact-and-what-edgeryders-could-do-in-that-department/10708)in this Edgeryders discussion. Many governments are eager to measure with scalar indicators which they control, such as GDP and ROI. This form of &ldquo;administrative ordering&rdquo; could lead to a not desirable changing reality, as seen with Stalin&rsquo;s collectivization of agriculture.\n\n&ldquo;Stalin&rsquo;s collectivisation programme was terrible at growing crops. But it worked very well in appropriating crops to feed industrial cities, the base of Soviet power, and in keeping the peasantry in check. In other words, these schemes are successful parasites. Once they take hold, they are hard to kill,&rdquo; as Edgeryders founder Alberto Cottica [writes here](http://www.cottica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/black_briefing_sgs.pdf).\n\nSo, what can be done so governments really appreciate what is going on in complex systems such as the economy or the global environment?\n\nTwo researchers, George Cowan and Brian Arthur at the Santa Fe Institute, believe that governments should mostly observe, monitor, and experiment as a wise government recognises that it is part of the environment it seeks to influence.\n\n## What Edgeryders does and how you can be part of it\n\nAt Edgeryders, we bring different solutions for societal problems together through people, [social science methods, and open source technologies](https://edgeryders.eu/t/about-the-software-ssna-category/147). We work with governments to implement these solutions, and we&rsquo;re in the middle of creating new places to live and work together where everyone can develop the skills, behaviors, and social norms needed for thriving in a decarbonised future.\n\nBy innovating new social science through research collaborations with leading universities, testing new methods for organising people and knowledge, and creating new technologies to transform large scale conversations into collective wisdom, we&rsquo;re working on all three layers needed to make a substantial change.\n\nAnd this is where you come in:\n\n* How would you/not approach developing a deep green trustmark for digital tech?\n* What would you try/avoid doing?\n* Who \u2014 or what \u2014 would you bring into that conversation?\n* And how would you mobilize people in tech to contribute or adopt using it?\n\nYou can join this conversation [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/deep-green-internet-of-biases-and-other-terrible-ways-to-open-a-conversation/10190). And to discuss how a human-centered internet could contribute to a more sustainable world, instead of eating up insane amounts of electricity, [join this discussion](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-can-the-internet-help-the-climate/9856/2) to come up with a solution how &ldquo;tech doesn&rsquo;t need to make it worse.&rdquo;\n\nYou might also consider attending[ the international Edgeryders Festival](https://festival.edgeryders.eu/) taking place all over Europe between November 19th and 29th, where we will discuss how the startup structure and the technology it produces could be deep green, ecologically sustainable, and regenerative.

The event will consist of four parts: a double keynote lecture \u2013 which will also be live-streamed; Reclaiming Utopia, a workshop where you can learn how to mobilize yourself for a more humane, fairer, greener economy, in collaboration with Extinction Rebellion; a party, because &ldquo;if we can&rsquo;t dance, we don&rsquo;t want your alt-economy;&rdquo; and a brainstorming session to create abstracts for contributions to economic theory and economic policy underpinning fictional economies.\n\n&ldquo;Basically, what we are trying to do from a societal point of view, is to build a range of alternatives that society could choose from. Maybe we want to keep the present system, but we shouldn&rsquo;t keep the economic system because we can&rsquo;t think of a better one,&rdquo; says Alberto\n\n## The event is taking place in Brussels, as it&rsquo;s the capital of Europe where &ldquo;we can multiply the impact of a shift in thinking&rdquo;\n\nThe keynote lecture is going to be chaired by Kirsten Dunlop, CEO of EIT Climate-KIC \u2014 the European Union&rsquo;s largest agency, funding climate innovation. &ldquo;We want to generate a fresh kind of thinking, which we can share with the public, the public authorities, the public powers.&rdquo; Alberto adds. &ldquo;If we can show to economists and to science fiction authors the interest of the public powers, then we can incentivize them to do more work in this area.&rdquo;\n\n## But we cannot do it without your support!\n\nHelp us with our crowdfunding campaign, choose your pledge and receive the ticket plus goodies for the Brussels 11th event:\n\n![|32x32](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ye6Aff4H4p6eI3yjl5KPpD5hP8V1-xHIeFHx1C34utSUSCjAJ3d5fiS_cac7UbI2ZaAXt0TqlcOPFfhqAlV8baH-_iYovBvpqRDxUJLr6SmybZUHW0nhhlgYJ2ADxkHX4daroghj) [Indiegogo 2](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sci-fi-economics-lab-live-streaming-event)\n\n![|128x68](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZILZc1RFke5QKH-dzhqCcBlv0bGh6pO5kTAaw0UUTJ4_4Tp41ySxCTbOkemdv78viM1ztSlrG5nQqr0IiI6X9cbLRzAnoA9W8UTK4rUc-4Fg7v9-4ms9R6UGknh3FbxP_JHBLKFd)\n\n### [Sci-Fi Economics Lab - Live streaming &amp; event](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sci-fi-economics-lab-live-streaming-event)\n\nTop-notch science fiction authors and economists get economic thinking out of its current box | Check out 'Sci-Fi Economics Lab - Live streaming &amp; event' on Indiegogo.\n\n## You cannot make it to Brussels?\n\nYou can still support the project, and gain access to the live streaming of the event!\n\nWe also commit to document the brainstorming session to write Sci-FI Economics papers, and share the documentation with you.\n\nAnd finally, we are Edgeryders: working together remotely is what we do.

I can partly relate to that.\n\nCan I somehow encourage you to still do your workshop? I had not signed in so far, because it would mean commiting to one activity during the entire day, even though I'm very interested. I was still pondering on giving a workshop on \"Apprechiative Inquiry\" on sunday and was indecisive, because your walk sounded so nice (It lost a bit of its attractiveness, when it was sized-down to a less free walking tour, which I found to be a pity).\n\nBut I wasn't stressing with pressing the \"I attend\" button, because I thought LOTE5 (and especially sunday) was unconference style! As in\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Whoever comes are the right people</li>\n\n<li>Whenever it starts is the right time</li>\n\n<li><i>Wherever it is, is the right place (walking tour, yeah!)</i></li>\n\n<li>Whatever happens is the only thing that could have</li>\n\n<li>When it's over, it's over (within this session)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nYou said that the idea is that the community decides on the workshops to happen. And if I understood it correctly, one person said it had to be cancelled. If I (as a member of the community) say now \"it IS going to happen\" - what now? :) Are we even and it's up for discussion again? I'm sure I can find a couple of more voters ... Maybe I'm missing the point, but this is an attempt to encourage you. And maybe that makes no sense, because the decision is made.\n\nCheers and I hope this sorts itself out in best way possible, so you can still attend LOTE5 and look forward to it, even.\n\nKaja\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-09 08:15:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.883636", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 316, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3067, 2201, 3, 2694], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62426, "user_id": 5252, "topic_id": 11249, "post_number": 3, "raw": "For the building itself the main idea was to create a foundation functioning as a trust.\n\nThe trust has been described as \"a more flexible option in which a community buy a place, but the individuals rents it.

We should invite the team of PlanB Festival - Leontien and Euard - to co-create this concept with us cause they have already a lot of experience in this kind of participatory art production in the private living spaces of people they don\u2019t know. They can also tell how difficult it is. They are also on the way to develop methodology for this kind of practice and I think we could offer them to try them out in the different contexts outside of Belgium in the framework of this project.\n\nWhen I\u2019m thinking about this idea and when i\u2019m reading the principles of the open call, i\u2019m quite sure that we should include the topic of migration into it. I know some people from migration office in Berlin and maybe we can get them on the board. The way of exhibiting you are writing about reflects obviously migration processes. And this kind of participatory art creation itself is based on movement and displacement. We will be placing \u201calien bodies\u201d in the most private spaces of humans, their living spaces. We could consider in this step to think about what kind of artists we want to invite and what could be the topic of art works they will be creating with their hosts. I can imagine the idea of migration and integration as a subject that could be very interesting for both sides. In such scenario it could be great to invite artists with migration backgrounds - who have anyway difficulties in finding work space and collaborators in a new environment. It would make the whole project sustainable for more people. \nAt the end of every \u201cresidency\u201d we could organize an event to celebrate - like a family celebration in the local environment organized together with hosts and artists.\n\nAll \u201cresidencies\u201d in different cities should be brought together in the form of documentation and interaction online, like this one here :slightly_smiling_face: \n\nAnd the end we should organize an exposition with all works and testimonials.\n\nThis is my first reaction.

I have some ideas, looking forward to yours.  \n* **Mixing the crowds**. SF-lovers, utopians and restless folks might be immediately attracted to this idea. Should we make a conscious effort to mix in people from academia, too? Who? How?\n* **Being locals**. This is just my preference, and I am open to changing my mind.

How do you make a credible value proposition to the people you are trying to engage?

It is not an online management class, though I do have that also and can present it if and when needed.  In the spirit of the summary above, and thinking about the \"hands-on, co-design\" aspect that is the core of it, I have so far largely framed my approach posing a number of questions that the co-designers will need to consider.  \n\nDo we want to come away with some sort of structure, or agreed-upon basis for how it will be self-governed and how it will actually be managed? I'm not looking to make a rule book and I don't think that would work anyway.  If we set a few parameters I think we will improve the odds of a smoother experience.  \n\nOn the other hand, we can just set up the space, trust everyone there will figure it out, tell everyone to work hard, share and don't be an asshole and let it happen more spontaneously.  There is a continuum in a sense where you had a pretty tight monastery-like arrangement like the Farm all the way to the open land experiments of Morningstar Ranch and Drop City.  We fall in between there, but I am still getting a bearing on where we fall along that line.  And where we of ER, Inc. are, and where a MENA Reef will be.

We use a piece of paper and a smartphone that recognizes the paper and puts on it a 3d object .\nWe will be using this technology to project a small 3d animation with voice that reads the story . the paper we will be using will be the reading books used in school education in tunisia .\nWith animation on the words something like karaoke , the kids will be able to read the stories , learn and have fun.In addition to this , the app will have special animation in words and the stories to suit the needs of special kids , like the dyslexique ones .\nThat was the reading feature , also the app will have a game zone that will help children play to learn basic things like numbers and letters but this time using another technology that helps bring 3d objects in the real word without using the paper , something like pokemon go and lots of other features to help improve the imagination of the children \n \n \nNow we are a team of four engineers:\n\nMyself, I am a book lover , a game player .

In a good week this means clocking 5-600 views of profile pages \u2013 but remember, things might get much busier as we get closer to \\#LOTE3. There are three problems with this:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>profile pages are very ugly to look out. We stuck them together in the early days of the new Drupal 7 platform, got something that more or less worked and moved on.</li>\n\n<li>They are uninformative. Specifically, they don't tell the viewer where people are from, which is a useful piece of information in general.</li>\n\n<li>They are very complicated and costly for users to fill all the information in. Practically no one uses all of the fields.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo, the user profile pages need to be redesigned. Specifically:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>start by evaluating the information that people are willing to share and interested in.</li>\n\n<li>figure out a way to factor the \"where\" information. We probably want to ask where people are based: shall we ask for the country or the city? Is there a way to automatically aggregate the info, so that if the user inputs \"Rome\" or \"Roma\" in the field the website knows that both strings refer to an Italian city with coordinates <span>41.9000\u00b0 N, 12.5000\u00b0 E? This would allow us to generate maps at various levels of details \u2013 not terribly important now, but might come in handy in the future. </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>assess the legacy: what is in the already existing 1,500 + user profiles? What of that information should be featured prominently, what can be put in a digital cellar and not looked at unless some specific need arises? (Examples: do we really need Facebook/Twitter accounts of people? Can't we just use search engines if we want to add people on FB? How many people are really using the \"Projects\" field? etc.)</li>\n\n<li>design an ergonomic and elegant front end</li>\n\n<li>design a simplified back end, i.e the page that the user sees when she inputs her data. Make an estimate of how much work it takes to fill a profile.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThis task requires no coding or installation of modules, but it does require working on the Drupal admin interface and an administrator-level account.

The focus is developing helpers, and looking at the social aspects of care, so Im going to be focused on this for a while :)\n\nThis article popped up in my feeds (don't ask) today and it reminded me of <a href=\"/t/life-and-death-at-the-unmonastery/1940\">this post</a> I wrote about rituals around death and mourning (or lack thereof) in contemporary culture:\n\n\"Ideally, this exercise in death could also emphasize the fact that each of us is here for a reason. And that each of us has a unique set of gifts, talents, experience and wisdom to share. If we are not utilizing these in some way - both to bring us joy and to help others in some way - then both we as a collective, as well as some individuals (whom we may never know) - suffer from this loss - whether we realize this or not. If we are not actively shining our light - the world becomes a darker place.\" - Linda K.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3284587/Learn-dead-day-Suicidal-people-locked-coffins-bizarre-death-experience-schools-South-Korea-40-people-kill-day.html\">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3284587/Learn-dead-day-Suicidal-people-locked-coffins-bizarre-death-experience-schools-South-Korea-40-people-kill-day.html</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-25 17:53:00", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 11:46:10.748854", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 339, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 295.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62923, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 11355, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The Deep Dive is an event that accelerates learning between professionals from very different fields.

In some cultures, the dead are permanently embedded into the daily lives of the living, such as when Taoists pray to their ancestors via altars, or when the Japanese pay respects to their dead in mediated ways through digital budisan on apps and websites.

Notwithstanding what I said in reply to @Alberto below about the need to retain a degree of 'expert-pateint' hierarchy, I am very interested in exploring the prospects for more collaborative healing.\n\nIndeed, the nature of Traditional East Asian Medicine is very collaborative already - patients can be given exercises to do, dietary changes, self-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxibustion\">moxa</a> kits, or herbal teas that all supplement and reinforce the acupuncture treatment, meaning that they are far more involved in their own journey back to wellness.\n\nOne idea I had was to supplement the clinic with a once-a-week 'Moxa Club' where people could come and learn to safely use moxa on each other. Many more people could be treated simultaneously than is possible with just one acupuncturist; if partners, friends or family came together, they could then continue treatments at home; and the overall message - that people should be learning the skills to keep themselves healthy - would be inherent in the model.\n\nThe BAcC is actually moving funding towards Proof-of-Concept studies for 2017; there might be some scope for creating a project that combined different aspects of Opencare in this sort of way.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-03 18:58:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:07.736387", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 233, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8937], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56643, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 75, "raw": "@Matthias is explaining it exactly the way I thought of it from the beginning - here we are on the same page.

Edukativni programi su, generalno, u opisu mog posla, a moje srce kuca u Dramskoj radionici za decu, koju samostalno vodim, te pi\u0161em i adaptiram tekstove za istu, ve\u0107im delom vezano za lokalne pri\u010de, situacije i likove. Sentimentalno sam vezana za dr\u017eavu u kojoj \u017eivim i za selo u kojem sam odrasla. Razloge ne\u0107u obja\u0161njavati, jer su oni, su\u0161tinski, iracionalni. :slight_smile: \n\nNakon ovog uvodnog, po malo CV-jevskog dela mog predstavljanja, nastavi\u0107u sa jednim priznanjem: ve\u0107 nedeljama poku\u0161avam da napi\u0161em ''moju pri\u010du'', koja bi bila dovoljno li\u010dna i jedinstvena, kakve su, na kraju krajeva, sve va\u0161e pri\u010de. Iz po\u0161tovanja prema @jasen_lakic i njegovom zalaganju da prenese Edgeryders iskustvo i u ovaj deo Srbije, mo\u017eda sam se \u010dak i forsirala da to uradim \u0161to pre i \u0161to bolje.  Ovo nije urodilo plodom. :smiley: \n\nOtuda sam re\u0161ila da sa vama podelim jednu pri\u010du koju, prvobitno, nisam napisala za potrebe ovog foruma, ve\u0107 za jedno detinjstvo i za neke ljude ikoji su sada negde daleko, ra\u0161trkani po svetu.  Onima koji odvoje vreme da pro\u010ditaju redove koji slede - srda\u010dno se zahvaljujem. \n\nMo\u017eda \u0107ete se i sami setiti ne\u010deg sli\u010dnog, iz sopstvenog \u017eivotnog mozaika. :slight_smile: \n\n![image|690x517](upload://cLtstoKrzZMn4VTMuVLhuxCpUB4.jpeg) \n\nCrkva Svetog preobra\u017eenja Gospodnjeg u Ba\u010dkom Gradi\u0161tu, od kako znam za sebe, bila je okru\u017eena gustim jorgovanom koji je, gotovo uvek, bio uredno potkresan kao ''\u017eiva ograda''. U selu je ovaj deo poznat kao \u2018\u2019porta\u2019\u2019. Ube\u0111ena sam da je nama, onda\u0161njoj deci sa Kanala, to prednje crkveno dvori\u0161te uvek bilo od nekog velikog zna\u010daja \u2013 kako fizi\u010dki, tako i ''metafizi\u010dki\u2019\u2019. Pritom, ovde sada uop\u0161te ne zalazim u pojedina\u010dne veroispovesti i rituale vezane za crkvu, ve\u0107 isklju\u010divo mislim na tu fizi\u010dku teritoriju okru\u017eenu gustim jorgovanom. Mi, kao deca, bili smo deca i \u010detnika i partizana, romska deca, deca vernika i ateista, deca direktora i paora, deca policajaca, radnika i deca profesora. Sve te razlike, pa i one potonje koje su se razvijale me\u0111u nama silom prilika, nestajale su ba\u0161 u toj cvetnoj crkvenoj porti. Porodi\u010dna ku\u0107a je bila ( i jo\u0161 uvek je) na svega par metara od crkve i kao ve\u0107ina ku\u0107a koje su se gradile tamo krajem 80ih i 90ih godina, dugo godina je bila bez ograde, \u0161to je nama, kao deci, zna\u010dilo, jer smo mogli i sa svega 5 \u2013 6 godina \u2018\u2019oti\u0107i od ku\u0107e\u2019\u2019, odnosno, iz sopstvenog dvori\u0161ta i to ne kod nekog \u2019\u2019na sigurno\u2019\u2019 (npr. kod babe ili tetke.), ve\u0107 na jednu neutralnu teritoriju koja je podjednako pripadala svima nama \u2013 i meni i \u017deljku, i Bobanu i Bojanu, Slavi\u0161i, Mimiju i Toletu, Sonji i Nikoli, Verici i drugima. Taj deo je toliko bio na\u0161, de\u010diji, da se ja ne se\u0107am da je ikada odrasla osoba zakora\u010dila u portu (osim u izuzetnim prilikama, kakve su bile svadbe ili neki crkveni praznici). \u010cak bi i roditelji, ako bi i do\u0161li po nekog od nas ko je prekr\u0161io dogovoreno vreme za igru, stali na sam ulaz u portu ili na neki \u0107o\u0161ak i dovikivali da je vreme da se ide ku\u0107i. S vremena na vreme bilo je tu i nekih, za nas onda, \u2018\u2019uljeza\u2019\u2019, dece i omladine iz drugih krajeva sela, koji bi se, na biciklovima, okupili u toj na\u0161oj porti. Mi bismo se \u0161unjali po tom \u017ebunju i \u010dekali da svi odu kako bismo opet osvojili teritoriju. Sama porta je bila dovoljno prostrana i bilo je klupa\u2026ne se\u0107am se koliko, dve ili tri? Ali, se\u0107am se tog ogromnog drveta kraj jedne od klupa, ne znam da li je to bila lipa ili hrast, sa dve rupe u stablu, za koje je neko rekao da je to grom udario u gornji deo stabla, pa je munja iza\u0161la na donji deo stabla i otuda te dve rupe. Po svemu sude\u0107i , taj Neko je samo mogla biti na\u0161a Verica, avanturistkinja u du\u0161i. Nju je , do njene 13 godine, na nekom safariju u \u0110ur\u0111evu ujeo lav za nogu, a stigla je i do Bajage, jer se dru\u017eila sa njegovim sestrama, Vi\u0161njom i Jagodom (  <3 ) . Kad sam ve\u0107 kod Verice, verujem da je ona svima nama dala taj neki \u2018\u2019hardcore\u2019\u2019 momenat u detinjstvu, zbog \u010dega ona zaslu\u017euje i naro\u010ditu pa\u017enju. Ne znam da li je jo\u0161 uvek, ali je tada zaista bila posebna, ta na\u0161a Verica, bila je starija od nas i slu\u0161ala je metal \u2013 a mi smo se nje istovremeno i bojali i obo\u017eavali je. U zavisnosti koje od ta dva raspolo\u017eenja u odnosu na Vericu prevagne \u2013 mi smo se delili u klanove. Tako se desio i taj \u010duveni, mada sada mo\u017eda ve\u0107 i zaboravljen, projekat \u2018\u2019Voltron\u2019\u2019. Tih 90ih godina su se emitovali animirani (crtani) filmovi sa vozilima - robotima, a Voltron je bio Za\u0161titnik Univerzuma i mi bismo, tako inspirisani, \u2019\u2019zaratili\u2019\u2019 jedni sa drugima i podelili se u dva klana. Jedan klan je uvek predvodila Verica, a drugi naj\u010de\u0161\u0107e Sonja (mada sam ube\u0111ena da mnogo puta nije ni znala da je bila Glavna). Sedi\u0161ta ili ''hedkvotersi'' dva klana bile su dve razli\u010dite ku\u0107e na Kanalu, u izgradnji. Mimijeva i Bobanova. Od crvenih blokova i cigala pravili smo mo\u0107ne kompjuterske sisteme, sastajali se, crtali mape i planove i kuvali veliku zaveru za ru\u0161enje sistema. U to ratno doba u portu se nije zalazilo. Be\u0161e to suvi\u0161e prijateljsko mesto za na\u0161e megalomanske namere. Osim mo\u017eda par puta, kada se glavni okr\u0161aj desio ba\u0161 u porti i to tako \u0161to smo igrali \u2018\u2019izme\u0111u dve vatre\u2019\u2019 , ali onako grubo, jedni protiv drugih, a udarci loptom bili su agresivniji nego ina\u010de\u2026ali to je bilo to, to je bila odlu\u010duju\u0107a bitka. Ne se\u0107am se kako smo se mirili. Odlazili smo kod Bla\u017eenke, ona je bila u invalidskim kolicima, zbog \u010dega \u010desto nije mogla da u\u010destvuje u na\u0161im igrama i jurnjavama, pa je sedela ispred ku\u0107e. Sa porodicom je, tokom rata, do\u0161la iz Sarajeva. Bla\u017eenka je bila dosta starija od nas po godinama, ali u srcu je bila ve\u010dno dete, Tokom nesuglasica, odlazili smo kod nje. Bla\u017eenku su na\u0161e sva\u0111e toliko uzbu\u0111ivale, da je plakala i ljutila se na nas \u0161to se sva\u0111amo. Mislim da je ona \u010desto bila mirotvorac. U svakom slu\u010daju, sigurna sam da smo se toliko zaigrali, da bismo na kraju i zaboravili za\u0161to crtamo mape i za\u0161to \u0161pijuniramo drugi klan, valjda bi nam dosadilo sve to, pa bismo nastavili tamo gde smo stali pre operacije Voltron, sasvim spontano i prirodno, bez ikakve drame samog pomirenja. U mirnodopskim uslovima, deca sa Kanala naj\u010de\u0161\u0107e su igrala \u017emurke, a nedovr\u0161ene ku\u0107e, neogra\u0111ena dvori\u0161ta i na\u0161a porta davali su bezbroj mogu\u0107nosti za skrivanje i potragu. S prole\u0107a, li\u0161\u0107e jorgovana bi ozelenelo, a jorgovan procvetao, a de\u010dija ma\u0161ta bi divljala. U tom \u017ebunju krile su se na\u0161e veli\u010danstvene tajne dvorane, kancelarije i kuhinje, zajedni\u010dke prostorije, a svako je mogao da ima i svoju, da se \u0161\u0107u\u0107uri u rastinju, da bere jorgovan, tra\u017ee\u0107i cvet sa pet latica, da za\u017emuri i zamisli \u017eelju, pa cveti\u0107 ubaci u majicu\u2026a imali smo pregr\u0161t \u017eelja, jer su majice i duksevi bili puni jorgovana. Tokom sezone svadbi, porta je bila kao ostrvo sa blagom. Nakon \u0161to bi se svatovi razi\u0161li, a iza sebe ostavili pobacane kovanice, \u0161arene trake i poluprazne (ili polupune  ;-) ) plasti\u010dne \u010da\u0161e, mi bismo tragali za tim ostacima veselja i pravili sopstveni after. Sli\u010dno je bilo i leti, u avgustu, kad je seoska Slava. Odrastati, makar jedan dan, kraj slavaro\u0161kih tezgi sa \u0161arenim bombonama i igra\u010dkama, be\u0161e posebna privilegija. A kad \u2019\u2019slavaro\u0161i\u2019\u2019 odu, pa iza sebe ostave \u0161arenilo od sme\u0107a u porti i oko nje, tek su to bile potrage i nade da je neko mo\u017eda ne\u0161to zaboravio ili da je nekome mo\u017eda ispala neka igra\u010dka. Zimi, porta pod snegom je na\u0161em kraju davala taj neki bajkoviti \u2018'vajb'' i tako smo bili svi ponosni, jer eto, mi smo imali ne\u0161to, \u0161to mo\u017eda drugi nisu imali (bar smo tako onda mislili), imali smo na\u0161u portu u jednom vrtlogu nema\u0161tine i svakakvih podela. Mi smo imali jedno \u0161a\u0161avo detinjstvo, sasvim bezbedno pod granama jorgovana. I dugo godina smo je imali, tu na\u0161u portu, \u010dak i kada je de\u010dija graja utihnula, samo na neki druga\u010diji na\u010din. Onda je porta imala ve\u0107 neku drugu funkciju, onda smo se ba\u0161 skrivali tamo, da popu\u0161imo koju cigaru, ukrademo neki poljubac na klupi ili da podelimo neke mladala\u010dke depre koje su nas tada \u0161ibale. Godinama kasnije, kada smo se svi razi\u0161li, po okolnim gradovima, po drugim dr\u017eavama, \u010dak i po drugim kontinentima, valjda u potrazi za svojim laticama jorgovana, porta je i dalje bila tu. I kao \u0161to ''sve te\u010de, sve se menja'', tako se i scenografija jednog detinjstva zauvek promenila pre nekoliko dana, kada su tu na\u0161u portu od jorgovana posekli i izvadili ono drve\u0107e. Vi\u0161e nema \u010dak ni onog magi\u010dnog drveta koje je pre\u017eivelo udar groma. ''Pa i onako taj jorgovan ne cveta ve\u0107 godinama'', ka\u017eu. Trenutno je sve ravno, nekako ''golo'' i prazno. Bar za sada. ''Nema veze, bi\u0107e sad kao na trgu u Be\u010deju'', govore jedni, ''Ne, bi\u0107e kao korzo u \u010curugu'', govore drugi. Mislim, kako god da bude, nadam se da \u0107e biti prostora za neke druge pri\u010de i neka druga detinjstva. I nisam sad u nekom velikom pathosu, samo su nai\u0161li ti sentimentalni talasi se\u0107anja... A pitanja sti\u017eu i sa drugog kraja sveta: da li je istina da nema vi\u0161e na\u0161e porte? I to ne pita neki uskoro \u010detrdesetogodi\u0161njak, to pita ono dete sa Kanala. Pa, nema vi\u0161e porte. Ali, bi\u0107e ne\u0161to drugo. Uvek bude. A portu smo sa\u010duvali, eto, u glavama, na po kojoj slici, i evo par latica jorgovana i u ovoj pri\u010di. ::: Poslednji put sam pro\u0161la kroz portu letos. Tamo sam zatekla momka, kako name\u0161ta \u0161ator pored klupe, a videla sam da je izvadio i neke kamperske lonce i poklopce. U razgovoru koji je trajao samo par minuta, saznam da je on Belgijanac koji je krenuo na put oko sveta, na motoru, pa je re\u0161io da se tu malo odmori i da preno\u0107i. Raspitivao se za WiFi. Preporu\u010dih mu par drugih obli\u017enjih lokacija, gde ima Internet i gde bi mo\u017eda mogao kvalitetnije da se odmori. Znate \u0161ta je odgovorio? \n\n''No, it's ok.

I use \"challenges\" as I don't often see things as hardship or miserable or unfortunate endeavors :slight_smile: etc.\n\nI enjoy time with my partner too, we have so much more of it now :slight_smile:, we also have some fights but the outcome is always positive. It is also a good test for many people, they will realise if they really want to spend time with their partners :stuck_out_tongue:.  \n\nWell right now the challenge is to keep engaged in local projects and move forward. This new uncertainty has created am obsession about the present state (so much fear and paranoia) and also priorities have changed for everyone.\n\n[quote=\"MariaEuler, post:11, topic:12843\"]\nThere are the people we live with directly and then everyone else, no matter if, in another city, another country or another continent is as near.

It is very silly because the measures taken by the government make no sense when you consider the people at the shop registers touch everything and everyone through the stuff bought. I have friends who came back to Belgium from Milan and Rome, no check ups whatsoever. I have 2 friends who came from Mexico, went through 3 airports and had contact or with literally few hundred people in 2 days...no check ups upon landing to Brussels.\nMany examples like that, one wonders what are people thinking.\n\nMost of us are social beings so, by necessity probably, we become closer now with people all over the world. I usually tend to spend time with people i align with in different ways anyways. Because the nature of interaction has changed as well, i guess we easily feel closer to someone purely for those reasons. We lost something, we compensate. I enjoy spending time with people I appreciate in different ways and I give a lot of hugs so...let's say I feel the impact of this change.", "created_at": "2020-03-21 10:40:39.174828", "updated_at": "2020-03-21 10:40:39.174828", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 498, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 26.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [71942], "is_reply_to": [71942], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87729, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13190, "post_number": 58, "raw": "From Maria: \u201cDue to Eriks experince working with a tech company to include his research it might be extra interessting to people developing an application or online service/project.

Thanks for the heads. This sounds awesome and I definitely think it should be pushed through. I am sorry I could not play much of a role or contribute to the development of this workshop at this stage. I so wish I could participate in this venture.\n\nI'm personally more focused on engagement, participation and inclusion in Science, and testing new methods of engagement. I've just launched a project that is installed in 3 countries with interrelated themes that you may find interest, but its too early to provide any feedback just yet. Each country's thematic focus follows: South Africa: Mental Illness as relevant to TB/HIV; Botswana: Mental Health and TB; India: Mental Health as relative to Climate Change and Food Security. Each team has autonomy in addressing and rolling out its engagement activities in direct partnership with Communities, Scientists/Institutions and Artists. Street Arts, Festival Vibes and Celebration of mutual learning, rather than packaged learning structured in a standardised pedagogy (i.e. teacher-learner relationships), are being explored. In the very same vein we're trying to take the same approach to Sexual and Reproductive Health engagement in Tanzania, whereby community members are collaboratively steering the project from assessment to design to final evaluation. I'm unsure if these kinds of explorations are of interest to you all, at this early stage.\n\nI'm also working on various projects, such as Photovoice and other participatory media for the African Health Research Institute, to understand post-trial socio-political dynamic and responsibilities toward ex-patients and their families. This relates to multi-stakeholder involvement including government (local, regional, national) , funder, implementing partners, scientific institution, etc. and exploration of the responsibilities of these stakeholders to ex-patients in rural Kwa Zulu Natal, South Africa. I'll also try to understand how, or if at all, institutional practice transforms based on these interactions.\n\nI'd be very interest in testing and playing around in other spaces as well, by working directly with others. I'm sorry for throwing in my 2 cents rather late, but perhaps for this endeavour I may not be very useful.\n\nDo let us know if this has been submitted. I know some of the organizers/presenters, and shall be name dropping you all. Georgia Bladon (WT), Imran Khan (WT) , Ali Floyd (Uni of Dundee) and other Engagement Staff. Do let me know if I can be of any assistance. I planned to attend the Event but my current project commitments may not allow it.\n\nI'd love to learn about the approach you'll be exploring within the workshop as well.", "created_at": "2018-02-18 08:40:19.610524", "updated_at": "2018-02-18 08:40:19.610524", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 444, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 86.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [41706], "is_liked_by": [3904, 4034], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28846, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3221, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>Good job!</b>\n\nNoemi, Romania being overrepresented is a <em>good</em> thing, it means you are doing a great job :D\n\n<em>\"As for the age data, indeed a minority of people filled that field in their user profiles, but unfortunately there's nothing we can add there manually :-(\"</em>\n\nBut I thought that was the idea, adding things manually?

One reason to go towards graph databases is as you mention, to take early enough in the process, the \"heavy lifting\". One observation is key here: Discourse does not contain any information on the interactions between users, ans even on the interaction between tags. This is information you need to derive from Discourse content. Now, once you have stored Discourse into graph form, in graph terms the user-user graph or the tag-tag graph is obtained by projecting two mode graphs onto one-mode graphs.

How to use Markdown formatting in Arabic (or other RTL) text?](#heading--3)**\n\n----\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. How to write a post in Arabic (and other right-to-left scripts)?</h2>\n\nThis exclusively shows how to write a whole post in right-to-left script. There will be another question dealing with mixed text direction input, which is quite confusing.\n\n1. **Open the Discourse editor** to create or edit a topic or comment.\n\n2. **For input: Configure the writing direction for the editor textbox.** You have two options:\n\n    * If you write right-to-left by default whenever you use a browser, you will already have configured right-to-left as default writing direction for embedding, usually by choosing your browser language.\n    * If you want to set the direction only for this one time, right-click into the editor's left textbox and choose \"Writing Direction \u2192 Right to Left\" (tested in Chrome, will be similar in other browsers).\n\n3. **For output: Use the text direction tag.** The last step will only show proper right-to-left text in the editor, not in the preview on its right side or the final rendering after saving. For that, you have again two options:\n\n    * Before you start writing, click the \"right-aligned lines\" in the editor's toolbar to create a `[text-direction=rtl] \u2026 [/text-direction]` tag, and write your content inside. (To apply this tag, you could also select all your text when you're done writing and then use this editor button, but it would needlessly create one such tag around each paragraph.) When using this technique, you currently have to work around two issues (until we can resolve them):\n        * Add a blank line before the start of the `[text-direction=rtl]` tag, or it will not have any effect for right-aligning your content, in case there is a Markdown list item right before it. ([issue #92](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/92))\n        * Add a blank line right after the opening `[text-direction=rtl]` tag, or no Markdown formatting would work. ([issue #91](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/91))\n    * You can put the character sequence `&#x202b;` at the beginning of a paragraph to place the Unicode \"Right-to-Left Embedding\" character there. It will control the direction of this paragraph,  until it is automatically reset at the end of it (`<br/>` or an empty line). While this solution also works, it prevents you from using Markdown formatting for lists, as that needs the line to start with a number or asterisk character. You could still use HTML tags for list though. But better stick with the first option \u2013 we document this second one only for completeness \u2026\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. How to write mixed LTR / RTL content (say, Latin and Arabic scripts)?</h2>\n\nHere are three concepts that help to understand what is \"text direction\". (@matthias made up these concepts, there are probably better / correct official names for them.)\n\n1. **Character order** is the order how you consume characters when reading them in the right sequence. Character order is exactly the same as how characters are internally stored by the computer, namely, as a Unicode string. Only when writing them to the screen and reading them, there can be jumps due to changes of text direction within the string.\n\n2. **Character writing direction** determines if, after entering one character, the caret that marks where the next character will be inserted will be to the right or to the left of the inserted character. This depends only on the script (LTR or RTL) of the character you just entered, and can not be configured. (There are some edge cases, for example characters like \"`/`\", \"`<`\" etc. that are agnostic about writing direction.) This character writing direction is also utilized by the computer when writing characters to the screen, one by one. So it can never happen that a LTR word is displayed RTL, for example \"house\" as \"esuoh\".\n\n3. **Paragraph writing direction** or (in official Unicode terms) \"embedding\" direction determines how, in a paragraph of mixed RTL and LTR sequences, the sequences are written into a paragraph. This is a display property of the paragraph, and can be changed around at will. It can even be different for input (editor box) and output (browser text), and normally will be chosen based on the main language of the whole text, or in some cases, of the individual paragraph. Here's an illustration of the two display styles, which can be switched by changing the writing direction of a textbox (for input, in the context menu) or HTML element (for output, using a tag / attribute):\n\n        as LTR paragraph: | LTR1 RTL1 LTR2 RTL2            |\n        as RTL paragraph: |            RTL2 LTR2 RTL1 LTR1 |\n\n4. **Paragraph alignment** simply means if lines are aligned to the left or right edge of the page. It is a separate concept, but configured automatically by choosing your paragraph writing direction. (This works both for input and output, independently.)\n\nNow to write mixed LTR / RTL content, the rules are simple to understand:\n\n* **Configure paragraph writing direction for input** depending on your preferred writing direction, or if you like that better, on the main script of each paragraph. See \"How to write a post in Arabic\" above for how to configure this. If different paragraphs use different main scripts, you may have to switch writing directions when moving to edit a new paragraph. You can do that simply from the right-click menu in most browsers, as often as you like.\n\n* **Configure paragraph writing direction for output** depending on the main script in your whole text. See \"How to write a post in Arabic\" above for how to configure this.\n\nBut it will be confusing sometimes, so you will need some special tricks:\n\n* **Use another editor for difficult cases of mixed LTR / RTL strings.** When one string has both left-to-right (\"Latin\") and right-to-left (\"Arabic\") characters, esp. with frequent switches, the browser default implementation for editing that is quite a nightmare (confusing caret jumps when selecting, entering characters etc.). Solution: Copy&amp;paste the full title to [this online editor](http://www.arabic-keyboard.org/editor/), edit there, copy&amp;paste it back.\n\n* **Prefer Markdown over HTML.** The Discourse editor accepts both, but Markdown seems preferable as the special characters it needs do not introduce \"change of text direction\", unlike HTML tag names due to their Latin characters. So, less mixed LTR / RTL mix, and less confusion when selecting text etc..\n\n* **Select first when deleting content.** When editing mixed LTR / RTL content and not being very used to it, it will be confusing that the \"Backspace\" and \"Delete\" keys change the direction they operate in based on the direction of text you are in. So you will often hit the wrong one. To prevent this, select text to delete first, then press \"Delete\" to remove the whole selection, and only that.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. How to use Markdown formatting in Arabic (or other RTL) text?</h2>\n\nYou can use character-based formatting (bold, italic, links etc.) as normal. The special characters used for that do not introduce a change of text direction, so no confusing jumps will happen when selecting such text. (Exception: Latin characters for link URLs.)\n\nHowever, when you want to use paragraph-based formatting (lists, blockquote, headers), Markdown needs two things:\n\n* The special formatting characters (like \"`*`\" for a list item) have to be at the start of the line. So, you can't use the Unicode right-to-left embedding character `&#x202b;` to create a RTL paragraph writing direction in the output. Instead use the `[text-direction=rtl] \u2026 [/text-direction]` tag from the \"right-aligned lines\" editor button.\n\n* Lists and pre-formatted paragraphs (\"those indented with four spaces\") need an empty line above the first list item. Together with the last point, this means the text you enter into your editor to get a two-item list should look exactly like this (assuming RTL writing direction in your editor):\n\n[text-direction=rtl]\n\n    [text-direction=rtl]\n    \n    * \u062a\u062d\u062f\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0631\u0648\u0629 \u062d\u0633\u0646\n    * \u062a\u062d\u062f\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0631\u0648\u0629 \u062d\u0633\u0646\n    [/text-direction]\n[/text-direction]", "created_at": "2017-07-22 12:29:40.123084", "updated_at": "2019-03-06 13:33:18.545420", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1403, "wiki": true, "reads": 17, "score": 13008.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70591, "user_id": 2536, "topic_id": 12699, "post_number": 2, "raw": "awesome! see you on march 02. looking forward to catch up with you guys and the project", "created_at": "2020-02-26 09:23:13.877103", "updated_at": "2020-02-26 09:23:13.877103", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60743, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 11022, "post_number": 6, "raw": "@Hugi, as we found our developer for this already, [tell](https://meta.discourse.org/t/130238) the Discourse Meta community that the call is closed?\n\n[quote=\"gdpelican, post:5, topic:11022\"]Angus\u2019s suggestion [here](https://meta.discourse.org/t/paid-form-to-post-content-to-discourse/130238/2?u=gdpelican) is a very good one; I\u2019ve worked with both him and that plugin in the past, and both are great.[/quote]\n\nNo doubts about the quality of the plugin and its author \u2026 still I think it does not fit well into our software infrastructure. I will  explain \u2026 but, first of all, hello and welcome from me :) I'm the guy in Edgeryders who has to try keeping all our IT infrastructure organized \u2026\n\nI'll just list my reasons in no particular order and then let's see if that persuades you:\n\n* **Effort comparison.** The Custom Wizard plugin would need the following extensions to work within our setup: (1) action type for user account creation at the end, as [mentioned by Angus](https://meta.discourse.org/t/130238/2), (2) custom action implementation of that account creation action because [we use SSO accounts](/-/7419#heading--3) so account creation has to be done remotely at the SSO provider side for which we now have [a custom API endpoint](/t/-/7904#heading--3-4). The custom wizard platform is a more generic solution, which is nice to have but also takes more effort to adapt (rule of thumb \u2026). So the effort for both variants is comparable.\n\n* **Core and periphery: what goes where.** For this you need a bit of backstory: the previous (2012-2017) version of this web platform was built on, of all things, Drupal. When we made that decision, Discourse was not around yet, and we also initially liked the idea that admin users could adapt data types, forms, behavior and other aspects of the user interface using the admin interface, without having to do programming. That turned out to be a perfect recipe for a buggy mess of a software :smile: and we're now really staying away from \"user configurable forms and data types\" inside our core platform. The core data of Discourse is posts and users, with the occasional custom user record field \u2013 nice and clean! Discourse and other \"new wave single purpose\" applications are great because they do one thing very well, instead of trying to do everything and failing spectacularly (like Drupal).\n\n    On a tangent: The failure of the \"configuration over programming\" approach taken by Drupal, at least as regards our use case, also means that I'm now much more inclined towards small, flexible software components that need programming for adaptations, rather than complex, generic components (like form builders) that supposedly need no programming but then always turn out to be just a bit too limited for a use case to _really_ need no programming \u2026\n\n    Now it certainly would not do harm to have one form builder plugin inside Discourse \u2013 it's just that I try to establish this general architecture of keeping Discourse very close to its core function as a forum, while keeping peripheral data and features (forms, presentation websites, surveys etc.) to other independent web applications.\n\n* **Stand-alone software or not?** The Custom Wizard plugin has an unusual \"semi-independent\" software architecture: it is its own Ember application, but configurable from inside Discourse under the `/wizard/` route. I understand where that comes from, as it's a generalization of the Discourse setup wizard, which necessarily had to be a separate Ember application. (And we do a similar thing with our [annotation system](https://github.com/edgeryders/annotator_store-gem) for Discourse by embedding a Rails engine into the Discourse interface under `/annotator/`.)\n\n    However for this use case, we anticipate quite several (>10) future deployments based on this form software over the years, most of which will be in close connection with project-specific small custom websites that have nothing to do with Discourse and are made using Vue.js. With that in mind, I think for us it makes sense to go all the way to independence: the survey / form software would only talk to Discourse by API, not sharing a admin user login or data storage with the Discourse database. It's just the usual \"high cohesion, loose coupling\" principle of object oriented design, applied to applications \u2026\n\n* **Standardization.** As an internal standard, we have Ruby (with Rails) for backend and scripting work and JavaScript (with Vue.js) for frontend work. I'm a huge fan of standards in IT, even if just within one organization: it helps with interoperability of components, finding and keeping developers, the economics of learning new technology, re-usability of the hosting setup on our server etc.. That would be a reason to keep with the Vue.js approach for this little project, esp. given that there is [previous work](/t/10217/146) inside our organization to combine it with for a joint effort.\n\n    Now if something makes sense to just add to Discourse Core or an existing Discourse plugin, we'll gladly deviate from our standard and use the Ember framework. Because then it's a one-off project for an external developer, it will live in the upstream code base and we create no future legacy for our organization. That can't work though if we expect that piece of software to be something we'll work on and constantly expand though, such as in this case of the form-building component.\n\nTo sum up, I propose to not use the Custom Wizard Plugin for this project but rather go with the original proposal for a small independent Vue.js application, connected to Discourse by API.\n\nAnyway, thank you for bringing that plugin to our attention. It definitely has its uses, and we may consider it for what we consider core functionality of this platform. (For example we use a form to collect consent to data usage in research before a user posts for the first time. With an added \"show before posting\" action, the Custom Wizard Plugin would be a good candidate to replace our current implementation of that feature.)", "created_at": "2019-10-05 21:54:50.994732", "updated_at": "2019-10-05 22:05:10.749993", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1028, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 27.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [60741], "is_reply_to": [60741, 60703], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35279, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 6848, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Yes!

Why we are doing this</h2>\n\nEU research projects are accountable to the funding agency, the European Commission, in a highly structured way. Each project's documentation should be ready for a full audit. An audit is a process in which project partners are required to produce every single invoice, timesheet, receipt etc. for the whole project. An audit can happen at any time within five years of the date at which a project ended. \n\nWe want to be producing project documentation in such a way that an auditor would immediately understand the work done. The main rationale is to **explicitly connect effort (work time, expenses etc.) to results (WPs, deliverables etc.)**. For example, the following are examples of clear, accountable reporting: \n\n* reporting 3 hours on 2019-04-18 for writing and revising deliverable 5.3\n* claiming a refund for travel expenses for the trip to Berlin of 2019-06-03, to raise awareness of the project with the hacker community, as per task 2.4 on engagement\n\nTo achieve this, **please use the free text fields to explain what you have been doing**. \n\nIn this way, the auditor can trace what we have been doing (effort) to what has been done (result).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Preparing the reporting tools</h2>\n\nThis is a task for an administrator / project manager, to be done once at the start of a Horizon 2020 project:\n\n1. **Sign up on [SignRequest](https://signrequest.com).** Create one single account of type \"Professional\". Everyone else who needs to sign our sign requests can do so without any account or optionally the free account.\n\n3. **Install the \"Financial reporting utility\".** This is our custom tool. \n\n    (This is not yet finished, but once it is it will be published on [github.com/edgeryders](http://github.com/edgeryders) together with installation instructions.)\n\n4. **Create \"unbillable\" tasks in FreeAgent.** These will be used for time tracking there by people who want to do that in FreeAgent (which is not mandatory).\n\n    1. Log in to FreeAgent.\n\n    2. Go to \"Work \u2192 Projects \u2192 (select your project)\"\n\n    3. Click \"Add New \u2192 Task\" in the top right.\n\n    4. Enter a work package name as the task name.\n\n    5. Untick \"Is this task billable?\" (See \"Design rationale\" below for reasons.)\n\n    6. Leave \"Rate\" at \"0.00\". (See \"Design rationale\" below for reasons.)\n\n    7. Click \"Create and Add Another\", and repeat for all work packages of the project.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Worktime</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Tracking your worktime</h3>\n\nAs per the official requirements, you have to track your worktime for Horizon 2020 projects split by project and work package. To be better prepared for an audit (see [section 1](#heading--1)), we require you to track your worktime with one additional level of granularity below \"work package\". This can be for example sub-tasks or comments to time entries, depending on what fits best for your time tracking tool.\n\nTo sum up, you have to **report eligible hours worked once per month** (the total number of hours reported for a project needs to correspond to the amount of your pay stated in the contract. In Horizon2020 projects the hourly rate is 41,86 eur), together with the following information about each time entry:\n\n1. Project\n2. Work Package (pay special attention to selecting the correct WP)\n3. One more level of detail: task, comment or similar (ONLY hours worked for the specific project can be charged to it. NEVER declare activities outside of the scope of your work for the project. Pay attention to details such as: when having a meeting with someone and reporting your time for it, make sure it corresponds to what the other person declared, especially in terms of date and duration).\n\nTracking your worktime in even finer level of granularity is entirely up to you and such data does not have to be transmitted. Likewise, tracking worktime that is not eligible for reimbursement (because it's outside the scope of your contract) is entirely up to you, but can give you a better idea of your earnings of course. However, the amount on your invoice needs to correspond to the number of hours reported in the signed timesheets and the hourly rate.\n\nIf you are working on multiple projects, make sure that the total amount of the hours declared per month is in accordance with the national legislation from your country to avoid working overtime. This can be checked by generating timesheets for all projects per month and adjusting accordingly before signing the timesheets.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--3-1-choosing\">Choosing a time tracker</h4>\n\nThe choice of time tracking tool is entirely up to you. We show the process using our FreeAgent account below, which is free to use for you (we gave you an account there already, to enter your expenses and invoices).\n\nIf you choose another tool, make sure it fulfills the following minimum requirements:\n\n* Tracking your activity in one more level of detail below the \"work package\" level. This can be for example by using another level in a project-subproject hierarchy, or by adding notes to time entries (as done in FreeAgent with so-called time slips).\n\n* Able to summarize your worktime entries in a four-level logical hierarchy: (1) project, (2) month, (3) work package, (4) activity description. Because these are the numbers you'll need to fill in the signed time reports.\n\n* Recording at least the daily aggregate worktime for your time entries (at level 4 of the above hierarchy). There is no need to track all start and end times; for example, FreeAgent does not.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--3-1-freeagent\">Time tracking with FreeAgent</h4>\n\nIf you use FreeAgent as your time tracker, there are two small advantages: we already have set up the projects and work packages you can use for tracking time; and you will not have to upload original and exported data of your time tracker once a year, as we already have access to it via FreeAgent. Disadvantage: the interface is not that comfortable or efficient.\n\nTo use it:\n\n1. **Log in** to FreeAgent.\n\n2. **Go to \"Work \u2192 Time Tracking\".** You have now three options to proceed. In all cases, select the work package as the FreeAgent \"Task\" to which your worktime belongs. This is mandatory according to the reporting requirements we have.\n\n    * Option 1: Select project and task and click \"Start Timer\". This will use FreeAgent as a time tracker. To stop tracking, click on the \"pause\" button that appears next to your newly created timeslip.\n\n        <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b7a0cf5ac8b68214b9ac0e2fbd4bf6aa60cb8d10.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"37\">\n\n    * Option 2: Select project and task; fill in the worktime field and if necessary the date. Click \"Add Timeslip\" (the \"Start Timer\" button changes its function when you add a worktime figure). This allows to record the worktime for a single day.\n\n    * Option 3: Click \"Add Weekly Timesheet\". This allows to efficiently take over your worktime tracking from another tracking application, and may be your preferred choice if you are already using one.\n\n3. **Add a comment.** Add a few words as to what you used the time for, referring to Tasks and deliverables as much as possible (see [section 1.](#heading--1) for examples and an explanation of why this is necessary). For this, use the comment field at the bottom of the timeslip form:\n\n    <img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e978e9d23c2700231fca8c7bc0194cfb9da10324.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"156\">\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--3-1-tom-ui\">Time tracking with tom-ui</h4>\n\n[tom](https://github.com/jansorg/tom) with [tom-ui](https://github.com/jansorg/tom-ui) is an open source time tracker tool with both a graphical and a command-line interface. It runs under Mac OS X, Linux (with Ubuntu packages) and should also run under Windows (but no installer is available so far). It is compact and works nicely but is still in the early stages of development, so be sure to make regular backups.\n\nYou can use tom-ui as your time tracker, but unlike when using FreeAgent you'll have to generate the monthly timesheet report yourself when requested. Here's how to do that:\n\n1. Go to \"Reports \u2192 Create project report \u2026\".\n\n2. At the top, enter enter as the title of the report: \"Timesheet for _[your full name]_\".\n\n3. Under the description field near the top, enter the following (the single-line formatting is a workaround for [tom-ui issue #104](https://github.com/jansorg/tom-ui/issues/104)):\n\n    For NGI Forward:\n\n    ```plaintext\n    CONTACT: European Commission | PROJECT: NGI FORWARD 825652 | BENEFICIARY: Edgeryders O\u00dc, Estonia\n    ```\n\n    For POPREBEL:\n\n    ```plaintext\n    CONTACT: European Commission | PROJECT: POPREBEL 822682 | BENEFICIARY: Edgeryders O\u00dc, Estonia\n    ```\n4. Under \"Project\", choose the relevant project and check \"Include subprojects\".\n\n5. Under \"Time Entries\", check \"Filter by date\" and choose the first and last day of the last month as the filtering period.\n\n6. Under \"Splitting\", choose only \"Project\".\n\n7. Under \"Template\", choose \"timelog\".\n\n8. Under \"Template\", make sure that \"Show Summary\" is enabled.\n\n9. In the bottom left, click \"Update report\" to apply all changes.\n\n10. In the bottom left, choose \"Save report as HTML\" from the button dropdown.\n\n11. Open the exported HTML file in a text editor and make the following changes:\n\n    * Remove the CSS rule `th {whitespace: nowrap}` (l. 61). (This is a workaround for [tom-ui issue #92](https://github.com/jansorg/tom-ui/issues/92).)\n\n    * Add the following HTML snippet just before `</body>`. You can also insert the relevant names behind \"Consultant Name:\" and \"Approver Name:\" already here in HTML; then the people signing the document will have one field less to fill via SignRequest.\n\n        ```\n        <div class=\"bucket\">\n\n            <table>\n                <tbody>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th class=\"notes\">Consultant Name: </th>\n                        <th class=\"notes\">Approver Name: </th>\n                      </tr>\n\n                      <tr>\n                          <th class=\"notes\">Date: </th>\n                          <th class=\"notes\">Date: </th>\n                      </tr>\n\n                      <tr>\n                          <th class=\"notes\">Consultant Signature: </th>\n                          <th class=\"notes\">Approver Signature: </th>\n                      </tr>\n                </tbody>\n            </table>\n\n        </div>\n        ```\n\n    * If there are very long URLs that become partially hidden in the PDF export (and hide other text as well by enlarging the table size past 100%), insert zero-width whitespace characters `&#8203;` at suitable locations to tell the browser how to break the URL into multiple lines. (This is a workaround for [tom-ui issue #92](https://github.com/jansorg/tom-ui/issues/92)).\n\n12. Convert the adapted HTML file to a PDF file.\n\n13. Send the PDF file to the person who requested it.\n\n14. You will now receive a SignRequest for that document. Then just add your name, the current date and your signature to the document via SignRequest, in the fields prepared for that.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Signing time records</h3>\n\nThis process must be done **once per month**, where you will sign the time records for the past calendar month. To simplify the task for you as a collaborator, you only have to follow the second part of this process.\n\n\n### <h4 id=\"heading--3-2-admin\">For the Research Network admin</h4>\n\nThe first part is for an **Edgeryders admin** person. At beginning of a new calendar month, do the following for every (collaborator, project) combination for the previous calendar month:\n\n1. **Generate reports** for each collaborator and project either from FreeAgent, or in case where a collaborator uses other timetracking tools request the document(s) from the collaborator.\n\n    To generate a report in FreeAgent, go to \"Work \u2192 Time Tracking \u2192 Create Report\" and [create a timesheet report](https://support.freeagent.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001220090-Timesheet-reporting). For time reporting purposes, use the following parameters as needed:\n\n    * Timeframe: Last Month\n    * Project: select POPREBEL or NGI Forward\n    * User: select the user to generate the report for\n\n    Save the reports as files on your computer, and give them a filename in the following format: `Time Records - [project] - [collaborator] - [yyyy-mm].pdf`. Project is either `POPREBEL` or `NGI`. This file naming is important to keep order in our SignRequest archive.\n\n2. **Log in** to the Edgeryders [SignRequest](https://signrequest.com/) account.\n\n3. **Add document to sign and enter signers.** This happens on the SignRequest frontpage. Select \"Only others\" and under \"Contact(s)\" enter the e-mail addresses of the collaborator and her \"supervisor\".\n\n    The \"supervisor\" is the collaborator's team leader. If the collaborator is herself the team leader, the \"supervisor\" is the research director. If the collaborator is herself the research director, then \"supervisor\" can be any other management board member of the company.\n\n    It helps to make a list of the e-mail addresses at first and then to work through it every month.\n\n4. **Prepare the document.** Click \"Prepare document\" and adapt the following options: \n\n    * Signing order of the signers, so that the collaborator signs first.\n\n    * \"Send automatic reminders: yes\". This makes SignRequest send them e-mail reminders every few days, starting at day 3.\n\n    * Place the fields for name, date and signature. This is optional, but will save the signers some time.\n\n5. **Prepare document and click \"Send\".**\n\n6. **Make sure people signed** after about 10-14 days, and if necessary, follow up with them.\n\n\n### <h4 id=\"heading--3-2-collaborators\">For collaborators and team leaders</h4>\n\nThe second part is for the **collaborator** and **team leader**:\n\n1. **Wait for the sign request.** It will come once per month by e-mail.\n\n2. **Collaborator: fill and sign** the document.  To get help with SignRequest, go [here](https://signrequest.com/en/how-it-works/).\n\n3. **Team leader: check and sign** the document afterwards. Check the document first \u2013 especially make sure that the reported values are in conformance with the collaborator's documented leave times, if any.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt this point, the signed time records are stored together with their audit logs in the Edgeryders SignRequest account. Leave them there and don't delete them from there until 5 years after the project, as required \u2013 this is the best way to preserve a fully auditable document trail. When the time comes to create the next report, we will also use them to fill in the worktimes to report.\n\nIn addition, for our own reference and backpups, all signed documents are also synced automatically from SignRequest to [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fBBLEw7gOMk7fh3dJtQPKparckpJxtBV). This is a folder in the personal \"My Drive\" Google Drive of user admin@edgeryders.eu, and shared with all directors plus @marina. It cannot be located in a Google Team Drive because that is not supported by SignRequest. And anyway, since in principle we are able to modify the files in there, these are not the authoritative versions \u2013 for that, always look into SignRequest directly.\n\nFor additional hints and tips about SignRequest, see: [Company Manual: Signing for the Company](/t/-/6168#heading--4-1).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Invoices and expenses</h2>\n\nThese are the steps required by every project collaborator. Like worktime, costs can only be included in the reporting period (here: 6 or 12 months) where they occurred, so it's important to enter an invoice quickly into FreeAgent after creating it. The project manager will however inform collaborators in time when a reporting deadline is approaching.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-1\">4.1. Entering your invoice</h3>\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--4-1-collaborators\">For collaborators and team leaders</h4>\n\nAs a collaborator, follow this process:\n\n1. **Calculate how much to invoice.** For this, sum up the time of your signed time records for the invoice's period and project. SignRequest e-mailed you a copy of the signed documents after everyone signed. \n\n2. **Write your invoice [with the usual process](/t/7394).** The following notes apply:\n\n    * **Invoice quarterly.** To minimize admin efforts, our usual payment schedule for our Horizon 2020 projects is quarterly. So you would invoice for January to March, April to June, July to September, October to December.\n\n    * **Invoice calendar months fully or not at all.** In all cases, please only invoice once you can put all work of a calendar month into your invoice. This allows the project manager to quickly check that your invoice is correct, by comparing with your signed time records which are summed up by month.\n\n    * **One invoice per project**. FreeAgent does not allow us to split a bill between two separate projects. For this reason, collaborators need to send to Edgeryders one invoice per each project they have contributed to in that period.\n\n    * **Dealing with multiple work packages.** It is ok to invoice for multiple work packages *of one project* in a single invoice. And you do *not* have to make separate invoice positions for each work package.\n\n    * **No need to attach timesheets.** You do _not_ have to attach the signed timesheets to your invoice PDF. Anyone who needs to check your invoice can look at the official version of these timesheets in SignRequest resp. on paper.\n\n3. **Register your invoice** as a bill in FreeAgent for payment by Edgeryders, by following [our usual process](/t/7394).\n\n4. **Special case: if your invoice is not for worktime.** In the exceptional case that your invoice is not for time-tracked worktime on the basis of a contract with Edgeryders, write the correct `h2020_costtype=\u2026` value into the comment field of the bill. Potential values are documented under [4.2.](#heading--4-2). This is only needed for cases where the value is different from `h2020_costtype=personnel`, which is assumed as the default for invoices.\n\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--4-1-admin\">For the Research Network admin</h4>\n\nAs the Edgeryders admin person, follow this process when seeing  a new bill related to a H2020 project in FreeAgent:\n\n1. **Get the corresponding signed time records** for the bill. This is stored in Edgeryders' [SignRequest](https://signrequest.com/) account. Since time records are monthly and bills quarterly, you have to find three time records. If no such time records exists or if they are not properly signed yet, the bill cannot be paid.\n\n    In a few cases, the signed time records will be in paper form. In that case, scan them in and create a PDF document from them.\n\n2. **Open the bill** and confirm that:\n\n    1. the number of hours on the signed time records corresponds to the number of hours invoiced for the respective calendar months\n    2. the number of hours worked corresponds to the amount of money billed\n\n3. **Combine bill and time records** into a single PDF document. You'll need to install a software that can combine PDFs. Do not use an [online service for this](https://www.google.com/search?q=combine+PDF+online), as it would expose personal information of collaborators to, umh, unauthorized parties.\n\n4. **Upload the bill + time records document** into FreeAgent again, replacing the original bill there. This way, we have it all nicely together in the case of an audit.\n\n5. **Add to FreeAgent where the time records are found.** This should be added to the \"Comments\" field of the bill, without special syntax as it is for human use only (namely for an auditor to quickly find the originals of the signed timesheets, which are in SignRequest or on paper but _not_ the copies in FreeAgent as these have no auditable log). Use links as found in the SignRequest \"[My documents](https://signrequest.com/#/documents)\" list where applicable. Example:\n\n    ```plaintext\n    Signed time records:\n    2019-05: https://signrequest.com/#/document-status/81a66af3-a9dd-4c8e-9619-80c1b1be5a17\n    2019-06: https://signrequest.com/#/document-status/81a66af3-a9dd-4c8e-9619-80c1bcd4629b\n    2019-07: on paper, archived by Edgeryders\n    ```\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-2\">4.2. Entering your expense claims</h3>\n\n1. **Register your expense claim** by following [our usual process for expense reimbursements](/t/9078).\n\n2. **Fill in the work package number** into the \"Description\" field of the expense record, using the format from this example: `work_package=wp1`.\n\n3. **Fill in the Entry date** into the \"Description\"** field of the expense record. FreeAgent does not record at what date an expense record was created in FreeAgent, but that is important to determine in which reporting period the record has to be included. So enter it manually in the format from this example: `entry_date=2018-11-02`.\n\n4. **If not travel: fill in the expense type.** If your expense record is for travel expenses, no need to do anything here as `h2020_costtype=travel` will be assumed as the default.\n\n    If your expense type is different, add the right  `h2020_costtype=\u2026` value from the [European Commission Reporting Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OQu7wLbOqZRJjC9U13IaPN-GLvIs09HV/view)'s official categories (p. 24):\n\n    [details=main categories]\n    These are the only categories that you'll have to care about:\n\n    * **`travel`.** Assumed by default if no `h2020_costtype` value is given. Travel costs, such as flights, accommodation, per diem allowances.\n\n    * **`equipment`.** Officially \"Other direct costs: Equipment\". Equipment purchases that are direct costs for the project.\n\n    * **`indirect`.** Indirect costs, which are costs not directly incurred as a result of the project. For example, accounting fees. They will not be included 1:1 for reimbursement by the European Commission, but as 25% of direct costs. So it is not necessary (and not possible) to mark all indirect costs across projects, but if there is an occasional indirect cost item accounted for in the Horizon 2020 project, mark it that way so we know what it is.\n\n    * **`non-eligible`.** Cost that we cannot get reimbursed by the European Commission, for example because it was not included in the original budget or reported too late. It may still be a business expense for Edgeryders O\u00dc, which is why we cannot determine the cost type simply from the FreeAgent expense category and need this whole mechanism in the first place.\n    [/details]\n\n    [details=auxiliary categories]\n    You will typically never encounter these categories in an Edgeryders H2020 project, but for completeness of the system, here they are:\n\n    * **`other-goods-services`.** Officially \"Other direct costs: Other goods and services\". Other costs that are eligible for reimbursement under Horizon 2020 rules.\n\n    * **`subcontract`.** Officially, \"Direct costs of subcontracting\". These are invoices for services _**except**_ where the work hours are being tracked inside FreeAgent. This cost type will be usually absent for us; consult with the project manager in Edgeryders O\u00dc if you think you need it.\n\n    * **`personnel`.** Officially \"Direct personnel costs\". Invoices for work hours that have already been tracked inside FreeAgent. As a result, these invoices will not be included in the financial reporting since the associated work hours are already included there at the time they are accrued.\n\n    * **`large-infrastructure`.** Officially \"Other direct costs: Costs of large research infrastructure.\" Will not be needed for our projects, but adding it here for completeness.\n\n    * **`financial-support`.** Officially, \"Direct costs of financial support\". Whatever that is, it will not be needed for our projects.\n    [/details]\n\nIf you make a mistake, no problem. Expense records can be edited at any time, even after the expense has been reimbursed already. The same applies to the \"Comment\" field of bills, even after the bill was paid (which locks most other fields).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-3\">4.3. Taking care of procurement requirements</h3>\n\nAs a team leader, make sure that you and your team members respect the following rules when buying services:\n\n![Capture|690x157](upload://dYAuQFiHgR5VvShxSdqxQ7P6PNW.png) \n\nSave the three written quotes in the dedicated folders on the Google Drive: for POPREBEL [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1SFy3j0ZK0u0C1wdYpeFmlEoIwrR04PeE) and for NGI Forward [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1Ksy2oMpj2uEmEErU9PvY6KrWnO-AybbU). Follow this file naming format:\n\n```\nOffer_[type of expense]_[date].[ext]\n```\n\nFor example,  `Offer_GraphicDesign_2019-10-23.pdf` . For the chosen one add  `SELECTED` , for example  `Offer_GraphicDesign_2019-10-23_SELECTED.pdf` .\n\nThe \"Sole Source\" rule can be applied in cases of paying for intellectual services (people with specific expertise such as speakers at conferences or workshop moderators), meaning that the person is the only supplier that can provide you with the goods or products you need). These rules do not apply to expenses reported as for company staff (including our contracting using time-based contracts that are deemed equivalent to staff).\n\nFor every service provider it is advised (but not obligatory) to sign a contract.\n\n**What is the difference between services and subcontractors?**\n\n* Contracts for a service do not cover the implementation of action tasks, but they are necessary to implement action tasks by beneficiaries. **These tasks are not described in Annex 1** (Workpackage description). It is someone who provides resources or services for the action.   \n\n- Subcontracts concern the implementation of action tasks; they imply the implementation of specific **tasks which are part of the action and are described in Annex 1**. It is someone working on the action. \n\nNote that in most of our Horizon2020 project, we do not have the budget for subcontracting. This means, the team leaders need to ensure that the cost is eligible (according to the above rules) when hiring service providers. \n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Filling the Financial Reporting Template</h2>\n\nThe instructions below document our custom, open source tool that helps to fill in the Horizon 2020 \"Regular Reporting Template\". This is a standard template required by the European Commission. The reporting periods vary, either 6 months or 12 months. (For POPREBEL, it is 12 months. An internal report is required at 6 months, but we argued to use blog posts for that.)\n\nThe reporting template is implemented in various ways by the project lead partners. Usually they implement it with a spreadsheet. This implementation can vary slightly, but the spreadsheet or our tool can be adapted easily.\n\n1. **Get the FreeAgent data export file.** This can be found in [our FreeAgent account](https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/) \"Edgeryders \u2192 Settings \u2192 My Company \u2192 Export All Data\". Save it to your computer.\n\n2. **Get the SignRequest signer export file.** This can be created in [SignRequest](https://signrequest.com/) in the \"[My Documents](https://signrequest.com/#/documents)\" section, by clicking <kbd>Export Signers</kbd>.\n\n3. **Run the financial reporting utility.** When the first reporting is due, we will have a small custom tool that can convert the above FreeAgent and SignRequest files to the format that is useful for filling the Financial Reporting Template.\n\n4. **Copy & paste the \"Personnel Costs\" spreadsheet.** Copy all values and paste them in the Financial Reporting Template into sheet \"Personnel Costs\", table \"Personnel\".\n\n5. **Copy & paste the \"Travel & Subsistence\" spreadsheet.** Copy all values and paste them in the Financial Reporting Template into sheet \"Travel & Subsistence\", starting in column \"B\" (\"Attendee(s)\"). Then fill in column A manually and sort the table at the end.\n\n6. **Copy & paste the remaining spreadsheets.** They go into spreadsheet \"Other costs & Subcontracts\" into the like-named tables \"Other costs\", \"Subcontracts\" and \"Direct costs of Financial Support\".\n\n7. **Fill in the remaining fields in spreadsheets \"Summary\" and \"Claim history\".** We might be able to automate some of that by improving the reporting template we received.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--6\">6. Project monitoring with FreeAgent</h2>\n\nWhen running long and complex projects, it is important to check periodically that we are neither under- nor overspending. Failure to do so might result in last-minute scrambles, lost revenue and organizational discomfort. When we track time with FreeAgent, we can use the FreeAgent export utility plus [pivot tables](https://youtu.be/Tty0RyD1KLw) to keep track of how much effort has gone into different tasks and different projects.  \n\n1. Navigate to the `Settings` page in FreeAgent. You will find it clicking on Edgeryders => Settings, or [here](https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/settings).\n1. Click on `Export all data`. After a while, Freeagent exports a `.xlsx` file. In what follows, we use Google Sheets as the editor, but you could use other software too, with minor modifications.\n1. Navigate to Google Sheets and import your exported file (File => Import => Upload). The file imports flawlessly, creating a sheet with many tabs.\n1. Find the `Timeslips` tab, then click on Data => Pivot table.\n1. From the wizard on the right, click on `Row Add` and then select the `Task` variable. This lists your tasks as rows of the pivot table. Do this if you want a breakdown of time spent by task. With Horizon 2020 projects, the tasks correspond to Work Packages. We arrange the table like this because it is easier to visualize: there are, by definition, more tasks than projects. Deselect the `Show totals` box, we do not need it.\n1. Now click on `Column Add` and select the `Project` variable. This creates a colums per project.\n1. Click on `Values Add` and select `SUM`. \n1. Finally, use the `Filters` functionality to display only the projects you are interested in. The result looks like this:\n\n![image|690x260](upload://sGF0FA2rhqHr10CHRdQFpyZDNkq.jpeg) \n\nTotals are in hours, but they can be converted into PMs very easily:\n\n`PMs = (hours x 12) / 1720` \n\n**Take care: you still have to manually add the hours of the Edgeryders staff members that use tools other than FreeAgent to track their time.**.\n\nWith the same logic, you can build a report with money spent by category. To do it, start with the `Bills` tab, repeat the process above, but when adding rows in step 5 select `Category name`. \n\n![image|690x297](upload://plGL31HZQIvrATDIa5yICxa1czu.jpeg) \n\nFinally,  repeat one third time starting from the `Expenses`  tab. This keeps track of travel costs fronted by collaborators, that then Edgeryders reimbursed. In step 5, select `Type`. Because of double-entry accounting, these expenses show negative values. In the total sum by column, I have added a final row that _subtracts_ the total from the `Expenses` tab from the total from the `Bills` tab, instead of summing it, so that I know how much money we spent on these projects to date. \n\n![image|690x484](upload://4nxz7xOmT2lf3WPD5DFw0ih0BDg.jpeg)\n\n> :bulb: **If you came here to know the process, you can stop reading.** Everything below is just the discussion that made this process.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--7\">7. Design rationale</h2>\n\n* **FreeAgent as data source, as much as possible.** FreeAgent is our authoritative data source for financial data, so they need to make it from there into the official reporting spreadsheets somehow. Because of that it makes sense to store _all_ data that needs to go into the reporting spreadsheets in FreeAgent, if possible.\n\n    Data for various single-value fields in the reporting template cannot be stored in FreeAgent of course, but automating form-filling for this makes no sense anyway.\n\n* **Signature service for time records.** We cannot store the signed time records inside FreeAgent (even though FreeAgent can store timetracking data) because it does not have the required \"auditable log\" and \"use of electronic signatures\". Any admin can edit any time record there without leaving a trace.\n\n    However, as only monthly work hours per work package need to be reported, there is no need for a time tracker with auditable log, either \u2013 and such a thing does not even exist as open source software yet ([see below](/t/id/9143/33)). This makes a web-based signature service the most convenient solution. After looking through a lot of options, [SignRequest](https://signrequest.com/) is a great one, both very affordable and good quality. We only need one account at 8 EUR/month.\n\n* **Using SignRequest templates and attachments.** SignRequest was originally chosen because it offers templates, which simplify the Edgeryders side of the process and also allow us to automate the reporting with data exported from SignRequest.\n\n    In addition, we use the SignRequest feature to require [attachments](https://help.signrequest.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003506005) to allow us using templates even though part of the final document are some custom pages exported from a time tracker. These attachments cannot be deleted from a signed document and the audit log lists which attachments a user uploaded before signing. So together with a checkbox where the user confirms that the data in the attachments is correct, this should meet the formal requirements for time records (esp. given that such detailed time tracking data is not required at all).\n\n* **Choosing \"Only others\" as signers in SignRequest.** We do this because this way, we need not bother with giving SignRequest login \ncredentials to all \"supervisors\". Also, SignRequest identifies signers by e-mail address, so this would be compromised if all \"supervisors\" would sign using the same SignRequest account.\n\n* **Not combining multiple documents into a sign request.** SignRequest allows sending multiple documents to the same signatories in a single request, but that should better not be used as then the links we will post to FreeAgent later would then not identify one document properly.\n\n* **Not using date fields in SignRequest.** SignRequest provides a specialized field type for dates. These are always pre-filled though, either in the document without being able to change it or as a suggestion. And this pre-filling uses a useless US American date format by default while we want people to use the international [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date format, also to allow proper date parsing by our custom reporting tool after exporting the form data from SignRequest.\n\n* **Future improvement option: bulk sign requests.** Currently, the SignRequest [bulk sign requests](https://help.signrequest.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003292165) only support one remote signer. But their spreadsheet mechanism for pre-filling the data of such requests is already prepared to allow multiple remote signers. Once that is implemented, the Edgeryders admin action is just a single bulk sign request per month, also allowing to pre-fill name and month in these forms.\n\n* **Links from FreeAgent to SignRequest.** This is a consequence of using FreeAgent as the sole data source. To find the signed time records of a collaborator for a time period, the simplest way is then to find the corresponding invoice in FreeAgent and follow the links to SignRequest there. SignRequest itself is not suitable for searching stuff, as there are no folders, no search by document ID, no list of all signatories in the overview, no way to add a document description or to just change the filename.\n\n* **Process for people with non-FreeAgent time trackers.** Since the signed documents have to be archived by Edgeryders, the signing process has to be initiated by Edgeryders because that is the only way to archive a document of which one is not a signatory. And while there is an option for a signer to [upload an required attachment](https://help.signrequest.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003506005) before signing, it is not suitable because then the actually signed form could only say (if we want to avoid redundancy): \"I confirm that the attached time record is correct.\" That's not a proper form where the signature is at the bottom though, so might create issues during an audit as it is not too clear if and how an attachment can be changed after signing. So obtaining the time records as PDF and then initiating the signing from the Edgeryders account is, given that we do no longer use the templates feature in SignRequest, the only (and labor-intensive) option now.\n\n* **A custom reporting utility.** In the proposal above, we use one custom-developed tool that helps us fill the financial reporting template. It takes invoice, expense and time slip data from our FreeAgent accounting software and converts it to tables that can then be copy & pasted to the Financial Reporting Template. A custom tool makes sense here, as there are many records, so automating their conversion saves worktime and avoids mistakes.\n\n* **Reporting utility architecture.** We will have a small custom tool that can convert FreeAgent data and signed time records to the format that is useful for filling the Financial Reporting Template. Not sure yet how this will be implemented, but the following seems a flexible and fast to implement proposal (avoiding having to work with the FreeAgent and SignRequest APIs):\n\n    The tool will be a Python command line tool on your local computer. With respect to privacy and potential security holes, this is best. You call it with the FreeAgent export file and the SignRequest form data export file as parameters.\n\n    For better usability (\"no install\"), we may also create a small web utility on our server, based on Python Flask. It would simply present a simple form to upload the files and, call the command line utility in the background, and offer the converted file for download as a LibreOffice spreadsheet.\n\n* **No custom tools for other forms.** There are also other reporting forms, but we do not collect the data to enter there in any structured form. Also, these other forms nearly exclusively look for individual values, not lists of records, and thus there is no way to make this part of the reporting more efficient. We could only provide a form that looks different and does the same, filling in the other form, which is a waste of programming capacity.\n\n* **Only use unbillable tasks in FreeAgent.** For users who use FreeAgent for their H2020 time tracking needs, all FreeAgent tasks should be set to \"unbillable\" to not show show up as \"not billed yet\" in FreeAgent project statistics ([see](https://community.freeagent.com/freeagent/topics/how_to_make_a_timeslip_paid_without_creating_an_invoice)). Showing up as \"not billed yet\" would be inadequate because it implies we _should_ invoice European Commission for these hours \u2013 while we only have to report them to European Commission, but not invoice for them.\n\n* **Only use zero rated time in FreeAgent.** For all H2020 related tasks in FreeAgent that we use for time tracking, we set a rate of 0.00 EUR/hour. This way, the \"Include unbillable time\" option, enabled by default on the a project's overview page in FreeAgent, will not alter our project profit statistics. If we'd want to use that option as intended (so that it offers useful results on the project overview page), we'd have to set up different tasks per work package because people get paid different rates per hour. That creates more overhead, which seems unjustified. There would be no other use for these hourly rates: they are not used to invoice the client (since it's a grant, not paid by the hour) and there is no FreeAgent feature that would use them to sum up how much a collaborator can invoice Edgeryders for \u2013 no monetary values are included in the \"Work \u2192 Time Tracking \u2192 Create Report\" reports.\n\n* **Tracking time by project and work package.** While the official [timesheet template](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/legal/templ/tmpl_time-records_en.odt) does not require splitting tracked time by work package, the [European Commission's reporting template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OQu7wLbOqZRJjC9U13IaPN-GLvIs09HV/view) requires this:\n\n    > When direct personnel costs are reported in the financial statement, a pop-up window will appear in the IT tool requesting to give information of the amount on person months per WP.\n\n    Likewise, the reporting templates received by the consortium leaders require this information as well.", "created_at": "2018-11-03 16:49:06.588117", "updated_at": "2020-06-04 13:11:50.308316", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6694, "wiki": true, "reads": 39, "score": 3519.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76385, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 13448, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Also ping @Mar_ta if you have suggestions.\nAnd welcome to Edgeryders!", "created_at": "2020-05-12 12:54:51.613627", "updated_at": "2020-05-12 12:54:51.613627", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 8.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [76035], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58498, "user_id": 5238, "topic_id": 10626, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Thanks @MariaEuler Feel free to spread the word in the events section of NGI Community https://spaces.fundingbox.com/c/ngi-next-generation-internet/collections/events", "created_at": "2019-08-28 06:21:09.165501", "updated_at": "2019-08-28 06:21:09.165501", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 27.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58466], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62916, "user_id": 5539, "topic_id": 11337, "post_number": 9, "raw": "[quote=\"Sohayeb, post:3, topic:11337\"]\no see you on board my friend, and excited to see you join the \u201cHack 4 Environment\u201d Movement during the Edgeryders Festival\n[/quote]\n\nThank you @Sohayeb , and im thankful for such an opportunity.", "created_at": "2019-11-04 11:36:15.348369", "updated_at": "2019-11-04 11:36:15.348369", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 39, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 8.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [62864], "is_reply_to": [62864], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66267, "user_id": 5083, "topic_id": 9881, "post_number": 122, "raw": "And thank you @erik_lonroth, as well as all other contributors! :hearts: I failed to anticipate it, but I'd really want some chat room to continue our conversation.

And this time, concrete impacts are felt not in a handful of countries, but across the EU. \n\nEurope will not follow the US's example I hope, but still, there is a lack of scrutiny of decision-making, and the incentives of policymakers are not always aligned with the general interest. The coming year we'll see some huge decisions (new EU budget, 1.5 trillion recovery fund, legislation AI + online platforms), people should really be on top of this.

Community calls like \u201cHow to cope with loss of work\u201d and conversation threads like \u201cThis made me think..\u201d)\n2. **\u201cConnection\u201d**: Connecting people and projects to empower the creators to realise their projects and avoid the waste of resources. This also includes help with finding and applying to funding or creating crowdfunding campaigns.\n3. **\u201cLearning\u201d**: Looking back at reactions to previous crissi and learning from the current crisis and people's responses for future developments.\n\n# Proposals for next steps:\n\n**Create meaningful webinars/conversation rounds to address points 1-3.**\n\n### ABOUT The Webinars:\n\n* Here people can propose webinars: [Webinar & Community Call Schedule: Proposals/Wishlist](https://edgeryders.eu/t/webinar-community-call-schedule-proposals-wishlist/13044/4)\n* We have our own self-hosted video rooms (now.edgeryders)\n* We can do webinars that have restricted chat access:\n* Two levels of participation: Some people can just listen in, who have been there before can join into the conversation.\n* One version: Prefilm webinar and have the person who did the webinar aktive in the chat to directly answer questions\n* Crowdfunding: for conversations you get your question featured in the chat\n* Signup Forms: https://register.edgeryders.eu/ helps info, call quality, consent and follow up\n* Webkit: We can quickly put together minisites around specific themes that pick up content from the platform by taggs. Example: https://work.edgeryders.eu/\n\n#### Our resources:\n\n* We can set up such a minisite around topics like for a recurring webinar\n* Community management\n* Outreach\n\n## Concrete ACTION POINT from the call:\n\nMaking one call for *mapmakers*. Align mapping initiatives before we double the learning and efforts in mapping as well.\n**Ask and answer:** *Who is doing mapping attempts? How are they doing it? What is working well - what is not working well?*\n\n## We want to set up a call focusing on mapping in 3 weeks time:\n\n# Proposed date: 04/05/2020 MAY the 4TH be with you: Mapping our way through the universe\n\n# *Please comment below with projects and speakers we should connect to for this or your examples of good or bad coordination!*\n\n## What else is being developed:\n\nAn app that connects apps like telegram and WhatsApp with an edgeryders chatbot that creates an account and posts for you on the platform. This way people can easily forward good posts. But it is still experimental.\n\n## Context for the proposed actions:\n\nMassimo and Liliana as well as many community and team members kept stressing the issue of parallel developments and a lack of coordination.\n\nMassimo described a very concrete example where he had had a call with @mstn and another developer to discuss potential collaboration as their developments were similar. Massimo started being interested and available to help to conduct interviews and start the development of a process and/or tool for coordinating projects.\n\nLiliana added that she also sees many local efforts not being properly connected and that she sees the main need in some type of mapping for projects. She invited Massimo to join the telegram of @RobvanKranenburg  Disposable Identity projects as she sees the conversations and interviews already happening there as good case studies.\n\n### The findings of the conversation:\n\n* The problems: The other developers do not want to collaborate further and data regulations also complicates the next step and them sharing their data.\n* There are two approaches: developing something that works as fast as possible and is open and dealing directly with the proper data restrictions was difficult, so people worked with systems of potentially questionable data.\n* Conducting and analysing interviews and case studies are necessary.\n\n## We need everyone\u2019s inputs into what is going on, what initiatives people are already working on - and how we can support efforts to cope with the COVID29 crisis.\n\nLet\u2019s map this clusterfu* together!\n\n### What do you think about the above?

About\n\nEdgeryders is involved in research activities, and our most distinctive tool is a method called semantic social networks, or SSNs (described in [this paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02478720/document)). *Note: this link to be updated when Field Methods publishes our paper*. This manual describes the recommended process to document, share and long-term store data produced in the course of an SSNA project. It also explains the rationale behind this process.\n\n## 2. Principles\n\nWe are committed to doing science in an ethical, responsible way. This means: \n\n* **Be generous**. Results, methods, collected and generated data etc. should be shared with everyone, with as much openness as we can get away with. \n* **Be accountable**. Our processes should be visible, our results replicable. \n* **Be mindful of humans**, their integrity and privacy. This means paying very close attention to data protection, privacy, and informed consent to research. \n\nAll this has implication for how we handle data. \n\n## 3. Data management standards\n\nWe adopt the following standards for SSN data:\n\n* License: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) (CC BY 4.0). \n* Data format: CSV, an open format which is the de facto standard for much data science at the time of writing this manual.\n* Data documentation: [Data Package](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/), a standard developed by the Open Knowledge Fundation and based on the [frictionless data](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/) approach.\n* Long-term storage: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), a facility maintained by CERN (and therefore expected to last a long time) and fully integrated with [OpenAire](https://www.openaire.eu), the European Union's initiative for open science.\n\n## 4. Pseudonymization: why and how\n\nIt is Edgeryders policy that SSN data should be pseudonymized. *Not* anonymized, because SSN analysis requires that all content by a participant is attributed to that user in order to preserve information about the social dynamics of the conversational environment. \n\nPseudonymization might seem pointless, because: \n\n1. SSNA is based on the online discussion on an open forum. If you have access to the full text of a post from a pseudonymized dataset, you can easily know the Edgeryders username of its author: just copy-paste the text into a web search engine. \n2. Edgeryders does not enforce a real name policy, so usernames are already pseudonyms. \n3. Everyone participating in Edgeryders research has given consent to their data being used for research.\n\nNevertheless, we believe pseudonymization takes care of a specific data protection problem, that arises when a participant, after the research project is over, decides to erase some of her posts, or to delete her Edgeryders account altogether. We have a procedure to deal with this, and indeed that participant's content will disappear from the edgeryders.eu database. But these changes will not affect research datasets, which are snapshots of parts of that database taken at a time when her content was still there. Even if we could commit to keeping past datasets stored on Zenodo in sync with the live database of edgeryders.eu (and we cannot credibly promise that), we have no way to even know if those datasets have been downloaded by other researchers in the mean time. Storing datasets in pseudonymized form allows a participant to \"disappear\" from the live DB of edgeryders.eu without affecting the integrity of the past dataset.\n\nEdgeryders is aware that pseudonymization, and even anonymization techniques rarely offer total protection in the modern world, and that de-anonymization is often possible. We have policies to discourage anyone in sharing on Edgeryders any content that requires strong protection.\n\n## 5. Export a SSN dataset\n\n### 5.1. Prepare the data\n\nMake sure that the online conversation related to your project is all appropriately tagged. While most research projects in Edgeryders have a category as their home, being in the right category is neither necessary nor sufficient for a topic to be included in the SSN. Instead, each topic should be tagged with a Discourse tag identifying the research project. This is how our ethnographic coding software, OpenEthnographer, identifies the topics to be coded by researchers. The naming convention for such tags is `ethno-PROJECTNAME`. \n\n### 5.2. Export and pseudonymize \n\n1. Download the scripts in [this repository](https://github.com/edgeryders/export-ssna-data). You will also need our Python module for API access (available [here](https://github.com/albertocottica/discourse-social-networks/blob/master/code/python%20scripts/z_discourse_API_functions.py)). Finally, you are going to need an API key to edgeryders.eu. If you do not have one, ask @matthias.\n\n2. Run the  `download_and_pseudonymize.py`script, replacing the Discourse tag for your project as the argument of the function called in the `__main__`. The script accesses live data on edgeryders.eu and saves them in the form of four files:\n\n    * `annotations.csv`. The ethnographic annotations from the project.\n    * `codes.csv`. The ethnographic codes from the project.\n    * `participants.csv`. A pseudonymized list of participants to the project's conversation.\n    * `posts.csv`.  All posts in the project's conversation, where the IDs for author/recipient and the text of each posts have been pseudonymized. For example, a mention like @alberto in the text of a post becomes `@anon12345678`. \n\n## 6. Document the dataset with Data Package\n\nThere are several ways to produce the datapackage.json file to accompany the CSV files. \n\n* Create it manually, with a text editor. This process is much faster if you start from our [example file](https://github.com/edgeryders/export-ssna-data/tree/master/example%20datapackage.json). \n* Infer it from your data. To this purpose, the Frictionless Data project provides [software libraries](https://frictionlessdata.io/software/) for several languages and frameworks. You still have to write the descriptions of files and fields in each file, or re-use and adapt the example file.\n* Upload your CSV files as a [Data.World](https://data.world) dataset ([example](https://data.world/haiku66/poprebel-ssn-data)). Data.World provides a very usable interface to add description to whole files and each individual column in each file. Upon downloading the dataset, Data.World generates automatically the datapackage.json. \n\nIf you follow this last method, be aware that Data.World has some quirks in how it represents tabular datasets. It creates two folders:\n\n* An `original` folder with the files you uploaded.\n* A `data` folder with the same files.\n\nThe `datapackage.json` documents all of these resources, i.e. 8 files. To get rid of this problem, the `trim_datapackage.py` script produces a streamlined version of the `datapackage.json`. The full dataset to be uploaded consists of only the original files, plus the streamlined `datapackage.json`.\n\n## 7. Store the dataset on Zenodo\n\n[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) has an intuitive user interface. If your project is funded by the EU, choose \"European Commission Funded Research (OpenAire)\" in the field called \"communities\". This opens another field to enter the project's acronym or number. It is important to do this, as it helps project officers and evaluators.\n\n:warning: At the time of writing, Zenodo has a long-standing issue preventing the seamless upload of JSON files.

I'm also reminded of how many of us are also seeing that the opportunities we must take are also at a local scale. For example, the Local Futures' documentary from several years ago called \"Economics of Happiness\" which maps the impacts of globalisation and shows how local economies can be a way for people to reclaim their agency, wellbeing and happiness (yes, happiness!) in feasible and collaborative ways. Part of my vision that aligns with some of our colleagues here at Edgeryders is that of the power of networking local responses to mobilise large scale change - eg. OpenVillage. And of course, there's the micro-democracy of @malka's book \"Infomacracy\" that is a radical and inspiring offering at this globalised edge you speak of.\n[/quote]\n\nAbsolutely, looking for solutions needs to occur on a local scale as well on the global scale. Living in a country with the EU (for now) that has done the most to undermine the localism agenda and reinforce the national centralisation of power perhaps i feel particularly clearly that the problem lies in this centralised 'levers of control' system.\nIf i've learned anything from 3 years of reading and contributing the Edgeryders platform it's that small scale solutions at the local level have the ability to make significant change to the people, and to leverage change at wider scales as well.\nI've found the balance between globalised and hyper-local that is involved in @Malka's Centenal cycle novels to be very inspirational.  It's an attractive notion that each voting block can liberate itself from historical national ties and chose the ideology and political freedom that most suits it. Of course it raise a whole heap of questions in my mind around how migration works in those systems, as well as how the trade system would work in that world. That said i have also been reading Prisoners of Geography on my travels recently, which gives a whole other lens to look at global **geo**-politics. It certainly helps to show the complex interplay that occurs between the physical environment which we actually have to inhabit and how that has an impact on regional and national psyches.\n\n[quote=\"anique.yael, post:5, topic:9193\"]\nA technique I use sometimes via my colleagues Andrew Murphie and Brian Massumi is conceptual speed dating.\n[/quote]\n\nSounds fascinating and definitely ties into the Micro fictions tool that i'm growing.

Thus:\n \nHello, I am Jean Russell. I am the author of several books: *[Thrivability: Breaking Through to a World that Works](https://www.triarchypress.net/thrivability.html)* and *[Cultivating Flows: How Ideas become Thriving Organizations](https://www.triarchypress.net/cultivating-flows.html)* (with Herman Wagter). I also have some articles and other people mention my work. I can supply a list if you want. \n\nFor the last couple of years, I have been working on **[Holochain](https://holochain.org/)** (including project lead for our fully successful ICO of [Holo](https://holo.host/)). Currently I co-direct a sister organization, **[Commons Engine](https://commonsengine.org/)**, where we hope to make it easier and faster (supported by tech) to create commons-centric economies with better governance around data commoning. We also teach a \"currency design\" class that I would call \"incentives and gamification of markets\" more than currency design (as financialization).\n\nI find the world needs so much inspiration and education to understand what we are doing. I am curious how storytelling and implementation can play together. I think it is deeply transformational to pull these things together for mutual uplift. \n\nI don't know what I want to work on. \n\n* I have considered writing another book, this time about the business models that can replace surveillance capitalism and make the decentralized web viable while transitioning us to a more commons-centric economy. \n* I am interested in commons governance (and the use of money as a last resort rather than first suggestion).\n* I wonder if Demurrage could play a role in decoupling us from the growth imperative. \n\nOh, and my publisher is interested in what we are doing with the lab.\n\nI am curious. I might abandon the explicit avenue and write scifi that inspires a vision of the above! \n\nAnd yes. On impulse I decided to fly over for the event! \n\nI think it is important.", "created_at": "2019-11-08 19:49:39.037874", "updated_at": "2019-11-08 19:49:39.037874", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 328, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 77.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5, 5528], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55534, "user_id": 5025, "topic_id": 10045, "post_number": 19, "raw": "[quote=\"hugi, post:18, topic:10045\"]\nYou could demo the Blivande forum?\n[/quote]\n\nTotally", "created_at": "2019-06-21 07:29:13.640053", "updated_at": "2019-06-21 07:29:13.640053", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [55531], "is_reply_to": [55531], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37639, "user_id": 4056, "topic_id": 7263, "post_number": 14, "raw": "[text-direction=rtl]\n\n   \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0645\u0628\u0646\u0627 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644 \u0648\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0645\u0645\u064a\u0632 \u0648\u064a\u062d\u062a\u0648\u064a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062d\u062f\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627  \n\n \u0633\u0646\u062c\u0639\u0644 \u0645\u0646\u0647 \u062c\u0632\u0623 \u0641\u0646\u062f\u0642  \u0644\u0644\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062c\u0627\u0646\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \n\n\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0627\u0643\u0646 \u0634\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0633\u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0631\n[/text-direction]", "created_at": "2017-10-05 18:14:05.168849", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 18:30:52.620399", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 8.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [37627], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72446, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 12970, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-03-25 12:52:51.608889", "updated_at": "2020-03-25 12:52:51.608889", "deleted_at": "2020-03-29 12:55:52.913363", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66259, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 9881, "post_number": 120, "raw": "![IMG_20191128_132159|517x690](upload://kTtuxbWz1OwuU76XykSDoUlo5Zq.jpeg) ![IMG_20191128_150421|690x517](upload://lIZdPyr5TZfpT5goMXuHmfCvvdY.jpeg)\n![IMG_20191128_111003|690x517](upload://h0bF31SBKkvPIo4IrQaQxnBDXQb.jpeg)", "created_at": "2019-11-28 18:51:28.895205", "updated_at": "2019-11-28 18:51:57.257731", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 88.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5025, 5083, 4022, 5661, 5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53731, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9821, "post_number": 60, "raw": "I think with China the government controls everyone already - what they can and can't see, say or do.

Still does that a lot of the time.\n\nas for sponsored content, in news there has always been what was called a \"church-state separation.\"  Anyone reading a newspaper could immediately tell what was an ad of course, but other sponsored content had to be printed in a font clearly different from the regular news font, plus it would always say something like \"special sponsored section.\"  A paper will still do that, but the websites often do not. And that is exactly what a sponsor wants.  They do not see their job as upholding the integrity of news. Their job is to sell products and however they get there is fair game.

It is always true, for some value of \"people\". But we are edgeryders: we do embrace the power of collaboration, and are ready to invest in it. At the same time, we accept that not everyone is an edgeryder: anyone can join us, but not everyone will. If people are not motivated enough to sit down and write, well, that's it then. We probably could never shoulder the cost of communicating with them anyway, so it is unlikely that we could ever do much together.\n\nAll that said, I am prepared to cut a lot of slack to people involved in disaster relief. Now it is not the time to be demanding that people sit down and write careful blog posts.\n\nHowever, I am\u00a0<em>very</em>\u00a0reluctant to agree to video. Here's why: if we have to transcribe stuff, the costs of ethnography go right back up to what they were before online ethno kicked in. You risk using the effort of the engagement managers to acquire video, that then <a href=\"/u/meenabhatta\">@meenabhatta</a>\u00a0cannot code unless someone spends\u00a0<em>many\u00a0</em>hours transcribing them. We have no budget for that kind of stunt.\u00a0\n\nSo. In \"the other \\#futuremakers\" (Armenia, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Morocco, Ukraine) we will be asking engagement managers to (1) ideally get people involved in great projects at the edge to post about them themselves; (2) if that does not work, to act as journalists, do an interview with them and post the results. This is not so far from what happened in the <a href=\"/t/lote4-stewardship-case-studies/418\">LOTE4 Stewardship Case Studies</a>: people like <a href=\"/u/lauren\">@Lauren</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/mariabyck\">@mariabyck</a>\u00a0\u2013 and also more occasional contributors like <a href=\"/u/elami5\">@ElaMi5</a>\u00a0\u2013 acted as \"community journalists\", reporting in writing on other people's projects. These reports (except Maria's, upon her request) were then coded into the ethnographic report.\u00a0\n\nWould this work for you? You can still do video as a way to engage people, just make it clear they won't be transcribed. If someone has something to say, they have to write. Writing in Nepali \u2013 or sending emails \u2013 is ok.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-18 12:28:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:27.486401", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 418, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5, 2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37336, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 7237, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Sure, I attended:\n\n* **BioFabbing convergence in Ideasquare at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.** May 10-11, 2017\nI was an invited speaker at this event.\n* **Biohackathon at Waag Society, Amsterdam, Netherlands.** July 7-9, 2017\n* **Workshop Mycotecture 101 at Counter Culture Labs, Oakland, US.** September 17th, 2017\nI was the facilitator of this event.\n* **Global Community Bio Summit at MIT Media Lab, Boston, US.** September 21-24, 2017\nI pitched OpenCare at this event.\n\nAnd then of course OpenVillage!", "created_at": "2017-10-02 15:34:48.448255", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 15:34:48.448255", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 77, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 47.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [37330], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59143, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 10691, "post_number": 24, "raw": "Ah!

My PhD thesis is about internet memes - phenomenon that changed the way of online communication. I explore it from cultural and social perspective.\n\nOne of the things that's bothering me is the question of fake news - which is connected with memes. It's terrifying and fascinating at the same time, that people are so willing to spread anything they see, without verification. Sometimes it's just funny stuff, but memes can be used, for example, as a tool of online propaganda (even NATO have some publications about it). One of my goals is to find a way (mainly by educating users, but maybe also some online tool) to prevent this phenomenon without establishing online censorship.\n\nVery important questions in Internet nowadays are safety and privacy. In my personal opinion concentration of power and knowledge about users' preferences in hands of few companies (we all know, which ones) is very dangerous and we are not very far from visions showed in \"Black Mirror\". Internet was thought as decentralized space and should envelope in this way. Today, if you want to be *really* safe online, you shouldn't have account on any social media (or have fake ones), use VPN and have dedicated hardware just to do online payments. I find it slightly paranoid.\n\nI' m familiar with scientific literature (e.g. Limor Shifman, Paul Levinson, Lev Manovich), but I'm also practician: I worked as an editor in few websites, I also taught students about online journalism.\n\nI'm interested in operating systems (currently exploring different Linux distributions) and IOT.\n\nAs former academic teacher I'm good at managing communities (also online).\n\nI also have many friends among found scientists interested in digital media, digital culture, online discourses, etc.\n\nMy CV is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uCzvs7afXpQCsop5F-tT1iTgNCjwTiJm/view?usp=sharing).\n\nAlso, I would like to ask, is the exact date of April training already known?

The most successful and powerful European state, Germany, sees its own success and power stemming directly from conservative spending, working hard and saving for a rainy day. When they insist other European countries bite the austeritarian bullet, they point to their own efforts to raise labor productivity in the 1990s. \"It worked for us. Just do it, it's good for you.\"\n\nEuropean Commission officials may privately disagree with the official line \u2013 I know at least some that do. But they are public servants, and they see their role as furthering the political goals set by their political leaders, not as challenging them. If we are to work together, we have to identify a space of action in which we are aligned, a part of the way we can all walk even though we are ultimately not going to the same place.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-05 16:51:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:21.167036", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 291, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25453], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71591, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 12861, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Ok, noted.

He has focused his entire study and work career on the social economy sector, where he has worked since 2009. He has been project manager at the Presidency Office of FEBEA (European Federation of Ethical and Alternative Banks and Financial Companies), in SEFEA (financial cooperative, tool of FEBEA) and SEFEA IMPACT (asset management company dedicated to impact investing strategies). He has supported these organisations in their political and operational relations with the various EU institutions, taking part to numerous negotiations, meetings and events (engaging mainly the EU Commission, EIF, EESC). He has developed a deep knowledge of the social economy and social finance context throughout Europe, being directly engaged also in the screening and execution of investment operations throughout Europe in such sectors. He joined FdCM in early 2020 as Project Manager.\n\n#### Dr. Alberto Cottica, Edgeryders\n\nAlberto is an expert on collaborative governance and participation.  He studies participation through data analysis. That led him to build up substantial skills as a data scientist, and in particular a network scientist, both in business and in academia. He has a proven track record of managing processes of ICT-enabled design and delivery of public policy and public services in collaboration with citizens.\n\nAlberto has firsthand experience in establishing, nurturing and running communities of citizens that work towards common goals, sometimes in alliance with government. He also has a proven track record of driving adoption of innovative practices - and of a practice of openness and transparency in policy delivery \u2013 in fairly conservative large organisations, including government agencies. To achieve this, I had to hone my advocacy skills, and use them successfully to build positive narratives that change is possible, and we need not be scared of it.\n\nAlberto hails from an economics background, but these days thinks more in terms of network science, data science and complexity theory than of textbook economics. Pervasive information and communication technologies, together with the societal changes they have been associated with, enable public policy and even public services to be collaboratively produced. Alberto has first hand experience in establishing, nurturing and running communities of citizens that work with government towards public goals. He is interested in complexity economics as a framework to think about these things. Alberto has authored a book on the wiki government, many journal articles and a long running blog. \n\n\n### The Agenda\n\n1.5 hr session:\n\n5 min: Nadia opens the event, describes the agenda and introduces the speakers and opens the floor for you to do short presentations. Maria goes over tech, chat questions.\n\n5 min: Giacomo talks about his personal professional experience that lead him to working with the Foundation in Messina.\n\n5 min: Alberto talks about historic developments in economic thinking and introduces the series. Hands over to Giacomo.\n\n30 min: Deeper conversation. Alberto prepares some questions to ask Giacomo the Messina Advanced Social District (which he will send in advance) and then the two of you talk with one another in \u201cfree form\u201d.\n\n5 min: Break\n\n15 min: Breakout session. Participants are split into small groups, each one has its own allocated zoom room and a host from the crew (ideally Alberto, and Giacomo would be in separate rooms. The groups are to discuss/answer two questions:\n\n* Where do you see areas where standard economic thinking is not cutting it?\n* Where do you see a role for out of the box economic thinking given that it is risky?\n\n25 min: Plenary, open floor moderated discussion. \n\n3 min: Nadia closes the session; thanks participants and says what is next (invites people to the next thing and says that we will follow up with each person individually to explore possibilities)\n\n### Who is coming?\n80  confirmed participants so far from a diverse range of disciplines and organisations including:\n\nEsri R&D Centre, New Delhi\nEconomists\nPrivacy International\nThe Scottish Government\nData and Training Consultants\nCommunity Manager & Officer Comms Social Innovation Projects\nConsultant - Strategy, Business, Environment, Energy, Sustainability at Researcher\nDirectors of employment centres\nRegional Innovation Centers at IGOs\nAfrican Research Center on Aging & Dementia (ARCAD)\nThe Democratic Society\nSenior Experts at European Commission\nAccelerator Lab Mali \nDigital Transformation Units in governments\nStatisticians\nMunicipalities\nSenior City Advisors, Climate-KIC\nHeads of Data Units at State e-Government Agencies\nProgram Directors and Senior Policy Officers at the European Commission\nRenewable energy experts\n+++", "created_at": "2020-09-07 06:57:24.161263", "updated_at": "2020-09-08 11:27:32.928181", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 826, "wiki": true, "reads": 27, "score": 125.4, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [428, 4, 3, 6658, 6679, 6677], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16387, "user_id": 1629, "topic_id": 2316, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Viral Academy Website</b>\n\nSorry for the slow reply @Noemi - we've been heavily involved at unMonastery working on The Festival of Growing, and neglected posting and updating in this group until the relationship between the projects was sorted.

They fast tracked me into the session, even though the application window had closed weeks before.\n\nThe satellite version of these meeting is a much smaller cohort of members, and in this instance probably had a disproportionate number of 'local' artists and performance makers. Partly due to the location in Wales (which is often under served by international arts meetings) and also because of the theme of the conference: [Fields of Vision - Other voices, rural places, global stories.](https://www.ietm.org/en/satellite-llandudno-2018) \nWales is probably one of the most rural regions in Northern Europe, with only 6 cities (3 within 40mins drive each other on the southern coast, 1 on the mid west coast and 2 in the north - the smallest city St Davids has a population of only 1.800 people!) This says more about the crazy way that cities are designated in the UK than anything else.\nThe whole group of us filled a coach on one day as we were taken through the Snowdonia National Park to nearby University town of Bangor where a large multi discipline arts venue has recently opened, funded by the University and public/private investment money.\n\nThe focus of the event was around case studies and discussions led by artists and cultural managers with direct experience of working in rural settings. There was a lot of talk about site-specific practice, working outside of the confines of traditional theatre environments. The modern artist must work to inspire people, wherever they are, not just by bringing them to cultural centres. \nThis idea resonated deeply with me as i thought about the Edgeryders displaced connections that grow through digital platforms. Over the next few years there will be a drive from cultural organisations across the globe to finally understand the place for the digital realm in the live arts field. Trying to be out there ahead of that curve is a benefit, but there will be a lot of experiments and a lot of failures before anyone finds the real synergy between these 2 platforms (online/live)\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f6e069ec768d669da24b22af0376efb3646ec098.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\">\nWe heard a lot from an artist and cultural manager called Henk Keizer from Culture Forum Denmark (former board member of IETM and part of the Leeuwerden 2018 ECoC and Elefsis 2021 ECoC bid) His heart is obviously very much in the rural artistic practice and he suggested that the artists who want to connect with the bg issues of the world are largely working outside of the cities. He presented a number of case studies of projects that engaged with remote an rural communities, often looking at major issues around the future of communications, responses to tragedy in communities, the difficulties of farming and food. His view is very much that rural areas are now the front line for transformations of our societies, given that they are tied so intrinsically into our food/nature/ecosystems.\n\nThere was a clear idea that the objective of the arts in rural settings is not to bring 'culture' to the area, but instead to uncover and pay tribute to the culture that already exists in those place. People want to be seen and heard first and foremost, therefore the job of the artist in these settings is to be a journalist first. Being sincere is more substantial than being polite.\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/42d828b462ce4a19a5166c639b07feb6dfed4e0f.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\">\n\nThere was also the beginning of a discussion about cross-sectoral and cross-borders working throughout the EU as a way around the politics of national arts funding bodies and as a way towards a better Federated arts practice. Understanding the role of networks and communications between citizens in Europe to develop artistic responses to problems.\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/44d1dc23b3fd18590acd9d34d7746722eabf1f67.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\">\nWe also had a great case study presentation from Heba El Cheikh from [_Mahatat_](http://mahatatcollective.com/), based in Egypt. They produce community driven artistic responses to local issues moving between 3 smaller cities in Egypt. A lot of the work that she does reminded me immediately of @HadeerGhareeb work in Morocco with Toys from Trash. Heba mentioned that she is heading to Morocco in the next few months, so if Hadeer is still there then you should definitely meet up! I only got to speak to her for 15 mins right at the end of the conference, but i did pick up some copies of her Face to Face toolkits and her contact card<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/302206fda22c772bb435b502281e65a524ea849c.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"684\">\n\nI also met with Annie Roy from [ATSA](https://atsa.qc.ca/), a Quebecois performing arts company who specialise in work that is all about social changemeking, and who are very well established internationally. We're already talking with them about them pitching in with our Culture Squad application for the [RebelVillage](https://edgeryders.eu/t/rebelvillage-application-for-nordisk-kulturfund/8995/6) project in Stockholm 2019. \nAlongside this we talked about their next large scale project which is all about data and data science, and about how little people know about the data that is available on them. I mentioned that there would be a perfect fit into our community if she were looking for experts in that particular field.\nAs a result of these conversations i and @natalia_skoczylas are working out if we can go to Clermont Ferrand in 2 weeks time to see their art in action (paid for by the Cultural Attache for Quebec) This is a dry run for an ECoC bid for 2028 from Clermont Ferrand, so another chance for us to start a few conversations about Edgeryders ECoC work.\n\nOn the final day i met very briefly with Tunde Adefioye, who is a City Dramaturge based in Brussels. I have no idea what a City Dramaturge does, but it sounded wonderful and immediately i thought of @anique.yael, @matteo_uguzzoni and @noemi. Particularly around the Cities of Play project. If anyone who is in Brussels would like to meet up with him for coffee and find out more about what he does/see if there's more Edgeryders overlap then let me know. I will upload his contact details to our database.\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/253812c6c92b21ef0a0f9ba4732f617c9dd02409.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\">\nThe penultimate note is about structures and support mechanisms.\nFirstly, from a structural point of view it was very old fashioned. a lot of sitting in rows and listening to case studies. A lot of passive and not much active. Acknowledging that on a number of occasions i could sense there was an desire for something a bit more active and non-hierarchical. In the one session where we got to work together i took a leaf from @thomas_goorden at LOTE5 and i took the lead facilitator for the whole festival for a 20 minute walk through the woods to talk about artistic practices. It was the best part of the meeting. There is much that we could bring to the network.\nSecondly, something we could learn. Because the event was in Wales there were live translators available for all of the sessions. This allowed panel members and members of the audience to speak in Welsh (an official language of the country) and everyone present to still have English translation. This required a translator, headsets and short wave transmitter set up.\nCertainly something we could consider for some of our events going forwards, especially in Brussels, allowiing us to operate in Euro English, but to have French or similar translations for other participants. We may be able to access funding locally to integrate this into future large scale events. It would also be worthwhile thinking about having a permanent system like this in any future Reef spaces. Then only the translator would be needed for events. Perhaps one for @alberto and @mariacoenen when they are considering future spaces.  \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fb2c32fec5641e65d658ca25d84863bf59729c11.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\">\n\nFinally, there are 2 more IETM meetings before the end of the year. IETM Munich in early November and IETM Caravan Palestine in late November. I am in discussion to attend the Munich plenary with @natalia_skoczylas so we can have even more conversations. I expect there to be around 300 delegates at that session, so the more people on the ground for that session the wider a net we can spread. Additional delegates from Edgeryders will cost Euro50 each if we book before 12:00 CET Friday 28th Septmeber, or 100Euro after that. If there are a small group of us we can share an Airbnb in Munich. If anyone is interested let me know asap and i'll book it in.\n\nFor the Palestine Caravan i have an extra day to apply, but it is by application only. They are specifically looking for organisations that are interested in developing links in that region. Edgeryders fits becasue we are still looking at MENA activity and how we can grow our presence there. I wondered if @hazem, @HadeerGhareeb or @zmorda wanted to go along with their MENA development opportunities hats on?

Great that you have a different opinion.\n\n[details=\"Rant alert! continue at your own risk for a short version of my \"embittered economist\" rant\"]\n \nBit of personal history: I did my first degree (equivalent of today's bachelor + master) at Uni Modena. This had been founded with substantial trade union support in the late 1970s. It was staffed with (then young) professors that all came from Cambridge, and had studied with Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa. We were taught not just economics, but its history, as it grew out of moral philosophy in the 17th and 18th century; and not just neoclassical economics, but also the classics \u2013 Smith, Ricardo, Marx. We were taught that markets are just a tool, and marginalism just another value theory \u2013 one that had been refuted for good by Sraffa in the 1960s. \n\nWe were also told that, when that happened, the economics profession did something remarkable: with the honorable exception of Samuelson, they just ignored Sraffa's argument (the so-called \"Cambridge critique\") and continued to develop the neoclassical model. This would be the equivalent of 16th century astronomers breaking Galileo's telescope, shrugging, and sticking to the Ptolemaic system.\n\nSo, I cannot get excited about this argument:\n\n[quote=\"hires, post:4, topic:13173\"]\nit\u2019s not about which school is right, but we start with the purpose - humanity and the society we want to create\n[/quote]\n\nNot only because it is already in *The Wealth of Nations* (1780), though it is. But because it implies the rest of us are idiots. What am I supposed to say? \"Start with a fair society, *then* build the economics conducive to that! Why did no one think about this before?\" People *did* think about this, a great deal. Even I, as a teenage fledgling economist in the 1980s, did. \n\nWe have the economics we have because this model *does* give rise to the society that we want, where \"we\" is dominated by the powerful people. We have built our utopia: you are looking at it. You and I may not find it so utopian, but this is because we are on the losing side, and economics, like history, is written by the winners. \n\nSo, when someone comes to me and presents this as an intellectual problem... I have a hard time respecting it. It is not. It is a power problem. And since the framing is wrong, the line of action will be wrong: in this case, the idea is (I think, hope I am wrong) to make Raworth famous, so she can present at Davos, and all the great and good will go \"by golly, here's an idea! We had never thought about it. Let's do it!\". I don't think so :smiley: \n\nThe real question, which is why we have a Sci-Fi Economics Lab, is this: \n\nWhat kind of economic models that are conducive to a fair society are also autopoietic, i.e. they can bootstrap themselves from the bottom up? And of these, which ones can scale and take over before they are stomped out from the top (the *Walkaway* problem)? Because I no longer believe help will come from the great and good. But hey, hope I'm wrong. I am certainly a little jaded. \n\n[/details]", "created_at": "2020-04-10 17:52:53.450903", "updated_at": "2020-04-10 17:52:53.450903", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 553, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 48.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [74164], "is_reply_to": [74164], "is_liked_by": [428, 5268], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53170, "user_id": 5038, "topic_id": 9705, "post_number": 65, "raw": "I'm sorry to say it won't work out this time.

Example in question: I'm following <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cleanupversovarockbeach/\">a community in Mumbai</a> doing regular cleanups on a local beach. They pulled some 3000 metric tons of plastic garbage from the ocean, but obviously the city always provides more. So back in July, a friend from Mumbai was looking for ways to catch the garbage while it's carried in the river and before it reaches the shore, and together we found <a href=\"https://swachhbharat.mygov.in/activities/indigenously-designed-floating-barrier-rivers-and-streams-control-solid-waste\">this barrier boom</a> technology, produced locally in India by <a href=\"http://www.alphamers.com/innovation\">a company from Bangalore</a>. So the tech part is solved in principle (and the barrrier can even be installed in a way that lets boats pass.) But we are at a loss how to organize people to get this thing purchased (or DIY made) installed. After reading about your approach, it seems to me that an arts and documentary project could be the missing social catalyst in a case like this. Showing people the progress they have made already, and how a river barrier is the logical next step for a lasting solution. Well, or that people stop littering, but let's be realistic for the near term :)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-20 22:10:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:02.407016", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 279, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10627], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65847, "user_id": 5953, "topic_id": 11933, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Tell us about yourself?

In Romania, like in Poland and countries in the region, heck almost anywhere it seems, racism flourishes: http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/22/mapped-what-each-eu-country-impacted-by-new-quota-plan-thinks-about-refugees/\u00a0\n\nDunno what to say, the easiest is starting small I guess, have a portofolio/ inventory of projects like those that Jeff and Nadia are passionate about, and get them out when the time is right.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-13 16:52:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:48.608831", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 136, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19430], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68895, "user_id": 5667, "topic_id": 10552, "post_number": 18, "raw": "@alberto Thanks!

And to get to this level of simplicity took me and a lot of networks twenty years of fighting against the grain, and being misunderstood, as if we would be on the side of the Matrix, where in fact to us the potential for emancipation and a better balance between centralization and decentralization was on par with seeing animals, humans, machines and the planet itself as a caring and sustaining ecosystem. #IoT means transparency and exposing overhead and corruption. The balance I seek, was very well described by Malatezsta and Machno and can also be described as anarchocommunism (open on the services, closed on a public commons infrastructure). The current NGI 3step plan is exactly that. \n\nMy interest lies in building a stable political zone of human machine complimentarity, supporting humans in what they do best: ultimately Nietzsche's love and shame and for #IoT full resource management as our only chance against Climate Change. \n\nThis may be hard to grasp for people who are different than me, and most are. Most people have specific self interest. Mine is simply to be continue living in a stable society. That requires new political models and new political leadership.\nOne of the first public mentions to my plan to turn the passport into a device is 2011:\nhttps://robvankranenburgs.wordpress.com/2011/11/27/a-proactive-vision-on-a-full-internet-of-things-where-the-lights-are-on-all-is-transaction-and-engineered-narrativity/\n\nOfcourse if I had a button I would stop all of this technology now, I would push it. But for now this text\nhttp://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0504/msg00026.html\nI still think it is valid. That means the logical trajectory now if we do not act is 500 smart cities aka military zones and Mad Max in between. I do not want to live in neither.\n\nSo, Inge, you see, that without taking control the drivers of the digital transitions our societies can not survive. I live in a simple street. I would like to keep living three and be abler to take a train and have a coffee in a bar. That is all.\nAgain, hard to understand if you are of a different sensibility that I have no other interest in this then general interest. The selfish aspect lies in the fact that this stable society enables me to work and live as I want, quiet and simple.\n\nMy friends and my networks are willing to take up that position, to build leadership in a fully connected world. I hope edgeryders do too. Otherwise it is very easy from our own cosy and sheltered positions ( me too!) to say how bad it all is, and how afraid we are of the Matrix. That's too simple for us. \n\nNow to your specific question. I see a pattern there, interesting. \n\nTo me, all current systems are dysfunctional. Hence we need to build better ones. That is my sole objective.\n\nThe world is full of terrible political features. If you are not careful you can get depressed by simply looking at one. What can you do?

Introduction</h2>\n\nThis is a big picture document on the work from June 2019 - December 2019, with some activities going into January - March 2020. Below is the project summary as copied from our application document.\n\n\n**Project summary**\n\nBehavioral change can be a powerful force in helping to decarbonize the economy. But most people see it as buying small environmental benefits with large personal sacrifices. This is a hard sell, and has failed to happen at scale. We believe we have found an achievable route to a sharp reduction of the carbon emission of urban living, via behavioral change.\n\nFirst, we do not aim for incremental change. Instead, we rewire urban life into an entirely different configuration. Helped by an enabling space, people's interactions result in a low carbon footprint in a logical way.\n\nSecond, we see behavioral change as something communities, not individuals, do. To humans, any change is much easier when done as a group. We harness our species' evolved ability for working in groups, and put it to the service of radical behavioral\nchange.\n\nThird, we focus on people who aspire to behavioral change. Modern life has driven them from their communities of origin. Now, they long to build new ones, in reasonable balance with the planet. In Europe, these people are a sizeable minority. We, the\nproponents, are part of it.\n\nOur proposed solution is to reinvent the home as the main platform of urban living. We build a living community of trailblazers in Brussels, Belgium, called The Reef. It reconditions a single building, and offers it to 20 people aspiring to green, social living. \n\nThis community works as a testing ground for energy/waste reduction and circular economy solutions to make urban living greener. It strikes partnerships with local authorities, green innovators, real estate developers, financial operators. In so doing, it takes the lead in developing a new market for green-and-social urban living.\nAs solutions prove their value in The Reef, they become part of a \"social and green\" array of building techniques, space organization formulae, social arrangements and environmental technologies, all open source. The Reef itself acts as demonstration site and steward of this knowledge.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Work plan</h2>\n\nThe following sections are copied from our [project application document](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1DdBa7-5o4E1yzHe_sDorPsvdOYlibSYU). See there for full details.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. WP1: Partnerships, finance and business models</h3>\n\n**Background**\n\nA successful deployment of The Reef requires a wide array of resources and competences. In WP1 we build a partnership broad enough and diverse enough to succeed. Partners will only engage if they perceive clear opportunities for themselves and long-run sustainability. Such perception, in turn, requires a well-defined and realistic business model not only of The Reef itself, but of the ecosystem supporting it. It also requires transparent and fair governance to protect resources invested in the project.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n* **O1.1 \u2013 Establish 3-5 high quality partnerships.** A high quality partner is a partner who holds re sources and competences that are key for a successful Reef deployment. These include political and institutional legitimacy (public authorities), building expertise (real estate developers), a portfolio of real estate\nassets (public authorities/real estate developers/philanthropists), finance (banks or other financial institutions), green technologies (universities and private firms).\n\n    Partnerships are encoded in memoranda of understanding (MOUs). MOUs are pledges to engage in the deployment of The Reef, conditional to certain conditions being met. For example, a bank could commit to providing access to credit to individuals wishing to\nbuy a (tradeable) right to live in The Reef.\n\n* **O1.2 \u2013 Found an organization as a vehicle for the partners to run The Reef.** Create an organization under Belgian law, to be the investable vehicle for The Reef. Edgeryders itself is to be one of its partners.\n\n\n**Activities**\n\n* **A1.1 \u2013 Intelligence.** Interview at least 10 key witnesses to return a list of the key players in Brussels, and a map of their strategic goals. Results in D1.1: A strategic map of green-and-communal living in Brussels (text document as wiki). Feeds into O1.1.\n\n* **A1.2 \u2013 Clarity.** Produce a minimum viable set of documents to illustrate The Reef's concept. This might include a one-pager pitch, a talk-cum-deckof-slides, visuals. Feeds into O1.1.\n\n* **A1.3 \u2013 Business model and sustainability.** Carry out a triple-bottom line cost-benefit analysis of The Reef as a spreadsheet exercise. Do this in close contact with the community of WP3 and other stakeholders as co-designers of The Reef. The goal is to work out minimum efficient dimensions and key drivers of impacts, costs and revenues via sensitivity analysis. By implication, the CBA contains The Reef\u2019s business model, where financial revenues and costs balance.\n\n    Results in KO3: A triple-bottom line CBA of The Reef (spreadsheet). Feeds into O1.1.\n\n* **A1.4 \u2013 Partner engagement.** Run 6-10 meetings with potential partners, sounding them out for engagement in The Reef. Results in D1.2: 3-5 signed MOUs with quality partners. Feeds into O1.1.\n\n* **A1.5 \u2013 Governance.** The Reef is, at least in part, a common good: its services are rivalrous and non-excludable. This situation calls for sophisticated governance arrangements. Produce a governance arrangement, rigid enough to protect all parties, but flexible enough to accommodate emergent patterns of cooperation. To do this, review the existing arrangements that have proved to work best, and improve upon them. Many of these spring from the neo-cooperativist movement and the experience of post-capitalist enterprises. Results in D1.3: A statute of incorporation for The Reef organization. Feeds into O1.2.\n\n* **A1.6 \u2013 Incorporation.** Raise the initial minimum capital and incorporate the new organization. Feeds into O1.2.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. WP2: Community, lifestyle change and demand-side</h3>\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Reef is part technological hardware, part social software. It cannot succeed unless technological innovation is adopted and adapted to a real need and demand by the very people who would live in it, and tell the story forward. In WP2 we focus on discovering potential Reefers: residents and/or technical contributors to the making of The Reef. In the process, we will build a community of innovators who generously share and reflect on a vision for communal living and well-being in the city. In our use of the term \u201ccommunity\u201d, we do not discriminate between high stakeholders (i.e. investors in WP1), future residents, or one-off event participants. Everyone who contributes to the project is considered to be a community member.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n* **O2.1 \u2013 Build a directory of future residents and design \u201cwish lists\u201d.** We will map aspirations, expectations and skill sets available among potential Reefers in Brussels, and design a flow that connects these with the technological and architectural design: for example, what is an inside temperature range that ensures communal and individual comfort, needed to be factored in for a green energy grid, yet still meet our targets? What are the \u201cno go\u201d\u2019s when it comes to ensuring enough individual privacy, or enough separation between social and working spaces in the building? Which types of entrepreneurial, livelihood making projects are people interested in?\n\n* **O2.2 \u2013 Create a mini-strategy for social cohesion in the neighborhood.** This is a preliminary effort to connect The Reef with its surroundings an d maximize its impact in the urban ecosystem. It results from mapping the co-design and green reconversion plan for the candidate buildings onto pre-existing conditions and public policy priorities.\n\n**Activities**\n\n* **A2.1 \u2013 User Cases for rental and ownership in The Reef.** We will engage in research and conversations to clarify t he demand side of the market, by meeting relevant \u201cprofiles\u201d: young expatriates and families, freelancers and precarious workers or unemployed with less reliable financial prospects, cultural groups pushed out of living and working studios due to rising costs. We will talk to cooperative organisations already working on fractional ownership. This task results in a public narrative report (D2.1).\n\n* **A2.2 \u2013 Participation and co-design.** We will host up to three community events inviting potential owners, residents (i.e. digital nomads, young people in precarity, migrants), and contributors (i.e. circular economy experts, urban gardeners, biodesigners, artists) to view and begin designing candidate spaces. The events focus on practical information sharing and place-making in the context created on the building scouting. Tentative formats are:\n\n    * \u201cWalkshops\u201d, or walking workshops, are scouting tours of proposed site(s) for the Reef, gathering a group of people who will engage in imagining green living situations, while walking and reflecting together on what is being seen i.e. opportunities offered by the neighborhood. The tours are a good opportunity to recruit participants in subsequent community building and green reconversion activities.\n\n    * Narrative Prototyping is where we present The Reef as a common inspiration point, and ask participants to connect their personal experiences to the narrative. The workshop results in a list of collective priorities which need to be answered by the Reef design and a map of collective skills and resources available to move forward (for an example of tools used, see here).\n\n    All events will be:\n\n    * small-sized (circa 15 participants), to allow for constructive and processable conversations\n    * inclusive: advertised through open calls on social media and Brussels online portals, in English, French, and Dutch\n    * highly interactive, before, during and after they take place. We use the Edgeryders online platform to reflect on the ideas\n    * discussed, produce a record of ideas kept and discarded, and build continuity between the events\n    * distilled into a list of key requirements to inform and support WP3: Green reconversion.\n\n    Overall, this activity is synced with A3.1 (Identify underused buildings) in WP3. Also, most active contributors will be invited to the Green Transformation Idea Sprints (A3.3) or meetings for Governance (A1.5), depending on their skills and interest. It results in\nD2.3, D2.4, D2.5.\n\n* **A2.3 \u2013 Storytelling and shared documentation.** All the activities in A2.1 and A2.2 will be announced and documented extensively on the Edgeryders online platform. All the outputs and deliverables will be shared online and publicly with participants, local or other audiences, in order to ramp up enthusiasm and build local capacity for the project as a whole. The whole of the documentation constitutes research data for meeting O2.2. and develop a neighborhood strategy for at least one of The Reef variants (see O3.1).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-3\">2.3. WP3: Green Transformation of Buildings</h3>\n\n**Background**\n\nHousehold and office space decarbonization does not yet progress fast enough or on a large enough scale. Especially the conversion of existing housing stock is difficult due to cost barriers and apparent lack of profitable investment opportunities in that area.\nWe will demonstrate a realistic plan of how old housing stock can be economically converted to very low carbon footprint with decisive, unconventional interventions (and, of course, a community eager to understand and use these new technologies). Initial\nplans will be developed for the exemplary real estate objects we are interested in for The Reef, and expanded on for global dissemination and uptake.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n* **O3.1 Green Transformation Plans for 2 or 3 exemplary buildings.** Informed by the financial boundary conditions (resulting from WP 1) and the co-design process (resulting from WP2), we will produce plans for the green conversion of 2-3 specific buildings that we identified in Brussels as suitable candidates to house The Reef. The buildings will be selected from different building types and different local environments, so the plans will also differ. The level of detail in these plans will be chosen so that professionals can execute the work on that basis, while lay users would have to research the more basic skills and techniques first in other sources. Likewise, cost details will be included as needed to make the investment decision and work plans and can be refined once one of the buildings has been secured as The Reef.\n\n* **O3.2 Green Transformation Manual for Buildings.** A manual for emergent green home technologies that can speed up and scale up the ecological transformation of individuals. It will be published under an open source licence and consist of (1) a technical documentation framework and (2) initial content that focuses on the green transformation of existing real estate. While this manual will draw from the green conversion plans to show techniques by example, it will expand on that content considerably by also including:\n\n    * short presentations of green building transformation techniques in use worldwide\n    * technological hacks and step-by-step do-it-yourself instructions\n    * ideas, literature references, links and inspirations that can assist inhabitants and builders in solving future challenges and in further developments towards carbon negative and eco-restorative buildings\n\n    The goal with this manual is explicitly to make the current \u201cbleeding edge\u201d knowledge about deep green living accessible to the owners and inhabitants of real estate and to the architects and builders assisting them. Carbon negative buildings must no longer be the realm of design prizes, but become the default. Like with the transformation plans, the level of detail will be chosen for professionals but the content will be understandable by interested laypeople.\n\n    The proposed manual will become an enabler of grassroots-driven radical green transformation of buildings because, to our knowledge, no similar resource currently exists. Everything available is either (1) incomplete and not practical enough or (2) concerns \u201cappropriate technology\u201d, which is applicable for developing countries only or (3) not freely available and not open source, which limits the accessibility and usage rights of the material so much that no movement can form around it.\n\n    For reference, the closest match of existing content is Low-Tech Magazine. It treats questions of low-impact living with in-depth articles that are often at least somewhat relevant for urban living, for example: \u201cIf We Insulate Our Houses, Why Not Our Cooking Pots?\u201d. However, it does not specifically cover building transformation, and is more research oriented than directly practically useful for enabling lifestyle changes. The manual is a community effort in both its creation in this project and its later maintenance and expansion. For that, content authoring and maintenance will be integrated with our modern online forum system on edgeryders.eu, its global community, and an emerging community of practice for green building transformation that the manual can attract to online forum. With this approach, content maintenance stays organic and low-cost.\nTechnically, new manual versions in PDF and EPUB e-book formats will be generated regularly and automatically from selected online content of the forum. That content can be edited collaboratively by all users, with Markdown providing consistent formating.\n\n    Another advantage of integrating this content with our online forum is that we can comfortably integrate multimedia content: images and videos can already be embedded there, and for this project we will add options to embed 360\u00b0 photos (via Kuula or Pannelum) and 3D objects (via Sketchfab). Both of these can also be viewed with VR headsets, including those made from a smartphone and \u201cGoogle Cardboard\u201d.\n\n**Activities**\n\n* **A3.1 Identify suitable underused buildings in Brussels.** We will organize a collaborative mapping and investigation effort to find buildings in Brussels that are most suitable for The Reef. They may be publicly or privately owned, have to be unused or severely underused, large enough, available for negotiating longterm access, and both the owner and zoning regulations must allow considerable intervention in the building. During this activity, we will take care to develop a preliminary set of best practices, such as using an open source collaborative mapping tool like uMap or FacilMap. Results in KO6: a map with the geolocations of 100 or more vacant buildings we encounter, and detailed profiles of 2-3 of these buildings which (after talking to the owners) meet all of the above criteria.\n\n* **A3.2 Study visits to green building transformation projects across Europe.** Once the major challenges of each selected piece of real estate have been identified, we will select complementary successful green transformation projects across Europe and send team members for a visit to learn about and document the solutions they found. These existing transformation projects might be found in both urban and rural areas, and we would document the insights with interviews and open storytelling across the Edgeryders network. Aside, we will also be scouting in the projects\u2019 networks for green transformation experts that can contribute to our Green Transformation Manual. Results in D3.2: 4-5 high quality blog posts containing the interviews\u2019 highlights and the main insights from the visits.\n\n* **A3.3 Hold 2-3 Green Transformation Idea Sprints.** To collect relevant input and feedback from professionals and enthusiasts of ecological construction, we will hold a one-day idea sprint event in each of the 2-3 selected candidate buildings. The input of the attendees is documented on video and feeds into our Green Transformation Plans for these buildings (see O3.1) and the Green Transformation Manual (see O3.2). We plan to invite a mixed group of (mostly) Brussels-based sustainable architecture experts, interior designers, ecological innovators and builders / craftspeople. In exchange for their creative input and feedback, we provide them with a valuable experience of socializing with likeminded people, interesting short-format idea presentations (including about our draft concepts for the buildings at that point of time) and, of course, ecologically sustainable food. By holding these events in the actual buildings or very close to them, participants can demonstrate their ideas on the actual object. In addition, these events also contribute to growing the community around The Reef in Brussels.\n\n* **A3.4 Write the Green Transformation Plans and Manual.** With all the input collected in A3.1 to A3.3 together with sources from literature, around the web and our own expertise, we will use our collaborative platform edgeryders.eu to create the 2-3 Green Transformation Plans for the candidate buildings (implements O3.1) and on that basis, the Green Transformation Manual for Buildings (implements O3.2).\n\n \n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3.

I will integrate his answers into the manual above in the next days. For now, enjoy the questions.\n\n\n## Regarding construction and building conversion\n\n* **Management and budgeting of construction projects.** Basically, what is the standard practice to estimate the cost of renovation and conversion of a building. Before going into details (calculating materials needed etc.), hopefully there are good rules of thumb based on building type, size, age and the intended type of conversion? Where do we find these numbers?\n\n\n## Regarding compact living\n\n* **If you had to create a space-saving furniture system for tiny houses, how would you approach this?** The challenge is that all the tiny houses are different and space restricted, so the same furniture will not fit everywhere \u2026\n\n* **What are good approaches for splitting a warehouse style space into small living spaces so that the conversion takes up little embodied energy?** And ideally, one could still switch flexibly between usage as a large space and usage as smaller spaces.\n\n* **Lighting and ventilation solutions for windowless rooms?** Which can happen as a result of space sub-divisions.\n\n* **Modern dorms.** If you had the task of designing a modern dorm that is comfortable for \u22656 adults, including couples, how would it look like?\n\n* **Flexible room use.** We want to set up a communal living scheme where people do not have fixed rooms but rather get a room only for the time when they are in the space, and based on their current needs. What would be good architectural interventions and interior ideas to make moving between rooms comfortable even if people had to do it every other day?\n\n\n## Regarding minimally invasive conversion\n\n* **Minimal conversion techniques.** Which ideas did you practice already or think about regarding minimal, ecologically friendly adaptation of spaces that you occupy? For example, the exposed brick wall idea in the communal kitchen of Bosch Tanneurs. Anything resulting in \"shabby chic\" optics and that uses salvaged materials (or no materials at all) is highly appreciated.\n\n* **Decorative salvaged materials.** What old, salvageable materials can be re-used in a decorative manner to modify rooms in such a way that they look \"old, shabby chic and used but authentic, warm and nice\"? This relates to floor covering, wall covering and indoor insulation.\n\n\n## Regarding energy efficiency\n\n* **Nice window-less kitchen and living room.** Heating-wise it is efficient to have the warmest rooms (kitchen and living room and bathroom, but not toilet) in the center of the building. How to make them nice and livable even though they will have very few or no direct windows to the outside?\n\n* **What to focus on re. household energy efficiency?** So far we focus on heating, and partially cooking, as the areas where interventions can yield the most energy savings. Any area we are missing?\n\n* **Office space with small heated spaces.** For heating efficiency in the office, we are looking for designs that split a large office into smaller heated spaces while still being a nice place to work, with frequent and good contact to colleagues. A row of small meeting rooms will not do it. If you had to do this, starting from a large footprint office (15\u00d715\u00d73 m), how would it look like?", "created_at": "2019-12-19 12:19:20.345489", "updated_at": "2019-12-19 17:23:50.525549", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 544, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 43.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5538], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72759, "user_id": 5843, "topic_id": 12886, "post_number": 23, "raw": "Thank U very much", "created_at": "2020-03-27 23:00:27.478057", "updated_at": "2020-03-27 23:00:27.478057", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 8.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [72644], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54882, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10326, "post_number": 38, "raw": "@markomanka indeed!", "created_at": "2019-06-11 13:07:04.574851", "updated_at": "2019-10-04 15:01:20.063757", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 46, "score": 19.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [54758], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81258, "user_id": 5479, "topic_id": 14185, "post_number": 15, "raw": "This graph is after my coding.

It\u2019s a network of coworking space and co-living spaces, hosting both local and international entrepreneurs, who work remotely from Gran Canary in the Canary Islands.\n\nIt can be hard to make a small coworking space sustainable, but the business became more interesting when we evolved, in response to demand from freelancers from all over the world, to establish three co-living spaces.\n\nCo-livers have 24/7 access control via an app. This is crucial to our sustainability and more importantly, empowers co-livers to take ownership of the space. Work environments aren\u2019t just people in a space together, they are about interacting and generating positive synergies with coworkers. As more companies become remote-friendly, it\u2019s important that community remains a priority.\n\nOur response to COVID has been more physical than technology based so far: no sharing of desks, minimum distance respected, and more demand for private offices. More generally, 5G will open opportunities to work in rural areas where connectivity currently is a challenge.\n\nWe started our coworking space out of our own needs. We had a spin-off project that needed to be relocated and we had a property available. We decided to prepare that property for ourselves, but as it was large enough to host other companies, other entrepreneurs, we decided to make it available.\n\nWhen we started, we didn\u2019t know too much about the whole coworking industry. It was more of a concept of a shared office. And we weren\u2019t aware that that was happening five years ago already in our hometown. And that\u2019s when we first decided to fully focus our coworking space into digital remote workers. And as this evolved, the second problem that we encountered was, that they needed flexible accommodation, which basically wasn\u2019t being offered in our home city. And that\u2019s how we started our first co-living, almost three years ago.\n\nThat actually worked out really well. It was a great experience. And it also made our business more interesting. A small coworking space, as you know, it\u2019s sometimes hard to make sustainable. Ours was already sustainable, but the co-living actually made the business even more interesting. And that\u2019s why we actually decided to invest more resources into opening more co-livings. And we kept the coworking sites the same.\n\nOver time, it evolved, in not only maintaining the original coworking space, but actually opening up three co-living locations, connected to the coworking spaces. But all our co-livings also have a workspace in-house. So, our co-livers are free to work from home, or actually walk over to the coworking space if they want.\n\nI don\u2019t think that we are really special. We are just really focused on the value proposition that our city, our destination offers. And again, we are really focused on hosting remote workers. And therefore, trying to solve all their pains, in order to make sure that we can facilitate as much, their [softlanding 00:15:38] in the city, to maintain their productivity as much as possible, and also allow them to engage with an interesting like-minded community of professionals, so that they also feel like home while they are working remotely from Gran Canaria.\n\nOne of our co-living locations, it\u2019s a very interesting architecture. It\u2019s a 300 square meter penthouse, with seven bedrooms, a very large, almost 600 square meters of rooftop terrace overlooking the ocean. So, the problem that we actually have at The Roof, that\u2019s what we call it, is that co-livers don\u2019t ever leave The Roof.\n\nSo, even if we encourage them, sometimes you come to the coworking space to connect and meet with the rest of the local community, and other coworkers from other co-living locations, they actually prefer to stay at The Roof, and work from there, enjoying the outdoors. So, sometimes it\u2019s hard to make them leave the house.\n\nWe have looked into technology aspects and solutions. The idea for the spin off from our family business was to implement open source solutions for companies, replicating what we have done and implemented in our own company. Our family-owned business is for efficient tech solutions for hospitals. I have an engineering background I\u2019m always interested in technology. So, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve always been, somehow, interested in the whole field.\n\nIn terms of technology, I know that many other coworkers that have seen a lot of very, very interesting tools, that could be interesting if we had a larger scale, so if we had larger coworking, or even provided more services.\n\nBut then, also, I need to explain that, at the coworking space, it was not our primary business.\nWe needed to be very practical, in terms of particularly investing, to make sure that our business was sustainable. In order for the technology aspect of business itself to make sense, we had to keep our investments shorter on that side. If we had more skill in our coworking spaces, so if we have planned to open other coworking locations, we will probably have invested also more in technology.\n\nOur coworking location is very small, we can only host a maximum of 30 people at once. We always kept it simple in many ways, although found over time, some interesting tech solutions that solved some of our pains.\n\nIn terms of COVID-19 we are still evaluating how the situation evolves, and to see what the new normal is going to be like. Just look back, and think, how many changes and new regulations have we had over the last three months. If we had implemented, or done things for each of them, we\u2019d be first, crazy, and second, I\u2019d spend a lot of money. For a lot of this, it\u2019s not only for working spaces, it made more sense just to close, and wait until there is some sort of near-reality that they can understand, and know what the new rules are.\n\nSo far during this period for us Technology has not helped much more than before because most of the time our coworking space was closed. So, that has been the case for us. And, we will have to see, because we are still evaluating the different measures that need to be implemented, obviously still under a very small rate of usage, in terms of occupancy in the coworking space. So, we\u2019ll have to see how things evolve, and we\u2019ll have to analyze it, if there\u2019s anything else that we should implement, in order to comply with the new regulations under the new situation.\n\nDuring the first period, the first two months, we had to close down the workspace. There was just too much misinformation. The rules weren\u2019t clear, and most of coworkers have the ability to work remotely. So, they don\u2019t need to go to the workspace. They go to the workspace, because they like the atmosphere and the resource that we make available. But they can always work from home.\n\nSo, as most of them decided to stay home, we also decided that it didn\u2019t make sense to have the workspace available. And, we have just recently, two weeks ago, made it available again to current coworkers, and since last week to new coworkers.\n\nThe first measures that we have implemented are not connected to technology. So basically, what we did in the space was, we canceled the helpdesks. So, we separated the helpdesk, and made only permanent desks available, so that every coworker only gets to use their desk. And, there\u2019s no sharing of desks. Also, we implemented regulations to make sure that the minimum distance was respected within the space. Obviously made available all kinds of products for disinfection of hands, we have a face mask available in the workspace, if anyone wants to pick one up, because they missed their own. Obviously increased the cleaning.\n\nWhat I see more demand, is to have private offices. Because of the current situation, a lot of businesses that have decided to leave their office space, want to replicate what they had in their office in a coworking, or in a flexible space. Therefore, request private areas, so that they can bring in their teams, and have their own office space. And also, because of obviously, security reasons, and health reasons connected to COVID. For example one of the things that I\u2019ve seen being questioned, are actually the phone booths. With COVID, nobody wants to go inside in a phone booth. They feel that, everywhere you touch, you\u2019re going to be infected. There is certainly a challenge around it.\n\nFor example if video conferencing rooms are needed, they actually are needed, and they need to be larger. So, that\u2019s a huge challenge for a coworking space, because they have to allocate a lot of space, and it\u2019s not going to be used the whole time, just temporarily, for this. And if there\u2019s several people wanting to have a video call at the same time, then it\u2019s a big issue. There\u2019s no easy solution for it. But, we have to see how things evolve. And, eventually, as I\u2019ve discussed with other coworking managers, I think that we\u2019re going to see two phases from now on. We\u2019re going to see the pre-vaccine phase, which is the most difficult one, and we\u2019re going to see the post-vaccine stage, which you never know when that\u2019s going to be. But, eventually the things are going to go back to a new normal, that is similar to the old normal.\n\nWe\u2019ll probably have to see what happens in both. And, that\u2019s why in other hands, we\u2019ll be taking cautious measures, in terms of, we haven\u2019t invested in, I don\u2019t know, a lot of separations, and all kinds of accompaniments that people are trying to sell now, with the coworking space, because we don\u2019t really know how long the situation is going to take.\n\nAnd also, just thinking out with a little bit of common sense. We know that everyone working in the coworking space is taking a risk, unless they wear one of those dry suits. They\u2019re going to take a risk, no matter what you do. So, it doesn\u2019t make sense for a coworking space manager to invest on daily cleaning, or twice a day, or every hour, or \u2026 I don\u2019t know how many different cleaning ratios I\u2019ve read about \u2026 or all kinds of different tools. Those investments might go into the trash after the vaccine is developed.\n\nSo, we as operators, particularly those who run small spaces like mine, that are hard to make profitable, or even sustainable, need to really be cautious about it, because otherwise \u2026 we\u2019re already losing money, because our spaces are empty. If we invest a lot of money that is going to be trashed, that\u2019s even worse.\n\nFor us, in terms of technology, what I would emphasize, what has been super important and a lifesaver, it\u2019s the access control.\n\nSo, to have the facility on with an app, to be able to grant or cancel access to anyone in our community, to access the coworking space. Also, since we are not there as members all the time, or as managers, the visualization of what\u2019s happening in the space, so we have a couple of webcams on each floor, so that we can make sure that everything is okay, and there is no issues.\n\nIn order for our coworking space to be sustainable again business-wise, our coworking space is self-managed, meaning that every coworker has 24/7 access through an app that they can have on their phones. We don\u2019t have a member of the team presentially there, or during even office hours. Sometimes I\u2019m there, sometimes one of my colleagues is there, but sometimes there\u2019s nobody there.\n\nIn the coworking sector there is some nervousness about costs, about losing that personal touch, with putting in access technology. But in our case the opposite happened. Because when we took away the artificial host, some of the more stronger community members came forward, and became the host. Normally, new coworkers normally request appointments, in order to be shown the space etc. But sometimes people already using the coworking space take the role of the managers, and actually they are the ones, if somebody comes up without notice, and just knocks on our door, they are the ones who take care of it. it\u2019s better, because it doesn\u2019t have to be always the same person. Otherwise, it becomes a job. Right? Imagine that that particular person is busy at that time, on a video call. If she feels that she has to leave the video call to attend the person, then it doesn\u2019t work. If there\u2019s someone else around, and knows the dynamic \u2026 and funny enough, particularly with the new ones, see another coworker that they know that he\u2019s not part of the team, he\u2019s just another coworker, doing it, then they\u2019re like, \u201cThis is cool. I want to do it too.\u201d\n\nit\u2019s our responsibility as managers, to detect who are those people that don\u2019t mind, and actually enjoy doing this. And just engaging in an informal conversation with them, and be like, \u201cHey, would you mind doing this if there was the case?\u201d And normally, the answer is always yes. And it works really well\n\nWe implement the same strategy in the co-living space. And at the end, our way of thinking about this is that we implement the infrastructure. We implement the site services. But, we empower our co-livers, our coworkers to take ownership of this space, as if they were part of it. And that not only solves us a lot of problems, and makes us work less, but it makes them be part of it, and feel part of it. And it works very well.\n\nAlso I think the third tool that has been also for us a lifesaver, which we didn\u2019t have at the beginning, was obviously a tool to outmake the invoicing.\n\nSo that, in order to reduce the amount of administrative tasks, and time spent on that, a tool that can generate after monthly, the invoices, and send them, and make the payments easy for our customers. That has been also an important part of the tools that we have used.\n\nIn the short term, we are thinking about just implementing tools connected to sales and marketing.\n\nSo, we\u2019re looking into implementing the CRM, and we\u2019re also looking into the tools to automate our bookings a step further, so we make them available online. And also, we\u2019re looking into improve the access control in the co-livings, as the current doors that we have at the co-livings are mechanical, they are not electrical. And, it\u2019s a bit tricky to automate access with those, and make sure that it doesn\u2019t become a recurring problem, in terms of maintenance. Those are the things that we are looking into at the moment.\n\nOne of the general thoughts that I could share connected to technology is, I believe that 5G, so wireless connectivity, will certainly change some of the needs for coworking spaces. Up until now, were a solution for remote workers that couldn\u2019t find good connectivity anywhere else. And I think that 5G could actually make that happen. In fact, we\u2019ll also probably allow people to work in from areas that it is impossible to work at the moment, like rural environments, et cetera, and with very, very good capacities and capabilities, as if you were connected in an office space.\n\nSo I think that\u2019s always going to bring challenges, but also opportunities to the flexible space. Also, connected to COVID, more and more new office spaces being started in rural areas where people decide to move to, but they also want to also go to a space where they can gather with other workers in their regions.\n\nAbove technology, the main reason, at least for us, why customers join our coworking space is, because they want a work environment. Work environments is also connected to community, because if you don\u2019t have more people, you don\u2019t have a work environment, you just have an empty office.\n\nBut also, to interact, and to generate positive synergies with other coworkers. And I see that this is even going to become more important, particularly because of COVID. I think that more and more communities are going to have to suffer from loneliness, and they are going to need that community aspect. So they\u2019re going to look for it, and they\u2019re going to be part of a community. And I think that flexible and coworking spaces have a lot to say. And for that, they definitely should be a priority to, not just provide a service, but also care a lot about the community [inaudible 00:25:06].\n\nCertainly we are watching how things evolve, and trying to understand the new trends. For example, one of the things that we are looking forward to, is to open new co-living locations and coworking locations in rural areas within the Canary Islands. I think that will provide a very good experience for those who visit us.\n\nWe\u2019ve been mostly focused in a rural are here in Las Palmas De Gran Canaria. But right now, because of all of this, and because we see that this is a trend, and more and more people are asking for it, we\u2019re also looking forward to develop our network into those areas where more workers are wanting to be.\n\nRural co-livings they already exist in many places, and I think that they play a very important role, and they add a lot of value. But, on certain regions, where there\u2019s already a community of remote workers that don\u2019t want to work at home the whole time, and they would prefer to go somewhere close in their rural area, where they can be with other remote workers. I think that also, there are going to be coworking spaces offering services.\n\nI am very positive about the future of flexible work spaces, because of their connection with remote work, basically. We see more and more companies worldwide becoming remote-friendly, or even remote-first. And, all that workforce, it\u2019s going to look to relocate, or to stop going to the office, and probably start using their closest coworking space, if they don\u2019t want to work at home.\n\nSo, this whole transition that we\u2019ve lived through over the last three months, where we have seen remote work evolve five or 10 years in three months\u2019 time, I think, it\u2019s certainly going to make a positive impact on the flexible workspace. And there\u2019s going to be a lot of new opportunities for operators.\n\nOne of the challenges is to defend the interest of the private sector in coworking. It\u2019s very common in many cities, in many regions in Europe, that there is a lot of coworking spaces financed by the public sector. Sometimes with conditions that compete against the private sector.\n\nFour years ago we created the Association of Coworking Spaces of the Canary Islands almost four years ago to ballad together, in order to make sure that the public sector was aligned, and that they were doing fair competition with the private sector. But also, it was an interesting way to connect, exchange, find different synergies between the different spaces that were spread out throughout the seven islands.\n\nIt was reactivated because of Covid. There are a lot of new operators in the Canary Islands. Right now, we have about 70 spaces in total, spread out through different islands. And the interest around the association was really high, as everybody understood that this was a very important time to stick together, to exchange information, and try to create positive synergies together. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been up to in the last weeks.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n![37bc7a02ea7da6c5578c05f5ec5daaf8051be294_2_1380x776|690x388](upload://sWERRANdZc0cFVUI7ea9sTuu3Q4.jpeg) \n*This conversation is part of our event on 21/7.

Actually, I recommend it, to everyone but to you, Matt, in particular. And _of course_ it is an arbitrary agreement, when you think about it. Humans (who are different) need to agree on what is  important, what has value. The book has a historical section: the physiocrats in 17th century France believed that only agriculture was \"production\"; an ironsmith would be an unproductive worker, a kind of service provider, whose living was underwritten by the farming class. In this sense, the ironsmith would be as useless to society as a duke's valet (or the duke himself). Smith disagreed, and pointed out that manufacture is also productive, but disdained services, and so on. \n\nSo, the agreement on what has value and what does not has been evolving \u2013 which makes sense to me. It's politics, and ethics, not science. It is also fitting that it should be encoded in a U.N. standard, since that makes the nature of GDP as a convention more transparent. \n\nThat said, a hardline marginalist economist would tell you that there is an element of science encoded in the current concept of GDP. This: under certain (highly restrictive) conditions, individuals are led by their preferences to transact on the market until they achieve their optimal mix of goods/services/leisure. In the process, prices form to carry information about the marginal social value of all goods and services. This is proven as the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics. It means that each transaction increases someone's well-being. GDP, at its heart, is the sum of all transactions, net of double counting (intermediate goods are incorporated into final goods rather than counted, like in VAT calculation). \n\nOther economists (including non-hardline marginalists like Stiglitz) are aware that, even if the math checks out, the first theorem requires certain conditions to hold, *and these are not met in reality*. So, the theorem itself is irrelevant to real life.", "created_at": "2019-05-21 07:23:46.366524", "updated_at": "2019-05-21 07:23:46.366524", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 381, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 54.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [53696], "is_reply_to": [53696], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77044, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13565, "post_number": 3, "raw": "yes, Frank Coughlin put it together as part of his OpenCare fellowship work, could get in touch with him and see if he could connect us directly with the people in El Salvador?", "created_at": "2020-05-20 10:06:31.263782", "updated_at": "2020-05-20 10:06:31.263782", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [77043], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79017, "user_id": 3816, "topic_id": 13414, "post_number": 20, "raw": "Great.

Dieser Prozess richtet sich nach den formellen Aktivit\u00e4ten, Ressourcen und Kapazit\u00e4ten, die im Projekt zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen.\nAlle Rekrutierungsm\u00f6glichkeiten werden im Gemeinschaftsforum als offene Ausschreibungen bekannt gegeben.\n7)    Wir m\u00f6chten uns gegenseitig helfen, unsere F\u00e4higkeit zur Analyse und Interpretation von Informationen zu verbessern. Wir analysieren und strukturieren die in unseren Gespr\u00e4chen geteilten Informationen, um den Wunsch und die F\u00e4higkeit der Gemeindemitglieder zu unterst\u00fctzen, sich durch Fakten, Statistiken und andere Informationen konstruktiv an der Gesellschaft zu beteiligen. In einer Welt der allgegenw\u00e4rtigen digitalen Konnektivit\u00e4t hilft uns die Verbesserung des Zugangs und der Nutzung von Informationen dabei, uns in den gegenw\u00e4rtigen \u00d6kosystemen und Gesellschaften sinnvoll zurechtzufinden. Ob es nun darum geht, lokale Probleme zu l\u00f6sen, Regierungen zur Rechenschaft zu ziehen, teure Fehler zu vermeiden oder Neues \u00fcber die Welt, in der man lebt, zu lernen - Wissen ist Macht.\n8)    Wir k\u00f6nnen nicht versprechen, dass es eines der von den zeitgen\u00f6ssischen europ\u00e4ischen Populisten aufgeworfenen Probleme l\u00f6sen wird. Es ist f\u00fcr uns alle gedacht, unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob wir mit den populistischen Argumenten \u00fcbereinstimmen oder nicht, das Bewusstsein zu sch\u00e4rfen, Informationen und Erfahrungen dar\u00fcber auszutauschen, wie wir als Gemeinschaft mit diesen Problemen umgehen.\n9)    Denken wir daran, dass wir eine vielf\u00e4ltige Gemeinschaft sind. Das ist entscheidend: Fast alles, was wir erreichen k\u00f6nnen, beruht auf dieser Vielfalt. Es ist wichtig, dass wir f\u00fcr den Zustrom neuer Menschen, Einsichten und F\u00e4higkeiten weit offen bleiben. Das bedeutet, dass wir akzeptieren und ber\u00fccksichtigen, dass der Einzelne in der Lage sein sollte, seinen eigenen Grad und Stil der Beteiligung zu w\u00e4hlen, solange dies die Autonomie der anderen nicht einschr\u00e4nkt.\n10) Wer die Arbeit macht, hat das Sagen.

I think it\u2019s been pretty clear from the start that we intended to use tags for this purpose and I didn\u2019t see any problem with it myself.[/quote]\n\nEmh, no. I think it's pretty clear [from the above](/t/12063/28) that I strongly proposed YAML (or JSON) in Discourse posts for all flow of structured data from Discourse to webkit software. And then there was no reaction, so I just remembered today to bring this up again.\n\nLet's ascribe it to miscommunication. For the future: when I really want something adapted in a software design where it's not my role to finally decide it, I usually frame it as a proposal and indicate that I really would like to see that happen. That's just about being nice, playing part of the team rather than commanding people around or showing disregard for their software design skills. But I only propose something that way if I think it's significantly better than what I have seen so far (and here that includes the event and team tagging in Owen's earlier iteration of webkit-like software).\n\nSo please, for the future, take this kind of change proposal seriously. Otherwise there will be a mess later and we'll have to change things around to tidy up, anyway. As for myself, I'll try to remember that I better tell that something is unacceptable here in Discourse (rather than making a constructive proposal for an alternative that is then ignored as a mere suggestion). My role here is to tidy up and keep Discourse organized, while yours (for this project) is to find new uses for Discourse. Both has its place \u2026\n\n[quote=\"hugi, post:54, topic:12063\"]Do you have a solution in mind that we could implement without having to re-do what has already been done?[/quote]\n\nTags are just a selection mechanism for topics. So by switching to another such mechanism, no need to re-do much of the implementation.\n\nFor example for events that are about displaying a feed of events collected on the Discourse platform anyway, the mechanism could be:\n\n* all topics from a category, such as \"[Internet of Humans \u2192 Events](/c/ioh/events)\", that have a date field set using the Calendar plugin\n\n* all topics tagged #event plus #project-ngi-forward\n\nBoth of these are mechanisms already in established use on the platform. One of them uses tags, but these tags already exist and are useful for users of the Discourse platform. So if one of these is a sufficient solution for the use case, no need to invent anything new or to introduce redundancy. \"Find the system, follow the system.\" In fact, the more a website is generated from organic content found in Discourse rather than from content specifically written for that website, the better \u2013 because that's the unique ability of the webkit, beyond just serving as a text editor for website content.\n\n*However*, for the events that seem to be the common case for the NGI Summit website (like [this one](/t/12756)), my above proposal of using YAML inside Discourse posts seems more appropriate. It's exactly made for cases like this. I would put the whole conference schedule into one YAML block, similar to putting a whole team into one JSON block [here](/t/11338/2). Reasons:\n\n* These are rather short session descriptions, not something that you expect Discourse users to extensively comment on. If you'd want comments inside Discourse for this content, of course topics would be the way to go.\n\n* They contain some structured information like \"Location: [\u2026]\" and \"Speakers: [\u2026]\" that lends itself to YAML much more than to a messy parsing of Markdown / HTML to extract that information from post content.\n\n* Since these are small chunks of content and usually will get no comments on Discourse, it is wasteful to represent them as topics in Discourse. Topics are the second-highest level of structure in Discourse (below categories), so creating a lot of topics where there is no need means a lot of structural clutter. It's like having a PhD thesis with only first-level headings and paragraphs and nothing else. Instead, when structuring something, I always try to find the adequate means within the toolkit of whatever is available to structure information in a software.\n\n    I think that this point applies even when it's about content that is \"only\" meant for being displayed on an external website, with little relevance inside Discourse. Because: this content has to be in a public category to be accessible by the webkit, so you can't keep these topics out of people's \"New\" and \"Latest\" lists. When using (for example) posts inside a single topic for this content, these lists would be much less cluttered for users. In order to make the webkit a useful Discourse-based CMS product for wider use eventually, I think that's an important point to raise about its interaction with Discourse.\n\n**tl;dr** Selection by tag is fine for tags that serve a purpose for Discourse users \u2013 so keep that feature around. But I'd generalize that topic selection mechanism to also allow filtering by category, by availability of a certain custom field, perhaps by topic author, perhaps by is-wiki state. The advanced Discourse search function is your friend for this. For all remaining cases, custom Discourse tags can probably be avoided by the YAML-inside-Discourse scheme I proposed (plus hardcoded topic-and-post references in the webkit site's configuration file). No issue if you have to do the NGI Summit with the custom tagging as started now, but please try to make the transition directly after that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**P.S.:** The use of the #ngi-summit-stories tag is indeed a pretty good use case for a Discourse tag. Because it's working on organic content of the platform that may appear in any category, and there are few tools beyond tags that could be used to mark it. My only comment here would be to not tie the tag name to a specific event, but to frame it with future re-uses of that tag in mind, including for users of the Discourse platform itself. So maybe **#ioh-featured** or **#ioh-featured-story** would do?", "created_at": "2020-03-07 17:43:32.205495", "updated_at": "2020-03-07 17:53:13.873947", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1070, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [71029], "is_reply_to": [71029], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 43851, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 8454, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Hi and welcome!

For seniors who live far away from their grandchildren and kids, FaceTime is nothing short of a revelation.\n\nHugi raises a good point about NGI and its priorities.  I see a lot of focus on privacy, but little about basic accessibility and basic UI.  One would think that UI design would be more settled in a way than it is now, but that is a kind of pipe dream I guess because it is too easy for a rank amateur to make a website.  And all too often some smooth talking salesperson will sell a big institution on their design when it has not been vetted at all for good UI.  I see a version of this almost every day. and speaking of seniors, I take care of my 94 year old mother and my mother-in-law is 90.  To get them help and care and such, we have to use a lot of institutional websites.  So many of them are just lousy designs.  Often I feel sorry for the solo senior with poor eyesight and slight grasp of the underlying design having to navigate some of those sites..", "created_at": "2019-11-26 22:10:23.801668", "updated_at": "2019-11-27 16:03:27.509953", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 255, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 21.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [65795], "is_reply_to": [65795, 65817], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41562, "user_id": 4034, "topic_id": 8024, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Also, another person of great insight is @thomasmboa.

I'm going to go through the points I made in that post more explicitly as they relate to the Open Village project and to future projects, as well as reflect on the co-occurrence network generated from the Open Village coding. \n\nLet's start with the co-occurrences network. \n\nIt seems to me that we need to implement something of what we have discussed with @melancon on multiple occasions -- a way of creating code hierarchies. One of the reasons this graph is somewhat difficult to read is that there are a lot of higher-level codes that don't carry that much specific meaning (e.g. \"obstacles\"; \"improve community\"; \"supporting community\"). These kinds of codes are definitely useful (think back to the \"community-based care\" code in Open Care that carried a lot of meaning in its co-occurrence with other codes). But because they are more generic, they are more likely to co-occur with other codes, as they apply to a wider range of concepts. You'll find obstacles in places as disparate as recycling (to draw from this project) and domestic violence reporting (to think back on other projects). Also, I'm interested in how 'obstacles' is productively different than 'problems' which appears in the lower left hand part of the graph. (If there is no productive difference, they need to be merged. There is also 'problems of education' which is its own code despite there being  'problems' and 'education' codes).\n\nThis is why the ethnographer coding for SSNA has to be careful with these kinds of codes. Even more general codes have to have a precise meaning. So my concern with this particular ontology, for example, is that I can't see a clear difference in meaning between \"supporting community\" and \"improve community\" based upon co-occurrences or in my own mind. As a result I think they need to be merged or clarified. \"Community-based care\", for example, went through a few different merge/fork iterations, swallowing other codes that were being used interchangeably with it and forking from codes that were meaningfully different (such as 'peer-to-peer', for example, which community members were using in a specific context). \n\nSimilarly, how does 'sharing knowledge' differ meaningfully from \"collaboration\"? I can certainly imagine a few scenarios in which they'd be different (there are kinds of collaboration other than sharing knowledge, for example) but would expect more of a code network around to let us know. \n\nI'd love to know how collaboration and obstacles connect, and am confused as to why there aren't more codes surrounding those two. I can imagine if they co-occur so much that there should be codes co-occurring with the both of them that might illuminate WHAT those obstacles to collaboration are, or how collaboration can overcome obstacles! Those are the code co-occurrences that make SSNA so useful. \n\nThere are also codes that don't have a clear meaning to me in isolation or in their network. What does \"authorization\" mean? Perhaps it is like our regulation - safety - existing system failure nexus in Open Care-- looking around it, it's possible that lacking proper authorization (not sure from whom in this case) leads to obstacles, or vice versa? \n\nLet's crawl out of those weeds for a moment and look elsewhere in the larger picture. I'm interested in the quitting job - job dissatisfaction - passion triangle. I can imagine (and from reading many of the posts) I gather that a lot of people feel a lack of passion in their current employment situation. I also see unemployment, but am interested in why it is unconnected to that nexus. \n\nSimilarly, I'm interested in why 'education' is unconnected with 'sharing knowledge'. But education - volunteering - community health could be interesting! How does education relate to community health? Are we talking about mental health or physical health? I'm also having difficulty clicking on nodes to see the conversations beneath to dig deeper, but I will give it another go soon. \n\nAs @alberto mentions in [this post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-ssna-of-the-mena-open-village-conversation/9161), the graph does illuminate solutions (and potentially the issues as well: job dissatisfaction, unemployment, potentially authorization, and funding problems (those are two different linked codes)). I definitely get a general sense of problems and solutions from the graph. I also feel a renewed sense of confidence in the method: even in suboptimal coding conditions, higher levels of meaning are still emerging in the social semantic network that allow us to get a big-picture view of a conversation as a whole.\n\nMoving on from that brief discussion of the codes to other lessons learned. \n\n1. It's clear to me that we need people with explicit experience in both ethnographic research/writing and qualitative coding/data analysis. A lot goes into ethnographic coding that can be invisiblised, but in order to have high quality outputs there have to be high quality inputs. This graph to me illustrates a lack of underlying rigour in coding practices --- merging similar codes, forking codes that have distinct meanings, generating codes that have a clear meaning, and coding thoroughly enough to create maps of co-occurrences. You can view my other post for a discussion of why coding fidelity is fidelity to our community members and is therefore a very important task. In future projects I therefore think it is imperative to take the time to onboard people with explicit experience and who demonstrate a committed attention to iterating in coding practice. \n\n2. Flakiness test. This process was rife with flakiness issues --- we lost a few people early on who had committed, and ended up re-onboarding a person who had originally disappeared. More periodic disappearances occurred after that, making the entire process frustrating. In future projects, we need people who commit to showing up for calls, since we are going to have to communicate frequently across language coding. Frequent and open communication is vital to make sure the coding starts high quality and remains that way throughout so that the emerging graph carries meaning. \n\n3. Open Codebook. I talked about this in the last post, but in order to ensure rigorous coding I think we need to keep a codebook which allow us to keep our coding decisions rigourously supported and also easily communicable to our teammates.\n\nAdded later: I am also realising as I do this that the graph is an excellent way of doing code cleanup in a supervisory capacity (e.g. as the one not doing the coding)! If I had this throughout while supervising someone I could much easier actively advise them on where to look to potentially improve or clarify their codes.", "created_at": "2018-11-26 17:14:02.556100", "updated_at": "2018-11-26 19:20:52.045166", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1177, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 148.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60680, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10733, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I need to have news from @AskaBednarczyk about confirmed workshops/talks, and then we will ask the questions around the sessions - give us a few days, week tops", "created_at": "2019-10-04 13:18:02.968163", "updated_at": "2019-10-04 13:18:20.520766", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [60677], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51142, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 9277, "post_number": 24, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2019-02-27 06:28:40.978750", "updated_at": "2019-02-27 06:30:55.238201", "deleted_at": "2020-01-21 19:29:33.445229", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1743, "user_id": 41, "topic_id": 1710, "post_number": 1, "raw": "After traveling and living in various societies,\n\nI realize that, depending on the environment,\n\nthere will be more or less potential to develop initiatives and experiment.\n\nThis depends likely in great part on the culture,\n\non the awareness, on the type of economy, on the demography, on history,...\n\nDepending on a variety of factors,\n\nI realize potential for initiative may depend greatly on environments in which the \"young\" have power and influence,\n\nor if the enthusiasm and initiative building of the young is hindered by the power of the old.\n\nI wonder if there is specific research into this ?\n\nWhat are the societies in which we are , as young people,\n\nthe most likely and able to develop initiatives, finding other people to collaborate with ?\n\nI remember, when I was in Romania,\n\na number of managers where very young.\n\nWhy ?

Millions of plastic items are improperly disposed of on a daily basis, creating piles of plastic waste everywhere. This has brought serious damages to local environments around the world in terms of water, air and soil pollution. It blocks drains, pollutes rivers and wreaks havoc on the environment.\n\n**The Story Began...**\n\nI was watching a TV show, where Moroccan former interior minister, announced that Morocco has decided to take action to eliminate plastic bags through its campaign \u201cZero Plastic Bag\u201d, to ban the manufacture, commercialization, and importation of plastic bags. Then I realized that the best solution for disposing of plastic waste is recycling it to produce new materials that are sustainable and recyclable. Which mean a product that can be recycled to create added value and a real Circular Economy. As social entrepreneur and change maker it was for me the right time to start doing an acting to address this issue and have a real impact on my community and worldwide.\n\n**Dream to Action, From \"A\" to \"Z\"*elij Invent***\n\nAs a first step the idea is to develop, a new material based on plastic that can be used such as cement in construction product and more.\nMy first research led me to create an eco-friendly paving stones and floor tiles made from plastic waste. That can be used in all the same ways as regular products in gardens, sidewalks, parking and more, but:\n\n- use less energy and water in production,\n- are cheaper to produce\n- offer better insulation and are more durable than most alternatives.\n\nEverybody wins! Zelij aims to eliminate more than 3000 tons of plastic waste every year, while reducing resources used in manufacture and energy use for customers.\n\n\n![PAVERS|690x501,75%](upload://ldnOpFvSwcZqQQINpcYwRZ2xNud.jpeg) \n\nThanks to the OCI Lab program, we discovered several tools and we explored several new methods.

The most incandescent issue is how to raise awareness about the problem and mobilise small farmers into changing their ways. They produce traditionally, but how do we make them stop using herbicides and pesticides?\n\nWe do have small farmers and fortunately, we don\u2019t have abandoned land like in other countries because our farmers didn\u2019t lose their feeling of being the owners of the land and basically continued to do what they did before the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s take the example of Vojvodina, the Serbian part of the Pannonian Basin. The farmers there have been for years engaged in big-scale farming: they replaced the manure with artificial fertilisers, and the results are catastrophic: the layer of humus is being depleted at unprecedented speed, just like everywhere else where traditional farming is replaced by monoculture and industrial crops. **This is what we fight against as [an association](http://amacentar.org).** Last year we commissioned a social scientist to write a booklet on food sovereignty in Serbia and **our message to the policy makers is: food safety is one thing, and food sovereignty completely another. Food sovereignty is not a novel concept, but it boils down to this: you don\u2019t depend on food imports, you are self-sufficient and a sovereign producer of the food you eat.** This contravenes the order of things in the early 21st century: in the name of free trade, you have to honour dubious agreements you made with international organisations, import heavily subsidised food from the Big Ones and sell your land to foreign companies. **The greatest danger of all is the onslaught of the big agrobusiness coming to Serbia.**\n\nOn a personal level, my focal point is Southeast Serbia. I think the key issue is decentralisation, even in food sovereignty. What applies in the rural communities of the Balkan Mountains (Stara Planina in Serbian) doesn\u2019t apply in Vojvodina. However, we\u2019ve been taught for years to abandon the old ways, and it\u2019s become a part of our mindset. \n\n### What to do with the mindset of people who had been forcefully fed the narrative spun by traditional agricultural experts and big companies for forty or fifty years? And now we tell them to go back to what their grandfathers did?\n\nLast year we made research in Croatia and Serbia and published a study titled [Growing Growers](http://amacentar.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Young-Farmers-and-Food-Sovereignty%E2%80%8B-STUDY.pdf), financed by the Erasmus+ programme. A few dozen young farmers in both countries participated and were asked what they did and how they made a success of their farming. However, the elephant in the room is that they mostly follow traditional farming principles, apart from a precious few: they are family businesses indeed, but they do big-scale farming and produce high-yield industrial crops. But what we want is to preserve our biodiversity, in the first place. Everything else comes second - if it means lower yield, so be it. We should be happy to produce enough food for ourselves. However, large market chains can afford to sell the produce for cheap or even at dumping prices, meaning that the price is lower in Serbia than in the country of origin. And our farmers can\u2019t compete.\n\nThe authorities do nothing about it. We are living in neoliberal times. Nobody is asking the farmer, nobody cares for him. It\u2019s success or boost. Whenever we advise the consumers to buy food at farmers\u2019 markets, make personal contact with the farmers, they say: why should I do it if I can buy the same at a discount in a big supermarket? It is hard to convince them that those prices are often below the cost of production. This is a fact: big agribusinesses lobby hard all over the world, including Serbia.\n\nI have friends in Southeast Serbia who are passionate about preservation of indigenous animal breeds: the Balkan Donkey, water buffalo and very rare Busha cattle, famous for their milk with fat content higher than 6%. In this area, they do receive some support by the Ministry of Agriculture which has some sense for this.\n\n![Capture2.PNG|690x192](upload://ZomFogLt6aLA5Ztb1E6tE3EjcU.jpeg) \n*Meet Cvetka (Tsvetka), a silky-haired happy little Balkan Donkey, a goddaughter and a proud member of the \u201cLet\u2019s Defend the Stara Planina Rivers\u201d Movement*\n\n### We have to do a lot of footwork with the farmers.\n\nThese are smallholdings managed in a traditional way and the subsidies from the state can cover some 50% of the cost of hay fed to the animals. Labour costs, maintenance and everything else is on the farmer. One of the owners is thankful even for that because otherwise he couldn\u2019t survive, but it needs much manual labour from his family. Personal contact seems to be the only way to convince the farmers: if one has an eight-hundred-gramme potato fed on fertilisers (which are, in my opinion, nothing more than junk food for plants as it makes them fat, lazy and tasteless), who is this stranger coming to tell one to go back to manure and much more work? But if one goes back to the old ways, old plant varieties, one will have a three-hundred-gramme potato with incomparable taste and sell it at a much higher price.\n\n![|624x351](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sZgKHX1EP6It75lcc-4iXUsXHCxO1-LwjxlAyZTSlf1RAvq7-NqqBl-EWgUNoJ0MOdTf7XIPnXoN8LTfpirSPkjOYYiGEcCXH0_Daw3XAGbRw-NmFB7ZpcWA1fHORH_vYAI2ro1T)\n*Locally produced courgette. Just spade, shovel, rain and compost. No machines allowed.*\n\nLet\u2019s compare our farmers with their peers in the EU: the only way the EU farmers can compete in the market is through heavy subsidies. It is not a fair game if you make a handsome income by money coming both from your government and the EU coffers, and somebody else, outside the EU, is forced to succumb to the forces of the market.\n\n**Let\u2019s stop pretending: don't try to sell us the pitch to go into markets and be competitive, and bailout and/or subsidise big players who then come to us to compete with our farmers who barely make ends meet.**\n\nIn my opinion, the governmental subsidies are the main way to do it. No money? Okay, take some from what you gave to your chums, the big players you socialise with and pat on the shoulder.\n\nThere\u2019s the [IPARD II Programme](https://www.mei.gov.rs/eng/funds/eu-funds/ipa-instrument-for-pre-accession-assistance/ipard-ii/) for support in the field of rural development, available to the Serbian farmers, but only a handful made it: most funds are left untouched at the moment. The procedure is too cumbersome, the people don\u2019t have the skills to write projects and the farmer has to provide as much as 50% on his own, which is hardly possible.\n\nWe *do* have to educate farmers, but how to visit those who live three hundred kilometres or more from the capital, in a mountain without cable television and Internet? Does the government really think they are able to write \u201cprojects\u201d? I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s more likely they will recommend an \u201cindependent\u201d agency which will do it instead.\n\nMost subsidies go to large-scale farmers, because they know how to ask for it. It is a tremendous task for us to do much footwork, visit many, many villages, talk to the locals and convince the government to change the policies, volens-nolens.\n\nIt is hard but true that small villages can feed the seven-million population of Serbia. If the people feel the taste of the local food, when they go home they are more likely to stop buying in the big markets and nearly everyone would benefit. Just the big players would be unhappy. That\u2019s the key. Here in Belgrade I have a few farmers I trust, I have their numbers and I call them to order their produce. Word of mouth is a very important way for messages to come across, and I want to believe it\u2019s possible.\n\nThis is how I see the global order - we can\u2019t see the rot. Food can\u2019t be cheap, end of story. This means you have to give up going to big shopping centres, buying expensive mobile phones, as you will be forced to use this money to buy food. In twenty years, many of us will face heavy water shortages, not only you and me, but big companies as well. In the collapse of a civilisation which doesn\u2019t seem so implausible any more, what will you do if you can\u2019t go to your local supermarket for your food? This is why local farming matters.\n\n\nIn the next post: **[How do we bring people back to rural areas and support local food production?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-do-we-bring-people-back-to-rural-areas-and-support-local-food-production/14682)**", "created_at": "2020-10-23 08:57:50.203510", "updated_at": "2020-11-20 10:16:04.015646", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1540, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 200.8, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670, 6658, 3, 8, 5, 2915, 3293], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69139, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12479, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Might take a bit of study.

Your passion pops up from the screen, (nearly) literally :slight_smile:\n\nOne thing to add: citizen engagement is fundamentally unfair for one more reason. **There is a self-selection bias for people who can afford the time/effort to participate vs the people who cannot.** E.g. families with small kids where both parents have full-time jobs probably find it more difficult to participate, in contrast to well-off, older couples with leisure time to spend (where kids left the household). To say nothing for people having 3-4 mini-jobs, struggling to make ends meet, or immigrants and other groups with whole different sets of challenges. (You touched at this, but goes beyond simply not knowing/being disillusioned with \"what's in it for me?\" - they objectively cannot contribute.)\n\nNormally it wouldn't be such a problem (someone might say) - after all, everyone spends their time as they see fit. But **when we talk about participatory democratic processes, no one can be left behind.** So I guess it's up to the rest of us to lower bars/design inclusive mechanisms/meet people where they are/etc. No pressure :slight_smile: (Yet if you are passionate about these things, 2020 is the place to be. Exciting times!) \n\nOf course things are as you say; disillusionment is a major challenge, and politicians is/can be another.

Though all ideas are welcome and eligible for consideration, but we particularly encourage ideas that address climate change through innovation and technology.\n\nIn first stage, the selected social entrepreneurs, also called projects&rsquo; leaders in this program, will be invited to community calls moderated by &ldquo;OCI Lab&rdquo; Team . In these calls, the projects leaders will have the chance to pitch their ideas to their peers to receive feedback or to explore areas of collaboration. Mentors and Experts form the Edgeryders&rsquo; Community will be also involved in this process to provide assistance and advice for each one of the projects&rsquo; leaders. To successfully complete this phase, each project leader must give constructive feedback, with the guidance of the &ldquo;OCI Lab&rdquo; Team to at least 5 other projects during the calls, and through the follow up conversations on the Edgeryders&rsquo; platform.\n\nIn the second stage, &ldquo;OCI Lab&rdquo; will connect the successful projects&rsquo; leaders from the first stage, to &ldquo;Contributors&rdquo;. A &ldquo;Contributor&rdquo; is anyone who has a set of skills and wish to take part in one of the incubated ventures. The &ldquo;Contributors&rdquo; are invited to apply also through the Edgeryders-Open Village platform where they are required to briefly introduce themselves, their skills and the areas they wish to work on. The &ldquo;OCI Lab&rdquo; team will match them later with the projects leaders so they can help them further develop and successfully implement their projects. Aside from the rewarding experience of contributing in meaningful and impactful projects, the &ldquo;Contributors&rdquo; will apply to join one of the project leaders, so together they form a founding team and continue working on the project. Each project leader can select at least one and up to 3 contributors. Follow up calls between the projects&rsquo; teams and the Edgeryders&rsquo; mentors and experts will take place in order to continue on providing the needed support.\n\nIn the final stage, &ldquo;OCI Lab&rdquo; team will select 4 projects by evaluating all projects, the progress made and the quality of collaboration among the &ldquo;Project Leaders&rdquo; and the matched &ldquo;Contributors&rdquo;. The teams of the selected projects will participate, with all the travel expenses covered, in the OpenVillage Festival that will be held in Brussels in April 2020 (Changes on the date or the place may occur). During the Festival, the teams will have an opportunity for networking, by meeting their European peers, international experts and mentors, and potential investors. All selected teams will also have the chance to pitch their ideas in front of the Edgeryders Community to win a seed funding up to 7000 $ so they will be able to start implementing their social or green ventures.\n\n&ldquo;OCI Labs&rdquo; will open a call for application for both the &ldquo;Project Leaders&rdquo; and for the &ldquo;Contributors&rdquo;. Selected participants in the two categories will be notified, and given the necessary instructions and assistance to start the process of the P2P online mentoring as described above.\n\nFinally, and in order to expand the outreach of our program, we will work with different non financial partners, including community spaces, coworking spaces, incubators, entrepreneurship programs, in order to identify and recruit the &ldquo;Project Leaders&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Contributors&rdquo; among their communities. &ldquo;OCI Lab&rdquo; is a great opportunity for the members of these communities to use the power of collective intelligence to develop their projects, and also to benefit from the support that the community of the Edgeryders can offer.", "created_at": "2019-08-17 16:26:43.709788", "updated_at": "2020-09-24 15:05:17.746478", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 749, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 113.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 8, 5400, 3782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67455, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 12152, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Congratulations to everyone who got selected for the program! :yellow_heart::yellow_heart::yellow_heart:\n\nEspecially happy for @HadeerGhareeb:\n\n[quote=\"OCILab, post:1, topic:12152\"]\n**5 - Didi_Asks - Social Game - Egypt**\nLed by Hadeer Ghareeb\nA multiplayer card game that aims to enhance communication\n[/quote]\n\nAlso Hadeer, if you ever need inspiration for more questions, you can just make an account on [OkC](http://okcupid.com/) and start answering the questions there.

This happened after the prototype had folded and moved out of Matera, in late 2014. Billy here was not involved in the unMonastery itself that I recall. Divergence begat frustration and frustration begat a lot of bickering and people feeling hurt and putting up drama, myself included. During this, things heated up. Some people broke badly netiquette, and we banned them, as netiquette advises. But then, we:\n\n* pushed out the former Edgeryders director responsible for a lot of the drama and lack of transparency.\n\n* made an effort to improve governance and increase transparency. This includes publishing [legal and financial information](/t/help-info/5661); the [statute of incorporation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12ZG1uege0VUg_KA6avwrWocVfrbMeKzI); making netiquette more explicit; [explaining](/t/the-administration-edgeryders-lbg-group/4619) we have our own internal admin group (d'oh) and how it works; adopting an [explicit policy](/t/how-admin-powers-are-allocated-in-edgeryders/4586) for bestowing admin powers over the website and setting up an [advisory board](/t/advisory-board/4738) where people from the community have full access to all information and participate in the governance. This latter was a failure: after the controversy died down, no one was that interested in working with us, making us proposals, etc. \n\nDuring all this, in January 2015 some of the people that had participated in the unMonastery prototype in Matera incorporated a company called unMonastery. Nadia and I were offered by Ben Vickers to become members, in explicit recognition of our contribution to the new endeavor and as a way to bring about closure to this mess. We turned down the offer, but wished them well, [and we did so publicly](/t/edgeryders-and-unmonastery-what-changed-and-what-remains-the-same/4991). We also reserved the right to continue developing the idea on our own. With that, closure was achieved, as far as I am concerned.\n\nWe never heard from them again. But [Companies House records](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09407178/filing-history) show that Vinay resigned as director in August 2015; Ben Vickers resigned in October 2015. The company has now a single director, Arthur Doohan, whom I no longer trust.\n\nMeanwhile, the lessons from the unMonastery have produced [The Reef](/t/spawning-the-reef-re-inventing-communal-working-and-living-again/6239). The Reef is very concrete. We have a prototype. I live in it. It's not funded by grants. It might fail, and if it does we will learn from that failure too. \n\nOther people can, and hopefully will, take the unMonastery lesson in other directions. We try to help and support a bit those who do. For example, we took part in the [preMonastery](/t/freeflow-creativity/779) experience in Galway, championed them vis-a-vis the organisation in charge of delivering the Galway 2020 Capital of Culture programme and hired Bernard, the driving force behind it, for a small gig.  \n\nOur principles are lofty ones. It is difficult to live up to them. I would argue the Edgeryders core group, though deeply imperfect, does this better than any other group I have been involved with, and I am incredibly proud of being a part of it. I would also argue that time has shown that we were always more interested in building things than in fighting for their control.", "created_at": "2017-07-17 20:35:00", "updated_at": "2018-04-11 09:58:58.057724", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 581, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 28.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33461], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82731, "user_id": 6417, "topic_id": 14291, "post_number": 6, "raw": "yes, I am registered as well.", "created_at": "2020-09-03 17:14:11.303018", "updated_at": "2020-09-03 17:14:11.303018", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 7.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [82692], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71115, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 179, "raw": "Here is a link to an audio interview I did last week with Patrick O'Keefe who does a podcast popular with members of the online community management world.

While significant attention was paid to themes of technology, the internet and the environment in the latter part of 2019, 2020 has brought on a range of new topic areas, with crucial insights from a range of community members. In this report, we discuss some of the most salient themes we have observed thus far. We start with a broad overview, then dive into the Semantic Social Network to map these topics out based upon how community members are talking about them, and with whom. \n\n## Recurring Threads and New Conversations\n\nOver the last four months, community members and managers have focussed increasing attention to the Covid-19 Pandemic, including an [online event on the Surveillance Pandemic](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-results-of-the-community-listening-post-on-risks-for-freedom-in-the-wake-of-covid-19/13183) in April. During the call, members and invited experts discussed the risks and benefits of immunity certificates \u2013 as well as the uncertainty around immunity in general \u2013 the development and deployment of contact tracing apps and similar technologies; with most agreeing that the potential risks and harms to data privacy and civil liberties outweighed the potential for containing the virus. We also discussed, in great detail, the importance of coordination and cooperation across governments and communities, which many argued is more pressing than developing new technologies. We see more such events as a promising area for future analysis, as they generated deep and thoughtful conversation.\n\nThere have been a large volume of threads dedicated to issues around technology and Covid-19. Some key areas of community engagement include [e-learning and remote work during lockdowns](https://edgeryders.eu/t/remote-work-for-everyone-what-we-stand-to-gain/14192), the ways in which [big tech is benefitting from the crisis caused by Covid-19](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-second-coming-of-big-tech-in-the-age-of-covid-19/13564), the development and deployment of contact tracing apps across Europe and its implications for data privacy, as well as many devoted to questions of [the future of technology and work in the era of Covid-19](https://edgeryders.eu/t/remote-work-with-human-interaction-is-the-way-of-the-future/14035).\n\nWhile the Covid-19 pandemic has certainly been at the centre of community engagement, we also find a broad range of NGI threads devoted to other areas ( particularly in comparison to 2019) There are some recurring and overlapping topics in focus for the community, including detailed discussion on technology and surveillance, [the development of smart cities](https://edgeryders.eu/t/smart-city-data-narratives-to-collect-or-not-to-collect/12721), [environmental issues and deep green technology](https://edgeryders.eu/t/new-models-for-covid19-recovery-and-the-green-new-deal-a-case-study/13996), issues around [monetisation of online resources like journalism](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-is-to-be-done-about-the-ad-based-internet-economy/9821/32), as well as [Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ai-inequalities-and-justice-an-overview-of-all-documented-discussions-before-during-and-after-the-workshop/12014). One overlapping narrative in these core thematic areas is the need for destabilising the power monopoly that governments and big tech have over the future of the internet \u2013 and future of technology and its applications, more broadly. The consensus is often to (a) develop open source alternatives and (b) distribute control to a broader range of individuals and communities. The core messages being; rethink, reorganise, redistribute and improve. Interestingly, the problem statement is often at the institutional level (i.e. companies, monopolies, lack of strong regulation) but many of the proposed solutions are at the individual level (i.e. citizen education, individual open source code projects etc.). This may suggest a mismatch between problem and solution, which our community members have very actively and pointedly been addressing.\n\nParticularly in light of the international anti-racism movement, we see a wide discussion of the ways in which digital technologies, AI and surveillance tools both contribute to racial inequity but also can affect meaningful change: the development of facial recognition technology disproportionately puts people of colour at risk of being targeted by law enforcement which has significant impact on social and economic mobility and enfranchisement, algorithms \u2013 as they are currently being programmed \u2013 produce and reproduce racial and ethnic bias, the internet has become a key messaging tool for right wing and white supremacist groups, and there is still wide racial disparity in technology research. We recommend efforts to bring in the expert knowledge of community members working on these issues into our discussions on platform. Doing so will help us highlight and uplift technological developments that are affecting change, crucial to a project on the Next Generation Internet which informs European Commission policy.\n\n## Exploring the NGI Semantic Social Network: \n\nWe find the most interesting co-occurrences when filtering the graph to k=4. For those unfamiliar with our tool, Graph Ryder, this means that we are looking the connections between codes that have been mentioned together by community members at least 4 times. \n\nLet's start with an overview of the conversation as a whole at k=4. This is everything that everyone is talking about across the NGI Forum.\n\n![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 10.37.33|690x298](upload://6qDbOySZqGRT3Ze3ZsRgfJe3Oa5.png) \n\n![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 10.37.01|690x428](upload://gI95YlkItWt1KzLrt8k1VOFHiUJ.png) !\n\nWe can see some broad themes emerging as we look at the graph as a whole. Central nodes include codes like `personal data`, connected to codes like `business model` and `advertising`. From this `personal data` node, we get an idea of some of the issues community members are wrestling with. \n\nIf we follow the `personal data` code to `advertising` and `business model` to the left and `trade-off` to the right, we can see some very interesting debates emerging. \n ![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 10.40.30|690x419](upload://ku369nJgwHVoWVMm4XUc47Ah5Qm.png) \n\n## Trade-Offs and Decision-Making\nIt's clear even at this level that the use of `personal data` sets up a `trade-off` for a lot of participants. In `decision-making` about sharing or protecting `personal data`, community members are `considering larger context` around its use and `assessing the impact` of the trade-off. `cost` is also a key consideration. `Personal data` also connects strongly, if we move south, to `agency`, in a highly illustrative cluster with `control` and `user experience`. We see, again, trade-offs set up -- between `user control` and `user experience`, raising questions about what one gets when one gives up `personal data`, and how much control is possible. Community members also raise questions about the effort and `cost` of controlling personal data in the current environment, when responsibility is highly individualised (`individualising responsibility` is a salient code at a lower level of co-occurrences). \n\n![image|480x411](upload://pf6CT0S8qxiUJcHl5HqYFlOBWw7.png) \n\nMoving these abstract concepts into concrete examples, we can look at the left of `personal data` to see these applied to the specific case of advertising and `journalism`. Selling `personal data` for `advertising` creates revenue for `journalism`, without which there is an issue of `information quality`. But there are other potential `business model`s to be considered outside of the selling of `personal data`, like `subscription` models. We can also see that community members understand that `\"free\"` access to services is not always actually free, since the `catch` is the selling of their `personal data`. Yet `journalism`, without a sustainable `business model`, is facing some serious `funding issues`. The fundamental problem is about `assigning value` to things like journalism, which opens to the question of how to fund it without shady `advertising` practices. These are all strongly connected to the question of `ethics`, a key concern in `journalism` writ large which is closely tied to ethical considerations around advertising, monetisation, personal data, and how to construct a sustainable business model. \n\n## Regulating Big Tech, Finding Open Source Alternatives\n\nFollowing the graph north, we can see `business model` and `advertising` also connected to `monetisation` and `big tech`. A series of issues around `big tech` have been outlined by the community -- the need for `regulation`, the way it perpetuates `inequality` (`facebook` is a key example of `big tech`). \n![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 10.49.23|690x505](upload://xbiKTiFLfdXNRrN8rf39ARDl5zD.png) \n\nAlternatives to `big tech` emerge around `open source`, which has an interesting network built around it -- questions of `'empowerment'` (does open source empower users?), the need for `training` to use open source tools, and the question of whether using open source tools opens one up to increased `risk`. As a `technological solution`, open source also allows community members to `imagine alternatives` to the status quo. It also connects to `'human-centred design'`, as community members ask what exactly it would look like to design digital tools with and for humans.\n\n![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 10.50.39|690x576](upload://vsdMtX4r76aob6pi9OCopfmyfRp.png) \n\n`open source` also strongly connects with `privacy`, an extremely central node in the conversation. `privacy` connects back to `personal data`, and we see an illustrative network of privacy concerns articulated by the community: around `smart cities` and `human rights`, `covid-19` and `contact tracing`, and as aforementioned, `trade-off` and `decision-making`. A salient theme is the question of how to weigh up privacy trade-offs, in order to make optimal decisions about one's own data privacy. What does it `cost`? There is `uncertainty` around how extensive `surveillance` is, and a `distrust` of the information that one is given about these technologies, which makes making quality decisions about these issues difficult for community members.\n\n![image|505x515](upload://oV5qfJaw7McKsGCl6SfgVJV9oCm.png) \n\nAlso connected to 'trade off' and `assessing impact` is a series of environmental concerns. Moving to the bottom-right of the graph, questions of `resource consumption` and `energy` are tied to `environmental sustainability` and `cost`, showing us a snapshot of the rich conversation emerging on platform around technology, the internet, and environmental sustainability. \n\n![image|601x247](upload://tt6qFpMC7YA6pIpwaLQUXHkCiHv.png) \n\nReturning to the topic of trust in technology, we see an interesting web of concepts emerging around `artificial intelligence`.  AI is connected to `inequality` and `big tech`. It's also connected to issues of `transparency` and `oversight`, as well as `effectiveness`. This cluster of codes tells us that there is an ongoing conversation around what kinds of oversight of AI might a) be actually effective, rather than performative and b) lead to increased transparency of AI and `algorithms`. We also see these connected to more concrete questions on what it takes to make these technological infrastructures: their `production cycle` and the `raw materials` needed.\n\n## Co-Working, Sharing Space \n\nSince joining NGI Forward team in July, @katejsim has mostly been coding data about `co-working` and wanted to take the time to outline some preliminary findings. As the ego network below shows, we are starting to see some themes cohere around `co-working`. Since the pandemic, there is a growing `demand` for co-working spaces, including in `rural areas` with poor `Internet connectivity.` Co-working spaces, both formal and informal, are springing up to meet the technological and social needs of `working remotely` as workers relocate all around the world. Some have had to move for care responsibilities while others are relocating to areas in search of better quality of life. Whatever the reason, in the absence of the workplace providing natural space for social interaction, remote workers are seeking `a sense of community`. \n\n![Screen Shot 2020-10-04 at 2.03.24 PM|690x574](upload://KNCQIoyzdIRFtp0zTQGlfN4n3w.png) \n\nFor those operating formalised co-working spaces, their `managerial practices` of providing safe, clean, and `socially distant` working environment pose a real difficulty. On one hand, they want their services to `last for a long time` and see a real opportunity for market growth. However, with talks of the second `lockdown` and the uncertainty of social distancing guides in some countries, it is difficult to assess whether and how much to invest in operating or expanding facilities (`making investment`). For the moment, it appears that both the private and public sectors have responded to the demand for communal work spaces, but as the pandemic continues, operators are anticipating different business models for different sectors (`distinguishing between sectors`).   \n\nSome operators are turning to `technological solutions` like `apps` to monitor their facilities and regulate members' `access control`. This raises some questions about `privacy` but operators seem to find access control apps to be the most practical option for the moment.  \n\n**From loss to imagination** \n\nPutting co-working in conversation with other semantic nodes (at k=4) begins to tell a complex story about how the `shift to online` is restructuring social relations: \n\n![Screen Shot 2020-10-04 at 1.58.20 PM|690x550](upload://enLL9tUv4qKTjnqxIU3qqAYZ6K5.png) \n\nFollowing the threads around work from `COVID-19` captures the double bind of having the pandemic disrupt the fabric of how we organise our working lives. On one hand, there is profound feeling of loss: the connections stemming from `shift to online` are `public space`, `social engagement`, `mental health`, and `sense of loss`. For most people, being unable to access public spaces on their own terms has severely restricted their social interaction. The loss of companionship and feeling of community is contributing to erosion in mental health. This was especially prescient with `university` `students` as their social and intellectual lives have had to move online. \n\nAt the same time, this sense of loss has also generated new opportunities as social distancing measures are propelling participants to think and act more creatively (`imagining the future` and `imagining alternatives`). More on this below. \n\n**Sharing spaces, building communities**\n\nAnother strong connection emerging is on how `sharing` `work space` is contributing to a `sense of community`. Sense of community here captures both what co-working space members' desire and what operators are doing to bring people together. \n \n![Screen Shot 2020-10-04 at 1.58.44 PM|690x411](upload://12jm7DjknphrWTkpZPGOoNgRr6.png) \n\nSharing `work space` means having to share resources and, on some level, sharing, if not negotiating, values. Unsurprisingly, sharing work spaces with social distancing measures is incentivizing many to `set boundaries`. This code emerged from participants discussing how the burden of maintaining clean space often falls on those with higher standards of cleaning. (I've been having some issues with Graphryder on my computer where some connections are sometimes not shown, as is the case with `setting boundaries` here. Will discuss this at meeting tomorrow). In one recent thread I coded, a co-working space operator talked about the challenges of organising community-building events when everyone is experiencing `'Zoom fatigue'`. How do you bring people together when the one way to connect people is tiring them out? I'll be keeping track of this dynamic as our participants continue to reflect on the evolving social dynamics of `working remotely`.\n\n## Online-Offline Links, Zooming Out, and Defining Privacy \nFollowing on @katejsim's analysis of `co-working` above. I'd like to draw attention to the connections between the internet and online life and the concrete effects those have on life offline. We can see that `covid-19` has lead to an increase of `working remotely`, perhaps unsurprisingly. But it has also lead to a shift of living conditions, particularly `co-living` and `co-working`, totally reshaping the division of `public space` and `private space`, leading community members to `build alternatives` and `organising space` differently. \n\nPart of the impact of `covid-19` has been a `shift to online` and a corresponding` sense of loss`, of `public space`, of `social engagement`, with `mental health` impacts. One way of addressing this has been to seek a `sense of community` by reworking offline spaces to increase `social interaction`. For `students` and `universities`, this is especially pressing. \n\n ![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 11.00.11|690x558](upload://v6iYh3D5yl8mPXDEOkPflWfydqK.png)\n\n@alberto points out that there is an interesting structural anomaly at `k\u22655`. In the giant component (there are several small ones too, not shown in the picture), one single edge `personal data <=> privacy` connects two otherwise fully autonomous clusters. The left cluster seems to be about economic sustainability, business models and their social consequences. The right cluster is more concerned with values and the public sphere.\n\nHe asks: could this be a promising way of reading the data?\n![image|690x408](upload://2hRSZCatHMagH5LBgfvWSbS8LXk.jpeg)\n\nMy response is: Potentially. Although I think that the fact that big tech and privacy are on different sides of this might complicate this answer, because I think as we continue to code, big tech and facebook will creep over to the privacy and surveillance side of the graph, potentially disturbing this dichotomy. \n\nIt's also interesting to trace `privacy` as a code in general, because it's making us connect two things we often consider separate --- privacy on the internet and privacy in real life. I think we are going to end up writing something incredibly interesting on the way that people configure notions of privacy, how it relates to private and public space, and what kind of 'space' the internet is. Privacy and autonomy also connect to building communities, both offline and online. \n\nI actually think @matthias' [post on work-life balance vs work-life integration](https://edgeryders.eu/t/remote-work-for-everyone-what-we-stand-to-gain/14192/35?u=amelia) is going to be super interesting as a way in to thinking about this --- there's already great research on the disappearance of work-life separation, mediated by the dissolution of public-private boundaries enabled by the internet, and this is way pre-covid. \n\nThe great thing about anthropology is that it doesn't take these changes as negative (just like @matthias, who sees it as enabling him to live his life in a more integrated way that matches his own personal rhythm). The way this interfaces with living and working with others, tacking between `autonomy` and ` shared space`, `sense of community` I think is going to be absolutely fascinating. I also love the connections with `imagining the future` and `building alternatives`... the next generation internet is about more than just the online world, for sure, and I think what we bring to bear on it is this question of what it does to communities, how we make them, and how we imagine other worlds together, through our everyday practices.\n\nA code I want to keep tracking is of `defining terminology`, as NGI community members try to cut to the heart of some of the bigger, buzzier issues in tech and the internet. ![Screenshot 2020-10-05 at 11.06.13|375x257](upload://v12WT7NXFd0vvUK4UpxOYGzsL1f.png) \n\nThe code is meaningfully connected to `nuancing the debate`, telling us something about how to move forward and tackle the thornier, more challenging issues in this area in meaningful ways.

In a way that makes visible examples of how we will serve a pressing need for the person who would be signing the proverbial check. And will inspire enough trust that they will come to us with a problem to solve.\n\nThis is tricky as our offerings span across a broad range from software etc. And we need to not give an impression that any of our software/tools are ready to plug and play. \n\nRather we are closer to a think tank that is differentiated by two things:\n\n 1) People: unique breadth of in house expertise (people in the community who can be hired in as consultants and already have some kind of interoperability due to the platform). \n2) Scientifically sound methodology and bleeding edge Technologies: All work is backed by inhouse cutting edge science, technologies and tools that can be customised to meet a clients needs. \n\n**This means  we can offer a one-stop shop: Advice** ***as well as*** **Deployment.** \n\nWe have compiled a number of materials that give a comprehensive description of what edgeryders does and offers.

The company started in 2013 as a spin-off of a Council of Europe project.

We are continuously doing experimental work in the form of projects and ventures imagined and deployed by different constellations of individuals and organisations. Many are ephemeral collaborations that dissolve once the goals are met. Over time relationships form between people and organisations who choose to continue working with one another towards a shared vision. They become clusters.\n\n**How is this different from a network?**  In a network, participants look for how to make the most of what others are doing. In a cluster, participants are willing to re-orient their work, so as to better work with the other participants. If you are a social cooperative, you must look away from providing standardized services to customizing what you do in order to better valorize the capabilities of the people they are assisting. And so on.\n\n* **Environment and Climate** : EarthOS is our cluster of innovators around ecological living, ecosystem restoration and esp. climate change amelioration and adaptation. It is a set of experimental projects assembling community and diverse institutional partners to apply solutions to climate change and sustainability challenges in today\u2019s world as a house on fire. The findings from the projects serve as data points in developing new economic theory and models needed to enable transition to a sustainable future. ([More](https://edgeryders.eu/t/environment-and-climate/13485))\n* **Research & Development** : This cluster designs and deploys R&D activities including joint development of new open source technologies and common infrastructure upon which members can build new products and services. Members build meaningful research partnerships and pursue funding together. ([More](https://edgeryders.eu/t/research-network/13488))\n* **Good Technology** : This cluster experiments with what new technologies really should do for humanity and all it encompasses. Individuals and organisations in this cluster develop technologies guided by insights from open and inclusive dialogue on how technologies should work, be governed, financed and built. ([More](https://edgeryders.eu/t/good-technology/13496))\n* **Culture for Transformation** : This cluster connects and equips artists, producers, as well as researchers to experiment uses of culture as a tool for social change, and digital technology as a way to accelerate it.\n([More](https://edgeryders.eu/t/culture-for-transformation/13493))\n* **Distributed Futures Lab** : This cluster equips leaders and organisations to better navigate the new reality. Members build tools and frameworks for activities, ventures and programs that are ideated and deployed by large numbers of individuals working together over the internet. ([More](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-futures-lab/13476))\n* **One Health & Resilience** : This cluster takes a collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches to make sense of how to respond to links, interdependencies and commonalities of human and ecosystem health.

It needs to be tied to a meta description of the entire project, its different pieces and how they fit together. As well as the steps involved. For this I will ask Rita for help with the visuals. Or Malica who did the other visualisations.\n\nFor all other work, including the engagement managers I had an idea to bundle them as the work of collaboratively building a set of outputs via online participation: tour stops, conference and later LOTE (I have an idea i would like to Discuss with Dorotea which is to make this year's LOTE the big finale to the interactions and collaborations that happen through SPF).\u00a0\n\nRather than hire individuals, bundle the different kinds of work into packages to be implemented by teamwork with a set of roles defined that people can step into and a budget available for each group. People who join the working group for each country can step up to host the conversation and drive participation and engagement in it down the line (this will require much more work from one person who takes responsibility and support from peers). With incentives, why would you want to help? explicitly written.\u00a0\n\nI think it is much more engaging and generative to feel you are part of building something big together with cool people, and that the money is supporting this, rather than competing for temporary paid work. And we have the organisational design to support that claim. if people want to keep going, build more intiatives or draw more support around the local community we can help drive energy and attention towards their efforts.\n\nIdeally we would be using [Matthias] 's economy app to keep track of contributions but it's still too experimental. We can mention it as a step on the future roadmap, and see if anyone is up for trying it out as an experimental approach towards encouraging p2p collaboration on a massive scale.

He has been doing this for decades -- it is a VERY interesting approach from someone who is NOT an outsider, but a Peruvian who has been working on this approach not only in Peru but also worldwide since the 80s. No, not a statist approach, but perhaps even more interesting because it proposes a counter-narrative to the current one. Moreover, it is available to just those countries which do not have monetary sovereignty which would otherwise be forced into huge external debt. https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/monetizing-dead-capital-in-developing-worlds-informal-economy-by-hernando-de-soto-2020-07?utm_source=Project%20Syndicate%20Newsletter&utm_campaign=e180799b67-op_newsletter_2020_07_10&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_73bad5b7d8-e180799b67-93834185&mc_cid=e180799b67&mc_eid=16b2556e75\nHe writes in part: \"To realize these gains [capitalizing on gaining formal recognition of land rights and their subsurface minerals], one first must understand that capital creation is the result of an invisible chain that links existing property documents \u2013 records of who owns what, how, and where \u2013 to the documentary requirements of capital markets. Informals need to make that connection by packaging their documents according to law and accepted practices at both ends of the chain. That will give them the leverage to negotiate on equal terms with large-scale extractive firms that need to settle on their land to access the reserves beneath the surface.\"\n.\nMr de Soto is not your standard issue neolib -- he has been committed to improving the lives of informal workers for 40 years -- he chooses to do so using market mechanisms.

Come together some experts, discuss and produce some material on: \"How do we explain and educate in the four freedoms of FOSS to teachers and students\"?\n\n2. Then, a plan on how we run this education through our community in a good and way such as they too can teach others?\n\nThe rationale for this strategy is:\nSince computers and programming gets introduced very early in children's lives today - planting FOSS values is of critical importance in how the next generation of internet citizens reflect on software and its use/implementation. Today, they get pumped even in school, with the message from a proprietary world view: \"copyright\", \"limited use\", \"eula:s\", \"trademark\", \"Intellectual property\", \"patents\", \"digtal right managements\", \"activation codes\", \"geo blocking\", etc. etc. etc. These are the things taught in schools today.\n\nWe, as in IOH, need to work out a means to foster a generation that desire something else and it needs to start with a narrative that can be understood by teachers, students and people not experts in computer science.\n\nIn my role as Open Source officer at Scanai and board member of Open Source Sweden I can provide contact with higher academics should this develop that way, but its likely best to allow this to grow and develop inside a community that already share these values.\nI can also provide access to a \"test platform\" in form of a school (Gymnasium, 17-19 years) to test the education. I know a teacher that would love to participate in such a setup. I might even pull strings on the \"Gymnasiechefen\" in Stockholm, who happens to be a relative.\n\nThese above items are all \"possible\" paths later, but lets start small and create the education for ourselves first?", "created_at": "2019-05-13 20:21:57.722591", "updated_at": "2019-05-13 20:21:57.722591", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 301, "wiki": false, "reads": 35, "score": 62.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [53379], "is_liked_by": [4897, 5108], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72589, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 12164, "post_number": 224, "raw": "Pleeeeese can you put asid two of them for me if you ever come across them again?

My first encounter with a PC was when I was 14, and about 3 years after that, I've discovered blogging. I ran a personal blog (in my native language, Croatian), for about 3 years. That was just the time when Facebook became available outside of the US.

During my involvement with AIESEC, I took part in many seminars, conferences (as an organizer and as a team member) which were focused on doing good which can be better for everyone. I've started to follow Simon Sinek, Warren Buffet, Ken Blanchard, Gary Vaynerchuck and others.\n They influenced me in a way that you can use advertising to promote good and use it for good, not use it to trick people into buying things that are bad for them.

And perhaps we can already feel the ground starting to shift long before the scale of change is truly obvious.\n\nDuring the \u201cDeep Dive\u201d event in Valencia, it was indisputable that things have dramatically changed the last few years when it comes to Climate Change and the urgent need for collaboration between \u201cunlikely partners\u201d to increase the speed of this shift.\n\nThis is mostly the story of environmental organisations and the port of Antwerp and how we are trying to work together. To a large degree it mirrors certain dynamics and concerns within the ports of Valencia, Cyprus and Athens as well as what happened at the Valencia Deep Dive event.\n\n**The prelude**\n\nAntwerp is home to one of the largest ports in Europe. In terms of total freight shipped alone, it is second only to Rotterdam and both ports are easily within the top 20 largest ports in the world. Besides logistics, it also has a long history of petrochemical industrial activity, in more or less equal measure.\n\nAs is the case in ports and industry everywhere in the world, these activities have been coming under the spotlight due to their relationship with climate change. How can this economic activity and its use of fossil fuels be brought in line with the need for a massive reduction in CO2 emissions? And, even though there is a consensus that worldwide transportation and logistics will always continue to play an important role, it almost entirely rests on a fossil fuel dependent technology at the moment. While the IPCC and its climate scientists all over the world are sounding ever louder alarms as to the consequences of a significant warming of the average surface temperature, it is also widely acknowledged that current policies are not enough to keep our society within 1.5\u00baC global warming.\n\nNeedless to say this situation is highly alarming to pretty much every environmental organisation, including stRaten-generaal, the NGO I volunteer for. However, this is not exclusively a concern of environmental organisations. There are plenty of examples of governmental and legislative bodies, as well as commercial companies that voice the same concerns and that number keeps increasing as the realities of climate change manifest itself. At the same time, there are enormous economic drivers (commercial companies and national interests) involved which often point in exactly the other direction.\n\nVinay Gupta (an Edgeryders alumnus as @hexayurt ), would call this type of situation a \u201cgoat rodeo\u201d. It meets all the necessary characteristics: \n\n* The situation has multiple actors.\n* The actors have incentives to compete with each other.\n* Some of the actors are not rational, typically by virtue of failing to grasp the situation.\n* Finding a solution may piss off larger actors from outside the current situation, disincentivizing success.\n\nMore specifically, we could assign its severity with \u201cGoat Rodeo Index III: A dying industry; the extinction of one species.\u201d Although, in this case it is mostly species other than humans that are going extinct, which is why the current climate crisis can also be called the \u201c6th extinction event\u201d.\n\nWithout question, the petrochemical industry as it currently exists in the Port of Antwerp is entirely incompatible with the Paris Climate agreement and a boundary of 1.5\u00baC global warming. Under the assumption that we as a society are unwilling to accept the consequences of a 3-4\u00baC global warming, it\u2019s hard to escape the notion that this is a doomed industry, even if the petrochemical industry itself isn\u2019t capable of accepting this fact. A slightly more nuanced position would be to say that its current form is dying, although it would need to transform itself in such a radical way we might not even call it \u201cpetrochemical\u201d anymore.\n\nWhen it comes to shipping (freight), the situation is similar, but perhaps not quite as dire. At the end of the day, the shipping industry isn\u2019t strictly bound to fossil fuel. We will always require transport across our seas and oceans and ships can in fact do this quite efficiently. The most important thing to reconsider would be the propellant used. Interestingly enough, transport over water was for the vast majority of its history running entirely on renewable energy (wind). This is not the case for e.g. the current plastics and petrol/diesel industry, where there are simply no truly equivalent feedstocks to fossil fuel and its derivatives.\n\nClimate change is a crisis that is picking up more and more urgency as the years roll by. An optimist might argue that necessity is the mother of all inventions. Which means that the rate of innovation and (radical) transformation will only increase as the impacts of climate change become more and more clear. And, in some ways this seems to already be true. Notably the energy industry in Europe and elsewhere is already undergoing a massive transformation. Many people simply don\u2019t realise how quickly wind and solar energy is overtaking \u201ctraditional\u201d fuels like coal and (more recently) oil.\n\nOne of the most surprising realisations at the Valencia Deep Dive was the fact that many people are not aware of the speed at which development of hydrogen is currently entering the shipping industry. Even though Port of Antwerp is already planning to launch a \u201cHydroTug\u201d in 2022 and has lots of plans for hydrogen development, it was clear not a lot of people (even within the shipping industry) are aware of this rapid transformation. Similarly, organisations like Greenpeace, yes Greenpeace, have incredible reports showing not only the energy potential of wind energy in the North Sea, but also the rapidly changing economics of strict renewable energy (wind and solar).\n\nLooking at the energy density of solar and wind energy, one could even argue that energy from these sources could go very near \u201calmost zero\u201d the coming decades. It may sound weird, but electricity from 100% sustainable may become incredibly cheap and abundant much sooner than anyone expected. This is, by the way, also the reason why nuclear energy as a source might very well be a completely redundant \u201cdiscussion\u201d: nuclear energy is just much too expensive compared to the new kids on the market. For instance, the \u201cnext generation\u201d Haliade-X windmill prototype set a new world record a few days ago, with over 262 MWh of clean energy in 24h. That\u2019s enough to power 30.000 households.\n\nThis sort of 100% clean energy can be \u201cstored\u201d in (\u201cGreen\u201d) hydrogen, to be used at leisure, whenever and wherever it is needed. In fact, it turns out it is possible to create hydrogen with floating windmill platforms. It is clear what kind of opportunities this may provide for the shipping industry as an alternative to crude oil, which is currently the source of all of the CO\u2082 and air pollution emissions from this sector that is being complained about all over the world.\n\nAnother element that may give us some hope is the simple observation that a large and efficiency-driven organisation like an international port may in fact be better equipped to deal with such massive changes in direction. Whereas industries like (road based) mobility and agriculture may be decentralised and - to a degree - subservient to consumption behaviour, this is less true for ports. As \u201ccustodians assigned by the state\u201d, port authorities may be in a better position to look at evidence-based science, at current economic drivers or social pressure and to act directly upon any pressing conclusions. It\u2019s a counter-example to the idea commonly heard with environmental activists in the \u201ctransition movement\u201d, where decentralisation is looked at as strictly positive.\n\n**The process**\n\nThe Port of Antwerp is a fairly recent example of an organisation that has started to acknowledge the risks of climate change and has started making efforts towards adjusting its role accordingly. Its CEO Jacques Vandermeiren even committed to carbon neutrality in 2050 at the 'UN Climate Action Summit\u2019 in New York in september.\n\nHow can environmental organisations even talk to (industrial) ports? Wouldn\u2019t their interests diverge too much to even allow for a debate? It is our experience in Antwerp that this is simply not the case. But it requires a fundamental shift in understanding from \u201cboth sides of the issue\u201d.\n\nAt the Valencia Deep Dive event, many of the dynamics between the different participants were extremely recognisable from the way we\u2019ve experienced it so far in Antwerp. An initial reluctance, or even mistrust between activists, governmental workers and companies that slowly starts shifting once people start putting their concerns and ideas on the same table.\n\nThe reason for this is that we are simply not on different sides of the climate change debate, not really. Any fact-driven organisation will come to the same conclusion: climate change is real, caused by human behaviour and will have devastating consequences if left to evolve unchecked. While you may still find some disheartening (and, yes, extremely problematic) opposition to these facts within some parts of the petrochemical industries, we found out during the past year that this is not the case with the port itself, nor its shipping industries. And our experience in Valencia only served to confirm this idea.\n\nFrom close reading interviews with different \u201ccaptains of industry\u201d, it becomes quite easy to find allies for the environmental movement. In the Antwerp case, a back-and-forth debate in the newspapers on several topics like (financial) climate risk, quickly strengthened the idea that it was time to start a conversation. However, that sort of pressure isn\u2019t even strictly necessary anymore: Valencia was driven by Edgeryders and Climate-KIC and did not need a debate in the media to generate a sufficiently large sense of urgency.\n\nOnce people are willing to meet in a room, things can start to go a bit differently. It becomes possible to \u201cdeep dive\u201d into it. My contention here is that the behaviour of participants in event is driven more by the process than vice versa. So, a contentious and confrontational process will cause contentious and confrontational behaviour. To avoid this trap, during the first conversation in Antwerp, we started early on by modelling our interactions like a diplomatic process (as opposed to e.g. a debate or a negotiation). Perhaps you can think of it like encountering new cultures for the first time: Would you immediately start pointing to \u201ctheir\u201d problems? Would you immediately start to make demands or attempt to trade? That would be a bad idea, no? When it is unclear what the intentions of the \u201cother side\u201d truly are, a slow and deliberately diplomatic approach is simply the most effective way to get anywhere.\n\nA wonderful starter, that - probably not coincidentally - was used in Valencia as well, is to have organisations from all sides of the issue present an update on their most recent and most ambitious efforts to tackle the issue at hand. What you\u2019ll notice is that there is often a surprisingly large knowledge gap on all sides of the table. Since the focus of environmental organisations is quite different from government agencies and companies, this will often lead to solutions and observations that might be very widely spread out but not necessarily incompatible. As William Gibson famously put it: \u201cThe future is already here, it\u2019s just not evenly distributed.\u201d\n\nA fairly unique thing StRaten-Generaal did in Antwerp, was to expand our team with someone with high-level experience in diplomatic processes. When we mentioned this to the other environmental organisations, there was quite some initial resistance: \u201cWhy is this necessary? We\u2019ve dealt/negotiated with governmental organisations before.\u201d However, there is a strong case to be made that this may simply be an example of the Dunning-Kruger effect in action: Simply put, it is almost impossible to estimate how good or bad you are at diplomacy if you\u2019ve never come into contact with truly high-level diplomacy. To admit this is to move forward. Bringing someone with diplomatic or similar credentials also shows that you are \u201cwilling to deal\u201d.\n\nAnother suggestion is to try out a more formal process. Spoiler: It can go much better than you\u2019d expect. There are most likely a few key factors that are instrumental in making this work. One is creating a \u201csafe space\u201d for conversation. This sounds like a clich\u00e9 perhaps, but in reality it simply means no splashy press releases, no recordings of the conversations and generally the agreement that everyone should be able to speak freely, without the fear of negative consequences afterwards. This is especially true for governmental employees. And yes, environmental organisations may have more issues with this and may even experience some backlash from their supporters, but this is the type of trade-offs that are absolutely necessary to even get to a worthwhile conversation. The transition to more vulnerable and worthwhile conversations can only happen when people are willing to look each other in the eye and are able to slowly show vulnerability.\n\nA crucial factor is to invite the right people at the right moment. Governmental organisations, experts, NGO\u2019s, (large) commercial companies, lobby groups, politicians, unions, even investors are all actors that have a stake in this topic. However, if you simply throw everyone into a conference room, you will just get a massive goat rodeo. In our opinion it works best if the \u201ccore\u201d of the process is formed by governmental and environmental organisations. Of course, they will talk to other actors during this first phase, and this is fine. Equally important is to communicate the intention to involve the other actors more formally further down the road. However, you need a general framework that everyone can agree to \u201cstep into\u201d first, which cannot be developed with too many conflicting interests (and, often a long and difficult history).\n\n It\u2019s important to keep the process focused on learning from each other and figuring out where our common points of view are, rather than to look for the biggest disputes. Surprisingly, this takes quite some getting used to as well, for the simple reason that \u201cdebate\u201d that involves climate issues has systematically been polarised in the party-political and media space. Once you take away this dynamic, it can be truly shocking to find out how many things you actually agree upon and how much information has simply not been shared across the board yet. \n\nLastly, processes that try to \u201cfix everything, immediately\u201d are doomed to fail as well. So, even though you need to generally agree upon principles (a \u201cframework\u201d of sorts) early on, what should really be discussed and negotiated is the long-term process. How will you continue to work together? What kind of challenges will you tackle together? How often will you meet and who will you invite? How will you solve the financial aspects? A diplomatic process is very often much more about the \u201cway of working\u201d than anything else.\n\nPerhaps this is the only part of the Valencia Deep Dive event that could have gone a bit better. We did in fact manage to squeeze out a few follow-ups, but this was more despite the process constraints than as a result of it. However, it is always a challenge. Since there is almost no experience to build upon with this specific topic and in combination with these types of actors, it may be necessary to acknowledge that it will not be a speedy process. Lack of time and funding to spend on the process is often the first hurdle for everyone to solve.\n\n**The future**\n\nThis style of thinking and the processes that come from it are not new to StRaten-Generaal. The first time we started implementing this was within a multi-billion mobility project (\u201cOosterweelverbinding\u201d) that had been experiencing a societal and political \u201cstand-still\u201d for 10 years. After such a long conflict (and without any practical experience), it took a long time to find a way of cooperating. But many of the processes that were first implemented there are slowly introduced in other complex topics as well and are now - hopefully - finding their way into the climate debate.\n\nIs it going to work out? Only time will tell. However, we are incredibly excited about the progress we are seeing \u201cin the field\u201d. We are having conversations that very few people thought possible a year ago. This was already happening with organisations around Antwerp, but now with organisations from Cyprus, Athens and Valencia as well. And sure, it may still fail and it definitely will never be \u201cperfect\u201d, but we\u2019re picking up a shovel.\n\nIn the face of catastrophe, it may seem foolish to have hope and it may feel unbearable to be pessimistic. But we perhaps we can simply have courage.\n\n*Supported by:*\n\n![EIT-Climate-KIC-EU-flag|690x254](upload://fsdKpqMpGPFDTcZgx338atkSh0Y.jpeg)", "created_at": "2019-12-19 18:21:54.479641", "updated_at": "2020-01-22 16:24:46.521858", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2814, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 67.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33740, "user_id": 3295, "topic_id": 6589, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The situation for Armenia\u2019s visually impaired has, in many ways, worsened, since the collapse of the USSR. Despite attempts at isolating people with disabilities, Soviet principles of equality inspired policies aiming to turn them into productive members societies as much as possible. They could thus benefit from some level of state assistance. This situation changed, as lack of funding, and general stigma against human imperfection, (ironically also inherited from the Soviets) have made it increasingly difficult for people with disabilities to reach their full potential.\n\nGeneral apathy coupled with a lack of political will to tackle some of the issues related to people with disabilities, particularly, the visually impaired. This has lead to the rise of civil society organisations aiming to address these problems head-on on their own. Aside from some NGOs which have been fighting for the rights of the disabled, private sector solutions have also begun to take shape.\n\nAmong those is the Seeing Hands massage studio. Seeing Hands came about as the result of my previous work with an NGO for the visually impaired, where I learned about all the challenges, socio-economic problems, and stigma that the beneficiaries faced. Through my work with an NGO for the visually impaired, I found that there are 6,000 blind people in Armenia, and only about 20-25 of them were permanently employed.\n\nUpon doing some research, i discovered a Soviet-era plan to train the visually impaired as therapeutic masseurs and built upon that Idea. Enlisting the help of my friend Liana Avetian, a trained and certified clinical masseuse, we began to train some willing pioneers. The basic concept was a massage studio that capitalises on the heightened tactile sense afforded by visually impaired citizens while creating respectable jobs by training and employing them as masseurs.\n\nWe also received initial support from UNDP Armenia\u2019s Kolba Labs to open our Massage Studio \u201cSeeing Hands\u201d, in a new location.\n\nThough challenging at first, Avetian found that students were fast learners; to compensate for the loss of sight, their other senses were enhanced. \u201cThe receptors in their fingers are very much developed, their hands are like their eyes, It\u2019s perfect for them, but the biggest problem is that sometimes they\u2019re not trusting you easily - because if you don\u2019t see, you will not trust.\"\n\n'The organisation is, on one hand, a studio that provides high-quality massages for patrons, and on the other (seeing) hand, it's an opportunity for a too-often marginalised demographic to get access to jobs, training, and empowerment.\n\nSeeing Hands also took advantage of Armenia\u2019s recent tech boom, which now employs thousands of IT professionals. This creates a new demographic of well paid middle-class people who spend their days hunched in front of a computer and often developing back pain. This allows us to train more masseurs to meet such a demand.

There are messages that do not make logical sense and a narrative that is constantly perpetuated about \"climate change\". There are a few terminologies that are interchangeably used, yet need to be clear about their meaning. Climate change, is the seasons and weather patterns. Weather is temperature, rain, wind. Global warming, is referred to as a result from the Greehouse Effect.\n\nSo overall, the on-going mainstream narrative is \"human activity of CO2 emissions causes increased heating from the greenhouse effect\". This is the major negative phenomenon narrative. That by the global warming is increasing by 2C, or 3C, that the climate will change, in other words, weather patters will change. (Really, humans are God like, that Co2 emissions cause weather patterns to change?)\n\nFor readers who need to refresh their understanding about how the Greenhouse Effect works than here is the information&gt;\n\n- https://www.learner.org/courses/envsci/unit/text.php?unit=2&amp;secNum=3\n\nBack to the point of my post, how certain sentences are worded, and which perpetuate the narrative about climate change, in sentences such as\n\n*_\"We need to reallocate our best resources to climate-proofing humanity.'_*\n\nLogically, this is not possible, without climate there is no humanity, so what is this nonsense message?\n\nTo then *_\"addressing climate change through innovation by achieving deep decarbonization across cities\"._*\n\nKeep in mind that CO2 is also a natural gas, and without it we cannot live, because we are dependent on plants photosynthesis of C02.\n\nFurther to address this paragraph,\n\n*_\"all past prosperity has been built on the destruction of nature, too many people are unable to see a future for themselves in a post-carbon world, and stall the necessary change. We need to respond by controlling the narrative. But, a winning narrative requires solid cultural underpinning. That is why we are engineering [a collaboration between science fiction authots and economists ](/t/8534) to imagine completely different economic systems\"._*\n\nDo not wrap the wool over people's eyes here, the hole has been dug deep enough. So, to address this paragraph, the aim is to live in a non-carbon world (?), which is impossible. Or to stall carbon output (?), which is also nonsense as carbon is always being produced and required for human, animal and plant life. So, yes, people cannot see a future in a post-carbon world because it's absolute nonsense.\n\nFurther, to design new economic systems with the collaboration of science fiction authors and economists. There are already a lot of alternative economic based system that have been trialed, and are in use in small communities around the world. If the aim of the project/s is to actually invent an economic system with the collaboration of science fiction authors and economists and put this into physical, practical actions than it'll be quite something. How about involving children, as their imaginations are ripe and fruitful? Main point is, their minds are not brainwashed with CO2 global warming narratives, so they can actually brainstorm ideas about new economic systems.\n\nI am all for innovation, as it is crucial for humanity to seek innovative theories and put them into action, yet it doesn't need to be equated with \"controlling CO2 emissions\". The narrative can simply be to engage independent/like-minded group thought for humanity to positively increase quality of life. The Earth has a way of dealing with access gases, thus it's very important to portray a narrative which communicates green-innovation, clearly and well.\n\nSo, how about to promote innovation in green-energy engineering, innovation in green infrastructure/architecture? Which has been done and is being done. To promote independent thought outside the box to mainstream narratives. As with a lot of mainstream narratives, not only in earth sciences, trends are sensationalised, which requires research funding - and guess what \"global warming\" requires research funding. Hence, IPCC and it's whole existence. The narrative is over-sensationalised and dramatised to some dooms-day scenario. Plus, confusion with what and how weather, climate, and sphere/s processes work on Earth. How the sun, and oceans play a massive role in maintaining stable temperatures on Earth.\n\nSo, to truly utilise ones energy in projects and create tangible change for quality of life on Earth, I suggest expanding it in an area where one's actions will be utilised for a worth while and well-intended cause. Where one understands the basis of the project. Climate cannot be precisely predicted, it's a fact, scientific results will always be uncertain in relation to climate, because climate/ weather is an uncertain phenomenon. There can only be estimates, which are not certain. Further, I can see that the responses to my post/s will only be bias and I can already see that the intention is to control the \"global warming\" mainstream narrative. For those that are interested I found two interesting academic articles to challenge the global warming mainstream narrative.\n\nhttps://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/99EO00132\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_Wynne/publication/249726325_Strange_Weather_Again/links/54aedd130cf29661a3d3aef6.pdf", "created_at": "2019-08-17 17:09:49.469530", "updated_at": "2019-08-17 17:09:49.469530", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 868, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 9.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68621, "user_id": 4683, "topic_id": 12388, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Hello John - here my comments.\n\n* How new is your phone? - end 2019 (Android), replacing a four year old one (Windows) because support to App-based social media is phase out; \n* Do you use it for everything? - no, screen & keyboards are far to small; the phone is too intrusive \n* Do you use Alexa or other similar device?  - no\n* Do you have smart home appliances and gadgets? - nearly none, depending on what counts\n* Do you have a late model automobile? - 3 years old, ready to purchase a E-car that reach local market this year\n* Do all your files live on the cloud? - no, purposefully only partial synchronising across different machines; use of different clouds & local storage\n* How extensive is your online networking? - hmmm; just pulling an 18-person co-authors group together for a book; I know 'in vivo' three co-authors and met two other once.\n* Do you restrict what you say? - hmmm; I tune wording to media and expected (less-known) audience; my guide rule: What ever I would say to a friend being in a crowed bus I would say 'online'.\n\nCurious what you make up of the above.\nbest regards & happy 2020 :wink:\nMartin", "created_at": "2020-01-12 18:13:40.370367", "updated_at": "2020-01-14 00:48:04.385016", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 197, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60042, "user_id": 4945, "topic_id": 10866, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I would have to agree with Alex in the case of the UK.

He wants to work more closely with Edgeryders in driving forward his work on digital identity in the context of NGI Forward.\n\nThe main conclusion of the meeting was this. Rob has a story in three steps. \n* At step one, some relatively familiar, even boring, stuff happens. Companies form consortia to roll out digital ID solutions (like [it's me](https://www.itsme.be/en/) in Belgium); obscure standards bodies make resolutions; national governments and the European Commission fund technology development. \n* At step three, the Westphalian world as we know it is over. States die by a thousand cuts as people stop paying taxes. A completely new world emerges.\n\nStep two is missing. It's true, identity certification is a key element of statecraft, and giving it away to the ilk of ING, Proximus and Microsoft seems a counterintuitive move. But the mechanism that leads from an inoffensive new login system to a full system breakdown, that's not clear at all. \n\nWe are going to help in filling in step 2. We do it in two ways:\n\n* We move back in time, and talk to historians. There are definitely historical precedents from what's going on. When coinage was invented, it was about transforming a piece of metal into some kind of magic word that carried the might of the sovereign. Today, in a similar way, the Estonian government assigns a unique number to each chip embedded in e-ID cards. Both the king's profile on the coins minted by Isaac Newton as Master of the Mint in the 17th century and Estonia's unique codes are fairly easy to fake, and were faked. The system maintained then, as I guess it does now, its balance based on a mix of general goodwill (most people do not cheat most of the time) and violence (the king's goons). Maybe there is something to be learned by looking at these precedents.\n* And we also move forward in time. The Sci-Fi Economics Lab (#earthos:sci-fi-economics) is building up a library of fictional economies that might help us imagine the world that's coming. Is it a post-Westphalian world of clades and franchises, like in Neal Stephenson's *The Diamond Age*? Is it a world of international truth-establishing bureaucracies like Information in Malka Older's *Centenal Cycle*?\n\nWe do all this both on and off platform, but Edgeryders, as always, lives mostly on platform. I am asking @johncoate and @MariaEuler to work with Rob on community management. We also might want to roll out a dynamic page on identity (pacing @owen). Maybe we, in time, spin off a new sub-cat of #ioh, dedicated to identity.  \n\nRob and Ga\u00eblle will move forward with an open call for some essays to be somehow rewarded, both in history and in sci-fi. We republish it and circulate it. They might also organize events where the best stories get showcased. In general, they drive the work, but we support them from here. \n\nRob, am I misrepresenting you?", "created_at": "2020-01-21 18:23:48.566630", "updated_at": "2020-01-22 08:27:15.465021", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 521, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 243.2, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915, 4934, 8, 4096, 5, 5538, 3622, 6308], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69919, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 12598, "post_number": 8, "raw": "I just added an edit that was in the other discussion, and for some reason did not make it here: \n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:1, topic:12598\"]\nIn a way, we have citizen engagement exactly backwards. **It is not the citizens that should engage in regional policies.

There were Welsh speakers in the room who were angry that there wasn't MORE Welsh speaking happening on all of the panels. They weren't concerned with being mistranslated by the professional, they were concerned with not being able to speak Welsh in Wales. I imagine this can be a frustration for other language speakers who are forced to work in Euro English, but in a country that within our lifetimes has had to legislate to ensure that the language didn't die out completely, it is understandable that they want to hold on to that. I remember back at OpenVillage Festival we had a number of French speakers in the room, but we had no official mechanism for dealing with translation. This meant it was incumbent on a few French/English speakers to do the translation on their behalf. But if you're translating then you're not completely engaged in what is happening in the room. I merely thought that by offering a professional element to this it could free all participants up to fully engage. Yes it's awkward, but its also much more inclusive.\nI'm a little confused by the bit about 'dress code', because there wasn't one at all.\n\nI think i completely disagree with you about the idea that 'rural arts' is unexciting, and that we're better off looking at the cities. Perhaps i failed to communicate much of the content and the challenges wrapped up in working within the non-urban setting. I was trying to precis some of the content and the connections that i made while i was there, rather than a full account of the whole festival. \n[quote=\"alex_levene, post:1, topic:9066\"]\nHis view is very much that rural areas are now the front line for transformations of our societies, given that they are tied so intrinsically into our food/nature/ecosystems.\n[/quote]\nThe full argument, (which working within this setting i can follow) is that it is much harder to engage audiences and artists within rural settings because the normal mechanisms of the urban environment don't work. Rather than imposing high art, or the idea of 'what is worthy' as decided by people in urban centres the work must be built from the ground up. Exploring the stories that affect the people who live in those areas, and how it is often the rural locations that share the global issues rather than the cities. Rural areas are generally the ones who will feel the brunt of global warming, migration, economic depression and the winds of political change much more strongly than the cities, which all deal with their problems in the same way. But (to use an example from one of the case studies) all pig farmers across Northern Europe were affected the same way by the Financial crash and the growth of the Chinese market for grain. Grain prices went up to feed pigs, but meat prices remained low. This affected everyone, from the small independent to the large conglomerate. And ultimately there were people on the ground doing those jobs who never felt like they were being listened to by anyone. \n\nI think it will also be interesting in the coming ramp up to POPREBEL to consider the fact that the areas across Europe overwhelmingly drawn to populist narratives are rural areas, which means that we may be seeing a large influx of views and input from those communities. To dismiss the rural viewpoint, and to point instead to the power, prestige and importance of the cities is to court the same disaster that has brought us to where we are now with populism. That is the cry of the populist after all, \"they aren't listening to you, you don't matter\".\n\nWith regards the official article and the scene in Wales/UK around funding, 2 notes. \n1 - this is just a drop in to this particular area. The next sessions will be in Germany and Palestine. What we will learn there will be palpably different to what we can learn of the arts scene in the UK.\n2 - if this were to turn into a conversation about why arts and cultural funding in the UK is horrendously unhealthy and incredibly difficult it would be a whole other article, one that i imagine few people on the platform would have little relish in reading. But it is what it is, and given the numerous factors in play there's nothing that can be done to wholesale refresh that system whilst the entire country is simultaneously having a nervous breakdown and a catatonic episode. What else is left for us in the arts? Most of us do what we do because we cannot conceive of doing anything else. We bend and break and twist the rules we have been given to make them work, but ultimately right now if you want funding you have to play ball.\nThis is austerity economics, coupled with conservative small state idealism, coupled with a drive to discredit and bankrupt local authorities (usually in service to party political ends) The idea was that there would be a corresponding rise in philanthropic giving to fill the gap (similar to the US arts funding system) but guess what, that still hasn't happened. And given the UK is basically Europe's offshore money laundering arm (and heading further in that direction) i don't see there being a sudden spike in philanthropy any time soon.\n\nTo answer your main question though, [quote=\"alberto, post:2, topic:9066\"]\nis a scene where we can find strong, funny, resilient, sarcastic idealists to do cool stuff with?\n[/quote]\nAbsolutely. The majority of people at the conference would fall into those categories. Perhaps their idealism is differently aligned, but ultimately they want to make work that investigates the human condition. That challenges, inspires and entertains. They want to speak for the disenfranchised, they want to challenge the comfortable and they want people to go back to their homes feeling a little bit better about their lives.\n\nIt will be interesting to see the difference between this one and the Munich session which will be much bigger. I also hope that there will be more than 1 of us there so that there is a chance for 2 reports to come out. Perhaps that will better encapsulate the experience.", "created_at": "2018-09-27 12:05:47.112682", "updated_at": "2018-09-27 12:05:47.112682", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1085, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [47600], "is_reply_to": [47600, 47610], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49280, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9277, "post_number": 5, "raw": "I thought it was quite interesting - a lot of good ideas.

You would see safe playgrounds built, or new green meeting spaces, or social, communal activities. A flagship project of the Trojan Lab non-profit, it went on for 4 years now, involving more than 25 streets, but as an experiment, it also had an expiration date: the end of 2017. An experiment as it was, its eyes were always on the prize: exploring a new approach of public space, finding alternatives for street parking and reworking people\u2019s relationship with city officials.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/51a2696a189975fad3fecd054d04ef13ce34cbf6.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\nThe story begins with the city administration itself: in 2011 it was part of a <a href=\"http://www.themusicproject.eu\">European program</a>\u00a0about the transition to a climate neutral city. The result was that we should rethink the mobility system in order to become climate neutral. Beginning of 2012, the city of Ghent started a transition arena. Pieter was one of the 20 people involved in this arena, as he used to work for the National Railway Company and involved in sustainable mobility development. These 20 people were brought together, and\u00a0had the opportunity to be critical on the current system but also had the power of imagining a future vision, how it could be better.\n\nIn this process, after six months, the arena developed a transition agenda for sustainable mobility in Ghent, where a couple of critical choices were identified,\u00a0that needed to be made to achieve that vision. \u201cHard choices\u201d they called them: two of them were the basis for the Living Street project. So:\n\n1) The arena had the vision\n\n2)\u00a0They determined some critical hard choices, policy making decisions\n\n3)\u00a0At that point the arena had developed about 10 ideas for how this can be put in practice. Living Streets was one of these ideas.\n\nPieter: \u201cAfter 6 months we pitched these ideas and while the city\u2019s work was done at the time, we didn\u2019t feel we were done. I will always remember that night. These 20 people sat in a bar and said \u201chow can we make our ideas real\u201d. That\u2019s how it all started.\u201d\n\nThe group didn\u2019t have a status at the time, they weren\u2019t the government neither a NGO. It was just a group of people that went on and organized in 2013 the first Living Streets in 2 streets. The city of Ghent helped by giving the permission to experiment with a new kind of street.\n\nPieter: \u201cWe evaluated it with the city administration and wanted to carry on. We needed a legal status for two reasons: first, to be legally covered when things go wrong, and be able to protect ourselves and the project. A second is that we were starting to work with money, we had private sponsors and companies saying they were interested in what we are trying to discover. We organized an NGO, very close to the city organisation, because we wanted to change the system.\u201d\n\nThe mission of that NGO (The Trojan Lab) was - within the timeframe of 5 years, and importantly, in between 2 elections - organizing as many as possible experiments and gather lessons, see what dynamics all this can start. We\u2019ll stop before the elections to make sure that every political group has the possibility to take the lessons and translate them into the government system.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Where the project is today</h3>\n\nThe Living Street experiment has 3 strategic goals:\n\n1) How can we evolve from street park to neighborhood parking?\n\n2)\u00a0How can we turn grey streets to more lively/colorful streets?\n\n3)\u00a0If we create spaces on street level where people can meet each other and come together in a peaceful way, will this strengthen social cohesion in the neighborhood?\n\nEvaluation was in-built, it had to do with the process of arriving at a Living Street.\n\nPieter: \u201cWe started engaging people with the question \u201cWhat if?\u201d; mapping the ideas and also the interests of people. \u201cHow do I look at my neighborhood?\u201d from the perspective of social security, traffic, safety, more green in the streets,... For each remark we mobilize our network and creativity to support initiators from each street to find solutions. After that process is done, the people come up with a vision for their living street, that will be implemented in practice. Evaluation is an ongoing process, so things can be changed during it.\u201d\n\nThe project is driven by the communities in the city. The Trojan Lab started the mapping and year after year new people were interested to help and lead the process, or involve others. The quality check was always done by the organization.\n\nPieter: \u201cIn terms of social cohesion, it\u2019s crystal clear after 51 Living Street-processes in Ghent, we created a new space at street level that improves relations between residents, between the city government and his residents and we discovered innovative solutions to redesign the street and park the car at a neighborhood parking.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">What next?</h3>\n\nThe Trojan Lab and the volunteers from the Living streets are now helping the local government to think about and rethink how Living Streets would look like without the role of the Trojan Lab. What\u2019s in it for the city administration: it involves bringing different public stakeholders together with those who have participated from the streets, to think how it can continue in the upcoming years.

I finally got around to reading [Schaffer's paper](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1jMT_AWmcW3Y-abHHNQEFCnrRg0_vVaoP) as you recommended. I have the feeling I shall be quoting it for a long time. @amelia, if you did not know it already, please read it as soon as you can, it has immediate implications for what we do. @sander, you too please, as I would like this to be part of Skunkworks-1's references. \n\nSchaffer has a very solid case against surveys, even those with open-ended questions. He uses evidence from the [Global Barometer Project](https://www.globalbarometer.net/) and his own study to pinpoint the problems that surveys suffer from. He calls them compression, compartmentalization and homogenization (framing bias is not mentioned). \n\n**Compression** has to do with long- vs. short form responses.  It is compounded by problems with interviewers pasting standard phrases to summarize what the surveyed folks are saying. This is already solved by SSNA as it is, because (1) the conversational form in which data are generated has abundant space, and will record whatever key informants write. On top of that, (2) the semantic network visualization allows to immediately see how key concepts connect across the informants' posts. \n\n> Most people that we interviewed juggled multiple standards [for what it is meant by \"democracy\"]. This woman seems to have two particular standards in mind \u2013 freedom of expression and low prices \u2013 and applies each of these standards at different moments in the interview (p.10).\n\nI can practically see `freedom of expression` connected to `low prices` on Graphryder. :smile: Later in the paper (p.14):\n\n> The more generalized point is that the kind of multi-dimensional thinking evidenced by the fish vendor, shop keeper, and custodian is not likely to be captured in the short-answer, compressed format of the Global Barometer surveys. The informative messiness of how people actually understand _demokrasya_ is replaced in the surveys by concise, single-idea, easy-to-write- down-in-a-few-word answers. Complexity, ambivalence, and interconnectedness are displaced in favor of the short, simple, and telegraphic.\n\nAmen to that.\n\n **Compartmentalization** arises when you try to mitigate the compression problem by giving people more than one answer to the same question (\"What else?\"). In that case, what gets lost is the link between the main concepts carried by the different answers. This is also supported in SSNA as it is. In fact, it seems as if this were the *main* problem that SSNA was designed to address. Schaffer's complaint is spot on:\n\n>  [Global Barometer researchers] code each of the individual\u2019s responses as if they were free-floating and disconnected from each other\n\nHe goes on to claim that responses are interconnected, and they should be treated as one. SSNA's conversational medium keeps track of what is said in what context, and so has native support for this kind of analysis. \n\n**Homogenization** has to do with how you treat responses in different languages. Starting on page 23, the paper takes a deep dive into the nuances of the Tagalog word *kalaayan*, translated roughly as \"freedom\". But the translation is simply too rough, as are those of the words that, in other Filipino languages, are understood by researchers to mean \"freedom\". Money quote: \n\n> We see, then, that _kalayaan_ has a distinct history that apparently reverberates to this day, a history not shared by its rough equivalents in either English or in other indigenous Philippine languages. Yet survey researchers have homogenized the meanings of all these words. Freedom and _kalayaan_ are treated as twins, while any possible occurrences of _kagawasan, wayawaya, kahilwayan_, or _katalingkasan_ or other similar terms were hidden by reporting all the results in English or Tagalog.\n\nSSNA has not, so far had native support for this stuff. But with POPREBEL, it will acquire it. Implications for @amelia is to keep those open codebooks lively, and make sure to talk etymology across the team. \n\nAll in all, a very very inspiring read.

Generate the data\n\nI export data directly from Discourse. They go into four files: \n\n* `users` (social network nodes)\n* `posts` (social network edges)\n* `annotations` \n* `codes`\n\nLogic: a simple API call to the topic already gets the username of the author of the post that each post is a reply to. So, this maps very simply and reliably onto a \"list of nodes and links\" representation of a social network.\n\nAnnotations and codes are not arranged in network form, although annotations do preserve the IDs of the posts that they annotate, and those of the codes they are annotated with. I think arranging the codes in a graph might be too limiting: after all, almost no ethnographer outside of Edgeryders thinks in networks.\n\nFiles are saved in CSV, rather than JSON, format, for reasons explained below.\n\n### 2. Pseudonymize \n\nSee [above](/t/12645/1).\n\n### 3. Add the metadata\n\nOKFN maintains a nifty [Python library](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-py) that creates Data Package-compliant metadata from a batch of data files:\n\n```\nimport datapackage\npackage = datapackage.Package()\npackage.infer('**/*.csv')\npackage.descriptor\n```\n\nHowever, the library does not work on JSON data, only on \"flat\" tabular data \u2013 which seems to be the new standard anyway, according to OKFN's [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/) project.

While it was initially met with some postive feedback, nothing came out of it. I suppose there are many possible explanations for why but these are my own:\n\nPriorities. Loomio is tech-focused, ouishare\u00a0is focused on one theme and the focus is their big annual event a.f.a.i.k. Edgeryders is \u00a0focused on what the individual wishes to do, rather than the tools with which to do it, or how it is (if at all)\u00a0related to any particular topic/theme/objective etc.\u00a0\n\nRules of engagement and how things get done: Edgeryders strives to be a do-ocracy\u00a0and \"who does the work, calls the shots\" etc. This is different from a consensus-based decision making culture where it is important that everyone is \"heard\".\u00a0\n\nTools. E.g. The last time I checked Ouishare was largely facebook-based, \u00a0whereas this is the<a href=\"/t/build-your-own-home-why-the-user-experience-on-the-edgeryders-website-is-worse-than-on-the-commercial-cloud-and-why-thats-good/2404\"> Edgeryders ethos</a> on the matter. Loomio\u00a0develops and uses it's home grown tools for deliberation and decision making. Edgerydere develops and uses it's own tools for collective intelligence (using ethnography and network analysis). Perhaps we may end up using some of their tools, but once a culture within a community (including use of tools) is set, it's very costly to change...\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-02 10:45:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:18.814946", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 292, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 40.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [200, 4795], "is_private": false}, {"id": 72885, "user_id": 3782, "topic_id": 10644, "post_number": 17, "raw": "cool,,thank you!", "created_at": "2020-03-30 10:49:53.468507", "updated_at": "2020-03-30 10:49:53.468507", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [72884], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47269, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 8500, "post_number": 15, "raw": "@ericasmar and @AdnaneA!

Different reasons for doing it, different tools used. I think the trend rightnow to calls all of that into one class and oppose it with (essential) worker's who can not work from home even if they and their company wanted it is presenting a wrong picture and conflict. Yes, right now there is a big different in the live of people who's work can be done remotely and that of those whose can not, but there are many more different factors within those groups. And yes, currently many of those rely on tools provided by big companies, but those are not the only way to sustain this type of work as Alberto pointed out. And if the need for a tool exists and the flexibility to start using it, initiatives come u to develop it. Many of those end up being bought up and incorporated or simply copied in the current set up, which is where those sizeable cests come back in.

Additional resources](#heading--5)**\n\n------\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. Background</h2>\n\nedgeryders.eu is intended as a collective intelligence engine. Most conversations are part of one or more participatory processes, and are aggregated to produce a result. In other words, we almost always do some kind of research with Edgeryders material. This implies taking very seriously the issue of research ethics. In this topic, we document the different ways we acquire from participants to our conversations their informed consent to their content being used for research.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Consent on the forum: The consent funnel</h2>\n\nThe so-called \"consent funnel\" is our default method of gathering informed consent from users for content they post on the edgeryders.eu forum. Here is how it works:\n\nTo post on edgeryders.eu, people need to create an account. The first time they open the editor to post from that account, the forum serves them a simple questionnaire to inform them of the website's research purposes, and make sure they understand how to use it. Currently, the form looks like this:\n\n![Screenshot1|690x554](upload://fJbTwbqRIS8alrgjpsmQqBXTdiP.png) \n\nAs long as users provide wrong answers (for example, if they reply that they would gladly share their credit card number, or not protect their identity properly when worrying about consequences of posting their content), the questionnaire \"stalls\", preventing the user from posting until he or she gets the response right:\n\n![Screenshot2|550x690](upload://qGK6sxYXlI7rUiSY89fvbD2KqgW.png) \n\nOnce the user provides the right answers, the website records that he or she has consented to participating in research and understands what that means. The date of completion of questionnaire is stored in the edgeryders.eu database.\n\nUpon retrieval for data processing (for example, ethnographic coding or [SSNA](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1059029), only the content associated to users who have completed the process is served. This is necessary because some content was created before we put this process in place.\n\nThe text of the questions, answers and feedback is maintained [in our Github repository](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/blob/stable/plugins/discourse-edgeryders/assets/javascripts/discourse/templates/connectors/composer-open/consent.hbs). This is also the place to make necessary changes: edit the file, commit and ask @matthias to test and deploy the new version.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Consent on the forum: Auxiliary methods</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Physical events</h3>\n\nThe process used for physical events, based on the [workshop on Inequalities in the age of AI](/t/10326), works like this:\n\n1. In the opening of the event, inform participants that notes will be taken, and they will be used for research. Introduce the research in question.\n\n\n2. People are still encouraged to post on the platform; if they do, the consent funnel applies as usual.\n\nThis method is privacy-aware, but does not lead to well-formed social semantic networks because the identities of individual speakers are lost.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Posting on edgeryders.eu before signup through an online form</h3>\n\nWe have created two feeder websites. register.edgeryders.eu elicits reflections pertaining to our projects in the form of a registration to a physical event. listen.edgeryders.eu is a facility for reporting the results of listening triads during events. Both feeder websites contain questions pertaining to the research, and elicit one piece of structured data, the informant's email address. Both contain a tick box next to a statement that the person filling the form understands that the content will be used for research. The statement uses the same wording as the consent funnel. If the box is not ticked, submission of content and email address is impossible.\n\nUpon submitting the form, edgeryders.eu creates a new account associated to the email address in question; marks this new account as having successfully completed the ethical funnel; and posts the answers to the question in the form of a new topic, whose authorship is attributed to the newly created account.  \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. One-on-one interviews</h3>\n\nFor one-on-one interviews, two methods have been used. One is a more or less standard informed consent process.\n\n[quote=\"natalia_skoczylas, post:3, topic:11908, full:true\"]\nRegarding the interviews in person, indeed, whenever I ask someone to tell me their story, I first inform them that this text will be used as part of the research, and it will be available on an open platform, and the person can get access to it and delete it, if they want to, at any point. I also stress the possibility of staying anonymous, so that they can disclose as much as they feel comfortable with.\n\nAnd at the end, when the talk is transcribed, I would send it to the person for a review - with a deadline - to make sure everything is done correctly.\n[/quote]\n\nTODO: Link a resource with available evidence (email threads?).\n\nThe second method re-uses the idea of questions that the interviewee must answer, and proposes the same questions that the consent funnel does, only in paper form.\n\n[quote=\"noemi, post:5, topic:11908\"]\nExample: for the 2 interviews Tamara did in Serbia where she created accounts for people and posted their stories, we printed out the [consent form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jF64XYYtwgcn73HvQbzgdzRZcf6cr0sXwYd0lfqu64Y/edit) and they signed it.\n[/quote]\n\nTODO: Collect the signed form and link to a resource where they can be found.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-4\">3.4. Interviewee posting her own interview</h3>\n\nThis process was [prototyped by @hugi at Internetdagarna](/t/11906/2) and works as follows:\n\n1. You need an installation of the [edgeryders-form](https://github.com/edgeryders/edgeryders-form) software, with the form configured with the questions you want to ask the interviewees.\n\n2. At the beginning of the interview, explain that at its end they would be asked to provide a username and e-mail address and that an account would be created for them at edgeryders.eu with that information and their transcribed answers would be posted under that account. Explain that they would get a confirmation email and that they could log in and update or delete the post at any time, and that they can also participate in the conversation as they please.\n\n3. Transcribe their answers as well as possible during the interview. That means entering their answers into the form software while sitting next to them or across from them. You can ask follow-up questions to dig deeper before moving on.\n\n4. At the last page of the form software, ask them to choose a username and provide an e-mail address. Explain that the e-mail address will not be made public and will only be available to staff members. Also explain that they can choose a username that makes them anonymous if they so please.\n\n5. Asked the participant to carefully read the consent text, and then to *check the consent box themselves and press the send button*. The consent text should be as follows (here in English only, but potentially also translated):\n\n    > \"I understand that submitting this form will create an account for me on edgeryders.eu, and that my responses will be posted by that account. I understand that I can log in at any time and update my answer or continue the conversation with other participants. I understand that this form is used for community driven research. Researchers are encouraged to treat your answers as a window into societal, economic, technological, and political trends and transformations that affect us.\"\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Consent for recording community calls</h2>\n\nSome people ask us to post audio recordings of community calls. We recommend not to do this, as doing this ethically is quite tricky. Much better to post written accounts, authored by a specific individual (normally a community manager), and viewed through the lens of their subjectivity. Additionally, community calls are meant to encourage casual sociality, and we have found that people are more reluctant to socialize if they know there are permanent records of their interaction.\n\nIf you still decide to go ahead and do it, you need to make sure that people give their consent *before* the call, ideally in writing. This is because consent is not supposed to be sprung on people: they need to have time to consider whether to give it or not. In a group setting, there is the additional issue that an individual might feel pressured to say yes if everyone else has said yes. When you start the call, begin by confirming that everyone is still OK with the consent they have given. If someone comes on the call that has not given consent, you are then supposed to stop recording. \n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5.

But you can do the same transformation that Discourse does to calculate the final URL for `img` tags from the `upload://` URL. I'll show how it works with one example:\n\nLet's say we have the following upload URL and a corresponding so-called \"cooked\" URL:\n\n```text\nupload://w6Q793RK3Xl2Tjw1IoVXzmv3X00.jpeg\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e10b857825d31d2c8479e246704de45ff241da44.jpeg\n```\n\nThe cooked URL contains the hostname, directory `uploads/default/original/2X`, then a directory with one letter conforming to the first letter of the image filename, and then the image file basename, and the original file extension. The non-obvious part is to create the image filename. This is done by interpreting the basename of the upload URL `w6Q793RK3Xl2Tjw1IoVXzmv3X00` as a Base62 number with character set `0-9` , `a-z` , `A-Z` and convert it to a Base16 number.\n\nDiscourse uses the `base62-rb` gem library for this purpose, and I just tried that conversion successfully as follows in IRB (an interactive Ruby shell):\n\n```ruby\n$ gem install base62-rb\n$ irb\nirb(main):001:0> require 'base62-rb'\n=> true\nirb(main):004:0> Base62.decode(\"w6Q793RK3Xl2Tjw1IoVXzmv3X00\").to_s(16)\n=> \"e10b857825d31d2c8479e246704de45ff241da44\"\n```\n\nSo your task would be to do the same in JavaScript. For reference, the place where Discourse itself does this is `models/upload.rb` line 277:\n\nhttps://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/39b2fb8649bb7c1956bc915d824878ad133d648f/app/models/upload.rb#L277", "created_at": "2020-10-03 22:06:28.231055", "updated_at": "2020-10-03 22:07:59.080435", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 285, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 26.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [84145], "is_reply_to": [84145], "is_liked_by": [3622], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35373, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 6892, "post_number": 3, "raw": "It sounds like a good plan.

I'd like that. :blush:\n\nLike Jasen said, desiccants are great to prevent dampness and mould when storing a wide variety of things in a cellar.\n\nI had similar issues in the truck when not being there for several weeks or even months in winter, and now find a great (and cheap) solution: excessive amounts of calcium chloride (example: [10 kg for 18 EUR](https://www.ebay.de/itm/254435574506)). This material is the most frequently used agent in the non-electric room dehumidifiers. \n\nThey sell also dehumidifiers for these 1 kg fabric bags, but no need for these (and they are way too expensive for what they do). I'd just use a large enough bucket at the bottom to catch the solution and a plastic or stainless steel kitchen colander places at its top, with the bag in there. So all water it captures will just run into the bucket, and from there can be emptied into the drain. By using a bucket that is large enough, you don't have to worry that it might overflow while in use; one kilogram calcium chloride will grab up to 7 l of water out of the air over time.\n\nBy using excessive amounts of large enough dehumidifier buckets distributed in the room, the room will keep dry for a year or longer.\n\n**Caveats:** success depends on the type of cellar. If it's a small room with a tightly closing door, that's perfect. If the whole cellar is one large open space, it will be difficult to keep that dry by any means. In that case, I'd put sensitive items into airtight boxes, together with silicium dioxide as dehumidifier. That other type of dehumidifier stays completely solid when attracting water, so does not endanger anything in the box by producing some sort of solution.", "created_at": "2020-08-14 18:38:30.255822", "updated_at": "2020-08-14 18:38:30.255822", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 317, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 25.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [81748], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76830, "user_id": 4869, "topic_id": 13564, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Thanks Alberto for reading the piece and the thoughtful comments!\n\nI think the bit about me now praising Big Tech is perhaps a bit of a accidental \"selective editing\" from the text- as it was meant more as a sarcastic bit about how they've now so entrenched their power that they are better able to uphold the kinds of infrastructures that we now rely on- not that we necessarily need to use Big Tech always, or that no alternatives exist. The problem is that alternatives like Jitsi can now not (yet) meaningfully compete because of the underlying conditions that have made the Big Tech so powerful. This is no way me praising Big Tech for providing us with services- it is challenging the laziness of the \"end of the techlash\" narrative! Later on I also say that I hope this might just give us the impetus to more permanently transition to open source alternatives etc. - it's just that the conditions *currently* aren't there, and that many have been too complacent to switch. \n\nRegarding working from home: Of course working from home was possible before- the point was more that it is a privilege to work in a jobs that can be done remotely- most particularly lower-paid jobs don't allow for this (i.e. manual work, many segments of the service economy, etc.). Jobs that can be made meaningfully made to done remotely disproportionately require university degrees, etc. \n\nIt is not the only facet of discussions about class of course, and there are also those in lower-paid jobs who can work from home and vice versa, but the current crisis has revealed and accelerated a growing divide (discussed in far more detail further down in the blog) that we need to be wary off.

I will take a look at the book, it sounds interesting and might help me understand these points a bit more.  \n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:2, topic:10041\"]\nAt different points in time, the same activity was considered to produce value or not, depending on the ideology of the time.\n[/quote]\n\nA question I'd have whilst reading it is how do \"ideologies of the time\" get set?  I'm going to assume predominantly through advertising, media and political events in current times - which are all generally encoded with capitalist values - making people want certain things and then things being designed to meet what people want. That feels cyclic and I wonder if the book suggests how to disrupt it?\n\nI once got into an debate with a doctor at Microsoft (Ireland) who during it warned me I was \"thinking pseudo-philosophical thoughts\" about the value to the world of our work there and how we were conducting business with others.  I left there pretty quickly after that but I've been considering this question now for over 20 years - what value to the world does my work-effort/life contribute towards? I'm avoiding the depths or heights of the meta and keeping it as practical as possible and have worked for those organisations (BBC, UK Civil Service) where I assumed I'd find aligned values.  Although good work has been done, I'm still searching.\n\nWhat I haven't done much of is think about other people's value theories and _how_ they are embodied within the technology. I like your question:\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:2, topic:10041\"]\nWe might hold heterodox value theories, and many here do. Me, I am very interested in how such theories are encoded into technological artifacts. What are your views here?\n[/quote]\n\nI have thought about your question all morning now and talked myself around quite a few twists and turns and sometimes they've put a different meaning to your question...  An overly simple answer is that I think it has to be by design and through compromise.    I go back to my view of it also being cyclic and a need to break that cycle somehow.  A chicken and egg situation - analogous to capitalism and people.  Did the people want the consumer goods or was it the consumer goods that made the people want them?\n\nI've a photo here I took at a service station a couple of years ago:\n\n![FB_IMG_1559558429355|690x388](upload://rgwZaRNiQhv10zGdFiOrO33FPSQ.jpeg) \n\nThis was a busy weekend in summer along a major motorway in the UK.  What struck me here was the first fast food place, [tossed](https://tosseduk.com/our-food/),  had menu was very different to that which is expected of the motorway fast food chain.  Personally I dread the service station and only really pop in for the toilets but this place actually had food I would eat.  Sure there was still a bit of plastic and convenience but generally the food options were healthy and appetising (to me) and had been ethically sourced.\n\nThe reason I took the photo is probably obvious to most of us here.  Why was this more healthy and more ethical fast food place not more popular?  It looked funky, pink is hard to miss, it was the first and most prominent food place as you entered the building, it had a big sign and the food on display looked good.  Yet it was empty, and I was the only customer there for a good while.  \n\nThe neighbouring options were packed.  The burgers and chicken places had queues that backed up quite some way.  I really did find this difficult to understand - my own value system programmed to avoid those places - So I posted the photo on social media asking others what they made of it.\n\nThe main answer I received: _It's what the people want._\n\nBut I'm not so sure. I'm under the impression it's more like: it's what the people are told they want.\n\nThey probably wanted something: tasty, quick and cheap to satisfy their hunger and they could have got that from the first place just as much as anywhere else.  So what else was it that the people wanted?\n\nDid they _really_ want: the grease dripping down their chins clogging up their arteries, eating animals that have been intensively reared in inhumane conditions, paying companies that encroach on natural habitats and cultures, who avoid tax and litter the countryside and seas with their rubbish?\n\nI'm sure if they were asked directly they'd say no.\n\nSo I just don't understand the influences and value theories at play here but feel it must be due to the people being misguided/told/sold an idea in some way...\n\nAnother example:  If somebody had said just a few years ago:\n\n> I'm going to bug people's houses with listening devices for my own commercial (and political) gain and what's more they're going to PAY me to do it! haha!\n\nWe would have laughed.  But apparently the people want to ask what the weather is, to be told a joke, to have a voice from thin air in their house respond to their questions and consumer needs.  The implications which when logically argued surely outweigh the benefits so what value theories are at play here and how are they formed - within the technology/product and/or within the people.\n\nI would really be keen to explore this more - can you tell me more about your specific interest in encoding value theories into technological artefacts?\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:2, topic:10041\"]\nYou say you want to build \u201can attractive and scalable product that could be readily adopted by society and easily incorporated into peoples lives\u201d. This also what normal-capitalist tech companies want.\n[/quote]\n\nWhat I am suggesting here is that we need to tap into this psychology in some way.  We need to be able to use the capitalist approach of telling people what they want but based on our more heterodox value systems that benefit humanity.  [I wrote about this here where I use successful quaker businesses such as the UK chocolate industry as examples of how it might be done](https://medium.com/@tom.a.broughton/my-hot-chocolate-sweet-spot-c5875bbfe118).\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:2, topic:10041\"]\nI imagine your product will be different, and I mean *technically* different, as it embodies a different world view. But in what way?\n[/quote]\n\nThis is where I come to what I consider the 2 biggest threats to humanity. 1) the environment, 2) our intolerance for each other.  And the question - what technologies can help here?  I think it's about 1) downsizing so we can do more with less for longer and 2) altering value systems by moving people away from valuing personal instant gratification and competition with our neighbours to more rooted longer-term purpose and meaning through being valued and needed by our neighbours for our complimenting skills.  \n\nMaybe this is along the lines of eco-villages and the technologies that can enhance and support those principles - maybe it is to start to identify opportunities to weave those kind of principles into society as it currently stands rather than create a new eco-village environments from scratch. \n\nI could start listing out things but I'd rather find a group to work on this with in a structured way.  \n\nMaybe, if this chimes with your own interests Alberto we could work on it together in some way?  You're the only one to respond to my post so thank you - I wonder in light of this conversation if others would be interested to join in on this thinking too?\n\nAlso, if you or anyone knows of other projects or work that is looking at this maybe you could point me to it and I would be very happy to join in there too.", "created_at": "2019-06-03 12:55:07.362269", "updated_at": "2019-06-03 12:55:07.362269", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1335, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 38.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [54353], "is_reply_to": [54353], "is_liked_by": [5139], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62434, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 11283, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@nadia @alberto @ilaria @noemi please add your comments and edit the text where necessary so we can push this out this week ahead of the sci-fi event.

Something that makes a day for the reader/user. Things that are suprising, engaging and if possible, in attractive form. An interview will sometimes do, but it needs to add value visualizations, photos, etc. The key is that there has to be someone who actively looks for such content and has an eye for a good story and is capable of editing.\u00a0\n\n3) From the moment we have the additional content, it should also be boosted with additional marketing budget to engage audiences around social media. It is the fact that FB is built so that additional boosts are rather vital there for example.\u00a0\n\n4) I do not think that metrics should be too complicated in themselves.

I started to document in Tunis, made 2 experiment with 2 handcrafters in Tunisia then I noticed that it is the same situation in Africa, but it is misrepresented, as a lot of people think of Africa as one country or one  homogeneous place and have no idea on the different constituents. \n\nwith TANDA is **diversity in tamazigh language**,I aim to preserve and modernize the African Handicraft Culture heritage.\n\nBy doing 2-3 month impressive experience where 2 designers, a videographer and a historian divided in 2 phases.\n\n1. one is coliving where the handicrafters share their know how and history of the discipline they are working in  basically the TANDA team will do some observation to gather the data.\n2. then go to the codesign phase , where all of us joining forces and cowork and co design products; mostly furniture and recreational products that will be purchasable in any place that want to have an African theme, showcased on a web-platform as a digital museum and a digital archive.\n\n\nOne of the things that I have noticed, is after these experiences is that the designer is the one who gets all the economic benefits and fame, and we want to give attributions and benefits to the actual handicrafter, so the product will have either their names as a brand or will see another way for doing this. \n\nand all the data will be purchasable in MOOCs or toys or video games to make Africans and all the people around the world to know about their heritage through an alternative educational model. \n\nThat's TANDA for now. \n\nwhat I was doing this period of time, is to start the project seriously in Tunisia , either starting as an organization or as a firm, but the thing is with the startup act and all the things around it, it will only be applicable in 2019 , I was doing the work individually with the same women that I know from the GIZ experience.\n\nthey work in weaving techniques in general and I got all to know the symbols and patterns, \u2026.now trying to produce 3 independent product with these women, It is all about me going to spend some days in Gafsa to make it work, it is getting kinda heavy on my pocket but I am catching up with doing some works in UX UI design\n\n## Q & A\n\n**1-  hazem : Do you have a map of handicraft in Africa, which regions are known for which art, how are you going to map and track this ?**\n\nI have the map of the ancient African empires. \n\nMy 1st approach was to track the actual countries of Africa; Nigeria Ghana , Benin...etc  but with colonization and if you want the track heritage u need to track the ethnic groups in Africa \nwhat happened that all the homogeneous ethnic groups were divided and that's how the new composition of Africa is done \n\nexample: the Nuk empire, now the region is between Benin and Nigeria , they used to be one homophones mostly known for bronze and gold casting techniques , in 2017 they actually  got one big statue  of their kings from Britain.\n\nI wanna make it in a more optimized way, just tracking the original ethnic groups, as they have the social collective that's were the  true knowledge is. \n\n\n**2- hazem : How to Represent the  knowledge you already have from Gafsa ?**\n\nAt first we are making 3 rugs- The women are , Zeina, Tashria and Dahbia  meaning the beautiful one, the wise one, and the golden one \u2013 after we realize the product showcase them in the Tunisian international handcraft show, and from that we will work on getting positive feedback and the help from the office to showcase them in international handcraft shows like the ones in Milan, Frankfurt and [a City in the US \u2013 please add ]  and will see what happens from now on. \n\n**3-Shajara:  when the project catch up and you a have showcase , how to be financially stable ?**\n\nProducts will be mostly furniture and recreational ones , will try to target people in hotels restaurants, discos , luxury houses, hostels,  any big space that needs a very creative interior design work and convince them with our product and if they are gonna purchase as it is a big space, so it will be big like 15 rug per space or so. \n\nwill give the handcrafts per royalties and will build up from that, that that will be the prototype to catch investors and funders to have more financial capabilities to upscale\n\nthe 2 designers will be fresh graduate designers, it is from experience as fresh graduate they get shocked in the market as the things we learned doesn't fit the market , so it is something that they get knowledge and get to work in the domain as well, \n\n**4- Shajara : on MOOCs what pedagogy and how are you building it in a way to be replicated ?** \n\nsince I am working on UX UI design it requires a lot of work , one product could require 4- 6 months of work. \nIt depends on what the target would be primary schools or scholars themselves or teenagers , it requires a lot of work to get fine results.\n\nwhen I collect the data from Tunisia there are 4 major regions, I then begin to work on the transfiguration of all that data. \n\nIt is also related to money , when we get the financial help we need, I can work on transfiguration of  data on the same time. \n\n**5- shajara: do u know other projects working on the same in Africa ? as there are the same situation in Asia and Latin America as well** \n\ndon't know about handicrafts, but I know there are a lot in the general cultural heritage and monuments but not focused on the handcrafts heritage. \n\nThere is some tiny projects collaborations between designers and handircafters, like one designer go to Senegal or Benin for some time and then gets the credits of the product without mentioning the story behind the product. \n\n**6- Matthias : about target markets  I like the idea of targeting hotels u want to do this in the same country or want to export as well to countries were there is a good exchange rate ?**\n\nI got this idea of making a hostel or a lodge house that will be decorated with all the products that we collected form a certain space in Tunisia so it will be a space were the products showcased and decorated the place, but I don't know how it could be financialy feasible.\n\nThat's why I got to go for hotels and restaurants.\n\nbut the optimal is whenever we finish In a region the final product are showcased in the digital archive and a place were people can get a tangible feeling of the project itself. \n\n\n**7- shajara : what are your  needs  right now ?**\n\nbasically I gathered 2 fellow designers that believe in the cause I have a video editor as well  but still don't have a historian, as I need a creditability that will convenience a historian to join in this journey , as in Tunisia there is not a large no of historians that focus on handicrafts,  not in a detailed way. \n\nThe Tunisian office of handicraft has some data collected over the years, still in paper, a great part of it is in really a bad shape, it is a lot of bureaucratic work  and paper work to let me get to the data and I am sure they wouldn't let me in. \n\nI need financial boost. To be able to pay the handicrafteres, I have a decent handicrafters network in Tunisia but I can't make them engage with me in a work based on false promises or promises that I  will not be able to keep, ethicaly and to be working effectively that's what I need the most.\n\n## Group discussion\n\n[ please add what you see missing  ]\n\n**how much money are we taking about ?**\n\nsofien: Just for the start. Would be around 5k Euro just to make  an immersive experience and pay the handicrafters and pay the video editor  and the historian. The designers are going to get knowledge and produce products.....but also to have the space to showcase the products for a longer term.\n\n\n\n**matthias : So may be that's a minimal case for getting an investor in the early stages, as they can have a share from the final product, and then the 5k is not a problem that could be done via crowdfunding.**\n\nshajara : crowdfunding , start before producing products so it is safe for handicrafters and give tangible products like jewelery for crowfunders. ( already Sofien produced some jewelery parts based on an old technique but didn't work as a good hook to attract investors for the rugs or other handicrafts )\n\nsofien : I have noticed different kickstarter campaings, to make people purchase products before manufacturing u need to make a fancy video with good 3d visualization. I have never done a campaign before and one other element is crowd funding is not legal but it is ok we can get the moeny via an account abroad, but may be this is the most accessible method.\n\nIslem : crowd funding is not allowed in Tunisia. \nSofien :  it is feasible by making an account abroad and make the connection from there, it is not legal from Tunisia in Tunisia but via abroad account it is feasible.\n\nmatthias : U could run the crowd funding campaign via edgeryders,  were you sell the products to edgeryders in this case it is legally ok. \n\n**sofien : I am into this idea. Ok we can start doing this on the platform** \n\nI will figure out a way to get the money and start working on the design and production of the 6 rugs ( 3 in Tunisia and 3 for abroad ) and may be I can figure out a way how to implement these rugs with some furniture. And that's a good start. \n\nNext step to know **how much do u need for the 1st iteration** for the rugs and based on that u can set the no of earrings that you have....working on the math, on how much products you can make and how many you can produce and timing of the delivery. \n\n I have been applying as well  to many mentoring competitions and grants and idea pitching contests around the MENA and African region and I am still waiting from some responses, finger crossed if I am lucky enough to get accepted to get the project going on steadier foot.", "created_at": "2018-09-03 10:48:51.281738", "updated_at": "2018-09-06 11:35:03.231436", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2085, "wiki": true, "reads": 20, "score": 159.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4267, 3782, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53379, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9881, "post_number": 5, "raw": "[quote=\"erik_lonroth, post:1, topic:9881\"]\nI seek a few people that would like to arrange a joint workshop in teaching our community fundamentals in Free &amp; Open Source.

Governance is tricky, because one of the key interests (data holders) is so fragmented. By this I mean not only that there are many data holders, but that our individual contribution to the data economy is small, order of magnitude of, what? ~ 100 EUR per person per year? I would barely sign up for a scheme that returned to me ~20 EUR per year as a fair reward for contributing my data (OK, I would totally sign up, but for political reasons, and I am a data geek). I would definitely want to invest zero time in making it more share so that I can get 21 EUR instead (if internal democracy is super effective). \n\nTo give you an idea, I am a member of the Italian main collecting society for music copyright monies.

It should work (and I think that's what [crossorigin.me](https://crossorigin.me/) does, but I did not check). But it's a hack :slightly_frowning_face: \u2026 so let's see if we can find something better \u2026\n\n[quote=\"gdpelican, post:14, topic:11022\"]Modifying the Discourse source code to allow Api-Key creds to come in via CORS[/quote]\n\nThat would be the clean solution, right? I rarely disagree with the Discourse people on their software design decisions, but here I do disagree. The point of CORS is to protect the _user_ from requests made by malicious sites that trigger actions on their behalf. Now the user is still protected if a Discourse site admin had to explicitly whitelist a site (that uses Admin API keys) via the \"cors origins\" setting because the Discourse site admin can check what that site does with the API key that is entered. And there are other legit reasons why a user might enter their own API key into a third-party website, beyond the edge case that we have here. For example a tool for API testing, or for data extraction etc..\n\nMaybe we can persuade the Discourse devs and get this change into upstream. Otherwise we'd have to maintain it in our fork. In that case: not pretty, but clean.\n\nNow our in-house Discourse developer is literally beyond the reach of the Internet for the next weeks, trekking around Annapurna. So, in the interest of progress: Would you want to try implementing this? For additional money of course. If so, please propose us a budget, or if that sounds a bit risky for this task, then first propose a budget for code exploration so you'd know the required effort better.\n\nI'd install the code when ready.

Mainly, it's due to three primary reasons:\n\n1. No one taught us how to present.\n2. We don't have to study our presentations since we would put the entire content in the slides makes it dull \n3. Having all the materials organized in slides can help grant something physical at the end of our presentation.\n\nThen, he preceded the first exercise as introducing your projects in a sentence that doesn\u2019t exceed 140 characters.\n\nNext, he displayed the first main interest, which is **the audience**.\n\nIt\u2019s the people/cluster to whom you would be presenting and pitching. It needs to be inquired by asking the following questions to create \u201c **An audience map** \u201d:\n\n* Why are they here, or why would they read the handout? What motivates them?\n* What are their problems? (Considering the presentation theme or his personal and professional life)\n* What are their passions? What interests them?\n* Is there something that they cannot stand?\n* What are their expectations?\n* Do they have some bias that I have to face immediately?\n* What do I want them to do at the end of my presentation?\n\nThe answer to the first question represents the \" **Goal of your presentation** .\"\n\nIn fact, there are two types of presentations:\n\n* Informative presentation: its role is to transfer direct messages\n* Persuasive presentation: it aims to move the audience and motivate them to act upon a particular matter.\n\nIt is also essential to clarify the subject of your presentation, called the \" **Focus** ,\" the main interest of the audience, that is highlighting the problem they want to solve.\n\nThat is how you will guarantee your audience's attention.\n\nAs for the structure of the presentation, you ought to follow the following process:\n\n1. Opening: to attract the audience's attention\n2. Exposing the problem\n3. Presenting a solution\n4. List of advantages\n5. Wrap up + Call to Action\n\nAfterward, a video of Steve Jobs\u2019s presentation, [\u201cIntroducing iPhone at MacWorld 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qPAY9JqE4),\u201d was screened to illustrate the structure of his pitch. \n\n**The handout design process:**\n\n* It would be best if you start by writing all of the content in a word file; it saves time.\n* Conceive a simple slide with empty slides, images, and no bullet points.\n* Make sure to dedicate one slide for each concept\n* Avoid using typical tacky images to demonstrate your point.\n\nIn conclusion, make sure to remember:\n\n1. You are presenting for an audience, your key-player, try to understand who they are!\n\n2. Define what you want from your audience and make an explicit call to action at the end of the presentation.\n\n3. If you want your audience's attention, involve them and find their problem, that's the starting point to convince them of your solution.\n\n4. Slides (in a live presentation) must be simple!\n5. Handout and live presentation are different communication processes, they work differently, and they need different approaches.\n![image|689x690](upload://gWiLe5EsQcjFOLkpwg1IUWJO9No.jpeg)", "created_at": "2020-02-21 21:13:25.275243", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 13:25:36.771095", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 724, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 123.6, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6048, 8, 3703, 347, 5547, 3875], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80513, "user_id": 104, "topic_id": 14092, "post_number": 5, "raw": "thanks @alberto.

As for the price issue - if environmental or resource protection is one of the motivations it can depend on a lot of details how big the bottom line effect is. So ideally that could help motivate people more if they can clearly understand this in the grander scheme of things. Unfortunately this is often difficult to do - and it can also be depressing (not good for sales). :(\n\nWith most electronics however this usually is a very good argument. Especially since the last couple of new gadgets (e.g. iphone) did not really get any better anymore...\n\nAs for the dilemma of needing recycling facilities: how are the chances to partner up with an official recycling company. Then you can say they will do the recycling, while you pick up certain bits out of the resource stream which you can use for a greener bottom line. The fact that in reality you are physically separate and really only pick up what you'll use yourself in the first place perhaps has no effect on the law. Plus, you could talk with the recycling company and see if there may be something that you can really do that is mutually beneficial?\n\nI think it probably is a good idea to establish an informed and logistically coordinated re-use layer that exists between wealthy consumer/\"tier 1\" business and (thermal) recycling facilities. I'd love to think a little more about a concept in this direction.

Introduction</h2>\n\nSome day @anu and I want to open a small roastery company in Nepal, and for that we eventually need a roaster. Below, we evaluate suitable models we can buy or modify or build. If we were to buy one in Nepal, it would be the Top Grains Intl. 5 kg LPG fired roaster, imported from the manufacturer in India. If we were to build one, we'd build our own, fully automated, open source coffee roaster with 1-2 kg batch capacity \u2013 a draft design for this is included below.\n\nHowever, we're not actively building or buying a roaster at the moment \u2013 for the start, there are enough roasters in Kathmandu with spare capacity who agreed to roast for us as a service.\n\nAnyway, this is an open source project, and anyone is welcome to contribute to the roaster's design and to the knowledge collection below. (For that, this very post is a \"wiki\", and after a few non-spam contributions a new user automatically gets the permissions to edit it.)\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Small commercial coffee roasters</h2>\n\nRoughly ordered by suitability for a small roastery in south Asia \u2013 the most adequate ones first. Contains both models that are ready to use, models that would have to be modified for commervial operation, and models that offer design inspirations for own creations. With a focus on suppliers in India and China, but also including suitable (i.e. relatively cheap) models from around the world.\n\n<table>\n\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Model</th>\n<th>Roasting Capacity</th>\n<th>Heating Options</th>\n<th>Price</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.topgraininternational.com/coffee-roasters.html#coffee-seed-roasting-machine\">Top Grains International Alfa Coffee Roaster</a></td>\n<td>5 kg</td>\n<td>gas<br/>\nelectric</td>\n<td>185,000&nbsp;INR<br/>\n(2400&nbsp;EUR)</td>\n<td>4.5 kW heating.

The proper title is \"cyclonic dust collector\", and they are widely used for all kinds of air cleaning purposes. Note that those attached to coffee roasters normally don't have the motor shown here, as the coffee roaster itself will have the motor integrated. However, integrating the motor here instead could make sense if routing the air first through a cooler, as it would allow a much simpler fan that does not have to be heat-resistant.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Draft Design for an open source roaster</h2>\n\nBased on the above research, I came up with the following draft design for a simple, gas powered 2 kg roaster with automatic operation (means, automated filling and pouring).\n\n* Should be a 350 g - 2 kg roaster that is fully automated, using temperature probes and software to control emptying and filling and roasting. This way, the roaster can be small (350 g - 2000 g capacity). This way it can be cheap, allowing to scale the operation by using multiple ones in parallel. Just as with all other machines, technology can be much smaller, so much cheaper, when it does not need human attention and can run on its own. Because then, wage costs are of no concern. The same applies to roasters. Calculations: \n\n    *  If the roaster has 350 g batches (the typical \"sample roaster\"), it can process in terms of green coffee beans: 350 g / 18 min = 1.17 kg/h or 28 kg/d or 196 kg/week or 9.97 t/year.\n    *  If the roaster has 700 g batches (\"double samples\"), it can process in terms of green coffee beans: 700 g / 18 min or 2.34 kg/h or 56 kg/d or 392 kg/week or 19.94 t/year.\n    * If the roaster has 1500 g batches, it can process in terms of green coffee beans: 1500 g / 18 min or 5.0 kg/h or 120 kg/d or 840 kg/week or 42.7 t/year.\n\n* For redundancy, it would make sense to use two smaller automated roasters instead of one twice as large (e.g. two 350 g roasters vs. one 700 g roaster). Given that the service of roasting may be charged at 1 EUR/kg, the small 250 g machine could earn up to 10950 EUR per year (minus energy costs). Which would already be a complete business in some countries.\n\n* For energy efficiency, the roaster would be very well insulated, and heat in the exhaust gases would be re-used through a heat exchanger that heats up incoming air.\nThe roaster should have a packaging machine in addition, and be installed at  the sales location. It would \"notice\" how much is sold (taken away from the output queue) and produce only as much as needed to have around 6 packages in stock. This way, customers would always get the most fresh coffee possible.\n\n* Should be LPG heated, based on a normal off-the-shelf gas stove, either the size for normal household kitchen use or a bit larger (\"Hockerkocher\").\n\n* Should be made from a stainless steel (or normal steel) drum, with the electric motors and all other electric components operating on 12 V DC input for safety. A normal AC adapter of a desktop PC can be used for power conversion. 12 V electrical motors can be used from car parts, so are widely available.\n\n* Should be mostly built from simple metal parts (sheet metal, tube, square profile \u2026) and otherwise only 3D printed parts. The advantage here is that 3D printing is available at least in the capitals of all developing countries. CNC milled parts from plastic or aluminium, and molded metal parts from aluminium are also possible.\n\n* Needs an innovative mechanism for fully automatic loading and unloading.\n\n    * Proposal: a drum with only one open end and the gas burner attached near the drum, similar to [this roaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPkR34WxeM0). Adding to that a tube as long as the roaster and on the opposite of the pivot. It will position close below the input funnel while allowing the roaster drum to pivot 360\u00b0. Three positions are used: vertical for filling, pointing 45\u00b0 downwards for pouring, horizontal or pointing slightly upwards for roasting.\n\n    * Proposal: the drum should be cylindrical, with one funnel attached at each end. The one at the pivoting end to pour, the other one to fill. The outside diameter of the funnel would be the same as that of the drum in both cases. The drum will turn to vertical around one end automatically (with a counterweight for simple movement) to pour the roasted beans, then close the lower end and pour in new beans from the top. While resting in roasting position, a suction hose will draw in any smoke and chaff from the pouring end, and run it through a chaff collector and exhaust. A great real-life example of this design is this [small Chinese shop roaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1mL5iHJ7Nk); also [this DIY roaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF2eb8hpmFc) is similar.\n\n* The smoke would be pulled through glass wool as a smoke filter and then through 30 parallel copper pipes in a large water bath. This allows to re-use the exhaust heat for water heating, and to use a household vacuum cleaner as suction device.\n\n* Or even better, we don't filter the smoke but burn it together with the LPG that powers the roaster, like a rocket stove. This prevents most of the air pollution otherwise created by the roaster. Any chaff contained in the smoke would also be burned, so no need for a chaff collector either. To extract the smoke, it seems better to push in air than to pull it out, as no heat-resistant fan is needed then.\n\n* There would be no blower mechanism for cooling the beans, instead they would be poured on a piece of sheet metal with many holes in it, in such a way that they distribute over a large area. They can then cool in open air. The reason for active cooling in commercial roasters is usually that they are operated indoors, so the smoke has to be extracted. Also because 5-50 kg of beans per batch will be many layers of beans, needing stirring to be cooled. These are no issues for the roaster here, which will be operated outdoors and only produce 1-2 kg of beans per batch that can be easily cooled in a single layer.\n\n* Even simpler alternative for cooling: Instead of cooling the beans fast using active cooling or spreading them into a single layer, we will simply calculate the additional heat of slower cooling into the roasting time and stop the roasting earlier. We can simply switch off the gas supply and rotate the drum until the beans are cool. Then pour them directly into a storage container. Since operation is fully automated with this roaster, the longer cooldown period and the inability to roast in parallel to that does not matter at all. With this setup, the drum should be made from light stainless steel sheet metal material, to not waste much heat on the repeated cooling and heating.\n\n* Should be controlled by a Raspberry Pi. The Pi would run [Artisan Roasterscope](https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.com/) itself, and would be controlled with a touchscreen.\n\n* A sheet metal sleeve in 1 cm distance around the rotating drum should be used, and insulation around that, similar to the pot sleeves. It will increase energy efficiency by 30-50%. When pouring the beans out, the sleeve will be lifted, too. It will not rotate with the drum though, and have a large hole at the bottom for the hot air of the stove. There can also be air guides to distribute the hot air from the stove evenly to all parts of the drum.\n\n* If a chaff filter is needed, it should include an automatically operating one. Not of the vortex type particle filter because these devices are very large, but a perforated stainless steel sheet as a filter, with an automatic brush to clean it from time to time.\n\n* The whole machine should be small, fitting into a pallet compatible box with a 40\u00d760 cm \"Eurobox\" footprint. The box should be possible to be shipped as a parcel and as checked baggage during air travel. It should be light enough to carry by one person, allowing to quickly set up the roaster outdoors for operation. By operating it outdoors (for example on a flat rooftop or under a protective roof in a garden area), smoke extraction devices become completely unnecessary.\n\n* The machine should include a funnel large enough for either 30 kg or 60 kg of green coffee beans (one half or one \"bag of coffee\", the usual unit of packaging and accounting for green coffee beans; see [The Coffee Exporter's Guide](http://www.falconcoffees.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Coffee-exporters-guide-2012.pdf), p. 16). 60 kg at 1.5 kg per batch would allow for 40 roasts, taking about 13 hours. 30 kg would take 6.5 hours \u2013 enough to fill one full shift of a worker when also considering setup time and cleaning. The funnel can for example consist of the upper part of the box (all five sides except the bottom) which is turned around and placed on top of the roaster that was inside the box. The bag that contained the green beans can then be placed below the roaster (assuming it has some kind of extensible legs) so the roasted beans can pour into it.\n\n* To always use the same batch size, there would be a vibrating hopper or a small conveyor below the funnel, pouring the beans into an intermediate vessel on digital scales. This also automatically serves as the valve to start and stop the flow from the funnel. It might be simpler to connect the digital scales directly to the roasting drum, with a suitable counterweight for the vessel mass if otherwise exceeding the scales capacity.\n\n* Should be made from just a few types of simple materials. Just stainless steel sheet metal, and steel square tube for the frame. The frame material would allow some options, including T-slot aluminium profiles. Also all electrical parts (motors, microcontroller etc.) have to be of a generic type and easy to obtain. Control electronics should be configurable to be adaptable to slightly different parts (e.g.adjust rpm speed of motors etc.).\n\n* A 1.5 - 2 kg automatic roaster seems to be adequate for a small roastery. A 2 kg roaster can roast at least 8 kg per hour, so 80 kg in a 10 hour day. It has to be observed for fire safety, but that is easily achievable with even one person (with \"work / life integration\"). 80 kg per day, sold at 2 USD/kg profit, is certainly enough for 1-2 workers in most countries. Also, the roasting time can easily be extended to 16 hours a day in two shifts, resulting in roasting 128 kg per day, resulting in 100 - 105 kg roasted beans.\n\n* It should be possible to produce this machine in Kathmandu. Means, if welding stainless steel is not readily possible, it should be bolted or riveted.", "created_at": "2017-11-18 00:58:22.507910", "updated_at": "2019-04-09 11:40:38.462312", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4917, "wiki": true, "reads": 29, "score": 24152.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791, 3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67999, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 12273, "post_number": 2, "raw": "", "created_at": "2019-12-29 19:02:43.756654", "updated_at": "2019-12-29 19:02:43.756654", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 8.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25066, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4417, "post_number": 26, "raw": "<b>Double pack</b>\n\nPerhaps you could do an honor system where they are asked to record one now, in return for also transcribing one of someone else.

I think it\u2019s pretty clear [from the above](/t/12063/28) that I strongly proposed YAML (or JSON) in Discourse posts for all flow of structured data from Discourse to webkit software.\n[/quote]\n\nI read your post very differently. It was phrased as \"been toying around\", and as a suggestion to Owen, not a hard requirement. Had I known that you were adamant about it, it would have been a very different story. I didn't even read it as a proposal, it sounded more like a possible idea. I also did not understand from this post that it was _instead_ of using tags, just that you proposed this as one possible way of getting structured data.\n\nIn this case, our misunderstanding stems from that you see it as much more of a problem than I do to clutter the tag namespace. Since the namespace already contains a [myriad of seldomly-used tags](https://edgeryders.eu/tags) and appears very ad-hoc, it seemed to me that this implementation would not mess with any carefully constructed order. Had it actually been the case that we already had a cleaner namespace, I might very well have made a different assessment. \n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:28, topic:12063\"]\nI\u2019d like to strongly encourage @owen to evaluate if YAML is a good data standard for the modular web kit as a whole, and if so, to use it for that.\n[/quote]\n\nFor reference, I read this strong encouragement as being about using YAML rather than JSON in the config file displayed with the webkit. Indeed, I did not understand why this was a strong encouragement, as it seemed like a minor point. Oh well, now we know.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:55, topic:12063\"]\nSo please, for the future, take this kind of change proposal seriously.\n[/quote]\n\nI will, but I have to understand a few things to be able to assess the advice, namely:\n* How strongly you feel about it and why\n* What you see the consequences would be of making the wrong choice\n\nAll of this said, I very much respect your drive to keep the platform structured. I just want to note that in this case, there was no way for me to know that you had this opinion about tags since it was not explicitly stated, nor implemented in practice.\n\nNow, turning from the meta-discussion towards making this work...\n\n------\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:55, topic:12063\"]\nTags are just a selection mechanism for topics. So by switching to another such mechanism, no need to re-do much of the implementation.\n[/quote]\n\nHere I need more information. It is true but is it also true that other selection mechanisms are as easily exposed with an endpoint as tags? On this, I would like the advice of @gdpelican.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:55, topic:12063\"]\nall topics from a category, such as \u201c[Internet of Humans \u2192 Events](/c/ioh/events)\u201d, that have a date field set using the Calendar plugin\n[/quote]\n\nThis would be good, except for that we want a single webkit site to be able to display content from many categories. \n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:55, topic:12063\"]\n* all topics tagged #event plus #project-ngi-forward\n[/quote]\n\nThis could be a way of doing it, yes. But it is a bit harder for the end-user applying tags to end up on the webkit. It means the instruction to the end-user becomes a little bit more complicated. This also requires the webkit cache plugin to support querying a set of tags, and it requires rewriting the webkit react modules to passing an array of tags. These are not hard problems, so we could do it in some cases.\n\nHowever, it becomes a bit cumbersome to always have to think about content curation from the perspective of combining Discourse tags. For example, a specific curation of articles for a slider on the webkit for a specific purpose \u2013 like showing an interesting cross-section of different Edgeryders projects. In this case, we need to be able to somehow mark these topics and the most out-of-the-box way to do that is with a tag. Of course, we could also have a hidden custom field available for all topics for moderators that would basically be like a separate set of hidden tags. Again, I would need to understand if this changes anything for how we can query for these topics, and how much work this would be to implement.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:55, topic:12063\"]\nThese are rather short session descriptions, not something that you expect Discourse users to extensively comment on. \n...\nIf you\u2019d want comments inside Discourse for this content, of course topics would be the way to go.\n[/quote]\n\nHere we have tricky impasse; some sessions would be useful to allow commenting on, to start the conversation before the session. Others are not. And if we don't use one topic per session, we also can't use the events plugin, which means that we lose access to good features like enforcing the date formatting we need to display on the front end.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:55, topic:12063\"]\nBecause: this content has to be in a public category to be accessible by the webkit, so you can\u2019t keep these topics out of people\u2019s \u201cNew\u201d and \u201cLatest\u201d lists.\n[/quote]\n\nHmm, but you can suppress a category for showing up in \"Latest\", right? I have done so [for this category](https://edgeryders.eu/c/workspaces/webcontent-sandbox), which is being used to feed content to the NGI Summit website. \n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:55, topic:12063\"]\nNo issue if you have to do the NGI Summit with the custom tagging as started now, but please try to make the transition directly after that.\n[/quote]\n\nUnderstood, we will continue as is, and also continue this conversation to find a sane way to do this that satisfies all parameters.\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:55, topic:12063\"]\nSo maybe **#ioh-featured** or **#ioh-featured-story** would do?\n[/quote]\n\nWell, yes and no... I think it might be the case that the curation for the summit will be quite different in nature than the curation we as Edgeryders care about, for example.

I am relatively green in that field but I'd have a couple of contacts I may be able to bring in/lend an ear. And like I said, especially the audio part has been a pet peeve of mine.\n\nOne could perhaps ask for a little seed money to help the Nepal team support us in making generic architecture (which would of course need to be locally adapted). I would think a very basic regional cluster covering 3-6 villages, or a more focused approach supporting a more specialized infrastructure project (which needs skilled staff for e.g. maintenance), or a health focused version would be obvious applications. If there is enough agri/eco info available one can go deeper into nutrition and sustainable agriculture for different biomes/biogeosystems.\n\nAs one would focus on the hardware, maintenance &amp; info flow architecture the cost would not be very high - especially once the wrinkles get worked out and the stuff is properly ruggedized. Then one would transition to the part where it becomes self accelerating - which is a real nice prospect. Combine this with language and culture conservation aims and it gets hard to turn down this offer. Still, the one thing that keeps me up at night is the risk that this could be subverted to less than humanitarian goals. This can be turned around though: as long as we don't have long lifetime electronics - we have an automatic containment system (important if you start doing experiments you don't really fully understand).\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-12 19:09:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:43.267156", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 306, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29339], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56745, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10361, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I read it, but am not qualified to have an opinion.", "created_at": "2019-07-15 19:32:48.006462", "updated_at": "2019-07-15 19:32:48.006462", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58385, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10552, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Indeed.

I would be involved in this and travel to tunisia to facilitate the workshop itself.\n\nPerhaps it would be good to do this within the timeframe and context of the Edgeryders Festival taking place in November 19-29.

Plus we can start onboarding people, connecting them with one another, recruit mentors etc.\n\nAnother side thought; It would be good if you could synchronise communication/outreach campaigns with @inge and @anon82932460 who are handling our communication channels (facebook, twitter, linkedin).

The focus is Collaboration (Technology) for freelancers*\n\nThe panel speakers were: [Matthew Mottola ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/matthew-mottola-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14480), [Dani Ifrim ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/dani-ifrim-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14584), [Nicole Gray ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/nicole-gray-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14536)\n\n# Collaboration over Competition\n\n [Matthew Mottola ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/matthew-mottola-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14480): **One can do it all - but that is just the start**\n\nWe started the conversation with a statement by Matthew Mottola (*Author of the book \"Human Cloud - How Today's Changemakers Use Artificial Intelligence and the Freelance Economy to Transform Work\" ( you can reach him here @matthewmottola)*) about what the big \"game changers\" in terms of freelancing technology have been up to this point. **\"Technology that enables individuals to do the work that has previously been done by whole companies\"** has enabled freelancers to run their own professional businesses without dedicated HR or accountant staff. He also pointed out tools for processing payments internationally and contract signing, which while less obvious than project management tools have had a huge impact on the development of the current freelancer economy.\nThe obvious project management tools have enabled freelancers to actually work with companies. \nMatthew sees the upcoming game-changers as tools that would enable freelancers to take on complex tasks and work together with other freelancers. \nIn regards to open source solutions, he does not think that companies/clients will ever buy into the co-ownership models that this would entail, or those solutions working at scale, but he sees the underlying ethos of open source as relevant for the development of freelancer to freelancer collaboration culture.\nHe ended up with the analysis that what would be needed next would be:\n 1. One platform for freelancers which gives them actual ownership over their information, so they are not forced to switch and stretch themselves thing across multiple platforms. This is actually what he is working on with his current project.\n2. Enabling the collaboration between multiple freelancers, going beyond this initial \"one person can do it all\" idea to one person can work with everyone.\n#\n\n[Dani Ifrim ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/dani-ifrim-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14584): **Learning what you want** \nDani Ifrim  (you can reach him here @Danifrim) addressed the realities of working as a freelancer in the creative industry. Certain tools are necessary in this field, for example from adobe creative suite, but he still sees a lot of movement in this context as the best program ends up to be the one used. In his opinion, in the creative field the biggest programmes are usually also the best, and he would wish for even better compatibility between the tools. \nDani, who is now working as a photographer and web developer, had originally an education in mechanical engineering. He stresses the amazing platforms that are available to learn skills online as you need them to develop yourself and your practice. **\"All that I learned, I learned from Youtube and Skillshare.\"**\nIn this phase, open-source programs are very relevant, but once a person professionalized they move towards the program that works best. There are a few examples, like Blender, where a developer commits both to opensource and best quality, but that is an exception. \n\n**\"Personally I feel very lucky to live in the time that I live. Maybe sometimes it is too overwhelming, but you just have to put in some work in analysing what suits you best and yes, just do it.\"** - Dani's optimistic and encouraging closing statement.\n\n#\n\n[Nicole Gray ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/nicole-gray-will-join-for-a-triad-conversation-on-freelancing-tech-resilience/14536): **Community and Communication**\nNicole Gray is the founder and facilitator of a community for freelancers. (You can contact here @bxdcomm).  She sees the main game-changer for her self and many of her community members to be \"notion\". \nThe challenge with each new piece of technology you use is the learning curve, which is why most people go to the big monopolies because they do not want to potentially sink the costs of learning a new piece of software. Personally here again she has had good experiences with the Notion, Gmail platforms and Slack, but Zoom turns out to be the most important as it enables face to face engagement.\nIn this time, a large number of people have been forced to change quickly from a tradition fulltime job into a freelance position. **\"What can help with this challenging transition can be a likeminded community.\"** She would call a good online community a tool in this sense as it is integral. She has observed that especially new freelancers enjoyed virtually coworking sessions in her community.\nFreelancers have to constantly test their messaging and communication their \"brand\" to develop.\nNicole stresses that building community is key.\n\n# \n\n### A thought experiment: \n**What would you wish into existence?**\n\n* Something solving the problem for document access, as all the tools currently are developed for company teams, not for multiple freelancers that have different levels of access. Data shows most freelancers waste half their time with admin work like requesting access.\n* A tool that merges different communication platforms like Messenger, Slack, email, Discord, WhatsApp etc. into one interface for you, collecting all the communications with each person and also allowing everyone to use the type of platform they want to use for technical or ethical reasons without having the freelancers \"communication application diet\" explode.\n* \"push a button and get working\" to share the access and tasks with everyone according to what they need to be doing, and alongside this for the system to keep a record of the skills, needs and your history with each collaborator.\n\n## Closing statement: **Collaboration over Competition**\nNicole formulated the closing statement **\"Collaboration over Competition\"** which was seconded by everyone. \nThis is a great jumping-off point to discuss the future development of freelancing and tech to enable collaboration between multiple freelancers.\n\nFreelancing has been on the rise over the last few years, but Covid has increased this development. This makes solving the challenges faced by freelancers not only more pressing but also more attractive.\n\n**So we ask:**\n\n*How could freelancer organise? What about freelancer unions? In different disciplines or even across?*\n\n**Which tool/service/platform would you \"wish into existence\", if you could, to improve your work as a freelancer?**", "created_at": "2020-11-03 09:08:19.969059", "updated_at": "2020-11-03 09:08:19.969059", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1131, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 17.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27739, "user_id": 64, "topic_id": 1634, "post_number": 14, "raw": "The Tool Box idea is great - a set of actions collated that can be used, changed, adapted in a <strong>context-driven</strong> scenario.\u00a0\n\nThe Tool Box itself should be kept <strong>open source</strong> to create a channel of learnings and feedback that can constantly refresh the kit.\u00a0\n\nWhat would be interesting would be to have a 'Best Practices' attached to the tool box to make contexts clear and approach more accessible.\u00a0\n\nA platform that can do this, I believe will make the change that we are discussing a reality as it enables us to create new organisation structures and methodolgies that we want to create and use.\u00a0\n\nI would love to hash out some ideas and get cracking with this if anyone is interested.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-08 11:52:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:33.048990", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 147, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10350], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63685, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11480, "post_number": 1, "raw": "@finnern has suggested to open a thread for people who are part of the Sci-Fi Economics Lab, and wish to introduce themselves to one another.

Its fast auto-complete and some upcoming <a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/issues/6\">fine-tuning of it</a> seem to be a nicely-working solution. You basically find a tag by what you remember about a tag's name. Which means that Ethnographers can still use an informal system of tag name prefixes and postfixes as a mnemotechnique (like, letting tags for specific initiatives begin with \"project: \"). The advantage over a formal hierarchy is that restructuring ones tags does not mean one has to re-learn their names / way to find them.\n\nThis leaves analysis as the realm where tag structures might still be needed. \"Tagging a tag\" as you proposed earlier is possible with a term reference field in the Drupal taxonomy that stores our tags, is exportable to RQDA (which supports \"tag groups\" but not hierarchies) and makes sense as \"assigning a broader concept\" to a tag just as a tag \"assigns a concept\" to a piece of text, as per the skos:Concept linked data interpretation.\n\n<strong>Update:</strong> The disadvantage of a prefix / postfix mnemotechnique as proposed above is of course the manual maintenance effort when changes to prefixes / postfixes are required, due to the implied redundancy. If that turns out later to be annoying and decreasing the speed of work to a significant amount, the \"tags of tags\" can also be included in a way that lets them be found via the auto-complete function.

First a bit about my professional life...\u00a0I work in public health with migrant communities in Barcelona, Spain. My background is humanitarian worker in refugee camps and conflict affected areas (mainly in Africa)\u00a0for various institutions. I have recently come back from Lesbos volunteering with the refugees with some friends with similar backgrounds. We were inspired by the work done by the volunteers taking on a huge share of the work of receiving the refugees alongside the usual suspects of the trade. We did feel that this amazing energy could\u00a0be better harnessed to provide a follow up for people arriving so that they are not left stranded and without help once they leave Greece, or when they arrive at their destination. Taking stock of all the local groups and projects that are currently working to help refugees, we did wonder: What happens to people who do not speak any european languages or even arabic? What happens to the ones who do not read and write, or use internet? Is there a way to provide information on resources available along the way to refugees/migrants at their point of entry so that the ones who are less 'networked' are not stranded?

In partnership with UCL and an existing consortium addressing populism across Eastern Europe, we will be applying our model of community outreach and building, online dialogue and social semantic network analysis in the context of European populism today. \n\nSpecifically, our contributions will be a structured effort to listen to the voices of the people on the ground. Populist themes resonate with a part the European population. To people who reject populism, this resonance can be hard to understand and empathise with, as it seems at odds with the observed long-term trends towards societal prosperity and openness. Conversely, people who find populism attractive cannot reconcile what they perceive with the optimistic narrative of their political adversaries. We hope to learn what the rise of populist politics looks like from the point of view of Europeans living their daily life. We pay special attention to supporters of the populist agenda. Ultimately, we hope to provide our fellow populist specialist researchers in the project with a breakdown of populism that encodes the point of view of the people directly affected by it, supporters and opposers.\n\nThis will see us engaging in unprecedented community management and ethnographic coding: bringing together voices across divergent perspectives and applying multilingual and multimedia ethnographic coding across Polish, Czech, Serbian and English (as the European lingua franca) contexts. \n\nYou can read the topic we responded to [here](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/governance-03-2018.html), and we'll be sharing more information on the project as we prepare to kick off early next year. \n\nThe research network are over the moon to be diving into such a pertinent and edgy topic as this and are looking forward to involving all of you in the journey ahead. \n\nSpecial shout out to our colleagues at UCL Jan and Richard for all their efforts, and of course @alberto on being my partner in crime to get this over the line.   \n\nHere we go!", "created_at": "2018-07-23 11:19:45.210325", "updated_at": "2018-07-23 19:40:56.718912", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 382, "wiki": false, "reads": 40, "score": 798.0, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4, 1935, 3293, 3, 3323, 4022, 4654], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63212, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11163, "post_number": 3, "raw": "[quote=\"JasonCole, post:2, topic:11163\"]\nIronically it was Milton Friedman who said \u201cOnly a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change.
