Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce w naszej s\u0142u\u017cbie zdrowia najs\u0142absz\u0105 strona jest SOR ( przyp.: Szpitalny Oddzia\u0142 Ratunkowy ). To, co tam si\u0119 dzieje, to jest... Jeden g\u0142\u00f3wny lekarz na zmianie i jednocze\u015bnie potrafi p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107 na oddzia\u0142 i przeprowadza\u0107 operacj\u0119. Zostaje na dole niedycyzyjny rezydent i czeka na tamtego, \u017ceby ten co\u015b potwierdzi\u0142, a ludzie siedz\u0105 tam i czekaj\u0105 po kilkana\u015bcie godzin. Jest totalny chaos.

Jest totalny brak organizacji; d\u0142ugie oczekiwanie pacjent\u00f3w... Zdecydowanie poprawi\u0142abym tam organizacj\u0119. Nie chodzi\u0142am prywatnie leczy\u0107 si\u0119 w czasie ci\u0105\u017cy, tylko na badanie USG ze wzgl\u0119du na to, \u017ce mam problem z dotrzymywaniem termin\u00f3w. Dostaj\u0119 skierowanie na badanie i zapominam um\u00f3wi\u0107 si\u0119 tego samego dnia na termin. Ale te\u017c obawiam si\u0119 brak\u00f3w w sprz\u0119cie, cho\u0107 nigdy tego nie do\u015bwiadczy\u0142am. Moja ginekolog daje mi skierowanie, bo u siebie w gabinecie co prawda ma aparat do USG, ale nie ma sprz\u0119tu do dok\u0142adnego badania wad rozwojowych. Jednocze\u015bnie to, \u017ce zap\u0142acisz za prywatn\u0105 wizyt\u0119, wcale nie oznacza, \u017ce ta porada b\u0119dzie kompatybilna z oczekiwaniami. A zapisanie si\u0119 do jakiegokolwiek specjalisty to jest dramat. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce w polskiej s\u0142u\u017cbie zdrowia panuje niez\u0142a znieczulica na pacjenta.

Jego mam\u0119 traktuj\u0105 jakby by\u0142a wariatk\u0105. Niekt\u00f3rzy maj\u0105 wyznaczone wizyty na 2025. O czym mowa? Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce jednak s\u0142u\u017cba zdrowia powinna by\u0107 cz\u0119\u015bciowo sprywatyzowana. Chocia\u017c prywatyzacja - tak jak w USA - \u017ce jak stracisz prac\u0119, nie masz umowy o prac\u0119 albo l\u0105dujesz na ulicy, nie ma dla nich \u017cadnej opieki zdrowotnej. Lekarzom si\u0119 nie chce, bo ma\u0142o zarabiaj\u0105 na oddziale. Oni zarabiaj\u0105 na prywantej praktyce. W Polsce to chyba zostaj\u0105 tylko specjali\u015bci, kt\u00f3rym nie chcia\u0142o si\u0119 uczy\u0107 na studiach albo ci, co zostaj\u0105 z wielkiego powo\u0142ania, jak misjonarze w Kambod\u017cy b\u0119d\u0105 ludzi ratowa\u0107. Chyba \u015brednio si\u0119 op\u0142aca pracowa\u0107 lekarzowi w pa\u0144stwowej s\u0142u\u017cbie zdrowia? Maj\u0105 dy\u017cury po 12 godzin, potem jeszcze prywatnie. Kiedy oni maj\u0105 odpocz\u0105\u0107? Jak maj\u0105 tam funkcjonowa\u0107? System jest jaki\u015b wadliwy w Polsce i \u0142ap\u00f3wkarstwo. Spotka\u0142am si\u0119 z tym. S\u0105 dwa r\u00f3\u017cne podej\u015bcia. Mamy wujka w szpitalu, kt\u00f3ry jest lekarzem.

Na pa\u0144stwowej wizycie. Z kolei partera mama przed operacj\u0105|: jej mama martwi\u0142a si\u0119 i wsadzi\u0142a w kopert\u0119 ok. 1 000 z\u0142. Pop\u0119dzi\u0142a z kopert\u0105 do lekarza, kt\u00f3ry mia\u0142 operowa\u0107. Posz\u0142a do niego z t\u0105 \u0142ap\u00f3wk\u0105, a on powiedzia\u0142, \u017ce nie bierze \u017cadnych pieni\u0119dzy, \u017ce ewentualnie jak b\u0119dzie nadal chcia\u0142a, mo\u017ce mu da\u0107 po operacji. Ostatecznie zanios\u0142a mu ciasto. S\u0105 uczciwi lekarze, s\u0105 i tacy, i tacy. Od generalizacji jestem daleka. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce ludzie prowokuj\u0105 taki klimat, do czego lekarze si\u0119 przyzwyczajaj\u0105.

Wygl\u0105da\u0142 jak gwiazda disco polo albo jak mafia pruszkowska z lat 90tych. A w gabinecie przyjmowa\u0142 rezydent. Wszystko tam robi\u0142.
