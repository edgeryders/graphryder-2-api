I am quite busy so no time to write a lot.\nWe are much more involved into organic farming and food sovereignty issues than catering or gastronomy but of course all this is related.\nNot sure if I want to learn something, maybe I can contribute somehow, I will try to attend.\nWe are not struggling more than others I guess, I would say the worst hit for the work we do is to not be able to travel freely in Europe as a lot of our projects are about connecting people and exchange experience between countries and especially related to family farming. No on-line connection will ever replace the practical fieldwork and in person experience.\n\nI would be happy to learn a bit more about the edgeryders initiative which is not so obvious from the website. I do understand there is an idea behind it to oppose the current populist and conservative trends?

Impressive indeed.\n\nA nonprofit I helped start is doing science education for forgotten groups in Belgium. These are children from underprivileged contexts, people with physical or mental disabilities etc. A while back we planned to teach long term hospitalized children, but sadly it did not go through. Our added value is being able to translate modern or complex science into fun and instructive activities suited for the target audience and their context. Maybe this can be the start of a further conversation.\n\nA group we have a hard time reaching is children with a migration background, especially those that are \"fine for the system\". They are not \"doing bad enough\" to be accompanied by specialized organisations, but by any measure they have a disadvantage that shows in their grades and ultimately how they enter society as young adults. There are many children from from Northern Africa here, and we have noticed that they need role models that they can relate to. Perhaps this is also something we can talk about.\n\nFinally, of course, I agree our health care system needs some serious reform.

Recentemente ho sviluppato diversi dispositivi elettronici di uso comune utilizzando anche Arduino. Dopo essermi sbizzarrito realizzando gli accessori pi\u00f9 ignoti, ho pensato di dare loro una voce per far si che possano essere utilizzati senza dover necessariamente buttare gli occhi su di un display.Successivamente allo sviluppo della circuiteria elettronica sperimentale, mi sono adoperato per dare una forma ed una veste a questi oggetti ed i miei amici mi hanno guidato verso Wemake, lo spazio che sognavo. Presso questo fablab ho conosciuto  fantastiche  persone che  interessate ai miei progetti, mi hanno fornito sin dal primo giorno il supporto necessario alla  realizzazione del prodotto finito..\nInizialmente, \u00e8 stato strutturato il lavoro da svolgere definendo  gli obiettivi  ed in seguito sono state selezionate le persone con le competenze pi\u00f9 adatte per svolgere i relativi compiti.\n\n**01_Why are we here**\n\n* Trovare spazio dove concretizzare i miei progetti\n\n* Trovare persone per svolgere compiti a me ardui come la realizzazione di oggetti  con laser cutter e stampanti 3D\n* Dare visibilit\u00e0  ei miei pensieri \n\n* Diffondere , confrontare e valorizzare le mie idee\n* Lanciare sul mercato nuove soluzioni\n\n**02_Create an elevator pitch**\n**IL** progetto Voice Instruments **\u00c8 UN** software / funzionalit\u00e0 open source **CHE** d\u00e0 una voce a dispositivi elettronici **PER** persone non vedenti o pi\u00f9 in generale impossibilitate alla lettura **CHE** altrimenti non potrebbero utilizzare agevolmente: stazioni meteo, termostati, multimetri.\n\n**A DIFFERENZA DI** prodotti/soluzioni attualmente presenti sul mercato, **IL NOSTRO PRODOTTO** \u00e8 pi\u00f9 versatile, economico ed adattabile a diverse esigenze.\n \n**03_Create a NOT list**\n\n* Istruire e guidare il designer nella realizzazione del case fino al momento del taglio e della stampa\n\n* Formulare una Bill of materials (BOM)\n* Specificare al PCB designer i componenti elettrici necessari e loro collegamenti per produrre e stampare il circuito stampato\n\n* Scrivere una libreria con relative guidelines per i due moduli audio pi\u00f9 diffusi: WTV020 e Mini DF Player\n\n\n**04_Size it up**\n_Saturday, September 2_\n\n* (GIANNI) formalizzazione della BOM e design del PCB\n\n* (GIULIO) aggiornamento  della libreria per il wtv020\n\n_Monday, September 4_\n\n* (GIULIO) scrittura della libreria per il DF player mini mp3\n\n* (ANDREA) progettazione e realizzazione del case\n\n_Tuesday, September 5_\n\n* (GIULIO) scrittura delle guidelines per l\u2019utilizzo dell\u2019interfaccia vocale\n\n* (ANDREA) progettazione realizzazione del case\n\n* (CHIARA) sottoscrizione del contratto di abbonamento a WeMake\n\n_Wednesday, September 6_\n\n* (PAOLO) creazione dei file audio per entrambi i moduli\n\n_Thursday, September 7_\n\n* (GIULIO) test delle funzionalit\u00e0 delle librerie\n\n_Friday, September 8_\n\n* (COSTANTINO and ALESSIA) Intervista\n\n* (COSTANTINO) Punto della situazione sul lavoro svolto e da svolgere\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\nA conclusione di questo percorso di MIR \u00e8 stato realizzato il primo prototipo di un pH-metro parlante secondo i requisiti definiti all\u2019inizio del percorso ed inoltre sono state sviluppate due librerie complete di guidelines per la gestione della lettura vocale di valori numerici e di messaggi di servizio funzionanti con i moduli audio pi\u00f9 diffusi utilizzabili con la maggior parte dei sensori e dei dispositivi presenti sul mercato.\n\nPer realizzare il primo prototipo del pH-metro parlante \u00e8 stato analizzato il progetto sperimentale e successivamente sono state condotte varie ricerche di mercato per selezionare i componenti pi\u00f9 adeguati allo scopo ed infine, in base ad essi \u00e8 stato disegnato il PCB.\n\nDopo aver definito le specifiche di quest\u2019ultimo \u00e8 stato disegnato un case capace di racchiudere il PCB ed i componenti.\n\nLa versione corrente del case \u00e8 stata realizzata in compensato tagliato a laser, il materiale \u00e8 stato scelto principalmente per  il  suo basso costo ed all\u2019elevata affinit\u00e0 acustica.\n\nLe librerie sono state concepite principalmente per la lettura di valori numerici e messaggi di servizio e per funzionare con due dei pi\u00f9 diffusi moduli audio.

Film is an\u00a0extremely powerful medium: capable of reaching wide audiences and stimulating new discussions and participants on a larger scale, thus bringing a level of speed and urgency that is appropriate.\u00a0\n\nWhen Nadia first approached me about the idea I thought of ways that a documentary today can live beyond film and become an interactive, living breathing vehicle of sorts. A project that always\u00a0evolves, getting\u00a0bigger and inspiring\u00a0others to interact\u00a0rather than simply be passively entertained or informed.\u00a0\n\nI know that we won't have problems finding people who would love to be involved, people who are passionate about film making, journalism, problem-solving and the topic of unemployment in Europe. Or perhaps others who wouldn't mind being the subject of the documentary.\u00a0\n\nBut first things first. Let's think design!\u00a0\n\nWhat can an interactive documentary\u00a0achieve within the resource constraints we deal with today? A few thoughts.\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A documentary need not be linear\u00a0or full-length format. Rather there could be episodes, and the narrative heterarchical and de-centralized\u00a0rather than being directed through a single voice.</li>\n\n<li>Problem/solution moments\u00a0can be operationalized and extracted from film and embedded into other spaces. Interactive ones that create a feedback loop, from spaces of collaboration and discussion and ending up right back into the \"documentary\", which could evolve in versions.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>The content within the documentary can exist in many parallel formats: for example a case example of one young European being challenged on film can also be explicated in a community wiki of sorts where problems/solutions are laid bare and analyzed.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo what do you guys think? Your ideas are highly valued at this stage. This could be an interesting opportunity for some of us to get first hand experience in journalism and\u00a0interactive film production methods: to say the least.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-05 08:49:56", "updated_at": "2017-10-03 09:45:26.614804", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 394, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41060, "user_id": 347, "topic_id": 7941, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Super super cool!\nI saw John in Bruxelles and I'm sure that the webinar will be very useful and rich.\nI'm teaching on those two days so I cannot attend, 10/11 January seems to be perfect days to learn new stuff :)\n\nAbout CIN @filomena I'm part of CAI ([Citizen Artist Incubator](http://www.citizenartist.eu/)) that both from the acronym and in the missions seems that could have different interactions with your network, tell us more, please, it will be amazing to do things together!", "created_at": "2018-01-08 10:22:34.237583", "updated_at": "2018-01-08 10:22:34.237583", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 89, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [41040], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16807, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3351, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Visas</b>\n\nApparently Edgeryders from Georgia, Armenia, Egypt, among other countries, will <a href=\"http://www.esteri.it/MAE/EN/Ministero/Servizi/Stranieri/IngressoSoggiornoInItalia/Visto_ingresso/Paesi_soggetti_visto.htm\">need a visa</a> to enter Italy and join us at Lote4.

I am writing free software, and I do not care what laws say. Laws are weapons of a ruling class.

The only thing that came to my mind is that 1. SHAME and 2. it s obvious the lack of a good educational system where people are taught the real democratic and non violent values. If I remember correctly they were times (specially in my country) when teachers used severe punishments to students in order to \"learn\" and I think these methods are present in their adult lives.\u00a0\n\nOf course, I suppose you are not talking about this kind of \"old education\", but more about \"<span>Teaching is about performing magic in someone else's head.\" \u00a0</span>still we need to keep the good old stuff including the new technology and make education a tool for a forwarding society.\u00a0\n\nI don't know if you have already read Giacomo's story about <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/reality-check/mission_case/evaluation-broke-education\" target=\"_blank\">Broke Education</a>.

Then you tell them about someone like [elf Pavlik] - that forces them to ask practical questions and get thinking about it as a real alternative lifestyle rather than just a concept. I also like this idea of parties/events (productive leisure).

At least that's the case for me. Once you've mastered a foundation of said skill it's a lot easier to build upon and thus gets easier to improve the skill. So if you're venturing in learning a new skill from scratch as I'm sort of doing right now. I think it's good to dedicate a big chunk of your time to just learning it\n\nHow do you work with time management? It's a tricky question. Earlier this year while I was working I was trying to keep up learning as well. It worked to some extent, although back then I didn't keep track of how much time I was dedicating to my learning process. I found it a bit difficult to keep myself motivated. And at the end of the working day I'd rather just slack and do other stuff.\n\nNow I have the opposite problem, I have loads of time but not the kind of structure a job gives you. So as I started to track my time it started to give me a structure that I could follow. I could set goals and improve the amount of hours I was learning programming. At the same time it would track how many hours I was doing other things than actually learning in front of the computer.\u00a0\n\nI use the social sharing component as partly a support mechanism and partly an accountability mechanism. Every week I've been including the amount of learning time as well as the amount of time spent just surfing the web. Learning programming and using the browser is not mutually exclusive of course. But it's very easy to go off at a tangent and find interesting stuff and the day just flies away.\u00a0\n\nThat's definitely a key take away; to limit yourself to as few websites as possible while you're trying to learn. If I look at the webhistory of the last month the websites that I've visited less than 2 minutes are 850 websites which amounts to the total time of 8 hours. An entire working day!\n\nSo how do I actually track it all? I use a small application called \"Timing\" on Mac. Neat unobtrusive app that tells you how many hours you spend on either certain applications or projects of yours. I think you could derive a lot of other uses from the the data as well.\u00a0\n\nIf you had the data, what questions would you ask or find out? What patterns would you look for?\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-11 20:15:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:24.888981", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 472, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 2161], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57862, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 10530, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![68480676_487121595191496_4969750879184879616_n|690x262](upload://iQMifu6uPeVUHBn5nQdgnHK4wBR.jpeg)\n\n[date=2019-08-13 time=09:30:00  format=\"Africa/Tunisia\"  timezone=\"Europe/Brussels\" timezones=\"UTC\"] \u2192 [date=2019-08-13 time=10:30:00  format=\"Africa/Tunisia\"  timezone=\"Africa/Tunis\" timezones=\"UTC\"] I  **OurGhema Space, 4100 Medenine** \nOrganisers: @yosser @zmorda @sohayeb\n\n<br>\n\n_If you have an idea that answers a real community need and solves a social or environmental problem, or if you have a set of skills and you wish to take part of a social venture, then come and learn more about our exciting opportunities during our first info session which will take place at @Yosser 's  OurGhema Coworking Space on Tuesday at 9:30 am!_\n\n<br>\n\n**About**\n\u201cOpen Collective Intelligence Lab\u201d is the first P2P virtual incubator to support aspiring young social entrepreneurs in the MENA region through online mentoring, fellowships and networking.\n\nOpen Collective Intelligence labs are part of a mutual support program for social entrepreneurs powered by the Edgeryders Community.

I would not have expected that the first unMonastery would be renovated before unMonasterians move in ... it's of course much appreciated. I welcome the \"reuse and recycle\" approach for the furniture ... fits great for the uM idea as it's a way to use minimal resources for a set goal, just as the rest of the uM projects will be. Also, high 5 for the plants integration ... properly selected, might this also solve the humidity issue in these buildings in the winter times (Ben mentioned it some time ago)?\n\nDon't know what input I can contribute here from a distance. However, one thing comes to mind: What's the Internet bandwidth in the building, and how can it be distributed in the building? Wifi would be used within a room of course, but given these big stone walls in the uM space, and general poor performance of wifi in crowded spaces, I guess cabling is the preferable option for getting Internet to the rooms. For that, I see a lot of phone cabling in the floor plans ... that's great, as even if there's no dedicated network cabling, then the twisted pair phone cabling can be reused for 10 MBit network cables. It works well in short lengths as in a house, I have done this hack multiple times in places where I live(d). An alternative would be routing the network over the power network for distribution (from ca. 30 EUR per pair of boxes).\n\nIf my application for unMonastery goes through, or before / during LOTE3 anyway, I would be up for helping to finish the network installation. Have some experience with network installations in abandoned spaces, from providing the network on an abandoned army base for a music festival ;-)\n\nAnother thing (but since I'm not officially from the uM team I will just throw the remark in the room): Is there intention for having a workshop space in the Palazzo del Casale as well? For working with raw material that is not information, like electronics hardware, wood, metal, ... . (I guess this depends a lot on the selection of uM projects though, about which I don't know.)\n\nOh and ... what mean the big half-circles across rooms in the floor plans?

And no time tracker is needed at all (by Edgeryders) as we only need \"work hours per work package\" numbers per _month_ from collaborators, not per day or intra-day.\n\n2. Updates to what information is required for the invoice comment field, as per [your earlier annotations](/t/id/9143/23).\n\nCould you please organize who takes on the Edgeryders admin's role in \"[2.2.

It includes many national ID cards as they are all smartcards, and in fact both the Estonian, Belgian, German etc. governments use OpenSC to implement their \"national\" flavor of the software.\n\nTo sign documents, OpenSC needs to be complemented with a software with a graphical user interface. These days, that would be [j4sign](http://j4sign.sourceforge.net/) (still in active development). Before, there was [Open Signature](http://opensignature.sourceforge.net/english.php) for that, but sadly it is unmaintained since 2008. Such a tool would enable to use all cards in the same manner and with the same software to sign and verify `.pdf` files, not requiring the DigiDoc `.bdoc` stuff etc..

I guess he does not get many proposals like that.\n\nNo harm in asking \u2013 the thing is interesting enough. Would you like that, guys? [Ben]?

Plus, votre mod\u00e8le doit permettre de distinguer d'autres exp\u00e9riences qui pourraient lui ressembler et dire pourquoi ces exp\u00e9riences sont les m\u00eames ou autres.\n\nPar exemple \"un endroit o\u00f9 <u>chacun</u> peut ... \u00a0et a le <u>m\u00eame</u> acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des <u>connaissances</u> et des <u>savoir-faire</u>, des <u>moyens de production</u> pour les appliquer et exp\u00e9rimenter\". A ma connaissance. vous n'avez pas de th\u00e9orie qui explique comment \"chacun peut avoir le m\u00eame acc\u00e8s\" \u00a0et qui est \"chacun\" et que veut dire le \"m\u00eame acc\u00e8s\". Si vous ignorez les th\u00e9ories et exp\u00e9riences de Watson et Goodenough, entre autres, alors vous n'avez pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la notion de \"barri\u00e8re cognitive\" et vous risquez de confondre \"le m\u00eame acc\u00e8s\" avec \"cela doit \u00eatre accessible \u00e0 n'importe qui par les moyens qui lui conviennent\".\n\nLa distinction entre connaissance, savoir-faire et moyen de production ne peut que s'appuyer sur des mod\u00e8les qui sont suffisamment diff\u00e9rents pour vous \u00e9viter de croire qu'en utilisant ces mots vous avez tout dit. Il vous faut un mod\u00e8le -- ou un ensemble de mod\u00e8le -- qui articule a minima ces trois termes.\n\nEnfin \"Un endroit qui encourage la curiosit\u00e9 et le m\u00e9lange des cultures\" semble vouloir dire que vous savez ce que veut dire \"encourager la curiosit\u00e9\", que vous estimez que la \"curiosit\u00e9\" est le moteur ou l'un des moteurs de ce que vous voulez faire. Vous semblez dire aussi que vous savez ce que signifie \"culture\" et ce que veut dire \"m\u00e9langer des cultures\"\n\nEst-ce le cas?\n\nCordialement\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-18 15:25:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:59.028589", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 392, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16053], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11636, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1795, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Good story :-)</b>\n\nPolitecnico was indeed kickstarted by the giants of the Milanese school of the 60s \u2013 the very guys who invented design.

It would probably be best to figure out an interesting introduction into why and for whom are we doing it, and then explain what do the particular events offer, and how is this all connected. Finally, as @johncoate pointed out - why is it a festival to start with (managing expectations :))\n\nAlso, there's a lot of calls for actions, but in fact, since this is a door for us to invite new people, we should rather lay out opportunities for them than ask for work and help without meeting them first.\n\n**Considering the size of the events,** we don't necessarily need to ask people to help with tasks, at least not yet. I would suggest concentrating on building energy around the event, fleshing out a wonderful invitation and making sure that we manage to onboard 50 quality participants for the events.\n\n\n**The signup** form probably should be changed. We have two alternatives:\n\none signup form that would still look pretty much like the one we have already, but we first give the people chance to select the city in which they want to attend, and then a customized form that asks for:\n\nemail \nname \nmultiple choice for the specific session you'd like to attend, and an \"other window\" option, where you could ask for a session you'd like to attend, and we can see what we can do for you (let's not ask complete strangers what they want to do for us - let's ask what we can do for them, as we need their information and input at some point, and that's how we will be paid back for this effort)\n\nAnd send in - we get their data and we can follow up manually, crafting the right message.\n\n\n\n**A second option** for the signup would be to have all events displayed on the main site in some way (would need to think of the logic) and then under each city, we would have a short description what this event is centred around, and thumbnails that direct you to descriptions of the sessions. \n\nThis way we show to our visitors, unfamiliar with edgeryders, what we do, who we are, directly: what's happening in their cities and we ask that the only thing you need to do to join the event is to pick a session that seems interesting to you, click on the picture and tell us in a comment why do you like it /how does it resonate with you. \n\nAlso, I would need a polish version of this funnel, as it would be very strange to promote an event catered for the Polish audience in polish language exclusively with an English website. \n\nIf you feel there's something we should offer, we'd have a link to a post about the festival in general, asking what do people want, and ask them to leave a comment there. \n\n\nThese are some of the suggestions - please add what's missing @MariaEuler and @johncoate \n\n**Redefine what a participant in this context is and what is given and what is requested.**\nAs the planning for the events of this endeavour progresses it becomes clear that this is not a eat, drink, dance kind of festival. It is fun in so far as it is fun to develop and share your ideas. \nTherefore we have to move a little bit in the way we see our participants. We are asking them to come to and work, creat content and discuss it best on the platform. Maybe it would be the right way to change the communication from \"help out some way and get your ticket\" to we give you this opportunity to meet stimulating people and have a location and some food during it and in turn, you contribute your mind, words and ideas. You participate in a workshop and listen to the talk and make a post about it or about yourself. This already asking enough. Things like cooking and graphics design can be bought with the budget we have. Ideas and discussions can not be bought and are what we really want to get. Therefore we should maybe change the communication of what it means to be a participant and in turn how to communicate and talk to them.\n\nopen village had different unifying and motivating factors that are not present in this years approach such as the one location and the meeting of people from the community that you are already interested in. Now we want to reach out more and motivate people to join in from outside. We are still providing opportunities but we do not have the social aspect already there and also still have to \"sell\" them on the platform, motivate them to post something there. So asking them for anything else than to participate and to post might be contra-productive.\n\nMaybe also @inge - do you have some good tips or reflections?", "created_at": "2019-10-03 15:24:33.365340", "updated_at": "2019-10-03 18:10:55.276552", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 872, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 262.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 2915, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34901, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6637, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Hi guys, next email to Festival participants is due this week, don't you think?\n\n@natalia_skoczylas  if you can prepare a draft that would be great!

I think that the reason for that is that I have difficulties to imagine, sitting here, what exactly we are to crowdfund. I know it is LOTE event... but when I been to two previous LOTE I haven't seriously (and collectively) visualised them in a head as crowdfundable universes. And that's what I would really like to get from this\u00a0session.\u00a0\n\nInspiring crowdfunders I spoke to, since we proposed this session,\u00a0had a very strong image in the head of what they are asking money for and why is it important. I don't think they had doubts about whether it is appropriate to sk for money from everywhere and everyone. Or may be they had, but didn't tell me when I asked.\n\nI have a hunch that one of the super-powers of ER is some sort of a crowd-imagination. I guess is a second leap towards practical real life realisation of things which are wanted and imagined. Oh, I'm opening some sort of meta-can here. So I stop.\u00a0\n\nThe main reason I'm\u00a0so eager to connect this session to ones on video documenting and prod, is that I think the video-sound (relatively coherent)\u00a0representation\u00a0of what happens at LOTE is the huge part of crowdfunding campaign. It's more than a promotional video, but rather a LOTE universe. Or see in more concrete terms what do we want from the LOTE4? And crowdfund what we see.\n\nIt might turn out that we will come up with a campaign to crowdfund not\u00a0the next LOTE as such, but something\u00a0which is connected to it?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-16 16:23:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:49.733443", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 370, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38457, "user_id": 3704, "topic_id": 7385, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Hackuarium might want to do a hangout too during the festival!\nCan we figure out best times/days for these, and make a sort of rota, if bandwidth/connections are lacking?\nthx!\n(looking forward)", "created_at": "2017-10-17 17:35:40.172044", "updated_at": "2017-10-17 17:35:40.172044", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 34, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30856, "user_id": 2095, "topic_id": 3381, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>An oasis in the urban desert: Al - Azhar Park, Cairo - Egypt</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>From mounts of rubbish amassed during 500 years to a park in Cairo...</span><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://thearchibums.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/al-azhar-park-live.jpg\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Azhar_Park\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-18 18:18:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:49.812403", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 90, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23749, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1823, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Thanks for a quick feedback. \n\n@sammuirhead are you up to doing one of those 5 min experience sharing?

So these are \"official\" categories and we can't use others, right?\n[/quote]\n\nOk good point but that would involve being super clear with anyone filling out Free Agent that they are not a subcontractor in the Horizon2020 usage, and explicating what support is. Do you agree that we could have these two categories as what I propose above in Free Agent but then when they are imported to the spreadsheet for copy into the coordinator's report, they are updated to the reporting language? Or perhaps even automate it if easy.\n\nAlso noted re the importance for keeping non-eligible direct costs.\n\n- With translation of hours to PMs yes that makes sense. Contracts will not mention hourly rates but rather a flat rate with number of hours, days, months, and percentage of time. So if I've understood correctly - and perhaps you may like to pipe in here @alberto - the key is to get team members to log hours - as we need timesheets - and make sure these can translate to PMs - as this is how the work is reported. \n\n- Speaking of, UCL got [their financial reporting template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xLuP_NZGAnCg1rd__FPnFOh7olYG_pTH) to me. It's not particularly useful in that it's not a spreadsheet nor requests anything other than costs in a table with a bunch of other qualitative info, but may be worthwhile taking a look to briefly check in case it updates your understanding on any different outputs.\n\n- In terms of **timing**, we'll be having team members log their work on these projects from 1 January 2019 so ideally the tool is set up before then.

You inspired me to think about how this might look like practically. One way how a moneyless insight deal might look like is a Q&amp;A format: a StackExchange type of site like <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com\">StackOverflow</a>, but integrated with network barter as a payment system so that the Edgeryders citizen experts can earn value by providing answers. It's always difficult though how to mix accounted value exchange into voluntary communities. So maybe all the value for answers would go to Edgeryders as the Community, not to the individuals? As in \"you can support the Edgeryders community with your expertise, for example an answer to this question would be worth 50 EUR in barter, and in exchange we will keep providing and maintain the infrastructure services for Edgeryders: the website, LOTEs, the company shell for projects, and free help to make your own projects happen\". This would feel like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Answers\">Google Answers</a> service of old, but for barter. A moneyless micro consulting service \u2013 from citizens, to citizens and institutions if they like. (Wild thoughts, just sayin'. Sorry for questioning all about the Edgeryders business model again ... .)\n\nAs for an upskilling session on bartering at LOTE3: direct barter and existing barter platforms, and also LETS type local currencies (often called barter rings) do not really work as mode of exchange. It's great for further research, but not for upskilling. If we're ready with a release of Economy App by then, there would be a new solution that hopefully makes barter work as an alternative for money. I'd be open to do a session on that, but as it will be very new then, it's rather exploration and testing than upskilling ... .

Expect them to be a bit flabberghasted because you aren't following the \"correct procedure\", but if you are well prepared and can keep it friendly and very brief (you can usually be very direct with Germans) - I think you have good chances. Unfortunately it looks like poor Gabriela did not get a telephone - so you may have to call Stefan (ends on -3441) and ask him to get her on the phone (usually they are next door or so). Perhaps you want to take a short look at their research (especially that of Prof. Otterpohl) beforehand, so you are on the same page.

Ostensibly the group of foreigners (edgeryders) are initially there to meet one another, share and learn some new skills but then also turn some of that energy around into the surrounding neighbourhood and city beyond. We are supposing that from day one of the gathering local Materans are also invited to somehow join in the LOTE process along with the design of the present/future unMon.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 But what do the entry points look like for 'ordinary' local folk? And even for some of us 'ordinary' unlocal, edgeryder folk? What kind of meeting grounds are we actually preparing for one another? What do we hope to be communicating with one another? Who will translate for who? Is it simply about translating words or do we rather hope to be translating truly innovative, yet unspoken, even untranslatable, intentions, ideas, dreams and ways of being, ways of taking action? This will be a bunch of humans coming together with the desire to somehow collaborate and learn from on another, to codesign new urban, social as well as very personal possibilities. What do humans need?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 How do we create space for body/minds/spirits to stay integrated, feel present, embodied and sustainable in an environment of high level learning, innovation and exchange? What will a group of foreigners and locals meeting up need in order to feel comfortable in themselves, to truly step forward, to put forward their various thoughts, ideas, viewpoints? And what kind of space or spaces will they need so as to then try things out, to create....make mistakes, play, experiment, co-work, prototype...?\n\nOk so these are simply the beginnings of a few of my questions. What is this gathering and exchange going to look and feel like to all of us aliens when we land on this new planet? I want to hear more about hosting/curating some sort of open, common learning space for us all (in body/mind/spirit) to feel welcome.

How did we process the data to get there? What does it even mean to combine ethnography with network science anyway?  \n\nFirst, we briefly explain how we used ethnography and network science to organize the OpenCare corpus into structured data. You will learn how ethnographers process data (they call it \u201ccoding\u201d), and try your hand at coding Edgeryders posts. Next, we use an application called GraphRyder to navigate and interpret those data, organized in form of network. In the end we will discuss our findings. For those inclined to hack network data (build new visualizations, for example), we will do that too. \n\nCome if you want to learn about digital ethnography, and how you can use networks to explore ethnographic data to reach your own conclusions. Warning: hacking might happen. People with both humanities and science/tech background welcome.\n\n\n### What we'll do\n\n_This is a highly interactive session: bring your laptops! We will form groups of 3-4 people each. You can go through the session following either of the two Ways described below (but not both).

(I don't mean everyone, but the institutions and companies who are responsible for these needs)\n\n\u2022 Who is already working with this?\u00a0(and why we can do it better)\n\n\u2022 Go through those who is already doing what we can do better and is payed for it (their functions, may be their business models too, we can copy&amp;optimise)\n\nSo my point is, map orgs and needs, as examples, as a part of \\#1 challenge, answering these questions in a very very short way. Unless we have some sort of a wiki like this already. We can also list things we have a capacity and skills to do.\u00a0Otherwise there are good examples of all aforementionned stuff get lost in comments.\n\nThese questions might have very problematic answers: such as some institutions outsourcing something they can't solve should not even be there.

The two entities are separate but intimately linked. The social enterprise's sole mission is to build and maintain the social and technical infrastructure that keeps the community thriving and growing. And a lot of work goes into outreach to spotlight the value of community members projects, management, network weaving, fostering collaborations, convening people and coordinating the work of putting together community events like \\#LOTE.  We need to generate revenue to ensure resilience so we can do the necessary work required to get community member's initiatives like the unMonastery off the ground. And keep them there. And support many many more of them happening.\n\nThis is a situation that a lot of people are faced with and if we can come up with a good process for achieving economic sustainability, then we would be adding a valuable contribution towards enabling community-powered transformation. I would very much appreciate you getting on board, shaping and driving the above process dedicated to figuring this out together.

And I discovered that I basically have no freetime \u2026 there is always something that must be done \u2026 :| )\n\nI'll write some more even if it does not belong to the question in a narrow sense, to help you compile an article from this without further back and forth.\n\nAnd one more thing: I write and publish a lot on the web, about problems, ideas, solutions and thoughts. But nearly never about me personally or my life circumstances. That's just not very important and also the web is not the most trustable place to put that out. It won't be different here, so don't be surprised. In other words: there will be no home story.\n\n----\n\n> **1. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself: who is @Matthias?**\n\nSomebody unusual. A friend called me once a living synthesis of the arts (\"Gesamtkunstwerk\" in German) :smile: I don't know how true that is \u2026 but it's true that I'm an unusual person and try to make sense of life in a way that's different from how anyone I know tries to. And I try to make sense without contradictions between the pieces of my life. That's probably why this friend called me a \"Gesamtkunstwerk\". He's a musician; as an engineer I'd rather called it systems engineering, but yeah, different models, same reality :)\n\n> **2. What are you most proud of in your life?**\n\nI can't recall anything. Maybe I was proud of something earlier in my life. But the global ecological crisis became very obvious to me, and also that I have not found a single point of leverage to fix it. I mean, to help fixing it at scale. Not just by living a minimal consumption lifestyle \u2013 that's not about fixing anything, it's just about me not making it worse as fast as I could.\n\nFor a bit of background: when I say \"minimal consumption lifestyle\" it is about some experimental techniques that I use to drive resource consumption towards zero. I made myself the guinea pig of these ideas, and I'm learning a lot, and the more ideas I try the more I have. Practically I live in a 9 m\u00b2 deep freezer box (mounted to an oldtimer firetruck) and heat it during the winter with a bit of trash wood. (If it's not obvious: that's carbon neutral.) I use 600-700 Wh of electricity per day, which is about 90% less than the per-capita electricity consumption in Germany where I originate from. Except for two months in winter, all of that electricity is made on my rooftop with 400 W<sub>peak</sub> of solar panels. The same 90% reduction applies to water, probably to buying \"new stuff\", and in the future hopefully also to trash generation. (For that, I'm working on a plastic shredder and [this foldable 3D printer](https://www.instructables.com/id/Bergen-Makerspace-Transportable-3D-Printer/) \u2013 foldable because it has to fit into my limited 9 m\u00b2 living space \u2013 to recycle all plastic trash into useful objects.)\n\nAnd all this does not feel like scarcity. It's just how you adapt your behavior naturally when you live in a truck and more consumption means more work. As in, you have to carry all your water and wastewater in 20 l jerrycans in and out. I think that it is mostly this [behavior setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_settings) that drives down consumption. If that holds up to further examination, it means that this is a simple antidote to the dreaded [rebound effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_effect_(conservation)) that kills most or all technological efficiency gains. It's basically about cutting off the grid. Haha, what a \"realistic\" policy proposal :laughing: \n\n> **3. Who did you look up to when you were growing up?**\n\nLet's put it like this: I have been raised as a follower of Jesus the Christ. That's still where all my idealism and strong moral convictions come from, both of which are preventing me from having any success as a grown-up in this society :smile: Maybe that's the reason why I never really became a member of this society.\n\nLet's say, I'm a visitor. I come and go. I live here and there, and I like remote villages in so-called \"developing\" regions the most \u2026 and also any place close to nature. I imagine in quite some details how else a civilization could be organized, and I publish about that stuff. (It does not mean that my publishing changes anything or anyone changes. So far the main benefit is just that I can justify to myself why I abstain from making more money by taking a 9-5 job in an ecologically destructive \"civilization\".)\n\nNow I'm very interested in technology (and I guess I should be, as CTO of Edgeryders) and all my visions for a different mode of civilization are grounded in what is technologically possible. If you want a taste of that,  my publication \"[An Autarky System for Cities](/t/9141)\" is a concise collection of such ideas. (There's also something called [EarthOS](https://ma.juii.net/blog/earthos-0-13), which later inspired the Edgeryders [EarthOS unit](/c/earthos). But I have to warn you. That one is a thousand pages of unsorted ideas and inventions for anarchist ecological civilizations. Let me bring that into a publishable form first \u2026)\n\n> **4. What was your biggest failure, and why do you feel like it was?**\n\nMmmh, that's not really a category that exists in my thinking. By social norms I'd be probably expected to say \"that I don't have any impact with my ideas\". But success or impact is a social phenomenon, so it's absence could be my failure, sure, but there is also the very real possibility that not granting this success _is a failure of everyone else_. And given that I'm basically saying with my ideas and proposals that Western civilization is rotten to the core and has to be rebuilt from scratch \u2026 I can imagine how this is not a particularly attractive message :) But I don't mind. Everything has its time, and with a crisis comes opportunity \u2026\n\n> **5. Why are you part of edgeryders, and how did that happen?**\n\nWell \u2026 I was following @hexayurt on Twitter and some good day in 2012 he posted that \"Edgeryders\" is organizing a European conference for activists and attendance is free. That was [LOTE1](/c/workspaces/lote1). So I went there, made some good friends, Council of Europe paid the train tickets, and @alberto said he might have a job for me in the next iteration of Edgeryders. And the rest is history.\n\n> **6. What kind of impact do you hope to have with what you do?**\n\nLike I said, I think we have to rebuild civilization from scratch. I'm doing some of the foundational work, and I hope I can inspire enough others to join so we can make it happen.\n\nIt's not realistic, though. Sometimes I think that: nothing will happen, I will have the same zero impact I had so far. We'll burn the planet down completely, devastate the remaining animal populations and plant habitats as we go, and then humans will go extinct, too, and leave the planet in the _tohubohu_ state it had in the very beginning.\n\nBut then again, why would it _have_ to end like that? Why?? [I am as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!!](https://youtu.be/ZwMVMbmQBug?t=62) I want to at least _show_ that an eco-restorative civilization is possible. So what's the smallest size for such a civilization to exist? I think 150 \u2013 200 people. That's it. The challenge is not so much a technical one but a political one: Europe is so full of millions of elite-serving, innovation-stiffling, crappy rules and laws that it is impossible to do this here. What then, let's get an old oil rig and go to international waters? That's EarthOS Equipment Level 5. But no, not really \u2026 there have to be better ways to demo this. I'll give it some more thinking \u2026 and of course, suggestions are welcome.\n\n> **7. Tell me more about the most memorable period in your life and how this has shaped you**\n\nI always knew I'm a misfit in Europe, but only after [my time in Nepal](/c/workspaces/future-makers-nepal) for Edgeryders it became clear to me how much that is true. I had a profound \"reverse culture shock\" experience when coming back from Nepal: nothing here in Europe made sense anymore, all the luxury and resource waste felt just obscene, and on top of that Europe felt deeply miserable and hopeless. It is as if, in spite of all that wealth here, Europeans realize that we're collectively stuck with our way of doing \"civilization\": there's no progress anymore, nothing improves, and all along we're destroying our own natural living environment.\n\nOn the contrary, there is a lot of hope in Nepal: a road is coming to the village, or piped water supply arrives (actually they installed it in our house in Kathmandu while @natalia_skoczylas and I lived there!), or so many other little steps of progress. And they expect it will continue like that. That's what a hopeful civilization feels like.\n\nNow I don't say they _should_ feel hopeful: they're implementing the same type of wasteful, industrial, capitalist civilization that we got stuck in and that is implemented in more or less the same way everywhere on the planet. But I say, it feels so much better to feel hopeful! Without hope, a lot of resentment soon becomes political mainstream, as we can observe in Europe today.\n\nAnd, purely from a tech perspective, from what physics allows humans to do, there is a lot of reasons to be hopeful. (Just go and calculate how much energy the sun radiates to Earth every day.) We're stuck because our political elites expect the transition to an ecological civilization to be effortless, and because our capitalist overlords expect it to be profitable for them. That won't happen. A [Green New Deal for Europe](https://diem25.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EuropeanSpring-Manifesto-2019.ENG_.pdf#page=17), or however it will be named when it comes, will be hard work for everyone.

In a movie about Saint Francis' life, Francis was contrary to\u00a0a rule for his followers who, instead,\u00a0were asking one to him. I do not know if it is true or fictional. I think both, maybe the source is one\u00a0of the legends about Saint Francis. In the movie, the followers are portrayed\u00a0as \"weak\" because living with a rule is easier than living without rules (like Saint Francis). However, I think the reason for an unRule is another. In this book (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Method), Feyerabend says that the only principle that does not inhibit progress is \"anything goes\" and this motto could be a very cool unRule: anything goes, the only rule is that there are no rules.\n\nWhat he says, imo, is very close to some\u00a0points of the unHagiography written by Alberto. In particular, action has priority over theory, because theory is often an a-posteriori rationalization of experience. In a similar way a\u00a0Rule is an attempt to formalize \"Truth\" or \"Good\" within a framework, but \"Truth\" or \"Good\" escapes formalization. In other words, rules are useful when living together, but we should not take a rule for the Truth or Good it rapresents.\n\nRegarding the dealing of serious issues and decision making, you should consider the consensus method (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making). This summer I was in a commune where people have been using this method for 30-40 years and they say it works. They apply the consensus method to everything, from ordinary life to most important and serious decisions. A commune is a small community (that one was about 20-30 people), but it has a lot of similarities with monastic life, above all, the importance of work and the idea of sharing everything.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-08 19:17:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:42.816117", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 390, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60756, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11030, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![Cory-Plain|690x459](upload://l88kNIuqK9Ghkbvkv6P9DCASe4A.jpeg) \n\n**Award-winning Science Fiction Author and Journalist** \nCory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist, journalist and blogger \u2014 the author of novels such as Walkaway, Pirate Cinema, Little Brother, Rapture of the Nerds and Makers. \n\nHe is an MIT Media Lab Research Affiliate, a Visiting Professor of Computer Science at Open University, a Visiting Professor of Practice at the University of South Carolina\u2019s School of Library and Information Science and co-founded the UK [Open Rights Group](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/).

Plus a screenshot for backup :) If there is an option, please do this test twice: once via wifi connection as normal, once by connecting your computer with a network cable connection to the Internet router instead.</li>\n\n<li><strong>List of devices.</strong> While in the building, please also note the manufacturers and type numbers of all Internet connection related devices that are connected there. They're normally on a label on their back ... . This will help us to know if the network devices are sufficient for our 150 people conference, or if we have to bring something else. If you can, simply make photos of the network devices, and of the labels on the back of the devices.\n\nEspecially I'd also like to know if there is only one Internet router where the connection comes into the building, or if someone already has set up multiple wifi routers / access points, or at least cables for that, to distribute Internet in the building. So please also make photos of network cable connections in the building. If there are none, make photos of phone cable connections ... we can hack them to route Internet for us as well.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Optional: contract.</strong> If you could find out the conditions of the Internet provider contract existing for the unMonastery building it would be helpful, but not strictly necessary.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSince we're quite at the limit of available time already for getting proper wifi hardware if we need anything else for the conference, I'd be happy if we could get these questions answered by Wednesday at latest. If something is unclear, <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/contact\">just contact me any way you like</a> about this.

Me, I do data analysis and admin. In tech projects like OpenCare I also write myself into the development work, so that I have some time budgeted to spend with the developers doing testing, specifications etc. So, the same bill will contain time spent on different work packages. Furthermore, this is just useless form filling, because a different document tracks the allocation of time across WPs: the timesheet. If you have timesheets (and we are obliged to have them), you do not need to track the WP of bills, even if bills were allocated to just one work package. Therefore, I propose the indication of the WP is no longer required on bills (where people claim payment for their time). \n\n2. When it comes to things other than work time (i.e. travel + purchase of goods and services), tracking by WP is also not required. On the grant agreement, such things are divided by partner, but not by WP. So, again, even when claiming expenses I propose that we do not require the WP number. Down with form filling! :-)\n\n3. On the other hand, our contracts do not require people to issue different bills for different projects in each period. That could make things difficult to track.\n\nConcluding, for each project we need to always keep up to date the following information:\n\n* Time worked, broken down by work package\n* Total EUR spent on staff \n* Total EUR spent on travel\n* Total EUR spent on other goods and services.\n\nI propose to use the comment line minimally. Ideally, if API queries can tell a bill apart from an expense claim, it would work like this:\n\n* On bills: just put the project, the entry date and the indication `h2020_costtype`. This can be equal to `personnel, travel`, or `other-goods-services`. That's it.\n* On expenses: put the project and the entry date.

Sound is known to help channel and move mental, emotional, energetic and physical states, balance the state of being.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>The workshop will include some theoretical aspects about sound therapy and use of voice in particular in meditation, communication and therapy.</span>\n\n<span>We will touch on the following subjects and practice following techniques:</span>\n\n<span>-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></span><span>Vocal warm-ups</span>\n\n<span>-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></span><span>Voice as scanning tool</span>\n\n<span>-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></span><span>Voice to move energy</span>\n\n<span>-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></span><span>Finding your voice</span>\n\n<span>-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></span><span>Toning and overtoning</span>\n\n<span>-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></span><span>Human energy system: chakras, nadis and the qualities associated with them</span>\n\n<span>-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></span><span>Chakra sounds and sonic hot chocolate</span>\n\n<span>-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></span><span>Balancing energy system with vocal practice</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Everyone welcome, but spaces will be limited\u00a0</span>\n\n</div>", "created_at": "2013-10-15 11:43:39", "updated_at": "2017-09-15 10:11:04.804933", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 483, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1438, 1457, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9797, "user_id": 129, "topic_id": 2051, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Existing Material</b>\n\nGreat Nadia, thanks for this compilation!

And I want to tell you that we are preparing our presentation in the best way.\n\nNadia, I think that the Sassi cleanup was a meeting moment for us. Students who spend few weeks a year in their hometown come together and do something positive for Matera. It is a wonderful thing - in my opinion - because in this way we can maintain and make the feeling with our city stronger. A city that needs us. Anyway\u2026 we will tell you during our session and you can see also our video! About unMonastery residency program for students, I also think it is an important opportunity for thesis projects. We can publicize it through our network of students who follow Profumo di Svolta, but I think that a public conference (or unconferece - I try ;) ) in LOTE is not the best way because few materani will participate (students aren't in Matera in this period). We can make a post or a multimedia content and share it, I think!\n\nNoemi, thank you. Having a blog and a Facebook profile is not enough for us and for our way of living the relationship with Matera.\n\nA session is enough for our presentation and it's better on Saturday. Maybe after or before mt2019 community presentation (we share many Profumo di Svolta projects with community).\n\nBen, thank you very much for the welcoming. The opportunity of unMonastery residency program is already on our internal Facebook group, but only 2 or 3 of us are going to graduate next year\u2026 Anyway I think we can do something to spread the range of the students who will know unMonastery! I will be in Matera on October 26 so we can meet up after LOTE. I think also someone else of us, anyway there are also some friend who still attend the last year at school.\n\nGiuseppe\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-15 21:27:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:26.068594", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 339, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31878, "user_id": 1438, "topic_id": 2766, "post_number": 26, "raw": "<b>I'm in :-)</b>\n\nty @Ben, I want to join! not possible this thursday but hopefully next ones :-)", "created_at": "2014-04-29 20:00:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:55.276796", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88180, "user_id": 3206, "topic_id": 15013, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Morning :slight_smile: \n\nMy basic assumption would be fear, as that is mostly used to control people. Fear of migrants, fear of \"decadence of their society\", of \"the enemy\"...there are always enemies. Fear is way stronger than the feeling they get when some politician is making money on the side or indulging in some \"immoral\" activities, even if that politician is preaching against those very same \"immoral\" activities. So I don't think it doesn't bother them...it's more a trade off.\nNobody who has no personal integrity will certainly get my vote, nor will I do business with such a person. This is a clear case of no personal integrity. \n\nThe horrible thing today is, in so many countries you don't get the option even of voting for someone with personal integrity. Or you do but you have to dig deep to find that person as it is buried first under a media blackout, then under a pile of crap they shit on that person. In Croatia those people get very low %. US elections being the prime example of that no choice basically. Trump or Hillary, then Trump or Biden? Unbelievable! I know they just represent the systems and power structure behind them, but it still tells us a lot.\nThe worst thing I hear in Balkans over the last 5 years is \"ah so what he is stealing money and making huge personal gains, it's normal. I would have done the same!\". That indicates a huge moral degradation of the society and shows the acceptance of the state in which they are...a form of Stockholm syndrome as far as I am concerned.\nI believe we have to be extremely patient to bring about change. The lifestyles people live nowadays make that hard as they are buried under huge pile of useless or false information and they lead busy lives. Or not busy but have a perception of being very busy due to this huge amount of crap dumped on them+bad management of time.\nThat said, due to the very same technology being available to us, it is possible to simultaneously reach way more people than it was ever before.

A tentative wrapup of this thread</b>\n\nOk guys, here's what I understood:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>OpenCare studies community-driven care services. This means \"activities of giving care to people that need it, and that are open to anyone's participation\" (Ezio's A1). For example: the Helliniko Community Clinic.</li>\n\n<li>Our attention is on <em>how</em>\u00a0these things come into being. This means we are focusing on the design choices of their protagonists and to the emergent social dynamics driving them (Ezio's B2).\u00a0For example, we consider how the design move of\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0incorporating enabled the Helliniko Community Clinic to work like it does. This is all set against an institutional backdrop. Example: liability for doctors in Greece is attached to the doctors themselves, whereas in Sweden it is attached to the hospitals.</li>\n\n<li>This is all a bit too abstract to prompt an online conversation, so we start by looking at community driven care activities in three domains: social/health care to refugees; suicide prevention; and treatment of dementia (<a href=\"/opencare/suicide-prevention-dementia-refugee-health-please-validate\">more</a>).\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIs that clearer now? Do you all agree? @Ezio_Manzini, I am particularly interested in your say. Here's why: at this point of my thinking, I am seeing design as the main discipline from which to cast our aspirational high-impact publication. I do not think anymore we (i.e. \"society\") can \"solve\" the crisis in health and social care, like a mathematician would be tempted to do. Nor do I think we can \"optmise\" for it \u2013 this is how an economist would go about it. But I do think we can make a <em>move</em> towards higher grounds in the fitness landscape; and moves is what designers do.\u00a0\n\nBut, if you (or the others) are not convinced, then it's back to the drawing board. I agree with you that we need to be on the same page here.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-21 16:17:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:41.564741", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 350, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45790, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 8764, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Thanks Alex.

Where I'm going with this is: you are talking about human relationships here. I don't believe you can solve this issue by shaping the unMonastery <em>project</em>: I think unMonasterians <em>themselves</em> must be prepared to engage almost physically with the local people,\u00a0and indeed curious to meet them, work with them, laugh with them, get drunk with them.

Interface is exactly this: relating to the community. It could be as simple as weekly common meals, or playing football or chess or what have you. Interface is supposed to facilitate the relationship as well as to provide useful information to the more hands-on projects. Better start planning for it, Matt: your own project requires\u00a0<em>very</em> active collaboration from the locals.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-05-26 17:52:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:08.724086", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 236, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21292], "is_liked_by": [5, 84], "is_private": false}, {"id": 77429, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 13542, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Przeczytanie twojej historii zaj\u0119\u0142o mi troch\u0119 czasu, musia\u0142em j\u0105 przet\u0142umaczy\u0107, poniewa\u017c nie m\u00f3wi\u0119 po polsku.\nDzi\u0119kuj\u0119 bardzo za to osobiste do\u015bwiadczenie!\nWychowa\u0142em si\u0119 w postkomunistycznej Rumunii i mog\u0119 sobie wyobrazi\u0107 moich dziadk\u00f3w w twojej historii o alkoholikach i kobietach, kt\u00f3re wol\u0105 by\u0107 uciszone.

I'm Kei, a writer, artist, and programmer, and I submitted a proposal for unMonastery in Matera 2014. In response to a few questions I've received regarding my application, I am posting the answers \"out loud,\" hoping to\u00a0initate\u00a0a dialogue around the project's viability.\n\nWhile I will answer specific questions below, a project outline and excerpted questions from my application can be read here:\u00a0<a href=\"http://pastebin.com/zxTA3ixz\">http://pastebin.com/zxTA3ixz</a>.\n\nThe computer science course I propose would ideally, I think, have between 4-10 students. I set 10 as the limit because it is the largest number of students I have taught independently that still provides\u00a0a substantial amount of individual instruction. If more than 10 individuals take interest, however, I would brainstorm how to reorganize lesson plans so as to maximize my availability as an instructor\u2014as well as, hopefully, recruit interest from fellow unMonasterians.\n\nAs far as finding students for the course, I would first look to techniques I've employed as an independent tutor to find students: postings, including flyers\u00a0at local institutions as well as on online, social platforms, and word of mouth. Since I've been following the unMonastery co-design sessions, it seems Matera residents and unMonastery collaborators meet the project with enthusiasm, so I would like to use the \"institution\"/\u00a0project as a means to make personal connections in the community and cultivate interest for the course.

The city of Ghent used the theory of transition management to create a strong group (\u201carena\u201d) to start reflecting on the future.

When experimenting with Living street the initiators have to find appropriate places for their cars to park. Not just 'around the corner'. We look for under-used parking spaces at shops, companies, railwaystations, ... This can be in the neighborhood or even more remote at 'long distance parkings'. Each time citizens (on a volunteering basis) test this new way of parking and are supported by our network through (e)-bikes, bus/tramtickets, ...

Translators please read this</b>\n\nHi all. It turns out that there is a bug in Amara: if you make changes to the original subtitles (English, in our case), this breaks the connection between them and any translation started before making the changes. Amara has wiki functionalities, so you can undo changes to the original subtitles by reverting to the previous revision; but this will not un-break the connection. Result: people working on translations don't see anymore the English subtitles as they input the translations. The implications is that translators would work instead by playing a little bit of the video, then write the translation down, then move on to the next etcetera. Unfortunately, I did make such changes to get rid of two ugly-looking empty subtitle lines. Sorry!\u00a0The bug was noticed one year ago and acknowledged by Amara, but never solved.\u00a0\n\nGood news: completed translations are not affected \u2013 subtitles display as normal. At the time of writing we have complete translations in English, Estonian, Greek, Italian, Romanian, Russian and Spanish. Also, new translations are not affected: you can follow Noemi's instructions at the beginning of this thread and they will work as normal.\u00a0\n\nWho <i>is\u00a0</i>affected is people working on the four in-progress translations: French (me), German (Lorenzo, who has no Edgeryders account), Polish ([Justyna Krol]) and\u00a0Portuguese ([pacheca]). Here's how you can solve this:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>if you prefer to translate by listening to Ben speaking (some people do), there is no change. Amara's interface lets you do that.</li>\n\n<li>if you prefer to translate by looking at the English subtitles, start by creating a new translation in some language that you don't think will be used or some regional variant of the main language \u2013 I used French Canadian for French.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>translate as normal. If you have already done a part of the work, start at the first untranslated line \u2013 no need to redo the work!</li>\n\n<li>when you are done, subtitles need to be moved back into the main language. The simplest way is probably to open two browser tabs next to each other, one for the source language (in my case French Canadian) and the other for the target language (in my case, French). Once the target language is marked complete, it will show up as a playback option\u00a0in the video.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>", "created_at": "2013-12-06 14:07:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:58.588660", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 421, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24944, "user_id": 52, "topic_id": 1477, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>I know the Rivolta and I agree with you</b>\n\nCiao Davide!

What about CF Learning by Doing/Doing by Learning Session - is it a part of upskilling track or the unconf track?

At the same time the outcome of this session will be\u00a0ready to start\u00a0CF campaign for LOTE4.\u00a0\n\nSo my 3\u00a0questions before I \"add a track\" to <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/tracks\">track proposals</a>\u00a0are:\n\n- Should the CF Session\u00a0be added to track proposals or tasks first?\n\n- Which track of the 3 it fits the best?\n\n- Is description of tracks on <a href=\"/t/lote3/312/participate\">participate page</a>\u00a0is the same thing as the description of tracks on the <a href=\"/t/lote3/312/program\">program page</a> described in slightly different words or these are two completely different things.\u00a0\n\nAfter I \"add a track\" or rather \"add a session proposal which fits one of the 3 tracks\" I'll ping Petros and <a href=\"/u/justyna_krol\">Justyna</a>.

Sort of. But this is optional. Sorry for a vague language of the original post. I'm trying my best to be less vague in comments. \n\nExample: (bear with me, I'm trying to figure out what the Form Storm can be, I just have a hunch about it being a good thing we can do and that ER has features enabling us to do that)\n\nER X has a project she's been working on that needs funding. There is a call for applications which fit this project. Deadline is set.\n\nWould it be benefitial for X to participate to the Form Storm?\n\n* to get constructive critisism, advice and peer review\n* to find buddies if there is bigger capacity/scale needed.\n* to just simply have a specific timeframe to get stuff done, because FormStorm is an event fixed in time.\n\nER O has rather raw idea which sort of could be turned into actionable, but not quite enough for a project, more of an element. O joins a Form Storm and the Xs project seems like this O's element can be modified and added to the application. ER Y and Z have no ideas or projects at the moment, but bloody good at reading text and looking for key words and being consistent and gone through similar process few times in the past. N is a freaking optimist and full of courage. N also has other special skill which can be useful in a Form Storm. Whatever. It might be something else.

It would be expensive (one VPS is 15-40 EUR a month depending on resources needed, same for Docker images at Digital Ocean).\n\n3.

No thinking of the whole community \u201c\n\n**Hajeur**:\u201dThe background of the society: we are a new society that is trying to discover itself, we are Bedouins so even the bureaucratic of this region is new, we still have a weird communication style, and tribes are taking control over the city.. we need to work on the civil society ,because it is helping us to communicate more\u2026 this is why we don\u2019t know how to share exactly, because we don\u2019t really understand each other: My card is: I am not able to choose one over one, but I will talk about economy because we need more investments, government\u2019s attention, the culture which is important in sharing and know how to communicate and separate objectivity from subjectivity, focus on communication, and to create a balanced economy and culture where we need to know how to co-live with our own selves\u2026\u201d\n\n**Nidhal**: \u201dThe mentality in Medenine misses the innovation, you will always have someone giving negative feedbacks; we only repeat each other\u2019s projects, and second: we lack good communication skills\nBecause in such an opportunity such as the workshop, we are enabled to discover each other, since we are used to judging other people without even knowing them\u201d\n\n**Ines**:\u201d The problematic in Medenine, lack of entertainment tools, Job, Study \u2026 and even if there was a movement in the society but it still missing a lot of work!

(Ali: we want a small output of it, and not necessarily money) and I chose personal activities and initiatives: when we ask our colleagues to volunteer they refuse to do so, they don\u2019t want to take initiatives.. also the activities in the volunteering work has a huge impact over the human being, when seeing its procedure of how it is helping people or a certain workshop (Anes: It changes the way we see things \u201c\n\n**Mohamed** :\u201cInformation exchange, the world now is based on information so we need to know which information we need and which we don\u2019t, and how to share it.\nTransparency: people don\u2019t know how to be transparent with each other, we envy each other we don\u2019t communicate\nEmployment and work: I am unemployed since two years, I want to learn how to work, and if I didn\u2019t find a job I will launch my business;\u201d\n \n**Haykel**: \u201cI chose my card without thinking of anyone else,  when I finished my college, I had no activities so I wanted to change that and I thought of taking part of what is happening and I started an association with my friends where we met a lot of people and foreign ones, we were moving all over the world, and in Medenine we were called different bad names and descriptions\u2026 but I learned from that, and then I felt I have enough knowledge and skills in multimedia and audio-visuals, and I always participate in different workshops in all over Tunisia, I pay for getting knowledge and I am happy for that and I shared my knowledge unlike the people in here who don\u2019t want to share such things usually! Friends were a good thing in my life they helped me get different opportunities, it is where I got my opportunity: an organisation that gives funding for entrepreneurs.so I won a fund and I started my project and the work started from the community I had from the civil society\u2026\nHowever, at a certain time I stopped working on civil society because it was all over the place and we had a lot of them since 2013 they were a lot of associations that it turned into ineffective ones, ( we had some who were professionals, and it was good, but then it turned into a business \u2026 during this time, I started to participate in programs that reinforce my skills and capacity .. and now we are working a new association that works on entrepreneurship, culture and art.\n\n**Zaineb**: \u201cI also thought of myself: I chose the family, friends, relationships, self improvement, family and friends are my major support; as for the self-improvement is about how to change myself to change our reality\nI can relate to all what they have said, but the most important said thing is the will to change the city and the country and I do believe in that.\u201d\nAnes :\u201d I want to discover new things and hear what people think, I want to be present in everything, in the high school there is an average demand for such workshops and activities, I discovered the civil society myself and I loved to participate in it, but my family want me to focus in my studies.\nThe time I have now it will never be back, so I want to learn as much as I can.\u201d", "created_at": "2017-10-11 21:39:44.039955", "updated_at": "2017-10-11 21:41:30.535173", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1713, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 558.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4088, 4094, 4085], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22843, "user_id": 899, "topic_id": 1484, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Hi Amalia</b>\n\nWe went today in court but for an extra row in one of the papers we were delayed untill 23 of august, when we have to bring another paper to explain that extra row.

So here you are with :love_letter:\n\n\n## Tools covered in second \"art of communication\" session:\n\n**\"CHECK-IN\"**\n\n* There are many types of check-ins.\n\n* For example, you can invite people to respond to a specific question relevant to what you will be exploring - this is what we used on Day 1 when I asked everyone to share what communication was to them.\n\n* Another type is where you simply invite everyone in a session to go around and share where they are at in one word as a means to come together.\n\n* Some people also use visual check-ins where people draw an experience or how they are - for example: how did you all arrive to the session that day.\n\n**\"CONCEPTUAL SPEED DATING\"** (also known as other names)\n\n* This is where the group is divided into \"posts\" (people who stay where they are) and \"flows\" (people who move).\n\n* A question is posed, a theme/ concept selected or a text can be used as a discussion item. In our case it was _how do you normally address a problem?_ Other examples I have used are _the concept of understanding_ or a text from a book.\n\n* A time period is chosen - usually this is around 2 - 5mins.\n\n* Posts and flows join into pairs and share their perspectives on the question/ concept/ text. After the time period finishes they move onto another.\n\n* I've been involved in sessions where this continued for an hour but that would be the limit I think. Normally there it goes well if there is a collective discussion afterwards.\n\n**\"ORIENTATION CIRCLE\"** (made-up name)\n\n* This is the tool I spontaneously incorporated because of how people were bringing up orientation around how they face problems. \n\n* It is the one I learned from the [Design Studio for Social Intervention](http://ds4si.org/) (the agency I spoke of who were incubated in MIT's urban engagement department).\n\n* One person stands in the middle of a circle and says one word that is relevant to what is being explored. The group then moves closer to the person or further away depending on how they relate and orientate to this word.\n\n* For example in our session I chose words like Medenine, an Arab woman, empowerment, innovation.\n\n**\"CHARETTE\"**\n\n* This is a tool that emerged from architecture and was one of the earlier participatory techniques used with communities to get their input and ideas on development projects.\n\n* There are many different types and forms - I encourage you to research it and find them.\n\n* The form I've been involved in is as follows. There are groups of four people each who are considering a particular issue. The exercise example I offered involves four rounds of approximately 5-10minutes each round.\n\n*1. The first step is each person writes down their **big vision or idea about the issue**. In our case we used OurGhema as an example of a big vision idea to respond to rural womens' empowerment.\n*2. After 5-10 minutes they hand this paper onto the person next to them. This person then writes **the list of ingredients** that would be necessary for to make that idea possible. For example, a lease for a co-working space, women interested and available etc.\n*3. After 5-10 minutes they hand this paper onto the person next to them. This person then writes the actions that would be required to turn the ingredients into a tasty dish ;-) . For example, approach local real-estate owners to get a lease, connect with womens' groups in rural areas etc. \n*4. After 5-10 minutes they hand this paper onto the person next to them. This person then writes the news story that would be aired once the project launches and is a success. This is a bit of fun and gives people a sense of what it would be like if the project actually happened. The groups then all share their news stories at the end.\n\n**\"REPETITIVE QUESTIONING\"** (also known as the \"chaplain\" technique)\n\n* This is the technique that I learned from my colleague and friend who is studying at Harvard Religion/ Theology School.\n\n* It has been useful for me in getting to the depth of certain assumptions behind problems, in particular for those working on them and not necessarily the beneficiaries.\n\n* It's as simple as a pair of people where one is **the listener** and the other **the sharer.**\n\n* The pair agree on the question to be asked and the time limit - consent is important because the process can be quite confronting. For example, the case we used was me asking @Yosser _what is women's empowerment?_ \n\n* The listener then asks the sharer the question. The sharer responds until they have no more to say. The listener **never responds, just listens**. When the sharer has no more to say the listener simply asks the same question again. The sharer responds. When the sharer has no more to say the listener simply asks the same question again. This continues until the time limit is up - usually around 10mins but can be longer.\n\n**\"PRODUCTIVE FICTIONS\"**\n\n* This is another technique I have learned from the Design Studio for Social Intervention (DS4SI). They use it a lot as a part of their [creativity labs](http://www.ds4si.org/creativity-labs) where they consult with communities, civil society organisations, government etc... This has often been with socially-excluded communities (les communaut\u00e9s defavoris\u00e9s) on infrastructure and access.\n\n* It's as simple as imagining - almost role-playing - if an thing was there. This then gives the people would be served by that thing a chance to share what they would need it to be.\n\n* The example I used was a bus stop. On thinking about if a bus stop was on your street you might share, well I would need it to have a timetable... and a ramp for a pram ... a shelter because it rains a lot here etc. \n\n**\"PARADOX CARDS\"**\n\n* These are the cards I left with @zmorda that were gifted to us by our friends at [Namahn](http://namahn.com/), a design studio in Brussels.\n\n* These and other cards - like the Method Kit cards @nadia used in her workshops and also now with Zmorda - can be useful in thinking through complex problems and considering factors and pathways.\n\n**THE GOLDEN CIRCLE**\n\n* This is the significant approach to communications that Simon Sinek shared in 2010 and has gone on to inform many leaders and communicators. \n\n* We watched the essence of the approach in [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5Tw0PGcyN0). I encourage you to watch the whole TED talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4).\n\n\n## A couple of example communication plan formats\n\nHere are two different outlines that might assist you in coming up with a communications plan. They are what I've come up with based on my experiences and I encourage you to do more research to develop one that will work for you. \n\n**HIGH LEVEL PATHWAY**\n\n* I have used this in a kind of workshop capacity with a client who was running an independent radio show and magazine. She needed help on thinking through how long term sustainability. These are the questions we brainstormed around to consider opportunities around marketing and fundraising. \n* Why\n* Influences\n* Character/ expression/ posture/ stride\n* Collaborators/ communities/ resources/ supporters\n* Audiences\n* Marketing platforms\n* Impact/ legacy\n* Roadmap\n\n**MARKETING PLAN**\n\n* This is a mix of categories that I have come up with after collaborating on various high profile projects for my own marketing plans.\n* Current situation/ rationale\n* Vision - This is the biggest, longest-ranging look at how the project positively affects the world\n* Mission - This is fundamentally, at the most basic level, what the project seeks to do\n* Values - Think in terms of impact not implementation - These will inform decision-making (such as accessibility) - Consider \u201ccore competencies\u201d \n* SWOT - Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats. Doing a SWOT can be very useful however there are now new techniques that emerging that address complexity better and I necourage you to research them.)\n* OFFER\n* Format and themes of offer - eg. OurGhema\n* Brand identity - the who behind the offer - personable, authentic as per @noemi workshop \n* Target audiences\n* Partners\n* Key messages\n* Platforms\n* Marketing outcomes\n* Risk management\n* Evaluation\n* Budget \n* Timeline\n\nIt has been an honour and a pleasure to connect and collaborate with each and all of you.

It\u2019s something to hide complexity, at the cost of efficiency and cost. And in production, efficiency and cost do matter.\n[/quote]\n\nOh, absolutely. But let's face it, Matt: we won't be in production with this top-of-stack analytical software for the foreseeable time. The methodology is still young. It draws on the advancements of a young discipline, network science. I don't recommend investing in \"hardening\" the tech. The requirements of researchers will keep shifting for some time.\n\nWhat I do recommend is this. When we have a project, we pull up a virtual machine, we keep it going for the duration of the project + 6 months, then we save it and archive it somewhere. We bill costs + freshening up of the virtual machine _to the project_, not to core. Think OpenCare: we would now have an undead docker image stashed away on zenodo.org, not running and therefore costing nothing. If someone wants to go back to it, we simply resurrect it, and wham!\n\nWe can think of more complicated (and stable) ways. For example, we could have _only one_ Neo running on edgeryders.eu, and all the data from all the projects could end up in there. This would mean (I think) that the Python API would have a long query:\n\n```\ndata = requests.get(project1_data + project2_data + ... projectN_data)\n```\nThen, on top of it you could have multiple Graphryders. Or could you? Certainly you could not have ONE single Graphryder to filter, because `sigma.js` is not that far from hitting its limit. \n\nBut if we are not sure this would work, or we are not sure it would be a long term solutions, I would embrace \"perpetual beta\".

After a 3 year period of professional and personal \u201cfailures\u201d I found motivation in exploring alternative working methods. I was referred to LOTE3 by an ex-colleague and made my decision to come after a presentation by Michel Bauwens. Peer to Peer was completely new to me and I wanted to experience first hand what it was all about.\u00a0\n\nMy experience was not positive nor negative. Mainly because of my own insecurities and uncertainties. Over the last 2 years I have made steps into self-employment on my own paste. The Peer to Peer philosophy has been a significant contribution to this. Now I would like to come and experience this again with a fresh pair of eyes.\u00a0\n\nI want to learn and help others learn as well.

This is indeed much better to discuss in writing, as I needed a day to think it through. I would not have had any proposal yesterday.\n\n[quote=\"owen, post:1, topic:14748\"]Is Slack the right platform[/quote]\n\nFirst of all, let me talk you out of using Slack. Not only is Slack the most sluggish, inefficient and bloated of the six web-based chat tools that I have open all the time. It is also not open source, and not frictionless for people who are not on the platform. Because they need an account on our Slack (let's say edgeryders.slack.com), even if they already have one or more other Slack accounts. And if they are going to need a new account anyway, they could just as well have made one on our Discourse platform.\n\nAlso I think that we should look for a more general solution than \"just\" being able to post Slack transcripts to Discourse. It should be applicable, with little work, to any chat tool; of which we use several already. For example, when community managers hold a webinar in Zoom or Google Meet, the chat among the audience might contain relevant content, and we'd want an edited transcript on Discourse.\n\nBelow is my proposal how such a solution could be created technically. (But I have no idea how this could be funded: there is zero IT budget left for new features. Which should not be a surprise, given how underfunded IT has been for the current H2020 projects \u2026)\n\n\n## Generic Chat Transcript Import for Discourse\n\nHere's how my proposed solution would be used, from chat to coding in Open Ethnographer:\n\n1. People chat, in any tool. Could be Zoom, Google Meet, Matrix / Element, Slack, Rocket Chat, even Google Docs comments. The only requirement is that one can copy & paste the chat messages in text or HTML format, and that a filter has been defined in the transcript import for that particular chat application. Note that both Matrix / Element and Rocket chat support chat room access by users without having to create an account, providing the frictionless experience you're looking for.\n\n2. After the event or chat session is over, somebody goes to Discourse and clicks <kbd>+ New Topic</kbd>. Same as when posting anything else to Discourse.\n\n3. In the Discourse editor, they now click \":gear: \u2192 Import Chat Transcript\". A wizard dialog opens, which is possible in Discourse (compare \":gear: \u2192 Create Poll\" right now).\n\n4. In the dialog, they now select the chat platform to import from, and copy & paste the chat transcript, possibly in multiple parts if only a few sections are relevant to post.\n\n5. In the next step of the wizard dialog, the system will show a list of detected usernames, each with a box behind to select a corresponding Discourse username (if any).\n\n6. In the next step, the wizard dialog will disappear and leave the user with a draft of a chat transcript inside the Discourse editor. Similar to what happens when using the Discourse / Slack integration to post to Discourse, as seen in [this video](https://vimeo.com/266031792).\n\n    Notably, the transcript will use the usual Discourse quote formatting to attribute chat messages to users (such as `[quote=\"username\"]\u2026[/quote]`). It will *not* create one Discourse post for every chat message. Usernames would correspond to Discourse usernames where a mapping has been provided, and otherwise would use a special prefix such as `chatuser_`.\n\n    Posting each chat message as a Discourse post is not a good idea because Discourse posts are meant to be longer. Many short chat messages will lead to a lot of notification spam, and also many users would have to be created who would never come and post anything in person on Discourse, thus cluttering the database.\n\n7. The user posting the transcript can edit the draft at will (shortening, fixing spelling and grammar, editing out personal data etc.) and would then post this as a new topic to Discourse. It can serve as a conversation starter, allowing other Discourse users to add their own posts as usual.\n\n8. When coding in Open Ethnographer, ethnographers would code the transcript as usual, just making sure that annotations use text from one quote only.\n\n    For this to work, we would extend Open Ethnographer so that it recognizes that the text is in a quote, and would record this into the database attributed to the quoted user. It would thus show up properly in the network analysis, just that some usernames would not be linked to Discourse users.\n\nAs a nice side effect, this solution will also enable the ethnographic coding of video call transcripts. It's just about manually creating a post made from quotes, in analogy to what the chat transcript importer would generate. This also means that only the Open Ethnographer extension is crucial to start with posting chat transcripts to Discourse, since adding the `[quote=\"\u2026\"]\u2026[/quote]` syntax can also be done manually during a test period. Still, the Open Ethnographer extension would be 2000\u20134000 EUR, and better at the upper end because we need to use some more solid programming techniques from now on to keep Open Ethnographer more stable, as it's becoming too complex for \"just adding something here and there\".\n\nOver to @amelia and @nadia for deliberation.\n\n[quote=\"owen, post:2, topic:14748\"]it would be possible to create a web application, sort of how [now.edgeryders.eu](http://now.edgeryders.eu) [\u2026] worked, with a chat export feature. This would be no small job though[/quote]\n\nI liked the chat export idea for the now.edgeryders.eu video call application; it had login integration with Discourse anyway, so attributing the transcript properly was easier that way. However, let's not reinvent the wheel I'd say: creating a chat application with the frictionless UX desired here is a lot of work, which others did already. Also, having our own chat application still would not allow to utilize the transcripts from Zoom, Google Meet etc..", "created_at": "2020-11-07 15:14:07.565492", "updated_at": "2020-11-07 15:14:07.565492", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1018, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 36.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [86349, 86354], "is_reply_to": [86349, 86354], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2183, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2150, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi Everyone,\u00a0\n\nhope this message finds you well and rested post lote3 :)\n\nEveryone did an amazing job of coming together and making it happen.

I also organizaed debates, prepared publications (eg.https://pl.boell.org/pl/2019/06/07/atlas-rolny-dokad-zmierza-europejska-polityka-rolna ) and ran projects - all meant to make people aware of the importance of of Common Agricultural Policy and stimulate debate and engagement around its reform.

If anyone finds this useful, I can\u00a0try to condense some other impressions and stories from Laos.\n\nI ever only saw one beggar. He was a physically disabled man, unable to stand, having to crawl\u00a0through\u00a0the streets. At different times I saw him receiving food from the small food stalls on the street.\n\nI had befriended\u00a0a local woman, let's call her Babs,\u00a0through a common friend and I asked her about this man. Babs\u00a0immediately knew who I meant. She said that there were not many beggars and homeless people\u00a0in Savannakhet, a city of 120,000 people and second largest city\u00a0in Laos. There used to be many people asking for money on the streets a few years earlier.\u00a0Most of them came from large, poor\u00a0families outside the city. One or two family members would go to the city to beg and send some money back home. Recently, the local government chased those people away back to the rural areas.\n\nThe\u00a0reasoning was\u00a0that the families\u00a0were able to sustain themselves growing crops on their small piece of land, so they should not come begging in the city. Responsibility to take care of each other rests\u00a0on\u00a0the family. This is the situation for most of the Lao: they can sustain themselves but they have almost nothing more and live in poverty. Begging in the city is one of the ways out.\n\nBabs said that now, there only remain a few homeless people\u00a0who have mental or physical disabilities and no family to rely on. In other words, those who have no other options.

Urban planning proper is politically loaded, because zoning choices and the like shift a lot of money around. Opening up the process, while it could certainly generate a lot of brilliant ideas, is also likely to ignite conflict. Also, and critically, the legals are much less clear in town design than they are in the software world, where brilliant lawyers have developes an array of licenses to enable sharing in the sense you describe.\n\nThat said, in many countries a variant of British project <a href=\"http://www.fixmystreet.com\">Fixmystreet</a> has been implemented.

Fixmystreet knows the names and email addresses of every public official in charge of street maintenance in the country, so it informs her of the problem. You, the citizen, can also track the resolution of the issue you have flagged. This is now a fairly standard tool in the Open Government toolbox.\n\nThere are also more creative approaches to what you describe.

This is a completely untested wild eyed idea - so please use your own brain if you attempt this! But it is perhaps better than letting the food rot under a leaky roof or having some pest get at it.\n\nWhat you do is run a thin pilot line over the roof if and make sure you have something to support it with eventually (like a big tree, a very long beam, or perhaps two fixed together). Then you take the next thicker rope (should be able to carry two persons) and tie it to the end of the thin pilot line and pull that over. Lastly you do the same thing with the most heavy duty cordage you can get your hands on. Probably something like a modern fire hose will work nicely. Now you basically have an over-sized temporary clothesline installed across the roof. You should make sure it is well secured and probably have a bunch of people stand at the ready in case something goes wrong. You probably want to have some anchoring pegs with you but perhaps a tree, a jeep, or even a lot of people can do the job as well. The rest is relatively obvious, on light guy gets secured with the medium thickness rope, slides over the roof picks up the sheeting and ties it to another rope that is thrown over the heavy duty one, and is operated by a team of people on the ground. They lower first the sheeting and then the stores carefully to the ground next to the house, while they keep an eye and ear on the structure.\n\nIn the following image I could see this being used effectively. You could tie some bamboo to the tree to get higher, perhaps build a Y-fork. If you have a lot of rope you have good chances of finding a high enough tree on the other side. <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.communityserviceofnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sindhupalchok-6.jpg\">\n\nOf course it won't work always and everywhere, but having extra cordage in your jeep in a place like Nepal is usually not a bad idea. You could bring extra pilot lines so people can prep several sites at once and you can get to the next place faster. Dental floss is typically 50m long, pretty strong and weighs nothing. Of course fishing line will work as well.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-17 13:17:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:18.060202", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 450, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23885], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16805, "user_id": 1629, "topic_id": 2184, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Governance, the UnMonastery and Scripture</b>\n\nI'd like to pick up on this thread about governance. It's a core interest of mine, and it is something I plan to pick up on with regard to the forthcoming UnMonastery Residency. I presented the Liquid law project I am involved with at \\#LOTE3, and I'm one of the founders of Liquid Democracy mayhem - though my focus shifted to the problem of facilitation and space a decade ago. I think we have a chance to investigate these issues now in the context of the UnMonastery without rocking the boat too much with regards to the existing EdgeRyders constitutional forms.\n\nFirst a personal note - I fell in love with EdgeRyders literally and figuratively. I'm dead keen on the people and the aims. The method is pretty damn fine as well. There are a bunch of reasons why I have not been as involved as I would have naturally liked to, and one of the big ones is the legal form. I may be a nerd in this area, and yet I firmly believe that the structure is both a major philisophical problem, a significant and subtle community problem, and is damaging to creating a sustainable business plan for EdgeRyders.\n\nI'd like to provoke a discussion about these issues, in a constructive, and facilitated way throughout the unMonastery Residency in Matera - from March till end of May, and structure these discussions in a creative format of live radio, and live TV discusssions, coupled to a coding excersize that we call liquid law - or scripture. If there are any EdgeRyders interested in this space - and I am sure there are - decision making, constitutions, law, and facilitation then please comment here, and we can get in touch to structure a series of live discussions?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-02-05 13:06:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.993610", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 309, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [82], "is_private": false}, {"id": 89085, "user_id": 6484, "topic_id": 14626, "post_number": 32, "raw": "[quote=\"SZdenek, post:31, topic:14626\"]\nWhen solving the codes with asterisks, I should do the changes both in the google spreadsheet and the back-end, right?\n[/quote]\nYeah, please do that.\n\n[quote=\"SZdenek, post:31, topic:14626\"]\nAbout this Friday.

For example I remember the story about Rustavi's participatory budgeting and Revaz's enthusiasm to be involved in implementation. However, there is more to learn about the outcomes of it - for example, in Cluj where I live they ran a 3 step process starting from the neighborhood level. But it involved a lot of deliberation - as Alberto was writing above, that means showing up at neighborhood meetings (physical). They nonetheless got to testing it at the city level, but a lot of the energy got dissipated in sending in <a href=\"http://cc.yourcluj.ro/index.php/votes/list_initiatives\">proposals to compete for online votes\u00a0(&gt;400</a>\u00a0projects)! and ending up funding very few with little money (1000 eur per winning project - about 50 of them).\u00a0 I don't want to think of the amount that went into the administration of it, but you see where this goes. That was in 2014-2015, no news since, and more importantly, it's unclear whether it was considered successful or not in order to move further in an upgraded version. Anyway, this is just an example.. \u00a0hope Rustavi will do much better, but also that people running it are considering risks too.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-25 15:49:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:50.502796", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 265, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30886], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13656, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2228, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Links...</b>\n\nI think it could benefit from \"learn more\" (or similar) links.

The part about social / cultural / economic compatibility is especially relevant, and true of course. It would be valuable to co-design a culturally informed approach for Romania with you, starting from the <a href=\"/t/food-supply-unchained/553/concept-with-farmers-markets\">updated Epelia concept</a>. (We know that this is too much to ask as a favor, but we'll come back to you once deploying the idea in Romania is imminent and Epelia is ready to put some cash into this.) The new concept relies on farmers' markets, and thus should easier adapt to local circumstances, as basically all regions have their own farmers' markets, in a way that works for them ...\n\nNoemi is right that this idea is more about supporting small producers economically rather than perfect sustainability. And where a region has so much agriculture that it supplies for more than the locally needed food, local marketing of that food is not the full solution to supporting small-scale farmers. I think the natural idea is trading with other regions \u2013 much more sustainable at least than using the food for biofuels ... .\n\nBut you're right about transport being inherently unsustainable. To different degrees though: transporting basic foods means high transport volumes and costs and just makes no sense. Transporting foods with a high price per volume ratio (like spices, liqueurs, mature cheeses etc.) needs much less transport volume, making only as much a waste of resources as the fact that these semi-luxury foods exist at all ... . I mean. while the low-volume transport could even be made sustainable (trains powered by renewables anyone?), the fact of producing gourmet cheeses in a world of 1.3 billion hungry people is absurd in itself.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-02-17 11:17:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:39.503771", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 306, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28049], "is_liked_by": [3811], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29018, "user_id": 1487, "topic_id": 2246, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Epelia</b>\n\n\"Gourmet cheese\" is a great example ... what is considered gourmet in Germany vs. Romania? What is considered gourmet in a Romanian city vs. a Romanian village? What is considered gourmet in Bucharest (largest city in Romania) vs. in a smaller city/town?\n\nOur objective has been from the start to go for the simple and basic things ... healthy, fresh day-to-day food. We are constantly trying to encourage the producers to diversify ... but anything that is too \"gourmet\" is ultimately rejected (either to costly to produce or to expensive for people to buy).\n\nIf I set aside the \"internationality\" aspect of it (though I would be quite happy to purchase even my olive oil directly from a Portugese peasant then from a store) ... then I am behind you a hundred percent.\n\nI developed the information system that drives our project out of necessity. I am not a very good developer nor I do like doing it. If I were asked to deploy it for another country/culture ... I probably could not (or doing so would require more effort than I could provide). So it would be great if there was an open-source platform that enabled forging direct producer-to-consumer relationships to encourage local production. I would be happy to retire my code for a better, more stable, more robust and more standard open-source platform that does this.\n\nIf that is the objective then I would recommend, from the start, realizing that we cannot model an \"application\" for this. Specific application choices are bound to create cultural/contextual friction. I would aim for a framework that can be configured/extended/adapted ... kind of like WordPress does for blogging.\n\nI think it could be very valuable to gather experiences from people who already have experience with such projects on the ground in different countries/cultures. To get a perspective of what aspects are shared and what aspects are unique. That may help in identifying core capabilities around which a platform could be built.\n\nIf there are developers committed to doing this I'd be happy to partake by both sharing my experience here in Romania, helping shape the overal research dynamic and design of the platform.\n\nI've looked at Epelia but everything seems to be in German.

It is a common misunderstanding to assume that Marx had a deterministic view (\"the knell of capitalist private property sounds!\"), but he had a more dynamic vision, where the knell faces other opposing forces (e.g. counter-tendencies in his jargon). So I think Goodwin was fundamentally right in his interpretation. \n\nSo your idea is to use the same Lotka-Volterra reasoning with two other \"opposing\" forces, not employment vs output share, but leisure vs work, for example.

That's a major architectural decision, which might not be possible to adjust later without rewriting the whole software. So they really poured their values into their software. In comparison, politics is not yet good at getting its values implemented into technological developments. So we need a better process that implements our values into our technology. It's about a process strong in accountability.\n\n* **What is human?** If an actor (any party / organization) says they are human centric, they often do not even define what \"human centric\" means in their case. For example, \"human\" in \"European human centric Internet\" is left undefined. This generates conflict potential, as it stays so general.\n\n* **The economics behind AI.** There's an interesting study of \"the cost of developing a universal chips after the end of Moore's law\". It means that now that we're at the end of Moore's law, the money sunk into developing faster chips is unlikely to come back. So instead the industry took a risk by developing *specialized* chips. There are two main types of such chips: AI and blockchain. That's the only reason why AI became a hype and we're talking about it: it is pushed on us, because industry needed a new profitable outlet for investments, and high levels of capital investment are backing AI already. \"If we are not buying it, it's going to go down. If we are not buying it, we are going to go down.\" We are still in the process of making that choice if we (also: the Commission) want to invest money into AI.\n\n* **Good and bad AI architecture.** Let's differentiate between \"AI for research and solutions\" and \"AI for the production of services\". The first type is benign research aimed to solve intricate problems, for example done by universities. The second type is commercial <abbr title=\"Software as a Service\">SaaS</abbr> software that scoops in data out of profit interest of the company. Maybe Google maps might in the future adapt your routing so that you see adverts of parties that paid Google for audience for these adverts.\n\n    This means: the problem of this  is about the economics of who runs the datacenters: Amazon and Microsoft and Google built \"clouds\", data centers for people to run their applications. Due to economics of scale, they provide the cheapest solution, but also are able to monitor and keep the data going through them. This is an undemocratic process for plain economic reasons, and it's a hard problem to crack.\n\n* **The structure defines the function.** The type of governance structure defines how a new technology gets used. So it may be that we have allowed the wrong governance structures to happen, which will lead to the wrong outcomes of AI technology. In addition, Google and Facebook have been advertising companies but are not anymore \u2013 trying to rule them in as advertisers with regulation is already not applicable anymore, instead we should rule in their new structure of \"AI first\" companies.\n\n* **Is AI anti-human by definition?** What AI (as rebranded Bayesian statistics) does is to put the individual differences between human beings (everyone's \"spark of the divine\") into the epsilon, the error term at the end of the equation. That makes AI non-human-centric by design. Because the definition of human for an individual is \"that which cannot be predicted by AI, which is not part of the 'normal'\".\n\n* **On tech interfering with relationships.** Intermediating the patient-doctor relationship with data collecting and analyzing systems has degraded the value of that relationship. Because medicine is not about diagnosis, but prognosis: improving a patient's future condition, and that is a negotiation with the individual, and that individual might be very much non-average, refusing certain treatments etc., and should have and keep a right to that individualness. That still allows for tech systems that could benefit relationships \u2013 it's just that the tech systems we have currently in medicine do not do that.\n\n\n## Personal reflections\n\nI want to clearly distinguish between systems of exploitation and the technology itself. Any system of exploitation, including capitalism, will find and use *any* new technological option in exploitative ways. The history of digital innovation and media innovation in more general is quite rich in that: before AI for behavior prediction it has been targeted advertising, tracking, mass surveillance programs by governments, weaponized drones, propaganda micro-targeting, mass media use for state propaganda etc..\n\nThat's purely a social problem, not a technological one. Adding one more technology cannot make it much worse \u2026 nukes are already around, so what technology could offer significantly worse potential outcomes? So to deal with it, you don't have to make legislation for AI, but against capitalism.\n\nAI in itself is a nice tool in the toolkit, and easily allows for beneficial use.

Even when I have been offered jobs, unless they are focused on a specific projects in which I have a lot of say in defining what we are to do and how we are to go about getting it done, \u00a0I tend to lose interest quite quickly. \u00a0The roadblocks standing in my way is that I want to realise ideas and approaches, experiment and be able to make mistakes and having \u00a0a \"job\" often means getting paid to do what someone else has decided needs to be done in the way that they want it done.

She gets around. Here is her bio: http://nitibhan.com/about-niti/. Niti is an interesting person with interesting ideas about African informal economies, but she is not African -- she is Indian, went to high school in Kuala Lumpur, college in London plus Bangalore plus Ahmedabad plus Chicago, MBA from Pittsburg, now earning Ph.D. at Aalto Uni in Finland. So very very much global elite. \"Her dissertation topic will cover the adaptation of design methodology for systemically lowering the barriers to adoption of novel technologies in challenging operating environments, particularly the rapidly digitalizing informal economy of sub Saharan Africa.\" What we used to call \"appropriate technology\" when I was an Econ grad student in the 80s -- of course what is available and what is appropriate has changed a lot.\n\nBhan has a TED talk (https://youtu.be/d0a0eXJ5TJM) from Aug 2017 in which she talks about informal traders and the obstacles they encounter. These are not hugely different from small business people and informal service providers in poor areas of American cities, and I suspect of every city. I know something about such businesses in Houston through my students, and they face obstacles that are to some extent comparable -- I cannot agree more that such micro businesses should be assisted in order to release economic potential among the poor -- I have been working on such a project on a very small scale.\n\nThe prepaid economy has to do with having to pay for everything in advance. The chart she showed in a 2014 article states that this model doesn't apply to North America, but I absolutely declare that it does -- only among the poor -- again, this is the way my students live, and those among them who are entrepreneurs operate precisely this way. Finance is a desperate need if we are to unlock this potential, but no one in the United States, including Black-owned businesses, are willing to enter the market -- the margins are too small, the entrepreneurs too unreliable, etc. By the way, among my friends who are in some kind of business who live on Indian reservations in the US (usually handicrafts, from rank amateurs to accomplished artists), the situation is the same.\n\nMuhammad Yunus' Grameen Bank is an attempt to address this problem. I have studied Grameen Bank's work off and on since the 80s, and have an idea which has changed over time. When I first encountered it, I thought it was great -- more recently I think it still only partly addresses this need for business finance. If you are aware of Grameen Bank, it was formed in 1983 to offer very small loans to groups of mostly women -- recent studies suggest that the help it provides mostly does not enable these women to climb to the next stage of business, but only to continue at the original low level, which is very good, but not as transformative as one had hoped.\n\nSo... I have a lot of African students, and I have encountered a number of entrepreneurs, in Russia, China, India, the Middle East, Africa, etc. from poor countries, and thought about how to help them. They are often very very entrepreneurial people -- especially Africans -- they all want a business. Those who do so tend to be government workers who found a business on the side. So thinking about it as I write... it seems to me that the simplest way to do so might be to encourage what already works. This is almost always treated as a problem, as corruption, or as something that prevents the governments from working well (in any given office there tends to be one person plus a secretary who carries the entire load of the function of the office, while everyone else spends 90% of their days pursueing their little business on the side). This view has a fair amount of validity... but if we look at it from the other side, I can say with complete assurance that government offices are the best incubators for entrepreneurs in poor countries -- they provide a stable income that can finance a startup long enough for it to succeed, and give access to resources of people that can be invaluable in setting up a business that would otherwise be impossible.\n\nSo talk to Niti. I would not consider her African really, but as someone who has worked hard on the economic lives of the poor who are outside the formal economy. The people she is looking at are traders, who are, on the income scale, below the office workers with side-jobs I just mentioned, and above the very poor people helped by Grameen Bank. And Heaven knows those people -- all of these people -- need structures and institutions that help them rather than getting in their way and often criminalizing them.", "created_at": "2020-06-25 04:57:51.201047", "updated_at": "2020-06-25 05:01:20.417225", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 812, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 47.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84829, "user_id": 6425, "topic_id": 14493, "post_number": 11, "raw": "I have found several contacts in their database, like agricultural consulting or food production firms and sent the invites.

Instead, you look through the list of offers (search function, filters, categories help you). And for every offer, you decide if you'd like to order it for its price tag, taking into account (as you said) space, time / urgency, contingency and identity. For every item you want to get you are supposed to create an \"order group\" in Economy App and put all your mutually alternative orders in there. Once the algorithm gets one of these alternative orders executed for you, it automatically deactivates the others. (This mechanism is to ensure the barter algorithm has enough flexibility to make deals.)\n\nNow, about the price adaptation mechanism: This will in the first version be informal, like on eBay. Which means, if sellers realize that they do not get a reasonable amount of orders for their product, they might consider lowering the price to increase demand. This of course missed capturing the \"conditional expression of interest\" from those who just did not order because the price was too high, while everything else was acceptable. So to improve on this, there will later be a \"bid price\" mechanism: An order automatically becomes active once the seller lowers the price below a threshold that a buyer entered as a bid.

A reframing of livelihood generation from a lonely, competitive activity, to one that is collaborative, sustainable and accessible to all.

Since we are now losing faith in this model, we should ask these peripheral regions to experiment different economic systems.\n\n### In the case of Messina, this seems to have come about by pioneering an approach resting on four elements:\n\n* relational goods (encoding human relationship in physical goods. Example: the local brewery had been bought up by Heineken, who proceeded to delocalize production. The Messina crowd allied with laid off brewery workers to start a new brewery. The beer made there encodes human values of dignity, local regeneration and hope).\n* stocks over flows (social economy tends to be undercapitalized, because its protagonists focus on getting funding for short-term projects. The community foundation funds no projects, only permanent initiatives)\n* systems over networks (the difference is this: the components of a system are happy to reassess their strategy depending on that of the others, moving in a more coordinated way)\n* Dyson's sphere model ( the Dyson sphere is an imaginary artifact built all around a star to capture its energy. The idea is to create prosperity for every member of the system: when a client comes around wanting, say, a consultant to organize a workshop, they are immediately asked if they also need a venue, a translation service, a travel agency and so on... all parts of the system).\n\nOver the years and in part based on the culture of the founders, they were able to come up with practices that are self-evident to them, but counterintuitive to us. Another examples: they have assembled an art collection without buying any of the pieces. They acquired them all through donations or artist residencies. The collection is worth several millions now, and Guggenheim has tried to acquire it, but of course the foundation can never sell it without destroying the goodwill that made it possible to acquire it in the first place. That the collection cannot be sold does not mean it is worthless. It has value in two senses: as the embodiment of the relationship of mutual trust between the Foundation and artists, and as a collateral to roll out revenue-generating projects. The collection is valued not for its resell value, but for its potential to grow and catalyze more activities. You do not realize this value by cashing out on the asset, but by stewarding and growing it. This is a very different value theory from the one dominant in capitalism and neoclassical economics. It is an example of the kind of thinking that can emerge from mutual aid communities. This is where Edgeryders wants to be.\n\nWhile seemingly simple and fairly easy to adopt these principles in other places, is is also easy to underestimate the complexity of local differences and embeddedness, local and regional inequalities.\n\n> \"From my experience of working in the UK, not sure if the definition of wellbeing and safety is shared across different communities. For many safety and security is keeping people outside of the borders (brexit voters). There is a big risk that people are left behind in transformations, behind we are not listening to communities having strong cultural bonds. The situation is complex, there is not the same clarity for everyone.\u201c\n\n### So what does this mean for institutional actors moving forward?\n\n*\u201cI am wondering whether we could create access through the mutual support groups of sharing and caring communities? How do you expand on the Messina case? How to add on top of that transcontextual literacy in these already stand alone communities - through more flexible policy making (not waiting for the EU)? Climb the ladder bottom up and expand on it. The axes of sharing and caring communities could be the way to start. What would be the moto to use to find that intersection?\u201d*\n\nNora Bateson says that systems when they are stuck they don\u2019t get unstuck if someone says it, but only if the systems learn together. Experience of creating transcontextuality - experiences with different identities, empathy, get the glimpse of the context of others, go beyond the polarisations and the idea of the democratic process. Lack of trust in society - part of the core things not working. Automatization of who we are. The idea of subsidiarity - top down, not bottom up and it is completely missing as well the dynamic ways of doing policies. We need a dynamic way of testing and designing policies and interventions. Locally driven and context dependent. Forget about the scalability.\n\nA key aspect is that we are going to need to experiment new processes and models for working with movement building to get something to happen, and then protect its integrity for long enough that the desired results become visible. A process which embeds the means to strengthen the political/ideological movement that has supported and protected it.\n\nAn interesting example of what happens when you don\u2019t manage to do this is the Finnish Basic Income experiment. A well thought through proposal originally came from progressive activism. but was co-opted by the political platform of the liberals which then executed it badly - ignoring fundamental elements. For example that you would need to give basic income to a sample of minimum 30,000 individuals (if I recall correctly) - and that the citizens to include should be selected randomly, and not just people on social welfare etc. Both conditions were not fulfilled. Also, it ran for less than half of the time estimate for the experiment to succeed in meeting its main target: it did not bring about significant employment effects (Demos Helsinki has published the [full report here](https://www.demoshelsinki.fi/en/2020/05/08/letter-results-of-finlands-basic-income-experiment-will-help-us-build-the-post-pandemic-society)).\n\nCompare this to the history of Folkh\u00f6gskola ( Folk high schools), a nordic model for adult education and lifelong learning that has been around since 1844. The concept originally came from the Danish writer, poet, philosopher, and pastor N. F. S. Grundtvig. The folk high school movement was an act against a [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative) ideal of both education and culture. At its core was an idea was to give the peasantry and other people from the lower echelons of society a higher educational level through personal inner development. It was born out of a reaction against the Enlightenment\u2019s view of our mind as a fixed, rational machine as opposed to being embodied in the totality of our bodies and embedded in our culture. After the 1848 revolutions in Germany these ideas travelled to the Nordic countries where they were then adopted in the educational model pioneered by Grundtvig and contemporaries. Tomasz Maliszewski at the Polish Naval Academy gives a detailed account of the rich history of this institution in Sweden ([T_Maliszewski-OntheHistoryofFolkHighSchoolsinSweden.pdf|attachment](upload://jgK9bC291Ap2XAZgqSVvmXxP1k7.pdf)) .\n\n### One conclusion we draw is that we need to embed the idea of Citizen Engagement as community action on experimenting local development economic models, rather than as citizen-to-institution consultation. \n\nBecause the citizen-engagement-as-consultation mindset is not looking at the issue of power. Consulting citizens is one of those ideas that sound like a no-brainer, but it is very difficult to get the incentives aligned right for. It's like experiments: the idea of policy experiments sounds great, but try proposing in a European forum \"let\u2019s have an experiment: revoke the copyright directive for Latvia\". You won't get far, because the powerful people *already* have what they want. You can experiment only if you can override them, but if you could do that you could also attempt to establish an alternative policy anyway.  With consultation it is the same. If the results of the consultation go against what powerful stakeholders want, the temptation to tell citizens \"we have heard you, but we do not think we can go by what you recommend\" is going to be too strong.\n\nThere could be a way out from this situation: invest time in the regional level because maybe you *can* allow citizens to hold real power, or experiment, if you go to a place that \u201cdoesn't matter\u201d. At the periphery of Europe's economy, it  is easier to get away with things. And indeed, Europe is swarming with mutant local economies (like [this case](/t/13876) in Catalonia). In practice we need to find new arenas where we can broker specific deals between communities and their local institutional and political actors around getting specific things off the ground. And create conditions for them to have staying power.\n\nIn Edgeryders we are exploring how we can spark and nurture similar dynamics between regional administrations, Political activists and groups running existing initiatives that embody different economic models. We explore how can we give enablers of a transition to a thriving future access to political power so they create the change needed? Can we shift the whole political landscape through tactical interventions and ecosystem building?\n\n* How can we help swarms develop around sticky, relevant social questions - creating conversations, relationships, and ultimately projects?\n* Can we learn from startup incubation and acceleration and create a structured approach to supporting civil society groups in becoming more effective in creating political change?\n* How can a new generation of political actors integrate turn political campaigns towards community building principles - and can we open-source this?\n\n### Welcome to our next event on October 8th during the European week of Regions and Cities. *Deadline for registration is Sunday September 27th!*\n\nWe will (1) discuss the challenges of citizen engagement; (2) discuss the role of data for and about collective intelligence; (3) present some experiences; and (4) discuss a possible future where different regions might pursue different models, rather than trying to converge on a dominant one. \n\n### Registration:\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/biglietti-citizen-engagement-and-regional-policies-119735575329 \n\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n*This summary is from an event was part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016.

The ethical suffering can occur in any organization where it is required to do things that are too far from what actual work should look like in the eyes of the concerned people who are passionated about what they do.\n\nI've observed such situations in not for profit AND in for profit organizations even though the purpose and the values behind the organization were sensefull for people. It is about the meaning of the work to be done and the way it is asked.\n\nIndeed <strong>distributed decision making processes\u00a0</strong>(cf the integrative decision making process), <strong>spaces where people can share practices in order to improve them</strong> (which supposes that they have an influence on them),\u00a0<strong>the autonomy of each team and individual in his/her area of competence and responsibility</strong>\u00a0(where each person\u00a0is sometimes leader\u00a0and sometimes follower)\u00a0combined with a <strong>results-oriented work process</strong> (instead of an effort-oriented culture giving more credit on hours spent then on results) are cornerstones\u00a0to move forward in the right direction.\n\nWhat is meant by heath at work ?

This has already generated some good content; we expect students to now get in with some more interaction.

They are an important part of the project's social contract with the community, and of its <a href=\"/t/the-opencare-engagement-strategy-at-a-glance/5545\">engagement strategy</a>. A nice touch: under the unique header of \"Fellowships\" we now bring together both the about 20 smaller rewards (Deliverable D2.2, care of Edgeryders) and the about 3 bigger ones (Task 1.2, care of ScImpulse). Noemi and Erik are working on adding 2 extra Fellowships, dedicated to policy making and coordinated and funded by HSS.</li>\n\n<li>The CountOnMe mailing list has started to go out to the people subscribed. We will need to wait maybe a week to evaluate the first results.</li>\n\n<li>All this resulted in an increase of traffic and content creation on the Edgeryders website, most of it around Op3ncare.

Though I will bring a prototype to Matera, the students could work at creating another one because it could validate the fact that it is reproductible. It is not that easy but the goal to achieve is well known and if you're good at DIY it should be feasible.</li>\n\n<li>The software part : software and various boards that move the structure. It's the central part and I've been working on it for a long time. So I think it won't be productive to let them work on this.</li>\n\n<li>Positionning system : components that will tell the system how the structure is oriented (horizontally and vertically).

Currently I have to carve out time from other things to get it done and rarely is it a priority (although perhaps it should be), if we could incentivise this and compensate the work for someone it would be good.\u00a0\n\nAnother element which I'd like to make a seperate post on soon (in order to gather ideas), is unMonastery standard practices and projects. I think there are a number of low cost but effective things unMonasteries should always do. Such as open street mapping an area\u00a0and setting weekly OSM challeges for the unMonasterians, another could be trouble shooting workshops hosted every week for local projects. I believe there should be staples, that the unMonastery can say it will always\u00a0deliver but don't demand high operational cost/energy but make the overall project more desirable and legible to host cities/towns - with all the individuals projects\u00a0coming on top to meet specific location based needs.\u00a0So considering budgets for such tasks/equipment could be a good idea.\n\nOne comment to make about the above budget from the experience I'm currently having - we gave people the option to apply for between 1-4 months, meaning that we ended up with more than 10 individual travel costs to pay, since some people will be only one month.

Thanks for sharing the relevant links about your community.\u00a0\n\nWhat you @Alberto are touching upon here is the educational element. Not even so much the question of the adoption of technology but the question of with what mindsets do people approach the technology and how they interact with it. You spoke about it very eloquently!\u00a0\n\nI am also aware of the pitfalls of what E. Morozov has called 'solutionism'. Namely, that technology and smart widgets are not going to solve anything by themselves and that there are lots of false hopes that with 'this technology or tool things are going to get better'. No, the technology on its own is not going to change anything. We need a cultural and social change and for that we need a community, which embodies the values of change and becomes the ambassadors of change and new values. So, yes we need people - individuals, who desire to really change the things our society is concerned about.\u00a0\n\nYou guys have built a wonderful community which has a very big potential. How did you start? What was the locus that brought you together (as far as I know you gathered together around an EU project: did you get together because you were part of the same network)? There wasn't a platform to begin with, but how did your activities and interactions change (if at all), once this platform was built? Did it transform the community? These are very interesting questions to me as I am curious to learn how your platform has instigated the emergence of new projects (and as a result of new communities)?\u00a0\n\nOne of my main interests in what we're doing is understanding better the potential of what communities that organically emerge from around the world can achieve together. So in that sense, I see technology as an actually crucial aspect of bringing people together. If there wasn't your platform today, we would not have this thoughtful discussion here. This is why I think that tech is useful as a facilitator and a framework within which great things can happen. There are Facebook and Google + to connect people, however, these two platforms have developed a certain culture of communication and virtual interaction which is underpinned by triviality (Google+ less so), which is, in my opinion, encoded in the software. We want to deconstruct that by building an alternative and I believe we share that desire :)\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-28 23:28:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:26.511146", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 454, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38585, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7512, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-10-20 03:36:24.360961", "updated_at": "2017-10-20 03:36:24.360961", "deleted_at": "2017-10-20 16:51:01.483851", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38591, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7515, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-10-20 04:56:45.549995", "updated_at": "2017-10-20 04:56:45.549995", "deleted_at": "2017-10-20 16:44:19.217150", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1403, "user_id": 781, "topic_id": 1370, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\nI hypothesize that individuals and organizations may create enriched realities and reinvent themselves in today\u2019s world.\u00a0 The evolution of consciousness is the first step to achieve this important goal.\u00a0 The second step is to comprehend and utilize \u201cthe forces\u201d of the system: power, knowledge, ethics, needs, and technology to create a new reality.\u00a0 I also propose a methodology to measure, through the analysis of specific situations, how a new reality may transcend new levels of complexity.

That was what the 2013 workshops were for. When we listened, people came up with the challenges reviled in the Book of Mistakes. What gives?\n\nSocial scientists know not to trust survey data (ask people questions and record their answer). Humans suffer from well-documented psychological biases that make them state falsehoods, often in perfectly good faith. So, the only way forward we have found is to ask, listen, reply back, etcetera, and engage in an open conversation that will lead somewhere. The distinction between speaking and listening seems to me not to hold much more water than the one between unMonasterians and Edgeryders.\n\nMarc is the perfect example. He gets to Matera to build a solar tracker. The solar tracker is a specific thing, and local people engage better with it than they would with some generic concept (like \"open hardware\" or \"social innovation\"). So, Mim\u00ec asks him \"Hey, since that thingy you have there can move the solar panel maybe it can also power a monitoring system for my hydroponic garden. Can it?\" And sure enough, then the monitoring system is built. Later still, Francesco shows up and says \"Solar? That's lame. The action is in high-altitude wind. Join me in building Kiderwind!\" Meanwhile, Piersoft shows up at the unMonastery to do the first Coderdojo prototype, and ends up with Marc deeply involved in Coderdojo Matera. There is listening in this story, but there is also speaking. The solar tracker is concrete enough \u2013 and fascinating \u00a0enough \u2013 to function as a conversation opener on renewable energies (Kiderwind), open data and sustainability (open energy monitor), open hardware (hydroponic garden monitor) and digital literacy (CoderDojo).\n\nIn other words, the time-honored way to engage a local community is not as an all-purpose troubleshooter (brings out psychological biases as you ask people \"what do you need?\"), but as just another person, with her own set of skills, obsessions and weaknesses. The engine for making progress is not that the newcomer is \"better\" than the local: it is the diversity between the two. In this process some unMonasterians got further than others (and that is human too), but everyone can claim at least some credit for the good things that happened.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-10 13:47:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:18.989227", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 392, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24287], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85842, "user_id": 6844, "topic_id": 14326, "post_number": 64, "raw": "Dear @noemi, nice to meet you, too.

First of all welcome on the Edgeryders platform and thank you for taking the time to think about this and share your ideas. It's always good to have new people look into the unMonastery and nourish our online discussions.\u00a0\n\nI like your post too, especially because the tension between local problems and global solutions comes out quite well. Since we're at it, and you're taking a course on Service Design, I would be very curious to have your take on the following point: imagine you're in the South of Italy, in a small city of about 60.000 inhabitants, which faces serious youth unemployment issues as well as school drop out and emigration (both for study and for work reasons). Then suddenly, here come these guys from abroad which talk with weird terms and say that people can work for free to solve issues which people don't even consider crucial (property, connectivity, ecc.).\n\nWhat can Radical Innovation mean to them? How can the unMonastery be pitched to local community in order to transfer the services it is able to offer (for example, a place for learning things in another way for drop out kids). Do you think we should have two levels of communication, say one for the locals and one for the rest - playing for example on dialectal expressions and local, recognizable heroes who tell the project?\u00a0\n\nI am also very curious to know in what way we could tie this to Expo2015: you guys seem to be \"closer\" to the Expo than us, so I would love to have your take on what Alberto asked you.\u00a0\n\nLast question: is there anything you might want to add or do in this process?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-22 04:29:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.187228", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 303, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10487, "user_id": 129, "topic_id": 2363, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>tech supporting social innovation towards digital green&amp;fair</b>\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Some ambitious objectives or aims that I want to see realised are\u00a0\n\n\u2022technology supporting social innovation towards \u2022digital green, \u2022digital fair\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Somethings that could contribute towards them happening are\u00a0\n\n\u2022project development e.g. one into the direction mentioned above and one in collaboration with public sector, acknowledging and supporting them as important driver of public/open innovation towards sustainable development\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0I would know we had succeeded through\u00a0\n\n\u2022a pilot project that builds a precedence case for multiplication by attraction\u00a0\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Something we would need to build/ make happen in order to get closer to the goal is\u00a0\n\n\u2022do it: develop project, find partners, write application\n\n5 a.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0What would you need to figure out to be able to do so?\u00a0\n\n\u2022have to go through Horizion Material, will try to find out about framework (min. organizations needed, min. amount of funding etc., contact person \u2026)\u00a0\n\n5 b.What questions need to be answered (that could need research attention directed to)?

Have a look.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe field-process-model is a theoretical framework the Institute for Participatory Design developed to understand generative design processes as dynamic interactions of forces in a field. The development of this model became necessary after we encountered numerous theoretical and practical problems with the application of our former, more systemic oriented, understanding of pattern languages and design processes. The field-process-model explores the idea that a field with its forces (as used in numerous pattern languages) is the spatial description of a process, which in turn is the temporal description of a dynamic field. The model gives us a good understanding of how generativity and emergence unfold and how we as designers can foster these qualities in our design processes. Beneath the question of the emergence of new (design) ideas, the model also helps to investigate qualities such as immergence, crisis or bifurcation and of cultivation for generative processes. With the framework the field-process-model describes, we can develop applicable tools and strategies for actual design. The goal is to design in open and flexible processes that are alive and create results that are alive.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.partizipativ-gestalten.de/2011/11/the-field-process-model/\">http://blog.partizipativ-gestalten.de/2011/11/the-field-process-model/</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-28 09:12:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:17.109066", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 242, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 15.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19077, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1245, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>... but we are on our guard! :-)</b>\n\nMy pleasure, T.\n\nOf course you can use this material. Everything here is licensed under creative commons-by (you can do anything as long as you quote the source), and I am only glad to be of service. But I can do you a better deal: I volunteer to help in getting the conversation going. I think I can get others to do so, starting from the radical fringe of the Edgeryders team.\n\nHere's my proposal. In January (on the 9th, to be precise), Edgeryders will launch a new campaign about democratic participation, probably called \"we, the people\". We will try to map out what young people are doing to reinvent democracy. This includes the opengov/opendata movement, that a few people have already touched upon in Edgeryders; stuff like participatory budgeting; but also more radical endeavors like the Chokepoint project and, in general, Internet activism. And, of course, the occupy/indignados \"real-life\" participation.\n\nThe conversation we had on this mission could be the basis for an Edgeryders mission on systemic change through political participation. We could write the mission brief together, asking the community the hard questions; get the conversation started, and push it out through social media. You could reach out to people you respect, within and without the movement. With a little luck we could have a moment of truth, in which you guys see yourselves through the eyes of people like me, who are really really sympathetic but need a few kinks ironed out before we can join forces.\n\nWhat do you say?\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-12 10:27:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.394068", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 277, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9142], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31674, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 2156, "post_number": 29, "raw": "<b>DONE!</b>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e0de0e165263880edf3f9b44b3d8a792209bcfc9.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"260\"><br>\n\nChe Fare Application sent 1 day and 9 hours before deadline :-)\n\nThank you [Alberto] [pacheca] <font color=\"#000000\" size=\"2\"><span>and all the others who made this possible: fruit of a collective effort, we now have the unMonastery also in Italian. 2 weeks of work were worth the shot!

We welcome @SZdenek to the team, who came with many generative questions that spurred some great conversation. \n\nPresent: @Jan @Richard @Jirka_Kocian @supernova   -- please feel free to add anything I've missed! \n\nTake-homes from the call:\n\n1) Define all codes, no matter how obvious they seem, so we can be sure that we are using the same words in the same way. \n2) Break up longer/highly specific compound codes into 2 different ones, as long as each individual code carries semantic meaning and isn't too vague. \n\nWe decided that assigning codes in two different languages to the same block of text (native language and English translation) instead of doing the slash system is very preferable, so that co-occurrences in English and English translations across the languages can display (and so we don't just have isolated islands of languages). This will optimally be supported by a front-end function that can assign both to the same text at the same time. Ideally, when typing in codes in English, the box will display code suggestions from across the POPREBEL projects (so, by any other POPREBEL ethnographer, instead of only individual's code or previous system where all codes from all projects were suggested). Depending on how the dual-code function works, suggestions in the native language should ideally include all codes that have been assigned in the project in that language. @matthias\n\nThere are 2 major things to focus on when coding using English translations/English:\n\n1) Read others' codebooks and make note of when they are using a different code in the same way as one of yours -- then make a note suggesting that we merge the codes.\n2) Read others' codebooks and make a note of when they are using the same code in a different way -- make a note that we should fork the codes. \n\n\nWe had a long discussion about hierarchies. Conclusions: \n\n1. Make sure that all codes carry meaning on their own and do not rely on a hierarchical representation (e.g. the presence of the parent code) to carry meaning. Both parent and child codes should carry clear semantic meaning on their own.\n2. Use hierarchies to organise codes in the codebook. Don't worry about inputting them into the backend right away, but continue to use them to structure and make the codebook clear. Feel free to use a separate tab in the codebook to make note of hierarchies. \n\n\n@matthias, we are wondering if it is possible to export the hierarchies (list of parent and child codes) into excel or CSV format (I think @Jirka_Kocian may have more to add here).  \n\nSuggestion for next call: Thursday April 30, 3pm Brussels time.

I had first envisioned that ER would be doing mostly online community & facilitation, and RG the offline wet lab work.\n\nBut now thinking about it, it makes more sense to divide the work differently: ER taking the lead on community infrastructure (offline & online) and RG taking the lead on scientific knowledge and infrastructure (offline & online). Of course there will be overlap. This way it's more mixing of expertise and especially dividing the problem into more manageable subparts for our approach. There's no constant \"handing off\" of certain activities or people from the online to the offline.\n\nAlso, I'm thinking that by defining an \"online\" part and an \"offline\" part, the offline/online interface becomes kind of self-fulfilling, no? But if you have a community part that flows from offline to online, tackled by the same team, the transition could go more smoothly.\n\nAlso from experience it's sometimes surprising what has the biggest impact. Coming back to the discussion in this thread: constantly stewarding information is quite fundamental, both offline and online. We have now 8 design students running around in our lab working on 2 questions:\n\"How do we reduce the amount of knowledge lost in the community eg. from people not documenting what they do\"\n\"How do we increase the amount of knowledge that newcomers have access to, eg. by making it apparent what they can do in the lab when they walk in?\"\nThat would be way more effective if done by one team over both the offline and online.\n\nSo my hunch is that \"community\" and \"wet lab work\" done by different partners will integrate with each other more easily than \"offline\" with \"online\". Maybe that's how you already thought it up, so in that case I got it just now ;-)", "created_at": "2018-03-15 09:07:10.374597", "updated_at": "2018-03-15 09:07:10.374597", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 318, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 73.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [42822], "is_liked_by": [3704, 3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38610, "user_id": 3818, "topic_id": 6739, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Yes @nadia & @aquamammal\n\ncouldn't make it yesterday, really want to hear a little about it. \n\ngot a recorder (thanks to laurel), I'm in the main hall all day..\n\nS.", "created_at": "2017-10-20 08:09:11.966495", "updated_at": "2017-10-20 08:09:11.966495", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [38578], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82055, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14245, "post_number": 13, "raw": "**Your name** <br /> maria <br /><br /> **Your email** <br /> ;sdf;o <br /><br /> **Your motivation or background** <br /> testesttest   xxxx <br /><br /> **Which of those categories would best fit you in context with this event?** <br /> media <br /><br /> **undefined** <br /> true <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-08-19 10:24:38.503332", "updated_at": "2020-08-19 10:24:38.503332", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 44, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34231, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4760, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hi Driss,\n\ncurious as to how this initiative is going?

Vi\u0161e od deceniju i po \u017eivim u Beogradu, glavnom gradu Republike Srbije. Novinar sam, radio sam kao reporter, voditelj i urednik na televizijama B92 i Studio B.

Jer blagostanje mo\u017ee imati spiritualnu ili \u010dak religijsku konotaciju i ima rajski prizvuk kona\u010dnosti. Dakle kada bih promi\u0161ljao \u0161ta je za mene welbeing, radije bih govorio o dobrobiti. To implicira segmentiranost i stalno ulaganje, jer dobrobit mo\u017ee do\u0107i sa raznih strana, iz vi\u0161e oblasti i kada bismo stalno radili za sopstvenu i dobrobit dru\u0161tva u kojem \u017eivimo, mo\u017eda bismo jednog dana i to blagostanje dostigli. No ipak, na\u0161e dru\u0161tvo sada je daleko od dobrobiti u svim oblastima. Toliko, da nam blagostanje zaista deluje kao stvar koju mi ateisti do\u010dekati ne\u0107emo, a vernike mo\u017eda sa\u010deka u zagrobnom \u017eivotu. Zato bih da ovde vi\u0161e govorimo o prakti\u010dnim stvarima, o tome da li na\u0161a dru\u0161tva danas rade za sopstvenu dobrobit, da li to rade na\u0161e dr\u017eave i politi\u010dari. Najradije bih da govorimo o tome kako dru\u0161tvo i dr\u017eava brinu o zdravlju i socijalnoj za\u0161titi svojih gra\u0111anki i gra\u0111ana.\nNa po\u010detku sam pomenuo da su i republika i federacija u kojoj sam ro\u0111en u svom nazivu sadr\u017eale re\u010d \u201esocijalisti\u010dka\u201c. Bio je to poseban, jugoslovenski socijalizam. Nesavr\u0161en kao i svako dr\u017eavno ure\u0111enje, ali mnogi na to vreme i danas gledaju kao na doba socijalizma sa ljudskim likom. Jer svi gra\u0111ani te zemlje imali su pravo na besplatno \u0161kolovanje, besplatnu zdravstvenu za\u0161titu, a svakovrsna socijalna za\u0161tita bila je stvar koja se podrazumevala. Ne, naravno da nije sve bilo savr\u0161eno. Uprkos op\u0161te-jugoslovenskoj potrebi da u svemu \u0161to je stvoreno imamo prefiks \u201enaj\u201c taj sistem imao je mnogo mana. A opet, vi\u0161e smo verovali u sebe. Ve\u0107ina Jugoslovenki i Jugoslovena tako je mislila da su njihovi piloti najbolji, da su lekari najstru\u010dniji, da je bar ne\u0161to oko njih najve\u0107e, najbolje ili najlep\u0161e, makar u Evropi, ako ne i u svetu. Dok se u to verovalo, populizma nije bilo. Politi\u010dari sve do kraja osamdesetih nisu govorili samo ono \u0161to su ljudi \u017eeleli da \u010duju. Tako se Tito ve\u0107 \u0161ezdesetih o\u0161tro verbalno obra\u010dunava sa nacionalistima i populistima, sedamdesetih se dr\u017eava o\u0161tro borila protiv bu\u0111enja prousta\u0161kih i pro\u010detni\u010dkih pokreta, a osamdesetih je jugoslovenska \u201e\u010deli\u010dna lejdi\u201c Milka Planinc zavodila stroge mere \u0161tednje koje joj svakako nisu mogle podi\u0107i popularnost. Ali popularnosti i populizam nisu ni bili tako va\u017eni gra\u0111anima koji su \u010dak i kada nije bilo benzina ili kafe, bar uvek mogli da ra\u010dunaju na besplatnu i pristojnu zdravstvenu i socijalnu za\u0161titu.\nOnda su do\u0161le devedesete, raspad zemlje i rat, pa ti isti gra\u0111ani vi\u0161e nisu imali ni kafe, ni benzina, ali ni bilo kakvu vrstu sigurnosti. Zdravstveni sistem i sistem socijalne za\u0161tite uru\u0161eni su nebrigom, populisti\u010dkim pristupom, nedostatkom novca i korupcijom. Ono o \u010demu bih voleo da ovde zajedno promi\u0161ljamo je \u2013 \u0161ta sada?\n\u0160ta sada kada se u Srbiji spektakularno otvaraju velelepni, novi i moderni klini\u010dki centri, dok u domovima zdravlja i ambulantama vi\u0161e nema lekara koji bi pacijente uputili u te klini\u010dke centre? \u0160ta sada kada lekari i medicinske sestre odlaze u zemlje Evropske unije, dok im se u Srbiji obe\u0107avavaju ve\u0107e plate i bolji \u017eivotni standard za dve, najvi\u0161e tri godine? \u0160ta sada kada oni koji imaju, pla\u0107aju na hiljade evra, na crno i bez ra\u010duna, da se njihovi najmiliji le\u010de ili da umru dostojanstveno u privatnim klinikama, dok oni koji te hiljade nemaju, bespomo\u0107no gledaju kako im bliski ljudi odlaze? \u0160ta sada kada jedan mali sloj dru\u0161tva svojim bakama i dekama mirnu starost pru\u017ea u preskupim stara\u010dkim domovima, dok mnogi penzioneri umiru u uslovima nedostojnim, a nakon svega \u0161to su uradili za ovo dru\u0161tvo? \u0160ta sada? \nUpoznao sam nedavmo u  Novom Pazaru gospo\u0111u koja ima oko sedamdeset godina.

Nema za dom. Nema za lekove, nema za hranu, nema nikoga da je pomogne. Nema ni socijalnu pomo\u0107, jer ima penziju, nema politi\u010dare koji bi se sa njom slikali, jer ta slika nije lepa.

Given that about 100 million people worldwide make their living from coffee farming right now, quite some impact is possible.\n\nWe're not trying it all at once though. Right now @anu and I have worked on a few parts of the puzzle (and we're inviting everyone interested to join or start work on a new part):\n\n* open source [optical coffee sorter](/t/id/7122), a project for our team in OpenVillage Academy\n* an open source coffee production manual, [started here](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Coffee_Farming), with 40 pages of more content I have written locally that has to be integrated; esp. covers DIY coffee import / export\n* beginning of an [open source coffee roaster](/t/id/7677), but not all at once; we'll start from a simple commercial model to which we add open source electronic control, and later move to a complete open hardware product\n\nSometimes I still wonder how I got involved with coffee :smile: But then again, it still seems a low hanging fruit to improve livelihoods of small-scale farmers in Nepal, as they have the perfect conditions to grow a high-value crop. So why not combine it as the business model of an OpenVillage House. I hope to visit Nepal again in fall this year and help Anu get OpenVillage House Hetauda going.

I'm 24 and I have never participated in an organized or spontaneous movement. I'm not against them, nor am I particularly reluctant.. also never had an opportunity to engage in a cause that I deem relevant for myself.\n\nSo I ask you: to what extent do you stand up there for a personal reason and to what extent are you there out of solidarity, civicness, the idea of fighting for a better world?

Different from other barter platforms, trades are made fully automatically (based on values entered in currency values, but that's just to measure them, nothing is paid in money). Also different from other platforms is that this one is more flexible than giving one thing and getting one: it can happen that you get <em>m</em> things for <em>n</em> things you give, if only the values on each side match.\n\nWe're in early testing right now, so things are often broken and change here and there. Also it's not yet beautiful there. Will be better in a bit. But if you are tolerant with alpha software, welcome to register and have a look: <a href=\"http://www.makerfox.com/\">makerfox.com</a>. In principle you can enter offers etc. and barter exchanges are found and executed when possible, but this needs more users still. Since this is testing phase, your opinion about the concepts / understandability would be the best contribution.

Joined by most of the \"core\" Sidi Kaouki housemates: @hadeerghareeb, @mmajdeb, @sofien-dahem, @hazem and me.\n\nThese are my notes. Feel free to add missing pieces, your points or corrections in the comments. If you could not make it to the call, you are very welcome to add your points and feebacks below \u2013 esp. @islem and @m_tantawy who wanted to join the call but couldn't make it \u2026 we were of course really missing you! :)\n\n\n#### What is your general feedback on the OpenVillage House prototype in Sidi Kaouki? If you imagine your ideal OpenVillage House, how would it be?\n\n**Hadeer:** I loved the experience in general and the concept behind it. When imagining the ideal version: we should be involved in everything regarding the house, including producing our own food and house repairs and \"big\" maintenance. Also it would be better if we have a motive to work for food etc. \u2026 while in Kaouki, we had everything (food, Internet, bed) even when not working anything. \n\n  &nbsp; In Kaouki, we were only \"almost\" doing the thing we wanted: living together, coworking, producing our own stuff. But not quite!\n\n**Mohamed:** _(translated from Arabic by Hadeer)_ When I came to Sidi Kaouki, I was so excited, expecting we will have a lot of work to do and we will learn and add to the experience. But when I reached the house I didn't find things organized each worked alone. I was working day with matt then stop for 2 days, even the team not well connected. We worked theoretically more than practically. And I got a job offer so I changed the flight time. I loved the house and everybody but maybe i was over excited. It was a good experience I learned a lot from and will not forget. Hopefully if there is another time, we will be learned from this one.\n\n**Sofien:** I liked the last days when I had the feedback and help with my project. I was open to fuse my project with OpenVillage, making it more entrepreneurial. I liked having different people with different backgrounds and ideas around. For example, me as an industrial designer helping Matthias with the coffee sorter. I would have liked if we had worked more on that part. That was probably the idea, but it lacked an \"organizational push\", so the majority of the project work did not make much progress or get done. \n\n  &nbsp; So for the next time, we should specify from the beginning what is supposed to happen and what should be delivered. This would bring motivation (connecting to what Hadeer said about the motivational aspect).\n\n\n#### Would it be a better experience for you if you start a collaboration online and then proceed in a space? Or if you join an existing project with long-term members in a space, and stay for a short while? Also, would you see yourself as a short / medium term member or long term member?\n\n**Sofien:** That will depend on the project and who is involved. For me, as an industrial designer, yes I could work in both situations. It would be more efficient if I would join a long-term team for a time (if it's an industrial design project), as there have to be some people who dive into the topic for a longer time. For digital design / graphics design, it's different. And: I'm totally up for a long-term commune work/life integration lifestyle. That's very related to the idea of my project involving immersion in local handicrafts. I am comfortable in these communal situations. If well-managed, it really boosts my work efficiency.\n\n**Hadeer:** For me it would be better if the brainstorming phase and \"getting to know\" phases would start online. Because we consumed a lot of time for that in Sidi Kaouki, so we could get that done before. Also, in the House practical work (\"work with results\") was missing. So we'd better add that. Including physical work. \n\n  &nbsp; Regarding the duration of physical co-working / co-living, it depends on what the project is about. If it's making progress, it would be ok to be long term. If it's monotonous, it would be probably boring. I am up for a long-term member but only if the activities keep me interested. Once I explored the House, I needed to find other stuff to epxlore in the area (Aziz etc.) to keep me motivated and interested.\n\n\n#### What would be a suitable vision / mission that could keep a communal project together?\n\n**Hadeer:** Friends from university keep connected until the graduate. Because they see a benefit in belonging to the group, but only until then. Benefits can be protection, help in achieving ones dreams etc.. So that should be similar in a communal living situation. \n\n  &nbsp; The thing to avoid is \"monotonous living\", when the day is governed only by routine. So the theme should be \"mutual benefit\", \"everyone feeling that they benefit in some way\", \"regular changes\".\n\n**Sofien:** Local business creation is a good theme. But it would be better to scan the place and community before the communal living project starts, so that we could from the start collaborate with local youth. Collaborations with the young local people could be anything from founding small workshops to big projects. It would be also about making them see what their environment has in unexplored potential. That should be beneficial to the people in the region, and would also be sustainable because it invests in building entrepreneurs (mindset) and businesses. Also these businesses could then form a network that provide business opportunities for each other. Would also create a bigger community for Edgeryders and the world (thinking big!). This idea is inspired by the unexpected experience with Habiba and helping her found a small business. There will be many more people like her who have the guts but not the means or skills to become entrepreneurs who can fend for themselves and their families.\n\n**Hazem:** A friend is interested in the process with the guesthouse, as a business concept. Because it could be replicated on a larger scale, as a profitable project.", "created_at": "2018-06-22 00:39:19.717040", "updated_at": "2018-06-22 00:40:47.877969", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1066, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 263.2, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3782, 3791, 4275, 4265, 3, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83544, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14200, "post_number": 6, "raw": "would be great if you could connect us :).", "created_at": "2020-09-22 14:36:49.528884", "updated_at": "2020-09-22 14:36:49.528884", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [83542], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45817, "user_id": 4557, "topic_id": 8585, "post_number": 10, "raw": "@anique.yael I am finally online ;) Long overdue ha!", "created_at": "2018-06-22 02:14:22.627933", "updated_at": "2018-06-22 02:14:22.627933", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 107.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25679, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4829, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>Done this</b>\n\nTo a very first approximation:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://unreasonableinstitute.org/profile/ngaines/\">Nancy Gaines</a>\u00a0(Denver) \u2013 Ex- high-profile management consultant, now \"following her passion of serving others\".</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://unreasonableinstitute.org/profile/rcarlson/\">Rick Carlson</a>\u00a0(Aspen) \u2013 Experience in sales (but tech sales)</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://unreasonableinstitute.org/profile/fbevins/\">Frankki Bevins</a>\u00a0(Denver) \u2013 McKinsey....</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://unreasonableinstitute.org/profile/jcalderon/\">Jorge Calderon</a>\u00a0(San Francisco) \u2013 Also a consultant. \"Jorge\u2019s practice helps capital sources and operating companies transform intentional social purpose into economic and positive impact value.\"</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://unreasonableinstitute.org/profile/kgibbs/\">Karen Gibbs</a>\u00a0(Boulder) \u2013 Consultant, but focusing on small artisan businesses.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nEveryone is in Colorado except for Calderon.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-13 18:01:08", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:50.036248", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 142, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25336], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25256, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4260, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>No</b>\n\nWhat I am, is being empathetic towards what Ben admitted is his perception and others' (but not all) and I take his points at face value, so I make a decision to engage, even it it feels unconfortable.\u00a0\n\nWhat I am not, is someone who would talk about what they imply is everyone in the community, the community as an immovable entity, or even worse, position myself above all with my views of what \"it\" should become.

Anyone else can sign up to other things, drive their conversations and projects etc. It would be great if other ER organisations would pop up, and you now are involved in one, while building on everything that the people and content here has to offer or offered, which is the exact purpose because we all stand to benefit. What we have is a common space and shared networks that we can each use generatively (my own work and ER LbG's lies bare naked for anyone to build on and I'm not concerned that it will get stolen because of so much openness and a compulsive working out loud culture:)).

Stephanie Maher lebt seit 1996 in Deutschland und erz\u00e4hlt in diesem Interview Sylvie wie sie mit der aktuellen Situation umgeht und was ihr durch den Kopf geht:\n\n### Ponderosa Stolzenhagen\n\n**Sylvie:** *Hi Stephanie, kannst Du kurz erz\u00e4hlen wer ihr seid uns was ihr macht?*\n\n**Stephanie:** Ponderosa ist ein Kunstzentrum, eine Community und ein Ort zum Versammeln und Austauschen. Wir befindet uns im Dorf Stolzenhagen, 1200 Einwohnern und etwa eine Zugstunde von Berlin entfernt, nahe der deutsch-polnischen Grenze.\n\nUnser Team von K\u00fcnstlern arbeitet daran, die Kluft zwischen Jung und Alt und die Grenzen zwischen Menschen und Nationen zu \u00fcberbr\u00fccken - sei es in den umliegenden D\u00f6rfern Brandenburgs, zwischen Polen und Deutschland oder in der internationalen Gemeinschaft. Dabei steht im Vordergrund, einen Ort zu schaffen, der au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlich und einladend ist, w\u00e4hrend gleichzeitig der gegenseitige Erfahrungsaustausch und gemeinsames Wachstum gef\u00f6rdert werden sollen.\n\n\n**Sylvie:** *Wie kam es dazu, dass du hier eine Community gestartet hast?*\n\n**Stephanie:** Eine lange Zeit \u00fcber hatte ich diese starke Identit\u00e4t als T\u00e4nzerin, was so ziemlich meine Karriere war, in die ich all meine Konzentration und Disziplin investiert habe, seit ich in meinen 20ern war. Auch, dass ich mich in den Bereich des kollektiven Organisierens begeben habe, auch als Gr\u00fcndungsmitglied vieler Projekte, ob es nun um einen Kindergarten ging oder darum, diesen Ort hier zu finden.\n\nMerkw\u00fcrdigerweise dachte ich immer, ich w\u00fcrde als arme K\u00fcnstlerin enden, was auch einen gro\u00dfen Teil meiner Identit\u00e4t gepr\u00e4gt hat. So war mein Motto: \"Nimm es selbst in die Hand und mach was draus.\" Warte nicht darauf, dass irgendeine Institution Studios bereitstellen, die am Ende eher heruntergekommen sind, h\u00e4sslich, und auch nicht gen\u00fcgend Finanzierung haben. \n\n### Die aktuelle Situation und ihre Auswirkungen\n\n**Sylvie:** *Wie geht es euch denn gerade, mit allen Herausforderungen vor denen wir hier stehen?*\n\n**Stephanie:** Covid war nat\u00fcrlich eine gro\u00dfe Frage f\u00fcr mich, weil ich kaum Zeit habe, Performances und Choreographien durchzuf\u00fchren. Aber ich habe sehr viel Zeit im Studio verbracht.\n\nIm Moment versuche ich, Raum f\u00fcr andere zu schaffen und mich gleichzeitig an die Lage anzupassen, es dennoch zu erm\u00f6glichen hier G\u00e4ste zu empfangen und k\u00fcnstlerischen Austausch zu erm\u00f6glichen. Wie k\u00f6nnen wir unsere Ressourcen teilen? Wie k\u00f6nnen wir der Angst entsagen und Verantwortung \u00fcbernehmen, damit Menschen sich hier weiterhin versammeln k\u00f6nnen? Und wen lade ich dann ein? Wer eingeladen wird, ist ebenfalls eine gro\u00dfe Frage, die mich sehr besch\u00e4ftigt. Und f\u00fcr manche Menschen sind wir hier nun mal in Ost-Brandenburg, wo rechte Parteien wieder Aufschwung erleben und du niemanden allein an der Bahnstation warten lassen willst. Wie schaffen wir es also, hier einen sicheren Raum zu schaffen? Auch das ist ein gro\u00dfes Thema f\u00fcr mich.\n\n**Sylvie:** *Und glaubst du, Covid zeigt uns eigentlich nur nochmal deutlich, was sowieso schon lange passiert? Ich meine, hast du das Gef\u00fchl dass da gerade etwas zum Vorschein kommt, was sich schon lange unter der Oberfl\u00e4che befunden hat oder sagst du eher, jetzt kommt das was du schon im Gef\u00fchl hattest?*\n\n**Stephanie:** Ehrlicherweise haben wir letztes Jahr schon eine Entscheidung getroffen, die uns gut vorbereitet hat, und zwar dass wir diesen Sommer \"Air Camps\" veranstalten: Wir verkaufen keine Workshops, und wir haben kein grosses Programm. Wir wollen einfach dass Menschen kommen um sich zu entspannen, zusammen zu sein, ihren Platz zu finden, und Raum f\u00fcr andere zu halten.\n\nAls Covid dann kam, hatte ich schon die R\u00e4umlichkeiten ge\u00f6ffnet, um Menschen einzuladen und vor allem - dass sie hier nicht konsumieren, sondern mitmachen. So kamen wir auch zum Titel \"Tipping Utopia\", da wir ohnehin schon in einem \u00dcbergang waren. Ponderosa wurde zu gro\u00df und wir mussten ein kleines Gewerbe anmelden um die \u00dcbernachtungen und Verpflegung zu managen. Vorher war es viel informeller, es funktionierte wie eine Familie, wir halfen uns gegenseitig und viele Menschen kamen einfach her um zu helfen und gemeinsam haben wir diesen Ort geschaffen. Jetzt als Unternehmen muss ich wissen wann es Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck gibt, wie viele Leute kommen, da ich den Koch bezahlen muss, und der Bescheid wissen muss. Dabei will ich spontan bleiben, experimentell. Ich will Underground bleiben, nicht anderen Leuten sagen was sie zu tun haben. \n\nEs war also schon ein Kampf f\u00fcr mich. Daf\u00fcr habe ich Ja zu einigen Dingen gesagt, von denen ich wusste, dass ich es eigentlich gar nicht wollte. Manches war Gesetz, manches war der Wunsch meines Partners sich weiterzuentwickeln, und Leuten hier Arbeit zu geben. Das ist seine Vorstellung davon, zur\u00fcckzugeben: Menschen zum Herkommen zu bewegen, an diesen seltsamen Ort an der polnischen Grenze, um Kultur zu vermitteln, gerade was die aussterbende Region Ost-Deutschlands betrifft, auch Themen wie Infrastruktur. Ich wei\u00df nicht, wieviele Leute sich tats\u00e4chlich mehr Kunst und Kultur w\u00fcnschen, und vor allem den damit verbundenen internationalen Zulauf der ihr Dorf belagert. Also suchen wir den Dialog.\n\nJa, also wir waren schon auf eine Weise bereit f\u00fcr das was kam, ich meine wir haben das Unternehmen seit 2016, und mit den \"Air Camps\" wollten wir einen Ort schaffen, wo Menschen zur Ruhe kommen k\u00f6nnen. Zur Ruhe kommen ist derzeit sehr polititsch, \u201cNein\u201d zu sagen zu dieser kapitalistischen Maschinerie und entspannen. \n\n### Leben und Wirken im Kollektiv\n\n**Sylvie:** *Ihr wart also schon im Umbruch, hat die Situation auch etwas daran ver\u00e4ndert wie ihr zusammenlebt?*\n\n**Stephanie:** Ich habe auch gesagt, dass wir uns regional aufstellen werden. Ich will mich mehr auf die Umgebung vor Ort konzentrieren.\n\nLeute kommen her und denken \u201cOh mein Gott, wir sind in Utopia, so sch\u00f6n!\u201d Wir essen zusammen, wir schlafen zusammen, wir verbringen Zeit im Garten. Es ist wie Utopia.\n\nAber jeder, der wirklich Teil des Kollektivs ist und schon einmal 5 Stunden lang \u00fcber ein bestimmtes Thema diskutieren musste, wird feststellen, dass es vieler Kompromisse und Engagement bedarf, um vern\u00fcnftig zu kommunizieren und Entscheidungen zu treffen. Also dachte ich mir, wir bleiben regional und h\u00f6ren auf, all diese internationalen Leute einzuladen. Wir bleiben regional und verbinden uns hier.\n\nAls Gesellschaft befinden wir uns auf dem Weg ins Ungewisse, und komischerweise ist dies genau die Situation die ich kenne. Und was ich festgestellt habe, ich dass Menschen immer etwas brauchen, an dem sie Halt finden.\n\nAls alles zusammengebrochen ist, haben wir mitangesehen wie die ganze Wirtschaft kollabierte. Und dann war es einfach so, als ob ein Knopf gedr\u00fcckt wurde und alle gingen zur\u00fcck zur Arbeit - obwohl die Gefahr weiterhin besteht.\n\nUnd einfach nur dieses ganze System zu beobachten, wie es sich an die Normalit\u00e4t klammert, und weil die Wirtschaft \u00fcber allem thront, ging es einfach nur ums wirtschaftliche \u00dcberleben. Und ich kann wirklich nur von Gl\u00fcck sagen, dass ich \u00fcber diesen Raum zusammen mit 40 Leutem verf\u00fcge und mich niemand fragt \u201cWo ist die Miete?\u201d Ansonsten k\u00f6nnte ich nichts so umsetzen, wie ich es tue.\n\nWir haben sehr lang versucht, die reine Funktionalit\u00e4t des Gesch\u00e4ftsmodells von der Idee zu trennen, uns selbst zu versorgen und K\u00fcnstler zu empfangen, damit unser gemeinn\u00fctziges Projekt funktionieren kann. Mittlerweile machen wir alles zusammen. Und passen und st\u00e4ndig an die Gegebenheiten an.\n\n### Herausforderungen gemeinsam bew\u00e4ltigen\n\n**Sylvie:** *Frustriert sich denn etwas an der ganzen Situation? Was glaubst du, hindert dich daran, dein eigentliches Potential weiter zu entfalten?*\n\n**Stephanie:** Vielleicht ist es einfach eine kapitalistische Struktur. Es ist so allgegenw\u00e4rtig. Und ich denke, dass Deutschland wirklich gute Arbeit darin leistet, f\u00fcr mehr soziale Gleichheit und Strukturen zu sorgen und sich um die Menschen zu k\u00fcmmern. Aber gleichzeitig existiert auch dieser gro\u00dfe internationale Markt, der die komplette Stadt aufkauft und junge Startups, die unendlich viel Geld machen. Und dann ist nach einem Jahr alles gelaufen und es wird in den M\u00fcll geworfen und verlassen. Das ist mehr als destruktiv.\n\nDas macht es auch schwer herauszufinden, wo die ganzen Mittel eigentlich hingehen und wie sie verteilt werden sollten. Es ist von Person zu Person verschieden und h\u00e4ngt oft von Privilegien ab. Wenn man beispielsweise in einer eher schlechten Nachbarschaft aufw\u00e4chst, f\u00fchlt man sich oft gar nicht, als verdiene man es, etwas zu erreichen.\n\nDiese Anh\u00e4ufung von Reichtum, die Reichen werden reicher und all diese Entwicklungen, dass diese \u00f6stlichen D\u00f6rfer sich weiter entwickeln sollten. Ich kenne einige Leute vom Dorf, die hergekommen sind und froh sind, hier zu sein. Es f\u00fchlt sich an, wie eine andere Zeit und es ist ruhig und man kann nachts die Sterne sehen. Und nat\u00fcrlich macht es sich auch seit der Covid-Krise bemerkbar, dass die Berliner eher raus wollen um die Gro\u00dfstadt hinter sich zu lassen oder auch \u00e4ltere Mitmenschen in ihren 80ern, die unter unbezahlbaren Mieten leiden und sich noch einmal umorientieren.\n\nDieser ganze Ort wurde auch durch andere Menschen inspiririert und ins Leben gerufen. Es geht nicht nur um mich, das alles kann nur exisitieren, weil all diese Menschen daran mitgewirkt haben. Wir haben B\u00e4ume gepflanzt, M\u00fcll eingesammelt und versucht, uns den freundlich gesinnten Einheimischen anzun\u00e4hern. Wir leben nicht alleine und die Menschen hier haben unglaubliche Arbeit vollbracht.\n\nVieles unserer Philosophie baut auf meinen Erfahrungen mit Improvisation auf - vor allem mit diesem Gef\u00fchl der Unsicherheit umzugehen. Wie viel Kontrolle kann ich wirklich aufgeben, bevor die Zweifel einsetzen: Kann ich diesen Leuten wirklich vertrauen? Machen sie nicht alles kaputt? Wer zahlt daf\u00fcr wenn etwas schiefgeht. Zu lernen damit umzugehen, ist ein langer Prozess aber es zahlt sich aus - ich sehe dies nicht nur daran dass wir einen Ort wie Ponderosa aufbauen konnten, aber auch wie viele Menschen hier Platz zum Experimentieren gefunden haben, f\u00fcr den oft im hektischen Alltagsleben vor Covid selten wirklich Zeit war, und daraus wunderbare Kreationen entstanden.\n\n**Sylvie:** *Stephanie, vielen Dank f\u00fcr Deine Zeit.*", "created_at": "2020-10-29 10:31:59.354527", "updated_at": "2020-10-29 10:46:39.983581", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1608, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 11.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79755, "user_id": 6484, "topic_id": 13988, "post_number": 27, "raw": "Hi! @amelia \nYesterday Jan and I had a meeting and we came up with a few questions.\n\n1. Say, we have a code stigmatisation, an example of which may be labelling, and we encounter a text where a set of labels is listed. So a person mentions that people call her a feminazi, a dike, etc. Is it ok to code every label? I know we should rather avoid coding word-for-word, but some of them, like Polish \"pisior\" (a Law and Justice hardcore supportrer) wil keep popping up and we think are worth coding.\n\n2. Jan came up with the idea to introduce the code constructing_common_identity with children such as: nation, religious community, Europeans, etc. I have already noticed the issues of common identity being raised here and there, people speaking of the need for finding, (re) building it, complaining of it being dismantled, so I think it might be worthwhile to have it.\n\n3. Matters related to inclusion/exclusion dychotomy seem to play a central role in our investigations. Have you guys come across any mentions of these two? How do you code them?\n\n4. We have a story about living libraries, and we'd like to code them under countering_exclusion -> learning/teaching pluralism -> living libraries. Does that sound ok?\n\n5. Jan and I think that having two codes positive_sentiment and negative_sentiment to code for positive feelings/attitude and negative feelings/attitude towards something respectively might be of use. Do you code for emotions? Does it make sense at all to put these into backend (I have my doubts since their proliferation may distort the SSNA graphical output, yet they seem to be ethnographically valuable). Please advise.\n\n6. Polishness is described using various labels (provincial, religious, tolerant, etc.). How can we code a phenomenon that is being defined by means of listing its characteristics. \n\n7. One last thing. When I put my codes in the backend they sometimes merge automatically with already pre-existing codes by other annotators, sometimes they don't (for example my homophobia, or country_comparison are now under Amelia's, while my code church stays separate). It's not a problem now, but may somehow make adding tranlsations more difficult. Will see. Just saying :slight_smile:\n\nOk, that's it for now. I'm getting back to coding, I have another meeting with Jan scheduled for today. I keep working on refining my codebook and writing definitions for the codes I decided to keep.\n\n@jan did I put it right?\n\nHave a great day, everybody!", "created_at": "2020-06-30 08:41:34.537883", "updated_at": "2020-07-02 12:03:28.297380", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 420, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 18.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [79560], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49674, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9061, "post_number": 64, "raw": "Def possible with LATEX.

My personal choices are just that ... I offer them as example not as global truth.\n\nHowever I believe that \"walking away from the king\" can be viewed as a more global truth. I believe that anyone who hires EdgeRyders will ultimately experience some kind of repurposing - and int that in doing so will inevitable be joining this movement of moving away from being in servitude towards the powers that be to being in servitude of a higher cause. David Korten mentions that for \"walking away from the king\" to be effective we need to walk away together ... and that is quite a challenge.\n\nI believe <strong>we have to experiment</strong> with how we communicate with our potential clients. My understanding is that if we don't, we may be compromising our own future (at least as EdgeRyders). I view our purpose (as EdgeRyders) is to create an interface between the edge and the mainstream ... to process/filter/digest the edge into a form that can be made available to the mainstream.\n\nThe more time I spend here at EdgeRyders the more I am getting a sense of flow rather than containment. I meet more people I'd like to engage with here but here is not where I would engage with them. I am leaning towards embracing this quality or at least letting it inform us in how to shape EdgeRyders. I have a feeling it would be more valuable for us to enable flow from the edge to the mainstream then to be vested in becoming the source of the flow.

By being a mentor for kids and teenagers I have learned to use my imagination more. Divirgent thinking, playfulness and imagination are things adults forget use sometimes. Communications is something I have learned through years of interdisciplinary academic studies in combination with talking to people everywhere, from different cultures, with different perspectives etc. Visualisation is something i practise by creating art like videos, sculptures, photos etc, and not being afraid of sketching even though I am absolutely terrible at that, also imagination plays an important role when visualising things. To exchange inspiration is also important, I do that by attending various meet-ups, reading books, looking at videos or photos, taking psychogeographic walks, keeping my mind open etc. Metareflection is also important both to understand my own way of thinking and percieving and to understand others and the way they percieve, knowledge in psychology and neuroscience, as well as archaeology, makes me understand people I meet, direct, co-create with and communicate with in everyday life. Being effective is also important, by not postponing what I can do now to another day I try keep my deadlines, because I know there will not be less things to do the day after, by prioritising and organizing i try to do as much as I can, and that is not easy, very often emotions make you prioritize things that might not be the most effective, or that makes it hard for me to pay my bills, there is a balance to this process and still cultural work and social entrepreneurship is not valued properly, we have to collaborate to change those value systems. I am very happy with what I have learned so far, and I also feel that the more I learn the less I know ;) there is always more stuff and interesting knowledge out there and it is really exiting to be a part of that collective mindscape.

Furthermore, the history of movement of the electrons must be accounted for and follow rules set up by the participants. This process culminates in a 4-day festival and role playing game where only the gathered energy can be spent. We\u2019re hoping to build a little solar punk town where this would be played out.\n\nTo guide your imagination, we\u2019re thinking that the rules could for example discourage spending loads of money on a fancy factory bought wind turbine, and encourage something more DIY and upcycled. We might also want to reward ingenuity and aesthetics. It should also be accessible through an \u201ceasy\u201d way out to gain entry - there will be bikes powering generators on which you can spend 8 hours in total in the weeks running up to the event. \n\nTo be clear, this is not an Edgeryders event, but we will be involving the community and the Sci-Fi Economics lab is explicitly mentioned in the application as a network we want to involve.

Retail loyalty programs, website cookies, law enforcement facial recognition software, routine health screening, and airport security lists are all part of the vast presence of different kinds of surveillance in our society. And, these are just the forms that are part of mainstream awareness. What else lurks in the realms where data algorithms are developed, flourish, and get put into practice to drive profit, achieve military or security aims, or control other human behavior? While these technologies are all too often deployed in ways contrary to our individual interests, they have also been used to advance personal and public health, reduce human impact on the environment, and engage citizens in participatory monitoring of the natural world.\n> \n> How can we understand and gain control over these practices, unravelling dystopian connections, and further developing utopian-leaning connections?\n> \n> Possible Themes and Topics\n> \n> How can we play a part in making the design of algorithms and data scraping practices ethically responsible and mindful of individuals and communities? Surveillance has been used to monitor the environment, to track measures to slow environmental degradation, and to secure the elimination of polio. What are other ways science could use surveillance? Are there biological forms of surveillance? Tracking the volume of cell phone usage in a region has helped follow outbreaks of disease and to guide emergency disaster response after earthquakes and hurricanes. How could these kinds of surveillance flourish without leading to massive invasions of privacy? Could we create socially responsible algorithms? Could we create processes for communal participatory design of algorithms and data collection, and create responsive platforms that provide ethical accountability and socially beneficial forms of surveillance? Could we prevent AI surveillance from reinforcing racing and gender divisions?\n> \n> SEND US YOUR PROPOSAL TO BE IN THIS EXHIBITION!\n> \n> Experimentation, provocation, and research are at the heart of Science Gallery Detroit\u2019s values and programs. This exhibition will explore the practice and concept of dystopian and utopian aspects of surveillance, through the lens of artists, psychologists, story tellers, digital gamers, molecular biologists, performers, neuroscientists, designers, computer scientists, nurses, engineers, musicians, mathematicians, architects, and young people. The list of possibilities is endless.\n> \n> Your proposal could be a new or existing artwork, performance, workshop, digital intervention, research project, virtual reality game, or other activity.

As of this week we're looking into how young and not so young people experience learning as a complex process that is not restricted to schooling, rather it expands over our lifespans.\n\nIn times when education systems all across Europe are plagued with decreasing public expenditure, when returns on investments are getting lower and lower, when the value of university diploma is no longer a passport to finding work or to a privileged status, Europeans may have to reconsider the purpose of getting an education. Other sociocultural contexts - from out-of-school mobility programs to work, family and social learning - can prove to be real drivers for gaining the skills and competencies we need to grow into knowledgeable citizens.\n\nWith this in mind, Edgeryders set to discover what learning aspirations and experiences are creating value for young people and should be counted in by policy designers? Learning is a BIG topic, we know. So we've broken it down into a number of small missions (challenges) that you can do on your own, or together with others. Participating is easy! You just pick a mission and follow the simple instructions on the page:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Reality check</strong> - Which skills do you <strong>really</strong> need and how, where, with the help of whom are you learning them?... <em><a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu/t/reality-check/387\">learn more!</a></em></li>\n\n<li><strong>Happiness and education</strong> - What is the real <strong>purpose of education</strong>?... <em><a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu/t/education-happiness/1468\">learn more!</a></em></li>\n\n<li><strong>First lessons in work</strong> - Learning challenges of being <strong>new at the job</strong>... <em><a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu/t/challenge-intro-first-lessons-in-work/376\">learn more!</a></em></li>\n\n<li><strong>The classroom on the wire</strong> - Test drive <strong>online learning</strong>!... <em><a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu/t/challenge-intro-test-drive-online-learning/386\">learn more!</a></em></li>\n\n</ul> \n\nI will leave you with this video illustrating the groundbreaking thesis of <a href=\"http://www.sirkenrobinson.com/\">Sir Ken Robinson</a>.

Last week the wind drove so much smoke up the coast that I retreated to the mountain place.  A few days ago the wind shifted and reversed so that the air in the mountains became dangerous and the air on the coast is ok.\n\nSo yesterday I crossed the state and returned home.

This year already broke the record for total acreage burned by 50% and the largest fire in California history continues to burn on the other side of this county.  If the wind shifts again, I will be out of here seeking better air.\n\nWhat is different this year is how much better the Internet tools are in showing what is happening and what is likely to happen.\n\nThere are several websites that show the details of each big fire in visual and text form.  The main one for the country is InciWeb (https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/). Not a new site, but one that continues to improve.  And there is this newer site,  WiFire (https://firemap.sdsc.edu/) that gives an excellent graphic visual of the various fire perimeters.\n\nAir quality can be monitored by a marvelous citizen-science site, Purple Air (https://www.purpleair.com/map?opt=1/i/mAQI/a10/cC0#8.05/38.734/-122.031). This is a cluster of air quality sensors that report constantly back to the site.  It offers a range of indexes to check to see if large or small particulate matter is in the air.  This site ought to win some sort of award.\n\nAnd I can check wind direction and speed, with an ability to look at future wind prediction at WIndy.com (https://www.windy.com/?2020-09-16-06,36.836,-117.543,6).\n\nAnd I can look at satellite views of the air/smoke content at the NOAA government site, forecast.weather.gov (https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lon=-123.74844&lat=39.26582#.U34NuS_uz9M).  Here is a satellite shot taken a few minutes ago:\n\n![image|690x690](upload://shxgr3Z7iKYP9XR4Dj7jCTKal.jpeg) \nYou can see that the west is under a blanket of smoke but the coast has some blue areas.  I monitor all of these sites during the day and night.\n\nSo, for all the talk about fake news, bad info, social media rotting our brains and all (and last night I watched [\"The Social Dilemma\"](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/) on Netflix, which I highly recommend), it needs to be said that essential tools for citizens to know what is happening in the natural environment without waiting for the news to report it, continues to improve to where one now can have a useful toolkit for making crucial decisions.\n\nThus, I think a \"Net Generation Internet\" should put resources into making such tools better and more available.  Obsessing about Facebook and Amazon and other monopolies is important and necessary, but it is still not the whole picture and hopefully never will be.", "created_at": "2020-09-16 15:33:19.423807", "updated_at": "2020-09-16 15:33:19.423807", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 615, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 74.8, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5538, 8, 1877, 6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17343, "user_id": 43, "topic_id": 1561, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Evidence</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); \">Hello</div><div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); \">Just two things:</div><div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); \">1)\u00a0When I talk about culture in relation to the commons, I'm thinking very broadly.

However, here's a first idea that came up yesterday in a discussion with (the always inspiring) @Yosser:\n\nLet there be a company or group of freelancers who make a living from communicating Medenine to travellers. This is mostly public communication, something close to the heart of many Medeninians in our Social Innovation Camp, and aligned with existing effort such as the upcoming [Medenine tourism promo video](https://www.facebook.com/MEDEvision/videos/809197615925868/) by [Saad](https://www.facebook.com/saadouch.wahabi) and team.\n\nHowever, it would be more encompassing. Ideas for what to include:\n\n* detailed business records on Google Maps and Bing Maps, and preferably also on a self-hosted map based on OpenStreetMap (that serves as the data source for the other two outlets); should include up-to-date opening times and days, photos, reviews, features (such as ATM, currency exchange etc.)\n* a map with interesting places in the surroundings, and how to get there (such as the [Bani Kheddache](https://goo.gl/maps/JGxcBG3KZ6R2) mountains that we visited, but also all the hidden gems inside the city such as the caf\u00e9 and museum in the ksur cave buildings)\n* detailed instructions for practicalities: how the louage taxi system works, what cab rides cost, options to come in from and leave to different cities, travel times, hotel recommendations\n* better maps (basically means OpenStreetMap hacking events where people gather map data together and contribute it to OpenStreetMap and (via change requests) also to Google Maps)\n* good photos with gelolocation (incl. \"photo spheres\"), creating an experience similar to Google StreetView (which is completely absent in Medenine, so \"you can still win\"!) \u2026 and of course we'll want to use only [open source tools for this](https://gis.stackexchange.com/q/80553)\n* product finder: a city-wide searchable database of \"who sells what, who rents what\" \u2026 obviously a lot of work, but also useful for locals\n* a section on stories from Medenine and its surroundings, ideally as links to YouTube videos (\u2026 and they have great stories here, remind me to tell the one with sick sheeps, Coca Cola and small meteorites :laughing:)\n* a section on investing and living in Medenine :-)\n\nSo the basic idea is to \"put Medenine on the digital map\", including all its businesses, but to offer that as a service to the small businesses who still have not much to do with \"the Internet\" but should be able to survive and thrive in the digital age as well.\n\nThe chance I see here is to \"grab\" a share of the travelers coming to Djerba and being bored in their resorts after a few days. It's close enough for a day trip, and others might like to stay for several days as well.\n\nAnd in a more visionary way, the chance is to position Medenine as a progressive \"open data city\": capture and manage your city's data yourself under open licences, don't let Google do it for you. It's still time, because Google has neglected Medenine so far (as per my experience from today, Google Maps covers maybe 50% of ATMs and none of the small businesses).\n\nBudget can come from the following \"paying customers\":\n\n* the city administration (and it should have budget for this, as the southern and interior regions are now a priority in Tunisia's budget)\n* businesses and organizations, for the service of listing their business in Google Maps etc., keeping its information there up to date, and helping the business react to negative reviews (which relieves all the small businesses of the effort of keeping a web presence up to date)\n* travelers, via a simple PayPal donation jar on the information website\n* NGOs and governmental organizations (embassies etc.) supporting the region\n\nOh and:\n\n[quote=\"Yosser, post:3, topic:7935\"]I do believe that Edgeryders and OurGhema can collaborate together in 2018 \u2026 we can have \u2026 something close to the [OpenVillage] Academy \u2026 in Medenine in the future, so it turns into actions, with taking real project ideas or events and working on them[/quote]\n\nThat's a plan, and I think this idea above has already quite some actionable items in it that would provide great learning material for such a camp, including results that are useful for Medenine.

(when speaking to some of them about things it appears they really do care though.)\n\nPeople appear more than happy to give up their power (agency) for an 'easy' life.\u00a0 Is this why representative democracy appears has become considered the way to organise the planet??\n\nI've often wondered about this.\u00a0 Is it human nature - or something to do with our societies.\n\nI'm sure that rights/benefits and responsibilities should come into this somewhere - if you want the benefits, want things to be better, you should take on the responsibilites to make things happen.\n\nAnyway last year someone in the Open Source Ecology Europe network visited an unusual village in Spain, the mayor said he was interested to provide work space for OSE type work.\u00a0 A link to this <a href=\"http://pathsthroughutopia.wordpress.com/2007/12/02/a-utopian-detour/\">blog post</a> got posted to describe the village (I had read about the village before).\u00a0 That blog post is long, but interesting and thought provoking.\n\nLooking through that blog I saw this <a href=\"http://pathsthroughutopia.wordpress.com/2007/10/15/anarchy-in-the-classroom-paidea-merida-extramadura/\">blog post</a> about a school (there is a <a href=\"http://pathsthroughutopia.wordpress.com/2007/10/19/anarchy-in-the-classroom-part-2-paidea-merida-extramadura/\">second part</a> to it).\u00a0 I guess that this blog post could be a bit biased/utopian (pun intended) - but it has really stuck with me and often comes back to me when people talk about education.\u00a0 Giving children power, not treating them as inferior or trying to command them, appears to instill them with crazy amounts of responsibility and the willigness to sort things out for themselves.\u00a0 I often think I should look into all this more but, to date, have not.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-19 10:58:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:25.750199", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 415, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45832, "user_id": 4346, "topic_id": 8717, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Isnt typically the glycerol to maizena ratio much higher, like at least 1:1 and no water? best of luck", "created_at": "2018-06-23 11:07:57.737314", "updated_at": "2018-06-23 11:07:57.737314", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23328, "user_id": 1639, "topic_id": 4443, "post_number": 29, "raw": "<b>:)</b>\n\nHi Alberto, I am participating in EdgeRyders, and I am trying to help, by trying to point to the indirectly addressed roots of these issues, so that they may not consistently recur and consume everyone's time.\n\nSimilarly, in criticising unMonastery's communications, it would be helpful if you could work with us to offer a space more conducive to productive discussion - it's at least partially due to the forms and stalemates of communication I <a href=\"/t/completely-unacceptable/4443/37\">previously mentioned</a> that unMonastery's channels sprawled, in light of the need to find another space for operational work. Much of this has been said before, and we are still working on it. If we can fix communication between us now, I think it will be much easier to keep both endeavors in line of sight.\n\nI appreciate Who Does the Work Calls the Shots, and it can be quite useful for those working very hard to functionally bring forth ideas. I think, however, it does have a breaking point in its ability to invalidate critique: at this point there is very clearly dialogue needed or else the Work itself will breakdown.\n\nIt will breakdown because there is a real tension on the platform - and Edgeryders' members - between creating online reference points and actual dialogue; this is one of the reasons closing comments looks bad. These issues will likely occur in new LBG endeavours as well, is it worth it to keep the \"community\" on board? How can we fix it?\n\nI'm personally looking forward to working on the chances <a href=\"/t/living-on-the-edge-5-athens-late-september-2015/4448\">LOTE5</a> and a <a href=\"/t/stewarding-ourselves-2-non-executive-directors-wanted-for-edgeryders-lbg/4255/42\">preceding facilitation process</a> offer for realignment and discussions on forms of stewardship and capacity.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-24 11:31:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.569370", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 325, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23327], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 76312, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 13409, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Infrastructure and key costs is really where it breaks. I am apalled at how little resilience small food businesses have, and how quick they are failing when they **can't cover their fixed costs** in a crisis. What are the lessons food entrepreneurs can learn? everyone is taught to have a business and financial plan, but those numbers cannot prepare you for steady financial reserves in times of plummeting sales. So how should you then run your food project in a financially sustainable way - what are the no nos? In a country like Belgium where support is offered in regional subsidies, can they be used in a smart way?  \n\nThere are examples of shared infrastructure but they are also commercially aligned - like professional kitchens. Some of them are more community oriented than others, but there are of course other sets of problems which they can pose.

Don't believe in hype, just go and do. Long version: there's a debate in the startup scene, where the search for funds is a fundamental, often crucial option. Of course, considering the funding as the main goal is a total mistake - it's only the beginning, a mean to an end. As somebody said: \"Build a business, not a product\". But, at the same time, it's often an important choice if you wanna have a broad scope and build for scalability - as opposite to \"build for sustainability\" that means go for the revenue in the short term. We at <a href=\"http://www.blomming.com\">http://www.blomming.com</a> are an example of this. We are a platform that helps people to create an e-commerce on their existing environments - blogs, websites, facebook pages. If you have a business, bring it online selling to your community. Are we in the Social Innovation space? Not exactly. We consider ourself a platform apt (also) for social innovation projects. But we're a platform, so we had to put the basis for Scalability. We won't be able to sustain ourselves for a long time.</span>\n\n<span>So what? So, it really depends on the kind of business you're in. Need huge numbers in order to make your plan work? Then you'll need funding. Can you make few dollars from the first 1.000 customers? Then your\u00a0model is proven and you can try to go for sustainability.</span>\n\n<span>Two funny notes:\u00a0</span>Douglas Rushkoff (Cyberia,\u00a0Program Or Be Programmed) made a fantastic speech a couple years ago againt scalability and in favour of sustainability (\"scale what? scale this, m*f*!!!\" :), here:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.infoservi.it/douglas-rushkoff-program-or-be-programmed-video/6611\">http://www.infoservi.it/douglas-rushkoff-program-or-be-programmed-video/6611</a>.

I am preparing two game designs for 2 different design contests. One is a very easy and fast 2 player head to head card game based on kickboxing (I think I will later retheme it into something very fun to make it more family friendly). It has 54 cards, 2x A4 pages of rules and requires any kind of coins or similar to keep track of points in rounds.\n\nLet me know if it's something you would like to try out :slight_smile:. Already have few friends playing it but it's really good to get more eyes on it and hear different opinions.\n\nGame dynamic is a bit like Uno. You can connect combos, the opponent can dodge, block and counterhit. There is an exchange of initiative and the player hand actually represents his fatigue. Less cards you have, more tired you are, therefor have much less options in combat. It forces you to rest (in real kickbox it would be like keeping distance and letting the opponent take initiative). Each time you give the initiative to the opponent you draw cards. If you do it more times in a row, you draw +1 card each time. So first time you draw 1, but third time you draw 3 cards.\n\nThere are also effects like KO, dazed or breathless. Breathless for example makes you discard a card and it happens if an opponent landed a 3-hit combo and the last hit was in your body.\n\nThere you go, in short :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2020-09-17 17:06:18.515255", "updated_at": "2020-09-17 17:06:18.515255", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 265, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [82195], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21919, "user_id": 433, "topic_id": 1296, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Thanks John! :)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-30 13:03:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:02.157172", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11079, "user_id": 1692, "topic_id": 2732, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>2 axis vs 1 axis</b>\n\nWhat really matters is that the solar trackers follows the sun from west to east (azimuth).

After all, most people do not speak Polish *and* Czech *and* Serbian *and* English, so those fora are populated by different participants. It would not be surprising if the debates in different languages went in different directions. Do they?\n\nI can see two approaches to this question. One is mathematical; the other is visual. \n\nMathematically, it's not rocket science. You can think of the codes co-occurrence graph as a vector. Every element of the vector is an edge between two codes. If the two codes are disconnected (there is no edge), the corresponding element of the vector is 0. If they are connected by co-occurrence in *k* posts, the corresponding element of the vector is *k*. Given this, you can compute a scalar measure of distance (Euclidean, or cosine) between two vectors representing two fora, for example the Polish and the Czech. That would give you a number. To know whether this number is \"high\" (very dissimilar networks) or \"low\" (very similar networks), you can then compare the distance between the two observed vectors with the distance between either of them and a random network with the same degree distribution. If the former distance is much smaller than the latter, then you are have a proximity which is difficult to explain by random chance. This could be a sign of convergence between the two debates, but also a signature of the coding team's work.\n\nThe visual approach simply draws the network. I find it potentially more generative for an anthropologist, because you can then burrow into *which* codes are shared across the different fora, and reflect on what this commonality might mean. Here is the POPREBEL codes co-occurrence network for *k > =3*.  Color coding maps to the language forum, as follows:\n\nRed => Czech\nBlue => Polish \nGreen => International\nOrange => Serbian\nGrey => nodes that belong to more than one forum \n\n![image|690x414](upload://qoeZlJxPh6nPx8FbgSonw7mK0if.png) \n\nI built this version of the network representing the co-occurrences in different language fora as different edges. So, if `code1` and `code2` co-occur once in the Polish forum and twice in the international forum, I represent this with one blue edge with *k=1* and one green edge with *k=2*. Graphryder would only draw a single edge, with *k = 1+2 = 3*. This means that there are no grey edges, though there is a fairly large group of grey nodes at the center. We can see it better by hiding the edges:\n\n ![image|690x414](upload://scuevTlqixI0AltGyJVOCIRzZpo.png) \n\nAnother trick is to show the edges, but this time coloring them by interpolation of the color of the extremes. This means that, if both extremes are red, the edge will also be red; but if the edge connects a red node with a gray one, the edge will start off red and turn to gray as it approaches the grey one. Doing this shows a network of highly connected grey nodes at the center. \n\n![image|690x414](upload://m69LK3LcjD4W52eVubU2KkSfmkS.png) \n\nYou can toggle these views on and off by playing with the buttons at the bottom of the node/link diagram window in Tulip.\n\nThe grey might be deceiving, because some nodes are *mostly* in one forum, with only few links to others. To explore this, I suggest turning off the color interpolation, zooming in if necessary, and turning on the \"Highlight node neighborhood\" interactor, on the top of the node-link diagram window. Hovering over nodes reveal their connections; clicking on them locks that view in place, while you can move your mouse elsewhere. This method reveals, for example, that `corruption` is incident to edges in the Czech, Polish and international forum; on the other hand, `polarization political` is incident only to Polish debate edges (at least for *k>=3*). \n\n![image|690x414](upload://f3SJwgScbsBMHWwpJGisXdsAOXI.png) \n\n![image|690x414](upload://wIeIEvN9HZQAyj4FotAXS4AJVDq.png) \n\nFinally, I decided to make a separate subgraph which consists only of the codes that are shared across two or more fora, and of the edges connecting them. It consists of 232 nodes and 5,645 edges. If we only take its subgraph where *k >= 3* we are left with 180 nodes and 636 edges. It looks like this (I made the Polish edges a darker shade of blue so it's easier to read the labels): \n\n![image|690x414](upload://yob45bLOT7VVuGL7haTQmwG0rut.png)  \n\nI encourage you to play with the graphs. You can download the Tulip perspective from [here](https://github.com/edgeryders/network-viz-for-ssna/blob/master/code/special%20cases/poprebel_2.tlpx). The graphs of most interest to you are `composite` (all fora together) and `intersection` (all fora together, but only the nodes that are shared across two or more fora). For both I have already computed all the subgraphs at different levels of *k*. \n\nUnfortunately, applying a layout algorithm to one graph messes up with the others, but no fear: only at the visualization level. Now the layout is optimized for subgraph `k = 003` of  `intersection`. If you want a pretty layout of another graph, a quick way to do it is the following: \n\n1. Download the script `[d1_layout.py](https://github.com/edgeryders/network-viz-for-ssna/blob/master/code/python%20scripts/d1_layout.py)`(you may have to click on the \"Raw\" button and then \"save page\"). \n1. select the graph you are interested in, in the graph list on the left. ![image|690x361](upload://7WBZm1WzyXxSEjM5KwHO3b2E5pn.jpeg) \n\n2. Open the Python IDE clicking on the `Python` button on the left.\n3. Click on the `Load` button in the IDE and select the script you just downloaded. \n4. Select the graph you want to prettify from the top bar in the IDE. ![image|690x443](upload://pzM0csW5xvBzUvh7YzjqyRMnBaW.jpeg) \n5. Click on the \"Play\" icon in the IDE (bottom right) to run the layout script on your graph. \n\nYou can also just play with Tulip's layout algorithms. You will find them on the top left of your Tulip window. \n\nHave fun! @amelia @Wolha @Jan @Richard @Jirka_Kocian", "created_at": "2020-12-19 15:38:41.054662", "updated_at": "2020-12-19 15:38:55.666234", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1028, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 47.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323, 4794], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47946, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9106, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4039797c08d396443eb24c924d1625fde942cc2c.png\" width=\"326\" height=\"89\">\nIn early November Edgeryders Noemi Salantiu, Alex Levene and John Coate will travel to the Croatian city of Rijeka, on the4 Istrian coast, to conduct a community building workshop in support of their status as a European Capital of Culture in 2020.\n\nRijeka has already created a number of projects for Rijeka 2020 (https://rijeka2020.eu/en/) including building a dynamic new community and cultural center, the RiHub, the similar Brick House, and numerous cultural and civic initiatives such as Energana Incubator, Seasons of Power, Green Wave and 27 Neighbourhoods.\n\nRijeka 2020 organizers wish to use an online community network to tie all of these projects together in order to increase visibility, foster collaboration and develop an ongoing way for people to come together in ways that increase the permanence of their many initiatives.\n\nThis is where Edgeryders comes in.  They asked us to give a two-day workshop on the steps required to organize, build and grow a healthy online community.  The workshop consist of presentations, Q&A, analyzing and selecting a platform, active real-time collaboration on developing a working terms of Service, advice on generating public awareness, and advice on managing a growing community.  Much of the focus will be on the 27 Neighbourhoods project. We will work with ten of the neighbourhood representatives, helping them shape Rijeka 2020 online so that it increases fulfillment of their goals.  \n\nThe workshop will take place in Rijeka on November 5-6.", "created_at": "2018-10-16 18:16:00.616163", "updated_at": "2018-10-17 18:00:26.073905", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 255, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 368.8, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3067, 4, 3904, 3, 4723, 4722], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2771, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 2738, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2014-04-16 07:01:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:15.072905", "deleted_at": "2017-08-07 09:41:35.277671", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34042, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 2738, "post_number": 3, "raw": "", "created_at": "2017-08-07 09:40:08.537700", "updated_at": "2017-08-07 09:40:08.537700", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3751, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3718, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Edgeryders gave a short presentation at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.baumhausberlin.de/events/emergent-berlin/\">Emergent Berlin</a>\u00a0festival on 16 August 2014.

In Greece there is no support.

Kids that they may or may not have things in common with.\n\n<a href=\"/u/jamesl\">@JamesL</a> came up with a possible solution, why not create that *thing* they have in common in the form of a game.

No matter where we draw the line between them, their project will always be perceived by the local population as an unMonastery project; Therefore, part of what we have developed here as our aesthetic code applies to them. This means the following:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Elf\u2019s point about Open Budgeting (seconded by Alberto) - has become an intrinsic part of the trust we all build upon. Viral Academy needs to make its finances public.</li>\n\n<li>Each unMonasterian has effectively been working on two different set of problems: one is the challenge(s) their projects address; the second is the unMonastery itself.

In-house we have tried to develop ways to live and work together, to become a community, to make decisions and to support each other.

David and Ksenia should be encouraged to pick up an aspects of the unMonasterians\u2019 way of living and take responsibility for upholding it and developing it in their new reality.

Lots to think about here. I would add as an unMonastery specificity the\u00a0<strong>monastic metaphor<em>,</em></strong>\u00a0and that is not just a source of cool aesthetics. It impinges on the economic model, which tends to be non-labor market. But that does not mean non-market altogether: monasteries always had economic exchanges, both in kind and in cash, with the surrounding communities.\n\nIn general, there are two incorrect things with your formal reconstruction of the flow of money: one is that citizens of Matera pay the Italian state, not the city of Matera. After a big and complex distribution (which lowers significantly the Gini coefficient of the Italian economy), Italians as a whole end up funding all local government, including Matera and \u2013 more significantly \u2013 the Basilicata Region. Region and City Hall fund Comitato. Next, Comitato passes somemoney onto Edgeryders which passes it onto unMonasterians (not the unMonastery, that is not a legal entity).\u00a0\n\nWe actually tried not to route this money through Edgeryders. Originally we designed the collaboration between MT2019 and Edgeryders as one where no money would be involved, kind of elf-style: we would do something together, but nobody would pay anybody \u2013 MT2019 would directly issue the stipends to the unMonasterians. But then MT2019 got really, really stuck in administration. They refused to pass on money onto unMonasterians without contracts and it all got complicated. Edgeryders offered to do the contracting/invoicing stuff and pass the money onto Ben for communal management. Edgeryders does not withhold any of that money for itself, we pass 100% onto the unMonastery.\u00a0\n\nThis has been a significant source of trouble for us because of a lot of oversight. We would much rather not have to do the man-in-the-middle thing \u2013 but I am not sure it is realistic. Ben knows more about this.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-20 23:01:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:57.901091", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 335, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86262, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14712, "post_number": 12, "raw": "If you tell me what you want, I may be able to produce a viz for you.", "created_at": "2020-11-04 10:16:16.755684", "updated_at": "2020-11-04 10:16:16.755684", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [86261], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55870, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9712, "post_number": 22, "raw": "Update: we had the preparation call for the Skunkworks on 2019-06-27 as scheduled. Present:\n\n1. @sander\n1. @Jan\n1. @Richard\n1. @melancon\n1. @hugi\n1. @noemi\n1. @alberto\n\nWe used the call to:\n\n* Introduce each of us to the others, and take stock of the different skills that will be in the room in Brussels.\n* Align expectations as to how we will work together during the Skunkworks. \n\nSome highlights:\n\n* Sander told us of his experience in coordinating 65 researchers from disciplines ranging from theoretical physics to literature history. \n\n> We had to spend the first year relinquishing our professional identities. That is a hard thing to ask, since we did not have new ones yet, so we just waded into unknown waters. Strange things happened, and people found it hard and frustrating to even talk with each other. I remember one meeting about desertification: after hours of discussion, we realized that the English-speaking people thought we were talking of ecological collapse, and the French-speaking people thought we were talking about abandoning urban areas.\n\n* To get over the hump and into the benefits of transdisciplinarity, we agreed to be patient, give each other plenty of time to make our points, and keep expectations low. Sander also recommended lots of food and drinking. @marina and I will think of some place where we can break bread together once in Brussels. \n\n* Sander also gave us an indication as to what we are looking for in the skunkworks. We are looking for **research questions that are sufficiently concrete for us to latch on to with a strategy for attempting an answer; but sufficiently abstract for people across all disciplines to supply intuitions and models** (I am paraphrasing, Sander please correct me if I'm wrong).\n\n* In operational terms, the program (scroll to the top of this topic) stands. We start from the concrete problem of European populism, in the first session; then we share our ideas for a scaled-up, math-assisted ethnography, in the second one; and finally we try to superimpose the two, and see if there is a fit. We agreed that the presentations will have no set time, and people are allowed (end encouraged) to interrupt the speaker: we don't move to the next point until we all have understood the current one.\n\nPing also @amelia and @martin who were not in the call.", "created_at": "2019-06-28 20:48:40.882468", "updated_at": "2019-06-28 20:48:40.882468", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 398, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 28.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1228, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1195, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Brief overview of Lote progress:\n\nWe launched the event with\u00a0a call for commitment 3 weeks ago, which resulted in 27 participants registered so far, team included.

And we could also test various options of documenting such a project while making it.\n\nHere is the short notes we've been writing while discussing the project @SyMorin @unknown_author and I.\nMAIN GOAL:\ncreation of a meshnet for the edgeryders community there. Such a network could also serve the making and creation of content / media / data network such as an independant radio, maps of any kind, graphs, etc.\nMAIN IDEA:\nimprovement of the community ability to map / study / share openly / and work, on a local scale basis.\nMAIN INSIGHT:\nbringing an anthropographic vision and purpose to such a project, to be able to go beyond the simple journalism / story telling (without shutting it down though) aspect.\nMAIN ROLES:\n@unknown_author being the bridge between tech and content, managing the abilities of the firsts and the needs of the others, balancing both in order to improve the project the best way. Also, and of course, reporting, photo-anthrpographically, the work and results there.\n@SyMorin could be a \"reference\" in terms of creating a radio medium: what's needed technically, what could be the options in terms of formats, angles, startegies, ...\n@gregoiremarty aka me, could help Sy on the radio medium creation, and also drive the anthropographic insight behind such a project, and picture/imagine/look for the next steps to bring content / medias / datas for the platform. (for instance, checking how the local food cycle is working, since this is one of my favorite topic).\n+ anybody who wants to join the team, of course, with the ability to second or help out on a specific aspect, or bring a fourth/fifth element to the combination.\n\nMy first reco now, is to avoid any \"too much thinking + too much visions + too much ambitions\" to such a project. I see it more efficient if it's small and local, at the beginning. That's the best way to avoid issues, but also to let the project itself and the (local) community in the best conditions to conduct it the best way for THEM (wich is more important than for anybody in particular).\nIt also appears to me that such a project needs to stay very practical, and connected to realities and concrete things (food cycle is quite a good example think) rather than ideas or ideologies, editorial content, etc etc. But do I need to say such a thing here anyways? :slight_smile:\n\nlet me know what you think,\ncheers!", "created_at": "2017-12-17 21:15:44.497877", "updated_at": "2018-03-09 19:23:18.041080", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 511, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 129.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3818, 4211], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83705, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 14371, "post_number": 5, "raw": "[quote=\"hugi, post:1, topic:14371\"]it\u2019s basically an idea to make a solarpunk larp/festival to which you could only get a ticket by trading in stored energy or the potential of generating energy at the event[/quote]\n\nFor inspiration, take a look at [The Human Powered Student Building](https://www.humanpowerplant.be/human_power_plant/human-powered-student-building-plans.html), an artistic concept for converting a 750-room student building to be powered and heated by human power alone.\n\nOr for more practical insights, there's a (great as always) Low-Tech Magazine article \"[Could We Run Modern Society on Human Power Alone?](https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2017/05/could-we-run-modern-society-on-human-power-alone.html)\".", "created_at": "2020-09-24 16:46:56.682562", "updated_at": "2020-09-24 16:46:56.682562", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 121, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 21.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [82877], "is_reply_to": [82877], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12847, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5247, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Here it is </b>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a5af403d76c97111726438afaf34349c9d1531ee.jpg\" width=\"658\" height=\"500\">\n\nThe \"Edit\" tab is above the LOTE5 logo.\u00a0<a href=\"/u/markomanka\">@markomanka</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-11 14:45:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:12.937684", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 58, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12386], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82472, "user_id": 6455, "topic_id": 14322, "post_number": 3, "raw": "@noemi, @jonnycosgrove, @Berniejmitchell, @CormacMcCann, \n@robertkropp, @syncaroo, @@JvdLinden,@WomenCo\n\nThis may be of interest to you", "created_at": "2020-08-28 16:06:08.942444", "updated_at": "2020-08-28 16:06:08.942444", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 8.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [82471], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50769, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9460, "post_number": 16, "raw": "[quote=\"alex_levene, post:15, topic:9460\"]\nWanted to ask if you'd explored the option of registering with Google for Non-profits?: https://www.google.com/nonprofits/offerings/apps-for-nonprofits.html\n[/quote]\n\nI hadn't.

What do I need to prepare? he general introduction to Poprebel?\n[/quote]\n\nI would like you to help the ethno/netsci people in the room to sink their teeth into populism, and specifically in the research questions about populism that you most care about. Together, we need to find out if, and how, we can push our methodological edge by going out on a limb in the general direction of digital ethnography, and what this would buy us. The outcome is one or more proposed improvements to our methods. Such improvements could be in the realm of coding practices (province of @amelia and Sander himself); software to reaggregate the data (province of @melancon and @hugi); or, most likely, a combination of the two. \n\nTo give you an example, at the latest ethnography training, Amelia revealed that some ethnographers like to code \"multidimensionally\". For example, you might have a set of codes related to semantics proper, and another one related to emotional states. Mathematically we can represent this state of affairs with something called a multilayer network. There would be a layer of semantic codes, and a layer of emotional codes. Codes are connected by co-occurrence both within and across layers. So, in principle you could look at how different codes or sets of codes in one layer connect _preferentially_ to codes or sets of codes in the other layer. If you were doing an ethnography underpinning Polanyi's _Great Transformation_ with this method, you would expect to find codes like `market`, `self-regulation` and so on (on the semantic layer) preferentially linking to codes expressing dread and anxiety on the emotional layer. \n\nPlease, understand this semantic/emotional layer partition is totally arbitrary, and just comes from the particular example that Amelia did during that training. I am just trying to give you an idea for where we are trying to get. \n\nSo, in all this your job is to represent the issue of populism to people who know far less than you, and explain what you are looking for, and troubleshoot any wild idea that people might come up with. You and @Richard are the issue owners. But you will not speak for three hours. Take as much time as you need to introduce populism and what makes it so interesting, but no more. We will then, together, try to find a digital ethnography angle of attack.

EU leaders have agreed to a comprehensive package of \u20ac1 824.3 billion which combines the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and an extraordinary recovery effort under the Next Generation EU (NGEU) instrument. The MFF, reinforced by Next Generation EU, will also be the main instrument for implementing the recovery package to tackle the socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe size of the MFF - \u20ac1 074.3 billion - will allow the EU to fulfill its long-term objectives and preserve the full capacity of the recovery plan. New proposal brings some changes and cuts in the areas of health, migration, external action, InvestEU, HORIZON. The Just Transition Fund has been more than halved to \u20ac17.5bn - from the \u20ac40bn proposed in May by the EU Commission. \nNext steps: European Parliament must give its consent to the next long-term EU budget.\n![EUbudget 2021-2027|680x489](upload://jQzWeItvknOmISXd0sSnI2gS8Tr.jpeg) \n\n**Recovery fund**\n\nNext Generation EU will provide the Union with the necessary means to address the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the agreement the Commission will be able to borrow up to \u20ac **750 billion** on the markets. These funds may be used for back-to-back loans and for expenditure channelled through the MFF programmes. Capital raised on the financial markets will be repaid by 2058. \u20ac390 billion from the package will be distributed in the form of grants to member states and \u20ac360 billion in loans.\n\nThe amounts available under NGEU will be allocated to seven individual programmes:\n\n* Recovery and Resilience Facility (RFF)\n* ReactEU\n* Horizon Europe\n* InvestEU\n* Rural Development\n* Just Transition Fund and\n* RescEU.\n\n**Allocation from the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF)**\n\nThe plan ensures the money goes to the countries and sectors most affected by the crisis: **70%** under the grants of the Recovery and Resilience Facility will be committed in **2021** and **2022** and **30%** will be committed in **2023** .\n\nAllocations from the RRF in 2021-2022 will be established according to the Commission\u2019s allocation criteria taking into account member states' respective living standards, size and unemployment levels.\n\nFor 2023 allocations, **the unemployment criterion** will be replaced by the drop in GDP in 2020 and 2021.\n\n**Governance and conditionality**\n\nIn line with the principles of good governance, member states will prepare **national recovery and resilience plans** for 2021-2023 **.** These will need to be consistent with the **country-specific recommendations** and contribute **to green and digital transitions.** More specifically, the plans are required to boost growth and jobs and reinforce the \"economic and social resilience\" of EU countries. The plans will be reviewed in 2022. The assessment of these plans will be approved by the Council by a qualified majority vote on a proposal by the Commission. The disbursement of grants will take place only if the agreed milestones and targets set out in the recovery and resilience plans are fulfilled.\n\nIf, exceptionally, one or more member states consider that there are serious deviations from the satisfactory fulfillment of the relevant milestones and targets, they may request that the President of the European Council refer the matter to the next European Council.\n\n#### **Climate action**\n\n30% of the total expenditure from the MFF and Next Generation EU will target **climate-related projects** . Expenses under the MFF and Next Generation EU will comply with the EU\u2019s objective of climate neutrality by 2050, the EU\u2019s 2030 climate targets and the Paris Agreement.\n\n#### **Rule of law**\n\nThe Union's financial interests will be protected in accordance with the general principles embedded in the Union Treaties, in particular the values referred to in Article 2 TEU. The European Council also underlines the importance of the respect of the rule of law. Based on this background, a regime of conditionality to protect the budget and Next Generation EU will be introduced.\n\n#### **Rebates**\n\nLump sum rebates on the annual gross national income-based contribution will be maintained for **Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden** .\n\n#### **Own resources**\n\nEU leaders agreed to provide the EU with new resources to pay back funds raised under Next Generation EU. They agreed on a new plastic levy that will be introduced in 2021. In the same year the Commission is expected to put forward a proposal for a carbon adjustment measure and a digital levy, both of which would be introduced by the end of 2022.\n\nThe Commission would then come back with a revised proposal on the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS), possibly extending it to the aviation and maritime sectors. There may also be other new resources, such as a financial transaction tax. The proceeds of the new own resources introduced after 2021 will be used for early repayment of NGEU borrowing.\n\nA \u20ac5 billion **Brexit reserve** will be established to support the member states and economic sectors hardest hit by Brexit.\n\n\n[European Council conclusions, 17-21 July 2020](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45109/210720-euco-final-conclusions-en.pdf)", "created_at": "2020-07-23 11:32:20.016023", "updated_at": "2020-07-23 13:08:46.740550", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 842, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 237.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84685, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13988, "post_number": 177, "raw": "@Jan, @Wojt, are either of you joining us today?", "created_at": "2020-10-09 13:03:37.049447", "updated_at": "2020-10-09 13:03:37.049447", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [84684], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19937, "user_id": 1867, "topic_id": 2829, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>so cool to find you here</b>\n\nhey!\n\nIt's great that you posted about your project on Edgeryders;\u00a0we met at the flat6 networking event..I was with the UNDP team.\n\n<span>Anyway, basically just to give you a quick overview of Spot the Future, we're working with Edgeryders to find new ways to connect to people like you, doing interesting things that we don't know about.

If maslow was here, he wont really like what i am about to say, buuut I don't think the Maslow hierarchy applies in our current world. I think our needs have developed with the changes of how we percieve our current world, so we cant really say that untill poor people are fed, they will start caring about issues like the environment. You see all the taxi, tuk tuk drivers in Egypt, you wouldnt categorise them within the middle or high class, but they do spend alooot of time, money and energy on personalising their cars; a need that doesn't belong to the bottom of Maslow's pyramid. It might be that customisation is an important need, or may be that people are relatively motivated after all, or it could be that our needs have developed and the layering of Maslow's pyramid have shuffled. So conclusion, we should not assume what people want or need before actually, prototyping our idea and actually testing it, and the results would speak louder i guess</span>.\n\n<span>As for the second thought, this would be about why we dont or wont collaborate in Egypt. At <span>Reform Studio</span>, i would say that yes competition is sometimes discussed as a concern, and for us, as designers who have created an innovative \"award wining\" new material, our concern stems from the absolute lack of awareness of the existence of intellectual property rights in Egypt. That said, we are aware that an idea alone is nothing, it's how you'll implement and grow your initiative.

In  Upper Egypt, there are already alternative schools - the challenge there and in the rest of the country might be to find and appropriate all empty spaces like mosques, abandoned factories, etc which are currently under-utilised and can be relatively easily converted to schools.\n\nCurrently, most people/parents afraid to speak up and express their frustration about public schooling and hoping it will change; it's a usual practice to have teachers beat kids in public schools, allegedly in the name of discipline.\n\nDue to a confluence of some political and cultural factors, education in Egypt started degrading since the end of 1980s and beginning 1990s. People at that time were also looking at schools that fit better for their kids.\n\n----------\n##:ar: _Arabic version_ <a name=\"ar\"></a>\n\n[b] \u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0645

I have worked on various projects ranging from ecological restoration stories, stories of violence and safety, community care, global health, etc.\n\nAt the moment I'm writing an article on how social media is being hijacked by civic society to play to the imaginations of their audiences, to mobilize funds, reputation, networks etc. My argument is that the stories told online (in my interaction with these specific civic structures/ngos) hardly mimics the lived experience or the focus of that entity, and can be considered authentic and inauthentic simultaneously.  Im doing so by discussing some case studies. I am completely sure many people wont like it BUT...\n\nI agree with @unknown_author that these stories would mobilize and inspire a new generation, as I've seen it in my space in the context of public health.

The \"new forms of Innovation\" as imbecile as the\u00a0 sounds, will have to go beyond producing gadgets, probably that is what they mean by \"new forms\". Now, what I do know, is that it will be about inclusion, yes, and the EU commissions perspective on the issue is mostly that exclusion is caused by unemployment, poverty and poor education. I would suggest that, whenever somebody or something is excluded, the main reason is that the \"mainstream\" wants to exclude certain groups of people because they don't know how to handle them, and they experience \"cognitive dissonance\" when they are confronted with \"otherness\", people who live on the street and not in homes, people who -temporarily - don't work, or people who do work that doesn't look like work, or whatever. From this kind of exclusion, it is sometimes a small step to criminalization, as recent events in Hungary show:\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24347061\n\nI think, a first step would be to reframe completely what we consider exclusion. We can see ourselves as excluded from them, which means, we can desire to live like they do, and see what it feels like: Live on the streets, live without money: Is there anything to be learned from them? I think there is, actually, there's a lot to be learned. So, to be a bit more practical (as you very politely insist us to be, rightly so, Alberto), I would suggest to create a learning platform: \"The academy of the excluded\" What can we learn from them?

I believe trust is part of human nature, not something you learn while you grow up, so something in Egypt makes people lose their capacity of trusting each other. It forces people to be individual (indifferent is perhaps a better word?) and only care about themselves. It is also expressed in the lack of care for the environment, the garbage, the plastic bottles etc. I think trust is the glue that binds a society together and makes it strong.\"</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>", "created_at": "2014-05-06 19:36:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:56.652827", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 440, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16265, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 2859, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Hi Edgesense, nice to meet ya :)</b>\n\nNice clean and informative interface ...

But, I don't want the data source we use for that dumped into the public as a non-anonymized research data package. We encourage people to use their real names as usernames, and many do, so this is indeed sensitive if combined with a computer-understandable version of what they say (RDFa is getting near it ...), in a big old data dump.. That's why I said, if you include usernames etc., make the views access restricted. It's admittedly a matter of principle at this early stage of this fast-growing platform ;) but, remember our discussion about semantic data privacy we had near the end of the Edgeryders 1 site.\n\nRe. early content appearing as being written by the community, here's a rough guess about what happened: when migrating the Drupal 6 content over, user IDs changed. So in case you stored IDs to identify which content was created by staff, you gotta update these to the new ones. (There's still a <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">legacy_id</code> field containing the old one, but I guess it's simpler to find out by searching for users.)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-30 18:34:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:44.359456", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 245, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29854], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30729, "user_id": 932, "topic_id": 2859, "post_number": 39, "raw": "<b>Data inconsistencies + problems with services_views</b>\n\n@Matthias I think I have identified the source of the problems with the data which make the visualization misbehave:\n\nthere are many users (all of those that were imported?) which have a creation date which is in the future wrt some of the content they have created. e.g. @Alberto has a create date (timestamp) of:\u00a0<span>1359233500 which is in Jan 2013 BUT there are posts older than that from him.

Once in a while, they would share bits and pieces of memories from all the way from Vietnam to Germany: How my grandmother took my mother to the docks in the middle of the night. The boats. The sea. How my father was captured by the Navy. The \"re-education camp\". The second try... the good people at the boarding home they were allowed to stay at. Fellow refugee children they made friends with. Attending school in a totally foreign language at day. Learning that very foreign language in the evenings. Working - and eventually not only being able to make their own living, but being able to make another person's living as well - in other words, not only having a child, but ensuring a safe and promising future for that child.\n\nThat being told, I must confess, I couldn't imagine how it must be to find oneself in such a situation. If I don't know their needs and wishes, how could I possibly dare saying that I'm helping with whatever I think that would help them?\n\nIf a refugee wishes for work, it almost automatically seems like a matter of impossibility: <em>\"We cannot even provide our own people with jobs, how do you think you would fit into that picture?\" </em>Maybe, that was a misunderstanding. Maybe, what was meant was rather: \"<em>I'm tired of sitting around all day. I want to feel useful again. I don't want to be helped only. I also want to be in a position of helping others!\"</em>\n\nI once helped supplying refugees with clothes. Our group of volunteers carried box after box and it would happen that some of the refugees ask to help <em>us. </em>We would refuse their offers and told them that it's okay to go rest and let us do the work.\n\nI didn't realise at that time that we treated them like children, belittling them, taking their integrity and giving them the feeling of uselessness. Out of arrogant goodwill.\n\nSo how can we care, without degrading them? How can we help re-establishing self-esteem and self-awareness, instead of belittling them? It's clear that they know better about their situation than we do, so how can we support them in finding their own solutions and learn from them, instead of imposing our solutions on something that we have absolutely no clou of?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-15 09:50:10", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 05:31:25.898360", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 453, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 21.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53573, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9916, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![Tip_General-Newsletter|690x262](upload://dXX4caveIFOwEspYd8qQV9RSsiK.jpeg) \n\nThe lovely @matteo_uguzzoni launched this invitation for all who are interested, have a look and hurry to get a spot? :-) \n\n**We are going to talk about MONEY and SUSTAINABILITY.

The trick was to get services_views to return the output of the view, as shown in the preview, which happens to be a JSON document itself. This is done with the <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">format_output</code> parameter (normally used to get a HTML rendered view returned).\n\nTo be sure, I also specified the display in the URL now (as so far it always used the Master display). And I set the JSON output to be pretty-printed in the views' options for JSON data document. Reset that if you want, but I guess it's better for debugging purposes right now. There's also an option for not escaping forward slashes at the same place, if you want that.\n\n<em>Update:</em> For future reference, I provided more info about the <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\">format_output=1</code> solution as a <a href=\"https://drupal.org/node/678202#comment-8843275\">comment in Drupal issue \"Views does not return taxonomy for Services\"</a>. It seems that the services_views authors propose to use a \"Global: PHP\" field and custom code for pulling in multi-value fields [<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=DZEhJKMeR5w#t=296\">source</a>].

Our team is working in the Hacking Utopia project at UDK (University of Arts) in Berlin. We are two product designers and two communication students.\n\nMain target group are refugees why we mostly talked to young men from syria. Of course they are facing a lot of problems and some are probably more serious tha the one we are trying to solve. We found out that -waiting for german bureaucracy to give them the needed papers and learning german- a lot of them feel lost in their new environment. Although our focus is on refugees Newcomer is for everyone, who is new in the city.\n\nOur App combines different types of challenges in a city-rally taking place in Berlin. They make them explore the town and talk to people. So for exapmple it asks them to take a photo of something, that reminds them of their origin. Also we are inviting Institutions like Bars, Caf\u00e9s and Eventspaces be a part of our project. So for example we lead a participant to a caf\u00e9 and ask him to drink a coffee with someone. Both drinks are half priced so they get in contact by using this discound. With a growing community different app-users could match and meet to solve tasks together and have a nice experience.\n\nSo our app definitely is no tourist guide. It is more like a motivation-tool to go out and socialize. In two weeks we are starting a crouwdfunding-campaign on start next. Until then we clarify our concept and test it with people.

These medical camps are led by Nepalese professionals who are assisted by qualified volunteers and medical and dentistry students from the UK.\n\nThe long and expensive journey to the hospitals in Laksha and Kathmandu (sometimes taking days) are out-of-reach for the majority living in these low-income communities. Their main source of income is from subsistence farming and small profits are often shared throughout the community. So as you can imagine, when word gets out that these clinics are nearby, villagers flock to them in the hope of securing a cure for their health issues.\n\n\u00a0There are currently no permanent doctors in the region, which is home to a large, ethnically diverse population, spread over a number of rural communities made up of low income households. People lack access to basic health care and specialist treatment and have to walk for many days to attend the nearest hospital or else take the long and expensive journey to Kathmandu. The medical camps provide free consultation, treatment and advice from specialist qualified doctors as well as access to free medication.\u00a0The goal is to one day provide the communities in these remote Himalayan villages with permanent medical care and qualified staff, rather than a temporary clinic run from an outbuilding of Bupsa\u2019s monastery.\n\nThe group that started the initiative were limited to leftover equipment from the previous clinics\u00a0and a small amount of supplies that they carried in with them.\u00a0 One of the most common problems witnessed were musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). MSDs are a widely spread problem facing porters and farming communities who endure hard physical labour day-in-day-out. Muscles, joints, tendons, ligaments and nerves can all be affected, causing discomfort to intense pain. The reduction of these disorders caused through employment is a key objective of the EU through its Community Strategy, proving just how fortunate we are to benefit from\u00a0accessible healthcare.\n\nRead the full story here: \u00a0http://wildernessmedicinemagazine.com/article.asp?id=1026\n\nhttps://mmtrust.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/wilderness-medicine-in-nepal/\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-08 11:32:48", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 13:36:43.473596", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 420, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10002, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2877, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>People in the know</b>\n\nI don't understand what you are trying to accomplish.

La Plus Petite Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que de Belgique se veut \u00eatre un espace reproductible, circulaire et coop\u00e9rative autour du cin\u00e9ma.\n\n\n\nLe but: un cin\u00e9ma clandestin\n \n\nC\u2019\u00e9tait au temps ou Bruxelles Brussellait, c\u2019\u00e9tait au temps du cin\u00e9ma muet (et au temps des cin\u00e9mas de quartier) Depuis lors  on a perdu plus de 250 cin\u00e9ma de quartier. M\u00eame si nous pouvons \u00eatre heureux de notre choix de salles (avec r\u00e9cemment le Palace qui a ouvert ces portes). Le cin\u00e9ma reste une exp\u00e9rience qui dois \u00eatre reproduit dans chaque quartier, \u00e0 chaque \u00e9chelle.\n\nCar le cin\u00e9ma c\u2019est surtout un rituel, celui de prendre le temps de se mettre dans une salle obscure  et se projeter dans un univers. \u00catre seul mais en groupe et partager en simultan\u00e9 une vision d\u2019une ou plusieurs personnes. C\u2019est un moment exceptionnel qui n\u2019est pas imitable dans son salon.\n\nC\u2019est pour \u00e7a que nous lan\u00e7ons cette plus petite cin\u00e9math\u00e8que de Belgique dans le quartier de la petite seine. Derri\u00e8re les projections ce trouvera une analyse du minimum n\u00e9cessaire pour cr\u00e9er un cin\u00e9ma de quartier, et un syst\u00e8me \u00e9conomique pour pouvoir le reproduire dans d\u2019autres espace. Auparavant je me suis d\u00e9j\u00e0 amus\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des cin\u00e9mas de jardin et un cin\u00e9ma mobile. Cette fois si c\u2019est l\u2019exp\u00e9rience cin\u00e9math\u00e8que que j\u2019essaye de cerner\n\nCe cin\u00e9ma \u2018clandestin\u2019 servira de vid\u00e9oth\u00e8que en m\u00eame temps. Quel cin\u00e9phile ne se rappelle pas de la perle qui \u00e9tait l\u2019Excellence, vid\u00e9oth\u00e8que ferm\u00e9 depuis 2010. Le march\u00e9 du DVD en a vue de plus belle, ce que je propose ici est de faire revivre la culture de l\u2019objet, mais dans un cadre collectif.\n\nL'outil : une vid\u00e9oth\u00e8que mise en commun et une \u00e9conomie distribu\u00e9e et circulaire\n \n\nPour cette raison je mets toute ma collection de DVD et Blu-Ray (pr\u00e8t de 1200 titres) en commun, car je me suis rendu compte que ils ne font que ramasser poussi\u00e8re \u00e0 la maison et que le mettre \u00e0 disposition du publique donnerais une vie plus utile \u00e0 l\u2019objet qui est le DVD.\n\n\u200b\n\nL\u2019optimalisation des ressources est un des grands d\u00e9fis pour une \u00e9conomie durable. Donc pourquoi pas l\u2019analyser \u00e0 une plus petite \u00e9chelle en regardant de bons films. Les revenues g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9es par le projet seront remise \u00e0 disposition des utilisateurs  et intervenants du projet. De cette mani\u00e8re une transparence donnera l\u2019occasion de tester le mod\u00e8le fairshare : une partie \u00e9gale au projet (pour investir dans le mat\u00e9riel),  \u00e0 la logistique (pour  l\u2019entretien de la salle et le service) et au utilisateur (qu\u2019ils pourront r\u00e9investir dans la biblioth\u00e8que ou autres partie du projet)\n\nLa m\u00e9thode : une coop\u00e9ration ouverte\n\n\n\u201cavoir par d\u00e9faut une attitude d\u2019ouverture largement accept\u00e9e dans le groupe et une bienveillance envers le partage et la r\u00e9utilisation. C\u2019est ce que j\u2019appelle le paradigme de coop\u00e9ration ouverte\u201d (Ricaud 2013 a).\n\n\u201cengendre un saut conceptuel d\u2019une attitude \"simple\" de Do-It-Yoursel, \u00e0 un \"Be-In-It-Together\" (Morinin, 2015, p. 12)\n\n\u200b\n\nCes deux phrase reprennent fortement la philosophie de gouvernance qui va se mettre en place dans ce projet. Le cadre est fix\u00e9, maintenant il est temps d\u2019ouvrir la boite \u00e0 jeux pour que les gens l\u2019utilisent. C\u2019est de cette mani\u00e8re que nous allons pouvoir cr\u00e9er une ville inclusive en introduisant les codes du open source dans des endroits qui n\u2019en font pas utilisation.\n \n\nLa Plus Petite Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que de Belgique ouvrira ces portes le 7 Juin 2018. La premi\u00e8re s\u00e9ance serra \u2026 et les dix places sont \u00e0 partir de maintenant disponible sur le site.
