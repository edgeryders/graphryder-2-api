On your first point: most tax debtors will be business owners, esp. small business owners \u2013 not employees, as income tax on wages is deducted \"at the source\" and not paid out. So the motivation to pay off the tax debt in-kind is to avoid the impending danger of having ones business closed down.\u00a0 On the second point: yes, granted, that will be a problem. To avoid another incentive problem though, the barter scheme should probably <em>only</em> be applied to the current unenforceable tax debt, as a one-off measure (still 69 000 000 000 EUR though!) \u2026 else everyone would start to hide their money in order to pay their taxes in-kind, which can't keep a state going.\n\nWhat I'm still wondering about is the macro-economic effects of this scheme: Would it maybe boost the national economy, since the government acts as a \"consumer of last resort\"? However, enforcing tax debts is extractive, how could that be responsible for boosting the economy? <img alt=\"frown\" height=\"23\" src=\"/profiles/commons/libraries/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/confused_smile.png\" title=\"frown\" width=\"23\">\n\nHow to present this proposal?

There's some reporting of youth underemployment (part time jobs or temporary work ) that apparently is caused by inability to find full time jobs,.. which I'm not sure is the case for Edgeryders, who sometimes would rather take less paid work and be socially productive.\n\nI made a comment already in this discussion here on the platform, where I posted a summary of the full paper.. what do you think, worth a try to ammend the report?\n\nhttp://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/making-sense-edgeryders-experiences-where-do-we-go-here/mission_case/making-living-reloaded\n\n\u00a0\n\n<br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\">\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-08-14 17:15:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.902765", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 213, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13328, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1407, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Experiences so far</b>\n\nWell I tried some things I could find that are on the international level (because I'm frequently changing places, so involvement on the local level is not sustainable for me):\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Opened an account at the <a href=\"http://www.community-exchange.org/docs/join2.asp?xid=GLOG\">Global Groups Exchange</a> group at <a href=\"http://www.community-exchange.org/\">CES</a>. This is their only time-based international group, so it seemed quite appropriate. Yet it's not busy there: the social critical mass is missing to make it a success. Also they don't have an egalitarian \"all time is worth equal\" principle there, means you can charge more than 60 minutes per hour if you like; I'm not too much of a fan of that idea.</li>\n\n<li>We have a time based compensation system going in the startup company that I'm involved in. Every one of the founders records their working hours, enters it into a web based software, and the system always attributes a share of the company's total gain according to the total work hours. So, all time is valued equally. It's my best experience with practical time banking yet, works really smooth and we never had to talk about or even quarrelled about money in our startup.</li>\n\n<li>Once I had installed <a href=\"http://project.cyclos.org/\">Cyclos</a> on an own server (which is an impressive and free time banking and LETS software by the way). Had planned to use it among friends as a compensation system for time spent in neighborly help, to maintain fairness here. However those friends\u00a0 friends were not too enthusiastic about it, and anyway, just a groups of friends would not provide the necessary group size for the system to take off.</li>\n\n</ul>So as you can see, nothing worked out on the larger scale for me yet. My evaluation is that LETS and time banking really thrive on the local (co-located) level when there is an economic crisis, like in Greece now. On the non-local level they might work in cohesive communities like Edgeryders, or purpose-dedicated communities like online clothing and media bartering sites, but not \"in the open\" or for high-value transactions so far. Mutual trust is an issue etc..\n\nI'd welcome time-banking in Edgeryders, too - personally, I'd fill more into the \"haves\" and \"needs\" sections if I knew that mutual compensation is ensured (rather than providing services in good will in the hope that a compensation opportunity will occur some time). So far, the simplest way to experiment with this would be to <a href=\"http://www.community-exchange.org/misc/joinexchange.htm\">register a new CES exchange</a> specifically for Edgeryders. Integrating directly into the Edgeryders platform would be nice, but requires some custom programming.\n\nAs another part of alternative currencies, I'm involved in <a href=\"http://bitcoin.org/\">Bitcoin</a>. It's neither time banking nor bartering (<a href=\"#comment-1613\">see my comment to Betta below</a>), but it works really well on the international level. For example, I successfully bought something for Bitcoins on <a href=\"http://bitmit.net\">bitmit.net</a>.

Uber is getting sued for not providing their drivers with essential support: health care, insurance, repair\u00a0costs while being free to bring down the prices. And as Google is joining the race, prices will go down. Another problem with Uber is its hunger for monopolizing the markets around - which hopefully will be stopped as well, although this will happen most likely thanks to other giants.\u00a0\n\nAbout Airbnb, you are entitled to rent a spare room where you live - the case is against fake sharing, de facto homes and apartments that were emptied so the owners would make money on short term rentals. This changes the landscape of the city and has huge, negative effects.\u00a0\n\nprobably the difference between scaling and monopolizing markets is one of the criteria here. These startups lost the reasonable idea of scale and infringed territories. Hotels and taxi corporation will protect their share and lobby against these companies, which doesn't need to be good in results. But these battles amplified processes in the urban spaces which could have been happening more quietly before, and that's good. And made people think about sharing and new ways of the economy. Built trust.\u00a0\n\nI think the key here is not to let one giant to emerge, but to allow organic replicas to provide similar offers in their environments, without overarching the whole globe with a great huge fix. If the efforts remain decentralized, scattered, but also adapted to local needs and problems, I can't see a way in which this model would be bad (of course. pharmaceutical companies and other parties interested in ridiculing anything's that out of the system will try to fight it and there will be a need of great success stories that can be told to the people in order to change their attitudes towards alternative approaches to care. Maybe it's not even too late, herbal medicine didn't completely disappear...) or harmful. I believe there should be manuals and ways to ensure people providing help are capable of doing it, however, what kind of manuals and to what extent, I have yet no idea.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-31 14:45:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.176929", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 387, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19025], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23924, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1881, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>unTotem and unConfession Room</b>\n\nSpeaking of\u00a0short ceremonies:\n\nWould the unTotem be of any use?

Short overview of what you are doing. Do you have an organization name?\u00a0\n\n<span>My name is Raman Krishna Maharjan and I am a volunteer of Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) and have been involving for more than 8 years. Soon after earthquake on 2072/01/12, I contacted NRCS Kathmandu District Chapter. After 3</span><sup>rd</sup><span> day of quake, I was deployed to Sankhu, Kathamndu; the most affected region within Kathmandu for search and rescue.</span>\n\nOn 4<sup>th</sup> day, I was deployed to Sindhupalchok; the most affected district for first aid and relief distribution for 2 weeks.\n\nI have my own social service organization named \u201cOnus Nepal\u201d. While I was in Sindhupalchok, Onus Nepal, in 1<sup>st</sup> phage had distributed hygiene package to all the affected families of Kirtipur Municipality, Kathmandu through local disaster management committees.\n\nDuring our hygiene package distribution, we found that children were psychologically more affected. Schools were closed and they had nothing to do other than stay in tents. So, in 2<sup>nd</sup> phage, after my return from Sindhupalchok, we organized child care program. It included drawing, collage, singing, dancing, poem and storytelling and talent shows. We ran this program for 1 week in two different places of Kirtipur.\n\nThere were more than 30 volunteers involved in these programs. Most of them were from affected families. So, in order to support them mentally, we organized \u201cPsychosocial First Aid\u201d workshop for them.\n\nNow, we are focusing on senior citizens. We have observed that they have not recovered from the quake and most of them are still in shock. They get very much afraid even at minor aftershocks that are coming still today. So, we discussed with other stakeholders and came to the conclusion that the best way to support senior citizens is through Adhyatmaa.\n\nSo, we are going to organize a lecture session to support them mentally. And the lecturer is non -other than Doctor Vikashananda.\n\nMoreover, now we are in the phage of reconstruction. Most of the people are involved in demolishing the damaged buildings and building temporary tents. So , we are planning to distribute helmets, gloves and masks to those people.\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. How long did it take for you guys to come together and work on the issue? How many of you are working together?\n\nIn case of NRCS, it took less than 3 hours to come together and respond as soon as possible.\n\nWhile in case of Onus Nepal, it took us 24 hours to come together. We had no concrete plans to work on the issue. No doubt that each one of us eagerly wanted to do something. But we had no budget and plans.\n\nThen, we reached out to friends and well-wishers that were living abroad. Even they were desperate to help but they didn\u2019t have idea how to. With their help, after 10 days, we distributed hygiene packages.\n\nOnus Nepal has 9 board members, 1 advisor and more than 30 volunteers that are being actively involved.\n\n\u00a0\n\n3. How did you choose the theme (cultural heritage, sanitation, temporary shelters, food materials) AND geographical areas that you are working on?\n\nWe thought that earthquake had just gone, but the disaster was still to come. We were concerned with the immediate future after the quake. We were worried about the health condition and epidemic that was most likely to occur. So, to mitigate the upcoming disaster, we choose hygiene and sanitation as our theme for response.\n\nAll of our members and volunteers are from Kirtipur Municipality. Furthermore, we have been working considering Kirtipur Municipality as our working area. Moreover, many villages of Kirtipur Municipality were badly affected. So, we prioritize Kirtipur for disaster response.\n\n\u00a0\n\n4. What have you learned after the relief work? About Nepal? About yourself? About your community?\n\nIt had been a great experience getting out of our comfort zone and working in the relief work.\n\nThe world recognizes Nepal as under-developed country. Some might compare situation here with that of Haiti. Even I thought that it will take months for response by government and reaching the affected people. But it was not so. Yes, it was not quick enough, but it was also not much late for the response by the government.\n\nWhat I learned from my relief work is that any kind of help or support that you can do regardless of your economic and physical condition might be life saving for affected people.\n\nIn mine and most of communities, what I observed is that even though one\u2019s house was damaged, he/she was helping other families for rescue and health treatment. Community members regardless of their religion, caste and economic condition, they were sharing the same tent and same food. Yes there was no any other option, but it didn\u2019t bother them. Each family was concerned with other\u2019s loss.\n\nThe most important thing about Nepal and what others should learn from Nepal Earthquake is that we did not forget to smile even in disaster like this.\n\n5. If you had to repeat the experience of relief work, what would you have done differently?\n\nIf I had to repeat all these, I would definitely focus on the coordination part. While I was in Sindhupalchok, there were more than 20 NGOs/INGOs involved in relief work. But due to poor coordination among them and with local government, relief materials weren\u2019t distributed soon and there were some community that got nothing at all as relief material.\n\n\u00a0\n\n6. How have you coordination with other teams doing similar/different work post Nepal Earthquake?\n\n\u00a0Local government puts the record of all the organization that is working in relief work along with their type of response. Now there is policy that each and every organization has to work with permission from the government. So, we can get the name of organization that are working with the same theme as ours and can jointly organize.\n\nApparently, in our child care program, we coordinated with local organization and jointly organized in one of our two target area.\n\n<span>7. Did you meet army, government, or large NGOs when you were working in the field and how did you coordinate with them? How did you interact with them?</span>\n\nWhile working through NRCS, we definitely met army, government and large NGOs like Shelter Box, WFP, Save the Children, etc. But the coordination part was done by responsible member of NRCS.\n\nAnd through Onus Nepal, we didn\u2019t meet army and other NGOs. In our child care program at Chovar, Kirtipur, we met few members of political party. On our 1<sup>st</sup> day there, they just observed our program. Later, they told us they wanted to support us and they helped us in fooding to children.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-08-27 12:24:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:27.471676", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1240, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24329, "user_id": 105, "topic_id": 2568, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Slidewiki</b>\n\nI would like to give a try to open source <a href=\"http://slidewiki.org\">http://slidewiki.org</a>!\u00a0Folks from Semantic Web faculty in University of Leipzig develop it and they got some interesting workflow for multilingual presentations with revision control implemented there.

And no, I don't think it justifies in any way my rude behavior here ;)\n\nTo stay fair I also can recall happenings which show other, not so much pro-brands tendencies. I feel very proud of <a href=\"/u/ben\">@Ben</a>\u00a0that even while holding quite sensitive role during unMonastery:Matera Pilot Session \\#1, he said <strong>NO</strong>\u00a0to attempts of our dear and beloved fanatics of <a href=\"http://www.matera-basilicata2019.it/en/who-we-are/the-committee.html\">Comitato Matera 2019</a>\u00a0fame to place branding sign of unMonastery and MT2019 on a walls of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/244728780\">Palazzo del Casale</a>, I guess as a part of their mass propaganda campaign\u00a0<em>//#TODO tweet this.url\u00a0@Matera2019\u00a0</em><code class=\"content-output\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/elfpavlik/status/477096551870124032\"><span>\u2713</span></a></code>\n\nWhile on the topics of the ungenious\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.matera-basilicata2019.it/en/mt2019/matera-basilicata/why-matera.html\">Matera bid for European Capital of Culture 2019</a>. I must admit, feeling ashamed (or at least thinking I should), that I didn't take that much time so far to discuss this idea. <strong>I don't doubt in positive intentions of people running MT2019\u00a0Committee</strong>, still I feel free to develop quite critical opinion about their strategy, of course after I take little more time to understand it better. I would very much like to see references to <span>conversations,</span>\u00a0from pre-launch stage of unMonastery:Matera Pilot Session \\#1, where people debate strengths and <strong>weaknesses</strong>\u00a0of their strategy. Also having higher odds of <strong>NOT becoming\u00a0Capital of Culture 2019</strong>, I would find it much more interesting to see plans of revitalizing this town without holing this supposedly prestigious <span>ECOC</span>\u00a0title! Maybe this would become the strongest contribution we can offer to local community if we don't get distracted by\u00a0ECOC <em>rat race</em>? I can recall <a href=\"/u/rossellatarantino\">@rossellatarantino</a>\u00a0mentioning some intention in the past to co-operate with other cities participating in this happening. Sadly only those which she has referred to as <em>Italian</em>, but always something ;)\n\nI plan to leave Matera in 3 weeks and till then have already way too much on my plate, still maybe someone would still like to explore this direction. I've heard about many people in Matera having very negative opinion about MT2019, maybe with some skilled encouragement we can help those people to channel this negativity into some positive creative actions?\n\nAs you may have noticed, If you bothered to read all this mad ramblings, that I don't draw any clear conclusions or go in very precise directions. I see this post, besides just exercising my poor writing skills, as sort of an attempt to throw a wrench in our mental gears and encourage us all to question our mental patterns and pay attention to our habits and tendencies.

But some people do not have access to that. They have to make their own, so that they can reproduce that locus.\n\nThe traditional way to do this was this: you would leave your parents' house, marry,\u00a0settle down with your spouse and have children. This produced a \"one size fits all\" world, with\u00a0most families were very similar to each other in composition. You seem to be saying that now this is untenable, and families should be (and in part are)\u00a0allowed to be more diverse, like a Lego construction made of different-looking pieces. A DIY sort of family, heavily customized.\u00a0Is this broadly correct?\n\nBecause if so, you might be interested in my own quasi-familial thing in Brussels.

Till date, they\u2019ve covered nine districts and reached 44 villages distributing tents and food supplies. We share their story. </em>\n\n\u201cWe do not need to institutionalize to get stuff done. I had worked in development sectors in the past and have been frustrated with the kind of work that we don\u2019t get done. For the first time, I was a part of action oriented group that actually took up responsibilities and left no stones unturned in working efficiently. We are cautious but prepared. As a result, we are a part of an amazing journey.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Nischal Neupane\n\n<strong>The beginning </strong>\n\n\u201cWe were all working independently. I was in Gorkha. Rakesh was in Sankhu. We all worked parallely before. Then we thought, why not work together?\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Sudeep Ghimire\n\nImmediate Earthquake Relief for Rural Nepal is a group of friends (and acquaintances turned friends) who gathered to assist. These motivated individuals are from diverse background but together they have already assisted people with relief materials worth around $23,000.\n\n<strong>Motivation</strong>\n\n\u201cWe were out of the house three days after the earthquake. I think it was pure emotion initially. We could either have stayed quiet or we could have worked. There is an emotional drive after you see people in need. You cannot not do something.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Rakesh Shahi\n\n\u201c What else could we do except help as much as we can.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Nischal Neupane\n\n\u201cI was in Gorkha when we had the first earthquake. I was stressed out and frustrated to say the least. It was difficult to see the politics making rescue work difficult. I wasn\u2019t prepared for that kind of catastrophe. It was unbearable, personally. So I had to do something. I could see villagers making a young child with a broken leg walk for hours for treatment. I knew I had to do something.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Sudeep Ghimire\n\n<strong>Resources and allocation</strong>\n\n\u201cThe first place that we went to was through our personal contact. Abhishek, one of our members, talked about his village that was devastated by the earthquake. So we decided to go to that village in Nuwakot. We thought it would be most feasible to work when we have a local contact. From then on, we started getting calls from local people. They knew we were doing good work so they called and invited us to their villages. We started establishing personal contacts and then started making lists of all that was needed in a particular area. We then looked for resources. We used personal contacts and got materials from all around Nepal.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Sushant Shrestha\n\n\u201cMost of our funds came from friends abroad. After the earthquake, they were forming similar groups there as we were forming here. They started collecting money. But they wanted people they could trust. We have had friends give us money because they knew we\u2019d take it directly to the ground level. They knew we\u2019d use the money well.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Nischal Neupane\n\n<strong>Approaching a geographical area</strong>\n\n\u201cWe talked to the locals directly and went to a geographical area. In Chautara, we tried to go for assessment before we went with relief aid. But this meant losing time and resources. So what we did was we started cross checking with the Army, government organizations and other organizations. We coordinated to ensure that the place needed what the locals claimed it did. It is natural for local people to assume their villages is in need but it fell upon us to make sure there weren\u2019t other places that needed it more.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Nischal Neupane\n\n\u201cWe tried our best to reach the most desperate places in Nepal. We knew Bhaktapur was being looked after by many groups and organizations. So we mainly focused outside valley. We tried to reach backward community who needed us the most.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Rakesh Shahi\n\n<strong>Co-ordination</strong>\n\n\u201cWe coordinated with the local people obviously. Besides that, we had assistance from army personnel and members from Police. In Thulo Dhading, one of the places that had not received relief aid almost two weeks after the earthquake, we needed security to take the materials so we wouldn\u2019t be attacked by desperate earthquake survivors. We had our own security in question. But besides some places, where political parties hindered our approach, most places had good coordination. At times, we worked with other groups that were providing relief, exchanging materials and information. We mostly coordinated to make resources available to each other. We provided tents to groups that needed it for their rescue work.\u201d \u2013 Sushant Shrestha\n\n<strong>Learning opportunities: About the country</strong> \u2026\n\n\u201cI had mixed emotions when I entered Thulo Dhading. I was happy that the people were overwhelmed to receive what little we could give them. But exasperated that the little could make them so happy, that they were so desperate. I remember getting extremely emotional.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Nischal Neupane\n\n\u201cI still have the images of broken homes and buildings. I remember the roads in places like Chautara and Nagarkot with buildings falling apart on either side of the road.\u201d \u2013 Rakesh Shahi\n\n\u201cI realized that there is no government presence anywhere we went. People need to be aware themselves and they need to prepare for the worst. People have to rely on each other in a community and not on the government that is not there.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Sushant Shrestha\n\n\u201cIt is amazing to see how resilient people are. There were places where people were desperate but in most areas, people were ready to bounce back. It is so good to see Nepali people retaining their sense of humor despite the catastrophe. They still have their agricultural fields. They have source of income. Now all they need is to build a house in village and they are ready. Government on the other hand was not prepared for this to happen. The District Development Committee and Village Development Committee in Nepal are exclusively used for paperwork. They do not know about disaster response\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Nischal Neupane\n\n\u201cI think remittance helped a lot in villages. The migrant workers abroad can still send money and they have a good chance of getting back to normal lives because of the money they get from abroad.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Sushant Shrestha\n\n<strong>\u2026 and about yourself</strong>\n\n\u201cI realized that I was not indifferent towards things. Also, I was extremely action-oriented. I always concentrate on the future. What do we do next? I believe in taking the next step and concentrating in the future. As a team I think, it was good to see people take charge of their activities. Everyone picked up what they were best at and started working.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Nischal Neupane\n\n\u201cI think we went from one moment of rescue to the other. It was extremely action oriented. It was really good to come together and work.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Rakesh Shahi\n\n\u201cI realized what life is afterall. Death probably is the most important thing and everything is an illusion. All we did was work to reach people in need. We did not even have time to feel satisfied with our work. Somehow feeling satisfied felt selfish.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Sushant Shrestha\n\n<strong>Suggestions for the future</strong>\n\n\u201cWe relied on local information too much. Sometimes locals can be misleading as well. Our experience in Dhading taught us this lesson. It is not wrong of them to want to secure for future. These are uncertain times. But we need to be more careful to provide the resources to those in dire need.\u201d \u2013 Nischal Neupane\n\n\u201cPassion is important. But passion also brings fear. I think we need to work as neutrally as possible. For the first time in my life, I understood the meaning of action-oriented instead of result-oriented work. We did not know how to cope with this catastrophe but we evolved and we reached out to people.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Sushant Shrestha\n\n\u201cOur activities keep on increasing. We started with materials but naturally moved on to talking about sanitation. We took responsibilities as they came to us.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Nischal Neupane\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-26 03:23:06", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 14:28:43.457180", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1487, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2560, 5, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5544, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5511, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/29c39f36ae21a46bf9b595066441b2ed56ec0f69.jpg\" width=\"638\" height=\"479\">\n\nNotes from\u00a0community call 11/4 with @Moushira, @Alberto_Simonetti, @zoescope, @LuceChiodelliUB, @Patrick_Andrews, @Noemi\n\nThe main topic we discussed was about the Open Care engagement activities under way, and the need to\u00a0make sure our work feeds into the online conversation (mainly Noemi\u2019s concerns that if engagement outcomes\u00a0are not online, the research will not be there and we're missing the opportunity to learn from each other)\n\nAlberto:\n\nMilano team: first cycle of the engagement in the project is almost over; they are collecting stories from these communities where workshops were held- migrants, elderly etc.\n\nThe process in Milano is: the team organises events for specific audience groups and presents the project; then they take people in private and see which people are eager to tell their stories; ask them to send them once they are written.\n\nIn the 1st meeting with early dancers - they rounded people up and asked them to talk to us in very informal ways; now\u00a0thinking about meeting them with videomakers to capture stories easily.

Where can they find simple straightforward information about it?\u00a0 The landing page could be overwhelming</li>\n\n<li>Security (what if the story involves violence, running away from something..etc)</li>\n\n<li>Privacy (what if the person doesn't want to share in public!), we don't have options for sharing anonymously</li>\n\n<li>Storytelling is a gift, not everyone with a story knows how to tell it</li>\n\n<li>The only way to share is to write it down. Uploading podcasts is a multiprocess</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\u00a0\n\nSome ways to go about discomfort when\u00a0sharing\u00a0stories: an environment that is conducive to sharing stories publicly is theatre; makes people think that they are putting themselves at distance (e.g. abuse for women).\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnother option is role playing in front of a small audience - then people want to be part of the performance (Zoe)\n\nZoe:\n\nIt\u2019s important to see if they have experience or if they are able to connect with what we are doing. Many people who are already in the care community are not digitally advanced -are not using English, or sharing platforms online. The fact that Op3n Care is online is not helping. Facebook is very common in Italy, but mostly for youth.\u00a0It\u2019s important to offer another platform/medium for people to share their story because they need to be and feel close; and because they find online challenging\n\nWhen we do workshops we have teenagers very used to make videos, share pics, hashtags etc. with the care community it\u2019s a different mindset; make them shift\n\n<strong>What\u00a0resources are available to better facilitate story collection?\u00a0</strong>\n\n\u00a0Zoe -\u00a0we don\u2019t have budget from our WeMake activities to put into facilitating the stories. We don\u2019t have time to take a story and put it online\n\nMoushira mentioned some other blocks that we need to be aware of:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>make it clear that people can write in English</li>\n\n<li>make it clear that there is a possibility to write anonymously online;</li>\n\n<li>privacy is very important!</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nZoe:\n\nIt\u2019s part of the research to understand which part of the community we\u2019re talking about. Figuring out contexts in which communities share is\u00a0an outcome in itself - maybe this level of sharing is too open. A take away point is that we need to be giving people the means, the tools, the concept of why this sharing is important\n\nNoemi, Zoe, Alberto:\n\nOur\u00a0research is twofold - online and physical workshops, important components for the project; the offline components are complementary to online;\u00a0however, the online is also a means to go deeper into a story because those participating and engaging with the protagonist are contributing new knowledge! Don\u2019t forget that for the people we engage the value is not talking to us, but talking to each other\n\nLuce closed the call letting us know about developments in Bordeaux:\n\nThey are about to make two big announcements about OpenCare: for Computer Science Lab and at Uni level to get more researchers onboard for prototyping; e.g. 2 researchers working with lasers to produce human tissue - Luce will see if there are ways for him to get involved, as\u00a0a lot of people in the lab working with interesting stuff and it would be a pity not to use it. Will connect these with WeMake.\n\nCan you help? We're looking for\u00a0creative ideas to speed up the sharing and make it more lively and insightful for everyone joining Op3n Care.

That is an important part, and one reason why we need access to data.\n\n[2] Not necessarily easier in general. Rather, more likely that the <em>right</em> (groups of) people find each other. Coordination over long distance - yes (but physical distance is the least problematic in this respect).\n\n[3] I am not sure I have enough detail to decide on that. I checked the publishers site but it seems to be intended as eye-candy. There seem to be some inconsistencies with regard to the USA as well.\n\nRegarding Ondi: Interestingly I did not have her on the radar before, and I was initially tempted to bash her video thoroughly as an example of misguiding entrepreneurial cheer-leading. However given the documentaries she has done I wonder if this is some sort of insider joke one would get if one had watched them attentively. On the surface it looks like an ad for a slightly modernized version of a best-of album.\n\nWhat is of critical importance though is that she comes from the human -small scale- end of things, while most of the deciders are high level economics/finance/policy wonks. Of course both aspects are necessary. But I think the main features of a good policy are: a) It does not get in the way. b) It represents the interests of the citizens (not just 0.1%), and the indirectly affected persons (including future generations). I could go on talking about Ondi - an perhaps I should at some point, but I'll leave it at this for now.\n\nI've just run into the release of this report: http://citie.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CITIE_Report_20151.pdf\n\nYou may want to go to page 55 directly and see who is behind it (I assume Accenture did the heavy lifting on the financial side). <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Nanterme\">#1</a>: http://www.transatlanticbusiness.org/tabd/ (also: http://www.citizen.org/trade/harmonization/TABD/index.cfm). But I'd say the others look like a decent bunch overall. Especially Nesta seems to have some good people. So overall it probably serves as a decent average OMG-WTF-we-need-to-innovate-document.\n\nIf you go to page 53 and read the summary a little, I am tempted to say I rest my case. This is the absolute top-down approach. Of course some of it just specifies things I cover in a) &amp; b) above. However they add other details based on assuming they already know the right answer, which tends to look an awful lot like silicon valley + correlation/causation mix-ups.\n\nIn a nutshell their \"ecosystem thingy\" is trying to farm by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_modification\">weather modification</a> based on plants in a far away land with different weather pattern and ecosystem dynamics. And if it kills all the bees of an apple orchard in the process, who cares - the (high yield) corn is what we're after! And if the KPI-yield is still too low by Q2 - we can always rent more office space, add fertilizer, and fudge the data.\n\nWhat you should be doing is watching the locals do their version of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters_%28agriculture%29\">three sisters</a> <em>from seed</em>, and taking a lot of notes, up close. Uncomfortably close. You'll probably learn most from the things that <em>don't work</em>, let's call them KFIs. And you will not be done in less than a season - that much is for sure. If you don't make many the identified mistakes there's a good chance you'll increase your yield. Then you can effectively hypothesize about cause and effect, and test if pulling on blades of grass will make them grow faster or taste sweeter. Or if you should introduce a new species or breed with an existing stock.\n\nOf course you can go crazy do Big Data driven agile 5 year sprints/big leaps - and there's high chances that <em>some</em> good will come out of them, but I doubt it will be worth inflicting this on (any of) the 40 seemingly most import cities. A great forest needs a couple of years to grow, burning it down on the other hand, is a lot faster.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-25 21:36:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:21.178442", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 828, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25384], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4438, "user_id": 2588, "topic_id": 4405, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**_Available in: [Romanian](#ro)_**\n\n------\n\n## _Romanian version_ <a name=\"ro\"></a>\n\n_Bucharest needs to organise its enthusiastic people better, because a lot of the time the energy dissipates only because you don't have someone to support you with a kind word, with an idea; not everyone has a large group of friends ready to do anything for a project just because it's interesting and possibly, with no financial rewards. And this is how another unicorn dies._\n\nEste o placere sa scriu aici! De ceva timp tot vedem \"your vibe call your tribe\" si uite ca este adevarat. Job ul de community connector and engager este foarte fain si provocator. Din ce am citit din prezentare munca din urmatoarele doua luni va fi de cercetare, organizare de informatii si a unei intalniri si mai ales de intelegere a comunitatii Edgeryders. Partea de cercetare, documentare, a vietii culturale bucurestene o fac de ceva timp pentru grupul de fb pe care il moderez, pentru ca evenimentele de nisa si faine se pierd in marea de evenimente, grup unde va astept si pe voi sa ne spuneti ce se mai intampla in Bucuresti, https://www.facebook.com/groups/bucurestiulmonden/ . Acest grup l am crescut in ultimii ani si sunt mandru ca nu avem spam si creste incet, oamenii vin singuri, nu sunt bagati cu forta in grup si se implica si ei in a posta evenimente. Urmeaza sa treaca si in online, cat de curand vom lansa si site ul, dar mai este de munca la el. Cautarea de evenimente si oameni este faina, de fiecare data mai descoperi o bucatica de lume si asta am experimentat ajutand la organizarea TEDxBucharest si in anii de voluntariat in proiectul incubator107. De fiecare data am avut ocazia sa vad o lume care la inceput, prin 2010, imi parea greu de descoperit, iar azi trebuie doar sa vrei sa o descoperi. Este fain sa vezi ca oamenii se aduna sa faca ceva, in primul rand pentru ca cred in acel ceva, in al doilea rand pentru ca se vor simti bine facand asta si undeva, acolo, pentru bani. Bucurestiul are nevoie sa isi organizeze entuziasti mai bine, pentru ca de multe ori energia se pierde doar pentru ca uneori nu ai pe cineva langa tine sa te sustina cu o vorba, cu o idee, pentru ca nu toata lumea are un grup de prieteni care sunt gata sa faca un proiect pentru ca este interesant si posibil, fara un castig financiar. Si asa mai moare cate un unicorn. Sunt sigur ca vom avea de invatat cate ceva unii de la altii si abia o astept sa o fac, sper sa ne vedem cat de curand si oricine va fi ales sa fie community connector and engager sa stie sa colaboreze si mai ales sa poata cere ajutor cand va avea nevoie, ca de aia este vorba de comunitate. Abia astept sa ne vedem si ma bucur ca v am descoperit! Bine ai venit in Bucuresti @Noemi ! P.S. aici veti gasi evenimentele din acest week end (Noaptea Muzeelor si Design Week sunt doar punctate)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/bucuresteanulmonden/posts/105958613071369", "created_at": "2015-05-15 15:25:57", "updated_at": "2018-04-14 14:33:24.116548", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 527, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 21.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2580, 2738], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15655, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 3148, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Welcome!</b>\n\nGreat to have you on board Leo, looking forward working with you!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-13 10:31:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:28.009066", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17834, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 2852, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>sure!</b>\n\nsure, we'll push these news too :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-26 14:18:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:39.529043", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16157], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31213, "user_id": 1543, "topic_id": 1800, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>A few questions</b>\n\nWhile finiding out how/when will I be able to join LOTE3, I would ask a couple of question:\n\n1.

Would that clash with Edgeryders' philosophy?\n\n[TheCP] mentioned finalcut pro, so I'm probably not alone on the \"dark side of the software\"; what's Edgeryders' position in this regard? Is open-source a must, or just a preferred solution? Is there something like an Edgeryders' core production which is to be entirely made with open source software (as opposed to a wider collection of \"do-as-you-wish\" media)?\n\n2. If I'll be able to join LOTE3, I have quite a variety of toys which I might bring with me (DSLR camera, directional mic, Zoom recorder, Igus slider, shoulder-rig, flycam, ...).

By households, restaurants, markets and especially supermarkets, by you, by your family, by your neighbor, by me. We collected food close to being dumped and got people to cook together and share a meal while interacting heavily around the issue.\n\nI won\u2019t ramble about why it\u2019s important we pay more attention to food overall - from where and how far it comes from, the cost of having nicely chopped avocados on a restaurant plate, to how we pick stuff off the supermarket shelves and never wonder where the brown bananas are going, to how we realize our canned peas are overdue after having been hidden in overstuffed fridges or pantries (it\u2019s a <a href=\"https://green.harvard.edu/tools-resources/video/expired-food-waste-america\">trap</a>!). You know this already, right?\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/foodwastecombat/\">Food Waste Combat in Cluj </a>(FWC) is a local collective experimenting with creative ways to address the issue, and I joined them for many selfish reasons, but mostly because I\u2019d like to see food activism reach educated, resourceful urbanites. I\u2019m one of them and I think as a group we can do better. We\u2019re well positioned to use a tiny bit of our time doing something other than work, other than expensive hobbies, other than just consuming.

It doesnt mean that these all work or that I know which works best, but altogether they make for consistent communication for engagement. Even if you are doing physical events, there needs to be interesting OpenCare content to come in handy once people at events look you up. Even if they are not digitally savvy, they might still be willing to interact with a good story if that's one click away.\n\nLet me know if this helps, and if we should have a call just to dig deeper. @Moushira are you still into this? Want to do some work together, and turn this into a plan that we can all use? \n\nNB 1. It involves picking the most interesting things in the project for them. Don't assume the project per se being interesting is enough for people to find their way in.\n\n2. It involves writing.\n\n<strong>1. Personally invite and welcome new people in the online community.</strong> This can be a way to follow up online events and email people who were in the room and showed interest.\n\n<em>Example: \"I thought a good way for you to get a sense of what people are talking about lately is to point you to some interesting threads. Go ahead and leave a comment with your experience or a piece of advice. This way you'll dive right into the community and be notified when opportunities come up. Here they are, take your pick :-)\n\n</em>\n\n<em>\n\na) When it comes to accepting newcomers in society, how do we transform fear into trust? \u201cI once helped supplying refugees with clothes. Our group of volunteers carried box after box and it would happen that some of the refugees ask to help us. We would refuse their offers and told them that it's okay to go rest and let us do the work. I didn't realise at that time that we treated them like children, belittling them, taking their integrity and giving them the feeling of uselessness. Out of arrogant goodwill.\" Dennis: https://edgeryders.eu/en/a-new-chapter-in-other-peoples-story-books</em>\n\n<em>\n\nb) When life is not about ticking off to-do lists and becoming \"successful\", how do we cope? \"I think sharing our vulnerabilities and insecurities around failing, missing out and not wanting anymore is crucial at this point. Although there are already some great projects bringing these issues into awareness it seems that for a majority of people the stigma around for example mental illness, burnout etc. is still too big to cope with on their own.\" Offer Nele a piece of advice? https://edgeryders.eu/en/on-being-a-self-entrepreneur</em>\n\n<strong> 2. Share on social media consistently. We all have communities following our organisations/ individual accounts.</strong>\n\nAn easy way is to share the <a href=\"/t/comms-sign-up-to-receive-opencare-headlines-directly-on-email-and-share-them-in-sync-with-the-team/5567\"> CountOnMe headlines</a> and ping people on social media who could be interested in one of the pieces. A story is always more engaging than linking to an organisation page, an event page, or broadcasting news.\n\n<strong>3. Blog about OpenCare or related topics. NB Especially in your own languages!</strong>\n\nOver time we keep finding new angles to OpenCare, or new ways of framing the project, without sticking to the jargon in the  initial proposal. This is about experimenting with new language, package it with existing project materials or work in our own organisation, and about trying new channels. An example is posts <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/did-you-know-we-can-understand-health-social-care-network-el-imam\">on LinkedIn</a>, but there is also Medium, there are personal websites some of us have, even Facebook notes and so on.\n\n<strong>4. Publish calls for participation with immediate, concrete rewards for contributors</strong>\n\nThese are the meaty opportunities and it's also why OpenCare Fellowships were designed. People are more likely to engage if there is something that answers these questions: <em>What makes it so special? Why should I get involved NOW not later? What are key ways for me to get involved?</em> An example of call for participation: <a href=\"/t/call-for-participation-submit-a-story-of-care-to-become-one-of-the-first-op3ncare-research-fellows/5580\">Submit a story of care to become one of the first OpenCare Research Fellows</a>\n\nIdeally all posts should answer all questions, but we're learning..\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-30 11:35:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:58.260700", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 836, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3069], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14623, "user_id": 1012, "topic_id": 3006, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>I dont know enough probably</b>\n\nHi Nadia!\n\nProbably I don\u2019t know enough about Edgeryders strategic foresight.<span> From a newcomer point of view, probably market would't seem to be its main \u00abinterface\u00bb for encouraging changes.

Bien que le Dr Deepak Chopra ait inclus l'\u00e9coute comme la premi\u00e8re chose \u00e0 faire, dans son livre '<a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/The-Soul-Leadership-Unlocking-Potential/dp/030740806X\">The Soul of Leadership, unlocking your potential for greatness</a>', publi\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2010, l'\u00e9coute n'est pas encore per\u00e7ue comme <em>l'incarnation du sacr\u00e9</em>.\n\nCe que je n'arrive pas encore \u00e0 visualiser, dans ma t\u00eate, c'est comment nous allons pouvoir composer avec les gens qui sont actuellement dans des postes de gestion et de direction, et les faire passer de l'Ombre \u00e0 un \u00e9tat plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, qui favosiserait l'\u00e9coute et de nombreuses autres dispositions, plus altruistes. Je vois des citoyens se morfondre pour faire des projets \u00e0 la place des gestionnaires (les hackers cr\u00e9ent des bases de donn\u00e9es, d'autres con\u00e7oivent des plate-formes collaboratives, etc.), mais aucun d'entre nous, m\u00eame en le souhaitant de toute notre volont\u00e9, ne peut penser \u00e0 la place des gestionnaires. Cela doit venir d'eux. Je disais derni\u00e8rement \u00e0 un de mes coll\u00e8gues de D\u00e9mocratie ouverte, chacun respire par soi-m\u00eame...\n\nIl s'agit d'une probl\u00e9matique qui me tourne dans la t\u00eate depuis plusieurs mois. Comment faire pour que le basculement des esprits ait lieu? C'est un peu trop compliqu\u00e9 pour mes pauvres neuronnes ordinaires... Cela me d\u00e9passe largement. Jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, j'ai song\u00e9 au remplacement des individus qui sont verrouill\u00e9s dans leurs perceptions, \u00e0 l'introduction, dans des \u00e9quipes ou des communaut\u00e9s, d'individus portant des valeurs diff\u00e9rentes pour cr\u00e9er une diversification qui graduellement permettra de casser le mod\u00e8le monolothique de l'Ombre, et \u00e0 continuer de d\u00e9fendre les valeurs <em>du sacr\u00e9</em>, en pointant des exemples, en en parlant et en les maintenant \u00e0 l'ordre du jour des discussions. \u00c0 moyen terme, si une importante proportion de la population porte ces valeurs dans leurs esprits, cela donnera lieu \u00e0 d'heureuses initiatives.\n\nL'id\u00e9al, ce serait qu'il surviennent un \u00e9v\u00e9nement magistral, qui illumine d'un coup les esprits, et fasse ainsi basculer une importante proportion de la population vers de nouvelles fa\u00e7ons de vivre. Cela aurait pour effet d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer la transition. La <a href=\"http://www.lespacearcenciel.com/interview-du-dr-dieter-broers-biophysicien-a-propos-de-2012.html\">th\u00e9orie de Dieter Broers</a> est vraiment tr\u00e8s tentante... Elle faciliterait tellement les choses. Imagine la foudre qui terrasserait, tel pour Saint-Paul \u00e0 Damas, ceux dont l'esprit est enferm\u00e9 dans l'Ombre!\u00a0\n\nUne autre th\u00e9orie, beaucoup plus concr\u00e8te, qui rel\u00e8ve un peu du tordage de bras et de la main de fer, est la th\u00e9orie de <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/hilary-clinton-urges-governments-to-be-open-and-transparent/2012/04/17/gIQAjCQTOT_story.html\">Hillary Clinton</a>, qui s'appuie en fait sur la peur. Je n'aime pas tellement cela, mais c'est malheureusement ce qui fait courir le monde depuis que le monde est monde. Dire aux gestionnaires que s'ils n'adoptent pas la philosophie du gouvernement ouvert (avec plus de collaboration, donc n\u00e9cessairement plus d'\u00e9coute), ils risquent de faire face au chaos social, les pousse \u00e0 agir non pas parce que ces id\u00e9es les attirent sinc\u00e8rement, mais pour \u00e9viter le pire.\n\n\u201d<em>Those governments that hide from public view and dismiss people\u2019s aspirations for greater freedom and openness will find it increasingly difficult to prosper, to maintain peace and security</em>,\u201d declared Hillary Clinton.\n\n'Dismiss people's aspirations' signifie en d'autres mots manquer d'\u00e9coute...\n\nL'id\u00e9al serait que chacun ouvre son esprit par soi-m\u00eame. Je suis port\u00e9e \u00e0 penser que certains n'y parviendront jamais. Un bon coup d'\u00e9clair sur la t\u00eate... ne ferait pas de tord \u00e0 plusieurs...!!! J'aimerais vraiment que la th\u00e9orie de Broers se mat\u00e9rialise, en plus, c'est pr\u00e9vu pour 2012. Raison de plus d'esp\u00e9rer qu'un facteur acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur surgisse prochainement.

Looks easier in retrospect!\n\nIntergenerational networks, &amp; medication ...\n\n---\n\nI heard long ago about some scheme in Japan where students at one university would shop for groceries for the elderly, in (networked) exchange for others doing the same for their parents (at their home town).\n\nMaybe the same could be done for healthy life: taking each other for a walk and cooking healthy food. (I'm not sure who would take who out for a walk, in certain cases I know of. ;-))\n\nThere was this story in Cuba (could have been anywhere else) where kids would be taken to vaccination by the elderly, missing school that morning, while parents would go to work.\n\nSeveral issues come to mind:\n\n- These things need to be facilitated. They happen spontaneously, but facilitation can go a long way in making them more frequent, easier, maybe even more fun, and correlated to other needs. (Students in Japan without parents to be taken care of would have their \"currency\" converted to say books.)\n\n- There are priorities, and some kind of \"population view\" might be useful, so that important things are taken care of first or at least most. Just as an example, we don't want vital diseases in the young to fall through the gaps.\n\n- We still need to take care of those who are not taken care of by the social network around them. So there would be need for some kind of, what's the name, broom lorry?, you know, the car that picks up cyclists who are too tired to go on with the bike race.\n\n- Instant communities would work across generations. The idea would be to make a rough local census of haves and needs. A building with 10 families, 40 people in all, might have different ages and situations. If one of the more abled elders mantains a list of diseases and medications, she or he can be contacted by the young ones and distribute the jobs. Or maybe they can just have a party from time to time!\n\n---\n\nNow, medication, shortage and cooperation-vs-competition ...\n\nIf there's a shortage, the general fear is the powerful ones (or their close ones in need) will get the first and best. So the dis-networked elderly will more easily be left without.\n\nFor some medications, some elderly people are even willing to do without if that benefits their young. When asked about a vaccine for a formidable killer like the avian flu virus (if it caused a pandemic with a high mortality), many grandparents would prioritise their own grandchildren. (Not sure if they would prioritise other people's grandchildren.)\n\nThose decisions are always difficult, messy, and - erm - not always sanitised by sunlight. So, no easy way out. Having enough for everyone, good shared open criteria for what level of disease needs what level of treatment, alternatives so that pain is always treated, etc - harder than it looks.\n\nCan a shortage reduce cooperation? Sure, at least among layers. Within layers there could be more cooperation. A tough one and I don't have shiny advice for that at all. :-/ (Slow thinking ...)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-25 15:57:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.223591", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 564, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19241, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1946, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>Looking forward</b>\n\nOk, so no debate for now. I look forward to \\#LOTE3 for that. But wait, maybe I could still debate with other people on this thread! Meanwhile, just a quick comment to offer apologies for any unintended hurt I might have caused to you, [iamronen] or others. I do have a very confrontational debating style (I say \"I disagree with that\" a lot). I am convinced it saves everybody time. On the upside, I never take personal offence at disagreement, so you are welcome to go for the throat. I am a Popperian: the way we make progress is by proving each other wrong, whereas saying \"you are right\" might be nice but is a fundamentally unprovable statement. So, when someone tries to prove <em>me </em>wrong I take it as a gift, not as an attack.\n\nAlso, let me add I like design just as much as the next guy. I hang out with designers regularly; I taught a course in design; one of my projects made it into a <a href=\"http://www.triennaledesignmuseum.it/designoftheotherthings.php\">high-profile design exhibition</a> in Milano; the same was even nominated for a prestigious design award, <a href=\"http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premio_Compasso_d%27oro#XXII_edizione_-_2011\">Compasso d'oro</a>, in 2011 (it did not win). Designing is something humans do, and you would be hard put to find anyone who can help herself engaging in design activities. I like much less at ease with the idea that there is a special category of people that does the designing for the rest of us. I have come to think that people who think of themselves as the professionals who do design work are responsible for the fact that the artifact part of online communities (the software) get a disproportionate amount of attention with respect to their agent part (the people and their ways). But enough of that! You said no debating, and, having apologized and lauded design, I will now stop. :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-15 15:56:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.278696", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 341, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19151], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32531, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 4918, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>The right perspective</b>\n\nThe recommendations we have must be looked at from the right perspective.

I personally believe digital media not to be so good at solving the discussion we are entering. Why not put that at the agenda in June and make it an item to be discussed by the steering committe meeting. If June is too far away, let's make it a closed, official, mandatory meeting\u00a0with\u00a0steering committee members.]\n\nI encourage everyone to appreciate the efforts made to come up with these recommendations. That being said, Alberto is absolutely right: part of it is\u00a0a political compromise. I personally would use the term \"institutional\".\n\nIDENTITY. On the identity side, the recommendations are right: for now, the use of different spelling is confusing. I agree with Zoe with the fact that the \"3\" is geek habit and can hinder our will to engage with \"ordinary\" people. The use by others of similar names, in similar context, has to be taken into account. This must be clarified and I am confident we will find a viable solution.\n\nNOT ONE, BUT TWO COHABITING PROJECTS. The situation also partly holds to the fact that there are two projects running in parallel and mixing together. The institutional, funded, partly academic\u00a0one\u00a0partners engaged into; and the one promised to live long after the EU initiative and run by EdgeRyders -- I admit it took me some time to realize this. And in fact, the EU initiative was triggered by EdgeRyders' fantastic capability to have people and\u00a0ideas come together and great project emerge.\n\nLANDING PAGE.\u00a0I am ready to comply with the experts and designers advice on the use/design of single/multiple\u00a0landing page(s), etc. I guess one main issue is that the EU project and partners of this EU initiative are simply\u00a0non visible on the actual websites (the pages hosted on the edgeryders porta). And this is a problem that must not be too easily discarded/ignored. I hear this sounds dramatically narcissic, but hey, academia lives on recognition and visibility\u00a0-- that's what fuels the funds we will be able to get the next time we run a tender. That's what fuels the whole of academia, from the baseline researchers to the top institutionals in the organizational chart.\u00a0I believe it might\u00a0just be the same with non-academic partners that nevertheless mostly live on public funds.\n\nA distinct landing page looked like a good compromise to satisfy all these (narcissic)\u00a0expectations. This distinct landing page is not\u00a0about moving or having people meet, it has other \"intitutional\" aims, that are not addressed by the actual setting.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA. What I hear from Alberto is that trafic anyway takes place on EdgeRyders accounts. That bringing trafic to these other \"opencare\" accounts is a lot of work -- I hear he asks whether we (and who?) are ready to put the efforts to keep these accounts alive. So the question is (asked to the steering committee?): do we want/need these \"institutional\" channels, and if so are we ready to invest the necessary resources?\n\nA question is asked about the relevancy of having a G+ channel (devoted to videos, from what I understood). Again, to be accepted,\u00a0the answer must take the dual nature of opencare into account.\n\nOk, that comment is far too long already. I hope its content makes sense.\n\nI'm looking forward to read all your constructive propositions.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-04 12:58:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:58.673383", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 644, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14898, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 1771, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>You woke up the bee in me :)</b>\n\nOn with the brainstorming on local barter community development in Matera...\n\n1. Starting from existing commnuities. Good point. This brings us to the second step: picking the existing community eager to experiment the Economy App. Not as simple as it seems, in the sense that commnuities are not clearly defined entities (the unemployed, the coworkers, the creative scene). I would bypass this question, keeping in mind that we are looking for people with a strong interest in bartering, ready to play the game: if this groups of people is also united around other common interests (agro markets, ecc.) it is better.\n\n2. Integrating with a makerspace. \"This should be a nice hangout place for the young unemployed\". True. But I have my doubts on the actual feasability of this in a short time: the hacker culture is not exactly flooding the souls of Southern Italy, which still has pockets of conservateurism and resistance to change. Also, I wouldn't underestimate the effect of the initial scepticism, augmented because invitation to change comes from outsiders. Last but not least, I had understood that unemployed youngsters (let's keep in mind that in Italy we are young until 45 :-) were the target: I am not sure that Casa Netural's community is made of unemployed people facing the impacts of the financial and economic crisis in the region.\n\nThis is a crucial question, and an important thing to understand: as all cities, Matera is stratified both spacially and socially. However, I find the ceisure quite abrupt as the people operating in the cultural and creative realm are located in the historical center and the Sassi, and do not seem to be communicating with the rest of the city : the neighbourhoods from the '50s and the ones developed in the '90s. These different souls are all representative of Matera, but I feel that if we want to go for real social innovation, we have to make radical choices and face the people in the neighbourhoods located in the outskirts of Matera (outskirts is meant also metaphorically).Go where bartering is necessary, although unknown and unimaginable.\n\n3 &amp; 4. Parties. Yes, especially with food :) But I am not sure that this is the core question right now :)\n\n5. What I find interesting here is the physical presence and the idea of having one in the Sassi and one in another neighbourhood. I suppose one could link the different spaces by assembling different communties, such as unMonastarians - Arduino Matera - group of unemployed. My doubts here are on the time-consuming activities of building the chain, setting up the places, spreading the word. Not impossible, but it takes time.\n\n6, 7 &amp; 8: starting points that convince me the most, although I was wondering on how much they could be assembled: what I mean is, if you go for the option 8, would it make sense to organize bi-weekly meetings?\n\nSo I've been going with this in my head since your first posts, and now even more since you posted this. Step two is I emptied my head and started to think in <em>materano </em>(as much as I can, as I am an outsider too :). I won't explain the whole process I went through, but I will go straight to the proposal on a possible way to start seeding the local barter community (in the already existing).\n\nThe premice is that I was thinking on getting to the unemployed. More on that when we meet at LOTE: you have to visualize what I am speaking about!\n\n<strong>How to spread the word? </strong>3 channels come to my mind:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>publish short announcement on local newspaper, on the page for \"job opportunities\"</li>\n\n<li>contact the local <a href=\"http://www.lavoro.basilicata.it/prt_doveSiamo.asp\">Centro per l'Impiego</a> (public support to unemployed): I wouldn't put high hopes on this, but it's always good to explore the official route</li>\n\n<li>12 minutes on the local regional TV (<a href=\"http://www.trmtv.it/home/\">TRM</a>): fundamental as it covers all the region and gets to a very diversified audience. On TRM I have a direct link.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThis means that one should have promotion material in Italian: the best thing would be infographics as this would explain in a simple and visual way concepts that might sound a bit extravagant to people that have never ever heard of complementary currency and so on.\n\nBasically, I would go for a very simple \"month of barter\" for 20 unemployed. If this is done in a certain way, I think it is going to attract quite a lot of attention as we are not speaking mt2019, culture, events, social innovation... but proposing a well defined project. How I see it, a lot of work will have to be done before the launch (finding a simple and reassuring way to explain a complex and seemingly distant notion as \"digital bartering\"), but once it is launched, during the month, one has to follow and observe (right?).\n\nAnother option is the Centro per l'Impiego: they probably have a database with all the people looking for jobs. This could be a good base to start community mapping. However I find it important that interest people contact the local community developers than vice versa.\n\nNow, the questions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>how much do you want to be linked to the local municipality + matera2019? This is a tricky question. How I see it, on one hand it can give visibility, on the other it can exclude you from a big piece of interest groups.</li>\n\n<li>is it realistic to imagine that for LOTE3 we have the basic material in italian (video? animation? infographics? short article)? If so, one could consider organizing a track on this specifically? And/or start exploring the different options to spread the word.</li>\n\n<li>the more I think about this, the more it interests me: some of the questions overlap with the ones I have been asking myself for the matchmaking, however this contains some challenges which I would be happy to explore with you: I am considering the option of being your local barter community developer... if you are okay with it :-)</li>\n\n<li>there will soon be a big need for communication skills, I think :)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThere are still many things to say, and many questions, but I guess this is already enough for the morning! Do you think you could explain concretely how the Economy App would be launched ? Let's imagine one goes for the \"barter month\" option, with 20 unemployed. Which are the steps? What is needed as in skills and tools and material?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-10 09:26:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:24.029006", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1163, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5979, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5946, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/192487bc183ad3657d4462b28b758703155a8b64.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\">\n\nHi everyone, I\u2019m at Mozfest 2016.

Part of my argument is that the 'discoveries' in terms of both theory and practice that propel a field into existence as a meaningful and eventually legitimate discipline are shaped by historical context. Adam Smith, 'moral philosopher' started the field of economics, not because he dreamt up private property, transactions and specialization but because he noticed patterns and gave them names and described models to explain phenomena.\u00a0 Same goes for Futures Literacy and the Discipline of Anticipation, if we are talking about it now, if it is only emergent and still obscure, it is because something that wasn't really evident is now becoming relevant and meaningful.\n\nI also appreciated your insight about back-casting or reverse engineering from many possible futures. However, there is again a distinction here that is important - the future doesn't always need to be used to engineer tomorrow.\u00a0 Not a point that computes easily given the dominant views of the instrumental nature of using the future to \"make a difference\", but important nevertheless.\n\nOn the plausible, possible, probable, preferable distinctions - and the cone version of thinking about the future - I'll admit that I'm on record criticising this position as hopping on one leg (see my article Being Without Existing: The Futures Community at a Turning Point). But it is mainstream.\n\nRegarding the point you attribute to me, I may have given the impression that I want people to use the future more, but I was trying to make the case that we use the future a lot already, I'd like us to use it better.\u00a0 I really appreciated the way you made the comparison to the challenge of wrapping our heads around complexity. Keeping up that paradigmatic shift idea means, at least as I see it, avoiding the cliche expectations of \"greater agency\" and \"uncertain times\" to see that it is about understanding agency differently (not-doing) and welcoming the fact that uncertainty is the one certainty and it is at the origin of our liberty.\u00a0 Are our times more uncertain than 1939 or 1917 or 1848 or ...?\u00a0 Such 'hubris of the now' is common and is a symptom of a lack of Futures Literacy.\n\nNow, turning to the closing section, I understand how the folks at Borghi represented the organizational folk of today - and that it seemed like \"we\" were worried about how \"we\" use the future. And certainly the thrust of the evaluation bit was about how \"we\" could improve the way we use the future. But I hope it was clear that at least for UNESCO the main point was about capacity building and shared sense-making that is not totalizing but empowering - at a grass-roots level.\u00a0 In other words, obviously the ideology of management, the engineering of everything - design the future, command and control, etc. gives pride of place to the capacity of the captain (leader) to use the future to steer the ship of state, corporation, etc. But the whole point about changing the conditions of change, imagining ways and reasons for developing literate (reading and writing) societies, was that it simply opens up all kinds of new possibilities, good and bad, but most of all more diverse, more expressive, more respectful of a basic value choice regarding liberty and diversity. By casting your focus on the games played by the elites to keep their sinking ships of administrative determinism and anti-experimentalism afloat skews the whole point of Futures Literacy, like training the aristocracy in democratic methods. Amusing, but largely not the point - even if in the end in-fighting amongst elites can play a key role in creating a new regime. And this goes for the cult of the expert which is deeply connected to the fundamentally predictive premise of administrative/managerial systems. There may be subversive experts, ones who undermine their own hold on exclusive knowledge, but again that is not the point - the idea, which I tried to get across, I guess unsuccessfully, is that if people start using the phrase 'using the future' the meme is already unleashed, the fit of the virus to the context is general and specific. The time for FL has arrived, even if it is only the beginning. So we're on the same page about accessible and useful, I just want to insist - not as a professional or as an expert - that if I've got an argument about why the world isn't flat I need to insist that this doesn't just mean everyone walks on the world so everyone already knows.\n\nSorry to go on for so long - and I hope this doesn't sound too critical or defensive - just trying to contribute to getting a new story to be a bit more meaningful as something that is new. Not sure that paradigm shifts are doable using prose, but worth a try.\n\nThanks, Riel\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-22 22:51:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:55.091431", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1019, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 760, "user_id": 3431, "topic_id": 727, "post_number": 1, "raw": "FRONTIZO (\u201cI care\u201d in Greek) is an initiative taken in 2009, by some people who are either professional or have some relation to the elderly and disabled individuals in the city Patras. We saw that there were substantial needs to be covered, so we felt it was appropriate to make such a collective effort to mainly support individuals belonging to these vulnerable groups.\n\nWith a rapidly increasing elderly population in Greece, our aim is to highlight and defend the rights of the elderly. There are many things that the wider public doesn\u2019t know, such as specificities of various incurable diseases, so we started to create synergies and partnerships to cover these needs.\n\nToday, there are 200,000 patients with dementia in Greece, corresponding to 6% of the total elderly population. These figures are certainly expected to increase. Current projections double the number of elderly by 2050, something that will undoubtedly affect these numbers. Therefore, the services and efforts to be made collectively are large and need to be further strengthened.\n\nAt the beginning, there was no clear knowledge on the issues and needs of elderly assistance. We could not identify these people, because in Greece there are no structures -and structured policy, in general- for dementia. Therefore, it was not easy for people to understand the benefits of our actions, which had to be communicated by word of mouth from scratch. Those initial difficulties were overcome as our interventions started becoming more visible, and as the spirit of cooperation developed with the patients and their caregivers over time.\n\nWe are interested in entering the homes of these people because in most times they do not even get out of their homes. It's not the same to meet with them in a public institution, compared to entering into their homes.\n\nSince we cannot do many things by ourselves, establishing collaborations is imperative for the expansion of our operations and to ensure resources. We work with the local government, mainly the Region of Western Greece, and with associations of patients with whom we organize activities and events for the dissemination of knowledge and solidarity. Through those collaborations with diverse stakeholders, we acquire more knowledge in dementia, and the training of family carers.\n\nOur interventions occur in physical and mental level, helping the recovery process and educating caregivers on how they can give proper care. This is done by a team consisting of a social worker, a trainer, a physiotherapist and a nurse. The aim is to keep the patients\u2019 good aspects, to maintain their functional and mental status (such as orientation, memory, etc.) and assist them with their behavior. Many times, these people have a lot of stress, anxiety or depression, so they calm through our intervention. Caregivers, who are not aware of basic issues before entering the program, receive training that allows them to continue their work after the end of the intervention, which always has a specific duration. These people are very actively looking for information and, as we enter their home, there is a direct interaction. We have observed a reduction of the stress and burden felt by of caregivers. Let us not forget that we live in a difficult time and they are people who have their own issues (family, finances, etc.), so the pressure is too high. Of course, all our services are free.\n\nWe are very satisfied with the hitherto results of our initiative. Because from a point where there was nothing and the state has not been completely inactive in this field, we now see that more and more caregivers seek for our advice. Through the creation of partnerships and through hard work, this effort is now recognized. At the local level, the authorities understand the value of our work and want to support us to further evolve these services.\n\nWhat we also observe, is an increasing flow of volunteers. We continue to do actions within the community, targeting the general elderly population, and offering information and tips on healthy lifestyle, diet, and exercise. The beneficiaries may come in contact with our activities digitally, via the<a href=\"http://www.frodizo.gr/en/\"> website</a> and through social networks.\n\nIn general, there is a lack of public understanding about the issue of dementia in Greece. Therefore, the response to our call was not so evident at the beginning, due to this ignorance. We had to face, of course, the classic issues the grassroots initiatives are facing in Greece. For example, the fact that the state was very slow in harmonizing the legislation on how organizations of civil society should operate. Since then, however, as our activities were broadly communicated and because the program is organized in 6-month long circles, there was an increase in the number of both beneficiaries and volunteers. We currently serve 20 people in each circle, and we have so far registered about 60 people (patients and their families). By the end the year, we estimate to have surpassed 3000 home visits.\n\nIn FRODIZO, we are all young people and the whole intervention is non-medical. This is why at the beginning, there was suspicion towards our actions. Over time, we have generated significant experience, as well as a database of beneficiaries facing problems related to dementia, and their carers. Hence, we now feel more confident and secure, since we have been in direct contact with the challenge for so long. Also, we were able to get in touch with larger organizations, developed teamwork and discipline because these interventions must be always characterized by formality and consistency.\n\nBroadly speaking, we cannot cover all needs by ourselves, because they are huge. We want to attract more people around us to meet the challenge in the best possible way. Dealing with this kind of work is a special opportunity for young scientists who can provide major services to society, especially to its most vulnerable parts. These actions deserve to be recognized by the society, to be studied and supported.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-20 18:31:38", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 13:10:27.475144", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1042, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29502, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 4094, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>happy to share the gig</b>\n\nas @noemi mentioned, I am ready to test edgesense.\n\nalso would like to share tasks/gig with others to have a more lively discussion on these tools.

She was born in 2007 with an extremely rare and complex heart defect. We flew around the world to find a solution for her heart to function as close to normality and we found it. In 2008 in Boston, on the day she was discharged from the hospital with a fixed heart, we discovered she is profoundly deaf. Acquired deafness from the many medical procedures and medication she had for supporting her heart function in her\u00a0first months of life. Right now she is a perfectly normal 9 years old and her hearing is provided by a cochlear implant. The journey to normality was not over yet. Cochlear implants provide only the access to sound, but the brain needs to get used to decoding the sounds it receives. So going down that tortuous road and understanding how a late diagnosis can make auditory-verbal rehabilitation\u00a0much harder,\u00a0I started thinking about solutions for\u00a0children who are already diagnosed and also for those\u00a0that will to be born and possibly suffer from\u00a0congenital hearing loss.\u00a0\n\nIn 2013 I started an NGO - Asociatia Sonia Maria, willing to get involved\u00a0in providing solutions for children with hearing loss and congenital cardiac diseases. I counselled families of children born with congenital complex cardiac diseases in order to access health care abroad. I helped them transfer their children to a cardiac centre in Munich, Germany where their health issues met the needed medical care. Parents reached out to me for advice and\u00a0support, I helped them contact the clinic and maintain the contact with medical staff abroad. Other times I just I brought medication that was not available in my home country\u00a0or found a connections in countries where needed medication was available and managed\u00a0bringing it to Romania. This saved my daughter\u2019s life at birth, and other children further on. At times I flew with families to Germany, discussed with doctors and supported them during the hard times their children underwent complex surgeries. Once we started dealing with hearing loss, it\u00a0broadened my area of issues that needed to be addressed.\u00a0\n\nIn 2015 I opened Casa Koala, the first family centred auditory-verbal centre in Romania, with the help of an Australian speech therapist. Viktorija McDonnel\u00a0relocated in Bucharest for two months to help us kick start the project. In Romania there is no other rehabilitation\u00a0centre especially designed for children with hearing loss wearing cochlear implants. We hold individual weekly sessions in the centre and for children living in remote areas we provide tele practice. Children and their families have the opportunity to access this\u00a0program especially created to help families of deaf\u00a0children\u00a0on their road to learning to listen and speak. With a team of three people we try to change the way in which families relate to\u00a0therapy. We\u00a0are trying to\u00a0build\u00a0a community of people who are informed, counselled and supported on their path to speech rehabilitation.\n\nHaving access to information and seeing how much harder it is for children to acquire speech when they are diagnosed at a late age, I am making efforts to create a Bill that will implement mandatory neonatal hearing screening in all the maternities in Romania. This will mean that\u00a0all the children born deaf will\u00a0be diagnosed at birth and\u00a0they will have the best chance in receiving the proper medical care, the devices that will give them full access to sounds and further on a fair chance in rehabilitation.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-24 22:32:40", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 16:36:15.495126", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 620, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5667, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5634, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello everyone, as end of May is approaching we are about to reach an\u00a0important milestone in the<a href=\"/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296\"> Op3nCare Fellowships Program</a>: we will reward some of the most promising stories of community led care\u00a0on June 1st, and show some love to community members who have put in time to write down their experience.\u00a0\n\n<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-7cbeb5da-dd40-63f3-a018-f312a64e6011\">At this initial stage,\u00a0250 EUR fees will reward written contributions that are already full fledged</b><b>\u00a0stories or less edited ideas with\u00a0potential to\u00a0be developed into longer\u00a0posts (this is to be agreed\u00a0on a case by case basis).\u00a0Fellows will also be\u00a0asked to make themselves available to their peers here online.

We were on our way to this new music festival that had such a cool location and line-up that it convinced a couple of non-festival goers from Bucharest who had never been that far North-West to plan a weekend getaway around it. In between changing radio stations searching for oldies but goldies we could shamelessly karaoke to (hello, Rod Stewart), I told my friend of this witty American blog I\u2019d just discovered and spent hours on, reading the comments. It was smart, open-minded, feminist. \u2018Do you think anyone in Romania reads it? Wouldn\u2019t it be cool to have a local version?\u2019</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>An hour later we came up with a name and by the time we reached Cluj, it had a first edition sketched out on a yellow notebook with a drawing of a rabbit hugging a catatonic bearded guy. It would be an online publication with first-person accounts of young adults telling of their journeys towards maturity. It\u2019d have plenty of women\u2019s stories, since it was a thinly veiled excuse to surround ourselves with experiences that made us feel less alone in our own search for versions of adulthood that made sense to us. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>I had no idea how we were going to make it happen, but at that moment it seemed like </span><span>all the resources I would need I could find among my friends and their friends</span><span>. The life stories, the photoshoots, the illustrations, the interviews, the translations, the programming. No money used except for event supplies and web hosting. The first edition happened through the work of 50+ people who each contributed in a way that made them feel part of something that reflected a part of them.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>It\u2019s not all rainbows and unicorns. Working without money, or actually bringing money from home can be rough. The doubt that it will ever become sustainable is still there. In fact, the publication was going through a slump when I first heard about Edgeryders, a couple of months ago. When I understood that it was a community of people also working with limited resources on passion projects they believe make a difference, I felt relieved. Some people are pushing through. And I had a way to reach them. My biggest question now is </span><span>how to build resilient teams that manage to withstand uncertainty </span><span>and that's what I\u2019m coming to the </span><a href=\"/t/workshop-under-construction-collaborative/4466\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.38; text-decoration: none;\"><span>#Futurespotters workshop</span></a><span> to learn. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>A trademark of our times, uncertainty is here to stay. We can live in constant anxiety about not knowing what we\u2019ll be doing in 5 years\u2019 time, or we can ride the wave of fast change and get our input into it. And we can ask for help. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>It used to be a sign of weakness, but asking for help nowadays seems like common sense. The better you ask and explain what your challenges are, the better help you\u2019ll get. In communities of bootstrapped projects, </span><span>helping out is a form of investment</span><span> - you don\u2019t get to cash out, but you do get a gift card of skills, advice and know-how which you probably couldn\u2019t have afforded if price tags were to be set. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Have you reached the limits of your circle of friends? Well, there\u2019s a community of 2.600+ people from all over the world curious about what you\u2019re doing and able to point to some direction - maybe even partner up. And there are 50 people from Bucharest already signed up. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/en/spot-the-future-bucharest\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.38; text-decoration: none;\"><span>Spot the Future</span></a><span> is scanning for grassroots projects that hint to where Bucharest might be heading, should alternative initiatives find ways to thrive.

On the one hand, we can reach the maximum amount of people by doing several things in parallel: data geeks might like MoN better, whereas designers will flock to Ezio etc. But on the other hand, we need to learn from each other and share tools, and we cannot do that if, say, Marco is talking about healthonomics in one room at the same time that Zoe is hacking devices in another room.\u00a0\n\nI recommend prioritising mutual learning over engagement.

This is actually my preferred outcome provided that MoN can be pre-produced\u00a0<em>a lot.</em>\u00a0For example, this was made in one-day hackathon, but the main graph had been pro-produced; and that meant finding the data, downloading them, cleaning them, and writing the Python script that put it in network form.

An experienced web communicator, project manager and analyst, I excel at managing complex flows of information and believe in the power of collective intelligence. My sense of observation helps me to assess internal and external needs of businesses and governments. For several years, I\u2019ve been passionate about open government. It has mostly meant observing other countries develop initiatives while being utterly disappointed for not putting my shoulder to the wheel, since Quebec is not yet an open government. For five years, I have created projects that promote transparency, participation and citizen engagement. In 2007, I presented Zonegrippeaviaire to the government of Quebec. This project aimed to engage the public to prepare for a pandemic, with plans and strategies designed to involve citizens directly. This year, I collaborated with Government in the Lab (Massachusetts, USA) to propose open government strategies of organizational transformation. In December 2010, we designed the Open Government and Francophonie project, similar to the Open Government Partnership, but adapted to OIF Francophone countries. I was able to influence the government of Quebec to include an open government component in an analysis of the potential of Web 2.0.\n\n<em>Why Edgeryders?</em> That each one of us has the opportunity to attain the highest vision of who she/he is: shouldn't it be the goal of every State? Every flower in the fields tries to grow as straight and as high as possible, to hatch all the splendor of his beautiful petals. It's the same for human beings. We have within us a force (empowerment) that drives us to transcendence. Each person is unique and wonderful. The Edgeryders recognize the potential of each, try to identify problems and seek collective solutions to eliminate barriers to development. An orphan of open government, until this new type of governance is adopted by Quebec, I'm so passionate about this and I believe so much in its potential for society that I do not want to wait a second longer to participate. To be a \"global citizen\" has a special connotation for me: I know that we are all connected to each other, not only through social media. This connection also exists in the immaterial world: we are a localized part of a unified field of consciousness. Therefore, whether one is located here or there, it does not really matter. Solutions that will be imagined and created by the Edgeryders will have a positive impact on improving systems, policies and structures, and ultimately on the quality of life of countless of communities of citizens. I like how the Edgeryders show optimism, pay attention to solutions, and seek collaboration to determine the \"right\" priorities and areas for development. I wish us good luck!\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-07 09:59:47", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 13:23:58.321695", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 675, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15912, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 1225, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>wow....what an on going story </b>\n\nI just wanted to say that u can inspire alot of people and I think u do along the way with ur story .

In particular, I like the notion of \u201cmaterializing\u201d, to be paralleled to the one of \u201cinfrastructuring\u201d. Is the this term (\u201cmaterializing\u201d), <em>used with this meaning in this context</em>, based on some theoretical background ?\n\nI also like the title of your post: <strong><em>Emerging digital space of possibilities</em></strong><em>.</em>\n\nAre you proposing it as the title of the paper? (my original one was <strong>Infrastructuring spaces of possibilities.</strong>)\n\nMaybe we could use the one you propose with a subtitle as:\n\n<em>\u201c</em><em>From on-line conversations to on-site collaborations. The OpenCare case\u201d.</em>\n\n<strong>(2)</strong> Beyond this, I re-propose you a question already raised in my last post:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Having a digital space of possibility, what could be the most general term to name <em>everything </em>happens in it?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nUntil now I referred to \u201cevents\u201d (as the most general term) and \u201cconversations\u201d (as the core of what we will consider in this discussion. In the OpenCare website, when somebody upload a case, this is called a \u201cstory\u201d: is this a term usable by us, with some theoretical background?

What you will find is <em>only </em>the integration of my DRAFT<strong>1</strong> proposal with the 2+1 hypotheses: nothing else, coming for the followed discussion, has been integrated yet: could you work on it?\n\nIn any case, in my view a main point is still missing, both in contents and formal terms:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>To make clear 2-3 main concepts on which the paper is built (at the moment we have: digital space of possibilities; conversations; infrastructuring; materializing ; \u2026 ) In my view, these main concepts must be not so many and, possibly, they should be grounded in a strong and recognizable (by RESET) theory.</li>\n\n<li>To give the sense and of the +1 hypothesis on the hacker approach opportunities</li>\n\n<li>To indicate the political meaning of what we are proposing</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>NB</strong> on length: at the moment, DRAFT<strong>2 </strong>, as it is now, is 521 words long.

Where OpenCare is an on-going European research delivered by a consortium of universities and the grassroots hacker community. </em>\n\n<em>OpneCare main goal is prototyping a community-driven model of addressing social and health care. It is based on three elements: advances in collective intelligence research, to lend coherence and summarize large-scale online debates; advances in digital fabrication and cheap-and-open hardware technology; and the rise of a global hacker community, willing and able to look for solutions to care problems. At this point of time, OpenCare is arrived at half of its journey: the prototype of care-oriented digital space is already working at the real scale; different kinds of conversations are taking place; in-depth observations on them, and on its overall functioning, can be done.</em>\n\n<em>This article moves from these conversations-in-their-environment and discusses when and how an initial trigger (such as a post presenting an idea or a story) generates an online conversation that, in turn, may evolve and become \u2013 in our case- an in-situ care-related activity. </em>\n\n<em>According to the OpenCare nature and intentions, these events are not directly generated and/or supported by the OpenCare team. Nevertheless, the way in which the digital space is organized, and the affordances that characterize it, play a role in when and how conversations start and evolve in collaborations (that, in turn, can, or cannot, move from the digital to the physical space).</em>\n\n<em>These OpenCare research activities have been based on 3 main working hypotheses:</em>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>it is possible to create a (care-oriented) digital space of possibilities where</em><em> different kinds of self-organized (care-oriented) conversations can emerge and evolve towards (care-oriented) conversations for action.</em></li>\n\n<li><em>it is possible to</em><em> embed in the digital space of possibilities some specific affordances, thanks to which (care-oriented) conversations have higher probabilities to emerge and evolve towards conversations for action. </em></li>\n\n<li><em>(the experiences in open systems and the hackers approach, considered in a radical way, offer innovative guidelines also when the care issue is concerned.</em></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<em>Given these hypotheses, and given the prototype of care-oriented space of possibilities OpenCare realized, the paper core research specific questions are: Are these hypotheses verified? What can we learn from the first months of experience? </em>\n\n<em>To answer this question, OpenCare team observes how the realised full scale prototype od space of possibilities worked, considering: (1) the dynamic of the events\u00a0 (different kind of interactions and conversations) that are taking place and (2) the role of the space of possibilities and its affordance in making that dynamic happen.</em>\n\n<em>The paper presents</em><em>, some experiences of \u201cdoing together\u201d (in the digital and in the physical space) and analyses and discusses the relationships between them and the digital environment affordances. In particular, the paper presents and discusses:</em>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>different examples of conversation, using ethnographic tools to evaluate their original culture and motivations and the way they changed moving on in their beginning towards different kinds of \u201cdoing together\u201d.</em></li>\n\n<li><em>different infrastructuring actions, done by the OpenCare team, in order to modify and up-grade the systems affordances\u00a0</em></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<em>The article conclusions introduce some thread of research to be developed in the next months, inside the same OpenCare, and after its conclusion.\u00a0</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-31 08:24:51", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:53.742711", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1087, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23154, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1243, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Apport d'une pratique des Fran\u00e7ais, point en faveur de diversit\u00e9</b>\n\nMerci beaucoup, Alberto, d'avoir soulev\u00e9 ces questions. Les r\u00e9ponses fournies par Michel Filippi m'aident \u00e0 mieux comprendre quel r\u00f4le un philosophe joue aupr\u00e8s d'instances gouvernementales et des communaut\u00e9s de pratique form\u00e9es par des citoyens.\n\nLes grands leaders de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise ont souvent recours \u00e0 des philosophes pour les guider et les \u00e9clairer, dans des dossiers difficiles, ou pour essayer de comprendre vers quoi tend la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\nCes deux derni\u00e8res semaines, Michel Filippi nous fait d\u00e9couvrir, petit \u00e0 petit, la philosophie exp\u00e9rimentale, ou ce qu'il qualifie de <strong>non</strong>-philosophie.\n\nDans le milieu du gouvernement ouvert, nous avons crois\u00e9 depuis mars 2009 de nombreuses\u00a0 'unconferences' ou '<strong>non</strong>-conf\u00e9rences', la <a href=\"http://joyrenee.wordpress.com/2009/04/03/gov20camp-wdc/\">premi\u00e8re ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e</a> par le Dr <a href=\"http://www.markdrapeau.com/about/\">Marc Drapeau</a> et acolytes. Par cons\u00e9quent, cette approche de non-philosophie, je trouve qu'elle colle tr\u00e8s bien avec les tendances observ\u00e9es jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent dans la sph\u00e8re du gouvernement ouvert.\n\nAyant eu un parcours professionnel en arts visuels, je suis habitu\u00e9e de co-exister avec des artistes exp\u00e9rimentaux et multidisciplinaires. Certaines personnes disent que ces gens font des choses bizarres! Ils explorent les possibilit\u00e9s des m\u00e9diums et franchissent les fronti\u00e8res de l'inconnu. Au Qu\u00e9bec, ce genre d'artistes a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une nouvelle toile sociale: un r\u00e9seau de centres d'artistes autor\u00e9g\u00e9s. Ce n'est pas d'hier. Cela fait d\u00e9j\u00e0 une vingtaine d'ann\u00e9es que ces artistes s'affairent \u00e0 refaire le monde au Qu\u00e9bec. L'art exp\u00e9rimental est ainsi devenu non seulement un mod\u00e8le d'excellence, mais c'est devenu la nouvelle norme. Via le RCAAQ (<a href=\"http://www.rcaaq.org/\">Regroupement des centres d'artistes autog\u00e9r\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9ebec</a>), en lien avec d'autres lieux ailleurs dans le monde, s'est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 tout un univers de cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9, qui a remplac\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s d'anciennes structures d\u00e9suettes.\n\n\u00c0 mon avis, artistes, artisans, philosophes, penseurs ont de nombreux points en commun. Ils nous aident \u00e0 porter un regard neuf sur le monde.\n\nPar ailleurs, bien qu'il n'y ait pas encore de gouvernement ouvert en France, le mouvement des donn\u00e9es ouvertes (open data) a effectu\u00e9 de nettes avanc\u00e9es. Le 17 mars 2011 \u00e0 Issy-les-Moulineaux, Microsoft France a organis\u00e9 un atelier de r\u00e9flexion intitul\u00e9 'Open data et nous et nous?'. Un philosophe - <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Stiegler\">Bernard Stiegler</a>, directeur de l'Institut de recherche et d'innovation (<a href=\"http://www.iri.centrepompidou.fr/\">IRI, Centre Pompidou</a>) - a ouvert le bal. <a href=\"http://danactu-resistance.over-blog.com/article-bernard-stiegler-en-entretien-sur-l-importance-de-l-open-data-69436412.html\">Il a dit </a>que <span><strong>l'open data est \u00abun \u00e9v\u00e9nement d\u2019une ampleur comparable \u00e0 l\u2019apparition de l\u2019alphabet\u00bb.</strong></span> Wow. J'en veux des tas d'autres d\u00e9clarations de ce genre!\n\nJe constate qu'il s'agit d'une sorte de tendance <em>naturelle </em>des Fran\u00e7ais, d'associer la philosophie aux d\u00e9bats sur la gouvernance ouverte: une <strong>pratique positive</strong> que les gens de la France nous offrent. J'aimerais beaucoup que arrivions, chez Edgeryders, \u00e0 mettre en valeur cette pratique, comme preuve justificative que la <strong>diversit\u00e9 </strong>dans une sph\u00e8re donn\u00e9e, cela apporte d'habitude d'heureux r\u00e9sultats.\n\nNous n'avons malheureusement pas de philosophes qui fr\u00e9quentent la colline parlementaire au Qu\u00e9bec, et je ne suis pas en mesure de parler pour d'autres nations. Mais peut-\u00eatre que cela pourrait changer, si l'exp\u00e9rience Edgeryders s'av\u00e8re int\u00e9ressante?\n\nEn tout cas, je suis tr\u00e8s heureuse que Michel Filippi se retrouve dans l'espace Edgeryders, et soit dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 collaborer avec nous. Qu'il y ait davantage de philosophes et d'artistes, je suis toujours en faveur d'une telle proposition!\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-05 16:55:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:08.558492", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 686, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13355, "user_id": 809, "topic_id": 1407, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>Thanks for the link</b>\n\nIn Romania we have an online community dedicated to the same purpose.

I particularly like your categorisation of enabling factors. I hadn't come across Denis Postle's work before but looks like there are some good leads to follow up there. It resonates with Ivan Illich's critique in Tools for Conviviality - dominance of technocratic elites and radical monopolies in the field of 'mutual caring, rapport and cooperation' to use a phrase from the psyCommons backstory. I particularly love Illich's description of the kitchen table in his interviews with Caley as being a place of recovering what our modern universities have lost in the \"search for truth\". \"Friendship is required first, the search for truth\u00a0is based on the creation of the 'we'.\"\n\nMy questions on policy are not intended to\u00a0dismiss\u00a0the efforts of policymakers. My interest is more in how we\u00a0gain\u00a0a better understanding of the limits of policy as a tool or instrument to ensure wiser use of\u00a0range of tools and practices which will achieve the desired outcomes of policy. In writing this response I'm reminded of two things. One something Michael Spence (of Schumacher College) wrote in <em>After Capitalism</em> about what happens to laws when they become written - which I must dig out and re-read as I think this might connect to a particular limit of policy. The other Margaret Wheatley's book <em>A Simpler Way,</em>\u00a0which as you may know, unpacks the\u00a0obsession of the so-called civilized world,\u00a0dating back to Victorian times with the world descending into chaos without man imposing order - while\u00a0new science is revealing that order is a natural tendency and that we need to get better at how we\u00a0work with that so as not to disrupt it. So I guess another way of coming at the question could be:\u00a0what do policies look like that support natural responses to care and welfare rather than prescribe interventions and methods? Policies that are more generative in relation to those enabling factors you've outlined. And beyond this... perhaps something fundamental about how we reconfigure the role of the State from a living systems perspective.\n\nthanks again\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-18 10:06:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:49.502669", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 383, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1326, "user_id": 551, "topic_id": 1293, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n\n<!--\n\n@page { margin: 2cm }\n\nP.sdfootnote { margin-left: 0.5cm; text-indent: -0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-size: 10pt }\n\nP { margin-bottom: 0.21cm }\n\nA.sdfootnoteanc { font-size: 57% }\n\n--></style>\n\n<strong>L'avenir de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mondiale passe, sans aucun doute, par de nouveaux d\u00e9veloppements de l'Internet et une intensification marqu\u00e9e de ses usages collectifs globaux, continentaux, r\u00e9gionaux et locaux. </strong>(Cf, dans un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent billet, l'opendata, le partage des ressources de donn\u00e9es et la tendance marqu\u00e9e vers le <a href=\"http://jackydegueldre.blogspot.com/2011/04/simple-citoyen-single-citizen-la.html\">#gouvernement_ouvert, l'e-governance plus l'open-government)</a>.\n\nAussi, \u00e0 l'heure o\u00f9 l'on \u00e9voque comme une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 quasiment acquise - en \u00ab r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e \u00bb bien s\u00fbr - le Web 3.0, ce web s\u00e9mantique r\u00e9gi par un syst\u00e8mes de m\u00e9tadonn\u00e9es o\u00f9 les r\u00e9seaux sociaux commenceraient \u00e0 s'interconnecter pour parler ensemble, est-il temps de s'interroger utilement.\n\nAlors m\u00eame qu'un Joel de Rosnay, p\u00e8re spirituel du <a href=\"http://www.pronetaire.com/les_auteurs/\"><em>pron\u00e9tariat</em></a>, pense d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 un Web 4.0, un <em>web symbiotique</em> en connexion permanente et universelle, en <em>symbiose ubiquitaire</em>, avec l'intelligence collective ambiante, <strong>ne faudrait-il pas jeter d'urgence les bases formelles et connectiques d'un encore utopique \\#GlobalSocialNetwork\u00b3, mod\u00e9liser un r\u00e9seau mondial des r\u00e9seaux de r\u00e9seaux associatifs?</strong> Afin que tous ceux qui oeuvrent semblablement au bien commun, au sein de l'\u00e9norme mouvance associative des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s civiles, partout dans le monde et dans divers domaines d'implication sociale, soient interconnect\u00e9s, audibles, visibles et compr\u00e9hensibles de leurs pairs.

It is too early to tell, and I am also not really sure what is the best way of doing and integrating it. We'll run out of minutes (180 for a no-pay account) on the next community call. I think it might make sense to archive a lo-fi version of the call on ER and only have the last one up for discussion and linking to it. The other thing is that I am thinking about a way to say something \"off the record\". Of course there's issues with that, and it would make some sort of editing necessary. I like transparency, but I think extremely strong transparency can get in the way of potentially good dynamics as well... I don't think I have a hard and fast rule on this though. I'd probably want to \"spread\" these decisions throughout the community with the persons acting having a relatively large say.\n\nThe bettermeans.com video was interesting - thanks for that. I have a few visions some of which are somewhat similar (e.g. <a href=\"/t/anyone-here-heard-of-jmg-and-the-green-wizards/4408/3\">2nd paragraph</a>) under the hood, but I am not a fan of the interface. I generally agree with the hierarchy of communication channels you gave, though my take is that we'll have to do a lot of trade offs so video will be the exception. The scenario I am designing for is one where most of us are very busy. Many doing menial and intermittent tasks, or agricultural work. Hardware performance is similar as today (but electronics lifetime increased), connectivity varies a lot by location (rural vs urban, energy dense vs starved). Sitting at home working with clean hands using pointer and screen will be reserved for a small minority, the rest use very rugged devices adapted to their physical work. The reason why I tend to favor audio is that it comes with a couple of strong pros: 1) your hands are free 2) it needs extremely little energy (works fine in the dark) 3) you can easily make or fix the i/o device 4) since we killed off most dangerous megafauna we only need our ears very intermittently 5) we pretty much come with spoken language pre-installed - written not so much 6) emotions can be reliably communicated 7) relatively frugal in terms of data storage 8) speech -&gt; text -&gt; arbitrary language (with fuzziness) -&gt; speech is hopefully \"around the corner\".\n\nThat is why the bread and butter jobs will probably be going through audio. Of course intensive interaction with the collaborative platform will happen intermittently for very many people (think visit to library or committee meeting), and may also be a full time occupation of some networkers. Both will use a lot more channels than audio. However, even in that case text will be probably restricted to a supporting role for aspects that require low ambiguity, and as a general rule the bandwidth of the optical channel will be required for fast orientation, navigation, discrimination, and pattern perception. Input would probably be based on hand/finger gestures and facial expression.\n\nSummaries are of course essential (but also very political). Browsing through lots of unsuitably structured text is a losing proposition, but data synthesis comes with loss. My preferred approach would be to keep as much raw data as possible, as local as possible - with making provisions to make it searchable in an abstracted form and request a full data set in a smooth manner. E.g. individuals tag/comment/picto certain parts of the file appropriately, perhaps also while the discussion/presentation is ongoing. Then you could supplement a human made summary with automated \"highlights\" using various perspectives (e.g. based on sets of tags, or composites of individuals - like the members of a project). That reminds me, @Matthias - it may be useful to be able to @mention a project which will send a nudge to the involved individuals. That shouldn't be terribly difficult technically I think.\n\nIf you have the audio you could probably do most of that at some later point when the infrastructure is ready. For the projects that get a little more hands on or are happening in an unMon you could do video (stills or moving by activation) from a couple of angles by default. It is likely that is can be relatively easily squeezed into a platform like bettermeans, ER, or something else altogether. The worst that can happen is a human transcript - which is a lot better than straight into the text box for people like me. I lose half my brain capacity when writing. During dialogues I think I perform better than if I can concentrate in a quiet environment alone (at least for the more creative bits).\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-28 22:51:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.967571", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 836, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25350], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28019, "user_id": 1434, "topic_id": 1839, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Lucan Cooks + AIDE Associazione Indipendente delle Donne + IDA</b>\n\nThe aim is to involve the greatest number of people and especially materani community.\n\nConcerning the kitchen it doesn't need to be very big.

True of false?[/quote]\n\nCan be true, but I think it's not necessarily recommendable to make the effort. Matrix is not a single platform, but a messaging protocol with multiple client software applications, for example for Android, iOS etc.. We don't force people to have a certain e-mail address or Skype address when signing up for Edgeryders. We could, of course (similar to how the early Facebook Messenger would automatically give you a XMPP / Jabber handle so you could chat with anyone using that open protocol).\n\nI think it depends on what we want to do with Matrix. If it's for company and team internal communications only (20-30 ppl), then account integration is not needed. Here, integration would rather mean having a field in your edgeryders.eu forum software profile that mentions your Matrix handle, and links to a chat with you on the riot.edgeryders.eu Javascript Matrix client. If Matrix is for connecting with community members as well, then of course we do integration. In that case, we can even think about using the Matrix Javascript SDK to integrate messaging right on the site, rather than using a Riot Matrix client on a subdomain. In that case, login integration is for free, but the interface may be more limited than with Riot.\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:2, topic:6273\"]We still need APIs for batch data analysis, the equivalent of Drupal JSON views. For example, I like to induce project-specific interaction networks using Tulip. You mention a custom component that outputs the whole thing as JSON, basically a dump of the whole database. I am not sure this will work \u2013 I can see timeout problems, for example. It simply shifts the API issue somewhere else \u2013 now you need APIs to query a monster JSON. Is it not better to bite the bullet and have APIs on our own DB?[/quote]\n\nThe full JSON dump is an example. With the same ease, we can add a few more export options, including some that include parameters (\"ederyders.eu/export/json?group=123&amp;fullcontent=y\"). 4-5 different, parameterized types of exports would feel reasonable, and should enable all work in external software. We just have to think in advance what export options make sense.\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:2, topic:6273\"]We will still have the equivalent of groups or projects. Maybe this will be \"boards\" in Thredded, not sure in Discourse? This is important both at the Ux level and at the data/project evaluation level. I have explained this point in some detail <a href=\"/t/a-future-tweak-group-based-challenge-responses-for-better-analytics/6238\">here</a>. True or false?[/quote]\n\nCan be true. Thredded's message boards would however be the equivalent of \"challenges\", and called that way. In general of course, we can introduce any concept we want to the datamodel, as it's custom code in the future. In this case, I'd propose a lightweight solution as follows. We keep \"Challenges\" as the one and only ordering concept that a frontend user is exposed to (similar to how OpenIDEO does it, feels nice and simple). Plus, we would implement an equivalent of the current \"Challenge Chains\", which logically groups together any set of challenges and their responses. They'd have a page that acts as the start page of a project like OpenCare.\n\nThen, for data analysis teh challenge chain ID can be used as parameter in JSON exports etc.. While for web analytics, we can sum up visit counts to multiple challenges using a custom Google Analytics view, or if that is not possible, set a custom parameter inside the tracking code to the challenge chain ID and base tracking on that. There are quite some sophisticated things inside Analytics that we have not yet tapped into. (Note: Currently in Drupal, Challenge Chains belong to groups, so with SQL subqueries it would be possible to get all challenge responses that belong to a group transitively via a challenge chain.)\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:2, topic:6273\"]Edgesense will work via APIs - Catalyst protocol. The existing code base is completely reused, we only need to\"feed it\" JSON files as extracted from the APIs. True or False?[/quote]\n\nThat's right.\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:2, topic:6273\"]We lose Open Ethnographer. We'll have to re-implement it, because it is an important part of our methodology. RECODE, is completely based on it (but it does have a money and time budget for software. OE needs plenty of work on user interface and utility, but it works quite well at the data level. What are your thoughts around that?[/quote]\n\nIntegrating OE closely with Drupal was done b/c we expected ordinary users to try their hand at ethnographic coding. That \"massively parallel\" coding did not materialize, so for re-implementing it I recommend making it a sweet, small stand-alone Ruby application on a subdomain. Like oe.edgeryders.eu. It would be connected to the main site with an API that feeds it updates with new pieces of content (posts and comments). Each piece of content will only be sent once (ignoring future edits), but a few days after the original post date ass the chance of future edits is then small enough to ignore it. We can re-use Annotator.js, our changes to the Annotator.js UI and re-implement the whole data model of how annotations are saved externally. Since we also do not have to deal with Drupal, implementation would take 30% the effort of the original version.\n\nUntil that happens, we may choose to run Drupal in parallel just for researchers to use Open Ethnographer, but I doubt that it's worth it.\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:2, topic:6273\"]Related to the last point: right now, OpenCare stuff feeds into a piece of software called <a href=\"http://164.132.58.138:9000/#/dashboard/globalView\">GraphRyder</a> (not displaying properly at the time of writing), one of the main artifacts of OpenCare. Again, this is not integrated with edgeryders.eu, but it does rely on APIs for both content (like Edgesense) and also OpenEthno annotations. This is something we'd like to keep ideally. It will be further developed in the course of OpenCare and (if we get it) RECODE. You do have a plan for all of this (Annotator.js), but I am not familiar enough with Open Ethnographer: is it like Edgesense, independent from edgeryders.eu installation? Something that you only need to feed an API call?[/quote]\n\nOpen Ethnographer comes in two parts: data storage of codes and annotations is tightly integrated with Drupal, everything Annotator.js related (incl. the AJAX interface for tagging) is modular enough to be re-used easily as it's all JavaScript. Why you ask that, do you want an OE-style annotation interface implemented inside GraphRyder?\n\nI suggest we make it a principle that all our analysis tools are little stand-alone software pieces, reside on one edgeryders.eu subdomain each, and use only <em>public</em> APIs to get their data (no authentication needed, anonymization done by the API server software as needed). In that case, GraphRyder would reside at gr.edgeryders.eu, pull content from edgeryders.eu, and annotations from oe.edgeryders.eu.", "created_at": "2017-05-08 12:01:31", "updated_at": "2018-01-20 12:39:52.577150", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1248, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [7099], "is_reply_to": [7099], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10431, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 2199, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Community MT2019 stuff</b>\n\nGREAT!

Some scholars \u2013 myself included \u2013 are looking to deploy open decision making processes, so that many people might participate through collective intelligence dynamics; but such processes are nowhere near ready to go. Most people appear to think that the concentration of decision making power is a necessary evil, but it does create a tension between the few in the decision room and the many who stand outside it.\n\n###Diversity trumps ability\n\nIn 2004 economists Lu Hong and Scott Page came up with a radically new idea: diverse group perform better in solving complex problems than groups composed of the best people available. In a nutshell, diversity trumps ability. It works like this: imagine a group faced with a difficult problem. \"Difficult\" in this context means it is not even clear what kind of a problem it is. The only way towards solving it appears to be trying to attack it with different approaches, and hope that one will work. Further, imagine that each person in the group has mastered a limited number of approaches to problems, and that each approach solves well a few types of problems, but is useless on all others. An example could be a car whose engine won't start. The problem could be of mechanical nature; or of electrical nature; or in the software of the onboard electronics; it could even be that there is no fuel in the tank. If all you have to throw at the problem is ten mechanics, even very good ones, that might not help you if the problem is in the electric circuitry. [b]A group with diverse skills can try more approaches, and so have a higher probability of coming to a solution. It follows that, when faced with a difficult problem, your best bet is to build a very diverse group to attack it[/b] ([paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16385.full)).\n\nThis seems to make sense. So how come political and cultural \u00e9lites tend to be so homogenous? Why do we not see more skaters in ministries, athletes in boards of directors, circus artists heading charities? There are many reasons for this, but one of the most important is that collaborating in diversity is hard. Cultural differences get in the way of communication; ways of working do not match; divergent interests result in conflict and selfish behaviour.\n\nIn the global social innovation scene, where I find myself more and more as of the last few years, at the moment we have a really difficult, pressing problem: the state, after centuries of building public assets (from road networks to hospitals, from libraries to mass literacy), seems unable to continue to steward many such assets, and is in retreat. Can citizens come together as communities, step into the breach? And now?\n\n###Stewardship by communities\n\nThe global Edgeryders community has collected [over a hundred case studies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cov7n7xqqQbGYRqUSQxHd-3ksrBfbRUrVdYFL8lPoOg/edit#gid=0) of ordinary citizens who decide they care about some asset that belongs to everyone and benefits everyone, step forward and get to work to preserve and enhance it. Their stories are amazingly diverse, from [the pensioner running the only botanical garden in Montenegro](/t/once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-botanical-garden/3634) to the bunch of Californian hackers sitting in an abandoned McDonald's [re-engineering the technology to read the digital photos taken by the first Lunar Orbiter in 1966](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/lost-lunar-photos-recovered-by-great-feats-of-hackerdom-developed-at-a-mcdonalds/). These stories inspired us to set up [Living On The Edge 4](/en/welcome-to-lote4), a conference dedicated to citizen-led stewardship.\n\nNo point in waiting around, hoping that someone would do something about it. We don't exactly see anyone qualified to do the job. The state? In retreat. Private business? Terrible track record, just look what happened to energy utilities in Russia or railways in the UK when privatization kicked in. [b]The only option left is to rise up to the challenge ourselves. Are we qualified? No way. So, we are coming together to learn how to become better stewards, as citizens. This is really difficult, and to do it we need not only ability, but diversity. In fact we think we weed the most diverse group we can put in the field. Living On The Edge 4 is run by a team of curators the like of which the world has never seen.[/b] It includes Fabrizio Barca, former cabinet minister and presently general director at the Italian Treasury; [Caroline Paulick-Thiel](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/caroline-paulick-thiel/3a/b88/a39), German activist who spearheaded the effort to defend the pocket-sized utopia of a [Prinzessinnengarten](http://prinzessinnengarten.net/about/) in Berlin from speculation; Swede [Amelia Andersdotter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Andersdotter), the youngest MEPs in history (elected at 21!), now president of the European Pirate Party; German open source hacker [Matthias Ansorg](http://ma.juii.net/), winner of the first European social innovation competition (a man who bought a 1968 firetruck and is turning it into a fully bespoke open source mobile apartment!); [Robin Chase](http://robinchase.org/), serial entrepreneur in the sharing economy and Bostonian patrician; and [Nadia El-Imam](http://be.linkedin.com/in/nadiaelimam), Afro-Swedish engineer and entrepreneur, currently serving as Edgeryders CEO.\n\nThe job of this exceptional team is not that of leading, but rather that to help the Edgeryders community to map out the terrain of stewardship, not very well known as yet. In line with hacker tradition, the agenda of Living On The Edge 4 (and that of the hackathon preceding it) is set by the community; curators are there to connect each talk and workshop to each other, highlight similarities and differences, try to get a sense for what works and in which circumstances.\n\n###Trial and error in Matera\n\nCan senior civil servants, politicians and high-profile entrepreneurs really work side by side in relative harmony with hackers, squatters and digital nomads? We are aware of the risks of misunderstandings and even clashes, but on the whole we believe that yes, they can. Certainly we did our best to set the stage for a fruitful, rewarding interaction. First, we carefully handpicked our curators as people who are, certainly, bearers of strong cultures of their own, but are also curious of the cultures and approaches of others. Second, we did not just put them in contact with each other, but put ourselves forward as stewards of those new relationships, offering to explain to the ones what might look weird or unsettling in the behaviour of the others. And third, we chose for Living On The Edge 4 an inspiring physical environment: the [unMonastery](http://unmonastery.org/ in Matera, a place where experimentation is normal, and errors are acknowledged and accepted as part of the process, rather than frowned upon.\n\nOurs is just an experiment. It might fail, or be an extraordinary success. Whichever way it goes, we will try to learn from success or failure, to make it a milestone in the journey that leads to better methods to attack, together, the ever more urgent and global problems we face. How the journey goes depends on you, too: if you want to help Fabrizio Barca, Amelia Andersdotter and the others to get there, join the People of the Edge in Matera.\n\n<em>( Translated from the Italian and reposted from: http://www.chefuturo.it/2014/10/solo-un-patto-tra-politici-hackers-e-cittadini-puo-consentire-di-prendersi-cura-davvero-dei-beni-pubblici/ )</em>\n\n----------\n##:it: _Italian version_<a name=\"it\"></a>\n\nIl notabilato, la casta, l'\u00e9lite, l'uno per cento. In tutti i modelli di governo che funzionano alla scala nazionale, anche quelli democratici, i pochi prendono decisioni per i molti. Alcuni studiosi \u2013 me compreso \u2013 stanno cercando soluzioni per processi decisionali aperti, a cui molte persone possano partecipare attraverso processi di intelligenza collettiva; ma queste soluzioni sono molto lontane dall'essere pronte. Nel frattempo molti pensano che questo sia un prezzo inevitabile da pagare per un processo decisionale governabile. Questo crea una tensione tra i pochi che stanno nella stanza dei bottoni e i molti che ne rimangono fuori. Come scegliere i decisori in modo che portino i risultati migliori possibili?\n\n###La diversit\u00e0 vince sull'abilit\u00e0\n\nNel 2004 gli economisti Lu Hong e Scott Page hanno avuto un'idea radicalmente nuova: i gruppi che funzionano meglio nel trovare soluzioni a problemi complessi non sono quelli composti dalle persone di qualit\u00e0 migliore, ma quelli composti dalle persone pi\u00f9 diverse tra loro. [Diversity trumps ability](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/science/08conv.html), dicono: la diversit\u00e0 vince sull'abilit\u00e0.\n\nIl modello funziona cos\u00ec: immaginiamo un gruppo che affronta un problema difficile. \"Difficile\" vuol dire che non \u00e8 nemmeno chiaro che tipo di problema \u00e8, non \u00e8 facile da inquadrare. L'unico modo per fare passi avanti \u00e8 provare ad attaccarlo con varie tecniche, e sperare che qualcuna funzioni. Ciascun componente del gruppo padroneggia un numero limitato di tecniche, e ciascuna tecnica risolve bene alcuni tipi di problemi, ma non \u00e8 molto utile per altri. Un esempio concreto potrebbe essere un'automobile il cui motore non si avvia. Il problema potrebbe essere meccanico; o elettrico; o ancora nel software della centralina; o nel fatto che il serbatoio \u00e8 vuoto! Un gruppo di dieci meccanici, anche bravissimi, non saranno probabilmente in grado di fare ripartire la vostra auto se il problema \u00e8 elettrico.\n\n[quote]\nUn gruppo con competenze diversificate, invece, pu\u00f2 provare pi\u00f9 approcci al problema, e ha pi\u00f9 probabilit\u00e0 di risolverlo. Quindi, per affrontare un problema difficile, conviene costruire gruppi molto diversificati.\n[/quote]\n\nIl ragionamento fila. E allora perch\u00e9 la tendenza all'omogeneit\u00e0 culturale delle \u00e9lites politiche ed economiche? Perch\u00e9 \u00e8 cos\u00ec difficile vedere skaters nei ministeri, atlete nei consigli di amministrazione, artisti di circo ai vertici delle fondazioni bancarie? Ci sono molte ragioni per questo, ma una delle pi\u00f9 importanti \u00e8 che collaborare \u00e8 difficile quando si \u00e8 diversi. Le differenze di linguaggio ostacolano la comunicazione; gli stili di lavoro non si incontrano; gli interessi divergenti alimentano conflitti e egoismi.\n\nNell'ambiente europeo e globale dell'innovazione sociale, quello in cui mi muovo di pi\u00f9 ultimamente, in questo momento abbiamo sul tappeto un problema davvero molto difficile e urgente: lo Stato, che per un secolo e pi\u00f9 ha costruito beni pubblici (dalle strade agli ospedali, dalle biblioteche all'alfabetizzazione di massa), \u00e8 in ritirata e non riesce pi\u00f9 a prendersene cura. Possono i cittadini, riuniti in comunit\u00e0, prendersi cura insieme di quei beni materiali e immateriali che lo stato sta abbandonando? E come?\n\n###Il modello \"stewardship\"\n\nLa comunit\u00e0 globale di Edgeryders ha raccolto [oltre cento esperienze](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cov7n7xqqQbGYRqUSQxHd-3ksrBfbRUrVdYFL8lPoOg/edit#gid=0) di semplici cittadini che prendono a cuore qualcosa che \u00e8 di tutti, si fanno avanti, si rimboccano le maniche e se ne prendono cura \u2013 dal [pensionato che gestisce l'unico giardino botanico del Montenegro]() al gruppo di hackers californiani in un McDonald's abbandonato, che [ricostruiscono la tecnologia per leggere le fotografie digitali fatte dal primo Lunar Orbiter nel 1966](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/lost-lunar-photos-recovered-by-great-feats-of-hackerdom-developed-at-a-mcdonalds/). Da queste esperienze \u00e8 nata [Living On The Edge 4](), una conferenza dedicata al tema della stewardship, cio\u00e8 la custodia dei beni pubblici svolta dai cittadini (il titolo vuol dire pi\u00f9 o meno \"vita sul bordo\"). L'obiettivo \u00e8 imparare tutti insieme come diventare custodi migliori, facendo leva sui successi ottenuti e imparando dagli errori fatti lungo il percorso. E siccome il problema \u00e8 davvero difficile, abbiamo bisogno del massimo di diversit\u00e0 che possiamo mettere in campo.\n\nLiving On The Edge 4 \u00e8 gestito da un team di curatori come non si \u00e8 mai visto: comprende Fabrizio Barca, ex ministro e direttore generale del Ministero dell'economia; [Caroline Paulick-Thiel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-paulick-thiel), attivista tedesca in prima fila nel difendere l'utopia tascabile di [Prinzessinnengarten a Berlino](http://prinzessinnengarten.net/about/) dalla speculazione edilizia; la svedese [Amelia Andersdotter]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Andersdotter), la pi\u00f9 giovane europarlamentare di tutti i tempi (eletta a 21 anni!) e attualmente presidente del partito pirata europeo; il tedesco [Matthias Ansorg](https://ma.juii.net), hacker open sourcevincitore del premio europeo per l'innovazione sociale, uno che ha comprato un autopompa del 1968 e lo sta riattando per farne una casa mobile completamente autocostruita; l'americana [Robin Chase](http://www.robinchase.org), imprenditrice seriale della sharing economy; e l'altra svedese [Nadia El-Imam](https://be.linkedin.com/in/nadiaelimam), CEO di Edgeryders. Il ruolo di questa squadra eccezionale non \u00e8 per\u00f2 quello di dare la linea, ma piuttosto quello di aiutare la comunit\u00e0 di Edgeryders a mappare il terreno della stewardship, ancora poco conosciuto. In piena tradizione hacker, gli interventi alla conferenza (e all'hackathon che la procede) sono proposti dalla comunit\u00e0 stessa; i curatori hanno il compito di collegare tra loro i vari interventi, sottolineando somiglianze e differenze, cercando di capire cosa funziona e in quali situazioni.\n\n###Da Matera la via italiana\n\nDavvero dirigenti pubblici, figure politiche e imprenditori di successo possono lavorare fianco a fianco con hackers, squatters e nomadi digitali? Siamo consapevoli dei rischi di incomprensioni e perfino di scontri, ma crediamo di s\u00ec. Certamente abbiamo fatto del nostro meglio per preparare il terreno: per prima cosa coinvolgendo persone certamente portatrici di una propria cultura ma anche curiose di quelle degli altri; evidenziando i tratti comuni tra le loro esperienze; e presidiando l'interazione, in modo da ridurre i rischi di equivoci e delusioni. Anche l'ambiente in cui si svolge tutto questo aiuta: si tratta dell'[unMonastery](http://unmonastery.org) di Matera, un luogo dove la sperimentazione \u00e8 all'ordine del giorno e gli errori commessi vengono accettati come parte del processo, invece che disapprovati.\n\n\u00c8 solo un esperimento. Potrebbe fallire. Potrebbe essere uno straordinario successo. Comunque vada, cercheremo di imparare dal successo o dal fallimento, di renderlo una tappa del viaggio che porta a metodi migliori per affrontare, insieme, i problemi sempre pi\u00f9 pressanti e sempre pi\u00f9 globali che ci attendono. E come andr\u00e0 dipende anche da te: se vuoi provare a vincere questa scommessa insieme a Fabrizio Barca, Amelia Andersdotter e gli altri, raggiungi il Popolo del Bordo a Matera.\n\n(Ripostato da: http://www.chefuturo.it/?p=37806)", "created_at": "2014-10-28 17:19:10", "updated_at": "2018-04-01 15:20:15.718698", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2461, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 26.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [104, 8, 5, 2377], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11025, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1267, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>I don't like flirting :)</b>\n\nThank you so much Lyne!

My doubts are in the following areas:\n\n<em>The ultimate goal for networking is to bridge online reality to real life relationships. - </em>I want to take it slowly precisely because I care a lot about real life relationships and have a hard time understanding how it works in the online environment. It does take up a lot of time, and I'm not sure I want to pursue this actively just for the sake of building networks. Even paying attention takes a lot of time, and sometimes I'd rather do just that : sit and watch, and filter. As with time management, work, and making friends, being selective is very important to me. Otherwise I'd get lost on the way, and risk being superficial.\u00a0\n\n<em>To get attention on social media, show that you have something of value to share</em>. - Until one has smth to share, I think it's better to just learn, study, read. and I have a long way to go.\n\nSumming up,<strong> LinkedIn seems a good way to start, less blogging for now until I have something to say.\n\nAnd having a mentor, wow</strong>.

J'ai d\u00e9couvert un monde aux nombreux visages et aux nombreuses opportunit\u00e9s. J'ai donc choisi de concentrer mes recherches dans ce domaine particulier. Le m\u00e9tier du conseil est un monde assez vaste. Il recoupe de nombreuses prestations aussi bien le conseil en management (leadership, gestion d'\u00e9quipe, gestion de projet), le conseil en informatique (conseils techniques en s\u00e9curit\u00e9, en technologies, en m\u00e9thodologie), du conseil financier (optimiser la tr\u00e9sorerie et les investissements). Pour ma part, il s'agit principalement de conseil en management.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJ'interviens principalement dans le cadre de d\u00e9ploiement de logiciels dans des administrations ou des entreprises priv\u00e9es. Mon role consiste \u00e0 assurer le plan de communication et la communication (vid\u00e9o, e-mail, brochures) ainsi que la formation des utilisateurs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCette partie de formation est la plus importante et celle qui pr\u00e9sente le plus de challenges. En effet, il s'agit tout d'abord de bien conna\u00eetre l'environnement professionnel des utilisateurs, leur organisation du travail (en r\u00e9seau ou travail divis\u00e9 par t\u00e2ches). Il faut \u00e9galement rencontrer les acteurs pour comprendre leurs craintes, leurs attentes, leurs besoins. La formation doit alors tout autant apporter des paroles rassurantes et optimistes tout autant que les former aux outils. Il s'agit d'une remise en cause quotidienne pour se mettre \u00e0 leur place et obtenir leur adh\u00e9sion au projet sans \u00e9vacuer leurs craintes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nD'autres personnes de ma soci\u00e9t\u00e9 interviennent en amont pour cadrer les besoins des clients avec les technologies du march\u00e9, r\u00e9alisent un \"benchmark\" des solutions du march\u00e9, organisent des ateliers utilisateurs.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLes qualit\u00e9s requises sont l'\u00e9coute, la patience, la p\u00e9dagogie, l'adaptabilit\u00e9 (face \u00e0 des contextes parfois compliqu\u00e9s). Pas besoin d'expertises particuli\u00e8res dans la mesure o\u00f9 nous nous formons avant de donner les formations. Toutefois, si cette expertise correspond \u00e0 une passion particuli\u00e8re (comme les intranets et r\u00e9seaux sociaux d'entrerpise pour moi), c'est un plus car elle procure une motivation suppl\u00e9mentaire et un engagement particulier.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLe changement, en fait, c'est un peu d'outils mais beaucoup d'humain.

La personne, qui habituellement n'entend rien de ce que je dis, m'a demand\u00e9 avec inqui\u00e9tude si j'\u00e9tais malade. J'ai r\u00e9pondu: 'Je vais parfaitement bien. Je suis seulement heureuse'. Cela a tellement boulevers\u00e9 cette personne qu'elle n'a cess\u00e9 d'y repenser pendant plusieurs jours, contente, et soulag\u00e9e d'apprendre que ces choses-l\u00e0 existent. Habituellement enferm\u00e9e dans un oc\u00e9an de superficialit\u00e9, on aurait dit que ma br\u00e8ve r\u00e9ponse a eu l'effet d'un baume.\n\nIl m'arrive plus souvent qu'autrement de me sentir inutile. Mais lorsque j'observe l'impact prodigieux qu'un peu d'information peut avoir sur le parcours de certaines gens, cela me r\u00e9conforte. Mon secret, que j'ai gard\u00e9 sous cl\u00e9 pendant 2 ans, je trouve de plus en plus le courage de le r\u00e9v\u00e9ler. J'ai encore peur de raconter mes histoires. Mais lorsque je parviens \u00e0 trouver le moment opportun, il se produit des choses extraordinaires. Cette visite inattendue m'encourage \u00e0 penser que d'autre moments opportuns se pr\u00e9senteront pour moi et pour d'autres personnes \u00e9galement, et que nous progressons vers une humanit\u00e9 plus \u00e9volu\u00e9e.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-21 16:09:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:02.314630", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 512, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10886, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4070, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Space for everyone</b>\n\nBen, the concept note is an evolution of <a href=\"/t/collective-awareness-platforms-for-sustainability-and-social-innovation-a-horizon-2020-call-with-a-good-fit-to-edgeryders-community-interests/3989\">this</a>, posted publicly about a month ago. It targets a programme called CAPS, centered not on health, but on collective intelligence. Edgeryders is possibly a good match for it, given platform, OpenEthnographer, Edgesense etc. etc. This programme wants (1) research (2) on methods (and maybe tech) to elicit, gather and process individual contribution into collective intelligence, whatever that is. Care is a \"case study\"; it makes obvious sense because it is an interesting issue, and many people are passionate about it, but in the end your delivery for CAPS is a method, instantiated. \u00a0I speak as a minor co-author of a successful last-round CAPS proposal (<a href=\"http://catalyst-fp7.eu\">this</a>); that project was 70 pages of collective intelligence literature survey, added value of the proposed approach, and all the bells and whistles. The heavy lifting was done by a guy who works at MIT's Collective Intelligence Lab. It's academia, computer science department.\n\nA project about rethinking health care in a decentralized way (without a \"big guns\" academic approach) is not going to make the cut for CAPS, so it's unlikely that whatever you are cooking in the UK enters in zero-sum competition with a CAPS project. On the contrary, it might be advantageous to have loosely coupled projects in the field: projects can share human resources, coordinate to achieve critical mass at events etc. It may also be a form of risk management. Suppose, for example, you have an org that can perform well on both a CAPS-style project and a more production-oriented social innovation style/NESTA Public Service Lab style project: that org can both join the CAPS consortium (assuming we can put it together) AND apply for production-oriented funding elsewhere.\n\nAlso, the issue is out there, it is big and interesting, and very many smart people are looking at it. This is not to say your own research contribution is not important or novel, but people have been working on it for years now, and they are not letting it go. NESTA interviewed me for a job directing a project called People Powered Health in 2011; when we went to Milano a couple of weeks ago we met a visually impaired guy working away in <a href=\"/u/costantino\">Costantino</a>'s makerspace at building personalized aids for himself. The national health service is quite liberal when it comes to buying products (white canes etc.), but all such products are proprietary. He cannot get components and help to make his own aids \u2013 unless with his own money, and maybe even breaking safety regulations. Costantino is intrigued, and Costantino means also Arduino etc. You get the idea: it is likely that people we don't even know are negotiating projects in this space with <em>all</em> major funding agencies. Good luck trying to ringfence it.\n\nAnd finally, the reason why we posted that thing well ahead of time and in a part of the website visible to all is exactly to throw the doors wide open to anybody who wants to be part of it. Do you have something you would like to do? A partner you would like to work with? Just step forward, like others have done: all options are being considered at the moment.\u00a0And notice that, as of now, ER LBG is (as usual) doing the homework to give everyone access: researching the call, attending the CAPS Infoday on December 16th to get a better sense of what that crowd is about, calling universities and what have you. We use community reflections as a source of inspiration, but then we give back in the form of an open invitation. For full transparency: no decision has been made yet. We are in preliminary discussion with the Design department of Politecnico di Milano, notably <a href=\"/u/stefano_maffei\">Stefano Maffei</a>. The idea is to ask his mentor <a href=\"http://www.sigeneration.ca/ezio-manzini/\">Ezio Manzini</a>, the dean of service design and a very cool guy, to be the scientific coordinator (but he may refuse). We will be talking to SCIMpulse Foundation too \u2013 I have been wanting to work with Marco for a while now, if this does not work we will do something else. If we fail to find or build a solid partnership, with at least two top-notch universities, we will not apply. Edgeryders can only be a minor partner in a CAPS project.\n\nOk, this takes care of the case in question. Then there are a few loose ends in the background; I'd like to discuss them with you. How about a call next week? Tentative agenda:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Appropriation of research material is a pretty serious allegation. I don't see it (in fact, I was not even aware you have written research material). In her note, Nadia references a LOTE4 session and the session documentation, proposed by Remy, which you and I and others attended. It should be OK for anyone in the Edgeryders community to reference LOTE sessions; do you find this reasonable? Or are we having a rerun of the discussion on openness \u2013 speaking of unacknowledged <a href=\"/t/unmonastery-t-shirts-fleeces-hoodies-as-a-gift-to-volunteers/3706/28\">comments</a>?</li>\n\n<li>The LOTE4 budget was discussed with you \u2013 as per your suggestion, we beefed up Lauren's grant to acknowledge the work she did in Istanbul and elsewhere. A month ago we published <a href=\"/t/fully-unpacking-lote4-organisation-processes-key-roles-budget-and-outcomes/3982\">the wrapup</a>, including the numbers. No one made any observations. Did we do anything wrong? Is there some loose end to pick up? We can still do it, of course.</li>\n\n<li>Case Study Adventures for me boils down to this: we observe that some people (Natalia and Lauren come to mind) want to lead adventurous lives. So we look for clients and projects that would pay them to do so. Doing this is the very reason Edgeryders exists! I get very confused by you, of all people, casting it in a negative light, especially seen as we do not prevent anyone from doing the same. On the contrary, we would only be happy if more people did it. Or do you object not to the thing itself, but to being called with a name that you invented? Or what, in general, would you like to happen?</li>\n\n<li>I am not aware of anything going on with Annemarie, even at the idea stage \u2013 but then our <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-lbg-projects-dashboard/3998\">projects dashboard</a> is still young, and maybe it slipped through the radar. Would you like to explain what exactly you are being cut out of?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-02 02:07:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:02.808133", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1176, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7185], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23785, "user_id": 95, "topic_id": 1144, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Thanks\u00a0\n\nNadia...

The kid with the first -imagined- answer questions if it is actually good or desirable to have more and more of something. For a generation (the generation of Mr. Zimbardo and his fellows) that had lived all their lives believing that scarcity is bad and abundance is good, it is inconceivable, that a future generation would rather have it on the contrary. It also does not take into account the quality of growth. A growth in marshmallows? (or war supplies, or toxic plastics or nuclear power stations, etc) No, thanks! Two fresh yummy apples instead of one? Yes, please!\n\nThe second kid is then doing what bankers have stopped doing and what then led to the subprime crisis: He wanted to know about the past behavior of someone he was supposed to trust (give credit). Had the guy at the counter always payed his bills on time? Has he always had a steady job or a steady income? Has he got some savings or is he what they call a NINA- no income no assets - person.\n\nThe bankers at some point started to shun these principles. They would go like: What do we know? If a person did not pay his bills in the past it doesn't mean he will do so in the future. Everything is changing, people have no steady jobs, they have a job today, no job tomorrow, and in a week from now they can win the lottery. Everybody has a right to change and the only thing that matters to us is that he's a client who lives up to his obligations.\u00a0\n\nWhat happened actually was something very \"American\", I would say. The past did not matter anymore, only the future. What these people failed (and still fail)\u00a0 to see is that there is no future without the past. Only the past can show us the behavior of a curve and then we can - more or less accurately - predict where it will go from now. Stock exchange traders are constantly looking at those curves, don't they?\n\nWhat brings me to your example, Nadia. 10.000 years is a period of time that nobody dares (or cares) to think about, unless ...\n\nYes, unless you are in charge of dumping nuclear waste somewhere. It's funny, because I am from a place where this is going to happen now. Salzgitter, Germany has an abandoned Iron ore mine that is now going to be used as a repository - here's a link to the official state propaganda site that says how safe it all is:\n\nhttp://www.endlager-konrad.de/cln_005/nn_1560/EN/1__Endlager/__node.html?__nnn=true\n\nWhen they started even considering this \"endlager\" (sounds like endloesung, doesn't it?) in 1982, I was already participating in the first -mostly violent- protests and now, 32 years later, they have won all the legal battles, and they will implement it. So, there is a notion of my own present: 32 years is a long time in my life. And then there is the mind-boggling idea, like, the next 10.000 years, there will be toxic, radioactive waste right underneath the place where I was born and where I grew up with family and friends.\n\nOf course they say that everything is safe for the next 10.000 years. And here you can see the flaws of supposedly scientific / responsible / official assumptions at its purest.\n\nAuthority , those in power - will always tell you that the sun circles around the earth, and that you have to postpone gratification to be successful or that radioactive waste is safe for the next 10.000 years in Salzgitter. Yes, these things are related.\n\nHere's something I found the other day and it deals with time, trauma, gaming and narratives. Anyone interested?\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/magazine/twine-the-video-game-technology-for-all.html?_r=0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-22 16:29:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:12.386708", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 717, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 923, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 890, "post_number": 1, "raw": "A group of people working together for some time now met in person (some for the first time) for an intensive Edgeryders workshop in Strasbourg. Different backgrounds and life worlds meet and guess what: good sparks come out. Imagine a smart conversation between Gilda, personalizing Edgeryders\u2019 institutional end, Vinay, a world guru of resilience, Nadia, our charismatic creative director, Lyne the idealistic opengov advocate, network builder Alberto MZ, computer scientist-game-passionate Ivan and Alberto, skilled navigator between institutional and ground realities.\n\n<a href=\"/sites/edgeryders.eu/files/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Edgeryders-workshop.png\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/769b7c309eedd35b5bde42500ff9ea4532cccc85.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"375\">\n\n</a>\n\nWe reviewed Edgeryders purpose and vision and we found out that working in such a complex project requires us to be able to reflect continuously on its goals, on how we present it so that it reasonates with European institutions' goals, with policy makers agendas, with civil society interested in youth, and particularly with individuals..\u00a0 Gilda spoke about the role that bottom up approaches in participation can have in rebuilding bridges between institutions and moving towards WE governments. She thinks it\u2019s crucial nowadays to transform people\u2019s expression and language into political advice.\n\nI understood, thanks to Nadia, that whereas for some Edgeryders one-on-one interaction has an inherent value and also translates naturally into mechanisms of policy making, others need to feel they understand these mechanisms in order to connect Edgeryders conversation with output. So some of us think it's important to clarify\u00a0 how Edgeryders can shine light in the opaque space that's covering institutions at the moment. My question to you Edgeryders would be: to what extent you're here because you feel it's useful for you personally? as (not necessarily) opposed to: you're here because you want to see a real change coming through policy?\n\n<strong>A new role for institutions?</strong> We reached a consensus on this topic: institutions need to reform so that they can learn to listen and transform output and voice such as Edgeryders' into concrete action. Our project is an experimental approach, mainly because of matching massive use of internet enabled collaboration with existing institutional frameworks, but also because it says no to top-down approaches of youth in transition, no to speaking of youth in 3rd person, no to use of stigmatizing labels (NEETS or \"lost generation\"), no to use of prior data in policy without confronting it with ground reality. We believe in the existence of a community that engages in a respectful information exchange with institutions, is willing to listen and be listened. We also found a new metaphor for Edgeryders (thanks Vinay :)) - a <strong>fishing rod</strong>, because it brings together the strength of\u00a0 governments (the reel) and the creativity of individuals (through angling). And so this means we're creating a space where legitimacy and true potential meet.

Not that it changes much: even if civilization is not about to implode, we still have plenty of big, scary problems to fix. And even if it is, our reach is still very, very limited. Sometimes, in the darkest moments, one thinks it gets about as far as talking about it at conferences and various events.\n\nGrassroots swell is, I think, achievable. Many people yearn for story and adventure and the good fight. But once they are mobilized, then what? Many grow impatient with inaction and impotence. If you sound the call, and the people come, you'd better have something meaningful for them to do!\n\nSo, we try to find channels that smell right. Epic, but small and achievable.

They participate in the City of Matera open data contest and win two out of the four prizes: they refuse to touch the cash prizes, and instead ask the city to use it to organize a development sprint to extend the work onto more cities in Puglia and Basilicata (the company serving Matera, Miccolis, also serves 15 more cities; part of the software written for Matera can be reused).\n\nI am not sure how mainstream this is \u2013 after all, it does involve selfless, moneyless geeks vs. incredibly untransparent public transport companies. But even assuming it can be called completely mainstream, hey \u2013 it is something that was <em>done</em>. Some thing was not there, then somebody went out and built it, and now it is. This is, I find, inspiring and hopeful. Mobilizations without outcomes that the mobilized can be proud of is at risk of slowly poisoning the idea of mobilization itself: <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2014/12/15/striking-in-the-2010s-and-the-sadness-of-it-all/\">it happened already</a> out there in the realm of old-style political and union struggles.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-16 23:12:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:55.788168", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 451, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19093, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4417, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>UNDP</b>\n\n@Alberto <a href=\"/u/elami5\">@ElaMi5</a> perhaps UNDP has an idea, or existing channels to propagate this through?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-19 09:14:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.479527", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 24, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19061], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1329, "user_id": 433, "topic_id": 1296, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\nLos \u00faltimos treinta a\u00f1os han sido, muy posiblemente, los mejores de la historia de Espa\u00f1a. Esta es una opini\u00f3n compartida por m\u00e1s del 70% de la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica de nuestro pa\u00eds. Este tiempo se ha caracterizado por un feliz suceso: la libertad pol\u00edtica y econ\u00f3mica disfrutada durante el mismo ha sido, posiblemente, la mayor de toda nuestra historia.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSin embargo, parece que esta \u00e9poca de bondades econ\u00f3micas y sociales ha llegado repentinamente a su fin. En el \u00e1mbito econ\u00f3mico estamos instalados en una crisis de proporciones tales que no terminamos de ver ni su alcance ni su profundidad. En el \u00e1mbito pol\u00edtico, la libertad comienza a padecer serias limitaciones e incluso retrocesos como consecuencia de la creciente invasi\u00f3n del poder pol\u00edtico en la esfera individual, observ\u00e1ndose adem\u00e1s un desapego creciente entre la ciudadan\u00eda y las instituciones p\u00fablicas.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMuchas personas han perdido las esperanzas de que haya cambios constructivos, a pesar de que tenemos las herramientas que nos brindan los medios sociales para difundir las ideas, superar el aislamiento y movilizar a millones en favor de la reforma y la renovaci\u00f3n.\u00a0Como acertadamente comentaba Daniel Innerarity en un art\u00edculo reciente \u201c<em>en una Sociedad del Conocimiento los Estados ya no tienen enfrente a una masa informe de inexpertos, sino a una inteligencia distribuida, una ciudadan\u00eda m\u00e1s exigente y una humanidad observadora, de la que forma parte un gran n\u00famero de organismos internacionales que no solamente les eval\u00faan, sino que disponen frecuentemente de m\u00e1s y mejor saber experto que los Estados.\u201d</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo reconducir esta situaci\u00f3n? La respuesta es muy complicada, tiene muchas aristas, y no hay una respuesta \u00fanica. Empecemos, pues, por cambiar las cosas, una por una: nuestra mentalidad, nuestra forma de hacer las cosas, nuestra forma de ver la econom\u00eda, nuestra forma de entender esta realidad que nos reta. Creo que aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 el quid de la cuesti\u00f3n, en <strong>el poder transformador de la tecnolog\u00eda</strong>. La tecnolog\u00eda aplicada a los sectores tradicionales de la econom\u00eda productiva, la tecnolog\u00eda aplicada a la educaci\u00f3n, a la sanidad, y tambi\u00e9n la tecnolog\u00eda aplicada al gobierno, a las instituciones p\u00fablicas, y a la forma en que ciudadanos y empresas nos relacionamos con todos ellos. <strong>Esta es, para m\u00ed, la respuesta y el punto de inflexi\u00f3n.</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\nVivimos en la Era de la Informaci\u00f3n, donde los datos ocupan un lugar prominente. Vivimos conectados. Generamos y almacenamos m\u00e1s datos que nunca antes en la Historia, y se estima que este crecimiento continuar\u00e1 su ritmo imparable de forma exponencial. Seg\u00fan el informe de la Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica acerca del estado de la Sociedad de la Informaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a en 2011, el 67,1% de los espa\u00f1oles son internautas; el 71,4% acceden a diario a la Red, e Internet ya supone el 2,2% del PIB en Espa\u00f1a con un 75% de impacto en los sectores tradicionales de la econom\u00eda. La adopci\u00f3n de las tecnolog\u00edas (sociales, m\u00f3viles, cloud) nos est\u00e1n permitiendo irrumpir all\u00ed donde antes no nos era posible.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLos gobiernos y las administraciones p\u00fablicas no escapan a esta realidad. Empezando desde la e-administraci\u00f3n, el 92% de los procedimientos para los ciudadanos con la Administraci\u00f3n General del Estado ya se pueden tramitar de forma electr\u00f3nica, el 82% para las empresas, ahorrando m\u00e1s de 3000 millones de euros al a\u00f1o. <strong>\u00bfQu\u00e9 m\u00e1s pueden hacer las Administraciones P\u00fablicas puedan seguir siendo una fuente de ahorros y de generaci\u00f3n de riqueza, y adem\u00e1s, que acorte distancias entre ciudadanos e instituciones? </strong>\n\nDe nuevo, la respuesta no es \u00fanica, pero una de las maneras debe ser liberando y publicando los datos que se hallan en poder de las instituciones p\u00fablicas utilizando formatos digitales, estandarizados y abiertos, de manera que sigan una estructura clara que permita su comprensi\u00f3n y que fomente su reutilizaci\u00f3n para cualquier uso tanto para empresas como ciudadanos.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEsto es el <strong>OpenData o Datos Abiertos, </strong>el combustible de esta Nueva Era de la Informaci\u00f3n que tiene el poder de dar a la sociedad un nuevo motor econ\u00f3mico y una nueva y activa forma de relaci\u00f3n con los gobiernos. Esto es lo que venimos denominando como <strong>Open Government</strong>, el Gobierno Abierto que permite como nunca hasta ahora que podamos participar en la gesti\u00f3n de los asuntos p\u00fablicos y, de una parte, tener un mayor conocimiento, informaci\u00f3n y control sobre las actuaciones de los pol\u00edticos y gestores p\u00fablicos y de otra, intervenir, colaborar y participar en dicha gesti\u00f3n, recuperando as\u00ed la proximidad entre la gesti\u00f3n p\u00fablica y los ciudadanos.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCon este \u00e1nimo y esta visi\u00f3n creamos en 2011 el <strong>portal de datos abiertos del Gobierno de Castilla-La Mancha, </strong><a href=\"http://opendata.jccm.es/\"><strong>http://opendata.jccm.es</strong></a> Nuestro objetivo era potenciar la innovaci\u00f3n, la creatividad y la generaci\u00f3n de servicios de valor a\u00f1adido. D\u00e1bamos as\u00ed el primer paso en el camino para acercar a cada ciudadano y a cada empresa de Castilla-La Mancha los datos p\u00fablicos que configuran nuestra regi\u00f3n. Nos abr\u00edamos a la opini\u00f3n de nuestros conciudadanos, para que nos ayudaran a mejorar, para centrar nuestros esfuerzos, para que nos dijeran qu\u00e9 datos necesitaban o qu\u00e9 servicios o aplicaciones les eran de inter\u00e9s.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEste fue el primer paso de un largo camino a recorrer. Los ciudadanos deber\u00edan reclamar estos cambios y los gobiernos deber\u00edan ser permeables a esta demanda y cambiar legislaciones y forma de trabajo que se antojan anacr\u00f3nicas. Esta revoluci\u00f3n de los datos, la conectividad y la tecnolog\u00eda puede llevarnos a una sociedad con una forma de relaci\u00f3n mucho m\u00e1s transparente y participativa, que al mismo tiempo favorezca el surgimiento de nuevas empresas que transformen la econom\u00eda y que hagan aflorar nuevas industrias, y que haga reverdecer la confianza en las instituciones p\u00fablicas. \u00bfImposible? \u00bfUtop\u00eda? No. S\u00f3lo hay que ir paso a paso.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-26 17:17:01", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 08:21:04.222439", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1104, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 45.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12624, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 4579, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>oh</b>\n\nand I also got an interview planned with <a href=\"/u/boris\">@Boris</a>\u00a0of crowdfunding organization <a href=\"http://wehelp.ge/\">WeHelp</a>.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-26 14:59:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:11.830796", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11836], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14385, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 6388, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Try it and see</b>\n\nwhat happens..!\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-18 15:22:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:21.260000", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2946, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2913, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>Present in the call: </strong><a href=\"/u/asimong\">@Simon Grant</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/hazem\">@Hazem</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/dorotea\">@Dorotea</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/mariabyck\">@mariabyck</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/kei\">@Kei</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/micha\">@Micha</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a>\u00a0with cameo appearances from <a href=\"/u/elf_pavlik\">@elf Pavlik</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/auli\">@Auli</a>\u00a0:)\n\n<strong>[Calls for p2p support!]</strong>\n\n<span>Know of Italian foundations to present the unMonastery to for fundraising?

With mappuing the commons, we're working with 2-3 storytelling spaces. We keep getting asked what the pthers are doing, when they could just speak with one another. One of the key functions is facilitator, network weaver and communication. There might be a certain amount of competition between them, isntead of seeing one seeing each other as a resource.

This general question as I perceive it was <em>\"how to make a collaborative project/process welcoming in practical and realistic terms\" . </em>\n\n(There are more aspects of the questions asked, but I'll refer to this aspect here)\n\nI think it's a good thing that we can learn together and improve our projects based on gained shared knowledge.\n\nWe can learn in neutral objective ways, even if sometimes we might have more emotionally involved views on some projects . <em>( But it's completely OK to feel emotional about things too . )</em>\n\nIt's possible that most conversations around the topic of unMonastery, even as an example, are in some way emotionally charged, especially for everyone involved in a project since the beginning, but we can still try to look at it from a different perspective and answer the questions objectively. \n\n \n\nI believe this post might have been actually more neutral <strong>in the questions asked</strong> that it might seem, and referred to the conversation me and Nadia had about <strong>what makes a collaborative process/project welcoming</strong> ( in the context of this wiki https://edgeryders.eu/en/manual-for-healthy-communities/healthy-communication-culture-how-it and the project I proposed to start working on, learning together <em>on many examples </em>. \n\nI've been working on this topic for a while now, and I'm happy to help. Just because I genuinely care :)\n\nOne of the important ingredients of the answer is welcoming human interactions and communication. How can I join the project (in practical, realistic terms)? What happens when I have some concerns? How can I join the conversation ? How can I collaborate constructively and enjoyably ? etc...\n\n \n\nAs an <em>example ( neutral example, really :)</em> in the context of unMonastery, how can I support and help ? how can someone participate in building the project together (not just apply)? <strong>what are possible collaborative processes to co-design that makes a project of this type welcoming ? </strong>\n\nI'm interested in finding the answers to these questions so that it can improve <strong>any collaborative process and project. </strong>\n\nI think that many people who might care about the project like unMonastery (containing the co-living feature) can possibly have some reasons constraining the option to be at the specific time in the specific location ( in the co-living context or event context, the same applies to the edgeryders projects and events, like Lote events, Futurespotters, etc ) but still would like to be involved and included in a participative way. How can people \"keep in touch\" but not just via social media or a newsletter type of updates, but rather as a collaborative conversation ? \n\nAnother practical matter to consider is that people have very different skills to support the projects with.

Reading about you brings up enthusiasm and energy and this usually means for me we're a good match.\n\nI'm an ambassador for social change.\u00a0\n\nI am passionate about developing myself as a human being, understanding more about how I work on a psichological level and thus become more empathic with those around me. I have a huge apetite for observing and analizing and challenging my beliefs, patterns and inner structures (that includes the outer ones as well) and I admire people that do the same.\u00a0\n\nI am passionate about artistic an creative ways to communicate about new ways of living and seeing the world. I believe that change that change that happens only in our mind but not in our hearts and our body (through experience) does not sustain. For me, art is a way to touch people in a way that any rational thought can never do.\n\nI am passionate about tools and methods that foster collaboration since I believe that this is one of the biggest challenges of our time - to (really) learn to work together.\u00a0We are called to develop alternative solutions for addressing old problems, and to assume a new perspective that honors our individual needs while addressing the urgency for more integrated and interdependent human organization. I'm interested in ways to\u00a0tap into collective intelligence in order for us to make more conscious and effective decisions together in a way that facilitates co-creativity, fosters transparency and guarantees the equivalence.\u00a0This is also one of the biggest challenges I meet again and again in my work and one of the solutions I\u00b4ve found that addresses the topic of governance and decision making is Sociocracy 3.0.\n\nI am passionate about people and projects that are a living example that a better world is possible. I know from my own experience that reading, hearing and especially meeting people that are bringing positive change in their communities brings a lot of inspiration and hope and creates the premises for future collaboration- this is for me the biggest contribution EdgeRyders brings in the community. \u00a0\n\nI would approach for an interview or to invite at the event in July:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.jamespriest.org/\">James Priest</a> (consultant, facilitator and trainer specialising in holistic organisational development, distributed leadership implementation, and complex systems optimization), <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=11636484&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=qA8o&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2Cidx%3A1-2-2%2CtarId%3A1431507159176%2Ctas%3Aclaud\">Claudian Dobos</a> (president of ECOLISE - European Network of Community-Led Initiatives on Climate Change and Sustainability, a coalition of organisations engaged in promoting and supporting local communities across Europe in their efforts to build pathways to a sustainable future), <a href=\"http://side-ways.net/episode1_en/\">Pavlik Elf</a>\u00a0(hacker, living strictly money-less and stateless since 5 years)Adela and Dan from <a href=\"https://permanentacasa.wordpress.com/\">Casa de Cultura Permanenta</a>, Cluj (o cas\u0103 deschis\u0103 creativit\u0103\u0163ii bazate pe economia darului, simplitate voluntar\u0103, spirit de comunitate \u015fi permacultur\u0103).

Of course, I need to point out that it is just a proposal, and it might very well be rejected.\u00a0</em>\n\nSaint Benedict of Nursia, an Italian monk active in the 6th century, transformed the widespread aspiration to a simple and fulfilling life into a hugely important global monastic movement, that built critical infrastructure all over the known world (inns to host travelers; herbal gardens as biodiversity reservoirs; libraries to preserve knowledge and scriptoria to back it up). Thanks to a massively redundant backup system, monks arguably saved Western civilization from the Dark Ages \u2013 they had sent copies of the most important manuscripts all the way to Ireland, outside the reach of the barbarian invasion and their fires. Additionally, they built a system with incredible long-term stability: the Benedictine movement is still alive and well, fifteen centuries later. All this was achieved without central command and without a formal overarching organisation: the Benedictines are not an order, but a federation of sovereign monasteries made interoperable by the fact that they all run on the Rule.\n\nWe argue this was possible thanks to the Rule, a document that prescribes rules of interaction for monks to live together in a monastery \u201cin relative peace, for a long time\u201d. The Rule does not set goals for monasteries (for example, it does not say \u201cgo build a library\u201d). <em>The macro-level behavior of the monastic movement is emergent</em>. What the Rule does is set rules of interaction for people who wish to live together in a monastery to live out their faith. In other words, <em>the Rule is protocol software</em> for humans. It is also open-and-free, and was forked many times over history, sometimes giving rise to long-term successful forks (like the Camaldolese or the Cistercians). We propose that you can design human-level interaction (individual monks in this case) so that the macro-level behaviour of the resulting human system (monasteries and orders in this case), while still being emergent, encodes the values that inspired. In this vision, Benedict is like a programmer who programmed monasticism to do good things for the glory of God, while still leaving <em>which</em>\u00a0good things monk would do free to emerge: in the Middle Ages that meant building libraries, in the near future it might have to do with manning slower-than-light interstellar travel (a similar case is made in the fictional work <em>Anathem</em> by Neal Stephenson). To borrow the beautiful expression invented by Doyne Farmer, monasticism as a societal dynamic system was neither periodic nor chaotic, but hovering at the edge of chaos.\n\nWe consider the advantage of systems running on protocols analogous to the Rule over other protocols, and propose a method for designing and testing possible protocols, based on computational biology and network science. Finally, we propose a preliminary version of Protocol, a modern equivalent of the Rule that has no particular God but is still meant to achieve common good.\n\nThe talk makes some reference to medieval history, complex systems science and computational biology, but no prior knowledge of any of this is required.\n\nThe ideas presented in the talk have been explored in the course of the past two years, both in theory and (to a small extent) in practice, in the course of the <a href=\"http://unmonastery.org/\">unMonastery</a> prototype in Matera, Italy.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-09-23 19:01:04", "updated_at": "2017-08-09 00:02:06.057385", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 761, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 20.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29782, "user_id": 2694, "topic_id": 4837, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>YES THANK YOU</b>\n\nTaking a look now\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-22 11:11:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:43.919283", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29716], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29784, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5981, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>Shared calendar =&gt; win</b>\n\nMaybe make it open, so that people can add themselves to it?\n\nBUT: please, do not just go out and make something.

As one of three kids Fabian* grew\u00a0up in a endearing family, which gives\u00a0him on one side as much personal and special support and on the other side treat him like his two older brothers.\u00a0\n\nFabian\u00a0lost half of his brain function after having a stroke, which lead to spastic hemiparalysis.\u00a0Because of that further problems came up like a malposition of his hips and a curvature of the spine.\n\nWhen I met him he was full of power, running around, shaking everybodys hand and laughing. But most of the time he should sit in his wheelchair, in order to guard against swollen and painful knees. Because of a cognitive limitation Fabian\u00a0is receiving all the stimuli. As we can focus on one thing and block our environment out, Fabian\u00a0can not filter environmental information. That makes him most of the time an observer, someone who is rather watching\u00a0than being in the focus of interest. Since one year his parents noticed\u00a0an aggressivity against himself, because he starts to reflect on himself, his position and possibilties. A psychologyst told them that often kids with disabilities that are more supported are more reflecting themselves and know\u00a0what limitations they have compared to\u00a0kids that are not getting that well supported.\u00a0\n\nGetting that special and individual support is really important for them, that's why the parents decided to send Fabian\u00a0to a school for physically handicapped kids.\u00a0There they will have a class with about eight kids, one teacher and one pedagog. Trained assistants with different specializations\u00a0like physiotherapist, care worker or ergotherapist are working in the school as well. Peter\u00a0said that inclusion or integration is the actual content and sounds good,\u00a0but it does not always work, as we can see in Fabians\u00a0case.\n\nAnd that individuality makes it even difficult on playgrounds to build it barrierfree.\u00a0\n\nFor Fabian, who can walk and run but not grab, force or push with his one arm, playgrounds would need to have different requirements than for other handicapped kids.\n\nSwinging is a really nice, exciting and relaxating activity.\u00a0Swings with only a plank do not fit Fabian\u2019s physical needs, since he is not able to hold himself with one arm. Laying on a birds nest swing is more easy for him.\n\nSlides are good to use in case the entrance is easy to reach. Climbing nets or round ladders makes it difficult for Fabian.\u00a0\n\nWater and Sand is an interesting sensorial material, that all childs love. Playing in the mud, splashing with the water, diging holes or baking sand cakes are activities that could be on hip height and done while sitting in a wheelchair.\n\nGetting this insight from a parents view leades us more in the direction of what kids with handicappes are able to do, what they like, what they prefer and what should have been thought from another perspective.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Names changed to protect privacy\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-17 16:49:41", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 04:35:25.051678", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 547, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7826, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1699, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Vertical farms?</b>\n\nHi Rafael, \n\nwelcome to Edgeryders :) Sounds like an interesting initiative, there are several Edgeryders who are also involved in agriculture on some level or another.

The necessary arrangements with the police would be made, negotiating the itinerary of the march. Police showed up, but they would be pretty relaxed. People showed up in large numbers: mothers with prams, old age pensioners, high school kid with Invicta backpacks, men walking their dogs, whatever. The demographics was everybody.\n\nThe message sent to the government would be in the numbers: a stronger presence would mean more heartily felt disagreement with the government's policies. People did not try to storm government buildings or clash with the police - that was not the point ot it. Somebody would give a speech, but these marches were so big that perhaps only a few tens of thousands (out of a few hundreds of thousands) would get to hear them. Newspapers, t-shirts and mineral water would be sold. People would chat and socialize, as they marched and on the myriad special trains and buses to and from Rome. All in all, a highly ritualized, civilized affair. At that time (the late 80s and 90s) Italy had one of the highest turnout at the elections in the West.\n\nAt the time I really believed in it: a channel for public dissent that was friendly to all citizens, irrespective of age and physical conditions.

They originally wanted to center their effort on development aid. The sure won't mind to give you privileged access to things that could help you. They often run themed competitions - perhaps that would be a way to leverage the community there?\n\nI would very much like to give more input on building an audio-library, as I think that will be the most appropriate in many situations. Currently there is only a very limited amount of material available that could be used without adaptation. This can be seen as an opportunity as well though, as it is not very complicated to produce content - like you already mentioned. As a healthy system should have information flowing in various directions, one could seed** this library and listen to what they want/need more of. Then this could be supplied in a lean format (e.g. text + images) and slowly and collaboratively turned into a more accessible format. Basically producing podcasts*. I have made some back-of-envelope calcs on this already a while ago and my take is that this would be very promising in the long term.\n\nSpeaking of long term, I had envisioned a system that would work with extremely long lived electronics (caps/batteries/IO ports would eventually be separately replaceable). The packaging of the electronics would be critical if you want a lifetime of say 50-100 years out of them. I recommend casting them in high quality silicone and plugging extenders into the ports with very sturdy strain relief (e.g. paracord sheath along the outer 4/5th). You may want to consider using clean sand to help with heat conduction. Also it won't hurt to put this into a wooden box - again with strain relief for any wires going out. I would strongly recommend to stock up on spare parts nonetheless.\n\nFor each each library server my idea would be to have 3 working and 1 dead used mp3 players, with about 20 partially working earplugs, some solder, perhaps acoustic membrane film, and a piece of metal that can be used as a soldering tip when heated in coals, and of course an audio guide to fixing earplugs and the most likely defects of audio players. The idea being that the audio players need very, very little electricity and they could be shared between three kids each - promoting social cohesion. I know this will probably go over budget, but If you think it might fly - one could try to expand the budget. It would be relatively simple to argue for this on a number of different grounds.\n\n*The problem with producing podcasts \"in the wild\" as opposed to \"in the basement\" will likely be background noises that you can't run away from, or shut out effectively.

A country like Bangladesh, which is constantly facing threats of so many kinds of natural disaster, is being increasingly ignorant about its natural conservation. This country has only 17% of forests within. This by the way is getting narrower. Even the largest mangrove forest Sundarbans, which is an internationally recognized world heritage site, is also facing terrible manmade disasters and constant environmental pollutions. It has reached such a zenith, that the global-ecosystem is threatened with the loss of a majority of all species, by the end of this century. Everyone knows, but some chose to ignore it, some choose to remain silent about it. But I thought the simplest solution to address this problem is just plant more trees. It\u2019s a simple yet most productive solution to involve the youth, who first of all should be concerned about it; secondly should take initiatives to mitigate this problem. The idea to run an online campaign came to me due to the massive participation of youth in social media. My goals were very simple, engaging the youth to talk about the problem or at least make them realize how important it is to address the issue. Secondly, mobilize my community to take an initiative in real space so that they feel the necessity to do something about this particular problem.\n\nAlong with few friends, I started inviting people over facebook to join the event. All they had to do is plant 5 trees and nominate 5 other friends on facebook to replicate the same. This way it will work like a chain reaction and we will be able to see a huge number of trees getting planted in a short period of time. The campaign is still going on and more people are joining. I know it has not gone viral and the number is not that high. Because in reality if you want to mobilize your community for a good cause, you have to ensure some motivations for them. Social norms are something that people tend to follow. Online campaign is there to help create a buzz, to create an objective. Which means if someone can bring out the movement from online space to offline, it moves faster and better. This is exactly why I have planned to run this campaign both online and offline.\n\nPrimarily I even offered few things extra to carry on with the campaign. Since I am an online based entrepreneur and I have a client tale which is 3 years old, we kind of have a personal trust relationship with each \u00a0other. So I personally offered my clients, I'll plant trees on behalf of them for every sell worth $10.\n\nTo bring the campaign to reality, a part of that plan involves talking to the civil society and involving them. Therefore, we are in touch with mayor\u2019s office to propose an idea to tell the citizens, if they plants 5 trees, they'll get a discount on their TAX. The CEO\u2019s of top notch companies to take part in this initiative where we want them to initiate a tree plantation program as a part of their CSR activities. Encourage their employees to plant trees so that they can get a better record at the end of the year in the ACR. We've asked the Headmasters of local schools to run the campaign along with the students, whoever plants more trees and takes care of them properly, will get an excellence award &amp; certificate from the school. Recently our PM received the award of CHAMPION of the Earth for her outstanding initiative on\u00a0increasing forests and going green. I am simply trying to follow her path to make a change. Because I believe, OXYGEN is the most needed thing on earth and one can not simply buy a healthy environment with money. It takes proper plan and interest to create a land full of trees and a lot of patient. I got inspired by watching BHUTAN be the very first carbon negative country. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/187a482ab6f00199e06702f93d59eb7ded464999.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\nThere is a chinese proverb saying ' The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is now. ' So, I believe in trying for a good cause. To save our galaxy. We only have one home, planet earth. You should start too.\n\nBecause, if not now, when? If not me , who will?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-22 22:18:14", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 04:32:55.502453", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 846, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 3097.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17380, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4569, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Yep, the way to go for the session</b>\n\nHi Cosmin, I am so grateful to Alex for introducing you, I know Funky is getting quite well known and you and Elena (whom I only heard great things of) are doing the dirty work that needs to be done.

I've thought in a similar direction I believe, so I'll throw in some comments and see what sticks.\n\n<em>Re You can identify people who are especially interested in [...]</em>\n\nHere is what I tried to do at a multi-day p2p event:\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://reso-nance.org/whattheflok/_media/photos/bestof/accueil.jpg\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 267px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://reso-nance.org/whattheflok/_media/photos/bestof/cloud.jpg?w=200&amp;h=130&amp;tok=9c35b0\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 242px;\">\n\nMost people did not have a connection with each other when they came, so the idea was that you put post-its on the topics if you would like to discuss it something (it failed, probably for more than one reason). That is relatively similar to your twitter wall - correct? I used a \"soft cartesian sorting method\" based on two broad categories (+antonym) the stuff falls into.\n\nI think it actually makes most sense BEFORE an event physically kicks off (say during travel to the event) to do a lot of meet &amp; greet stuff on twitter. During the event I would try to push people to establish milestones or follow-ups for AFTER the meeting.\n\n<em>Re interested in specific topics</em>\n\nI've tried to build a mock-up interface for documenting generic projects in a way that interfaces nicely with a network framework. I think the interest is usually greatest for a combination of topics + a specific purpose (i.e. a project). Here the purpose is to improve the documentation of projects in hackerspaces and fablabs (I have more detail on this topic if you are interested).\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/be119fa999f160d5a6484ebe3fa1dd340791a4ff.png\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nThe gray font symbolizes a sort of coarse mind map (connections currently not drawn) that is stretched according to the phrases you use to sort this stuff along XY axes (these could also be changed dynamically of course). The black font is for the \"high level work packages\" (in PM lingo). You could explode them into more detail (many more specific phrases) to see what has progressed how far, where there are obstacles, comments, and of course who is working on what currently. The greyish wedges are currently just placeholders to symbolize, say, 2 x 500 man-hours that two initially separate groups will probably have to spend coming from the theoretical, as well as the practical side of things. The degree of blurriness could symbolize the confidence in the prediction. It is essentially somewhat similar in thrust to what <a href=\"/u/ola\">@Ola</a> has written <a href=\"https://medium.com/methodkit-stories/the-double-diamond-16c74e3c4869\">here,</a> and I hope to be able to \"map\" these dynamics effectively on this basis.\n\nAs you can see I try to move away from looking at nodes (people) as agents and focus more on a project with impact (and perhaps certain edge structures) as attracting more or less efficiently the necessary resources (connectors, man-hours, resources, etc.). I am aware that people probably remain the most important element for some time to come - but a) people are non-digital (an twitter is IMHO a very small, very unrepresentative subgroup) b) the change in perspective may allow me to perceive things that are almost hidden otherwise. I think that is pretty much what you were doing when you looked at the 18 \"champions\". Of course the project needs to interface effectively and efficiently with people. If you have accumulated some machine readable data that is project relevant, I think a pretty detailed and comprehensive plan could be produced, that would easily pay back the 5-15 minutes it needs to be produced. Basically you would <a href=\"http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045\">drag a default suggestion</a> into the shape that makes most sense to you, add relationships (e.g. prioritize, make milestones &amp; gateways, timings), swap some phrases, and watch what promising connections this would find via twitter (or linkedin etc.). If you have such a tag and relationship rich plan that can be viewed using various perspectives (\"cartesian coordinates\"), or mapped onto social networks it becomes extremely easy for potential collaborators to hook up with you, or perhaps coordinate one of their milestones with you to produce synergies.\n\n<em>Re you know who you would need to approach for future events, discussions etc. &gt; find the champions</em>\n\nI would be careful with that conclusion because this is what I already see a lot happening in real life, and it is a very mixed blessing. Well meaning people are quickly drowned under a deluge of requests. Good work begets more work. The devil sh*ts on the biggest pile. I think what you want to do is find the 2-3 people connected to the champions who have the <em>potential </em>to BECOME a champion themselves (through a specific topic). Finding and \"harvesting\" the champions out of a community does not create more value overall. Of course if you target them in order to empower them more (or give them compatible sidekicks) - you are quite right.\n\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\" style=\"position: absolute; top: -1999px; left: -1988px;\">you know who you would need to approach for future events, discussions etc. &gt; find the champions - See more at: https://edgeryders.eu/en/catalyst-collaboration/investigating-the-matera-lote4-twitter#sthash.olSZH2Ma.dpuf</div>\n\n<div style=\"position: absolute; top: -1999px; left: -1988px;\">Really cool would be if this could be used instantly on a twitter wall during events - See more at: https://edgeryders.eu/en/catalyst-collaboration/investigating-the-matera-lote4-twitter#sthash.olSZH2Ma.dpuf</div>\n\n<div style=\"position: absolute; top: -1999px; left: -1988px;\">Really cool would be if this could be used instantly on a twitter wall during events - See more at: https://edgeryders.eu/en/catalyst-collaboration/investigating-the-matera-lote4-twitter#sthash.olSZH2Ma.dpuf</div>", "created_at": "2015-05-15 12:12:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:44.501002", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1020, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19577, "user_id": 3402, "topic_id": 759, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Great!</b>\n\nSee you soon!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-18 11:08:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.132119", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19572], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8405, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 517, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>I'd love to discuss this some more</b>\n\nI have a background in materials and engineering.

This model was initially based on 3 principles - transparency, participation and collaboration. This would mean a dramatic change...\n\nWhen I first heard about the Open Government Directive, introduced by Barack Obama in the United States in 2009, I saw in this directive the potential for comprehensive public sector innovation. Most initiatives have focused on transparency, data and technology, as if these would allow to solve serious problems. Citizens now realize that no serious problem has really been solved by these solutions. Except maybe for a few exceptions, such as the Peer-to-Patent platform designed by Beth Noveck. The focus on transparency, the focus on technology as the solution, rather a part of a bigger strategy, is generating a superficial approach, an easy out approach to the much harder systems change that would be needed. The initial open government model has morphed into technology initiatives. Many equate innovation with technology, rather than the deeper social organization, service and funding redesign.\n\nPreviously, we used to think: \"<em>Let's find</em><em> solutions together, government and citizens</em>.\"\n\nBut now citizens realize that this may not work anymore, because it is easier for risk adverse organizations to reduce their model than to handle the much harder and more complex design and public sector innovation though action and implementation. This way, the human factor isn't in the way.\n\nEdgeryders participants explained in numerous mission reports that they have experienced non-collaboration from governments.\n\nNow, the new line of thinking seems to be: \"<em>Should I make the decisions for you?</em>\" This is a serious shift in thinking. The decisions makers used to take the decisions. Not anymore?\n\nOne participant of the session suggested to focus on city level, to obtain collaboration. But later, he concluded that \"cities are old style\". Even the municipal level, which has always been considered as closer to citizens, is no longer able to generate much enthusiasm from citizens.\n\n<strong>Let's figure out new ways</strong>\n\nThe issues of isolated cultures, language barriers, were discussed by the participants, which highlighted that we are a risk of creating universal values, which may be superficial. Main cultural differences, respect the other. Understanding each other \u2013 shared visions.\n\nSome worried about the technology gap. Not all citizens are familiar with computers. What happens when the number of connected citizens reaches a critical mass?\n\nWho's responsible for transforming data into meaningful applications? Good interface to be able to converge, process, create new data. New applications. Autodata/netention: interface that enables to input situations to match them.\n\nParticipants talked about emergent forms of governments. Semantic web government. The larger picture, keep it a every moment of the time by using maps. Triple stores, semantic protocols. Huge graphs to get larger perspectives.\n\nHave a single profile allowing to be active in different initiatives.\n\nPractical form of sharing is technically feasible...\n\nAvoid bureaucracy...\n\n<strong>The 1% critical mass</strong>\n\nMeanwhile, Deepak Chopra launched a new global collaboration project, the ChopraWell. <em>'</em><em>Critical mass can change the world and it starts with YOU</em>. <a href=\"http://t.co/XJU6iotw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://bit.ly/LkFdkz\">http://bit.ly/LkFdkz</a>\n\nI wrote a mission report about what Chopra would do if he had 100 million dollars. The 100 million dollars have morphed into 100 million people... <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/we-sharers/mission_case/harness-collective-creativity\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/we-sharers/mission_case/harness-collective-creativity</a>\n\n<strong>This is just the beginning</strong>\n\nThe Edgecamp is over, and the participants went back home, their heads filled with information, bits of conversations and ideas. This week, the participants of this session have are brainstorming and considering several possible paths.\n\nStay tuned!

The Castle is in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, England an area with high unemployment, a high percentage of people living in poverty, high rates of teen pregnancy and drug addiction, and where incidents of domestic violence are well above the national average.\n\nHere is a<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/58cede64-bb4f-11e3-8d4a-00144feabdc0.html\"> recent article in the Financial Times about Jonathan and the project</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://aucklandcastle.org/\">Auckland Castle</a>\n\nIn the interest of time I have edited down the 1 and a half hour interview to approximately 12 minutes, sorry for the brutal jump cuts. I have transcribed some parts of the interview below.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/109311083?byline=0&amp;portrait=0\n\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/109311083\">JonathanRuffer</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/unmonastery\">unMonastery</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.\n\n\"I am very comfortable with the word stewardship because I am, by personality, an old fart, and I find an antique word one that I am quite happy to live with. And I am a heavy duty Christian and stewardship is a Christian idea\u2026 It raises the whole question of what the nature of ownership is\u2026 one has to get away from ownership to really get at what is going on.\"\n\n\u201cI have no training in anything that would be useful in a deprived community. And I thought about it and the two things I can do is I can encourage people and I can unify people.\u201d\n\n\u201c The Zurbar\u00e1n pictures were being sold by the church for a very big sum of money and they are the only things of value in this area that are not nailed down\u2026 but those pictures would have gone to Russia. It is a very big discouragement. I thought that by rescuing them this would be a stake in the ground for what I wanting to do and then it became clear that I had unlocked a door of a retractable problem, which was what was going to happen to this great resource of Bishop Auckland of the castle.\u00a0\u00a0 And I have a view that if we can make this place, a place of great beauty and somewhere that people will come as a destination\u2026 because it is a resource of Bishop Auckland\u2026 the town was invented to serve the castle, now the castle must serve the town. It is a walk of faith, I am doing this because I feel called to it, and if people say to me just how will it help the town the answer is well we will see\u2026. And of course I don\u2019t know what the vision is, I feel like an old testament prophet, where I absolutely know what I am doing, I have to do\u2026. what it means is not yet clear to me. The work that I feel frustrated I can do is being done second hand and in my view that is the important work. If I could look forward I think that Auckland Castle will turn out to be a catalyst to make the important stuff happen but it will not itself be the important stuff\u2026. I think money, which looks to be such a powerful thing, isn\u2019t\u2026what it tells you is actually how difficult it is to make 54 million quid do anything.\u00a0 I see this as a building that needs to pull itself together having sucked life from the town from for 800 years it now needs to give it back but it does not know how. I am mortified by the fact that I am kept away from what I see as the real work downtown.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow to you bring people to see that you don\u2019t have to be hierarchical, that ownership is not the key, that all these ways of thinking are distortions of a greater truth.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-18 12:08:43", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 10:25:19.707298", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 778, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10376, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 5925, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>asap</b>\n\n@Alberto - thank you for the feedback !

Like other megacities, Cairo is an engine of art, business, science and progress; yet suffers from noise, traffic and smog. Transportation planning and policy making has failed.\n\nTfC seeks to map all formal and informal transportation in Cairo digitally, and release all data openly. What might seem obvious and expected of any European city does not exist in Cairo: A clear and comprehensive answer to the question of How do I get there!\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4009915c24ce9fc638bcaaf5073ccae50782b908.jpeg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nMain Bus Arteries in Cairo\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\"Cairo is a patchwork of individual solutions\"</h3>\n\nThe Bus network in Cairo evolved progressively over time. Each new bus route created was meant to solve an individual transportation problem. Transportation planning based on expected future needs did not take place. In the 1970\u2019s, the government started to license individual bus drivers to operate some routes it could not handle on its own. Over time, some drivers started operating routes that were not licensed by the government to fulfil actual demand by commuters. This is a highly informal way of finding individual solutions to the failure of the wider transportation system.\n\nLittle to no information on routes, stops, service frequency or schedules of public buses exist, neither in analogue nor in digital form. Furthermore, 40% of Cairo\u2019s transportation is covered by informally organised mini-buses where no information exists at all. Commuters have to rely on unreliable word-of-mouth for trip planning, missing the opportunity to choose the fastest, cheapest or most convenient routes. This is a social issue that affects every Egyptian commuter.\n\nFurthermore, professional planners and researchers lack a comprehensive map of the cities\u2019 transportation system. Currently, we do not understand how the city functions. Therefore, any social and sustainable development of Cairo\u2019s transportation system is difficult. Inequities in access to health, education and culture foster due to the systems largely informal nature, yet are not quantifiable at present. Targeted action is not possible. \u00a0\n\nTransport for Cairo is essentially a map of these individual solutions as well. This mapping exercise gives us considerable expertise to share. For LOTE5, we are planning to hold a session to share our experience, discuss the ongoing challenges and debate the vices and virtues of informality. Informal organisation solved the failures of government, yet created challenges of their own. Can informality be leveraged to fix societal problems in a sustainable way?\n\nFor now, we will be looking to refine the contents of the session, and the questions we wish to find an answer to.

It was this kind of event Edgeryders hosted in 2013 that birthed the unMonastery concept based on hackers\u2019 residency projects, as well as the Viral Academy based on peer to peer online learning. We think we can build many more community projects like these, and in June we are all coming together in Tbilisi, Georgia to compare notes and build on each other\u2019s initiatives.\n\n<strong>About Edgeryders: </strong>We are a global community of over 2000 individuals experimenting with solutions to social, economic, ecological challenges. We collaborate online on our open, free and self-hosted platform, and gather physically about once a year in whole-community scale events.

I was vacinated for various things (occasionally after a pause for partents to consider this), with only one scar to show for it as far as I know. One broken thumb fixed (utility cycling accident), one broken wrist fixed (silly skateramp bike accident) - both a few years ago now, but my memories of the fixing up are only good. Even though in the latter case the break, and associated hospital visit, was hundreds of miles away from my home town (a national service is important! ). I've also had support with depression and anxiety, a less positive experience involving longer waiting times, but ultimately this was pretty good as well - and was really important to me at the time that it was free at the point of need. Some prescription charges through the years, which is not so great, but they were affordable for me at the time (and they don't apply to those on certain benefits in the UK). Blood tests and some B12 injections to make sure my vitamin and mineral balance was coping with veganism, I'm really grateful for that. I have a very supportive, friendly GP, who has allayed my fears when I have gone to check things I was worried about checked out - I wouldn't hesistate to make an appointment if I was worried about somthing - I wouldn't (at the moment!) have to worry about whether or not I could afford the appointment or any treatment.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOther experiences: my sister had a squint sorted out. A friend had a major operation which saved her life but left her paralysed, years of physio, and another operation which sadly couldn't save her life again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul><li><b style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;\"><span>What didn\u2019t work so well and how did you find the way around the problem?</span></b></li></ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\nI can't really think of anything. I'm lucky to have services nearby - in the past transport to GP/Hospital has been an issue as I don't drive.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul><li><b style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;\"><span>What does that suggest about how to improve the resilience of society in this area?</span></b></li></ul>\n\n</div>Not a lot, really... Save to prioritise health (\"there is no wealth but life\") over the imaginary 'wealth' of the financial system. Public health systems are struggling under cuts, but what's that - banks are still getting bailed out to the tune of billions?\n\nMaybe what we need to think about when we think about health is not only Resilience but *Resistance* to the global attacks on publicly owned healthcare systems, and to the monopolies of the Pharmaceutical industry. We certainly need to avoid feeding into the propaganda that publicly owned health systems are inefficient or ineffective. I actually think these systems are more resilient than we might think at first too - are doctors and nurses going to stop having a caring impulse because the system of financial transactions is creaking? Are they going to begin to deny their expertise to people? I think I would argue that the bigger threat to public health is less a financial crisis and rather more the priorities of the current financial system!\n\nI'm slightly concerned by phrases like:\n\n<b style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:medium;font-weight:normal\"><span>\"get creative about improving health prevention and care, so that what\u2019s most important gets done as well as possible given the circumstances?\"</span></b>\n\nand\n\n\"The idea was to figure out ways to empower communities to co-design and co-deliver their own health care \u00a0- and the <em>real</em> idea, of course, was to save some tax \u00a3 in the process\"\n\nHaving been involved in a long campaign against a so-called 'social enterprise' that threatened to fragment our local health services - removing them from the National Health Service and the associated public accountability, exemption from VAT, national economies of scale and bargaining power etc etc, makes me VERY cautious about being \"creative\" with ownership models (see here for video footage of me explaining the campaign, and issues in the UK health sector at present: http://keepglosnhspublic.posterous.com/public-meeting-thursday-15th-march-2012 and the root link http://keepglosnhspublic.posterous.com for lots of information on the campaign).\n\nI am very aware of the need to consider the challenge of peak oil to healthcare (and I'll admit that financial collapse poses risks as well). I'm less convinced that demography is a problem - this seems to be the argument of those who will cut pensions as they increase spending on wars.\n\nIf not particularly keen on upping taxes on health 'bads' as a solution either. I'm not a smoker, and hated coming home from my barman job stinking of smoke, but in the UK, high taxes and bans on smoking has not stopped everyone smoking - they have just stigmatised people, helped break centres of community (pubs, which are closing very quickly), and raised a lot of money for the government from people who are addicted to something (and hence unable to make a free choice). Not a great solution as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI'm personally particularly interested in the public health issues around weight - and the possible positive work that policies on food and transport could do to improve diets and increase exercise. Not taxes or financial inducements, but the redesign of cities to reduce car ownership and use and increase walking and cycling, and education in, and shared public spaces given over to, cooking and growing food.\n\nAll for now, look forward to discussing this in person!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-13 23:40:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.555204", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1358, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9253], "is_liked_by": [3756], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2611, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2578, "post_number": 1, "raw": "A few days ago I published <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-is-hiring-a-part-time-social-media-manager-salary-3000-euros-for-3-months-renewable-contract/2527\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">this job opportunity for a Social Media Manager</a> for Edgeryders. One after one good ideas started showing up in the comments. It turns out that even in a situation that in other contexts would be framed as competitive, Edgeryders community members are open and tend to collaborate. \n\nIt also reminded me that the whole point of Edgeryders is to come together and build infrastructure to support community members and others future-building work, not reproduce the dynamics of artificial scarcity. \n\nSo I got an idea. And checked with everyone involved. We\u2019ve decided we are NOT hiring a person for a temporary job.\n\nInstead we are going to build a new communications agency lead by a stellar team. They are:\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.wamda.com/application/rapyd/assets/mfm_012/upload/said_hamideh.jpg\" style=\"height:195px; width:155px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://g4.nh.ee/images/pix/900x585/f645e2fd/file65240888_e598c0b1.jpg\" style=\"height:195px; width:300px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LuJdTnxyrbU/UgvQIfFmQOI/AAAAAAAAAB0/P-k0GOehphY/w800-h800/photo.jpg\" style=\"height:195px; width:195px\">\n\n@SaidHamideh: well you saw <a href=\"https://twitter.com/saidhamideh/status/446343693125959680\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">his proposal</a>. It kind of speaks for itself.\n\n@Dorotea : GETS community. Especially this community. She is also on the <a href=\"/t/social-media-team/444\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">Social Media Team</a> and knows the platform well.\n\n@Daniel_Vaarik: I could tell you. But you wouldn\u2019t believe me. <a href=\"/t/the-edgeryders-guide-to/327-the-baltic/united-estonia-and-political-change-in-estonia\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">Check it out</a> for yourself.\n\n<strong>You:</strong> This will only work if you, me and everyone we know gets behind this effort.\n\n<h3> </h3>\n\n<h1>A new kind of agency for the bleeding edge</h1>\n\nMany of us have chosen to take the path less travelled. And it is very hard to be good at everything. During \\#lote3 a room full of people building really awsome projects said they could really use help with design and communication. Plus many of us simply prefer getting on with the work we are passionate about, rather than promoting our projects or even ourselves. But we\u2019re happy to contribute towards supporting one another if someone is coordinating and making it easy, fun and meaningful to do so.\n\nThe purpose of the Edgeryders in house agency is to help us get really really good at leveraging our collective online presence to:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Support individual community member\u2019s projects</li>\n\n<li>Support the Edgeryders company projects and sales processes</li>\n\n<li>Do outreach work for external clients. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe revenue from the outreach work for external client projects will go back into covering the costs of communications work for the Edgeryders community projects.\n\nEdgeryders company would be the first official client. I set up a <a href=\"http://company.edgeryders.eu/\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">company website here</a>, but we clearly need help with the pitch, and to get word around to prosepective clients.  We will all pitch in to the efforts to secure paid clients for the new agency but Said, Daniel, Dorotea will guide and coodinate the efforts.\n\n<strong>So we\u2019re just going to hand over half of the Edgeryders company communication budget and trust you guys to manage it well.</strong>\n\nIt amounts to enough money for Said to drive the implementation of his proposal (3500 USD) and an additional 2000 USD as seed funding for this new venture. If this agency is successful in building a serious client base this will contribute towards more paid work opportunities finding their way to the community, so it makes sense for everyone who can to help out. We'll give it our best shot for three months and then do a public review of the results after which we decide if we want to continue.\n\n<h3>What kind of work or clients?</h3>\n\nIn Edgeryders those who do the work calls the shots, so it\u2019s really up to the co-founders to decide what projects they want to work on. They, like other community members, were however drawn to Edgeryders because \u201c we are working together to make the world a better place and have a fairly aligned idea of what better means\u201d as Leo puts it. Community members are not in anyone\u2019s chain of command, so the success of the different gigs will depend on the team ensuring that the work aligned with the community members' values.\n\nOur requirements in exchange for the seed funding are:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>That outreach efforts draw people towards the community and interacting on the community platform: using third party services like FB and Twitter solely to share links that point back into edgeryder.eu landing pages so we don't fragment the community. </li>\n\n<li>We coordinate and collaborate on communications efforts on the platform through e.g <a href=\"/t/working-out-loud-on-spot-the-future-what-we-are-doing-this-week/2566\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46);\">working out loud posts</a>.</li>\n\n<li>That a contract is signed with the Edgeryders Company that outlines the agreements between the individual co-founders, and between the co-founders as a group and the community as a whole.</li>\n\n</ol>", "created_at": "2014-03-25 09:20:47", "updated_at": "2018-03-02 17:05:37.021666", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 930, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30169, "user_id": 2932, "topic_id": 4830, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Hello everybody, we (Comune di Milano) signed the Grant \u00a0Agreement.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-12 15:20:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:46.157667", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5344, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5311, "post_number": 1, "raw": "last week I met with Angelo Di Mambro (journalist, video producer and communications consultant based in Brussels).\n\nWe had a really interesting conversation about Storytelling for engagement. Especially when it involves introducing your intended audience to some new concept or way of doing things, this can be very difficult.\n\nSo we started looking at previous efforts to do this. We started by analysing our experiences of having worked with communication for over 10 years. Then we explored how much respected storytellers such as George Lucas and my first mentor, award winning Swedish Director Roy Andersson, go about building engaging stories.\n\nIt was so much fun that Angelo has decided join me in leading this workshop.\u00a0<span>Later today Angelo and I are meeting again. One of the topics we will be discussing is how to use myths and archetypes in effective storytelling for engagement.\u00a0An interesting aspect for a transnational community is which myths and narratives are culturally specific and which ones seem to resonate with everyone. It taps into something which I think is very relevant to the design of the OpenCare engagement process. Bear with me as I try to articulate what is no more than\u00a0an early intuition...</span>\n\nAt the turn of this year\u00a0I had a brief exchange with\u00a0Evan Roth, one of the early movers in net art and fellow activist. Like many others who grew up on the Internet and who have been fighting against the erosion of civil liberties, he was heartbroken and disenchanted after\u00a0the Snowden revelations. A kind of collective depression was tangible in the scene, a lot of people for whom this was the first experience of engaging with mainstream politics just dropped out.\u00a0\n\nOthers have been engaging\u00a0with the significant challenge of making the techno-social debate accessible, and engaging, to people outside the tech scene and Brussels bubble. This is sorely needed. Kirsten Fielder,\u00a0Julia Reda, Walter Van Holst, our own Erik Lakomaa\u00a0(all coming to \\#lote5) and Amelia Andersdotter have\u00a0first-hand experiences\u00a0of the difficulties involved.<em>\u00a0Amelia in particular has been very active in the debate around data security and patient privacy in Sweden.</em>\n\nEvan's talk at \\#32c3 is a poetic description of how he tried to make this overwhelming, abstract infrastructure something with which he could engage as an artist (\u00a01hr video).\u00a0Julian Oliver's creative practice comes at things more from a critical engineering perspective: he has built\u00a0functional objects which both critique and circumvent the offending practices or technologies e.g\u00a0http://transparencygrenade.com/\n\nThose of us working on OpenCare will be facing the similar challenge\u00a0of making\u00a0difficult (or\u00a0abstract) topics/debates and insights\u00a0more accessible. Both to\u00a0people who are curious, but need a \"soft\" way into the conversations...as well as\u00a0to community members, practitioners and relevant decision-makers e.g legislators. So I thought it<span>\u00a0might be interesting to engage product designers to make some of the more difficult or abstract topics/debates \"easier\" to approach through the lens of critical design (as an example see\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.backslash.cc/\">http://www.backslash.cc/</a>)<span>. Maybe even produce an exhibition at the final event taking place in Milan. This could fit into the prototyping phase of the project. Or it could be a separate parallel strand.

On one of the Sunday afternoon web telephone meet-ups, I proposed these as:\u00a0 in-house / interface / outreach.\u00a0 Hidden in this premise was the impression that we would be starting at subsistence level among an, at best, neutral host community that would ignore us if they could.\n\nThis was a defensive position, perhaps understandable, but far from reality.\u00a0 Blinded by the bad PR given troglodyte cave-persons by a globalised popular culture, it was hard to surmise that the opposite is closer to the truth.\u00a0 It should be no surprise that a city with a 9000 year old history supports layers of civilized human interaction that might put the cultural environment in say, Bergen, the merely 1000 year old city in which I live, to shame.\n\nThis immediately became apparent during our formal informal launch workshop last weekend.\u00a0 Something unspecific about the quality of attention in the room, had me already noting down the following in my journal half way through the introductory presentation:\n\n<em>\u00a0... I have been jumping up and down saying that proposing projects before we are surrounded by reality, is bad development politics... dreams are useful, but they are dreams -- We from the outside have been thinking about parachuting ideas upon Matera.\u00a0 Even when we know that we shouldn\u2019t do this, such thoughts are all we have...</em>\u00a0 (the rant continued)\n\nBy the time the slide proposing the in-house/ interface/outreach model came up, I was interrupting Gaia\u2019s presentation with an engaged voice from the back of the hall. \u00a0 Publicly taking responsibility for the exclusion, I suggested a fourth category based upon my reading of the\u00a0 palpable concern in the room:\u00a0 that if we were to be truly responsive to our hosts, much of our work should be based upon injected, installed or invited projects that had their base in commissions from the community at large.\u00a0 I\u2019d suggest that this is a lot closer to the way things are going to be working.</span>\n\n<span>At least, that\u2019s how things have evolved for a chronic project person such as myself.\u00a0 Hence my warning to all you Project-monkeys:\u00a0 be prepared for a life complex.\u00a0 After four days in Matera, I gained an additional two projects to be constructed with new friends ...\u00a0 Which one goes first?</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-26 13:51:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.912356", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 546, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25799], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16195, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 670, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Young men and construction materials</b>\n\nThanks for sharing, @Tomma , and welcome to Edgeryders.

Apologies in advance, this is pretty much all questions, I think we can learn a lot from your experience creating this form of housing and the way its changed over the years. I especially relate to and heed your advice about the too many meetings thing ;) . I\u2019m curious to know more about the impetus for starting such a project, if as you say didn\u2019t know each other and had no common identity or belonging, how did you find each other and make the\u00a0decision together?\u00a0 Also curious to know how it was initially funded, did you rent or buy a building and grow from there or did you build something new (the image with your post is a co-housing experiment I\u2019m somewhat familiar with, is it related somehow?).\n\nIn regards \u201cmicro-welfare\u201d and mutual support, have you communized your money or is there a separate fund that members pay into for these kinds of things? This is something we\u2019ve been discussing for our group and haven\u2019t figured out quite how to do it with the constraints of an economy like NYC. Have these things created a situation where people are able to work less or not at all?\u00a0\n\nIn regards the \u201cgated community\u201d comment and talking about how you interact with the greater neighborhood, I'm curious to know how you\u2019ve navigated this and what your outwardly facing presence is like both in terms of your activity and the neighborhoods perception of your community.\u00a0 If you work with local government/neighborhood councils, is this something you do out of necessity, as something that sees it as a tool but not a goal or does that participation have value to you in and of itself? I ask because we've gotten involved with local government at times, but we see it as purely strategic, we won't do anything with them that would require some kind of compromise because ultimately we are interested in autonomy from all forms of governance. We think of our outward facing projects as building a territory. In\u00a0a place like nyc where creating one\u00a0large place where many people can live together and actually spatially put their lives in common is not really possible, we have formed a network that is concentrated in a neighborhood but spreads across the whole city and connects with like minded hubs in the rest of the country. An important question we ask ourselves is how do we keep this open to all forms of life that would grow our power and we theirs. I would pose the same to your group, how do keep it from becoming an isolated, if enviable situation, which is not merely its own ends?\u00a0 Would love to know if your model has the intention to put itself forth as a form that could be replicable, maybe it alreay\u00a0does? If you have ways that you formally share your experiences with other groups so they might learn and begin to try these things for themselves in their particular regions? Would love to know more about any or\u00a0all of these things.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-16 18:05:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:56.864653", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 552, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26628, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5825, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>28-29/11 works for me too</b>\n\nYay!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-31 14:53:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:27.473445", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24178, "user_id": 2216, "topic_id": 3148, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Dear Nadia and Noemi, the venue is not going to be a problem as long as we go out somewhere afterwards, and \"Old Tbilisi\" is a great place for that, especially the area around Bauhause...

In its part of the economy, its been increasing the velocity of circulation of money around the stock market by several orders of magnitude. So if V did affect the price level to any degree at all, share prices would be through the roof in the last few years, and in fact it would be possible to track the affect just by the introduction of HFT on the different exchanges. \u00a0\n\nThe other way to argue against that is through a thought experiment. Imagine an economy with 1 tool, 1 coin and two participants who exchange the tool for the coin any time they want to use it. It's quite clear that however quickly or slowly they do that, they can't affect the price level. [And as you probably know, formally in math, you only need one sucessful counter-example to disprove any theorem.]\n\nAs far as the wheat example goes. Strictly speaking, wheat doesn't get included in GDP because it's not a final good (but that's just me being pedantic ...) But if it did, in your example then it would be the total value of wheat sold (price * quantity). If the introduction of a plough increased the amount of wheat produced, all other things being equal, the price of wheat would drop, and GDP would stay the same. Except that since there are now extra transactions involving ploughs, and the money being used for that isn't establishing the price level for wheat, the price level would drop due to monetary deflation, and so would GDP.\n\nWhat normalising GDP against the money supply does, is correct for the underlying growth in the unit of measurement (money). It seems to go somewhat overlooked by economists that as the money supply grows, so does the unit of measurement, and although a lot of things get corrected for CPI inflation, this isn't a sufficient correction - partly because CPI only applies to a sub-set of goods, and also because of the production/money supply inverse relationship. But the \"transactive intensity\" of GDP is the flip side of velocity - the more transactions - the more exchanges of money within the economy - and they cancel.\n\nAs to whether or not you need to increase the money suppply in the way many economists seem to think is necessary....\n\nThere certainly have been periods (the middle ages in Europe), where there were problems because of \u00a0physical shortages of monetary tokens (due to metal shortages, and localalised liquidity issues.). But I would gently submit that that hasn't been a problem since banking was introduced, since the bookkeeping entry can always be arbitrarily sub-divided. What I personally think increasing the money supply does do is badly distort the signal that the price level is trying to provide, and also by virtue of where that money is introduced, artificially advantage some economic participants in the economy, and cause an accelerating wealth gap over time. (Decade long periods of time - as you say, this is intrinsically a very slow system.)\n\nHowever - this is something that I really want to explore in a computer simulation - since i have a very nasty feeling that there's something going on between debt and the money supply (outside of its interdependence in the banking system), that may be significant. I think it's very hard to say anything at the moment - we can't really argue about how an economy with a constant money supply would behave, because we've never had one under modern conditions.\n\nI'll get a copy of the paper up so you can read it in the next couple of days,\n\n-- jacky\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-21 17:12:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:05.624604", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 672, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25273, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 1688, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Bossless</b>\n\nAnother <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303379204577474953586383604.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories\">article about Valve and other 'bossless' companies</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-08-12 23:57:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:19.753458", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24653], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19858, "user_id": 1438, "topic_id": 1843, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>local transportation</b>\n\n[Noemi] in the next days I'll gather all the information on bus routes and I'll make updates\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-23 19:58:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:50.587825", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23234, "user_id": 10, "topic_id": 1388, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Crowdsourcing Music</b>\n\nAlberto that's a brillian idea!\n\nDo you thing we can do a some kind of poll/list of Edgeryders platform where people can introduce songs they would like to hear at the party, maybe even vote on the songs posted.\n\nTherefore we can ensure that everybody's musical tastes/prefferences are respected and represented.

The work of Mimers has been brilliant and the slideshow above does a really great job of contextualising the unMonastery space within Matera and the potential laid out so far.\u00a0\n\nI wanted to hold off commenting for a time on this post, since I've had a fairly heavy hand in the process so far - my gut feeling though\u00a0from past experience, participation and of building co-working&amp;living spaces, is that you can't design in advance of the participatants. My current home in North London, now of 3 years was built 5 years ago, 15 of us live and work together but it was built with rigidity in mind and struggles now to allow flexibility for the way in which our practices have dramatically changed. As such, I believe our work and thinking suffers.\u00a0\n\nI'm wary of any form of rigidity and designated spaces that cannot be changed on a whim. Furniture, if we need any? Should be movable, collapsable and cheap in respect to being modifable.\u00a0With that said, in this moment\u00a0without alternative infrastructural solutions, the kitchen sink has to go somewhere.\u00a0\n\nFrom my experience of squatting, there is a book that became the cornerstone to our thinking around furniture and interiors, which I think is important to consider in light of the unMonastery rennovations - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nomadic-Furniture-Projects-Lightweight-Environment/dp/0764330241\">Nomadic Furniture</a>. It would be interesting if unMonastery could provide the space for creating the contemporary update to this amazing book. Myself and Dougald among others started to consider what this might look like in 2009 in the form of the <a href=\"http://learningfromtv.com/2009/11/01/dougald-hine-of-spacemakers-agency/\">Nomadic Infrastructure project</a>, which has since been parked for another time.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-17 14:56:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:55.257100", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 344, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4700, "user_id": 2812, "topic_id": 4667, "post_number": 1, "raw": "How can we organize ourselves for progress in Nepal?\n\nLooking at the topic, \u2018ourselves\u2019 becomes an important word here. Ourselves means, at least for me, I as an individual, then my family, my neighborhood, my society, my ward, my municipality, my district, and at national level, my government. It also includes businesses, different government agencies, non-governmental non-profit seeking organizations, and many others. This is because I am a Nepali, and whatever is from Nepal is ourselves.\n\nI as an individual, however, cannot work or hope to influence all these stakeholders, but I must operate in such a manner that I create an example. This example can hopefully influence people around me, and they can then in turn influence other people, and this can then have a nationwide ripple effect.\n\nSo the question is \u2013 what is this example that I can create that can have a nationwide ripple effect.\n\nThe answer comes when I look at the core of myself \u2013 honesty.\n\nIn Nepal, most of us are all earthquake survivors. We saw how people, immediately after the quake, came together in such a wonderful fashion to save and help others. There was no \u2018you and me don\u2019t know\u2019 feeling, there was no 'I escape and you didn\u2019t'. We wanted to save and help everyone. This was our deepest feeling, and this was the feeling we manifested in our action. There was no dualism in our thoughts and actions. This is what I term honesty.\n\nIf you and I as an individual work with honesty, and what we do feels good in the inside and outside, then our efforts rebound. This was exactly what happened when thousands of people volunteered with to help the earthquake survivors with honesty and integrity, and seeing them more volunteered. Let\u2019s always remain honest like this.\n\nI work for an NGO. After the quake, I was part of many relief distribution efforts. I took many pictures, posted them online, and people even send me money to distribute relief. Could I have done more? I don\u2019t know. I was hungry to help others, I also wanted to see the destruction, be part of it, and help alleviate the suffering of others. How honest was I in my work? Could I have done it better?\n\nI can\u2019t answer that for certainty. But I did what I thought was correct, with integrity, with urgency, and with deepest of care. The result was the immense satisfaction I got out of it. And the fact that I was appreciated and people followed my posts on Facebook and even congratulated me, means what I did was positive, and it encouraged people to do the same.\n\nThe other thing relief distribution taught me was the necessity to coordinate.\n\nThe Government of Nepal was asking us to coordinate with their agencies at different level. Yet, I found out the Government wasn\u2019t coordinating between themselves and facilitating the process of coordination. Their coordination can at best be described as shambles. This created a lot of problem and hampered many relief efforts.\n\nYet, as time went by, the coordination, at least, appeared to improve. Because of that, the relief distribution also improved.\n\nThrough coordination with many people and organizations where were helping the earthquake survivors, I was also able to mobilize volunteers, learn from the experience of others, make my own action more meaningfully, and it all ended up becoming less stressful and a lot less expensive.\n\nMy trip to remote, earthquake ravaged villages also taught me one more extremely valuable lesson, and that is \u2013 listen to the voices of the people.\n\nOur honesty and our coordination can, in fact, improve if you hear the people who are actually the recipients or beneficiaries of our action or intended action. Today, our big leaders, businessmen and women, and NGO leaders have isolated themselves from real people, and when that happens they do not know what the real problem is. How can they come up with real solutions when they don\u2019t even hear from the real people and don\u2019t know the real problem?\n\nSo listen, and listen well, and listen from as many people as possible directly. Listen from village leaders, from housewives, teachers, health workers, students both female and male, listen from as diverse voices as possible.\n\nMany people are even scared of listening. They think they can\u2019t help or it\u2019s too complicated, so what\u2019s the use of listening. But more you listen, the better and the simpler your solutions will be. These voices will also tell you how to solve their problems, locally, and in a more simple way than you can think.\n\nThe vast majority of us will act in an individual level. We are, after all, not leaders of political parties, lawyers, bureaucrats and business leaders. We are ordinary Nepalis. Yet, our actions, if we do it in a positive way, can influence our country in a better way.\n\nIn an individual level, what better way to act than by being honest with ourselves. This honesty, however, is also relative. It can change. That\u2019s why we must endeavor to open ourselves. And you do that by listening to people, and by coordinating your actions and plans with others around you, be it at a local or a national level. When we do this, we empower each other and transform our nation.\n\nThat is how we must organize ourselves.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-20 08:57:19", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 19:48:46.055868", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 955, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2687, 2554, 212], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29591, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1870, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>European Social Innovation Competition \u2013 round 2</b>\n\nThis year too, I am to be a judge of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/policy/social-innovation/competition/launch2013_en.htm\">European Social Innovation Competition</a>.

(This video changed my life and helped me to understand the role of the 'happy hormones': <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfBWtovxYQY\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfBWtovxYQY</a>)\n\nWhen I started participating at Edgeryders, I was drifting. I had a (vague) idea about the nature of the Universe. I met other participants, and they helped me think and refine my thoughts and vision. I developed a great friendship with a philosopher (<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/michel-filippi\">Michel Filippi</a>) and it is a fullfilling fantastic experience. Last Fall, I felt isolated, I was looking for other people like me. Thanks to the Edgeders project, I recently discovered a community that fits my needs (the <a href=\"http://www.icrcanada.org/\">Institute of Consciousness Research</a>). Recently, I met people in Los Angeles, and I am in the process of helping this group build communities and look at ways to develop worldwide collaboration. All this happened via my participation with Edgeryders.\n\nSo, I encourage you to keep following your intuition. It always tels us the right thing to do (although sometimes we think it might be inappropriate and crazy). Keep listening! Also, using social media to connect to others that share similar interests, being active members of online communities, will keep you growing and learning.\n\nPlease keep me informed about what you are doing and the discoveries you make. Let us connect on Twitter (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Lyne_Robichaud\">@Lyne_Robichaud</a>).\n\nHave a look at this mission report from Michel Filippi, and let us know what you think.

Participants with a similar mind and skillset need to go through an application process to enter. Organizers pay a careful attention to selecting people who want to be there to make something happen and not just learn or raise funds.\n\nSponsors and investors also take part although their identities are not revealed. This is to ensure that ideas get kickstarted and I love that particular component there :)\n\nWhere could this evolve if the meetups are thematic, if young people start addressing concrete issues and come forward with solutions to real local economic, social, political and cultural challenges? This can easily end up being an awesome way of building our networks, improve our skills and learn from peers right then and there.\u00a0\n\nThe reason for me to giga like this initiative is that it is opening up a space for local innovations, local changes and local collaboration!

You help everybody install the app on their phone resp. hand one of the pre-loaded phones to those that don't have a smartphone. Finally you pull out your own phone, pull up your app and hit a big green \"Start\" button ...\n\nThe app immediately jump-starts a flourishing local economy by asking its members some questions about their resources, skills and needs and by connecting them to each other with a toolbox of alternative economy tools: sharing economy solutions, LETS alternative currency, community gardening, planning algorithms for a micro-economy, a P2P reputation system and more.\n\nFor a more detailed writeup on a similar idea that is a precursor to this one, see <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/local-resource-infosystem\">The Local Resource Information System</a>.\n\nInvolved actors: Matthias Ansorg for Android app development; an academic institution for scientific advice (to be determined); and a pilot user community (to be determined, current proposal is a self-governed social center (CSOA) in Spain).\n\n<strong>How is this idea innovative?</strong>\n\nContext: There is already a lot of ideas for how to run an alternative economy in economic crisis and depression, like the one experienced in Greece, Spain and Portugal these days. The range is from LETS local currencies to all kinds of sharing and collaborative economy solutions like ride sharing (side.cr), renting unused private space (AirBnB) etc.. They still fail to reach a significant role in a national economy, or in individual lives \u2013 which is mostly due to network effects (the \"critical mass of users\") problem.\n\nInnovation: This project is about making a local alternative economy work not by inventing new mechanisms for it but by integrating the existing ones tightly enough and making them accessible enough (on free smartphones, if necessary) so that a real, working, self-sustaining system will result, not a set of unrelated parts that lie around like an unassembled machine. The ubiquitous, web-connected smartphone app (in addition to a normal website interface) seems like the best way to implement this, and to our knowledge, it has never been done or tried.\n\n<strong>How will your idea have an impact? How will you measure your impact?</strong> (Explain how your idea will have an impact on helping target people/groups move towards work or into new types of work. What is it about your idea that will achieve this?)\n\nTarget group: Economically deprived people in EU member states who are technically literate enough to operate a moderately complex smartphone application. This covers nearly all unemployed youth, and there are a lot of them (official latest youth unemployment rate from Spain for example is 52.9%).\n\nThe intended impact is a big increase in these people's compensated economic activity \u2013 like tenfold. It's compensated, so not just about writing hopeless job applications. But it's not compensated in legal tender \u2013 instead, it's a new kind of work. It provides the same benefits of economic activity like an employee job however, namely to support and improve the lives of the workers and the surrounding society. So there's an impact, but GDP is the wrong measure for it. Instead, we measure the \"internal GDP\" of the alternative currency used by this app, and how it increases. Also we measure people's individual economic situation with a questionnaire that is handed out before the start of the economy app, and regularly after it, and answered within the app itself.\n\nFinally, there can be an impact on business creation: generally speaking, running a business in such an alternative economy is legally possible as long as it documents its alternative currency trades with invoices issued in legal tender, and earns enough legal tender alongside to pay its taxes with. That's how trade exchanges work, which is \"bartering for businesses\". Now being able to do business ca. 70% in alternative currency is great for a business, because the alternative currency does not have the liquidity issues of legal tender in times of depression: it can be created by everybody \"out of thin air\" by a mutual agreement on debt (\"IOU\"). Which means that a lot of tax-paying small business startups can arise from such app-initiated, local economies.\n\n<strong>At what scale will your idea operate initially and how do you think it can be implemented in another EU member state in the future?</strong>\n\nThe app (the smartphone software implemented for this project) will be developed together with one community that uses and evaluates it and provides feedback. But at the same time, it will be provided online as free and open source software, together with an extensive \"operator's manual\" on how to start and maintain a local economy with it (jurisdiction dependent sections of this manual have to be contributed once there are experiences with similar projects in other EU member states).\n\nThis intends for viral self-replication in all EU member states and beyond. If the idea is sound and works indeed, it is expected that it will spread quickly because of the economic necessities in Europe's crisis areas (compare the LETS alternative currency systems, counting ca. 300 projects in Greece as of 2012 because of the economic crisis, and even though LETS alone does not provide the full potential of a local economy because it omits sharing features etc.).\n\nViral self-replication will be supported by some public relations activity: making the system known in the target group, which is as simple as spreading the idea via social activist news and project networks (like n-1.cc).\n\n<strong>How do you think your idea could be sustained over the next five years?</strong>\n\nAs an economy-system, this project intends to achieve permanent self-sustainability more or less immediately after deploying the first ready-to-use version of the economy app in a community.\n\nThis also includes support for the app's further development by involving open source developers and alternative currency donations from the different local economy communities using this app.\n\nHowever, a local economy group can also disband. This will happen not too rarely, as is the case in all small / grassroots economy projects, for example due to leadership issues. Sustainability beyond such an event will be provided by allowing the members to re-group immediately into other or new local economy groups. And by ensuring that the app software development is performed independent of the support of any one local economy community.\n\n<strong>What are the most important things to have in place to make this idea happen? If there would be 20k EUR cash money available for it, how would it be used?</strong>\n\nImplementing the app software and a founding a first local economy community needs at this point: funds to support an Android software developer (who can be the person behind this proposal) for ca. 6 months while programming the initial version of the app; a group wanting to try the software for setting up a local economy; and some smartphones.\n\nAdditionally, some scientific advice would be very much welcomed. This could be organized by making this project a third-party funded PhD thesis in computer science.\n\nCash money would be used like this: (1) 6000 EUR for supporting the initial version's development during 6 months' equivalent of full-time work; (2) 4000 EUR to acquire ca. 50 used Android smartphones for use in the initial local economy; (3) 10 000 EUR over 2-3 years for various expenses to refine the software and to promote its adoption in other communities. This can include conference attendance and on-site training for new local economy communities. The cash money will only be used where the task cannot be done with the alternative currency donations from within the local economies (which can be spent for translation, documentation authoring etc.).\n\n", "created_at": "2013-01-29 15:27:42", "updated_at": "2017-10-08 16:52:01.073827", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1410, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 48.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24152, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 1109, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2012-05-12 17:57:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-12 18:26:20.753527", "deleted_at": "2017-07-26 13:16:16.820569", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19529, "user_id": 398, "topic_id": 1303, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Hi Ronan,\n\nfirst things first,</b>\n\nHi Ronan,\n\nfirst things first, 'Dia dhuit a chara, is Eirineach mise freisin, b\u00ed ullamh'. \"There are wolves these seely sheep among!\"\n\nI have a lot to say to you, I can see you are in the right place heart-wise, next is to get headwise about what and how to do what you are setting about.

I suggest you contact Noreen of Winset, the Irish Socail Enterprise society before their funding and activities wrap up in May. She will be able to help you and there are courses there in the main Ws (and the odd H) of these issues. {I mean the Whats and Hows and so on}. Noreen has a good heart and you being in Dublin will be useful to you as the regional remit of their funding means they have to focus on the Dublin Meath region and can't help people like me outside of that area. One course, in how to write a business plan for a social enterprise, starts in March.

In this country people are unaware of the tidal nature of our shared time here, if you hope to make an effect you will have to focus and use the contacts and the support offered to you, make the connections, the rest will happen, don't let time escape you, whether using it to achieve the ten thousand things, or to clear your mind and relax, integrate awareness and breathe, remember to focus your awareness, its a relaxed thing when you get the hang of it. Get as much feedback from like-minds as possible. Do not be afraid to be strong and lead where that is the appropriate thing to do, but remember that water, though percieved as weak, is the greatest strength, its persistence wears the rock away, and so when time and place calls for it- go with the flow, follow, take advice and criticism reflectively and see from multiple angles. This will help.\n\nTo the issue of what you are trying to do I have some few issues to address. The European Union is currently devising budgetary plans to createe a knowledge and innovation economy in Europe. In what you are trying to do you have the chance to get the drop on a student connective body that spreads awareness. In the next five years the newcomers on this scene will be full of pre-ordained agendas. This puts your teams movement into a very good position. At present the Irish universities are run as disparate private enterprises, education industries of a kind, and so they are set within a very specific context - one of competition. It is against the competitive context, divisive in nature, to form connectives and so your work is to overcome the contextual setting. The students are all in university to learn and share skills, devise solutions, create wholesome careers and lives for their futures and so on. granted a lot of people get lost en route with aspects such as RAG Week (one reason I question the name of your organization).\n\nPeople do not understand the nature of change, order and complexity in social and organizational interaction. Objective information exchange is the key. Inthis process information is taken in, modified according to environment/experience/context, and given out again. By this process all forms of human endevour develop their cultures, information systems, organizations etc. The student body is no different. It is interesting to note that the function of concentration, whether individual or collective, is the organization of the information that is the subject of focus. In a bunch of mathmaticians the function of the collective concentration is to organize the abstract entities into complex structures that approximate a certain modality of existence. In some very interesting tests it hasbeen proven that the ability to maintain concentration over the course of a very very long questionaire perfectly correlates with the highest achievers in the math section of that questionaire. Do you see what this means? It means that the one who can concentrate for long enough will naturally be the best at math. Math is the organization of absrtact symbols, packets of informatio, that assemble into structures approximately, sometimes exactly, the nature of reality.\n\nWhat I'm saying here in relevance to the student body is that it doesn't make rational sense to cut down the nodes of possible information exchange within a learning system such as a network of national universities. by competing with one another they shut down their capacity to save on mental energy, two heads are better than one! The competition between universities is up at the higher level of the institution, as a result of this the student body suffers. It is in the shared interest of the student body to form their own organization via a national connective students union and club/society structure that operates at the level of information exchange rather than the locational 'on campus'.\n\nFor example, as part of the juggling soc. in NUIG I saw that they paid a pro-juggler 600\u20ac to fly in, teach, perform and leave the next day. The jugglin soc. in Cork said they'd have loved him to come along, as did many in the Dublin Universities. If the funds had been collectively leveraged the use of that money could have gone so much further for everyone and instead of having one or two such learning experiences per year the student body could have collectively self-facilitated with a full annual programme of events without spending extra money but rather by organizing their spending. I am sure this applies to the AV society, the dance soc, , etc,etc,etc, any crew with a shared value system obviously share interest in what benefits them as a group. This is only one very concrete and pertinent example. Of course there are so many more, research and development, the publishing of research papers, better R&amp;D , patent forming and so on all will be spurred on by increasing the rates of information exchange in a collective system...i.e a fancy way of describing what you are working on.\n\nI agree Ronan, we are a disenfranchised generation. Our wealth has been pinched from under our noses by our own parentage...nationally speaking. adhering to the politically metaphoric it can be said that our guide and ruler, the father, has lived in usury of the son. It is time to change that, never loosing sight that we are working toward providing a better future for those coming after us. My battery is about to run out and so I have to cut this short. I will be meeting Noreen in Dublin for cofee next week, perhaps you would like to join us?\n\nAll the best friend,\n\n\u00c9iimh\u00edn\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-28 15:09:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:48.898531", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1328, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5886, "user_id": 3367, "topic_id": 5853, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<blockquote>\n\n<em>\u201cA Resolution\u201d points to the sparks that are creating a new light in the growing darkness: the revolutionary wave that spread from Tunis to New York; the Kurdish freedom struggle and the war against ISIS in Rojava; the riots and blockades sparked by the killings of Mike Brown and Eric Garner; and the retooling and remaking of life with \u201ccivilization starter kits\u201d and \u201cremoving the dust\u201d from indigenous knowledges and practices. \u201cWe, the people who work every day, who think we \u2018don\u2019t have time\u2019 - we are the only ones who can do this,\u201d said a Woodbine co-founder. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to do this for us\u2014no politician, no technological innovation, no international agreement.

It is part of Woodbine, a hub for building autonomy in the wake of a dying civilization.</h2>\n\n<strong>Our goal is to examine what health autonomy would look like and how to begin to build it for ourselves here in New York city</strong>. We are beginning by providing ways to interact with neighbors, to think of health and care as a communal process, and becoming a point of aggregation where people can come together and share resources. We currently facilitate health related skill shares, create concrete ways to navigate the overwhelming health infrastructure that exists while lessening our dependence on it, in order to build an autonomous health community.\n\n<strong>We are beginning to experiment with providing care outside of the realm of state control.</strong> This practice may involve working outside the structure of licenses, certifications and insurance. Our intention is always to heal, and so we are finding ways to do this that protects providers and patients.\n\n<strong>Within Woodbine, the struggle for autonomy has been broken down into categories of the most urgent material necessity, meant to focus our attention on tangible goals toward building power within our community.</strong> Health autonomy is a crucial part of this. The health resource center is run by a mix of health professionals and those with informal training in various health practices. <strong>We want to re-create a sense of agency over health through a focus on the dissemination of usable, teachable skills.</strong> We are working with peers who practice herbal medicine, massage, feldenkrais, acupuncture, meditation, yoga and other forms of so called \u201calternative\u201d medicine. We are creating our own definition of wellness, one that is congruent with the realities of our time. There is also a large<strong> focus on prevention of illness, of re-fostering the idea of a healthy life, not merely the absence of disease.</strong> This is how we begin the necessary process of r<strong>emoving our physical and mental health from systems that would damage them furth</strong>er, to reclaim control over health and use it to increase our collective autonomy.\n\nWe do not reject modern methods of medicine, but recognize the need to detach its knowledge from the oppressive institutions that guard it. <strong>We are attempting to change our orientation to institutions of western medicine to one of use over dependence</strong>; a manipulation of the systems that surround us. While there are significant problems with the city\u2019s public health infrastructure, they do provide much of the emergency and chronic care here. <strong>We realize that there needs to be support for people needing to navigate these without the fear of accruing a huge amount debt, alongside the emphasis of practices that will ultimately lessen dependence on them.</strong> The spaces dedicated to holistic medicine or alternative care are largely inaccessible to large portions of the population because they exist for those who can afford them. For these reasons, our center is meant to involve community members, help us understand the care-related skills we already have, and be an informational resource for accessing all types of health modalities. We have public open times for the community, staffed by one of our members, to assist in that process.\n\n<strong>Our skills workshops so far have included basic first aid, wound care, acupressure and intro to traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and an intro to medicinal plants.</strong> Coming up <strong>we will have workshops on navigating existing healthcare systems, nutrition, addiction and ongoing fitness skillshares</strong>. <strong>Our goal is that participants can use the resource library to learn about things relevant to their own health</strong>, potentially explore different modalities, and either receive aid in navigating the health systems in place or find treatment within the space itself.\n\nAs we gain ground in the journey towards health autonomy, <strong>we see just how disempowered we have become when it comes to being able to give and receive the kind of care necessary. We have to fight that disconnection</strong> and build the infrastructure in order to give ourselves the space to envision a new existence. <strong>We look forward to hearing your stories, to understand your struggles and to collectively create the foundations to answer these monumental questions.</strong>\n\n<em>\u00a0Editor's note: We\u00a0are building a\u00a0collaborative bid for the MacArhur Foundation's 100 Million USD with our peers in 40 + countires.

My impression is that English has become very widely spoken as a second language in many European countries. There are some exceptioms. like Italy and Spain (I have a mixed impression of France, where I live now); but overall Europe - including Eastern Europe - now has a shared <em>lingua franca.</em>\n\nThis process has greatly increased the importance of English as a connecting, enabling tool. At the same time, it seems to have depreciated other languages somewhat. I speak reasonably good Spanish, a bit of German, but I hardly ever use them (Spanish a little more); after moving to France I taught myself some French, but even living here the incentives to get better at the French language are not really there. Once you can do your groceries and make small talk in French, once you can understand a written text... well, then you end up doing most of your reading, video watching etc. on the Internet, and most Internet content is in English (unless you read Mandarin, which I don't).\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-03 12:04:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:53.148219", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 196, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 4, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8681, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 3946, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>I'm joining :)</b>\n\nI'm joining.

How are you?</strong>\u00a0Social change is messy, and burn-out is often the cost. The unMonasterians will be asked to measure their levels of wellbeing, and make sure they have routines that allow for some version of the five ways to wellbeing and proper sleep.\n\n<strong>2. Do you feel part of a community?\u00a0</strong><a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/action-research-centre/community-and-public-services/connected-communities/mental-wellbeing-and-social-inclusion\" style=\"color: rgb(67, 130, 147);\">RSA Connected Communities</a>\u00a0work has really highlighted the importance of feeling part of a community, of feeling accepted where you are.\n\n<strong>3. Do you feel supported?</strong>\u00a0It is important to know that you can go to others when you need, and our social connections are often the first thing to suffer when we move around. Even for those who live in Matera full-time, their new focus could disrupt those social connections that currently help them feel well.\n\n<strong>4. How are you and your project linking in to the local area?\u00a0</strong>This is the big mama of the questions. Even if our unMonasterians are happy, bright eyed and bushy tailed, without real local engagement unMonastery is a spring-break, not a new way of working. Using<a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/action-research-centre/community-and-public-services/connected-communities/what-are-networks\" style=\"color: rgb(67, 130, 147);\">\u00a0social network analysis</a>, and possibly linking to unMonasterian\u00a0<a href=\"/u/lucia\" style=\"color: rgb(67, 130, 147);\">Lucia</a>\u2018s walking ethnographies, we will be tracking who the unMonasterians are working with, how this changes, and if this goes beyond the existing contacts of our contacts.

Introduction](#heading--1)**\n**[2. Project Management 1\u00d71](#heading--2)**\n**[3. Project managers and the Edgeryders company](#heading--3)**\n\n------\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. Introduction</h2>\n\nWe need to get better at coaching project managers. This starts with clear instructions about what (to us) is obvious but won't be for n00bs or people who have not worked in corporate environments. For example, don't get stuck \u2013 if you feel things are spiralling out of control or that the collaborators are getting anxious / irritated call for help.\n\nSo I thought we can aggregate what we learn from mistakes into a shared wiki that then is shared with everyone the Edgeryders company signs up as subcontractors. It should also be included in the contract as an annex that they have to sign.\n\nBelow are some suggestions to get us started with such a project management manual. Please edit where you see fit.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Project Management 1\u00d71</h2>\n\n1.  **Please keep in mind that your client is the Edgeryders company** as represented by the person who signed your contract and you report directly to that person. When we work with external clients, we are in _corporate space_ \u2013 the Edgeryders company has taken legal and ethical responsibility for delivering the promised results. This means you are expected to respect  a non-negotiable hierarchy where the responsible Edgeryders director is \"the boss\".  You have to get the Edgeryders directors written approval before interacting directly with the external client. This includes any phonecalls, emails, messages in any channel including social media. \n\n2. **Remember the most expensive cost of business is building relationships.** We are trusting you with a relationship that a lot of care has gone into building. Our expectation is that you behave gracefully and honestly with the directors of the Edgeryders company and all collaborators and subcontractors. Your job is to make sure everyone's expectations are harmonized before the kickoff of the project. As well as to be responsive, quick and focused on solving problems that arise at all times with grace. If possible, try to make people feel good about dealing with you and about themselves...a lot of the time when someone hires you to do something it's because something went wrong earlier in the process with someone else and they're going to be nervous. Especially if they are working with Edgeryders the first time. If you are not 100% sure about something say you will check, get the answer from the Edgeryders director in charge, and get back to them. Make sure you do get back with a verified answer within 24 hours. Remember, it's kind of like dating: not knowing is the worst part :)\n\n4. **You commit  to adopting the Edgeryders distributed collaboration workflow and work out loud ethics from beginning to end of this project.** This means you commit use the Edgeryders platform (set up a group and add team members on it, and communicate/coordinate work through posts, tasks and wikis) from day one. You are also responsible for describing to anyone you involve in the project how we are going to work and what is expected of them for a successful project outcome. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the platform and work routines before starting the project. Read the user manual and contact the directors for help if you need it.\n\n4. **Your main responsibility as project manager is to make sure all deadlines are respected.** This applies both to our deadlines towards the client and their deadlines to give us agreed upon materials or resources. Make sure that we deliver everything in time, and as soon as you get any signs there may be delays you must communicate to the client in writing that we need to push back an agreed upon deadline. Give clients clear guidelines for what is expected of them on which dates  (ideally give them templates if possible). Make it clear that the consequences of their not doing those things in time is that they take responsibility for jeopardizing our ability to deliver a high quality, timely and successful project.\n\n5. **What clients want to know is how you are going to fix the problem. Period.** They want to know you are on top of things at all times. This never means lying or obscuring the truth. Just having a credible plan and keeping them up to date with how things are progressing. Remember, clients are not interested in excuses for why you cannot do something and they are definitely not interested in whining.\n\n5. **OH NO! SOMEONE FUCKED UP!! What do I do?** When things go wrong, ideally when you first start to feel things are not running smoothly **ask for help immediately!!**. There are five directors Matthias Ansorg, Nadia EL-Imam, Alberto Cottica, Noemi Salantiu and John Coate (with some limited support from Patrick Andrews). Their job is to support you and other community members. So write them and ask for help when you are uncertain or need help with a client project: firstname@edgeryders.eu\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Project managers and the Edgeryders company</h2>\n\nIf we on the other hand see you are struggling with any of the above (e.g. if a client or subcontractor complains) this is how we deal with it:\n\n1. We let you know what is happening and have a chat about how to fix it\n\n2. Where it is super urgent we will just ask you to get certain things done to fix the problem\n\n3. Take over the project management if we feel you cannot handle it. \n\nIn extreme cases we may be forced to cancel your contract with the Edgeryders company if we perceive that your behavior is jeopardizing the project or our client relationship. This is something we really don't want to have to do because it is bad for everyone, so please help us help one another by taking the guidelines above seriously.", "created_at": "2014-09-19 11:28:40", "updated_at": "2019-03-06 16:29:16.818424", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1021, "wiki": true, "reads": 13, "score": 24.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19312, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3027, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Changing your mind is honourable</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/ben\">@Ben</a>, \"assume good faith\" goes for me too. I don't think there is any evil or lazy person at work here. So of course we all take it for granted that you \u2013 and everybody else, in the house and outside \u2013 are working towards the common good. You <em>never</em>\u00a0heard any personal negative comment from me, about <em>anyone, </em>not even in private.\u00a0So that's out of the way, I hope. :-)\n\nThe governance configuration was always a point of divergence between you and me. You have your quotation, and I have mine: the <a href=\"/the-unmonasterian-s-expectation-management-primer\">unMonasterian's expectation management primer</a>, which we wrote together as a part of the application package, states:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<div>The role of the unAbbott is designed as a service to the community; whatever actions he takes, he will do so to forward that goal. You are expected to work with him by taking his advice very seriously, <strong>even if that means occasionally putting the well-being of the community above your own</strong>. If anything troubles you in your experience in the unMonastery, talk to him and he will try to sort you out. Conversely, should you come to be perceived as harmful to the work and peace of mind of other unMonasterians, the unAbbott is entitled to suspend your per diem and ask you to leave.</div>\n\n</blockquote>\n\nSo that's hierarchy for you \u2013 hierarchy\u00a0<em>as a service,</em>\u00a0as intended in Benedict's Rule. We went down your way \u2013 rightly so, because you are there and I am not. But this does not make me any less faithful than you to the original concept.\n\nI completely disagree with your point about alienation, which I have to put down as a rhetorical move. Please, don't do rhetorics to me: we are both looking for the truth. I get it wrong often enough, as it is, no need to employ additional weaponry. Acceptance of Protocol (or the Civil Code of Law, or some religious text, or Benedict's Rule) could indeed be alienating\u00a0<em>if they were encoded into mighty power structures</em>\u00a0that crush individual creativity yada yada. But the unMonastery is a vanishingly small little experiment. It has no power and almost no money. We asked people to come though the door,\u00a0<em>conditionally to accepting the rules of the game.\u00a0</em>How is that alienating, when people can (1) not come (2) leave if they have already come, at no cost (and in fact at some benefits, given the modest life led in the house) and (3) talk to the unAbbott if they are troubled? Is it really too much to ask that they don't engage in politicking?\n\nIt comes down to this: the unMonastery was given a mandate (the famous 12 challenges) and plenty of latitude on how to go about it. If you are happy about the way it's turning out, just do your thing. However, I have the very strong feeling that you are not happy \u2013 based on several requests to step in that @Nadia and I personally have received over the months. The latest, that prompted this post, was from <a href=\"/u/bembo_davies\">@Bembo Davies</a>\u00a0by email this very morning. If that is so, just remember: we are rational people. If facts contradict our way of thinking, we change our way of thinking. It is not too late to do so, and if you need someone to take the blame for an unpopular decision, I am ready to take it \u2013 in love, believe me. Either way, we will have a very interesting discussion at the end of the story!\n\nAs I said before on several occasions, I am not ready to move into the house in any way that would be helpful to solving the present crisis, though I was hoping to spend some time in Matera in July.\n\n<a href=\"/u/lucia\">@Lucia</a>, your point is well taken. Relationships and sharing experiences are definitely something you can show with pride, and therefore count as results. You personally have been conducting your work flawlessly: I routinely quote <a href=\"http://luciacaistor.tumblr.com/\">your Tumblr</a> as an example of what high-quality documentation looks like. But again, that goes for most or all unMonasterians individually: it is the rules of mutual interaction, not the individuals, that seem to produce tensions. \u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-22 13:23:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.654460", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 778, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15121], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18226, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 1580, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>The Idler and other thoughts</b>\n\nMy uncle occassionally writes for a magazine called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idler_%281993%29\">The Idler</a>.

I have often found myself at well intentioned workshops with rooms full of professionals working hard at designing perfect interventions that will deliver the miraculous \u2018product' of health to our communities. I\u2019m intensely frustrated by the waste of human resources and energy when surely it must be obvious that health is not simply the output of professional \u2018interventions\u2019 (even the clinical language makes me recoil). Surely it\u2019s obvious that health is also fundamentally the natural outcome of healthy communities, relationships and systems - including our political and economic systems.\u00a0\n\nThe work I'm involved in\u00a0at GalGael came out of fires protesting motorways bringing asthma and nature deprivation to communities in Glasgow already hard pressed. We created relative safety admist a housing scheme where there was little.\u00a0We learnt along the way - by accident - the sense of agency that comes from \u2018the act of sharing responsibilities\u2019 within the context of the encampment. We chose to continue to work with that sense of agency and still do so 20 years after the motorway was built. We\u2019ve continued learning and particularly the extent to which that sense of agency is profoundly connected to our health. We\u2019re lucky in Scotland to have had a recent Government Chief Medical Officer who underlined the importance of work on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salutogenesis\">salutogenesis</a> - the importance of studying what makes us healthy rather than disease itself - and the role that our sense of control over our own lives plays in our health; both physical and mental. (Harry Burns - I believe he is regularly in NY)\n\nFor a while we were disheartened to see people we\u2019d worked with on issues of addiction appear back at our doors. What were we doing wrong? We were adamant that we did not want to be another revolving door for people stuck in the cogs of a poverty industry or disease factory. Slowly we realised - by classical 'analysing our own reality' - that the systems and relationships beyond our doors and beyond our direct influence were considerably more effective at creating disease and dysfunction than we could ever be at resolving it - especially on grant funded (frequently cut) project work, creating environments where people could find greater health and humanity. And now we know the imperative of both - to be there when people need us on the renewed understanding that many diseases and social ills are adaptations to the dysfunction in our wider systems. On its own, this would amount to little more than sticking a finger in a crack in the harbour wall in the face of a tsunami. So now we understand that working to influence system change is also essential to not only the health in individuals but increasingly the survival of our communities. I find what Deborah Frieze refers to as\u00a0'<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/17907928\">hospicing the\u00a0dying</a>' in relation to systems\u00a0helpful - an important aspect of care work in our times. What is called for as old systems collapse? How do we work to illuminate and support the emergence of the new?\u00a0\n\nThese thoughts\u00a0led to me proposing a track for the Open Village - <a href=\"/t/theme-session-proposal-architectures-of-love-policy-vs-culture-in-creating-the-conditions-for-opencare/6271\">see more here</a>. If you are delivering a session - I would love to hear more and stay in touch as the programme shapes up.\n\n@Noemi - happy to come across your link.

It seemed like a crazy idea at the time, most monarchs and rulers around Europe had already turned him down. They too could have just said: \"<em>Sorry old man. We are not giving you a penny</em>\". Or imagine a world in which powerful countries like the US didn't spend almost 3% of their GDP on R&amp;D, trying to develp - alas - new weapons most of the time, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet\">but occasionally life-changing technologies, like the Internet</a>. Imagine a world in which innovations of all sorts didn't rule our world, and innovators in business (like Richard Branson), in music (like the Beatles), in technology (<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/11/14/111114fa_fact_gladwell\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; \">like Steve Jobs</a>)\u00a0or in the arts (like Giotto)\u00a0weren't hailed as heroes. Well this would be a pretty dark world, close to what the Middle Ages looked like, ruled by supersticion, fear and disease. I have often argued that our ability to come up with inventive and creative solutions to the constant problems and challenges that surround us is probabily our most reassuring trait, one that gives me hope for a better and brigther future.\u00a0\n\nNow, who is better placed to come up with a lasting solution to a problem than the very person who is affected by it? Obviously, no one. The best example in this sense is still the one of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/speakers/william_kamkwamba.html\">young William Kamkwamba</a>, a boy who, in order to power his family's home in Malawi, built an electricity-producing windmill from spare parts and scrap. He became world-famous and I am not sure whether he is still pondering how to come up with brilliant ideas, but you get my point. Inside everyone of us there is an innovator who will do his or her best to make the world a better place. In other words: a social innovator.\u00a0\n\nThis is not the place for me to enter into a discussion about what social innovation really is. If you have 2 minutes, you can watch <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/8793259\">this brilliant video</a> by Social Innovation Exchange (SIX) which gives you an excellent idea of it all.\u00a0On the surface, it's a win-win solution. Citizens (us) become more involved in their communities, come up with great ideas to make the world better, and everyone's happier at the end. Everyone seems to be talking about social innovation these days. The UK Government's Innovation Agency (NESTA), for example, has just launched a nation-wide campaign called <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/home1/assets/features/britains_new_radicals\">Britain's 50 New Radicals</a>, which will celebrate \"<em>the inspiring people or organisations that have come up with ingenious, practical and scalable ways of tackling challenges in areas such as health, education, unemployment, aging, community regeneration and wellbeing</em>\". Other nations are becoming interested, and even large corporations like <a href=\"http://dellchallenge.org/\">Dell run annual competitions</a>\u00a0to find innovative solutions to some of the world's greatest challenges.\u00a0\n\nExcept: this isn't really how the story unfolds. At least, it wasn't in my experience and in the experience of a lot of social innovators I know.\n\nWhen I started <a href=\"http://milan.the-hub.net/public/\">The Hub in Milan</a>, I arrived with a solid idea that had already been tested in other countries and that was working well: creating a shared workspace and cultural centre promoting social entrepreneurship and social innovation by connecting people and helping them develop new projects and ideas for a radically better world. It was having a social impact, it was creating social value, and it was also sustainable from a financial point of view, being based on a business model that had been implemented successfuly in other European cities like London and Amsterdam. True, there were some cultural differences, Italians are not like the Dutch or the English, prone to work in open spaces and to collaborate, but evidence suggested that these cultural differences were not going to sink the project.\u00a0\n\nI started fundraising for the social start-up I was launching. I went to foundations, to corporate sponsors, to the public sector, to investors and to social venture capitalists. I wrote and re-wrote business plans, answered countless emails detailing all sorts of things, went to endless meetings where everyone kept saying what a great project this was, how excited they were about its arrival in Italy, although unfortunately they were not in a position to fund it. One after the other one all doors were closed. On one occasion, I remember a group of venture capitalists telling us, once the space had already been launched: \"<em>Guys, we are not going to give you money, but please keep inviting us to your parties and events, because they are great and we like the vibe in here</em>\". I had no words.\u00a0\n\nLong story short: I went to my family and told them: I need you to invest in my idea. And my family supported me. I did what the great majority of social innovators (and general innovators) do: I turned to one of the 3 Fs: Family, Friends and Fools, notoriously the only ones who will support risky (and in this case non-risky) start-ups.\u00a0\n\nThis wasn't only my experience. It echoes the story of so many other social innovators I know. My friends Augusto and Matteo over at <a href=\"http://criticalcity.org/home/landing\">Critical City</a> had the most extraordinary experience ever, being promised EUR 100,000 by a group of VCs, only to be told - once the cameras were off - that it wasn't true. They eventually got a grant from a large foundation, but not before they had stretched themselves thin trying to keep the project afloat with their own personal resources (and probably with some help from their family). It's not just a Southern-European problem. My friend Karen recently launched a brilliant project in London,\u00a0<a href=\"http://beta.ekologi.coop/\">Ekologi</a>, a\u00a0noticeboard for social change that makes it easy to find funding, facilities, contacts and support. Again, it was her husband who helped her out, not NESTA, social investrors or grant-makers.\u00a0\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.cartoonstock.com/lowres/aba0138l.jpg\" style=\"width: 373px; height: 400px; \">\n\nWhat does this tell us? It seems to me that while there is a lot of talk about supporting grassroot initiatives that are innovative and socially-relevant, the funding channels are still dry or geared towards the \"usual suspects\". But isn't this exactly the opposite of what social innovation should be about? Shouldn't we start breaking the boundaries and walking away from the beaten path, by supporting outsiders, leftfield creatives, crazy \"Cristopher Columbuses\" who might just have the right idea about the shape of the world? Or at least should we not recognise the role that personal networks play for us social innovators and give recognition to them, for example through tax breaks? My idea, for example, is that when a person invests 10,000 euros in a start-up social enterprise or a socially-innovative project that has the potential to improve our society and world, they should be able to deduct this amont (or part of it, depending on whether it's a loan, a grant or an investment) from their taxes. This would be a far more realistic reponse by policy-makers to a de-facto situation in which funders and investors are mainly talking about supporting social innovation, while the burden of forking out the cash is stil on us, our families and our friends (and the odd fool).\n\nA little social innovation in the policy world could really change the lives of millions of people. Policy-makers: what are you waiting for to really support social innovation?\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-23 12:26:45", "updated_at": "2017-08-25 17:44:55.817143", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1427, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 86.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8918, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2646, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Exactly that!</b>\n\nHello Muhammad, welcome.

We kept concluding that simple, corny, all-powerful love was the only way to make a community work when it is diverse, thus guaranteeing friction, and at the same time committed to free expression, which can and does get out of hand. <strong>A core of people must flat-out believe in the possibility of community and keep coming back to that amid the emotional storms in order for the whole loosely coupled group to hold together at all</strong>. When you complicate the situation with the real-life courtships and marriages and divorces and affairs and breakups that tend to happen to the same cohort of people when they stay in touch over a number of years, you have an atmosphere that can get overheated at times.\" [emphasis mine \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.rheingold.com/vc/book/2.html\">source</a> ]</em>\n\nAnd I thought: man, this is it.

Having professionals work with and educate kids and adults about equality, fairness, stereotyping, prejudice, scapegoating, gaslighting, etc is always a good thing. Workshops can be good if they are welcomed to a place and there is a strong willingness for them to happen.\n\nGetting these important subjects onto school curriculums would be a very good outcome. I created an app in 2001 \"Seeing Sense\" that became part of the curriculum in the schools in Northern Ireland, when working with Mark Willett Design Associates. It was a usefull educational tool, but education is just a part of the solution. Changing attitudes and culture takes more. As you've said organising and getting the conversation going at a community level is key, and getting famous/successful people to champion the cause would be a big help. And professional counselling service for individuals effected by these issues would help straight away, and also would be usefull along the journey as yet unknown challeges will surely appear.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-08 21:41:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:53.583532", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 176, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12348, "user_id": 2694, "topic_id": 5246, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Ok so it's an issue of planning</b>\n\n@alberto any preferences when you'd like to have this session so that the OpenCare crew can join?\n\nShould we save it for Sunday?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-11 09:58:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:10.487748", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 38, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11013], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6466, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 6433, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2f429fd413b58d1c62b30c6c2c6710d09e798857.png\" width=\"646\" height=\"180\">\n\nThis week at Edgeryders, @WinniePoncelet discusses putting together a program for OpenVilage that makes sense within the constraints of community management, proper funding, legal frameworks, patents and more.

I used to deal with structurally similar situations, when I was the director of a government initiative\u00a0supporting creative projects in Italy's Mezzogiorno.\u00a0The Italian govt\u00a0placed\u00a0a high priority on enterprise/job creation in the south. We had plenty of money. And yet, the more we tried to \"do it right\" (we\u00a0chased\u00a0fledgling entrepreneurs in small villages and underprivileged areas, we put money on the table), the more we found ourselves talking to, somehow, the wrong people. Monetary incentives brought out the sharks. Targeting vulnerable groups fostered an unhealthy relationship, with the people in question assuming a dependent relationship.\u00a0Reciprocal, inclusive, sure, but how?\u00a0\n\nIn practice, we ended up doing two things. They did not constitute an elegant solution, but it was a decent hack.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>We refused to hand out any money. We could, and did, point to many initiatives funding creative projects. We pointed out that, for people to want to pay for your ideas, you need to do up front work to make that idea clear and robust, and we could help with\u00a0<em>that.</em>\u00a0We were offering a free service, and keeping it separated from the actual funding. We did do a challenge, with a monetary reward a year. I think the small amounts in OpenCare are very much in that tradition: they signal respect, but are not big enough to distort incentives. In the startup scene, incentives are\u00a0<em>very</em>\u00a0distorted \u2013 there are even <a href=\"http://kefuturo.com/post/143586199216/startup-fallisce-allinsaputa-del-founder-era-a\">jokes about it</a>. But the dark world of \"incentivi alle imprese\" is no joke.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>We focused on what you call \"pushing\" only in the very first step of the engagement process. We would go out of our way to go where the creatives (whatever that meant) met, to make ourselves available and encourage: but after that, we would allow people to self-select. The rationale is this: like my project of 2008,\u00a0<em>OpenCare\u00a0</em>does not need to appeal to absolutely everybody. It needs to appeal to\u00a0<em>the people that build the care services</em>\u00a0which, then, will appeal to everybody. The Helliniko Metropolitan Community Clinic was not dreamed up by long-term unemployed Greeks: the first mover was a senior\u00a0doctor in Rhodes. The clinic itself, though, is open: not only it targets unemployed people, but it allows them to help run it.</li>\n\n</ol>", "created_at": "2016-05-04 11:38:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:39.528550", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 455, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16215, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3427, "post_number": 3, "raw": "thank you @danohu ;)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-09 15:18:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:30.934711", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11201, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4355, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>There's a reason for the blush-emoticon...</b>\n\nthough to be honest I spent most of the time looking through the discussions.

And I see the issue as two fold. One is that organizations have difficulties to frame issues and their 'proposals' in ways that speak to or is decodable by the many. The second (a corolary) is some potential 'cultural' misunderstanding between organizations that come from various angles and perspectives on how things should proceed and be prioritized that prevent effective collaboration although ultimately similar outcomes are sought out. Last week I had the opportunity to discuss with people from Occupy London and they outilined how difficult it was to keep cohesiveness between various currents and trends in particular as far as language and process is concerned and they were looking forwards to working on building bridges to resolves this...\n\nThis is probably a 'grand' long term project, but I think that people in the communication/linguistic/intercultural-intersubjective/organizational fields who span over various modes of functioning/processing/speaking could come up with some effective ideas.\n\nTo answer your last question, I do not have any comprehensive [re]source right now. We are working to build it from the seminars.

People do work to make a living. Others do work to make meaning. But the two works are not the same work.\u201d </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>The unMonastery is an ambitious and radical response to the challenge of bridging this gap. It draws inspiration from the 10th century monastic life to encourage radical forms of social innovation and collaboration. A sort of lay, off-grid mendicant order striving for a society that can better withstand present and future systemic crises.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nThis place-based social innovation, is aimed at addressing the interlinked needs of empty space, unemployment and depleting social services by embedding committed, skilled individuals within communities that could benefit from their presence.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nThe unMonastery aims to develop a new kind of social space, akin to co-living and co-working spaces, drawing influence from both Monasteries and HackerSpaces, with a focus on the process of co-creation and co-learning between the community and unMonasterians. </span></span>\n\n<span><span>At the core of the unMonastery concept is a desire to recreate the best social functions of the traditional monastery: by giving the participants a collective purpose, a chance to develop deep relationships with one another and a reduced need to generate personal income so time can be dedicated entirely to serving the local community and contributing to global efforts in creating new digital tools.</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Fact Sheet: </span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>The unMonastery is a </span><span>Non-Profit</span><span> project that aims to challenge existing dependency chains and economic fictions. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>The unMonastery was developed in collaboration with EdgeRyders LBG, over the course of 18 months. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>Edgeryders started out as a project by the Council of Europe and the European Commission, which after termination developed into an international community run social enterprise. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>The unMonastery as a whole is defined by the place in which unMonasterians gather - and is not tied to a physical geographical location. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>The unMonastery aims to establish a network of spaces throughout the world, which will work together but autonomously to prototype new solutions to common problems. \u00a0</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>The unMonastery is heavily indebted to the concept of HackerSpaces and borrows parts of the model to build an outward facing space that engages closely with its local community. \u00a0</span></span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>unMonastery Matera. Prototype \\#1 - Summary: </span></span>\n\n<span><span>The first prototype of the unMonastery is being built as a brave experiment in one of the oldest human settlements in Europe, the \u201cSassi\u201d cave-dwellings in the historical neighbourhoods of the city of Matera in Southern Italy. Now recognised as the first UNESCO world heritage site of southern Italy. Matera, candidate city for the European Capital of Culture in 2019, is sighted by the unMonasterians as the natural birthplace for the unMonastery Prototype due to its deep relationship to early monastic orders and the role that monasteries played in past centuries. \u00a0<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nThe gambit behind this collaboration is that living side by side, hackers and Materans discover and explore new paths to make the city more participative, open and resilient to future crisis.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Key information about unMonastery Matera!</span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>unMonastery Matera is the first prototype of the unMonastery project, it is a brave experiment that aims to change the way in which we live and work together. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>It is an international/worldwide project with a 200 years </span><span>projected</span><span> history - which believes in long term development over short term solutionism. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>The unMonastery prototype brings 14 unMonasterians to gather in Matera - with individual projects designed to tackle existing social problems specific to the city. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>The unMonastery aims to build bridges in Matera through a series of initiatives and partnerships with existing associations.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>This prototype is designed to create a baseline model for the unMonastery that will enable rapid start-up and replication in other locations throughout the next 200 years. Each iteration aims to improve on the last. \u00a0\u00a0</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>CheFare</span></span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span><span>What does unMonastery Matera offer to the city\u2019s citizens? </span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>From the 1st of March the unMonastery will operate an open door policy and encourage all the citizens of Matera to come and join us in our skill sharing sessions, workshops and collective experiments. This will be marked by an opening ceremony on the 1st of March.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>The first series of workshops and skill sharing sessions at the unMonastery will include; Programming and Computer Science, Open Source Hardware Development, Basic Woodworking Skills, Live TV and Radio production, Film Making and Introductions to Open Source Software - this will expand as more unMonasterians join us in Matera. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>unMonastery Initiatives:</span><span> </span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>unMonastery Analytics and Open Financing: </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>We\u2019re working with existing initiatives to develop news ways to track and reduce the use of natural resources consumed by the space - with help from the Open Energy Monitor and Open Banking Projects. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>unMonastery Radical Transparency:</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>The running of the project is based on developing a culture of radical transparency, with a desire to make visible all aspects of the process, including finances, decision making, individual profiles, energy use in order to set example for how other institutions might benefit from a transparent approach. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>unMonastery OSM Challenges:</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>With a desire to support the Open Street Mapping Matera group in their efforts to create a free and detailed map of the city - unMonasterians will offer themselves up to map areas of the city specified by the citizen of Matera. This could include; dumped rubbish, disused buildings or broken street lamps. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>unMonastery Sustainability Plan vs Business Plan</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>The unMonastery isn\u2019t interested in developing a business plan but instead a strategy towards sustainability focused on reducing dependencies from the monetary economy: obtaining the use of unused buildings, growing food and reducing energy consumption. Core to the prototype\u2019s development will be the creation of a Sustainability Plan that can be used by other groups.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>unMonastery Open Partnerships; </span><span>aims to share the resources and opportunities it has with associations, institutions, groups and individuals based in Matera. We actively encourage existing groups to approach us and work together with us to establish new perspectives and projects throughout the city. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>unMonastery Open Space Initiative; </span><span>as part of the early development of the project, the unMonastery is intensively documenting the process for making use of disused property in Matera, in order to enable those living in Matera to create their own projects and make use of otherwise wasted spaces and resources. \u00a0</span></span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Individual unMonastery Projects:</span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>Lucia Caistor-Arendar:</span><span> developing an asset mapping tool which enables current and future unMonasterians to embed their projects within the place they are working, through the creation of \u201cwalking ethnographies\u201d with people living and working in Matera. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>David Bovil:</span><span> unMonastery Radio and the Festival of Growing.

I did not know you could be so eloquent.\n\nSome of you know I have been asked to help a small city in Southern Italy, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matera\">Matera</a>, to prepare a bid for European City of Culture 2019. My role would supposedly be to make the bid \"more cutting edge\". They are working on the concept of making the city \"editable\" by its inhabitants, like a wiki - in fact they are asking me because, in Italy, I am associated to decentralized, wiki-style governance models (I wrote a book about it, long story).\u00a0\n\nI think the Unmonastery would be a fantastic enabling factor for a local community, and I would like to ask the good folks in Matera if they would be up for doing an experiment. Maybe they can find a place where 15-20 people can live, and a little money to give them bed, board, connectivity and pay a modest salary to some Unabbott or Unabbottess to give the evolving community some stable point of reference. So, unless you really object to me coming into the picture, I will just show them this report and tell them a little about the conversation and make my opening gambit. I can make no promise: maybe they will say no; maybe they will say next year; maybe they will have slightly different parameters in mind from the ones spelled out by Edwin, six months as an experiment rather than a year, or something like that.\u00a0\n\nThe city is absolutely beautiful, UNESCO World Heritage (it is the location of Mel Gibson's <em>Passion</em>), and I can guarantee the Unmonastery would not go unnoticed - it's small enough. Another bonus: good governance. If some unmonk or un-nun comes up with some brilliant idea and can show a prototype, it is not out of the question that the city or the Region (who are collaborating closely on the bid) might like it and ask the person to deploy it.\u00a0\n\nDo I have your blessing?\n\n<img alt=\"Matera, seat of the Unmonastery?\" src=\"http://www.gerrypacher.ch/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Matera_P8_9590-Gerry_Pacher.jpg\" style=\"width: 512px; height: 320px; \">\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-20 17:45:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:55.215485", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 391, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6447, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 6414, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2b1da2797227c8c5c466c15c411f766bf7529879.jpg\" width=\"498\" height=\"225\">\n\nThe <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-to-work-with-the-world-bank-on-social-innovation-in-the-mena-region/6384\">big news from last week</a> is our announcement of a contract partnership with the World Bank to set up a peer to peer support based space in the Middle East and North Africa region.

I think that there are many suffering in Africa because of the unaffordable, inaccessible, and inadequate health care system, and I think that in order to keep the tolls of death low, perhaps people don\u2019t need to wait for a revolution to the health sector, maybe what we need is an easily accessible, and affordable health alternative. Because of the many polluted rivers, African children die daily from diarrhea. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention tells us that 2,195 children die EACH DAY from diarrhea. Due to the unaffordable health care system, many diabetic sufferers die without receiving proper medication or medical attention. Hence, many African countries like my country, Nigeria, have one of the highest diabetic sufferers and deaths.\n\nMy name is Ivan Ezeigbo. I am 20 years old, and currently a sophomore at Minerva Schools at KGI, California, USA. I was inspired by Monica Marcu\u2019s book, The Miracle Tree, to research with a team back in Nigeria on the blood regulatory power of the contents of the leaves of a very medicinal plant. It is a herbal plant that has just drawn a lot of attention in its potential to cure over three hundred ailments. This is the Moringa Oleifera. We experimented on Wistar albino rats. The idea was to inject alloxan intraperitoneally to all groups of Wistar albino rats with healthy working pancreas (alloxan increases blood sugar level, thus inducing hyperglycaemia or making them \u201cpseudo-diabetic\u201d). The bioactive agents of moringa leaves were extracted with ethanol and water, and two groups of the rats were treated each with these contents. An additional group was treated with synthetic insulin (insulin is a natural blood regulatory hormone that brings down blood sugar level), and all three groups were observed. We discovered that the group of Wistar albino rats treated with the bioactive agents of the moringa leaves extracted with water had a SIGNIFICANTLY SIMILAR blood sugar level as those treated with synthetic insulin, and less significant with those treated with ethanol. This unearthened two truths. First, moringa has powerful blood regulatory effects, almost equivalent to the natural insulin. Secondly, water is a better extraction agent than ethanol, unlike the case for many other plant leaves. Aside its blood regulatory power, moringa also cures diarrhea, and many other bacterial and fungal infections. It is also a healthy store for numerous nutrients, vitamins and amino acids. It also thrives very well in these tropical regions of Africa, especially the Southern Nigeria. Armed with this knowledge, I took up the entrepreneurial project of making moringa teas using tea bags because this would not only help a lot of poor people in Nigeria, and Africa in general, who cannot afford or obtain quality health care, but would be a cheap and accessible way of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, since water is a good extraction agent for moringa, moringa teas would provide consumers the maximal health benefits. Even though, I have not had the necessary funding and have been self-funding this project, my motivation to help people live longer and healthier has kept this dream going, and I have not tired out in bringing this to fruition. I am still conducting researches and experiments on my tea, and I have just purchased about two plots of land for moringa farming. I would still need to set up an industry where these teas will be processed.\n\nThis is good news to diabetic sufferers in Africa; it is good news to poor children and families in Africa who cannot afford quality health care. This is good news to hypertensive patients and the obese. This is good news to Africa. My dream is that this project greatly lowers mortality rate in Africa, and if we are not being too optimistic, perhaps...just perhaps, we may begin to realize stronger development.\n\nA link to the paper we published on the experiment with Wistar albino rats: <a href=\"http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.diabetes.20160503.02.html\">http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.diabetes.20160503.02.html</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-25 12:12:58", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 13:57:20.646406", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 737, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 40.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12886, "user_id": 854, "topic_id": 4082, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Folder/document access rights</b>\n\n<span>Good morning Nadia,</span>\n\ncould you please add my address as well? marco[AT]scimpulse[DOT]org\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-12 08:28:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:13.118917", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 43, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12483], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31679, "user_id": 1996, "topic_id": 2961, "post_number": 24, "raw": "<b>Thank you!</b>\n\nThanks and looking to see you all in Tbilisi. :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-10 12:20:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:54.153003", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20664, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 6243, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Looking forward to it! </b>\n\nSounds awesome, @Federico_Monaco .

You can check it out here: http://pad.telecomix.org/vefdinak", "created_at": "2012-07-31 14:17:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:56.715367", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 126, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1756, "user_id": 13, "topic_id": 1723, "post_number": 1, "raw": "In my mission proposal (http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/help-build-edgeryders-p2p-school-resilience/mission_case/mission-proposal-greece-learning-situation) I brought up an old idea of mine, to perform a study tour throughout Greece. The goal is to learn about self-governing movemenst &amp; communities in Greece, hardly known to the Europena public. Most of cameras and minds are focused on Athens - and this is just a fire show, while in shadows real life is thriving.\n\nThe output of this mission will be threefold:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>a documentary (or several of them), addressed to the broad public, showing Greece behind the fira and smoke of Athen riots.</li>\n\n<li>some articles (perhaps a book?) describing the emerging self-governed societies and intentional communities at their best: replacing ineffective state system at the grassroot level.</li>\n\n<li>a network of contacts (or maybe online community) to link Greek communities with international supporters and activists to let spread the Greek lesson wherever it may be needed.</li>\n\n</ul>Since publishing this idea here, I have had several conversations and received many comments and messages on it. For sure, several things need to change:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>One small team is not enough to cover substantial part of the issue, and just couple weeks is too short to see that many places we may need.</li>\n\n<li>We need a good documentary movie project to offer to a decent TV station, if we want to make it doable.</li>\n\n<li>Crowdfunding will be essential - this way or another - so we neeed a good promo clip. :)</li>\n\n</ol>The bottom line is\u00a0 WE NEED PEOPLE! We shall have to form probably three teams, each one with it's own camerapeople, writer and contact maker. If we add 2-3 people for the 'ground support', we shall need 15 people, ready to spend couple months preparing and running the project the lowcost way.\n\nHere in Poland I am talking to a group of 6 people, including 4 movie makers. There will be some more invited to participate. I invite all of you, who want to get involved. The first goal is to form a group and to make a project out of the idea - of course through participation and consensus method.\n\nOnce we have the project defined, we shall go for funding. And that will be our reality check. From then on, hopefully, we shall just fly high :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2><strong>OK, who's in?</strong></h2>\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-11-14 12:14:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:08.702696", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 431, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28963, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4465, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>What effect?</b>\n\n\"<em>But for me this was one of the best sites I have used so far - in terms of this effect.</em>\" \u2013 What do you refer to, does this mean that content post forms here on edgeryders.eu don't work for you frequently?

Although, at the moment it's still quite challenging for politicians here in Belgium to change the cultural mindset of opening up to public/private/citizen partnerships. Hence why some initiatives have been at grass roots level with the community itself. I sincerely hope this will change over time.\n\nI have linked to many of the UK BIDs and they have been incredibly supportive. Also, recently in Edinburgh there was the World Towns Leadership Summit, in which one of the organizers was BIDs Scotland along with IDA of Northern America. It was incredible to hear the stories of what some of the partnerships had indeed achieved in their communities. From Capetown to Copenhagen, it was quite an eye opener.\u00a0\n\nI hope you don't mind if I reach out to you, with your experience and knowledge of the BIDs in your area in the future.\n\nThanks again!\u00a0\n\nRozina\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-17 11:33:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:06.432155", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 204, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7852], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3550, "user_id": 2299, "topic_id": 3517, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**_Available in: :gb: [English](#en) / :ru: [Russian](#ru)_**\n\n----------\n\n## :gb: **_English version_** <a name=\"en\"></a>\n\nI want to inform everyone that Edgeryders have entered the Belarusian territory and will be supporting and working together with UNDP Belarus within their Spot the Future program. I will tell you more about myself in the next blog, first let me explain what Edgeryders will do in Belarus, why they will do this, and what my role is in this initiative.  \n\n<strong>UNDP\u2019s mission: </strong>The UN facilitated an inclusive national consultation process to identify priorities for the Post-2015 development agenda In Belarus. The consultations were an open dialogue with special emphasis on vulnerable groups. Urban and rural dwellers, women and men, academia, civil society organizations and minority groups, private sector and trade unions could get their voices heard and envision a future they want for themselves.  \n\nUN recognizes that citizens have valuable knowledge that is currently under-used when planning and designing projects, strategies and development interventions. They also may have additional advantages that UN agencies lack, e.g.  living in a certain region or having access to certain information.\n\nIn addition, both UN as a whole and UNDP are investing more on youth engagement.  For instance the soon to be published UNDP youth strategy embraces youth as a positive force for transformative change and encourages country offices to develop initiatives to enhance youth civic engagement and participation in politics and economic sphere. The initiatives can either build on good practices of the past or introduce innovative solutions for the future.\n\nUNDP Belarus is taking the challenge seriously to engage youth more successfully in designing projects, strategies and development interventions. Belarusian youth should to be building the society they want for themselves. Here, traditional ways of engaging the public might seem outdated and the need to design more up-to-date and innovative solutions needs to be recognized. \n\nThe next question would be, how to engage citizens to communicate to UNDP Belarus both the issues they are facing and the solutions/initiatives they are already have to address those? \n\n<strong>And this is where Edgeryders comes in:</strong> with their Spot the Future (STF) methodology, a foresight exercise that connects social innovators in the participant countries and engages them in a global conversation to figure out the challenges and solutions together. Spot the Future methodology in Belarus will start with a series of Blogs that will be written by me, Masha Cheriakova, about a number of social innovators in Belarus. I will dive in the edge of the society and do field work, identify and plan meetings with social innovators. I will be writing about their stories, what they are doing and why. Also I will touch upon what barriers they face and what they need in their efforts to improve Belarus for the better. In addition to identifying these local change makers and the collection of their stories it is important for us and UNDP to ensure that these voices of different societal groups will be heard and used for formulating the second UNDAF and UN programs and projects in Belarus. We also aim to broaden the dialogue between citizens in Belarus, between citizens and UN and between citizen and the public sector.\n\n<strong>Lets start </strong>with this new Edgeryders adventure in Belarus. Enjoy the blogs and please don\u2019t hesitate to ask or add any comments! It will be my pleasure to answer any question or accept any good advice!\n\nPs: Special thanks to Kseniya Sidorovich for her help in translating this blog into

I guess we will be speaking about this for a long time\u00a0<img alt=\"smiley\" height=\"23\" src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png\" title=\"smiley\" width=\"23\">.\u00a0\n\nJust one note that I cannot resist adding right now: development work is about reproducing artificially what happened spontaneously somewhere else (eg. Southern Germany, or the Silicon Valley). This means introducing an element of design and command-and-control to drive a complex system in a way that will mimic the emergent behaviour you like. \"Design for emergence\" is a paradox, of course, and has many consequences.\n\nYour notion of sequencing (agricultural surplus first, then civil society development) is closer to engineering than the biological metaphors that I prefer to employ when I think about this stuff. Engineering metaphors make things appear simpler than they are. For example, the insistence on civil society development, in this space, comes from the experience of putting a lot of money into creating initiatives that were captured by powerful vested interests leaning on weak, corrupt, unaccountable governments. So the \"right sequence\" was wrong, too. This is because, when you are trying to build stuff in the social world there is very likely no right sequence: it's chicken-and-egg problems all the way down.\u00a0\n\nThis may sound paralysing, but it is actually not. Reason: you can employ the powerful concept of subgame perfect equilibrium (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgame_perfect_equilibrium\">formal definition</a>). The intuition is: each step of the way makes sense in and of itself, without needing to be underpinned by the final grand goal. Father Cassian Folsom's critique of the unMonastery (this will not work without God) can be interpreted in that way: a monk's avocation is subgame-perfect, because as they learn to live in a community in relative peace (which is really hard), they get immediate reward by serving God. On the other hand, a lay person trying to do the same in an unMonastery will have to motivate herself without such immediate reward, until the community is finally stable. So, says Father Cassian (translated in the language of game theory), the unMonastic path is not subgame-perfect.\u00a0\n\nIn development, sequences need not be \"right\". They need to be subgame-perfect.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-23 14:23:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.322372", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 412, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12971], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12172, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5990, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Asset mapping vs. need mapping</b>\n\nThe \"beginning of the sentence\" format is a clever one, @Moushira .

Once in the open, solutions will learn from each other and imitate tricks from each other and eventually you will have... better solutions.

I want to get into the community management side of this website and I\u2019m currently involved in an internship with @Noemi (thanks, btw, for the opportunity :D ). I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m here and I can now start getting informed about the REAL world, as I want to be as close as possible to learning to understand its circle and mechanisms, to be in harmony with it and maybe even influence it during my growing process. I\u2019ve seen that lots of young adults (people of my age) have these things in mind (which is relieving), but they just can\u2019t find the right opportunities to express their needs and wishes when it comes to this (just at the moment, I hope). This may cause them frustration and the emphasis on the general \u201cI feel so lost and useless\u201d kind of thoughts (very common, I see). We, young people, just have the inclination to overthink stuff and aspire to do something as big as possible in life, some of you (and even of us) might say.\n\nMy name is Andra, I\u2019m 16 years old and I like to consider myself a \u201cfull of personality little flower\u201d. This actually says a lot about me, as I\u2019m young, fresh, always natural and with a delicate aspect; but I\u2019m also capable of lots of things. The list of experiences I am able to face and I actually did is increasing, along with the progress I make during my own lifetime evolution. Do you want to know what makes my little metaphor even cooler? The answer is very simple, but maybe a bit unexpected: the fact that I actually know all of this (and much more) about myself! This gives me the power to bring myself together and continue being as I am or trying to be as I aspire to be, as I actually know my person quite well to understand how much I am able to handle and try to work this all out.\n\nMaybe now it\u2019s the proper time to refer to the \u201cbut I can see the intelligence and potential from your look\u201d kind of clich\u00e9 people often tell me. I feel like I had to mention it, considering that hearing it so much made me think about it as a kind of true fact about my personality. It\u2019s true, I\u2019m smart. I may not jump into doing a lot of activities, but the ones I assume are done with passion and ambition. My hobbies are diverse, but there\u2019s nothing that gives me more pleasure than making connections between the knowledge or the abilities I own after doing them. I enjoy comparing the past and the present and thinking how much it influenced the actual world, as I absolutely love History (and analyzing, I can see) \u2013 I\u2019m studying social sciences at high school with a strong reason. I find funny comparing Chinese and Japanese ( I learned 2 years of Chinese and summer 2016 got me having Japanese classes). I also enjoy comparing guitar or bass techniques from well known songs, as I am a bassist in a girl band and I\u2019m trying to get as good as possible for our concerts and my own satisfaction (which is hard to please).\n\nBut doing something for yourself is not enough when you live \u00a0surrounded by people and depend on them, even a bit. Sharing your knowledge and abilities with the others is so important, especially when they can help you improve your skills and express yourself in a better way. I think that getting involved into the Edgeryders activity may help me a lot with this.\n\nI want to leave a mark (significant when it comes to a community\u2019s one).\n\nI want to do something productive, to get rid of teenagers\u2019 typical existential crises and that \u201cblind alley\u201d sensation.\n\nI wish to be more organized, to bring myself together well enough to bear my expressed (I hope) opinions and perspective and put emphasis on them when I\u2019m in the proper circumstances to do these.\n\nI aspire to grow in the spirit of openness, responsibility and honesty Edgeryders\u2019 community (for example) promote. To me, this is a way better influence for young people (and not only) than the nowadays teenage culture.\n\nI\u2019m sure that I aspire to be and do other things, too. They don\u2019t have a clear form for now, but the time and my growing experience will help me out with that.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-08 09:24:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:33.187920", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 841, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13665, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3150, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Nah :-)</b>\n\nI think broken English is underrated.

But two questions/comments arise for me:\n\n1. I humbly submit that one of the fundamentals at issue here is size. The EU is simply too big to be able to dispense either economic stability or much-needed political responsiveness at anything like local, or even national, level. The EU is a utopian project based on yesterday's values: growth, big is beautiful, economic liberalisation and political centralisation. These are the dogmas of the late 20th century, the dogmas that got us here and we as Europeans are going to have to abandon them if we want to get out. Here is a little piece on Leopold Kohr \u00a0which expands on this a bit:\n\nhttp://www.paulkingsnorth.net/journalism/this-collapse-is-a-crisis-of-bigness/\n\n2. \u00a0Related, slightly, I take issue with this observation:\n\n<blockquote>' ...if you\u2019re in a vulnerable group, and you have an EU passport, perhaps now is the time to consider moving north to the extremely well-organized and disciplined countries where Winter can kill you and so people work together and plan to survive it every year ...'\n\n</blockquote>So people should be leaving their own countries, their families, their homeland, all of their cultural links, the place they were born in and grew up in and the culture they are part of, and they should be moving to countries with which they have no connection, whose language they probably do not speak and in which, in times of crisis, people may not welcome immigrants \u2013 because, as we all know, it's foreigners that get blamed at times of crisis, in this period in history as in any other.\n\nI submit that this is not good advice; I also suggest that it does not take enough account of the subtleties and intricacies of human belonging. It may make sense on a spreadsheet, but in reality one of the best ways to weather a crisis is surely to be part of the community that will look after you, not to be a stranger in a foreign city where people will be suspicious of you. There is a really good article on just this subject in the second Dark Mountain book, which takes apart the myth of survivalism and suggests that rooting yourself in a community is probably your best bet.\u00a0\n\nhttp://dark-mountain.net/stories/books/book-2/\n\nThis is not to say that there is not a good case for getting out of cities: there probably is.

I have my own small collection of horror stories of the same kind. In my native Emilia Romagna, a very industrious and wealthy region, the regional government has startup grants for entrepreneurs, but they need to be... unemployed! When you tell them that any entrepreneurial person, especially in an area that was doing very well before the crisis, would probably be juggling two or three odd jobs while she gets her own business going, they shrug and blame the EU. Or the Italian negotiators that, in getting the Framework Programme in place with the EU, earmarked all the funding to fight unemployment, so that even business creation has to come from unemployed people. Even to bid for such a grant, with no guarantee of winning, you have to close your personal business: this can be a problem now, because the new government is giving good fiscal treatment to young self-employed professionals, but if you close your personal business and then reopen it again all of these facilitations are gone.\n\nRidigity is paramount in government. In some areas it is essential, but in business creation, I would argue, it is a very serious liability.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 21:11:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:45.049296", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 212, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13123, "user_id": 268, "topic_id": 1332, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Thanks</b>\n\nIt was functional when I first gave it to you Lyne.

If you go the traditional startup route, each of these stages require monetary investment. The more investment, the more pressure to earn big profits, exploit user data, skew your users' experience for profit, etc...</span>\n\n<span>If you decide to build an open source community, many of these monetary investments are drastically reduced, or non-existent. However, trying to guide a community requires careful thought, planning and execution (just ask <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a> or <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>)</span>\n\n<span>More people are willing to engage at a higher level and get involved in building the process if they see that a) the goal of the project is aligned with their own goals and b) the main organisation/developer can be trusted and has a commitment to the community.</span>\n\n<span>This commitment to the community starts with an open source license. This says '<em>I trust and respect the community and I hope my work can be of value to them</em>.' It tells the community '<em>if you have a great idea, <strong>you already have permission</strong> to try it out</em>'.</span>\n\n<span>It allows others to build businesses around and upon the core project, which in this case perfectly mirrors this project's bigger goal - allowing people to make a living doing what they love. An open license also gives the community some insurance - in the worst possible scenario, if you go rogue and turn the project into something completely contrary to the project's original goals, people can still fork the project or at least customize it to suit their needs.\n\nOf course the license is just the start, there is a lot more which can and should be done to show your community you're trustworthy and to engage developers, users etc. But I won't get into that here.</span>\n\n<span>Secondly, the standard you're 'competing' against, the CV, is ancient, and spread throughout every sector of the economy.\n\nA proprietary approach to taking on the CV (LinkedIn for example), might be where one company creates one standard for everyone to use, or perhaps different versions and flavours of the core product depending on perceived interest / use cases / potential revenue from different demographics. LinkedIn has the business community down, sure, but it's completely useless for many creative industries, subcultures, etc. But who cares, those sectors aren't profitable, right?</span>\n\n<span>Well, in an open source environment, different users and communities can take the original product and adapt it to suit their needs, however niche. Their improvements are also published under an open license for others to use. This has the nice side effect of serving as a highly unpredictable but surprisingly effective extra R&amp;D department for any business built around the open project.</span>\n\n<span>\u201c<em>designing for openness allows others to answer the questions that you don\u2019t have the answers to, but its greatest power may be that it allows others to ask the questions that you haven\u2019t even thought to ask.</em>\u201d Roman Mars, <a href=\"http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/episode-23-you-are-listening-to/\">99% Invisible</a>.</span>\n\n<span>And what if there are other companies/organisations with the same or a similar goal to you? You all expend energy competing against one another, building your own walled gardens and duplicating each others' work writing distinct proprietary code which largely does exactly the same thing as everyone else's. And eventually one winner emerges, regardless of whether it suits everybody's needs, or if it's technically the best possible solution. The other businesses wither and die, and the successful business gets sold to Facebook/LinkedIn/Google for 10 billion dollars.</span>\n\nI<span>'m sure there are other people/companies with similar goals to you, and with the right coordination, you can collaborate on areas where you share goals, and have more time and resources to focus on finding your own niches and services to specialise in.</span>\n\n<span>In <span>Yerevan </span>I mentioned the idea of looking at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordpress\">Wordpress</a> ecosystem as a template, to think about a possible ecosystem which could develop if you designed this as open source - many different businesses doing customisation and services, contributing back to the core project.

Un 1/3 secteurs qui a souvent une origine grassroot.\n\nLe t\u00e9moignage que j\u2019aimerais apporter est celui de ces acteurs de premi\u00e8re ligne pour qui le monde tel qu\u2019il est sont tant d\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de se r\u00e9aliser en tant qu\u2019individu et qui cherchent aujourd\u2019hui humblement \u00e0 \u00eatre <strong>acteur de changement </strong>d'un temps o\u00f9 tout s\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e8re.\n\nLes valeurs que je porte et que j\u2019ai essay\u00e9 de synth\u00e9tiser dans l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 d\u2019une fonction sur une carte de visite sont celles d\u2019acteurs agiles. <em>Lean </em>signifie que l\u2019on passe par des it\u00e9rations avant d\u2019inventer un plan tr\u00e8s complet et de se projeter dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de toute une strat\u00e9gie. La notion de <em>st\u00e9r\u00e9o</em> revient pas mal \u00e0 la mode avec toutes les avanc\u00e9es faites dans le monde de la captation 3D. La R\u00e9alit\u00e9 Virtuelle (la VR) comporte pas mal de facettes dont la st\u00e9r\u00e9oscopie existe depuis la cr\u00e9ation de l\u2019\u00e8re cin\u00e9matographique.\n\nPour en revenir au sujet Change Care, j\u2019avais toujours eu le sentiment d\u2019\u00eatre capable de faire bouger des choses dans ma r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Le challenge \u00e9tait de voir si je pouvais <strong>changer d\u2019\u00e9chelle</strong> et amener ce changement \u00e0 une plus large mesure dans mon environnement. Il y a une bonne ann\u00e9e maintenant les choses se sont mises en place et j\u2019ai pu me lib\u00e9rer de la contrainte de travailler pour un projet, \u00a0pour un boss, ou pour une structure. Je travaille aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 trouver des projets dans lesquels je trouve des <strong>leviers</strong> pour valider des hypoth\u00e8ses tout en apportant de la valeur intrins\u00e8que aux porteurs de ces projets.\n\nMon approche est assez simple, les hypoth\u00e8ses que je souhaite valider sont toujours plus ou moins du m\u00eame ordre. En tant que citoyen et acteur de terrain, suis-je capable de d\u00e9crire et d\u2019amorcer suffisamment un projet pour en faire un sujet lisible pour un environnement qui se situerait \u00e0 la crois\u00e9e des 3 secteurs que sont: le <strong>Secteur Priv\u00e9 (SP), les Pouvoirs Publics et le Monde Philanthropique (MP)</strong>\n\nAujourd\u2019hui ce que je pensais possible, ce dont j\u2019ai longtemps cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 me lib\u00e9rer: \"la <strong>contrainte de faire pour</strong>\", me semble accessible et j\u2019aimerais que d\u2019autres puisse trouver cet espace d\u2019expression. Je travaille \u00e0 rendre cet \u00e9tat de fait et cet \u00e9tat d\u2019esprit visible chaque jour. Aujourd\u2019hui je peux faire avec, je peux choisir les missions dans lequel je souhaite investir du temps et surtout j'ai trouv\u00e9 un \u00e9quilibre, certes fragile, mais qui me permet de me dire que tout mon temps, je le concentre \u00e0 <strong>faire le Monde</strong> tel que je l'imagine.\n\nJe ne vous raconte pas l\u2019histoire d\u2019un gars qui quitte son boulot parce qu\u2019il est en <strong>burn out</strong> ou bien le parcours d\u2019un type qui n\u2019en peut plus de sa vie dans le secteur priv\u00e9. Je ne vais pas non plus narrer l\u2019histoire d\u2019un <strong>travailleur social</strong> \u00e9puis\u00e9 par une logique institutionnelle et administrative pesante. Qui, jours apr\u00e8s jours, limite et an\u00e9anti la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019actions possibles d'acteur de premi\u00e8re ligne, fatigu\u00e9s de r\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes du quotidien tout en luttant pour faire reconnaitre l\u2019essence m\u00eame de <strong>l\u2019action sociale</strong>. Faire sens.\n\nIl s\u2019agit ici de livrer le\u00a0 t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un d'entre deux, d\u2019un acteur capable de passer d\u2019un cot\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019autre du miroir. De passer du priv\u00e9 au public juste pour <strong>donner sens \u00e0 sa qu\u00eate</strong>.\n\nL\u2019exp\u00e9rience de travail et la s\u00e9quence professionnelle que j\u2019aimerais partager prend place \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 je travaillais chez un courtier sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en assurance construction. J\u2019y g\u00e9rais les dossiers clients. Nous travaillions dans un r\u00e9gime de 40 heures par semaine et j\u2019avais donc droit \u00e0 un jour de cong\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire par mois. Ce qui m\u2019en faisait 12 au total sur l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\n\nCe boulot de courtier \u00e9tait clairement en dehors de ma zone de r\u00e9flexion mais permettait une vrai stabilit\u00e9 et une <strong>bascule</strong> vers le secteur priv\u00e9 qui allait affirmer une capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 faire ce <strong>switch associatif/priv\u00e9</strong> que je trouve int\u00e9ressant dans mon profil.\n\n<strong>12 jours</strong> donc soit \u00e0 prendre en cong\u00e9s, soit \u00e0 investir dans quelque chose qui faisait du sens. J\u2019ai donc eu l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition en Belgique du <strong>Programme Impact de Ashoka</strong> (www.belgium.ashoka.org/programme-impact). Je suis devenu <strong>coach</strong> d\u2019un projet qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent en France, en Espagne en Irlande. Le <strong>Groupe Associatif Siel Bleu </strong>(www.sielbleu.org) est une organisation qui propose de <strong>l\u2019Activit\u00e9 Physique Adapt\u00e9e (APA)</strong> aux seniors. Et le projet que j\u2019accompagnais s\u2019appelait <strong>Gymsana</strong> (www.gymsana.be) en Belgique.\n\nNous avons eu la chance d\u2019\u00eatre laur\u00e9at du Programme Impact en 2013. L\u2019enjeu du programme \u00e9tait de faire changer d\u2019\u00e9chelle les 12 projets inscrits au travers d\u2019un programme de 3 mois.\n\nMa mission \u00e9tait vraiment ax\u00e9e sur la mise en place de <strong>process de travail</strong> visant \u00e0 fluidifier l\u2019activit\u00e9 sur le territoire belge. Le mod\u00e8le \u00e9tait un copi\u00e9/coll\u00e9 du mode de d\u00e9veloppement pratiqu\u00e9 en France par les intervenant en APA. Au niveau de l\u2019encadrement des activit\u00e9s, Siel Bleu disposait d\u2019un <strong>mat\u00e9riel p\u00e9dagogique et de formation </strong>tr\u00e8s riche qui \u00e9tait mis \u00e0 notre disposition. Par contre la difficult\u00e9 en Belgique venait des <strong>sources plurielles de financements </strong>et de la <strong>complexit\u00e9 \u00e0 les articuler dans un budget coh\u00e9rent</strong> sur les 3 r\u00e9gions du pays.\n\nSiel Bleu s\u2019est fait remarqu\u00e9 et est devenu <strong>Fellow d\u2019Ashoka</strong> gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 proposer une <strong>mesure de l\u2019impact</strong> des activit\u00e9s que les intervenants proposaient. Je d\u00e9couvrais la notation de Social Return On Investment (SROI) et la capacit\u00e9 motrice et d\u2019inspiration des Fellow, sorte <strong>d\u2019ambassadeurs du changement</strong> capable de <strong>storyteller</strong> leur histoire et de <strong>provoquer l\u2019adh\u00e9sion</strong> des <strong>parties prenantes du projet</strong>. Cette validation scientifique a tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t \u00e9t\u00e9 le point fort de Siel Bleu et les APA on tr\u00e8s vite convaincu les instances europ\u00e9ennes ainsi que le commissaire fran\u00e7ais Michel Barnier. Le Groupe a connu une <strong>forte croissance</strong> et a, petit a petit, acquis le respect gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de proposer une alternative en terme de rupture avec les standards actuels de prise en charge des personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es. Principalement pour la maladie d\u2019Alzheimer et de Parkinson. Mais \u00e9galement pour les diab\u00e8tes de type 2.\n\nDans mon parcours plut\u00f4t riche, j\u2019ai appris aux <strong>Petits Riens</strong> (www.petitsriens.be), un asbl belge qui lutte contre la pauvret\u00e9 et l\u2019exclusion qu\u2019on pouvait <strong>revaloriser la seconde main</strong> pour <strong>cr\u00e9er de l\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique</strong> et <strong>financer des actions sociales</strong>. Chez Gymsana, j\u2019ai mieux compris comment on construisait un discours et des outils pour impacter un secteur et proposer des <strong>solutions innovantes</strong> et <strong>disruptives</strong> par rapport aux standards existants.\n\nDurant la <strong>phase de transition</strong> qui s\u2019installe et qui aura pour horizon une <strong>p\u00e9riode de 20-30 ans</strong>, j\u2019aurai eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019assister, je le pense, \u00e0 la mutation d'un monde associatif partant <strong>d\u2019initiatives locales grassroot</strong>, vers des <strong>entreprises d\u2019insertion</strong> \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un mod\u00e8le de financement le moins d\u00e9pendant des pouvoirs publics, l\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale. J\u2019ai ensuite vu ce secteur \u00e9voluer lorsque sont apparus des <strong>entrepreneurs sociaux</strong> qu\u2019on appelle aujourd\u2019hui des <strong>ChangeMakers</strong>. Ils sont capables de mesurer l\u2019impact des efforts qu\u2019ils\u00a0produisent sur les sujets auxquels ils s\u2019int\u00e9ressent avec des <strong>propositions de valeur</strong> toujours plus innovantes. Et aujourd\u2019hui je suis impliqu\u00e9 dans un mouvement qui sera peut \u00eatre un <strong>Makestorming en 2017</strong> au sein d\u2019un <strong>R\u00e9seau Bruxellois de FabLabs (RBF)</strong> qui pense pouvoir se r\u00e9approprier des <strong>capacit\u00e9s de changements</strong> \u00e0 l\u2019aide de <strong>l\u2019assistance num\u00e9rique</strong> qu\u2019elle soit <strong>Soft ou Hardware</strong>. L\u2019<strong>OpenSource</strong> nourrit l\u2019espoir de voir les individus s\u2019associer pour FAIRE. Faire communaut\u00e9, faire sens, faire savoir, savoir faire.\n\nSi un <strong>changement de paradigme</strong> est possible c\u2019est parce que des individus se sont mis en chemin. Cette transition est rendue plus fluide aujourd\u2019hui gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019<strong>information distribu\u00e9e</strong> et \u00e0 des initiatives qui tendent \u00e0 lib\u00e9rer l\u2019innovation pour <strong>Le Commun</strong>. Les <strong>licences propri\u00e9taires</strong> qui cr\u00e9aient jusqu\u2019ici de la valeur non pas pour le bien commun mais principalement pour l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat priv\u00e9 volent en \u00e9clat. Aujourd\u2019hui une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration <strong>s\u2019organise, fait mouvement</strong> afin de rendre possible la <strong>cr\u00e9ation de biens communs entre pairs</strong>. Michel Bauwens, un belge, peut certainement \u00eatre reconnu comme un th\u00e9oricien de ce mouvement d\u2019\u00e9mancipation du mod\u00e8le actuel. Et les <strong>FabLabs</strong> comme les <strong>BioHackerspace</strong> et autres <strong>tiers-lieux</strong> sont surement les lieux o\u00f9 les Makers acc\u00e8dent aux outils capables de faire bouger les lignes.\n\n<i>Cette histoire est disponible aussi <a href=\"/t/makestorming-2017/493\">en anglais</a>.</i>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-30 06:49:39", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 15:07:14.455477", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1836, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31921, "user_id": 129, "topic_id": 2046, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>Run!</b>\n\nReplied to the new post!

[Alex] Mapping and connecting with smaller groups/tribes at first might be more fruitful, since in Bucharest tribes aren\u2019t all that coagulated yet and calling everyone to one big event might dilute meaning and commitment to the community. Clear &amp; tribe-specific call to actions might help draw people in. [Nadia, recapping] 1. Map groups/tribes of people interested in specific things 2. Sketch out possible things they might be interested in achieving/having access to (shared interests and relevant goals) 3. Articulate very clear call to action targeted to a specific tribe.\n\n[Noemi] In ER there is already high diversity, how to reconcile that with building very specific calls for local micro tribes? The social contract -&gt; connect, then bring resources &amp; build paid opportunities may not hold for everyone (this was Edgeryders 1, our first big project and how we came about). [Nadia] You don\u2019t design to speak to everyone. [Noemi] But in an early stage, an exploratory pilot in a city you know nothing about, how do you go about it? And if you do plan a local event where people come meet other people they\u2019re interested in and connect 1-on-1 and then leave, how do you signal value beyond immediate connections? [Nadia] You get them to stay by creating value for them.

The basic notion is that in any substantial crisis, municipal authorities will bear the brunt of the load. In a local (\u201cpoint\u201d) crisis, national agencies can come to the assistance of the troubled region. In a \u201csystemic\u201d crisis, national agencies may hit a few trouble spots, but will be generally ineffective. However, the mayor and the fire department and the chief of police are going to be right there, on site, weathering the storm or failing to do so.\n\nTherefore any planning for really severe scenarios needs to focus on the individual at home, and the mayor\u2019s office / local council. There\u2019s no central government support, they\u2019re spread too thin. And, generally speaking, there\u2019s only a limited amount of utility in planning for specific scenarios \u2013 too much could happen.

Something that will make sense now, in good situations, and in bad situations.\n\nPart of the reason for doing it that way is because selling very bad situations has proved really difficult - the \"high-impact unknown-probability event\" that's perceived as a \"so-low-as-to-be-neglegible-probability why-even-care-about-impact event\".\n\nBut another part is because of timing. We build the tools in times of \"peace\" and use them in times of \"war\". So, if they are not useable in times of piece, they get all rusty. They need to be double-use!\n\n---\n\nSo, double-use MACC? Sure. It's useful now. It could be a wiki-centered repository of useful tips and tools. Useful for any given percentage of municipalities (for the people living in those municipalities) during the present economic crisis, and more so if things get widely worse.\n\n---\n\nWhat would it look like? Not sure, and we need everyone's input here. I tend to frame it in terms of Why, What, How, What-if (as I was taught by a friend). So, here I go:\n\n1) Why? MACC is needed now in Greece, parts of Spain (there's a province where a number of kids get their only meal at school, and Summer is here), and surely in many other places in the world. It could be needed in any kind of \"war\" or \"revolution\".\n\n2) What? I think we need both the engineering and the governance.\n\nRegarding <strong>engineering</strong>, a polished subset of appropedia would give us the printable PDFs for stoves and water filters and toilets and transport and communication. Some of that is in lowtechmagazine.com and notechmagazine.com and in several other places. The guys at opensourceecology.org and wikispeed.com and solarfire.org are all doing their part - and I agree we might need hexayurt.com and star-tides.net and other things ... distilled for two (at most three) degrees of complexity. OSE is too big and too slow for certain scenarios, and there may be blood if and when they start to take other player's piece of pie.\n\nRegarding <strong>governance</strong>, Municipalities have their area of influence. I don't know if there would have to be any fixes here. Surely we could learn how things look like, and how they would need to be improved to make space for doing whatever's best in a range of circumstances. I'm pretty sure there needs to be room for non-governing entities (a citizen, a group, or whatever) to start things up with a minimum of bureaucracy. We need to look into how to \"differentially empower the incumbents\". Being able to get things done probably requires a range of strategies, depending on how willing and able everyone else is.\n\n3) How? A wikipage-centered approach looks good to me, so it probably wouldn't work &lt;grin&gt;. It appears to be deeply intertwined with the \"governance\" side of things.\n\n4) What-if? This would include the possibility that the toolset is not fully developed when the real mess starts. So we'd need some kind of contingency plans to spread it far and fast. Because we know crisis fuel preparedness best when it's too late, so we need to prepare for that. (For a flu pandemic, it was suggested there was need to research the best treatment, but it couldn't be done before it started, so a research protocol would be put in place before the pandemic, and enacted at the onset of the pandemic. Get ready for not being ready, sort of.)\n\nAll of this needs muscle and time. I don't know if we have that.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-27 22:22:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:48.083027", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 971, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16261], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8592, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5051, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Edgeryders: done</b>\n\nI reviewed and added comments to the online doc.

What I am asking myself, and others, is how our roles with respect to one another change with the decentralisation of manufacturing and access to knowledge and know how. I had an intiuition about the need to create some kind of playful distance to the topics in order to be able to have a real conversation, and an interface which is familiar (cards afford touching, we know how to interact with them...and tarot is a widely recognised ritual, people know they explore and reveal something about themselves in the interaction with the \"reader\"). So I just went ahead and made it with the help of some friends. In the context of a festival on learning, freedom and the web I set up a kind of tarot performance but explicity using custom made cards containing names of manufacturing technologies or manufacturing-related aretafacts or processes. The response was increadible, people would\u00a0 approach me anytime I sat down at the little table and at several points there was a que of people waiting to have their cards \"read\". I explained wha I was doing- that it was an art project, and how I was using the concept and the character of the tarot reader- no fortune telling whatsoever- the cards are just a reflective surface, a kind of mirror where they woud really be talking to themselves. It was immersive, a lot of fun and definitely something I will keep building on as soon as I get a\u00a0 little time.\n\nWhy is this social innovation? Well im not sure it is yet, but I got a few ideas for how it could be that I would like to explore further. Maybe as a tool for changing our perceptions of our relationships to technologies (technofobia in particular).\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-14 10:00:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:02.819487", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 376, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20406, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 3367, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>deadline when?</b>\n\nI'll probably be able to take a better look at this tomorrow or monday, when do you need to have some comments?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-19 04:31:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:53.599177", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 29, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11308, "user_id": 2330, "topic_id": 5206, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Le Space could become a nice ally</b>\n\nAnd the advantage of doing it there is that we get to know their community too.

He made this nice proposal for <em>us</em>! :) And he is onto something there. I've commuted to work with skateboard + public transport for years. In just about any European metropolis (if you can skate) that will be the fastest, cheapest, and most flexible way to get from A to B. I used to have (good) bikes. I love bikes. But it beats them cold*. You don't have to lock it (2x3 min saved), you just take it with you where you're going - trains, planes, buses, bikes. It (almost) never breaks. I have skated daily in wind, rain, snow, sleet, ice, sanded and salted snow (the only one I'd really not recommend). Longboards are fine, but more comfortable and practicable is a relatively big regular one with <strong>large soft rolls</strong> (important!). They are comfy and quiet\u00a0 + fast and efficient (and you're\u00a0 less likely to try stupid things that break your bones). Bucharest looks very <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@44.435097,26.100207,3a,75y,262.95h,66.37t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sJxUAY4b_xPrMCO_3MurCcw!2e0!6m1!1e1?hl=en\">skateable</a> and like most large cities in the east is graced with a pretty good public transport system - which is key to this intermodal approach. Still, when I moved to the US East coast, I again turned to skating as primary transport - even though the surface generally sucks compared to Europe.\n\nWhat I would often do in Europe is just get off a couple of stations earlier after work and sometimes skate the last 5-10 km or so. If you've done some daily skating that is no distance at all. I'd be going 12-17 km/h depending on the situation. This frees up a place in PT and let's me interact with the city much, much more intensively**. It is much easier and more likely that I'll stop and interact (groceries, help someone, etc.) than from a bike basis. Going relatively slow is no problem (at 3-5 km/h it gets tricky again on most surfaces). Plus, I got my hands free to do stuff, unlike on the bike (if you want to live long). Now the suggested next step:\n\n@Noemi Hook up with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2iHsGxRdaCs?t=382\">these nice people</a> (wait for the credits) if you haven't done so already. They generally have a very can-do attitude, are very enthusiastic, very good \"vibe creators\", and have street cred (authority among their peers, i.e. multipliers). In my experience they are also about as flaky and organized as a herd of cats on catnip. So that is the community manager bit. :)\n\nThere are several directions you could push it from there. Either a low level mutual help arrangement (e.g. if you have an event, ideally marching-type) skaters are extremely effective in moving ahead and around the march, engaging bystanders and people walking around. Just give them a t-shirt + backpack (on the belly) full of flyers/info material. Because they are 2-3 times walking speed they can easily cover most of the people there with no sweat. They can also go a few minutes ahead and give out \"invitations\" to join the march.\n\nYou could also try to use them as local stakeholders in city planning/zoning initiatives if you can shake the vandalism stigma that skating often has. For that you probably should recruit more \"center authority figures\". My best \"5-minute guess\" is <a href=\"https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=wRZQUKgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra\">Duta</a>. You will probably need a relatively well developed plan to get her motivated though. Perhaps you can find someone better, or work with one of her students. One idea for motivation could be a tiny distributed citizen science project leading to a publication. In brief: Some of the skater people go from one location to another and you check the time and modalities, then you use other methods (kickboard, bike, taxi, etc.) to travel and see which one is a promising candidate for future plans. If it goes well you have a basis for applying for all sorts of money to develop this concept further in practice. E.g. a EU sponsored pilot that supplies the (locally sourced - stakeholders) kickboards, skateboards etc. and does some sort of intermodal-to-work program to see what efficiency gains can be achieved and if it is transferable to other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city#GaWC_study\">beta or gamma or smaller cities.</a> I expect having a bike-share program is too expensive, and not really necessary for most places. This could work better. If you come from the outskirts you ride your bike to the last PT stop (if there's good surfacing you can directly use kick/skateboard) hop on and do the last mile via kick/skateboard again. Then you do urban-urban and see what the data tells you. Consider that a bike needs some place to stay (and theft may be an issue), and a skateboard needs almost none. This is a large advantage as planners want to create <em>dense </em>urban areas to deal with transport issues and ramp up innovation potential. Doing this with Duta also has the charm that, if this goes well - you can expect that she'll have an open ear for other small project proposals that she can pitch to bachelor/master students. A wonderful way to get things done!\n\nLastly if you want more thought on this, I'm of course available for discussion. Especially if this leads to a publication (just put me somewhere between the co-authors).\n\n*OT eyecandy: Always, always, always skate <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iCmGj9VbYE4?t=11\">responsibly</a>. :)\n\n**By the way there's a couple of movements that may be of interest to be found under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_the_city\">this label</a>.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-03 14:39:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:56.958510", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1050, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1643, "user_id": 55, "topic_id": 1610, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.918);\">I went for an interview to work as an engineer for an NGO in India through a UK charity.

We spent around 10-15 minutes to read my application during the interview time and then I had the feeling that they expected something completely different of me. The questions were asked had nothing to do with the position I was applying and at the end both sides, specially myself realise that we could never match.\u00a0Then I was so furious that I wanted to ask to fund my flight and all expenses I did for something completely meaningless.\u00a0\n\nMy question is: do you think that job agencies could solve this problem between employee and employer or it is something that only both sides should work on?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-22 21:13:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:26.873373", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 200, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18449, "user_id": 2512, "topic_id": 4195, "post_number": 5, "raw": "The Trojan horse approach is (almost always) the correct one in this area Alberto.

As a nine year old I wanted to be a superhero, but lately scientist seems much more interesting than punching around a bunch of clowns in spandex. So let's do some science! And the way we do it, in the time honored tradition, is by hacking each other's arguments apart. So let me have a go. In love and deep respect for what you are doing.\u00a0\n\nTo do this, I first need to understand your argument. Let me start here: in my (admittedly not very deep) understanding of Fisher's equation, V does not affect anything, because it is not a variable. It is a parameter, which most people assume to be relatively stable in the short run. It increases with structural change in the transacting behavior of economic agents: suppose you are looking at V1 and suddenly people invent and start to use credit cards, you will see that you don't need to increase M1 to accomodate an increased volume in transaction, because a smaller quota of transactions is now happening in cash. But those changes are slow: you are talking decades.\n\nAlso, GDP is separated from MV by the degree of vertical integration in the economy. What I mean is this: suppose I am a farmer. I grow wheat with no inputs other than my field, rainwater and sunlight. This year seeds come from last year's harvest; so does my subsistence, because I live off bread that I bake from my wheat. Each year I sell my harvest (less the wheat I need to keep me going another year) to a man who lives in a city, and that is the only transaction that happens in this economy. Now suppose someone invents a plough. A plough is made of steel, so I can't produce it off my time alone, but it makes my work easier and more productive. So now I take the money from my client, give it to the ploughmaker for him to make me a plough. With the plough, I can now produce more wheat, that I sell to my client at the end of the year.\u00a0\n\nTwo things are happening here: possibly more wheat is being produced; and certainly there is another transaction going on, upstream of my field, between me and the ploughmaker. Only the first increases GDP, because wheat is something we, the economy, desire per se. The plough, instead, we don't particularly want if not for its contribution to wheat production, of which it is a part. The point of all this is that - if V is constant - you need to increase the money supply as economic activity gets more vertically disintegrated, as it does. GDP measures value added, and it is not not NOT the sum of all the transactions. Modern finance, also, radicalizes the process, because it uses up a lot of transactions but produces very little. So you need a massive increase in money supply (of course I am not talking about M1) to sustain financialization.\u00a0\n\nGiven this, I don't understand what you are measuring when deflating GDP by money supply. I would expect to see the transactive intensity of GDP to increase over time: as both industrial organization and finance become more sophisticated, you need more units of transactions to make one unit of GDP. This, however, is arguably a sign of efficiency: a company brands my laptop, but another one makes the screen, yet another one makes the DVD driver, one the wi-fi antenna and so on. This is just Smith's division of labor, which implies... more transaction.\u00a0\n\nDoes this make sense or did I manage to miss the point entirely? Do you want to post a link to the paper?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-21 15:58:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:48.837890", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 652, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4662, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4629, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello guys, while we wait for the evaluation of Opencare: I am at <a href=\"http://caps-conference.eu/\">CAPS15EU</a>\u00a0and I heard Fabrizio Sestini, the CAPS programme coordinator, make the following suggestion:\n\n\"We, the Commission, are not allowed to publish your proposals.

Our online conversation ended up with 115 articles, 570 comments and over 30 live sessions in Matera (not including the organisational work and over 100 tasks and related comments). What have we learned about producing knowledge at these parameters of scale and reach: global, distributed and grassroots, and where can it go?\n\n<h2>Supporting each other\u2019s intellectual development</h2>\n\nSince stewardship is a difficult topic to grasp (and in our experience the word itself does not help), we built common understandings of it from <a href=\"/t/aspects-of-stewardship/3620\">scratch</a> and into a semi-structured <a href=\"/en/search/content/lote4\">conversation</a>. Three areas were discovered, each based on the locus of projects: physical stewardship (primarily public assets like buildings, water, transport infrastructure), digital stewardship (online surveillance and data protection, the open software movement, the Internet of things), community stewardship (sharing economy, peer to peer services, unMonastery international residency hosting LOTE4). <a href=\"/t/fully-unpacking-lote4-organisation-processes-key-roles-budget-and-outcomes/3982\">Organising LOTE4 </a>was in itself a meta project of community stewardship, mobilizing talent and skill in a loosely coordinated process to build a setting where people would come together and engage with each other beyond professional fields and the biases that come with. By the time of the conference, everyone participating was equipped with citizen expert knowledge (the one that traditional experts <a href=\"https://egov20.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/6-things-only-citizens-can-offer-to-government/\">don't have</a>) on how taking care of common assets, digital/ physical spaces or communities can contribute to bettering lives around them. The shared knowledge is going to be packed and made available as a research report and test of the Open Ethnographer software starting February.\n\n<h2>Community members contributing on their own terms</h2>\n\nOne of the advantages of operating under a decentralized architecture is that literally anyone can choose what to contribute and do it on their own terms. The most adventurous Edgeryders like @Ben and @Lauren launched themselves into the <a href=\"/t/lote4-stewardship-case-studies/418\">Case Study Adventure</a> to meet their peers across the world working passionately to make a difference. The rationale was:\n\n\u201cWe want to engage projects that we think exemplify notions of Stewardship[..] We\u2019d like to find the initiatives that are confronting the difficult questions head on, both newly started and those with a long history. Despite our work over the last couple of years within Edgeryders and the unMonastery project we recognise that our perspectives are still limited by the networks we\u2019re most familiar with, we\u2019d like to take this opportunity to broaden our horizons\u201d.\n\nA lot of exploratory work was done in the region of Basilicata and largely across Italy, where @NicoBis travelled to talk to people doing meaningful work. Video interviews gave us an opportunity to understand both citizen and policy makers approaches to stewardship, and where these two meet. For example, here Fabrizio Barca in the Italian ministry of finance legitimizing stewardship by communities as a third way: \"Community stewardship is a reaction to a double failure. The failure of the state to provide services tailored to places; and the failure of the private sector when privatization became the new game in town, but turned out to be ineffective and unjust\".\n\nThese efforts were entirely voluntary, and it made sense that the broader community would back them up with outreach support, helping host events in cities like Berlin, Athens, Amsterdam, Stockholm, or London. The others were happy to exchange notes when documentation was posted online, as per the long time nurtured practice in Edgeryders.\n\nMixing the online channels with field work, and many to many conversations with more private meetups turned out to be very useful in understanding stewarding as a practice. As someone noticed, \u201cif you're asking the right questions with just one or two people it can still be hugely productive - perhaps more so than a big group speaking together.\u201d\n\n<h2>Making global knowledge relevant locally, and vice versa</h2>\n\nAlmost all of the projects mentioned before and during The Stewardship live deeply in local contexts. An international event and global storytelling culture slightly removes them from those contexts in order to emphasize relevance, but only to examine them closer when people come together in a room. In one of LOTE plenaries, focusing on learning from the Case Study Adventure, it became clear that acting as stewards in highly regulated environments requires self sacrifice and sometimes even transgressing rules (eg: occupying or repurposing public spaces to meet community needs). Some countries are more sensitive to this than others, depending on legislation or simply degree of conservativeness in those cultures etc.\n\nAnother example is the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315\">unMonastery</a>, a project birthed internationally whose work is focused on local challenges. Bringing to Matera an event like LOTE4 in its aftermath put the city on the map of many of the continent's hackers, activists and radical social innovators. Projects like <a href=\"/t/coderdojo-from-unmonastery-to-matera-a-story-of-inclusive-collaborative-fun-learning/3726\">CoderDojo</a> or <a href=\"/t/kiderwind/581\">Kiderwind</a> are taking off in the city, and provide chances for the local community to learn from or to learn how to interact with global innovators.\n\n<h2>Building ongoing collaboration </h2>\n\nComing from a natively European environment, Edgeryders (the organisation is a spin off from a joint Council of Europe / European Commission project) has a history of interacting with policy makers and interfacing between formal structures and citizens at the edge. We think some of the most relevant work for social impact can happen at the intersection of these two, and this is why we insisted on having a former member of the European Parliament as an event curator:\n\n\u201cI tried to make my experiences of the European Parliament useful for other visitors at \\#LOTE4 by encouraging more interaction with political institutions. Especially in a community which so often restricts its interaction with policy to interaction with governments and civil servants, my hope is that some people now feel more encouraged to speak with directly elected individuals.\u201c (<a href=\"/t/stewardship-and-policy-lote4-post-reflection/3837\">Amelia Andersdotter</a>)\n\nLearning how to activate and involve the citizenry, and give them space once they got involved is also at the core of Edgeryders collaboration with Matera 2019. Community members and former unMonastery residents have recently entered an open data contest held by the municipality of Matera, <a href=\"/t/hacking-public-transport-matera-and-beyond/3984\">winning</a> two out of the four prizes with an open app mapping the public transport infrastructure. Instead of taking the prize and walk away, they are now re-investing it in an upcoming collaborative event to continue developing the project, all in an attempt to leave something behind that the local community will benefit from.\n\nThe topic of stewardship and what Edgeryders are learning collectively is paving the <a href=\"/t/life-after-lote4-were-dreaming-of-new-unmonasteries-more-harmonious-hackathons/3962\">way forward</a> for \"blue sky\" ideas generation and where grassroots communities will put in skills and energy. It happened at \\#31c3 event, where some set up an <a href=\"/en/edgeryders-at-31c3\">assembly</a> to explore new dimensions of well being and peer to peer care (among which a collaboration with the <a href=\"https://foodhackingbase.org/\">Food Hacking Base </a>on social cooking) and how they can be an integral part of innovative event formats. As part of a social contract that empowers the doers, it is up to every one of us to step forward and take ideas wherever we see fit, and that is perhaps the strongest asset we have as a collective.\n\n<h2>We need to better support and reward the stewards</h2>\n\nIn several sessions at LOTE the stewards\u2019 precarious condition was explored, particularly since most truly innovative projects are low resourced and voluntary, with small groups shouldering a great size of the effort (see <a href=\"https://lote4.hackpad.com/Stewarding-Communities-F8r2VazmLYw\">examples</a>). The risks are manifold for achieving impact, from mismanaging expectations or resources (not enough eyeballs), to loss of <a href=\"https://storify.com/throw_away/lote4-reliability\">reliability</a> (achieving growth by compromising) or even burnouts (\u2018temporary ownership is an aspect of precarity\u2019, notices one of the stewards). These all reproduce the same inequalities which stewarding is trying to address by increasing use value: inequalities in access, in consumption, in relative gains and so on. Who is caring for the stewards? Who else can and should act as carrier for the learnings? What can we learn from open hardware/software projects combating scarcity (\u2018so hard to do that without ending up homeless eating nothing but beans\u2019, says an Edgeryder)? These are but some of the deeper questions we could begin to address with our approach of network engagement and Open Ethnographer.", "created_at": "2015-01-19 16:12:14", "updated_at": "2018-01-13 04:49:14.013375", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1596, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 41.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1974, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31621, "user_id": 2560, "topic_id": 4525, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b> mutually rewarding benefits</b>\n\nTrue that <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>.\u00a0Grassroot communities tend to be small and less formalised and for that matter collaboration with other partners take time and effort and skills in communication and negotiation which they might lack.

The second iteration of <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/\">the Edgeryders platform</a> is up and running. We are very happy and very proud, though there remain some minor visualization bugs (don't access it with Internet Explorer just yet!). We have already covered the results of October's <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/2011/10/beta-test-first-impressions/\" style=\"line-height: 1.7;\">beta testing phase</a>. Though the alpha platform had many flaws, observing the fledgling community's online behavior led us to many interesting insights.\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/05ef97bbb4d4aada703f14f0ef4789cd614b410a.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"><br>\n\nI was personally fascinated by how clear patterns of use were: testers decided to use the various pages in the website in ways we had not foreseen. In biological terms, this is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exaptation\">exaptation</a>, and it is one of the processes at work in evolution: it is what happens when a species \"recycles\" an organ for a functionality different from the one it evolved for. For example, the first amphibians exapted fins as rough paws, to move on dry land. Exaptation was exactly what we had been hoping for in the Edgeryders tests. It is a great gift: our community, by using the platform in a creative way,\u00a0 pointed to design choices that could have been made and would have been right. So, all we needed to do was pay attention. And we did: we ended up rethinking completely what the different parts of the website are for. Here are some examples:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>the home page had a status update facility and a block that visualizes the stream of recent activity (\u00e0 la Facebook). I thought this would make it a good first stop, a place to decide where to go next. But testers started using it as a social meeting point: so we redeployed it as <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/stream\">Hangout </a>- Edgeryders's public square.</li>\n\n<li>the profile page tended to be used as a place to share something about yourself. From it, participants can also get in touch with each other: just visit someone's profile page and leave him or her a message (<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/alberto\">here is mine</a> - of course you have to be logged in to leave a message). You can also nominate the person as an Edgemapper - somebody whose life path inspires you. In fact, we even have <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/bootcamp/shine-some-light\">a mission to do it</a>! So, we stripped away other functionalities, making the profile page into the interface of each individual Edgeryder with the community.</li>\n\n<li>that left the need for a \"mission control\" page, a place where participants can be reminded which missions thay have finished and pick their next one. So we redeployed our <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/show/missions\">Missions</a> page, previously simply a list of links, adding conditional buttons that say \"start\" or \"continue\" depending on your status with respect to that particular mission.</li>\n\n<li>the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/page/about-game\">gameplay</a> (points, badges, notifications) was not really working in the alpha. That absorbed quite a lot of work, but now all these functionalities are there.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThis process has been long and exhausting for us all, but it has an enormous benefit: it brings the wisdom of the early Edgeryders adopters, the pioneers of the community, into the platform's design. Let me credit once again the beta testers (who are getting rewarded with a badge) , our development team at <a href=\"http://nois3lab.it\">nois3lab</a> and the fine folks at Acquia for giving the world <a href=\"http://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-commons-social-business-software\">Drupal Commons</a>, on which Edgeryders is based. Here's to you, thanks with all our hearts. And now, let's get down to it. We have a generation to explore, and a world to build.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-09 10:54:48", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 20:17:35.989026", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 711, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32291, "user_id": 1504, "topic_id": 2204, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>Will be there in the afternoon</b>\n\nHeading up soon!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-30 12:52:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:57.429840", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16607, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5112, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Proposal to Re:Publica submitted!</b>\n\nfingers crossed!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-10 15:51:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:32.939001", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1450], "is_private": false}, {"id": 551, "user_id": 3477, "topic_id": 518, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>[@Noemi\u2019s note] I was happy to connect with Emma Jones, who is in her words, a third of the We Mental Health Nurses team at <a href=\"http://www.wecommunities.org/\">WeCommunities</a>, along with Vanessa Garrity and Mark Brown. This story serves as a first encounter with Edgeryders. It also includes written reflections by Vanessa.</em>\n\nWeMHNurses hosts regular mental health themed twitter chats, as part of a network <a href=\"http://www.wecommunities.org/tweet-chats/chat-calendar\">chat calendar</a>, with wildly diverse topics ranging from \u201cThe use of digital technology in everyday practice\u201d to \u201cWorkplace democracy in mental health\u201d. The core team runs the day to day operations, on a purely voluntary basis, with the WeMHNurses account, also linking into the wider WeCommunities, which covers many different branches of Nursing and Health Care professions and specialism. Topics for chats tend to mostly emerge from topical conversations within the community or where there is, for example a national policy directive or key piece of published journalism relating to mental health. The community also run sponsored chats for national bodies such as the Dept of Health, Care Quality Commission and NHS England. <strong>The WeMHNurses team see their role as being about facilitating broader conversation in a democratised digital space, where everyone can have a voice, regardless of positional authority.</strong> The team also see their role as being to make national policy more accessible, in terms of the language being used. The community also has a particular focus on discussing the everyday implications of policy on mental health nursing practice.\n\nThe chats are generally facilitated by one of the @WeMHNurses team, with guests are often invited to participate in the chat where the person brings specific expertise to the conversation. This is an open process, whereby anyone can contact the team to suggest a chat topic or to ask to host a chat.The team provide support to individuals who want to host a chat from the @WeMHNurses Twitter handle.\n\nOur ethos is very much that \u201cyour opinion matters\u201d and we focus on the user point of view, getting people talking to each other and bringing a variety of perspectives to the conversation. <strong>We enjoy working with people who have previously been in services or are currently in services because we really value the lived experience perspective. </strong>As we are an independent voice, we will also cover topics that might be considered controversial, political or critical, as we believe that these conversations are important in setting the future direction for mental health nursing.\n\nOn reflection, we think that the liveliest and most informative chats are often where there is a real mixture of perspectives, including for example, clinicians, people accessing services, managers, leaders, academics, researchers and policy makers. <strong>The conversations that we have online are often very powerful for this reason as we can\u2019t think of many examples from our own professional lives, where there has been such a variety of voices in a room to debate a topic in such a level and democratic way.</strong> An example of this is a chat that Vanessa and Mark ran with the Health Service Journal, where we discussed the reduction of inpatient mental health beds across the country. This chat was very much brought to life by people sharing their experiences of how this impacted on them personally when they needed to access inpatient care.\n\nThe demographics for our chat suggest that we have a largely UK audience. However, because of the global reach of Twitter, we do have some international representation within our community and we love to encourage this because of the dimension that it brings to the conversation\n\nBefore we run a chat, we produce some pre chat information on the wecommunities website. This is generally written in a blog style, so it is broadly accessible reading. We are also looking at how we can make our chats even more inclusive, such as by providing audio for people who struggle to read or who have visual impairment. The challenge for us is that we are all volunteers, so we have to find ways of delivering information quickly.\n\n<em>How come this twitter format for talking about mental health? Is there something in the medium that helps learning, or alleviation for individuals?</em>\n\nAs with everything there are always pros and cons. Some would say \u201cthere\u2019s only so many characters on twitter\u201d and mental health can be a very complex topic to discuss with limited characters, especially when people are talking about personal experience. On the other hand, it can help you be more focused and concise in what you are trying to say.\n\nI suppose using twitter to talk about mental health is quite personal, as is twitter use in general. There are many who find it hugely therapeutic and helpful, either getting involved in chats, communicating/ networking with others or for gaining support. It is a fab place for the sharing of information, including research and it's also a great forum for challenging stigma and moving the mental health agenda forward.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5896def7f40a6955128d4630c37f1cd79e89319e.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"368\">\n\n<em>Wordcloud from\u00a0participants twitter bios in a recent chat -\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.wecommunities.org/tweet-chats/chat-details/2885\">source</a>.</em>\n\n<em>Is there a cutoff number for participants in a chat? Or a number that makes it effective? I\u2019m wondering because you have such high regularity - every week.</em>\n\nThere is not a maximum number of people in each chat, it can be anybody using the hashtag. Often people pop into the chat with just one or two tweets, whilst at the same time, we are having a conversation with other people, who participate in the entirety of the chat. When you are facilitating a chat, which is busy, it can be a challenge responding to every single tweet, but we do try to do this and often we find that people branch off and have separate conversations with other participants, within the chat, which goes down a different path to the structured questions of the main chat. Providing they still use the hashtag, we still capture this conversation in the transcript at the end. <a href=\"http://www.wecommunities.org/tweet-chats/chat-details/2885\">This</a> is an example of the latest archived chat on a Tuesday evening, counting 133 contributors, 1200 tweets and with a reach of 7,561,098! This was a joint chat with @wenurses and @weldnurses.\n\nWith our over 6000 followers, plus the wider network, I suppose it is hard to say how many people we reach constantly. However, analytics for the chat are captured within the wecommunities website. Nick Chinn is the technical person behind this at Wecommunities.\n\n<em>What do you think draws people in? What makes it a community for you? Is it people interacting with each other, learning, figuring out stuff?</em>\n\nI suppose it is all of that. Everyone involved in the chats is interested in that particular area and that shared interest drives the discussions and questions in the chat, which will often support the development of links between people. Often people in the chats might say: \u2018this is a good chat\u2019, and \u2018why don\u2019t we do one on this other topic area?\u2019 It then keeps expanding, and there are more things that we get involved in. So, in essence, the community is about sharing knowledge and learning, being open to thinking in different ways and developing a support network as well.\n\n<em>What for the future and how can we support your work?</em>\n\nWe are\u00a0very aware that people establish relationships and friendships offline with people who they have connected with on Twitter and that these relationships are often a great source of strength and support for people. Vanessa and Teresa Chinn, Founder of WeCommunities organised an unConference earlier in the year, through crowdfunding, which brought together 300 people from the community into a physical space to get together and to debate and discuss the future direction of social media in health care. We also provided a parallel online agenda throughout the day, so that the twitter community could still very much be part of it, even if they couldn\u2019t physically attend. Vanessa and Mark from WeMHNurses and Mental Elf on Twitter are also in the process of setting up a Digital mental health conference service, which we are launching at \\#PDDigital16 later in November.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-02 15:43:04", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 15:09:50.288607", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1516, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 761, "user_id": 3432, "topic_id": 728, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The \u2018<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BigBangEdu/\">Big Bang Schools</a>\u2019 is a new educational approach and a new type of schools that are re-designed for an era of exponential technological advance and social change. The project seeks to create innovation labs for real human challenges and the planet, helping shape the future instead of repeating the past. It is considered as a catalyst for a new civilization paradigm of joining forces towards \u201cupgrading humanity\u201d.\n\nWe used the name \u2018Big Bang\u2019 in a symbolic way to highlight the explosion of new ideas and the creation of brand new knowledge from scratch. A new Big Bang of Creation is about to start at Thessaloniki in the following 2 years (2018) hoping that the idea will expand to other Greek cities and abroad. A school where learning is accomplished experientially, in harmony and interaction with the natural environment, aiming to lead children on a wonderful quest.\n\nCentral in our philosophy is that educational activities must take place within the natural environment and the whole procedure must be supported through workshops where pupils have the opportunity to discover and connect with new information. Our educational approach encourages the development of capacities through observation, flexibility, adaptability, evaluation, goal setting and self-confidence in order to create their own path of life.\n\nThe Big Bang Schools are furthering the vision of our initial project, the \u201cSchool of Nature and Colours\u201d. This is an educational role model of creative self-management, in which pupils are taught beyond the curriculum how to learn in-depth, sing, dance, stage theatrical plays, raise funds for their school through a vegetable garden and make their activities and campaigns are known to the public using social media.\n\nIn this framework, we organize a unique Creative Centre for our children which we called<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Big-Bang-after-School-651071675042509/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE\"> BIG BANG after SCHOOL</a>\u2019. This is a comprehensive program for elementary school children and kindergarten, where all participants are able to connect with music, cinema, dance, theater, arts as well as workshops in creative thinking, constructions, architecture and engineering. Additionally, we created a specific program for elementary courses such as science, history, philosophy and multilingualism. In this project, everyone is welcome to contribute in different ways besides financial support. This is a project designed to benefit children and parents who seek for alternative educational methods of learning and interacting with people and the natural environment.\n\nMy name is Angelos Patsias, an educator on my 30s who aims to launch various innovative activities that will help create a new educational system that will meet the specific needs of each and every place. I started my studies in Primary Level Education at the Democritus University of Thrace and I am currently reading issues for an MA candidate at the Faculty of Sociology at the University of Crete. My philosophy of life encourages me to encounter every difficult circumstance as an opportunity, and at the same time, I strongly believe that returning to the simple meaning of life is an essential action.\n\nMy partner, Veta Georgiadou has been a kindergarten teacher in public schools for 22 years. Our collaboration in \u201cBig Bang Schools\u2019 project started when she watched my TEDx speech about \u2018<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsf2AQ9Oq9U\">Breaking the walls between school and society</a>\u2019. As she usually says: \u2018Children are the best tutors because they believe in miracles, the life at a present time, are full of enthusiasm and are creating all the time\u2019. She studied pedagogics, eventually becoming a wife and mother of three children and her constant self-searching voyage with pupils, parents, teachers, who never stop learning and reforming is still ongoing.\n\nThe third partner, Yiannis Sotirakos, is a serial entrepreneur developing projects and technologies towards \u201cUpgrading Humanity\u201d, and innovative educational and edutainment platforms to empower the youth.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-20 18:42:56", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 13:24:16.905889", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 678, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17905, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3584, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>So... where are sample data?</b>\n\nDo we get to look at any data?

We have big numbers (over 2,100 contributions from over 170 individual) and stellar quality.\u00a0I highly recommend plunging into the fantastic stories that are coming through every day. If you don't know where to\u00a0start, you could follow our daily recommendations on Twitter/email, or just ask @Noemi .\n\nWe also need to start looking at the conversation as a whole, as a collective intelligence phenomenon. Edgeryders has had APIs for a while, and yesterday I played a little bit with them to generate a snapshot of the opencare conversation network. It's quite beautiful:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5b72f298201e9ecb4f6107e9ed3aa34cbe217c5f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"475\">\n\nNode size maps to length of incoming comments (receiving more, longer comments makes your node bigger). Edge color maps to the word count in that communication (a bright red edge from Bob to Alice means Bob has written more, longer comments addressed to Alice).\n\nYou can see the structure. There are three types of nodes. In the center, you see dense conversation of protagonists: @Rune , @Alex_Levene , @ybe , @Yannick , @WinniePoncelet , @maymay , @woodbinehealth , @Pauline , @Rozina , @Aravella_Salonikidou and many others. In the periphery, we have people who have had limited interaction with the rest of the network, often through only one person. We even have a few isolated nodes, though I am sure that will change quickly.\u00a0These are participants that have not shared a story of their own, but have left one or a few\u00a0comments somewhere. Finally, you have \"hubs\", participants that serve the purpose of connecting the central nodes with the peripheral ones. @Noemi , @Nadia and myself are the highest-connected ones.\n\nThis is confirmed by subcommunity detection. Below you see the same graph, but color-coded for clusters.\u00a0Hubs are strong enough that each generates her own subcommunity, shaped like a star with the hub at the center; but, to the southeast of the graph, you also see two subcommunities with a more complex structure than a star (they grey-blue one and the purple one). These are forming now, as people in opencare talk more and more to each other rather than to us.\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1a88afc8ea4e8a13c52f09da57b6edf92457baf9.jpeg\" width=\"690\" height=\"475\">\n\nNone of this is semantic yet. But we are working on it: soon we'll be able to show what people are actually talking about in those interaction.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-19 11:52:00", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 14:54:27.096271", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 434, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 36.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3402, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16158, "user_id": 1693, "topic_id": 2928, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>This is an art</b>\n\nI think this is a really important project, as someone who has been involved in lots of community projects that had really unpleasant and proprietary internal comm systems. It's a great adventure! A few resources that might be helpful:\n\n<a href=\"http://owncloud.org/\"><strong>ownCloud</strong></a>. A super scalable and adaptable libre cloud system that can be self-hosted. It keeps getting better and better. I've found the document storage (i.e. Dropbox) to be fairly functional, the calendar to be excellent (synched with Thunderbird), and the contacts to be fine, though the Thunderbird side of the interface is screwy. There are lots of other features, including a rudimentary replacement for Google Docs and more. But this is a very worthwhile project to work with and contribute to, as it could be very powerful in enabling communities to detach themselves from evil Goog dependency.\n\n<strong>Occupy.</strong> During its various iterations the Occupy movement developed some interesting tools to manage collaborations across the movement. It could provide something of a model. Here are some examples:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuddyPress\">BuddyPress</a> is a sophisticated social network plugin for WordPress that was often used for the internal websites for various occupations. <a href=\"http://www.nycga.net/\">Here's the one for the ill-fated New York General Assembly</a>. For a while it functioned very, very well as a way of keeping track of events, working groups, and discussion about proposals in the assemblies. It was eventually overrun with trolls, but there are probably ways of dealing with that via moderation of a kind that wasn't possible for a movement that was, at the time, at the center of world media attention while trying to remain open.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://occupy.net/\">The Occupy Network</a> was a later attempt to create an Occupy-in-a-box framework full of libre tools. It kind of ran aground, but the idea was great: a suite of stuff like Etherpad, classifieds, a directory, forums, wiki, etc.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://interoccupy.net/\">InterOccupy </a>started as a really well-moderated conference calling network and then developed into a more extensive set of services. You can fill out a form to set up a \"hub,\" which means being listed in their directory and calendar. I think it used to also get you a GNU mailing list and other open tools maintained by fairly competent folks. It was the network created by these folks that became the basis of the hugely successful Occupy Sandy relief effort.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<a href=\"https://riseup.net/\"><strong>Riseup</strong></a>. This is a suite of tools that are useful to lots of activists in the US, maintained by supposedly competent folks. For users who agree to a statement of principles (which is as specific as not privileging class politics above identity politics), they offer stuff like Tor, Email, Mailing Lists, VPN, chat, and etherpad.\n\n<a href=\"http://vanillaforums.org/\"><strong>Vanilla</strong></a>. These forums simple and wonderful. An old idea that keeps being great.\n\nThere's so much more. Maybe every unMonastery should have its own unCurrency. The challenge, I think, is to figure out how to have everything you need and absolutely nothing else, so it doesn't overwhelm the folks who don't like to deal with lots of do-dads like some of us do. In one collective I'm part of, I made the very luddite team very happy (and ended internal emails almost for good) with just a simple HTML page with a Vanilla forum and plain text and chat via etherpad side by side. This is an art.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-16 18:36:39", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:44.583594", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 640, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2161], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2157, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 2124, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Identify possible funding for the build.\u00a0 The stove will be built largely from free reclaimed metal so build costs should be minimal.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-06 02:40:59", "updated_at": "2017-10-28 18:10:07.427307", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2184, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2151, "post_number": 1, "raw": "One week after leaving Matera, the Lote3 experience stays actively\u00a0with me. I finally got the chance to get my head around it and document this highly interactive session from Sunday, Day 4 that felt most generative to me personally. Why? Because it prompted me to act on what was said and take peer advice very seriously. I guess this is a big big thank you to [rhithink] for proposing and facilitating it, and to [pacheca], [JamesL], [annaJ], [havartu], [nat], [JulianoS]\u00a0and everyone who shared advice in all honesty &lt;3\n\nThis was a session where anyone coming in was invited to share personal projects and list the kind of skills they would need help with or ask for guidance. For me the question was how do we learn new web tool fast while living and working online, in times of fast, competitive, resource-constrained learning? (<a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/skype-much-how-do-we-upskill-fast-in-technology-online-tools\">proposal here</a>). And I got some very helpful hints by listening to how others do it.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Online tutorials: </strong>recommended by Julian as his step-by-step, easy to follow\u00a0learning process which actually works.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Online communities</strong>: lots of useful platforms recommended and explained in more detail by Anna, such as Quora.com, Lynda.com or Echo. note to self: might be difficult to learn by engaging with multiple\u00a0online communities, pick the one that works for you!</li>\n\n<li><strong>One very important advice I got from Rhiannon was to Make learning social and enjoyable:</strong>\u00a0<em>\u201cI needed to build my own website. Not a big one, just a wordpress. I didn\u2019t know how to do it, so like through a friend of a friend I met someone who could help\u201d</em></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nTo ensure rewards are in place you could use something like timebank: e.g. exchange one hour of coding for cooking dinner for someone. This could turn into even more useful learning for even more people here on Edgeryders if we manage to turn it into social contracts which make sense for us as community members.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Referencing the ER platform: create simple wikis where you ask for help </strong>(the underlying assumption in this social contract is that by asking you also make yourself available to others\u2019 requests) -&gt; this is easier to implement if and when more of us take the lead and teach others how to do it by example. I think it was [Jamesl] who mentioned the need for a format to ask for help?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI was amazed at how quickly personal dilemmas like Rita\u2019s time management problem resonated with the group, and how we figured out together it's more a problem of life management which, again, most of us have! Anna suggested a pretty cool idea to get ourselves into critically assessing achievements and where we are going, what is most worth our time etc\u00a0<span>The idea is to </span><strong style=\"line-height: 1.7;\">design ourselves and fill in a personal blank sheet of paper, like a spider web map</strong><span>: you put up a goal and plot several smaller things you\u2019re doing or achieving in different points in time and how they indicate an overall picture and a linear progression in time. I already started doing that with a format from mindvalley which I found useful (see video below), has anybody else started?</span>\n\nAlternatively, you could set yourself in a reminder mode and\u00a0get in touch monthly with friends to discuss achievements &amp; milestones in a way that helps everyone understand better where they\u2019re going: what Natali said stuck with me -\u00a0<em style=\"line-height: 1.7;\">\u201cwe want witnesses to our lives, with whom to share achievements\u201d.\u00a0</em>\n\nFinally, I was most impressed by the easiness with which we made ourselves available to one another,\u00a0showing care for each other\u2019s dilemmas. This is what I\u2019m left with: a personal commitment to offer help and also ask for it in a way that not only doesn\u2019t burden others, but makes it worthwhile their time and shows my availability to return the effort. Thank you all so much!\n\nI would like to ask you guys to revisit our Sunday afternoon in \u201cthe best skill workshop location\u201d (James) ever in Matera and take the time to add your reflections or simply re-iterate your availability to others.

Applications must accept the <a href=\"http://100resilientcities.rockefellerfoundation.org/resilience\">Rockefeller Foundation definition</a>. However, it is is ok to mention priorities (first, protecting lives; second, fighting and preventing disease; third, protecting assets and property).\n\n2 is accepted. Analysis is clearly central \u2013 especially analysis of vulnerabilities (example: in Finland water shortages are unlikely to be a problem; in the Canarias, maintaining a transportation network can be difficult when circumstances are bad). Ranking risks is also very useful. But fat-tailed distributions mean there is little to gain in trying to estimate the risks in terms of probability.\n\n3 is accepted. Interdependencies are a thorny problem in the resilience debate, because\u00a0 authorities build resilience around organizational structures, and that almost always means silos. Example:\u00a0Sweden is the only country to have formally addressed the systemic risks associated with antibiotics usage,\u00a0 though everyone knows it's there. So, you get people in charge of responding to earthquakes, who will tend to think that major economic collapse or a fuel shortage is someone else's problem. Events that are difficult to classify may result in slow or undecisive action. We make the case that this is a mistake, and try to factor interdependencies into the equation.\n\n4 is accepted, and it follows from 3. Point risks (eg. earthquakes) and systemic risks (eg. glu, financial collapse) need to be kept separate. Point events can be very acute, but they don't spread because of stochastic independence (probability of earthquake here is independent of an earthquake happening over there; joint probability == product on individual probability =&gt; essentially zero). Systemic risks attack the whole area or system at the same time =&gt; nobody can come for help. Some systemic risks are not dire (eg. fuel shortage); we take into account their full range and not just collapse (consistent with the rejection of 1).\n\n5\u00a0 is accepted, and it follows from 3 and 4.\n\n6 is accepted, and it follows from 3. In turn, it implies 7 \u2013 knowledge is duplicated and taught reduntantly to as many people as possible. It implies that policy looks like this:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>skill up the populace</li>\n\n<li>build a core of experts</li>\n\n<li>build fast ways to teach newbies skills to deploy when bad stuff happens (this would naturally include teaching other-city newbies, thus\u00a0growing the network, once a foothold is gained in the initial city's own ground)</li>\n\n<li>teach concepts like <a href=\"http://resiliencemaps.org/\">SCIM</a> to enable the local people to have a conversation about resilience and contingencies. Don't keep it just to the experts!</li>\n\n<li>incorporate the knowledge in evolving artifacts (local <a href=\"http://www.appropedia.org/Welcome_to_Appropedia\">Appropedias</a> as deliverables).\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>incorporate the artifact in keeper institutions like the unMonastery to prevent degradation of the signal. A lively local ongoing debate on resilience could help a lot reduce signal degradation \u2013 think StackExchange, in which the knowledge is not written down in an artefact but incorporated in a community of people that, collectively, know all the asnwers.

Combining a network building real world resilient communities\n\n\u00a0\n\nApp:\n\nthe app is primarily a step-by-step guide for people that know nothing about gardening at all, but would like to get started growing their own useful foods. emphasis would be put on growing things from seed. but if a user were to chose to buy a small plant from a garden center, an option would be available to skip through steps would be available. what follows is a high level user story:\n\nUpon registering the user would be asked to \u2018select from location type\u2019:\n\nurban, suburban, fields\n\ninput some rudimentary details\n\n- your location\n\n- space you have to grow\n\n- direction of area (N,S,E,W)\n\n- is it outside / inside / windowsill etc\n\nApp would then ask you if you have any pots to grow things in, pots, planters etc.\n\nIf not will recommend types of ones to buy, or suggest homebrew planters - appropedia / homegrown evolution style things to build or use.\n\nbased on the data the app would then recommend seeds and what to grow etc / especially favouring local varieties.\n\n\u00a0\n\nonce you have followed the advice, you tell it what and where you have planted, how much etc and click GrOw\n\nperiodically the app will remind you to water and feed your plants (could it use local open local weather data to estimate this better?)\n\nwith every interaction between you, the app and the plant, it should prompet you to input some data about its progress; approximate height etc - and who doesn't want to take photos of the things they have grown to show people?!\n\nat the end when you are ready to harvest your food, you will be asked to input some details like final height of your plant (if applicable) weight of the harvest, perhaps even ask some subjective questions / rate taste of your food etc.\n\nalongside the core function of the app is a network - this network would allow you to share the photos of the things you are growing. rough geo-data could be used to make sure your photos are seen by other users locally around you; you can see their photos and plants too and should be able to comment and rate it.\n\nevery interaction from watering your plants, to commenting on and offering advice to other users should give you \u2018points\u2019 or some kind of \u2018reputation points\u2019. indeed, using a 2 user conformation system - meaning if to people verify your photo of your plant. all three of you get points (this also maintains the integrity of the network information) - as an aside: geolocated flirt/dating apps like skout have perfected the art of creating perceived value of points inside their networks for simple interactions.\n\nas people verify other peoples photos - with priority given to people local to you - users should begin to feel connected to the growers around them. this is the soft network.\n\nthe hard network comes in with the reporting of yields for example - perhaps excesses can be donated to/picked up by transition towns if you join the transition suppliers group for example (this of course will give you more points) . this feature can then tap in to existing hard networks of people working on long resilience.\n\nUrban farms could all have a presence on the network promoting their learning sessions and experience. There are so many small hyper local community gardens, permaculture groups etc that could all have a presence on this kind of network; these real world social hubs are all doing amazing things around the globe and are important in growing the hard resilience of the network.\n\nPerhaps the app could have badges for completing \u2018missions\u2019 donating x amount to transition towns, or some other local scheme to you. successfully \u2018growing out\u2019 and returning seeds from Seed Savers, build a window farm etc... i\u2019m sure there are lots of possibilities.\n\nThe network that connects you to other local growers that sits alongside the core \u2018tell you exactly what to do\u2018 primary function of the app i think is a great opportunity for connecting not only people, but the many different groups that are working in the resilience field.\n\nAnyway just an idea.. if you like it, let me know.\n\nas i\u2019d quite like to find some people to build it with..\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-12 21:18:40", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 13:40:06.938485", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 957, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 25.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10769, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 6348, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>I can be in on the call</b>\n\nDon't have images really, but I can be present for the call on Weds.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-05 14:47:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:02.171870", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6831], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22726, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4724, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Ping</b>\n\n@Iriedawta for the above.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-07 08:48:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:06.375594", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 1.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22383], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15623, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4525, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Keeping the spirit alive</b>\n\nMy impression is that community is an important ingredient to \"keeping the spirit alive\". One very effective way of building relationships (community) and long lasting emotional involvement is to expose groups of people to emotional stress* (team building exercises).\u00a0\n\nSo once you have your database of initiatives up and running I would suggest to consider these things:\n\n1. \"Round robin day or week\" Where one or two people from one initiative volunteer for one of the others. This will strengthen cohesion, and info flow between the groups and also open up new perspectives.\n\n2. \"You can do it too! day\" Sometimes volunteer workers can inadvertently distance themselves from their regular peer group because they are involved so much with relief and reconstruction. This often has many negative knock-on effects later on - and perhaps just as important - misses the opportunity to bring someone fresh aboard (especially if the group consists predominantly out of \"veterans of the first hour\"). Feelings of guilt and shame may also present an obstacle, especially if there is no convenient occasion to bring this into a conversation.\n\nIdeally you can combine these two as the host organization has to break in someone from another background anyway. That way the \"new guy\" would not feel out of place, but sees that there is no \"magic\" involved anywhere. Perhaps you can get something like a school day off for people participating**.\n\n*You don't want to traumatize everyone in absolutely depressing and frustrating situations though. The subjective stress level is very variable - so it might be a good idea to start building it up gradually and not push people further than one should.\n\n**In Germany we had <a href=\"http://www.schueler-helfen-leben.de/de/home/links/in_english.html\">this</a>, where you essentially go and work for a day with the money going into some aid project.

(The main reason for this is that Drupal is made mostly for publishing, it's hard to do interaction with it.) The new basis, which is Ruby on Rails, is much better for developing interactive web applications, so in principle we can have a custom one at some point. However, we need to know exactly how it should be, and creating it will not be in the budget for this initial new platform (it won't add more than 4000-5000 EUR either, however).\n\nFor now, @Nadia decided to stick with <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/\">Eventbrite</a> for ticket sales, and Matrix instant messaging for collaboration around the event. The main new edgeryders.eu platform will have static pages where admins can post anything about the upcoming event and tell people how to get their tickets on Eventbrite and collaborate on Matrix. There will not be publicly editable wikis, though.\n\nOur events are quite complex projects, and I think any old-fashioned business would try a project management software here. That's probably not for us though, as this kind of software will feel formal, not fun. However, I have to install <a href=\"https://www.openproject.org/collaboration-software-features/\">OpenProject</a> on our server today anyway as the tool of choice for making our MENA YP Gantt charts. You may then have a look if you like it as backend solution for the core team to keep track of the event preparations. It's basically the best open source project management suite available, and also made in Ruby. So if people really really like it, we can do some integrations with our new Ruby-based platform. Such as a public task list where people can take over tasks for event preparation.

Individuals farther away from the mainstream are less shielded from systemic change (mass unemployment, ecological crises, etc.), and therefore harder pressed to respond and adapt to it; at the same time, they are also less constrained by \"business as usual\". In the 21st century, the spread of hacker culture \u2013 with its emphasis on DIY, knowledge sharing and technological progress has turned on a spotlight on a small but influential minority of social innovators, activists and technologists that are emerging as a massive, distributed R&amp;D lab for the global society. There is much to be gained from a constructive dialog between the center, where policies are decided upon, and the edge, where people at the forefront of change and adaptation are gathering precious data on what change really looks like from the inside. However, bootstrapping and sustaining such dialog is challenging. Profoundly different world views and experiences separate policy makers and innovators at the edge; a history of mutual mistrust makes each side weary of engaging with the other.\n\nEdgeryders grows out of a joint Council of Europe/European Commission project to bridge this gulf. The approach we advocate \u2013 and that we have successfully deployed elsewhere \u2013 is based on three main activities:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>traversing the social graph</strong> to reach cutting-edge trends and their protagonists just as they happen. Social innovators, hackers, civic hackers and activists tend to be a global community, connected across the planet by personal ties. We make use of the many edgeryders who are themselves part of it to identify individuals in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia \u2013 as well as working with relevant UNDP country offices \u2013 to act as entry points to the networks of innovators in those countries; and of the social Internet to traverse the social graph, using their early involvement to signal to other, less visible innovators what we are doing. Each step is validated through the credibility of the people passing the word around, generating an initial investment of trust: its collateral is the positioning of so many edgeryders in this community.</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>peer-to-peer validation</strong> through a curated online conversation. Cutting-edge projects and experiences are shared on an online platform optimized for meaningful conversation, with unrestricted (but moderated) comments. This means that the Spot The Future (STF) community functions as its own validation mechanism: anything written by one user can be corroborated or challenged by all other users. This is the same mechanism at work in open source software development, that famously prompted Linus Torvalds to remark that \"given enough eyeballs, all errors are shallow\". This assures highest quality and timely error- and bias detection.</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>conversation harvesting through online ethnography and network analysis techniques</strong>. Qualitative (ethnographic) analysis is deployed on the many voices participating into the online STF conversation, to identify the trends and criticalities that innovators at the edge in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia find most compelling. We supplement this with quantitative indicators: social network indicators (computed on the conversation, not on mainstream social networks) to best assess the influence of individual participants, and content network indicators (such as H-indices) to best assess the depth and the breadth of the peer-to-peer validation processes underpinning each contribution to the conversation. We also prototype a method to combine social network and document network, based on a recently proposed network measure called entanglement. .</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The platform, the people, the hosting culture</h3>\n\n<span>In\u00a0</span><strong>deliverable 2</strong><span>\u00a0we will design and deploy the technical and social infrastructure appropriate for the exercise.\u00a0</span>\n\n<h4>Online platform</h4>\n\nWe suggest deploying the project on a dedicated section of the Edgeryders platform (<a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu\">https://edgeryders.eu</a>). Besides being a fast, cost-effective solution compatible with the time and budget constraints of STF, it has two added advantages. Firstly, unlike any existing national platform, it brings together innovators and hackers in all three STF countries, maximizing the opportunities for interaction with each other and with many of their Western European counterparts. Secondly, it stays at arm\u2019s length from UNDP: it can make bold decisions and live with their consequences. A partially separate identity lets UNDP take credit for the exercise\u2019s success if it succeeds, and yet shelters it from the fallout of failure should it fail. This means we can build a truly innovative prototype with no risk to compromise the client\u2019s credibility. We employed the same strategy with Edgeryders vs. the Council of Europe, Kublai vs. the Italian Ministry of economic development etc. The Edgeryders platform is:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\talready up and running</li>\n\n<li>\t\tfree, open, user friendly</li>\n\n<li>\t\tenjoys high-grade tech support</li>\n\n<li>\t\tinhabited by a diverse community of close to 2,000 people, predominantly young and European. The existing Edgeryders community is likely to take interest in STF, thereby reducing the \"empty room effect\" and speeding up takeup.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tfully customizable</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nFor the STF exercise we propose creating and customizing a group within Edgeryders (with its own URL); fitting it with support for multiple languages and one-click machine-translation (see below).\n\nWe provide a content-level integration with the World We Want platform as follows: World We Want is based on Drupal (according to fingerprinting in its HTML source), as is the Edgeryders infrastructure. This means that the standard way of migrating Drupal content (the Drupal Migrate project: <a href=\"https://drupal.org/project/migrate\">https://drupal.org/project/migrate</a> ) is a comfortable way to get this integration done without any loss of structure or metadata like author, date and reply-to information. We already have extensive experience with Drupal Migrate. For the World We Want application, we would develop a custom Drupal module that can be installed by the administrator of World We Want to install and update the content generated in this project. If desired, these content imports can run in regular intervals (say, hourly, called automatically). Drupal Migrate automatically works in such a way that only new content will be imported in such a case.\n\nIn addition, relying on Drupal and Drupal Migrate makes it possible to include the content generated for this project into the data pool available for analysis with the World We Want Discover tool. On our end, this means tagging the content (through Drupal taxonomies) with content type, region and topic, and also importing this information during the Drupal Migrate import. No action is required at the side of World We Want administrators to allow the analysis, other than an initial agreement on compatible data structures.\n\nFor all the above tasks of integration, we will develop the import tool with a sandbox version of World We Want before handing it to the World We Want administrator for live use.\n\n<h4>Engagement: people and culture</h4>\n\nAny\u00a0distributed foresight effort needs a way to attract and engage many contributors. In\u00a0the case of<span>\u00a0Spot The Future there is a further complication: the exercise happens across multiple countries and multiple languages. Fortunately, we have faced similar situations before. We address this challenge as follows:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><span>we employ an <strong>engagement manager</strong> in each country. These roles are defined by embeddedness in the local social innovation/civic hacking scene; proficiency in the local language; and social media traction. The role of engagement managers is to point us at people doing interesting work in their respective countries; \"put the word out\" on the country's most used social media</span>, inviting their countrymen and -women to the conversation; and taking part in it themselves. \"Social media\" in this\u00a0context means essentially Facebook \u2013 the likely exception being Egypt, where 2% of the country's 30 million Internet users are active Twitter users (source: <a href=\"http://goo.gl/Xyfi4X\">http://goo.gl/Xyfi4X</a>).</li>\n\n<li>we procure, in each country, <strong>paid content</strong> \u2013 asking some of the more interesting innovators to share their experiences and vision in the form of blog post to be posted on the Spot The Future platform. These posts act as seed for the nascent conversation.</li>\n\n<li>we employ an experienced <strong>community manager</strong> to assist new participants in the onboarding process and help them become protagonists of the conversation (guidelines:\u00a0<a href=\"http://goo.gl/DuiVf2\">http://goo.gl/DuiVf2</a>). Edgeryders believes in a \"human touch\" approach to community, exemplified by the\u00a0\"call a human\" button on our home page.</li>\n\n<li>we <strong>weave a narrative</strong>: engagement is more likely to happen when there is a powerful story to attract participants to the project, outlining a common purpose and key values of the interaction space: openness, inclusiveness, tolerance and respect. The narrative in the case of STF will emphasize participants as protagonists of a global conversation and future spotters lending their unique expertise to better policy outcomes. Conveying the narrative is to be done through inspirational blog posts, calls for participation spread by the team and engagement managers, as well as customization of the web platform\u00a0(graphics and other visual and textual cues).</li>\n\n<li>we <strong>invite the existing 2,000-strong Edgeryders community to participate</strong>, making the exercise more exciting and advanced for everyone, furthering opportunities for peer to peer learning and support, as well as collaboration that can extend\u00a0beyond geographic boundaries. Content in the platform is linked to accounts, so it is easy to separate content by users in STF countries from that of other users.</li>\n\n<li>we <strong>deal with multiple languages </strong>as follows: key content (basic info, how-tos) will be in Armenian, Arabic, Georgian and English. Procured blog posts will be in the language of the country they refer to and English. Users will be given the choice to\u00a0write in English or in any other language; one-click automated translation will be made available on the platform. A strong social norm of not looking down on anyone on the basis of spelling or grammar mistakes will be in place.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Research strategy</h3>\n\n<strong>Deliverables 3 and 4</strong> are produced by means of\u00a0an <strong>open online ethnography</strong> exercise, with some quantitative reinforcements. Ethnographic methods are particularly well-suited to horizon-scanning exercises because they allow researchers to convey the point of view of the group being studied into the research. In the case of STF, this promotes constructive dialog between policy makers and innovators at the edge, as it makes explicit the different world views standing in the way of collaboration.\u00a0Also, it tends to amplify weak signals by looking at\u00a0(in this case) social innovation through the eyes of social innovators, taking on board the reasons why their initiators think these practices and experiences are important.\u00a0It entails the following steps:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>generating (broadly defined) questions.</strong> Presumably based on the priorities emerging from the post-2015 consultation run by UNDP, they are likely to focus on \"how\" to do things, for example \"how to define high-quality education opportunities? how to provide them to all?\"</li>\n\n<li><strong>seeding a community</strong> to take them on (as explained above).</li>\n\n<li><strong>peer-to-peer validation</strong> all across the project (see above).</li>\n\n<li><strong>ethnographic coding</strong>: platform content is parsed by ethnographers and coded according to a pertinent ontology.\u00a0<span>We have worked in the past with ethnographers from various European universities, but we are also willing to consider a collaboration with researchers in Armenia, Egypt and Georgia. </span></li>\n\n<li><strong>analysis of coded content</strong> to single out the most important and\u00a0most widely shared attributes of innovators at the edge and what they do</li>\n\n<li><strong>computation of network metrics</strong> for further validation of the online content. This\u00a0takes advantage of the fact that the ethnographic data are, originally, in relationship with each other (posts respond to research questions; comments respond to posts or other comments)<span>, and therefore can be conceptualized as a network. This network of content implies a social network of people talking to each other. We intend to study both the network of contents and the social network, using computer code from Cottica\u2019s Edgeryders Mapper (https://github.com/dragontrainer/edgeryders-mapper)t and Renoust\u2019s Data Detangler (</span><a href=\"http://tulipposy.labri.fr:31497/\"><u>http://tulipposy.labri.fr:31497/</u></a><span>). Quantitative network analysis complement qualitative ethnography in three ways: it validates qualitative conclusions by assigning an influence score to individual participants in the conversation (via centrality measures in the social network); assigns a reliability score to units of content (via h-indices or similar in the content network); uncovers the patterns of co-occurrence of ethnographic tags, leading to a fine-grained understanding of how the different social innovation, values, and issues are </span><em>socially</em><span> connected \u2013 in other words, finding out what makes \u201cinnovators at the edge\u201d a social group (via entanglement measures).</span></li>\n\n<li><strong>online publication of drafts</strong>, one for each country,\u00a0for the whole STF community to discuss,\u00a0draw parallels and validate.</li>\n\n<li><strong>further validation in the course of a physical meetup</strong> of representatives of the STF community across the three countries (see below).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThis process has several desirable characteristics.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>open</strong>: anyone can participate in the study, not just as a respondent but as a researcher as well. In fact, respondents are encouraged to put on a researcher's\u00a0hat. This happens through two mechanisms.\u00a0The first one is the accessibility of the research process itself through a kind\u00a0of open notebook science, with researchers publishing their provisional results on the platform itself as they go, giving everyone a chance to have a say. The second one is the publication of the coded data in open formats (though anonymized.\u00a0A discussion about the privacy issues of open notebook ethnography in the context of Edgeryders can be found here:\u00a0<a href=\"http://goo.gl/Hn5nD5\">http://goo.gl/Hn5nD5</a>).\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>accessible</strong>: since the exercise lives online, any citizen can participate in it at her own pace, in her own time slot, from wherever she chooses to.</li>\n\n<li><strong>computation-friendly</strong>: the raw ethnographic data are generated in written form and on an online platform. This means saving time and money in transcription; it also means being able to perform more sophisticated analysis by being able to associate every post or comment to its user, and ideally each user to a vector of characteristics (age, gender, country, education...).</li>\n\n<li><strong>fair</strong>: ethnographic research has a strong mandate to incorporate the point of view of those being studied in the results. This makes it especially suited for fostering dialog and building trust.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>robust:\u00a0</strong>quantitative indicators<strong>\u00a0</strong>reinforce and supplement qualitative analysis with insight that is prone to different biases than qualitative analysis itself.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Final event</h3>\n\nA three day Living on the Edge event (video: <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/82554988\">https://vimeo.com/82554988</a>), fostering mutual support and horizontal learning that gathers innovators from different parts of the world. The contents of the event will be based on the online conversation and co-designed by the STF community on its platform, by and with attendees. The event will be open for anyone who wishes to participate in it; especially active or inspiring contributors to the STF exercise will be funded to participate.\n\n<h4>Goals</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Build and share across the participants a synthesis of the qualitative evidence being uploaded onto the online platform</li>\n\n<li>Experiment involving participants from different countries as mentors to each other, expanding one another's knowledge and acting as a mutual support network for innovators working outside structured/funded r&amp;d environments</li>\n\n<li>Experiment involving Edgeryders community members as full-fledged experts in the projects, by getting them to present their stories and activities and discuss them with other event participants</li>\n\n<li>Confront contributors and mentors with the data and bring them up to speed with respect to building the final foresight report</li>\n\n<li>Plan the final phase of producing the final foresight result</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Expected outcomes</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The emergence of a fledgling network connecting innovators at the edge across the selected countries</li>\n\n<li>Discovery and exchange of new perspectives, knowledge and themes amongst participants</li>\n\n<li>Discovery of new \u201csocietal solutions\u201d and their challenges across countries</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Tentative schedule of activities</h3>\n\nOnline interaction social dynamics has its own laws of motion, that are not necessarily compatible with traditional \u201cwaterfall\u201d project management. That, in addition to the tight time constraints of STF recommends a tight management of the project\u2019s timeline, as well as some overlapping between the different phases. We envision completing the project in three months, roughly as follows.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Week 1.</strong> Plan activities</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Weeks 2-5</strong>. Complete the research and engagement teams; produce \"seed\" content and calls for participation in multiple languages; prepare the platform; build the data model</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Week 3</strong>. Pre-launch activities: start a blog, establish a STF social media presence etc.</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Week 6</strong>. Platform launch; preliminary foresight report</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Weeks 7-10.</strong> \"On tour\": missions to Armenia, Egypt and Georgia, for small scale offline meetings and community animation. Driving online engagement. Start ethnographic analysis. Start the network analysis.</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Week 12</strong>. Final event to present and validate preliminary research conclusions.</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Week 13. </strong>Complete the network analysis and finalize the report.</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2014-01-04 17:35:32", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:11.904989", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3187, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3234, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 3201, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span><span>About 2 years ago this month, myself and other EdgeRyders held a session at \\#LOTE1 an event not dissimilar to the event taking place in Tblisi this week.

MerabRoom is the room with art from an artist named Merab. KitchenA is the kitchen closest to MerabRoom. <a href=\"http://fuckupontheedge.eventbrite.com\">FUCKUPNIGHT</a> will also be in MerabRoom and the bar to get drinks will be in the garage, which happens to also be the entrance so there is no way you will miss it.\n\nDAY 2: COFFEE will be downstairs by the coffee machines. Starts with an opening note by John Coate in the PlenarySpace. This is the space above MerabRoom. After that, all OpenCare sessions will be in Hackistan, which is code language ( :-) ) for the attick. All sessions under finance/culture will be in AddOn, the room that's next to PlenarySpace. All sessions under development will be in BrightAndShiny, the room that's a bit more difficult to find but has excellent large windows. Lunch will be in Merabroom. MerabRoom and PlenarySpace are open all day for people to chill out or have impromptu sessions. SOIREEMOLENBEEK is our evening activity. It will, no surprise here, be in Molenbeek, in an artcoworkingspace called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lavalleebxl/?fref=ts\">LAVALLEE</a>. We will have Levantstyledinner and then go explore this lovely confusing spot on earth filled with poverty, creativity and some jihadi-loving imams.\n\nDAY 3: Much the same as day 2 for room attribution. With the exeption that for democracy/finance/culture we will probably use MerabRoom or PlenarySpace to be able to accomodate everyone and we will extend to KitchenB to keep up with lunchmaking.<a href=\"/t/program/5033\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/program</a> BURNYOURFUCKUPS is our evening activity in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/elzenhof/?fref=ts\" style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19.2px; line-height: 32.64px;\">Elzenhof</a>, which start with a tasty disco soup\u00a0and then proceed to the Belgian winter tradition of having beers around bonfires - we'll make sure everyone has pen and paper to write down their past \\#fails and throw them into the bonfire to \\#unfail them once and for all.\n\nDAY 4: UNCONFERENCE: we start in PlenarySpace at 10 to pitch ideas and choose where we go. We have loads and loads of coffee, probably. De-Hangover-Packages in the shape of tab water will be at hand. We have until 18h before we will gently be asked to evacuate the building and leave it to the working people on Monday.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: there are not that many chairs around, so we'll be moving them about quite a lot.

The fear of losing their job. I agree with you, it is the core of the problem. Fear deprives people of choice. Fear shrinks the world into defensive enclaves. Fear spirals out of control. Fear makes everyday life seem clouded over with danger. Freud said that anxiety is the mind's most unwelcome guest. These are boom times for unhappiness. Massive unemployment that lingers... dragging recovery, etc. Many people consider the future with fear. The population living in industrialized countries has lost faith in optimism. A major problem is that not enough leaders are warning the population that it\u2019s the worst possible reaction.\n\nFear isn't all bad. There is a positive side to fear. When one faces fear, he/she can choose to get out of it.\n\nWe have seen in the past that economic bad times were solved by holding our breath and waiting for money to flow back in. That kind of strategy will probably not work this time. When there is less in the way of material advantages, it becomes easier to make the distinction between happiness and comfort\u00ad.\n\nIs there not something odd about our fear of losing our \u201cconsumer buying power\u201d? Why don't we use this situation to realize that we went too far with the consumerist mania? Instead of mourning about profit margins, can't we use the slowdown to ask ourselves what makes for true personal happiness?\n\nAn impoverished country like Nigeria scored number one in a survey of the happiest countries on earth. (See <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2011/jan/04/nigerians-top-optimism-poll\">Nigeria, the happiest place on earth</a>)\n\n\"A global survey has confirmed it: in a 53-country Gallup poll, Nigerians were rated at 70 points for optimism. By contrast, Britain scored a deeply pessimistic -44. Why so glum, Britain? And what in the world makes Nigerians so happy?\"\n\nI don\u2019t know why we need a crisis to bring out those fundamental human qualities in us. But we often do. Growth is driven by the flame of discontent. It's up to each individual to begin to grow on their own, by facing the problem of fear first. No crisis was ever solved by contracting and hiding in fear. The solution comes from expansion. Before we can dream about the expansion of the economy, there is another kind of expansion that must take place first.\n\nWhat the heck is happiness?<span> Have gov leaders asked themselves this question? <span>What is it made out,</span> <span>happiness</span><span>?</span></span><span><span> There</span> is <span>something</span> <span>bothering me.</span> <span>Let us suppose that governments</span> <span>could begin to talk</span> <span>of about resilience</span><span>,</span> but <span>have no idea</span> <span>of what is happiness</span><span>,</span> the nature of happiness, <span>the roots of happiness, what</span> <span>it can leads</span> us <span>to</span><span>,</span> what it does in the brain, what it does in the human body, how it transforms a human being, how it transforms a community, how it impacts on the economy, how it impacts on global health, how it can transforms a whole society, <span>HOW WILL THEY BE ABLE TO IMAGINE A VISION OF THE FUTURE?</span></span>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-04 01:49:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:44.668176", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 624, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24062, "user_id": 116, "topic_id": 2519, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>so what is next</b>\n\nso alberto which is the reason they havent done? you feel they are able to deal with this people in order to make fundraising if they know who is the proper person ton talk to?\n\neni is sensible to institutitions...eni si also a structured comporation so after firts contact and informal expalnation a document woth a proposal should follow fast..and appelaing..\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-22 15:23:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:13.376820", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 73, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28905, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4255, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>Exactly</b>\n\nAgree with Noemi.

Being Greece's second biggest city, and the largest city of the country's North, Thessaloniki boasts with life, with a vibrant culture that is merging optimally the city's laid back flair, with its\u00a0rich history, the university\u00a0community and contemporary culture. In the last years, Thessaloniki is emerging as a lively incubator of several grassroots initiatives. The first urban gardening projects of Greece happened here, when a group of citizens occupied a former army camp. Social enterprises, consumers networks, activist groups\u00a0and a significant arts scene are here at home.\n\nThe workshop took place on September 3rd, 2016, inviting socially active citizens in the wider field of care.\u00a0In many cases, these people are not strangers to each other. The city is neither too big, nor\u00a0too small, and people that care are often meeting each other in the numerous gatherings, events and activities organised at the grassroots.\n\n\u03a4he workshop offered an open space to meet and discuss, using several tools\u00a0for harnessing collective intelligence.\u00a0Using various participatory methodologies, such as World Caf\u00e9, participants mapped out the status quo, how they would imagine Care in Greece in 10 years from now, while engaging into framing this transition.\n\n<b>Mapping the status quo</b>\n\nThe current care system of Greece is characterised by mainstream centralised structures defined (and accepted) by the public health system, marked by chronic problems related to inefficiency, corruption and lack of funding. The severity of the ongoing financial crisis in Greece has further incapacitated the public care system, but it has given rise to a milieu of social, citizen-led projects who leverage volunteerism to care for the most under-privileged parts of the society.\n\nBesides public hospitals and private clinics, these structures harbour initiatives ranging from non-profit actions\u00a0by international and domestic NGOs or philanthropic organisations (including the church), to volunteer initiatives and informal groups. Over the last years, such initiatives have focused on the distribution of primary need goods (ie. clothes, food, education), based on a strong narrative around the solidarity and exchange economy. In parallel with citizen-led initiatives, many city councils have launched municipal Social\u00a0Grocery\u00a0stores or Pharmacies. In many cases, local community action is combined with public social structures.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b7895260d1c3ea708438bd82d25b036f28c52cc9.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\n<strong>Citizen imagine Care in Greece in 10 years</strong>\n\nCitizens were asked to engage into collaborative dialogue on the future of care in Greece, using the World Caf\u00e9 method. Participants were divided in two groups and shared ideas on different and multi-level care structures. People from one group swapped with the other, in oder to cross-polinate their knowledge which was later harvested to reveal interesting connnections between different aspects of care.\n\nThe new paradigm focuses on synergies at different levels, putting emphasis on notions and ideas that bring people together, build trust, strengthen relationships in communities. From the level of housing,\u00a0neighbourhoods and\u00a0schools, all the way to managing structures of public health and social care. Interesting ideas were shared from participants, for example how we can train care stuff in novel and specialised approaches such as \"preventive\" mourning. Others talk of the need for communal spaces in blocks of flat, where residents can share tools or creative moments, enhancing social interaction in the buildings they live.\n\nFor the participants, the future of care innovation\u00a0is closely connected to openess and the availability of public space. Not surprisingly, many people appreciated the power of urban gardening in offering green spaces, but also in building a sense of community in the neighbourhood.\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3a21d9a997a1370082ddc98f72c4f52b37704cc8.png\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\nThe transition to such a system is not without obstacles, especially by virtue of the lack of political sense in the crisis-stricken country that is experiencing the deepest recession since World War II. Nevertheless, after\u00a07 years of fighting the crisis, some cells inside the society start having a very clear idea about the pathway forward.\n\nTo visualise these\u00a0change dynamics, participants were asked to engage into <strong>Transition Framing</strong>, investigating aspects of the care system that should be continued, eliminated, improved or complemented.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9dd72595cbd999f670985f21d63fda5835593c17.png\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\nThe care communities of Greece are the unsung heroes of this crisis. They formed quickly, evolve slowly and are present where both and the public sector fail: providing free, open care to the most sensitive target groups (ie. homeless, elderly, immigrants). Given the financial, political and administrative support they diserve, these communities could transform the game, and offer the hope of recovery to all Greeks, but also Europe as a whole.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-05 15:44:39", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 10:56:25.054238", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 897, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 31.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29668, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 6096, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>doodle</b>\n\nHi @costantino !

And in any design, there are some guidelines that proved to work well in earlier projects and in history. The following one affects my view on data: to not give central instances and organizations any large amount of control over you, because there's always the chance that the wrong people get into power, freak out and totally misuse their powers.\n\nPerhaps I'm more aware of this \"design rule\" than others (and perhaps a bit too much), as I'm from a country that was Nazi Germany just some decades ago, and there was still a vivid discussion about that time while I was in school ... . Anyway, it seems fair to say that central authorities should not get any more power (by data like here, or by tech) than absolutely necessary for their legitimate tasks. Just look at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDECT\">INDECT</a> as a counterexample: a European \"homeland security\" project that, if fully developed and should the wrong people rise into power again, would make a good best population suppression system. Such tech, or anything similar with the abuse potential of a nuclear bomb, must not even be developed, ever!!\n\nOn a meta level, maybe it boils down to this: You hope and expect that people will be overall illuminated, good, kind, well-meaning in the future. I hope and maybe expect that too, but prepare for the opposite as a means of resilience. Being a resilient society is: protected against changes to the worse, resilient when undergoing bad times, always working towards changes for the better ...\n\nP.S.: How does it feel to live in a country that has like 1/70<sup>th</sup> the population density as mine? Does one feel there's a freedom so vast that it just cannot go away? ;) Maybe that question sounds silly, but maybe you have experiences that relate to this, or a comparison with a longer time of living in a densely populated area ...\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-09 17:22:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.085094", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 390, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17638, "user_id": 78, "topic_id": 1533, "post_number": 4, "raw": "this is a great article noemi.\n\nhope the rest of the gang will find some time to read through. \n\nsuffice to mention these trends.\n\nOrthodoxies --&gt; New Freedoms\n1.

Very good talk.\n\nShe predicted that the next step for Mankind - with the help of technology - is that we will jump into a different dimension, we will gain the ability to walk outside the Real (as we know it to explore new spaces).\n\nI totally agree with this.\n\nMankind is currently on an accelerated path to evolution.\n\nFrom Sherry Turkle's presentation, I feel FEAR. At the beginning of her talk, she mentioned the reactions of fear that people had 30 years ago. The aversion to having a calendar on the computer. She is having the same fear about social media conversations!\n\nWe are not loosing anything. We are in the process of transforming into something more evolved, where conversations will be of a different nature perhaps. Instead of having a conversation with a fellow human being in the Real, we might have conversations in the immaterial, by connecting to our collective consciousness.\n\nThe fact of being constantly connected to other people, not just one or two people at once, but loads of people, brings all of us closer to our real nature. We are a localized part of a unified field. We have scientific evidence of this with the theory of non-separability. Nothing is separated. We are all connected with social media links, but in fact, there are solid links between everything in a another reality.\n\n<em>Does it serve our human purposes?</em>, asked Sherry Turkle. YES, it does. It pushes the whole humanity towards a virtual state of being, a physical state of consciousness.\n\n<em>Do we risk loosing our capacity for solitude that energizes?</em> NO, we don't. Because by constantly expressing ourselves, we get closer to our dreams. More and more, we see the power of the internet transform democracy. The people are pulling down autocrats and selfish corrupted leaders. The power that energizes us is awakening in thousands of people at the present moment. We are walking toward a new era. And it is not the era of solitude.\n\n<em>Hopeless and passive?</em> We might be temporarily feeling helplessness in this difficult transition phase, but there are less and less people passive and indifferent to the affairs of the world. Look at the millions taking the streets. Where do these people come from? They march because of some connection to the internet, someone that convinced them to get up and protest.\n\nYes, <em>the path ahead is </em>INDEED <em>challenging</em>. The question we should ask: what type of Man are we evolving into? Toward what purpose? What will this mean, in your daily lives? What effect will it have on society, on business, on health, on the economy?\n\nRestart the necessary converstations. I don't mind giving it a try. But I wouldn't put all my eggs in this one basket. <em>I share therefore I am.</em> This could means something entirely different from what it is today.\n\nTo get back to your questions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>Autonomy</em>: there is a potential for gaining full autonomy, fueled by what 'energizes'.</li>\n\n<li><em>Mastery</em>: As this potential gets triggered, the process of transformation leads to mastery.</li>\n\n<li><em>Purpose</em>: The yearning to do what we do in service of something larger than ourselves. I have nothing to add to what you said about purpose, except that it is time for us to open our eyes, and realize that there is something larger than ourselves. It exists, it is inside us, it brings us life and energy. Through it, we are all connected to each other.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>Time to wake up and stop being afraid about the future!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-05 03:21:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:39.712639", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 805, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26107, "user_id": 2555, "topic_id": 4353, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>added you, </b>\n\nhi, added you and waiting for the call, :)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-07 09:17:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:24.776976", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15316, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2087, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Reassigning...</b>\n\n...and back again.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-11 18:27:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:26.223134", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23606, "user_id": 87, "topic_id": 1279, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Nice to see Poland on the move</b>\n\nI have been following the efforts in Poland and was extremely impressed by the open data day efforts.\u00a0 What were your takeaways from the event?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-28 02:17:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:11.008480", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 40, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30301, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 5571, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>the wiki is true</b>\n\nThe meeting is held June 21-22 at Stockholm School of Economics - See more at: https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/consortium-meeting-in-stockholm-including-travel#sthash.PrbWas11.dpuf\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-30 18:45:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:46.855638", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 38, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2619, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 2586, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>Okay firstly, I\u2019d like to make this a post on EdgeRyders because I think it would be useful - for the benefit of those with an outside view, the issues I\u2019m going to list are not endemic or a show stopper but more limiters of our own expectations. What we\u2019re finding on the ground is that 10+ individual projects is an enormous logistical strain, particularly within the time frame - not enough attention was paid to the invisible workload; translation, communication/advertising, (hidden) administration, managing the building, living etc.\n\nIt\u2019s also very apparent that the cultural frame most of us are operating in isn\u2019t applicable or effective in the context we\u2019re working - there\u2019s a need for a direct and clear ask to individuals we wish to collaborate with; permission mechanisms, it\u2019s clear we can\u2019t just say \u201cWe\u2019re open to anything and everything, just tell us what you want to do\u201d and expect it to happen.\n\nThis calls for a slight change of mentality. In order to be open we need to create the infrastructure for openness.\n\nFollowing a meeting we had earlier today a couple of problems arose that have a potential solution, I wanted to map these out within the framework of Job Descriptions but really we\u2019re talking about Collaborator Descriptions, because we act to reduce hierarchy.\n\nLet me explain roughly and we can build on this in discussion - this is a direct ask to the EdgeRyders community for support, shaping this effectively (and potentially for a workflow of direct support from the online community). If unMonastery is an offline presence for the EdgeRyders network, we need a sturdier bridge. </span>\n\n<strong>Issues identified:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Lack of collaboration within the unMonastery group (due to highly distributed projects)</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Language barrier </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Lack of capacity and support for individual projects</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Inability to effectively onboard people in a prolonged process </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Not enough people using the space outside of scheduled events</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Distributed workload for the same tasks across projects</span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Approaching a Solution:</strong>\n\n<span>Each project submitted to the unMonastery is a fairly well defined entity, they have individual objectives that are beginning to understand their audience, if we were working within a classic frame we could define each of these entities as companies. A Company needs employees to make it function. So what are the job roles within individual projects?\n\nI\u2019d like each of the unMonasterians currently present in Matera to outline 2-3 roles that they need to build their project, I\u2019m </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RL39eTOPlb5gs6Fj1ihYdXy5oo04wUFJg2Ykl60rP4o/edit#\"><u>providing a template</u></a><span>, but it\u2019s important to share the link to the ones you create in the the comments below, for visibility and role matching or copy and paste directly.\n\nIt\u2019s also absolutely crucial that jobs aren\u2019t constructed of the laborious tasks no one wants to do but rather a formalising of the connections already made - i.e you may need an advisor / troubleshooter who meets you for coffee 3 times a week. Routine and structure is needed.\n\nBe clear about your position and what\u2019s a fair partnership for collaboration - i.e \u201cI as an unMonasterian am working X hours, with X resources to make X happen, I do this because I want to make a difference to Matera. I would like to share these resources with you so we can make something happen together for similar objectives\u201d</span>\n\n<strong>How do we match Collaborator Roles with the issues identified? </strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Lack of collaboration within the unMonastery group:</strong>\n\n<span>Create the possibility for individual unMonasterians to take on the jobs you\u2019ve defined</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Language barrier: </strong>\n\n<span>Make Italian a requirement where necessary</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Lack of capacity and support for individual projects</strong>\n\n<span>Consider folding your own project into someone elses, in a way that you can share outcomes - i.e Maria makes a documentary video on how to set up Kei\u2019s Open Tech School</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Inability to effectively onboard people in a prolonged process </strong>\n\n<span>Use this as a direct ask and understand your responsibility in maintaining a relationship and showing love and respect to the people you\u2019re working with.</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Not enough people using the space outside of scheduled events</strong>\n\n<span>Create and team and this will solve itself overnight</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<strong>Distributed workload for the same tasks</strong>\n\n<span>Look at the Job descriptions other unMonasterians have outlined, could a job be shared across projects? </span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Now where do we recruit from? </strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>EdgeRyders community - comment, if you can take a role.</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Matera - now individual unMonasterians have a framework and direct ask, if wanted to go there, we could establish a week long effort focused on a recruitment drive.</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Where else??? </span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Desired Outcomes for Everything Above:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Create equal partners in projects who can feel ownership over projects and continue them once individual leaves </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>More successful projects </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Greater collaboration </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Realistic model for transition to people in Matera running the unMonastery beyond May.</span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>This was actually one of the most effective things I ever did in the run up to unMonastery Matera had I not done it \u00a0(</span><a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmonastery-roles-a-call-for-participation\"><u>see here</u></a><span>), I would have definitely drowned in work but is something I\u2019d forgotten as a reliable tool for project development. </span>\n\n<strong>Next Step:</strong>\n\n<span>What\u2019s our next step other than just going out and finding people? Do we bundle this as a call for participation, too formal? Do we ping all our existing networks? Do we approach existing organisations in Matera for support? </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-26 19:16:05", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 07:49:39.773746", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1286, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1438, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10988, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1836, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>And money is an abstraction.</b>\n\nThanks for the reminder to keep the focus on the product! After much talking about community development and business models and other meta-level things, I appreciate that. At the end of the day, all the other things become only relevant once there's a great product to offer ...\n\nFunny enough, \"Abstraction =&gt; bad\" has a second meaning for us, being a design principle in Economy App: we avoid money and any (resellable) debt because these are abstractions of value, and all such abstractions seem to open the door to gaming the system, including getting away with anti-social behavior. Or as Graeber puts it in his book: debt is a numerically expressed obligation. And only by being able to put an exact price tag on an obligation, it becomes possible to treat it purely objectively, ignoring the social relationship between debitor and creditor \u2013 for example by reselling the debt. (Graeber's \"Debt \u2013 The first 5000 years\" book is superb for inspiring the design of our software. Will take me some time to get through :P I have started reading it after [AD_admin] gave me tips on this and several good accounting books and walked me to <a href=\"http://www.foyles.co.uk\">Foyles</a>, the \"best bookstore in London\".)\n\nAs for barter and its use in societies: we call the algorithm \"network barter\", but that's about it. The user experience has little to do with bartering (no negotiations, no \"equivalence class\" finding for objects etc. \u2013 waiting for matches seems to be the only common property). My co-developer even wants to avoid the word \"barter\" completely on the platform. The experience is designed to be more like a new payment system: \"pay with your stuff and services\". If that holds true, it's not really about \"making barter work\" but \"designing a great trading mechanism\". More of a blank canvas than seems possible at first.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-30 20:35:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:03.361017", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 331, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10603], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12094, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3890, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Thank you and next steps</b>\n\nHi!\n\nthanks <a href=\"/u/danohu\">@danohu</a>.

The idea was to create a co-working space on a small scale to test the public, the audience, the traction of such a project. Co-working was one of the bricks that was needed for a previous project. And it seemed fitting in the continuation of Remi's experience as a volunteer for the language exchange club in Kyiv. He had a very active social role of connecting organizers and members of language conversation clubs, conversation meetings, in Ukraine.</h3>\n\nA co-working space, the way I see it, is a place where people can meet other people. You help them to connect with each other. It is a place where you don't come just for work, you can do that in a cafe, and in libraries, and so on. A place which is meant to interact with other professionals.\n\nSo, this is how the idea formed in the spring of last year. In the summer I prepared.\n\nThere was an element of personal challenge as well. I had been a volunteer for a few years, and I wanted to come back to business, but I didn't want to go back to the corporate world. So, this was a way to start an initiative as entrepreneur and to set up a business in Georgia. Georgia is a good country for that, it is easy to set up a business. There is more challenge in running a business and making money from a business, because the local market is very small. And this is something that I learned by doing.\n\nBut I am absolutely really happy with all that I have learned so far. And the mere fact that opening this business, this physical space, brought a lot of people that I wouldn't have met otherwise, entered the space. My accountant was passing in the corridor and she needed a charger for her phone, she entered, and a few months later she was my accountant. Without a physical space, I probably would not have met her. Now through her, I have connected foreign entrepreneurs with russian speaking and english speaking accountants.\n\nBusiness, I would say, from a commercial perspective, is still under what I was expecting, and not enough to break even. I have customers, but not enough. That's it.\n\nThe reasons could be many.\n\nSome of them are that the location of Co-spot is not obvious. It is not very far from the main street Rustaveli, but there is a psychological barrier coming here. Although it is the central hub of public transportation. Most of my customers are foreigner, not all of them, but most.\n\nFor Georgians, one element is cost, they do not have a lot of disposable income for a co-working space. Another one could be also the way they work. For the moment, they may rather have a private office for their business in order to have the freedom to address all the subjects they want the way they want it without concerns for neighbors and privacy. The constant dynamics of sharing and collaborative consumption is maybe less here than in some other countries.\n\nIn Ukraine, co-working works really well. I am setting up another business at the moment in Ukraine. I am not only working on this I am diversifying. We are trying to rent quite a large office in the center of Kyiv. And the prices in the center of Kyiv are less than prices that are not in the center here in Tbilisi. So the prices of real estate in Tbilisi are definitely an obstacle, for the model of a privately owned co-working space.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Remi is not completely alone anymore. He a colleague that works part time, and an accountant. It is also the first time that he has run something that customers come to.</h3>\n\nThe bills, the water, the supplies, the paper, the cleaning, this gives you a very down to earth approach. I like it. Doing a business which is not only service, or working from your computer remotely, working from your computer at your customers place. And that was also something for me that I really appreciate.\n\nI have been used to have quite a flexible lifestyle, going right and left where I want to, traveling often. This endeavour, this small initiative, pinned me down in Tbilisi for quite a while. Luckily now I have my colleague and I can go away for a few days to do other thigs. But, rather than saying that I don't like it, the constraint of being here and working at Co-Spot 6 or 7 days a week for months, was a good life experience.\n\nWhat I tremendously like about it, is the learning part. Georgia is a nice place to create a company. People, even if they don't understand what you are trying to do, even if what they are providing isn't what you asked for, they mean well. Usually. At a small scale at least, when there are not so many stakes. I've heard it can be different if you have a much larger company. I've also been learning a lot about creating a business. I have been in France a freelance corporate person. This was similar in some ways, the accounting and so on, but this one again: to have a physical space to run with, it made a big difference. I could have worked on the concept and said: \u201cWill I open a co-working space?\u201d and \u201cLet's try to create a community first\u201d which is actually the best practice. But I think I would still be trying to gather the right community, and probably would still have doubts whether it could work. But, sometimes you have to jump in. There was a leap of faith. An assumption in what I did. I will, probably, transition.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">On the long run, Remi believes that businesses have to make a profit, even it's not a big profit, or break even. And, this is what is sustainable.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">besides money,t he support Remi believes he could have used, might have been a Georgian partner.\u00a0</h3>\n\nIn Georgia, for the same business, if I wanted to push the envelope a bit, I would say we could have had a Georgian partner with their own community. Because it makes a big difference in how things work over here. When you want to find a job, when you want to set up a business, who you know and what they do matters. On the other hand, I would say that this could have made things easier, but then it would only reinforce the local culture functioning through your personal network.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">But a co-working space should be a place where you meet people you don't know, Remi believes. Professionals of all horizons, or professions, all backgrounds, that precisely cut across those networks that you have acquired through family, friends, extended family, university, and so on. He thinks the help of a local partner could have been usefull, but then the nature of their community would have mattered a lot.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">There are several other initiatives happening in Georgia and the South Caucasus.</h3>\n\nAt the moment there is a great initiative, it is called Generator 9.8. It's a non-profit Georgian organization who is setting this up. The four girls that are founders of the NGO, which is a few years old, want to have a social bar and co-working space. The bar will bring some revenue, whatever happens, and the co-working space functions on a different model. They want to make it very cheap for the co-workers, but rely on donations from private donors, institutions, to cover the costs.\n\nThere is also another initiative in Tbilisi, the new institute of Italian Culture. Tamaz wants to create a laboratory of ideas in and for Georgia. Connected to the institutions he is connected to in Italy, yes, but it doesn't have to be connected to Italy necessarily. So he wants to create a network of collaboration, self run. So people have responsibilities in the space. This is also an initiative that hopefully will attract people that would not necessarily have met otherwise. I think the style will be different. Like, the style of this office will be different from that of the generator, different of that of the institute of italian culture. There is space, room for many different kinds of co-working spaces to co-exist in Tbilisi.\n\nThe great thing about these two initiatives is that they are very open to collaboration and cooporation, exchanging, growing with each other.\n\nI am trying to share my experience with the Generator 9.8, they deserve it. They have a very good attitude. They also have uncertainties, because they don't have many funds for the initiative. Their openness is commendable. Also, as I have seen in Ukraine working as community organizer for a few years, if they can attract volunteers to help run the place, it's a showcase of what being a volunteer can bring you. It shows society that volunteering also has benefits. Not only for the community, but also for the volunteers themselves. Something that people, Georgians, do not have on their radar yet. Saying that you volunteered on a CV, that it will be looked at favorably, by any western employer or university.\n\nBut it is not only in Georgia that you have the experience of co-working in the south caucasus. Last year, in Yerevan, a student, Vachagyan, created Utopia Lab. I went to visit him, and it is interesting how different the whole thing works. First, he wasn't successful, and then he started anew, and now they have created a rather strong community of tech guys. Armenia has a strong diaspora, and foreigners are planning to open an impact hub in Yerevan this September, if I am not mistaken. Will they follow through? They don't seem to have a lot of connections with local communities, but the scene of co-working is also on the move over there.\n\nIn Baku, there is a co-working space that opened this January. Quite recent. I haven't followed it that much, I should go there and visit. It looked like they had a rather large space, and the founders already had some kind of backing. It should be interesting to see what happens over there as well.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what will happen in the South caucasus with co-working, which direction it will take. We'll see.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">And what about the concepts of mutual support and collaboration?</h3>\n\nMutual support and collaboration, they have been going on for a few thousand years. We are not inventing anything. Somehow we feel the need to come back to it. It is crazy. The concepts, I think, can be used and talked about for hours and they are not that useful. What is, is practical experiences, situations of collaboration and mutual support. If you don't make it happen, you can keep on talking but you don't bring any value to anyone. If you put it in practice, if you set up a space and you collaborate, if you try to foster mutual support along different lines, than those the society around you offers, then it has value. In Georgia I think, yes, there is a need. Because society is in, some aspects, rather conservative. And a lot of young people are used to functioning in their extended family environments. And co-working spaces in general can offer them a new experience. Something that may puzzle some of them at first. But, an environment where they will again probably not escape their traditional surrounding, social surroundings, but a way to establish contacts. And start looking at opportunities, work, businesses, in a new way.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-08-03 03:32:42", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 15:37:14.107533", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2109, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 40.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3700, "user_id": 1658, "topic_id": 3667, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<b>http://www.freethinkingzone.gr/\n\n@FreeThinkinZone</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2b1e73ebf3512d8c65fb824d9d2d93b24adc8733.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"492\"><br>\n\n<span><b>Interview with Areti, Free Thinking Zone </b></span>\n\n<span><span><b>Can you tell us about Free Thinking Zone and what are its main objectives?</b>\n\nFree Thinking Zone is a statement bookshop for contemporary art and thinking and at the same time an activist bookshop for liberty, social consensus and human rights. It started 2 years ago when Greece when the need for collaboration and a mutual understanding in the society was a main issue. And it still is. The level of tolerance on each others ideas and thoughts is very low. Free Thinking Zone aims at filling this social gap and this is exactly why it is located in a symbolic crossroad, the crossroad between Kolonaki square, where the wealthy people are hanging around and Exarcheia square where the most rebel and most intellectual part of the city leaves. Our aim is also to introduce new civilised rules in public dialogue, to promote fight against racism, discrimination, fear and violence, to promote the best, the most creative, the hard working and positive part of the town, through books! We also wish to enhance activism and personal responsibility on public life. We are now so self-absorbed that we take little interest in the world beyond our own lives. Until now we have organised a variety of debates on controversial and \u2018hot topics\u201d of the society. We are trying to build a community of different people who wish Greece to step ahead. This is why the agenda of Free Thinking Zone events is set mainly from our community members, our customers who at the same time are voluntarily organising activities based on each one\u2019s specialisation. </span></span>\n\n<span><span><b>What are the main challenges you have faced in the course of your work?</b>\n\nThe most difficult challenge that we are still trying to overcome is to convince all those people to sit at the same side of the table and discuss their differences. We don\u2019t want to make them change their point of view. We just want them to accept the fact that no matter how disgusting I find your opinion; you need to have the right to phrase it without fear. We are still far from that and this is why we are not always successful.\n\nThe second fight is to educate our public about the character of a statement/activist bookshop. There is no such concept in Greece and therefore it is hard for people to understand why we speak openly on issues related to our agenda. There are still some opponents who refuse this right to us who launch threats and insults etc. </span></span>\n\n<span><span><b>What mistakes have you made that you believe that others could learn from? </b>\n\nOur biggest mistake is that we should have asked for more from our volunteers at the beginning in order to build the community concept faster. </span></span>\n\n<span><span><b>What other projects, groups, organisations or networks do you see as an essential dependency or influencer on what you do? </b>\n\nThere are many: NGOs focused on transparency, liberty, human rights, alternative living, environment, universities, projects like yours, Rethink Athens, Basic Income Movement and political think tanks among others. </span></span>\n\n<span><span><b>What do you think will be the greatest challenge for the human race over the next 100 years? </b>\n\nA common humanity. How do we raise human consciousness so that we are one? As our global environmental status and religious differences magnify, we need to find a way to shift human consciousness towards the intention of a less aggressive and more cooperative world. </span></span>\n\n<span><span><b>Where would like to see Free Thinking Zone in the future? </b>\n\nI would like Free Thinking Zone to become a city \u201cmonastery\u201d, a cooperative venue which enhances social creativity, personal initiatives and activism right at the heart of a civil society. A breakthrough, \u201ca pain in the back\u201d of governments and fans of systemic old politics. A multicultural, multi-religious oasis. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-22 15:28:08", "updated_at": "2017-09-25 17:06:18.079625", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 775, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2344], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19371, "user_id": 1692, "topic_id": 2700, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Hi Massimo!</b>\n\nOk let me know what do you think of the specifications.

As was shown in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Salk\">Jonas Salk</a> 'The Anatomy of Reality', it is quite possible that the ability to look ahead, to think, reason, and try to gauge is sufficiently strong in a number of people to generate the existence of a critical mass, which will enabled to encourage humanity to respond to the challenges of changes more appropriately than we do today. Evolution of our societies is in our hands.\n\nWe probably all agree on this.\n\nHow can we do this, and get paid for it?\n\nAlberto, we had the same vision that you have of financial support mechanism, ie governments should pay for it with taxpayer's money.\n\nWe acted in line with this vision, and unfortunately we got lost in a maze of roadblocks, to finally run into a dead-end. At first, we had planned to go directly to the OIF. I knew from the start that it was useless to expect anything from Quebec. I figured that if everyone else turned open government, they would \"look stupid\", to use your own expression (as you mentioned in your report about the Spaghetti Open data). In a sense, we could say that what we proposed was a sort of You-will-look-stupid-if-you-don't-do-it strategy, a different approach from the one applied to Spaghetti open data, but nonetheless having some similarity (in the goals). But former secretary general of the umbrella organization explained us that there would be no listening from the headquarters, if we did not meet these 2 requirements:\n\n1) Obtain the agreement of 3-4 countries to participate in an experimental project;\n\n2) Engage vectors of this organization.\n\nIt made sense, what the former secretary general recommended. Get there with empty hands, without showing evidence of some grass-root support (in this case, it meant the States, and not just citizens), would have probably resulted in a rejection.\n\nTherefore, despite the insistence of my little finger which predicted me that we would crash into failure, we changed our course of action, and went knocking at the door of Quebec, because this province acts as Chairman of the main francophone vector, the association of parliamentarians.\n\nBefore we could explain our vision, we realized that we had first to explain what is an open government, and influence this government to accept and endorse these principles. Which is not even done yet, after 16 months of analysis.\n\nWe learned that there are pre-steps to open government. Analysis of open government is not a synonym of a future commitment. It does not necessarily lead to new policies and implementation of initiatives, especially when the highest levels of power remain indifferent to these issues. We also learned that leadership is an essential element of success in open government implementation.\n\nNow that the French Republic is building on open data and gradually adding, besides transparency, the 2 other components of open government, ie participation and collaboration (ref <a href=\"http://www.etalab.gouv.fr/article-enjeux-et-opportunites-de-l-open-data-97230888.html\">Enjeux et opportunit\u00e9s de l'open data</a>, \u00c9talab, January 16, 2012) , we could try again, go knock at the door of France, which has the role of executive secretary of the association of parliamentarians. We could go know at many doors...\n\nThis is all very well and very good, but are we do this for the next 30 years without pay? This strikes me as being very... euh... impractical.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-28 21:11:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:18.503930", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 703, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3070, "user_id": 105, "topic_id": 3037, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dc772f85cbd3deac6c30d43e562343b77b2716a2.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\nI decided to write about it while still in quite raw state.

I believe <a href=\"/makerfox\">Makerfox</a>\u00a0could greatly benefit from it just as any other service which helps people to share more! <a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOf course we wont get all that stuff of the ground in just few weeks! Still we can focus even further on creating a blueprint with simple toolkit for people who want to organize further DevSprints. I hope backed by various communities which we can interconnect through endeavors like Network of Networks. Also events like Living on the Edge, SenseCamps, OuiShare Summits etc. could greatly benefit from such toolkit and once again support its further development!\n\nIn context of Matera we have our <a href=\"http://matera.unmonastery.org/en/challenges1401015378202\">challenge \\#6</a>: \"<em>Lack of philanthropy and general inability on the part of many to raise funds\",</em> once we generalize it from <em>raise</em> <em>funds</em> to <em>secure assets</em>, we could contribute to <a href=\"http://matera.unmonastery.org/en/projects/sustainability-plan\">unMonastery sustainability</a> as well as prosperity of various other organizations/projects we collaborate with. Not to mention creating stronger foundation to continue\u00a0<a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/hacking-grant-competitions-to-award-communities\">Hacking Grant Competitions to Award Communities</a>\u00a0:)\n\nLast but not least we could create possibly <strong>major buzz</strong>\u00a0on social media around this event. With participation of various people engaging in <strong>Network of Networks</strong>\u00a0development, <strong>Decentralized Web</strong> groups and initiatives, <strong>Sharing Economy</strong> circles etc. I would happily take initiative in helping with arranging <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2013/10/19/learning-from-the-twitterstorm-an-architecture-for-effortless-collaboration/\">twitterstorm</a> around such event!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-25 11:10:29", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 05:37:37.072892", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 904, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 46.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 2161], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26234, "user_id": 190, "topic_id": 1309, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Perhaps I have not made it clear enough.

Started out as a German, I have lived in Denmark and Italy, and have relatives and a place on the westernmost part of Europe, the (Portuguese) Azores islands, where I stay for some months every year.\n\nI have also traveled quite a bit, in addition to having campaigned (unsuccessfully, I must admit) for freedom of individual choice in matters of supplementing our nutrition with concentrated nutrients like vitamins and minerals. The EU has passed restrictive legislation on supplements, as it has on herbs, and on natural medicines. It is that experience that makes me laugh at anyone who says that Europe can \"stand up to industry\". Those pieces of legislation were pharmaceutical (industry) inspired. Objective: to eliminate competition.\n\nI agree that there may be some circumstances where Europe can stand up to industry, but by and large, the EU is run by industry interests for industry interests. Word of someone who's seen some of the inner workings.\u00a0\n\nBut let's not get off the actual theme here: Vinay is right that Europe should be listening to its citizens and that - at this time - it apparently isn't.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-17 17:00:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:25.455035", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 231, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4566, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4533, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>This wiki is where we coordinate the work of building\u00a0<a href=\"/t/draft-new-book-on-networked-collaboration/4516\">\u201cNetworked collaboration on the Edge: The Alternative to Problem-Solving Leadership in Times of Crisis\u201d</a> - a digital handbook and collection of thought pieces that brings together cutting-edge solution-oriented leadership in areas of open source software, eco-friendly communities, non-transactional economies, urban agriculture/sustainability, collective intelligence experiments and more.</em>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">WHERE WE ARE GOING</h2>\n\nHow could we realistically support one another's work to scale up the impact of our individuals efforts at affecting change?

It means sharing honest accounts about what we are doing and the challenges we face, and using those stories to draw support to another's work. It also means stepping up and setting an agenda to honor what we are already doing, as well as a credible plan for realising it.\u00a0\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">HOW WE ARE GETTING THERE</h2>\n\nWe are using this wiki to facilitate a decentralised workflow in building different components of the collaborative book production so that anyone can participate regardless of where they happen to be on the planet.\u00a0\n\nIf you want to get involved just sign up on the platform, pick any of the tasks below and leave a comment to let us know you are interested.

This shift in strategy at the UN is the result of the hard work and passion many people put into the \\#futurerspotters project last year (read about it <a href=\"/t/we-talked-now-we-build-after-spot-the-future-and-lote4-edgeryders-is-hiring-from-armenia-belarus-egypt-georgia-morocco-and-ukraine/4370\">here</a>).\n\n<strong>The premise behind Future Makers is that we are already putting time and passion into projects for social good</strong>. And that the broad range of activities involved often fall outside what is normally thought of as volunteering. We feel those initiatives should be counted as forms of civic engagement and better supported.\u00a0\n\nThe formal, paid, deliverable to the UNDP and UNV is a report produced by Edgeryders co-founder Alberto Cottica (<a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>) in his capacity as a private consultant. The collaboratively produced book on networked collaboration is outside the scope of the contract with the client. We do it because we feel it is important to\u00a0produce something that is going to be directly useful to participants professional and personal development.\n\nOur reasoning:<strong> If we are to tackle inertia blocking changes we want to see happen, then we need to be humble about our own current limitations and help one another to level up our game on multiple levels in parallel</strong>. This requires honest, solutions oriented conversations between progressive decision makers at the centre and protagonists of promising initiatives at the edges. Peer to peer. This is why we are building this book with you.\n\nIt is difficult, messy and a lot of work. And totally worth it.\n\nWelcome on board.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-15 09:08:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:25.703323", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1107, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2577, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2544, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi all,\n\nThis has been a full week in terms of reporting and agreeing with each UNDP office on what the steps forward are.\u00a0It's not exactly where we could have been doing by now (especially in terms of country engagement), had it not been for the\u00a0delays which if needed we'll\u00a0<a href=\"/t/spot-the-future-team/357/finalising-engagement-manager/online-community\">capitalize on</a>\u00a0later.

Then something snapped last year. I felt unable and unwilling to not be sad and let others know what was going on and what I needed to be ok + how they could interact with me.

The players will run 3-4 hours when new and charged fully (usually have a tiny 70mAh x 3.7V LiPo battery). That will be more than enough for 1-2 lectures + some music for an entertaining and relaxing break.\n\nEach of the players will be used by a group of 2 students (usually girls, but if somehow possible I would love to include some boys into this as well e.g. some that have younger sisters to look after).\n\nOne can complement this \"intimate lecture\" by 1. a short intro for everyone via loudspeaker (also allows for questions to be answered for everyone). 2. A discussion period where the 2 students can ask each other questions and discuss things they did not understand. Then some can be interviewed e.g. in groups of 4 with 1 interviewer recording the discussion in order to have feedback for continuous improvement (I'd recommend doing 3 of these 4+1 format interviews: 1 with the smartest, 1 with the kids that likely had the most difficulty (and would likely be disruptive in a larger group), and 1 with random pairs). These interviews are not to grade the students but to find where most misunderstandings remain, and where the lecture needs to be improved or go deeper.\n\nThe other students can have a more regular question &amp; answer lecture. If you visit a group of approximately 50 students, you'd ideally have 2-4 people to run the hole thing. 1 to do the recorded 4+1 interviews one after the other, and 1 to deliver the interactive lecture.\n\nAfter the lecture you carefully check if you get all materials (including memory cards) back. Then they need to be charged for about 1 hour each using 5V and a mini-usb cable. One could also do a multi day event if there are enough power supplies there. The power supplies are probably among the most expensive things. ASIN: B00MLTTO6Y will do 4 x 5V USB for 6 EUR as step down from e.g. small a car battery, ASIN: B00K67X8PQ does 1 x 5V step up from e.g. 1-2 AA batteries for approx 1.50 EUR. (By the way these would also allow you to run or charge small USB-LEDs or other USB based items such as phones)\n\nAny super-old USB phone charger will likely also work fine because the power the mp3 players need is super small (10x less than most phones). Also the small solar panels can charge the battery directly in direct sunlight (just be careful things stay below 40 C).\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-26 23:10:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:38.251402", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 504, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 45.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28471], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1139, "user_id": 34, "topic_id": 1106, "post_number": 1, "raw": "So here I am after sort of following the Edgeryder community for many months and I will participate at \\#lote so I\u2019d like to tell you a bit about what I\u2019ve gone through the past year. There are so many threads and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to unwind them all.\n\nFor once I\u2019m going to try to write things out in public and not caring what other people may think. Although it sometimes feels like you put yourself on the line when there are search engines that makes sure you\u2019re indexable for eternity. I guess there is a beauty to that too. Everyone can be immortal now.\n\nI\u2019m now sitting on a train heading towards an internship. But I\u2019ll start from the beginning. Something like three years ago.\n\n<strong>Being a part of the climate movement</strong>\n\nThat was the time I got involved in the climate movement, it was the year of 2009. I had been studying Japanese for about three years with one of the years in Japan. After I got home from Japan in 2008 I had been studying some single courses like international relations and human ecology. After the course in international relations I had decided that I wanted to pursue political science.\n\nAt that time I was still thinking that I wanted to become a diplomat for a Swedish ambassador. My role model was and still is Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld who was general secretary for UN some 50 years ago. But over time my perception of him has changed from something I\u2019d like to become professionally to someone I admire. Which also reminds me of his wonderful book waymarks.\n\nBut as I was saying, the year is 2009 and I\u2019m pursuing political science. Firs term passed I started to get more involved in a student organization called H\u00e5llbart Universitet (in english: students for a sustainable university). I remember that I at one time was sitting in the countryside at a party, I think it was March or April. My now former girlfriend was there. We were enjoying ourselves. There was a person who had been involved in the climate movement for a long time. He was russian and had come here to study.\n\nWe talked and I thought it sounded really exciting, because it was. I guess I have a lot to thank him for in some ways. For being an enabler at that time. He invited us to go to Bonn, because the year 2009 there was going to be the big climate summit in Copenhagen when things were going to be solved. It was the big COP15.\n\nWe were organizing to be a part of the meeting in Bonn which was one of the many meetings that was a part of the whole procedure of UNFCCC (United nations framework on climate change).\n\nAnd I got the opportunity to be a part of a project called Adopt a Negotiator. It was and still is, although it has morphed slightly, a project designed as citizen journalism around the UNFCCC process. At the end of 2009 there were 14 young people covering UNFCCC from their country\u2019s perspective. They adopted their lead negotiator. Thus I had adopted my country\u2019s lead negotiator, the lead negotiator of Sweden.\n\nLooking backward, it felt like I was too small to fill the role. I had to grow fast to fill in the role. Perhaps it was around that time I started to feel that I wasn\u2019t able to do enough or the right things. It was the most stressful time of my life participating during those meetings. So much going on all the time, but at the same time, nothing. It was moving at a snail\u2019s pace.\n\nSheer frustration.\n\nPeople were talking. But nothing was happening. As you may know it\u2019s still going on, with little movement forward. The behemoth called UNFCCC with the jokingly slogan (UNF*C* the world).\n\nDuring second part of 2009 I attended two meetings in Bonn, one in Bangkok and then COP15 in Copenhagen. I learnt a lot. I got to see political science up front, in real life and at the end I wasn\u2019t very impressed. I whole-heartedly admire the people trying to put up with it, trying with all their might to influence the process and they do, but the results make me sigh and despair.\n\nCOP15 started and ended. The results: it was proclaimed as a failure. It all depends on what kind of perspective you see it. It wasn\u2019t the meeting that brought a treaty that could save the climate and bring us down to a safe level, a failure. But on the other hand, the meeting was also on the verge of collapse, so in that sense it was a success. The process could continue. Objectively though, it was and still is a failure. But political realities doesn\u2019t account for planetary boundaries.\n\nTo be honest, something died within me at the end of COP15. A dream. I had just completed my first semester of Political Science at the end of Copenhagen. I still decided that I would continue to study Political Science to get a bachelor\u2019s degree. But what was I pursuing?\n\nAnd the quest for paid work was just about to begin. Somewhat lost and with a faint sense of direction where I was heading.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-13 09:55:00", "updated_at": "2017-09-01 05:14:42.656702", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1418, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26780, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4660, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Answers and cut off points.</b>\n\nAnswering your questions.

This Edgeryders experimental project aims for truly engaged citizens in real atempts at collaboration between governments and the citizens. Of course, the day after the \\#Lote conference is over, all the problems in Europe won't be fixed. No problem will have been fixed at all, as a matter of fact. But we will have demonstrated that this type of collaboration is possible, it works, and it's fun to do.\n\nIt could take decades to transform the current model of governance into a decent open government model with enough impact to be visible and considerable effect to improve quality of life of citizens. For the moment, opengov stuff is just a vague concept. A nice dream. Almost nobody can feel its effects. The majority of citizens do not even know that this possibility exists, and if they do, I would put my hands in fire that they are not too impressed by its infancy steps.\n\nI won't be satistied until I see some real collaboration, co-creation, and co-governance. I won't be satisfied until the role of governments is modified from production to co-production, until government managers are turned into animators, accompanying citizens and encouraging them to grow and define their own visions of the world, just like the Edgeryders team is doing with this project (it is doing a great job, considering the fact that this has never really been done before).\n\nWhat happens to the After-Edgeryders could have an impact, and inspire the rest of the world to make the effort to build bridges of collaboration with citizens. So far, it has been a very positive learning experience for everyone, and the conversations are amazing, what is being discussed on this platform goes beyond any of our expectations. There is insight coming from all directions, in many areas, beyond the themes.

For further reference on ethics and big data, refer to the <a href=\"https://lote4.hackpad.com/Big-Data-meeting-w-National_DT-BrJJmGg1NLp\">documentation</a> of a previous workshop with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nationale_DT\">Nationale DenkTank</a> (Netherlands).\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" id=\"magicdomid54\" style=\"\">\n\n<span>Tools for Stewarding</span> of Digital Assets</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Self-hosting</strong>.\u00a0Problem: digital data does not contribute to public benefit if it is not open. Good data stewards do not push them onto proprietary platforms, where they get sequestered both technologically (no APIs, or severely limited ones) and legally (no open licenses). \u00a0OpenEthnographer allows better stewardship, because it stores coding (metadata) in the same place as the data are. This allows (encourages, in fact) the stewards of the data to steward the metadata too. Technically, it is easier; ethically, it gives respondents more control, because, by taking away their data, they also destroy the metadata. \u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Self-selection</strong>. Most controversy about privacy in online ethnography disappears once ethnographers decide not to mine Facebook, but instead to use data coming from platforms like Edgeryders, whose social contract explicitly incorporates aggregation and reorganization of users' contributions, and whose users select themselves to participate in the conversation as citizen experts.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Openness</strong>. Making the ethnographic data open means any research conclusion can be challenged on the basis of the same data. It also means inviting other researchers and even the general public to contribute their own research and conclusions.</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2014-10-31 14:32:40", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:21.627438", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 837, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 25.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9644, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3391, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>You'll fit right in :-)</b>\n\nHello Mischa, good to meet you.

The goal was to understand more on how about enforcing the regulations about an access ramp before the shop that can be removed when is not needed. The participants committed nicely by discussing in couples. There was a good collaborative and motivated atmosphere around.</font></font>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8c10613b37fd9cb6090c61b79196c363375386f2.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"487\">\n\n<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font size=\"4\">As facilitators, the openrampette team walked around to help and suggest to the participants how to tackle certain details. A load of pictures was taken around to witness the session. By my side, I was interested in taking pictures as well, even though my perspective was different, more focused on how the session was enacted and how a intersubjective level could emerge from and by the interaction of actors.</font></font>\n\n<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font size=\"4\">Even though the time was up, participants were willing to discuss more on biases on the forms and about the procedure itself. </font></font>\n\n<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font size=\"4\">There was a break with drinks and food for a evening snack. Then, the openrampette team collected the filled forms by the participants and the idea was to find out for patterns and common salients. The paper sheets were layed on the floor and a feedback was given, while @silviad.ambrosio -another openrampette teamer- patched post-its on a frame poster. The most important part followed. Costantino showed some slides about the contradictions and unclear steps in the procedure, like that -for instance- the ramp \u201cbell\u201d to call who is inside the shop, is mentioned only once on the website of the Municipality and is an important part needed to communicate between the customer, that might be someone who needs to access by a wheelchair, or a mother with a baby buggy. </font></font>\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/NeNmf9v3p60\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font size=\"4\">Now, some considerations..</font></font>\n\nFirst of all, a kind of participatory assessment, based on a broad and heterogeneous participation was appreciated also by @alessandro_contini -the designer in charge of the user research meant for shop owners only that will follow this event. What emerged are unexpected cases in-between and common and shared interests among stakeholders. The social dimension emerged as a shared need to construct a substantial and workable objectivity, by a keen and multidimensional analysis of the formal objectivity embedded in the procedure and the script articulated in the fields of the form. What citizens could make visible where aspects of the dimensions for access that usually remain invisible when filling a form or being counseled by a technical adviso<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font size=\"4\">r. </font></font>\n\n<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font size=\"4\">Makers have a peculiar perspective and bird's eye to hack technology and open it. There was great interest around such a technical procedure and bureaucratical details.</font></font>\n\n<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font size=\"4\">A participant even talked about how power be embedded in institutions when it comes to filling forms to satisfy some requirements and how institutions make things difficult. </font></font>\n\n<font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><font size=\"4\">Open care is certainly related to the dimensions of access to practices, but also to information not as end-users, but as editors and reviewers. The evening was a good example of viable and inspired assemblage of citizens, institutions, norms and devices for the public. </font></font>\n\n<a href=\"/t/register-for-openvillage-festival-communities-innovation-healthcare-oct-19-21-brussels/6303\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/ba6281be5dcd475a6b08d26ce01d2bc1920edb70.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"230\">\n\n</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-24 10:09:07", "updated_at": "2017-10-06 16:33:38.473187", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 990, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32746, "user_id": 1633, "topic_id": 2308, "post_number": 23, "raw": "<b>I really like the icons.

However in reality what I would like to do is to set the scene for this conversation so that we have a sensible background for the topic in the days ahead. There are many of you with more experience in this field. I would like to look at these following few issues.\n\n1.Romulus and Remus and the story of expansion and the coercion of labour.\n\nFrom agrarian to the labour society, the coercion of labor, the birth of Rome-, pax plus expansion of Romana, (catholic church, feudal system of royals across Europe), Brittanica, Americana. The limit of dominance and expansion has been reached. We now need to ask ourselves what a non expansional Pax Globalis looks like.\n\nStory of the seeing the sculpture of Romulus and Remus, the Roma flag etc:\n\nCharles Stuart Mill\u2019s definition of slavery, the coercion of labour as the driving force of democratic capitalism, backtrack to Aristotle\u2019s definition of rule. Self interest and the common good. Democracy, rule according to self interest, is founded on the coercion of labour, the alternative is a scenario in which people work from their own initiative, this is self-organizational. I am not implying an either or situation, this is not about one or the other but about both and...Can we create the tools for self-organizational development in europe.\n\nGoal systems monetary reward and creativity, MIT study story. Result: creative intelligence is negated by monetary reward. What is creativity? How does this conflict with the coercion of labour? What are possible solutions to this conflict?\n\n2.Information exchange and the conscious identity, making sense of the transition.\n\nPremise: that the rate at which we exchange information is directly proportionate to the rate of change within our society and our consciousness. This change is influenced and facilitated by technological development, when with the horse, things changed slower than with the wheel\n\nand they have been accelerating ever since. So far there have been two major shifts in information exchange since the development of language.\n\nI'd like to speak about the first and its effects first.\n\nPre printing press in Ireland at least there was collective responsibility and the Brehan laws. 2D art, without depth.\n\nThe invention of the printing press, information distribution, generates a swift change in people's behavior. The renaissance saw the birth of individual self: Printing press, authorship, scientific evolution of journals, Descartes, cogito, 3d point, identity, signing of paintings.\n\n1745 the freedom and equality of man, (empathy grows as people read about the suffering of others) scientific development due to the exchange of scientific journals and the scientific method by which analyses of information and process is proven by individual experience. These processes birth the scientific evolution, the industrial evolution, the technical evolution and the value evolution at roughly 100 year intervals. Along with this centralization of perspective of the individual there is a material analysis and an attachment through personal identity to the fruits of this analysis. In academia there is the division of the houses of learning by specialization. In general there was a consequent centralization of economic process, educational processes. In short, there is wholesale centralization of material and metaphysical processes.\n\nSo what do we mean when we speak about the transition? As far as I can see we are moving away from a centralized individual identity , away from homo-specialis toward the birth of a homo-Globalis.\n\n3.From capitalism to social capital.\n\nIndividual wealth based on selfishness, the I! Me and mine! Are giving way to a collective shared experience of we, us and ours. Through this inner transition we are developing outer mechanisms in this image. Social practice, social enterprise and social business are pulling the heart back into business.\n\nWe are moving away from 'business as usual' into a pleasantly unusual form of business. The infrastructure of the economic world is undergoing a radical shift yet our policies and legal frameworks are not sufficiently wide to accommodate this new scope. In Japan there is a third term to the usual yes no duality, this is called mu. If one answers mu to a proposed\n\nquestion this implies that the limited nature of the question does not permit a true response and so the question must be enlarged. We are living in a mu situation.\n\nFiduciary duty legally binds company executives to act 'in the best interest' of their shareholders. According to economics 101 this is maximum profit in the shortest possible term. As a result we have a host of businesses making ethically impoverished decisions that effectively ruin the lives and cultures of countless people around the world. We educate our economists with hogwash misinterpret ions of Chinese characters equating crisis with opportunity so that these people try to maximize profits in down turning markets. This practice is ludicrous, especially given the true\n\nnature of the character in question wei-ji which in truth means danger and pivotal moment. Imagine a glass on a table\u2019s edge in an impossible balance, in one situation it could return to stability, in the other the glass smashes spilling its contents amidst shards of glass on the floor. We are in this kind of crisis, and those who seek opportunity in what is really a pivotal moment are contributing  to an unconscious creation of cataclysm.\n\nThere is a new understanding of what it means to be a human being.  If you type interest into google the first return you will get will be that of a banking based interpretation. Yet if you look up the etymology of the word you will find something very interesting, inter in latin means 'between',\n\nand esse means 'beings'. Alan Greenspan, when called before the supreme court to play the blame game during America's recession looked as though his life's justifying philosophy had been pulled as a rug from beneath him. When he was asked what happened he replied that for 40 years he had seen the capitalist model work seamlessly by virtue of the 'self interest' of\n\nfinancial institutions being sufficient to regulate the economy. Something had changed and he had no idea of what that could be. He raised the possibility that self interested managers and executives may be to blame for making poor decisions. This seems like a contradiction but it points to a revealing truth. That is, when the self interest of the part acts against the self interest of the whole to which it belongs, the system at fault breaks down. This is selfinterest as holarchy.\n\nWe have entered the anthroposcene, a time characterized by the human presence on earth, and we are at a pivotal moment. We are required to rethink our motivations, and most importantly our identity. In terms of business this will be characterized by the creation of new policies thatcreate favorable conditions for social enterprise, making profit through doing good and reinvesting that profit in doing more good. This model is governed by a new interpretation of the old model of 'self interest' according to its true meaning of a shared existence as one Self inter esse, or one self between beings. In the new paradigm of economics the champions of Social Enterprise will be figures such as Mohamed Yunus and Premal Shah, figures that pave the way and create models that prove the fibre of the times.\n\nGrameen bank didn't take any hit during the recession, Kiva still has the highest repayment rate in the world of finance at 98.7% while it loans out over 2 million per week. These facts coupled with the general rise of social entrepreneurship, social business, open enterprise, and the crowd\n\nsourcing model are all testament to the change in our nature and the nature of the times.\n\n20th century capitalism worked according to the myth of the fit in which Darwin's maxim was taken to mean that the stronger survives. I am still surprised at how few realize that the term fittest as used by Darwin was meant in reference to adaptation and really implies that those who can fit into their environment by virtue of adaptation will survive. Fittest is true in the sense of the fitness of a jigsaw piece to its surroundings. I study project development with the EPA and reading through the literature of the EU it is clear that the European bureaucracy hinged on notions of 'competitiveness'. This kind of thinking will not get us anywhere, except perhaps into a fight. It is time that we live up to all we have learned in our 400 years as analytical individuals and start using the reason we have developed.\n\nTimes change and we have to be prepared to change with them, to resist the change is to resist life.\n\nflipflop.productions(at)gmail.com", "created_at": "2012-07-16 12:38:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.084174", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1491, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24266, "user_id": 2368, "topic_id": 3696, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>I Can Help You</b>\n\nHi people... if you want I'll help you!!! :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-10 16:00:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.568517", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12260, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 2134, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>File storage for groups</b>\n\nThe best way to add files to groups (so far) is creating a piece of content of type \"Document\" in that group, and attaching one or several files to it.

However I'd suggest to not upload large videos this way, as there is no embedded player for them, and it also greatly inflates the storage size of the platform (bad for backups etc.).

Of course you would always have a basic package (and a local package) that would need some serious curating though. If you use plain vanilla file sharing methods such as bluetooth and built in file managers you'd be pretty restricted in terms of elegant updating and file preferences/selection methods, but that is a tradeoff that may be acceptable in certain circumstances.\n\nRe \"central\": I think what you are trying to say is: one highly connected, and one pretty isolated. When I said 5-6 villages, what I had in mind was the 5 you know from rolling dice. Perhaps with one arm extended by one village (making it 6) to see if that changes what is happening along that arm.\n\nRe starting small: One could also consider applying this to the library itself. If we dilute the effective quality of information by (info overload) quantity - that may work against us if we don't have a very effective interface.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-13 20:53:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:50.287073", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 253, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30763], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 842, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 809, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Dopo la presentazione pubblica del progetto open rampette, un\u2019iniziativa pilota per il miglioramento dell\u2019accessibilit\u00e0 degli esercizi commerciali promossa dal Comune di Milano e da WeMake | fablab e makerspace all\u2019interno del progetto <a href=\"http://opencare.cc/\">opencare</a>, gioved\u00ec 11 maggio si \u00e8 tenuto il primo incontro di co-progettazione.\n\nL\u2019incontro ha avuto luogo dalle 18.30 alle circa 21.00 presso <a href=\"http://www.lastecca.org/\">LaStecca3.0</a>, uno spazio innovativo ed accogliente per la socializzazione e la condivisione di diversi progetti legati al quartiere Isola di Milano e non solo.\n\nIncentrato sull\u2019approfondimento dell\u2019esperienza legata all\u2019accessibilit\u00e0 in un esercizio commerciale tramite gli elementi di pulsante \u2013 chiamata \u2013 rampa, il focus della co-progettazione \u00e8 stato condotto ed analizzato sia da parte di chi deve effettuare la chiamata per accedere (tramite campanello) e sia da parte di chi deve ricevere la chiamata e garantire l\u2019accesso al proprio negozio.\n\nClicca <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1--Tksk7IsJIB_9b8T4QQC0iD-giYtwsxhchQ38b328Y/edit?usp=sharing\">qui</a> per accedere e scaricare la presentazione slide e <a href=\"https://flic.kr/s/aHskZtZk5G\">qui</a> per visualizzare la galleria fotografica.\n\nDopo la presentazione ed introduzione al progetto open rampette, i\u00a0partecipanti sono stati divisi nei due gruppi di interesse: il gruppo Dionisio (incentrato sulle riflessioni di chi deve effettuare la chiamata per accedere all\u2019esercizio commerciale) e il gruppo di Minerva (incentrato sulle riflessioni di chi deve ricevere la chiamata e garantire l\u2019accesso al proprio negozio).\n\nEntrambi i gruppi sono stati supportati e facilitati dai membri dello staff di WeMake e dal Comune di Milano, proponendo per ciascun gruppo: 1 moderatore, 1 assistente moderatore, 1 osservatore, 1 maker e 1 rappresentante del Comune di Milano.\n\nI due tavoli di discussione sono stati gestiti in due stanze separate, per poter permettere libera e serena condivisione delle proprie problematiche e riflessioni.

I thought the documentation/harvesting process could benefit from the following ones, before we dive deeper into \"how? who? when?\":\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<h2 class=\"content-section\">What would be useful for me to remember from the time we spend together and learn?</h2>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<h2 class=\"content-section\">What is useful for us as a community to remember from the 3,5 day that we are going to spend together?</h2>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<h2 class=\"content-section\">What do we need to share/feed-back and to whom?</h2>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<h2 class=\"content-section\">What is useful for our longer term learning and what would be useful to share with others / similar networks etc.?</h2>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<h2 class=\"content-section\">How widely could our learnings serve?</h2>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIn this wiki you will find some information (and a little instruction on how the data collection is going to be organised, please read below) about how we're going to capture what's going to happen in Brussels. Harvesting can happen on the level of creating a record or memory (the purpose of this wiki, mostly) - as well as looking for emerging patterns and meaning (will happen on site, primarily).\n\nI'm excited to harvest the crops we've been tending to and will water and nurture in the course of the following weeks!\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Possible Roles</h3>\n\nThe roles are suggestions. Find your own and preferred way to document - and let us participate in each others learnings! If you have an idea for another role - please share. This is just the beginning and I'm eager for (and we are dependent on) your input. :)\n\n<strong>*session journalist</strong>\n\n(got it, he? You document one or several sessions that you attend. Everyone who couldn't come, but is interested in the material, will be a grateful bunny and love you forever.)\n\n<strong>*day journalist, who captures the flow and what happened besides the sessions/talks</strong>\n\n(This event isn't only about what's been talked about during the sessions. So much happens in between, and it would be wonderful to have a couple of people who would like to write a little bit about the flow of the day. Yes, it's cool to go back to the sessions' material after some weeks, but it's also very valuable to read through the flow again and remember the moments in between. Isn't that what un-conferences are about ...?)\n\n<strong>*photographer</strong>\n\n<strong>*video journalist</strong>\n\n<strong>*investigative interviewer of someone who caught your interest during the event</strong>\n\nBios of participants will be made available on site. Pick someone and ask them what you'd like to investigate on further. If you're into trying out something new: Pick someone you're least likely to talk to, normally.\n\n<strong>*seekers for questions, patterns and nuggets </strong>\n\nThe Art of Powerful Questions - very worth reading: <a href=\"http://www.sparc.bc.ca/the-art-of-powerful-questions\">click me!</a>\n\nIf you're in a hurry and just want an idea on the power of good questions: <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3003945/one-conversational-tool-will-make-you-better-absolutely-everything\">just a little something on questions</a> \n\n<strong>*whatever other way you're going to come up with and whatever you feel called to collect </strong>\n\n(I have seen harvesting in form of poems, songs, best dirty jokes from the smokers corners ... whatever you find worth spreading / adding to the information pool / being remembered and carried forth. Remember to have fun and look for what inspires you. If you get bored by what you're documenting, you should probably pick another point to look from. Another question that really calls you. Something that iches and wants to be explored. Find your own point to look from and let us participate in what you see.)\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">How to collect the harvest?</h3>\n\n1.<strong> attend LOTE.</strong> That would help.\n\n<strong>2. takes notes/record things in whatever format that works for you best</strong> (written, pictures, video footage ...)\n\n<strong>3. upload your harvest in whatever form you prefer: <a href=\"/t/about-the-lote5-documentation-category/453\">edgeryders.eu/lote5-doc</a></strong>\n\nThe upside of creating a posting/document and link it:<strong> </strong>The discussion of the sessions can continue in the very thread, add their gold nuggets etc., so the pool of wisdom (ha, how does that sound?!) can potentially grow. If you document one of the sessions, please make sure the session title is also part of the post title.\n\n<strong>4. document with others in realtime: <a href=\"https://lote5.hackpad.com/\">lote5.hackpad.com/</a></strong> (you may need to create an account to see the full list of pads in the lote5 collaction)\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">When is this due?</h3>\n\nIt can be tough for some people (like me) to juggle being fully present at the event and delivering the outcome asap. So don't stress out during LOTE itself. The goal would be to have the material uploaded until approx. 2 weeks after the event.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Please add yourself to the wiki!</h3>\n\nIf you'd like to document a session (woohoooo!!), please add your name next to the session title. In case more session are being added and aren't on the wiki yet, add it! (if the wiki runs out of rows at some point and you don't know how to edit, give @Kaja a shout.)\n\nIf you'd like to document something that is no session, please find a title for it yourself, add it and also write down your name. This is not a binding contract. Play with it and be courageous. Add your shiny selves and dare to share your learnings. Worst case: You fail. Which would be good, especially if you share it, so the rest of us can get a bit of relief from our own fears of fucking things up. You'd do me a favour, at least. And you'd earn the courage crown! :)\n\nThank you for joining the documentation and harvesting team! It would be wonderful if you filled your name in as early as possible, so us documentation and reflection freaks can chill out about this. Thanks! :)\n\n \n\n<a data-mce-href=\"http://forum.el-wlid.com/t573116.html\" href=\"http://forum.el-wlid.com/t573116.html\">\u0639\u0644\u0627\u062c

href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/ashish-ghadiali-birgitta-j-nsd-ttir/system-is-reflection-of-who-we-are-interview-with-birgitta-j-nsd\">interview</a> with Open Democracy, Birgitta J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir of Iceland\u2019s Pirate Party mentions starting \u201c...to talk about [things] at times when it still seems weird.\u201d There is something about weird conversations that tell you that you\u2019re in new territory.\n\nThe first four weeks of my time as an OpenCare Community Fellow has been made up of those kinds of conversations both off and online. Given that this involves curating a theme in response to a challenge as huge as welfare system failure across Europe perhaps this was to be expected. It\u2019s a complex issue that demands new insights, new perspectives and where better to draw these from than the web of connections between grassroots engaged activity that is often taking place persistently and having to learn and adapt unendingly - just to sustain itself.\n\nMy early encounters with the Edgreryders platform, I\u2019ll be honest, have been confusing. That said there is something in this that reflects the incredible diversity of the members and their contributions. Engaging with this complexity requires a new set of skills and senses. Absorb, stumble, unravel, gather. It is at times frustrating - it\u2019s at odds with standard linear project trajectories and ways of working. So perhaps I\u2019m simply experiencing the necessary pain we all encounter as we grow the inner muscles and capacities to cope with the complexity at the edge of wicked problems. It also feels necessarily a slow process of absorption before I can begin to synthesise and produce.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s unsettling and creates some vulnerability. But in being open to the confusion and discomfort - I\u00a0sense I\u2019m creating space for something new. This is my learning. I\u2019m open to being challenged by as well as offering challenges to all I\u2019m encountering - I guess this is a process of\u00a0peer validation.\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a9976271d9da5824728bf87f1bfe19a6afd3a40f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"458\">\n\n\u00a0\n\nConversations over the first month have helped to refine the theme from how I\u2019d <a href=\"/t/theme-session-proposal-architectures-of-love-policy-vs-culture-in-creating-the-conditions-for-opencare/6271\">originally</a> outlined it. This <a href=\"/t/theme-architectures-of-love/6360\">now</a> focuses in more on insights from citizen-led responses to illuminate the <strong>enabling factors</strong>\u00a0that support our natural impulses as human beings to take care of ourselves and one another. These insights will shape how we understand the kind of conditions that grow and sustain grassroots\u00a0care initiatives. They will help to define the \u2018microclimates\u2019 that animate or inhibit this kind of self organised activity. My intention is that this will start to inform how we understand the role of policy in the\u00a0more disbursed ecology of care called for in response to\u00a0growing health needs.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Enabling factors</strong>\n\nConversations started to pinpoint some of these\u00a0<em>enabling factors</em>:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Enspiral\u2019s <a href=\"https://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/stewarding.html\">stewarding circle</a>;</li>\n\n<li>Network reciprocity, mutuality, shared values;</li>\n\n<li>Mental and spiritual well being such as that fostered by @Bernard \"<em>Creating situations for healthy experiences that facilitate collaborations\u201d;</em>\n</li>\n\n<li>Experiences that create sense of self - being in relationship with others and the world - so beautifully captured in this quote from Abiba Birhane; \u201c<em>being happens in the space between the self and the world</em>\u201d in a <a href=\"https://aeon.co/ideas/descartes-was-wrong-a-person-is-a-person-through-other-persons\">link</a> shared by\u00a0@markomanka;</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSimon (@asimong) suggested a useful categorisation for <em>enabling factors\u00a0</em>that I\u2019ve amended slightly using\u00a0insights from others:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>The skills, awarenesses, competences, knowledge and practices of individuals;</li>\n\n<li>The designed environment, including public spaces and communal spaces;</li>\n\n<li>Values and a culture of care;</li>\n\n<li>The designed opportunities for interaction, engagement, collaboration;</li>\n\n<li>Commons of all kinds, material sufficiency.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nComing across @Alex_Levene's\u00a0immense proposal <a href=\"/t/helping-refugees-an-openvillage-strand/6249\">Helping Refugees</a> - the first category connects to one of the discussion points he outlines \u201cPractices for developing cohesion and integration.\u201d It strikes me that the notion of <em>practices</em> seems more useful than\u00a0\u2018good practice\u2019, which appears\u00a0prescriptive by comparison. Perhaps the idea that <em>p</em><em>ractices</em>\u00a0create the conditions for collective action, while <em>good practice</em> is an instrument of policy would be worth further discussion.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSimon makes another interesting point - that these kind of skills are \u201c<a href=\"/t/theme-session-proposal-architectures-of-love-policy-vs-culture-in-creating-the-conditions-for-opencare/6271/14\">not</a> learned, [rather] picked up from living in a culture where they are norms, through a process you could call \u2018enculturation\u2019.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe fourth category\u00a0connects with what <a href=\"http://dark-mountain.net/mountaineers/dougie-strang/\">Dougie Strang</a> of Dark Mountain referred to during our chat as \u2018deep encounters\u2019 and this is something that I'm keen to\u00a0explore further. How do we facilitate these kind of experiences?\u00a0Might this be one mode of Simon's 'enculturation'?\u00a0\u00a0(This might be worth a separate blog post...)\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Roles &amp; responsibilities</strong>\n\nAll interesting insights on which to build. Another\u00a0area that is opening up through these conversations starts to re-evaluate\u00a0the relationship between citizens and the State. State care responses are dependent on and delivered by institutions designed and built in a different era and on a different world view. Consideration of citizen-led care responses will take us into a process of renegotiating the roles and responsibilities of the citizen and the state.\u00a0\n\nA number of threads of\u00a0conversation\u00a0touched on this issue of responsibility. @Alberto\u00a0referenced the Amish refusal of health insurance on the grounds that it \u2018de-responsibilises\u2019 people. Conversation with <a href=\"http://wendyball.org/\">Wendy Ball</a> explored her recent intervention in a street fight and how \u2018externalising responsibility\u2019 for care creates dependency on state responses -\u00a0turning us into passive subjects. This lack of agency can become crippling and is a symptom of how 'de-responsibilised' we've become.\n\n<strong>Early considerations on role of policy</strong>\n\nWhere policy sits in relation to this also came up in conversation. Simon commented that \u201cmisguided policy can be worse than no policy\u201d\u00a0and we agreed that this wasn\u2019t to dismiss the efforts of policymakers altogether. Policy is by its nature \u2018top-down\u2019 and in conversation with @Luke_Devlin we couldn\u2019t <em>not</em> notice the etymological connection between the words <em>Policy/Police/Politic</em> - <em>polites</em> is citizen, <em>polis</em> is city or state (as well as Glasweigan for police!). But the word policy itself means \u201cway of management\u201d and the discussion is perhaps - what ways of managing the health and social care of citizens are most appropriate given what we now know about how the world works has shifted considerably since the times of ancient Greece or 14th C France. The current mechanics of government need reform if they are to cope with the scale and complexity of current challenges.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOver the coming months and through the Open Village program, more of these conversations and questions will refine an understanding of the enabling factors for OpenCare - drawing largely on the multitude of posts by the Edgeryders community that detail\u00a0real life experience and precious lessons learned about what works and what doesn't work.\u00a0In the process clues will be gathered that start to\u00a0deconstruct policy and re-imagine new tools that are more generative in relation to the health and wellbeing of citizens. And beyond this perhaps how we reconfigure the role of the State to re-calibrate responsibility and the role of citizens in ways that create greater agency as a foundation to health.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-01 18:12:01", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 14:13:44.061053", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1438, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 218.6, "like_count": 7, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [200, 3605, 3433, 3, 3362, 3704, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31476, "user_id": 1842, "topic_id": 2421, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>Newsletters as a conversations' catalys</b>\n\n<div class=\"gmail_default\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: small; line-height: normal; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', sans-serif;\">Another thought\n\n- can the newsletter be an excuse and catalyst for focused practitioner discussions amongst this group?</div>\n\n<div class=\"gmail_default\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: small; line-height: normal; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', sans-serif;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div class=\"gmail_default\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: small; line-height: normal; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', sans-serif;\">The Edgeryders forum will definitely atrophy without some solid reason to return.</div>\n\n<div class=\"gmail_default\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: small; line-height: normal; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', sans-serif;\">\u200b\u200b</div>\n\n<div class=\"gmail_default\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: small; line-height: normal; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', sans-serif;\">It would also be great to have an excuse to Hangout occasionally.</div>\n\n<div class=\"gmail_default\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: small; line-height: normal; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', sans-serif;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div class=\"gmail_default\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: small; line-height: normal; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', sans-serif;\">And a discussion will aid the content curation process.</div>\n\n<div class=\"gmail_default\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: small; line-height: normal; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', sans-serif;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div class=\"gmail_default\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: small; line-height: normal; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', sans-serif;\">Anybody else interested?</div>\n\n<div class=\"gmail_default\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: small; line-height: normal; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', sans-serif;\">Get started with a 'cocreative leadership' Hangout sometime in the next couple of weeks?</div>", "created_at": "2014-03-31 05:06:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.068013", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 298, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31471], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 841, "user_id": 3649, "topic_id": 808, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2>WHAT?</h2>\n\nA social enterprise beer brewing club.\n\n<h2>WHY?</h2>\n\nSt. James\u2019 Hospital,\u00a0Dublin,\u00a0commissioned a service design project\u00a0in search of\u00a0\u00a0a non-clinical, community based service design solution to the problem of particularly poor overall personal health locally. The aim is to focus on reducing\u00a0the number of inpatients over fifty years of age with entering the hospital with preventable ailments such as heart disease, high cholesterol, dementia, and lung cancer.\u00a0\n\nThe hospital is based\u00a0in The Liberties in Dublin, which got its name in the 12th century due to its location just outside Dublin City's walls \u2013 lands united with the city, but still keeping their own jurisdiction (hence \"liberties\"). The area's history is still very relevant to the health of its residents.\n\nBeing outside the city walls, the Liberties became a hub for trade and craftsmen. The 19th century saw the Liberties become dominated by large brewing and distilling families, most notably Guinness who built the world's largest brewery there. With this industrial wealth, however, came dire poverty and slum living conditions. Today the Liberties\u00a0is a city neighbourhood of opportunities and innovation, but its history -\u00a0positive and negative -\u00a0pervades. Although having undergone much urban regeneration as well as gentrification,\u00a0the Liberties still embodies that juncture between being a centre for enterprise and commercial life as well as being home to large blocks of inner city social housing. Homelessness, drug use, and lower than average life expectancy are some of the problems facing\u00a0in the Liberties today.\u00a0\n\nOn researching in the area first-hand, it was observed that there was a distinct lack of male presence in local community centres, as well as a high number of men drinking alone in pubs. The Liberties Local Health project draws on this observation to engage those lone drinkers to become members of a local brewing club, where beer is brewed by locals, for locals.\n\nThe\u00a0project takes its inspiration from the highly successful Men\u2019s Sheds mental health initiative whose\u00a0motto is, \u201cmen don\u2019t talk face to face, they talk shoulder to shoulder.\u201d\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">HOW?</h2>\n\nThe\u00a0brewing club for men over fifty\u00a0in the locality \u2013 where they create a low percentage beer brewed by locals,\u00a0for locals \u2013\u00a0harnesses existing local\u00a0skill sets of the hundreds of Guinness factory retirees.\n\nThe brewing club, \"Sl\u00e1inte\", takes it name from the Irish word for \"cheers\", also meaning \"health\". The aim of the club is to\u00a0encourage\u00a0more responsible drinking through\u00a0appreciation of the brewing process\u00a0as well as forming a sense of pride and comradery among members. The project was commended by health industry professionals after its presentation at Dublin\u2019s Active Age Conference 2012.\n\nWith Ireland's craft beer market having hit\u00a0\u20ac59 million in 2016 (up form \u20ac40 million in 2015) and volumes of beer from Irish microbreweries having increased by 415% between 2011 and 2015, the brewing club \"Sl\u00e1inte\" has high viability potential to run itself as a social enterprise overseen by members, bringing with it a sense of pride, achievement, and overall better health.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">USER JOURNEY</h2>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dd361a63824dc6e19fe7d83dc61f46d515f79c50.jpg\" width=\"359\" height=\"359\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9b74a859e676a3e65e6e7afa003b2a6b44ff054f.png\" width=\"326\" height=\"500\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/94f2187eedd5d9a35e15813d26a8ec5c45166096.jpg\" width=\"359\" height=\"359\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ece33b3009554b15663978f6e3cc49df1b609f96.jpg\" width=\"359\" height=\"359\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/329625617090118f77695ae38b28b669755dae36.jpg\" width=\"359\" height=\"359\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dd18f4dd2a0e694571e4450578dd303694181075.jpg\" width=\"359\" height=\"359\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f45f64516c04c5332ccb37de51c76cf2f341cbe9.jpg\" width=\"359\" height=\"359\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/663d2845f71ead42f85d647d11f962cac9955f32.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8a1d10494efc3fc1b05fe1adf5fe56369adc7171.jpg\" width=\"516\" height=\"346\">\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-16 11:40:16", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 04:35:16.144069", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 849, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10494, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 796, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>How do you deal with market failures?</b>\n\nFun thing:\u00a0only at the end of the article did I understand that FairBnb is about accommodation! :-)\n\nNice to meet you @Damiano , thanks for contributing on what is definitely a hot topic.

Available, affordable health and social care was \u2013 and still is \u2013 unavailable. Not for some unknown person in some distant land, either. For friends and family members, people in our communities, right here. Something had to be done.\n\n<strong>We saw people coming together, stepping into the breach</strong>. Communities were taking up the role of care providers, making it work where neither the state nor private business could. They were doing amazing things. Hackers were making open sourced, internet-enabled glucose monitors for children with diabetes. Belgian trauma therapists set up mobile studios and drove them to refugee camps in Greece, to help bereaved refugees. Bipolar 1 patients found and helped each other fight back suicidal tendencies. Biologists and biohackers were trying to invent a cheap, open source process to make insulin. American activists were encouraging each other to eat healthy food and exercise by doing it together.\n\nWe started a research projects to take a good look inside <a href=\"/en/op3ncare/helping-one-another-to-discover-what-is\">these and many other stories</a>. We wanted to learn what these initiatives have in common, and how we could make more. That project is called OpenCare; it is now in its second year. <a href=\"/t/opencare-what-happened-in-year-1/6073\">Results are still coming through</a>, but one thing is already clear:\n\n<blockquote data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"bav2s\" data-offset-key=\"du3c1-0-0\"><strong><em>It's all about humans.</em></strong></blockquote>\n\nCommunity provision of care services needs humans: \u00a0more, better prepared, volunteers. People prepared to teach each other skills. \u00a0Therapists to help volunteers in need of trauma support. So, the highest-impact technologies are those that help bring people together. Share knowledge. Distribute human resources across different care contexts. These technologies are connectors: they help string together and coordinate human efforts.\n\nThis intuition is fundamental. It goes even beyond care. And it makes sense: we are, after all, the 99%. We have little money and power. <strong>We have no large companies, fancy foundations, prestigious universities. But we do have each other.</strong> We will thrive, if we can collaborate. But there's a problem: collaboration is expensive, and hard to monetise. So, any technology that makes it more efficient is going to make a difference.\n\nAt Edgeryders, we have resolved to put this lesson into practice. <strong>We are doing it by hacking the most fundamental connecting technology of all: the home.</strong>\n\n<strong>We dream of a new kind of space</strong>, that can be the hearth for our families but still be open to the broader world. Where the door is not a barrier to keep the world out, but a gateway to a global network. Where we can live, and work, and sometimes work with the people we live with, and live with our co-workers. Where people are welcome to stay for one day, or a lifetime. Where spending even just an hour in good heart ensures you will never be a stranger again. Where we can develop our talent, learn new skills, get better at what we do. Where we can create for each other a healthy, friendly, cosmopolitan environment and, yes, take care of each other.\n\n<strong>We have dreamt this dream before. In its previous iteration, we called it the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315\">unMonastery</a></strong>. We prototyped in 2014, in the Italian city of Matera. That experience taught us much. We learned that\u00a0a life/work space can not be too close to the needs of a single client. Neither can it be dependent on the grant cycle. It needs to be financially self-sustaining, and benefit several projects and lines of business. We also learned\u00a0how important it is to be diverse, open and outward-looking for fresh air and fresh ideas to circulate at all times.\n\nThe unMonastery also got many things right. The most important one is this: <em><strong>we went ahead and tried it</strong></em>. Planning and due diligence are necessary, but trying things out makes for richer learning.\n\nSo, we are not going to keep dreaming about a new space. Instead, we have decided to roll out\u00a0a second iteration. Right now.\n\n<strong>We are calling it The Reef</strong>. Coral reefs are structures built by tiny animals, corals. They serve as the home, anchoring point, hiding place, hunting ground to thousands of species. Algae, seaweeds, fish, molluscs all cooperate with, compete with, eat, feed each other. As they do so, they benefit the corals, who gain access to nutrients (reefs exist in nutrient-poor tropical waters).\n\n<strong>Like coral reefs, our new space will draw strength from diversity and symbiosis</strong>. Different people will bring in different skills, access to different networks, different personalities. And Edgeryders itself (a social enterprise, so a creature of a different species) will live in symbiosis with the space and the individuals that live in it. It will pay rent, subsidising those who live there; in return, it will be able to use the space for its own purposes: office, coworking space, venue for small events. We also want to offer some form of access to a broad network of people right from the start.\n\nWe ran the numbers and we are sure we can make it work. <strong>We are going to start with a small-scale prototype: a Brussels loft, with four bedrooms, common living area, office, courtyard</strong>. @Noemi , @Nadia and I are going to be full-time residents; one more room will host temporary residents. We are going live on May 1st 2017, and try it out for one year. We are already looking for a (much) larger space to move into in spring 2018 if the experiment goes well.\n\nIf you are considering being part of the experiment, or curious about learning more, get in touch. We are planning a \"building the Reef\" track within to OpenVillage where we, together, will design the physical space, its financing model, and the activites therein \u2013 from business to fitness and personal development.\n\n[PRACTICAL INFO GO HERE]\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-26 19:01:35", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 14:42:03.971424", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1075, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 90.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3433, 8, 4448], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7105, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2969, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Beware the smart city</b>\n\nAh, <a href=\"/u/elf_pavlik\">@elf Pavlik</a>, that of smart city is quite a dangerous concept.

In my life's experience, in a country where class divide is strong, subtle and ever present, \u00absemi-markets\u00bb as well as institutional controlled provisions,\u00a0 were always, at the end of the day, exclusive and unfair, only those \u00abwell functioning markets\u00bb were equitable.

There is something comfortable about markets to me: they don't reward your social origins or your family names.\n\nBut there are also good ethical news about markets this days.

So, if you want to have innovation rents, you will have to create continuously new innovations, because they are more and more temporary.

We have a self organized structure for those who need to develop strategies and make future plans (policies, surveys, polls, legal studies, campaigns, mapping, communication, etc), while the rest can easily explore and express their creativity in many different ways (art, tv-radio, documentaries, including crushed cans noise and -of course- drums).\n\n<em>...you know- what happens after we make the political change we want to see happen?

But he does have an open mind, and observes what goes on around him with a keen eye.\n\nWow, I am impressed by your vision of medecine, I agree with you, focusing on an organ, isolating one part of the body, is indeed 'a futile exercise'. I wish that governments would understand this. We could dramatically cut on health spending! And people would be more happy (ie less use of anti-depressants). Actually, I know that there are officials from the pandemic preparedness sphere that are beginning to see the applications of consciousness in the public health area.\n\nYou talk about the \"flaws of the western health system, truths about time and perception, the many aspects of our being and how they interrelate and interweave\". I am also deeply interested in these things. I know that there is a power within us, that allows to self-heal. This power can be developed through bliss, or extasy, joy and love. By reaching this state, all cells of the body heal. As you said, everything is interrelated and interweaved. (This video changed my life and helped me to understand the role of the 'happy hormones': http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfBWtovxYQY)\n\nWhen I started participating at Edgeryders, I was drifting. I had a (vague) idea about the nature of the Universe. I met other participants, and they helped me think and refine my thoughts and vision. I developed a great friendship with a philosopher (Michel Filippi) and it is a fullfilling fantastic experience. Last Fall, I felt isolated, I was looking for other people like me. Thanks to the Edgeders project, I recently discovered a community that fits my needs (the Institute of Consciousness Research). Recently, I met people in Los Angeles, and I am in the process of helping this group build communities and look at ways to develop worldwide collaboration. All this happened via my participation with Edgeryders. So, I encourage you to keep following your intuition. It always tels us the right thing to do (although sometimes we think it might be inappropriate and crazy). Keep listening!\n\nAlso, using social media to connect to others that share similar interests, being active members of online communities, will keep you growing and learning.

Radical monopoly imposes compulsory consumption and thereby restricts personal autonomy. It constitutes a special kind of social control because it is enforced by means of the imposed consumption of a standard product that only large institutions can provide.\n\nThe control of undertakers over burial shows how radical monopoly functions and how it differs from other forms of culturally defined behavior. A generation ago, in Mexico, only the Opening of the grave and the blessing of the dead body were performed by professionals: the gravedigger and the priest. A death in the family created various demands, all of which could be taken care of within the family. The wake, the funeral, and the dinner served to compose quarrels, to vent grief, and to remind each participant of the fatality of death and the value of life. Most of these were of a ritual nature and carefully prescribed-different from region to region. Recently, funeral homes were established in the major cities. At first undertakers had difficulty finding clients because even in large cities people still knew how to bury their dead. During the sixties the funeral homes obtained control over new cemeteries and began offering package deals, including the casket, church service, and embalming. Now legislation is being passed to make the mortician's ministrations compulsory. Once he gets hold of the body, the funeral director will have established a radical monopoly over burial, as medicine is at the point of establishing one over dying.\"\n\nIn today's community call, I made the suggestion that one approach to LOTE tracks, might be to write out short briefs for component\u00a0elements that you'd like to see built upon during the weekend, this suits best the unMonastery track. The idea being;\u00a0I can think of a ton of things that the unMonastery needs but no one is taking the lead on - within EdgeRyders there are many skilled facilitators that would likely be happy to facilitate an open ended discussion on these subjects, without having to give structure.\u00a0\n\nAt LOTE1 Smari, scheduled a session called \"can the internet build big things\", a lot of people turned up, Smari didn't have anything other than the title to structure the session - but it turned into one of most fruitful sessions I attended at the conference. In the race to organisation LOTE3, we shouldn't over administrate,\u00a0well placed concepts with collective momentum will be built in the moment, not prepped months in advance.\n\nPerhaps 'Life and Death in the unMonastery' will be one of those kernals for discussion.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-13 11:35:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:45.806839", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 516, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29941, "user_id": 2412, "topic_id": 3895, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>Outstanding!</b>\n\nNadia -- Thank you very much.

In a way this is good news: Congress is a great event, and it deserves its success. At the same time, though, we were a little sad.\u00a0We had been looking forward to getting together at Congress. We have run Edgeryders assemblies at 31C3 and 32C3, and were hoping to make this into a <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-at-32c3-was-31c3/424\">small tradition</a>.\u00a0\n\nTurns out others, like us, had been unable to get tickets. Talking to some of them, we had an idea: rent our own venue in Hamburg and run a satellite event. Community magic kicked in, and it is beautiful to behold. Generous people chipped in with manpower,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.alt33c3.org/\">website development</a>, and the ever-precious coordination skills. Orga likes the idea, and donated the logo.\u00a0We secured a great venue: the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.radissonblu.com/en/hotel-hamburg\">Radisson Blu</a>, in the same complex as the Congress Center Hamburg. We'll be literally looking out our window at the iconic\u00a0<a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/8320513137_f836c91226_c.jpg\">rocket</a>.\u00a0\n\nAs \u00a0of a few hours ago, a crowdfunding launched. The idea is to have a kind of \"modular\" event, by renting more meeting rooms in the Radisson as more people join. The first one accommodates 22 people; as I write this we are already close to covering its costs. We can then continue to accept more people up to about 500.\u00a0\n\nIf you are reading this, whoever you are, you are an edgeryder. If you know Congress, you already love it. If you don't know it, take our word for it \u2013 you soon will. So join us for alt33c3, 27-30 December 2016.

larger conversation around the \"<a href=\"/t/living-communism-spreading-anarchy-call-for-submissions-for-openvillage-festival/6445\">Living Communism, spreading anarchy</a>\" theme is a recognition of our dependence on institutions. \u00a0I think holistic medicines and yoga and meditation are amazing tools that we must grow and learn from. \u00a0But as we always say, if I break my arm, I'm not looking to reiki. \u00a0And especially through my job as an ER doc, Im trained and beholden (monetarily and functionally) to these institutions. \u00a0In this transition period, I do think we need to recognize the role of these institutions and utilize them. \u00a0But I would disagree with the end of your thoughts. \u00a0One thing I have seen through my experiences in medicine is that these institutions are not neutral entities. \u00a0For example, in the cases you described above, the modern ICU care here in the US is utterly life-saving. \u00a0But the costs of that care is entirely externalized. \u00a0From an environmental standpoint, the amount of waste to sterlize things, create medications, and treat is fundamentally based upon a destructive model. \u00a0In addition, the economic supply chains dictate that the costs of production and destruction are\u00a0borne by poorer countries and individuals (toxic waste dumps, environmental racism, people needing to clean, people stuck in dead end jobs creating sterilized instruments). \u00a0Lastly, the hospitals themselves are now these \"non-profit\" corporations, where the medical community is fully attached and perpetuates the upper middle class/elite class lifestyle (i.e. in the \"watershed\" moments mentioned above, the doctor used to be a member of the community. \u00a0Now the doctor is a country club member), and so the motivations for the hospital is revenue. \u00a0I bring these up not to critique the use of these institutions. \u00a0But as we're seeing in <a href=\"https://itsgoingdown.org/hamburg-vs-state-city-fighting-back-police-losing/\">Hamburg</a> now, inevitably to live the \"communism\" we want, we will have to partake in the destruction of these systems. \u00a0I think that is a lesson we can take from the \"back to land\" movements of the 70's here in the US. \u00a0It is not enough to have the positivity of communal life or autonomy. \u00a0There must be the negativity, the destruction of these systems that want to destroy us (if in doubt, think about the fact that dioxin, which is the most toxic substance created, which is produced from the destruction of plastic, and then think about how much plastic is thrown out in hospitals, and then think that that substance is not found in almost all breast milk, it touches on the idea that modern industrial capitalism wants to destroy us). \u00a0Some would argue that this is dark, but the world is dark. \u00a0We must acknowledge that. \u00a0What I think our mission and the ideas we would like to highlight, is how can we create projects that are motivated by creation, but utilize the destruction. \u00a0I think a more strategic aim is to think of how to manipulate these institutions. \u00a0How can we make it those that the ICU serves the commons, not us serving the ICU. \u00a0\n\nLooking forward to the thoughts and conversations!\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-08

Here are a few other things:\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe local community currency I know and have experience of using and trying to promote is the Stroud Pound (http://www.stroudpound.org.uk/) - and you can watch these films about it: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8579476.stm and by reuteurs: http://www.reuters.com/video/2010/03/31/uk-town-prints-its-own-money?videoId=65735534&amp;videoChannel=5\n\nAs hinted in the film, the main issue has been getting businesses to take it on. Chicken and egg situation where each business will only take it on if others do. We're looking into whether a pledgebank scheme where each business only has to start using stroudpounds if 49 others start doing so at the same time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne argument we come up against in stroud - which is a place with a relatively high proportion of independent, local traders, is that people feel they already show commitment to these shops just by spending sterling there. They struggle to get that spending stroud pounds means the money stays local, whereas spending sterling means it is much more likely to leak out of the local economy at some point.\n\nThe films are good on the reasons traders are averse - but it should be pointed out that no trader needs to buy or sell stroud pounds if they receive them in payment or pay them out for services. We're working with the Council to see if business rates (taxes) could be part paid in Stroud Pounds, so that all local businesses would have at least one way to spend them. Similarly, we're trying to get the local green electricity supplier to take them, which again would enable almost all local businesses to be able to spend Stroud pounds rather than have to cash them in and lose 3%. The \u00a360 joining fee is an issue, but businesses get a lot of advertising for that, so it's silly really to complain about it. I guess it's worth saying that one difficulty in setting up such schemes is you may find individuals who are just hard to work with and won't help you out no matter how hard you try to make things easy for them!\n\nWith regards to the timebank in Stroud - FairShares works pretty well among the people who use it I think, but that's not a high proportion of the populace. I know the guy who runs it but apart from fixing some people's bikes for free have not used it much myself. I donated the credits I earned to the 'community pot', so that people who spend but can't earn as much (older people, or whoever) can call on the community pot to 'pay' for time of volunteers to help them. Good innovation to encourage both circulation AND community spirit rather than acquisitiveness!\n\n\u00a0\n\nHope that helps, please get in touch by email if you'd like to talk more about these projects. Finally, you may be interested in the section on money and banking in \"The anarchist collectives: workers' self-management in the Spanish Revolution 1936-1939 - Sam Dolgoff\", available here: http://libcom.org/library/anarchist-collectives-workers-self-management-spanish-revolution-1936-1939-sam-dolgoff . I find this fascinating - they sought to avoid money and use gift economy (just producing and letting anyone in need take) and barter exchange wherever possible, but reverted to community currencies where necessary. They even set up banks which acted as accounting houses for barter exchanges. Really interesting - and going back to an early point - IT IS OK TO HATE MONEY. We should continue to seek to challenge and reverse commodisation and money-value, and turn instead towards production for need and gift economies wherever possible I think. And I don't think that will affect your ability to earn money in a psychologically strange way - even if it did, I would argue that taking the belief to heart and acting on it is more important than making money - in the west, we are lucky enough to pretty much always be able to figure out a way to survive (assuming we are young and able bodied, which I am assuming you are...!)\n\nAnyway, all for now.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-18 14:14:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.672581", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 748, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3788, "user_id": 1974, "topic_id": 3755, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>\"Grass-root activism is recognised as a positive force for change all over the world.

They showed preferences to horizontal cooperation, innovative approaches, localized initiatives, collective action and informal economy. These results allowed us to formulate future policy recommendations for the UNDP and other institutional development players in Armenia, Georgia and Egypt; perhaps more importantly, they prompted new awareness of what activists can do themselves to develop collaborations with each other.\" - </em>this is the draft accepted to conference in Brussels.\n\nDeadline of submitting a paper is November 3, 2014, so I say - let's start writing.

Understanding how language works, how to think critically, and how to convey thoughts effectively were (and are) essential for a scholar, and also I should think for a generally cultivated person. I will give the disclaimer that I'm no specialist in the history of education, but I have yet to hear anything from medievalists to the contrary of this way of thinking.\n\nI take your point about specialists and generalists. Perhaps da Vinci was not the best example I could have given for what I was trying to get across. I think what I was trying to say was that we are running the risk of putting too much emphasis on specialization rather than encouraging people to have a broad spectrum of skills and interests that can have the potential to be put to use rather than simply being relegated to 'hobby' status.\n\nAnother example I use in my aforementioned article (which, thinking on it, may have been a better illustration of my argument from the start), was a personal one. In my time as a curator, I regularly interacted with brilliant and enthusiastic amateurs and hobbyists. Some of these were old gents who, despite being employed in various other trades and occupations, had developed over years and decades a knowledge of the types of objects I cared for that left me (the 'expert') in awe. But, unlike them, I happen to have an MA degree, hence I could become a curator and they could not. I see that as not only unjust but, frankly, a huge potential loss of talent.\n\nSo, I guess my concern is that we're in danger of being so reliant on formal credentials as an indicator of competence, that we potentially overlook those who have extraordinary skills but no bits of paper to 'prove' them. Competence over credentials.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-09-14 15:19:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.428848", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 349, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13585], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5637, "user_id": 2394, "topic_id": 5604, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The OpenCare project is about how communities provide care, and how that role will change in the future. It's not about incremental improvements to the existing state-controlled, centralised care infrastructure. It is about autonomous groups developing their own systems of care, using approaches that are sensitive of\u00a0local contexts and\u00a0cultural norms - a \"<a href=\"/t/welcome-to-opencare/4858\">deeply human approach</a>\", as Nadia puts it.\u00a0\n\nI'm doing a PhD looking at communities on Twitter -\u00a0mostly communties around towns or cities -\u00a0but in this case I'm going to be looking at various interconnected communties building innovotive,\u00a0open and\u00a0decentralised systems of care. My approach is to start with Twtiter users who I know are core members of a communty, and then\u00a0'spider' out from them - who they talk\u00a0to, who talks to the people they talk to, and so on.\u00a0\n\nI've started with communities that I've found about open source health tech and\u00a0development health issues, in part using data from\u00a0<a href=\"https://opensource.com/health\">here</a>. \u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/42a40a790712ffe46ac87cd4321e4978e8560d91.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n\nThe diagram shows Twitter users,\u00a0hashtags and the links between them . Twitter users are considered linked if one mentions another, a Twitter user is linked to a hashtag when they use the hashtag. Thickness of the line indicates the number of links, and the colours indicate automatically identified 'communities'.\n\nThe complete network consists of around 60,000 nodes, however, here I've shown only those which are connected at least 4 times.\u00a0\n\nThe purple\u00a0network is focused on open source prosthetics, with openBionics at its centre. OpenBionics are making open source prosthetic hands.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOrange and Yellow are more focused on international\u00a0and development health issues. Blue shows lots of makerspaces, with WeMake, who are partners on OpenCare, at the center. \u00a0This occured organically.\u00a0\n\nOpen health software is green, which, perhaps surprisingly, is closely assoicated with the UK's National Health Service, through the\u00a0openMAXIMS software. This connection may not be as important to the overall community as the diagram suggests, as more data accrues it may fade into the background.\n\nAt this stage, the Edgeryders and OpenCare participants haven't been added into the network. That data is currently being gatehred, and it will be interesting to see how the project fits into the overall ecosystem.\u00a0\n\nOver time, I hope the OpenCare project will be able to use this data to invite people to workshops, discover missing links, and deepen the connections between the different communities. It may even be possible to observe increased interaction between the different communities in diagrams such as the one presented here.\u00a0\n\nThis data is provided in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wrZwtKXz2xdDabRLmPIawjxPWeS1jP0ksCt5xA6z0RM/edit?usp=sharing\">spreadsheet form here</a>, sorted into categories.

It is a community and not-for-profit organisation working to support creative and innovative individuals who often find themselves at odds with current socio-economic problems or abusive political establishments. Most community members are not wealthy, or live precariously, but have a record of running projects that make a positive contribution to the wellbeing of communities in all corners of Europe.\n\nDuring October 29 - November 3 the network convenes for its third offline event - Living On The Edge (LOTE), and chose the city of Matera as location. Why? Because Matera is becoming a warm home to the world\u2019s first unMonastery. If you know about this project being prototyped, you probably also know that Edgeryders is where it was born and got its first acclaims.\n\nFor those of us willing to take risks to try out innovative solutions, they cost a lot in personal commitment and security. So having been given a context in Matera where we can do a service to the community with passion, and have our meals covered makes us immensely grateful. Aside from taking pride in it, Edgeryders believe in and want to learn how to create other unMonasteries in Europe. A good relationship has been built with the municipality and local social innovators; we would like to cultivate it and benefit from the expertise of the people in Matera. We also want to introduce ourselves to Materans properly and in full capacity, at Lote.\n\nIf you are up for building a long standing relationship with people at the Edge, come to Lote! It\u2019s a five day event built entirely by the community as we write this. It costs you nothing, but there are plenty of ways you can get the most out of meeting Edgeryders:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tRegister for the event.

Actually in Transylvania there are coexisting rural settlements with more than 50% of the carnivore animals in Europe, and many unique bird and flower species. \n\n</span>\n\n<span>There are many places in which Agriculture is realized with NATURAL FERTILIZER (manure, that helps preserving flower species, butterflies\u2026) and where chattels graze freely during the day.\n\n</span>\n\n<b><span>\u00a0</span></b>\n\n<b><span>The GOOD NEWS \n\n</span></b>\n\n<span>Is that many young Romanians are GOING FORWARD, BY RETURNING to their parental villages and running AGRO-TURISTIC activities, in many cases WITH THE SUPPORT OF EU\u2019s FOUNDS. This is making possible to insure a living, to reduce unemployment, to increase salaries in URBAN environment (by reducing available workforce), increasing the mobility between regions (because of tourism, translations from one region seeking better jobs). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese is a great opportunity because is a matter of making people realize that what they were doing since generation IS TODAY APPRETIATED AND HAS FANCY NAME LIKE \u201cBIO\u201d, \u201cECO\u201d, etc. and that can provide a good living again and not only subsistence. \n\n</span>\n\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<b><span>What policies?\n\n</span></b>\n\n<b><span>- EU policies for</span></b><span> subsidizing this kind of agriculture and Agro-Tourism\n\n</span>\n\n<span>- <b>Marketing</b> its products through all channels \n\n</span>\n\n<span>- <b>Campaigning</b> FOR MITTIGATING HUMAN ACTIVITIES\u2019 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\n\n</span>\n\n<span>- By <b>REWARDING</b> economically and socially those realizing these activities in order to create a PRIDE of living in Villages, working in eco-farms, \u00a0\n\n</span>\n\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cagro-eco-tourism\u201d, and a PRIDE of protecting the Environment.\n\n</span>\n\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>I\u2019ll stop here for now.

The social networks that we know and use nowadays, like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, were launched in 2005-2006 and started gaining immense popularity in 2007. Before these the most used platforms for sharing opinions were the Internet forums (message boards) and the blogs. In 2002, some people, including me, that were active on an online message board said: <em>Let\u2019s do something useful offline and involve more people</em>. We started with organizing free time activities, paper recycling and cleanup actions and continued with creating <em>Resurse</em> Youth NGO.\n\nOne of the largest projects that we implemented was titled <em>I vote!</em> and addressed the youth participation in Moldovan Parliamentary Elections 2005. We recruited 80 students from various departments of the main 6 universities from Moldova. They were the volunteers to whom <em>Resurse</em> offered training and promotional items. Their task was to attract attention to the message of the campaign and spread the word among their peers, by wearing the <em>I vote! \u00a0</em>T-shirts and badges, disseminating the flyers and engaging in conversation. The members of the NGO, including me, were also performing the same activities. We had the approval and support of the Universities\u2019 administration and we received some media coverage. We targeted a word-of-mouth effect, understanding that students would be more inclined to believe in a message coming from their colleagues, than from authorities or other formal sources.\n\nWe had other projects with similar approach, but various fields, like cultural diversity or education reforms (Bologna Process).\n\nOur work was mainly based on volunteering and time availability and it was an exceptionally rewarding experience. Due to the fact that most of the members, including me, went abroad or started to work full time after finishing the Bachelor studies, we had to stop the activity of the NGO.\n\nThus, beside a place to share opinions on an immense variety of topics, an online platform was the start and support of some <em>real life</em> activities with more beneficiaries.\n\nNowadays this kind of situation is more common, but it was something fairly special 10 years ago :) Another founding member of the <em>Resurse</em> NGO is also an <em>Edgeryder</em> - <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/liudmila\">Liudmila</a>.\n\nNow to describe the impact on my life... I was elected to be the leader of the NGO. I was 19. Most importantly, thanks to this experience, I met a lot of different people, in Moldova and abroad, and I learned a lot. Together with my best friends, which were also part of the message board and the NGO, we learned how to interact on \"professional\" grounds. At the beginning I learned <em>by doing</em> how to officially register a NGO, the reporting system etc. and the procedures are, in general terms, as for a company. We learned how to write project proposals (applying for grants). The members and volunteers of the NGO participated in some very interesting trainings in Moldova and abroad. Over time my communication, management and leadership abilities greatly improved. It was a first work experience that was also pleasurable. Although the organisation is not active anymore, it's impact is still felt. And it all began online.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-06 23:47:47", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 13:21:43.442845", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 599, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27922, "user_id": 41, "topic_id": 1096, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>not for loss social investment mechanism and licenses</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\nsome further links of mutually supporting concepts , in relation to an enclosed networked commons :\n\nbasket :\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(currency)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(currency)</a>\n\nopen capital :\n\n<a href=\"http://p2pfoundation.net/Chris_Cook\">http://p2pfoundation.net/Chris_Cook</a>\n\nnot for loss social investment mechanism :\n\n<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/ChrisJCook/social-investment-mechanism-12-03-09\">http://www.slideshare.net/ChrisJCook/social-investment-mechanism-12-03-09</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.opencapital.net/\">http://www.opencapital.net/</a>\n\n<strong>\"Open Capital is the concept of partnership finance through the sharing of risk and reward.

Also, I'd like to structure my thoughts on the social enterprise shift ER is going through in order to make a minimally\u00a0meaningful contribution! Precisely, talking about contribution, since a lot of action is taking place around Matera, here's my perspective from the co-living experience. Please, do take into account the immersion I went through only lasted 1 week.\n\nFirst off, let me start this tiny yet overwhelming fraction of my life by acknowledging the visionary Andrea Paoletti for giving birth to <a href=\"http://benetural.com/\">Casa Netural</a>, a co-working space set in Matera, Italy\u2019s southern rural environment. Actually I don\u2019t recall any other initiative as such, one that articulates an urban need into the wild by spreading dynamics of collaboration, reciprocity and inspiration. The idea is excellent, especially for a region suffering from youth migration where local development is key for the present and future of its territory.\n\nMy involvement in this project came through an initiative called Co-Living.\n\n<a href=\"http://benetural.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tiagook.jpg\" style=\"font-family: 'Fjord One', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(158, 158, 158) !important;\"><img alt=\"tiagook\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-857\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://benetural.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tiagook-300x150.jpg\" style=\"border: 0px none; vertical-align: top;\" width=\"500\"></a>\n\nIt is a parallel project consisting in living at Casa Netural for one week in order to organically foster the exchange of experiences, practices and projects. Having selected <a href=\"http://benetural.com/co-living-2/\">10 outsiders</a> and bringing them one-by-one to meet the community has expanded the dialogue from local to global.\n\nAnother particularly interesting concept is <a href=\"http://benetural.com/dove/\">Exploring Basilicata</a>. Benefiting from the presence of co-living participants and the need to explore the region, on the weekend we went on a 48 hour sightseeing roadtrip, not only on the lookout for beautiful landscapes, but for adventures \u2014we have now baptized Extreme Basilicata\u2014, and most importantly, visiting stimulating alternative projects from the region. Thus the community is now able to map out a network of local/regional heroes.\n\nTo describe Co-Living adequately, imagine a community that embraces every newcomer, listens and asks questions always with a big smile on their faces. Believe it or not, it is what future Co-Living participants will find in Matera. I still haven\u2019t figured out if this proximity is due to habits from rural contexts, to the curious community built around Casa Netural and/or that it actually has a relation with the city\u2019s humble history that has strengthened its social tissue\u2026 People listened \u2014despite my so called italian\u2014 to what I had to share, they invited me to their ancient-from-the-outside-yet-modern-on-the-inside homes, cooked amazing local dishes that nurtured long insightful conversations about the town and the territory.\n\nIt was part of my personal goals to have an objective perspective as I would be able to impartially understand the specific context of Matera. But to be brutally honest: I failed. Not only was a week not enough to have a general overview and profound comprehension of the territory. Also I was constantly bombed by information at all levels. Tourist level, as I had never seen such landscapes; at Casa Netural level as I had to discern the dynamics of a rural co-working space; at Matera/Basilicata level trying to identify what belonged to the past, present and future.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>My advice to future Co-Living participants is that if you want to have a concrete output from the week in Matera: choose your topic and work on it before you go on site. Only then will you make the most out of this intense week, for productivity's sake.</em></li>\n\n<li><em>And my advice to Casa Netural: the community could figure out what are the most important projects to work on locally so that, either Co-Living participants can develop one at the time bringing a certain continuity between them or each participant chooses amongst the possible projects which resonates most with themselves.</em></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOn a completely different note, one of the first things that struck me was the fact everyone kept on talking about bandi, which at first I thought it had to do with music bands. Little did I know bandi means \u201ccompetitions\u201d. And when combined with the impressive data: 85% of the Basilicata workforce comes from the public sector \u00ad\u00ad\u2014unless there is an elephant in the room that I haven\u2019t seen\u00ad\u00ad\u2014 this territory is highly subsidised, just like developing country receiving donations from the wealthy families.\n\n&gt; How might Basilicata become self-sustainable using its own resources?\n\nIt\u2019s not as if it was an impossible mission, in fact I perceived the willingness of doing things and doing them differently. Take Tommaso <span>as an example</span>\u00a0(<a href=\"http://schiumapostdesign.com/blog/\">here's some of his work</a>), a cool guy that studied 1 year abroad and quickly became homesick. Now that he\u2019s back in Matera, you\u2019ll find him always on the lookout for alternative plans in the city. Like him I met a community of interesting and curious people, which means there is a real demand for diverse thinking projects. Besides, as we all know,\u00a0with internet more and more people are getting connected to information coming from all over the world, awakening needs that might just come from urban/cosmopolitan contexts. Even if it sounds crazy or scary or both, I did recognise the same <em>hipster</em> adolescents you find in big cities such as Madrid\u00a0- for example -\u00a0taking the train from Bari where they study back to their villages where they live.\n\n&gt; Are we creating globalised world citizens with similar needs disregarding context of origin?\n\nIn final, Basilicata is an effervescent territory with lots of multiple flavoured bubbles emerging. On the one hand, it is an excellent way to attract entrepreneurs back to the rural regions, but on the other hand, there is a latent need for a territorial strategy, common objectives that will consolidate the path and canalise energies, only then will initiatives be coherent. If not, it might end up with weird experiments of all sorts that I personally don\u2019t want to see.\n\nMaybe an open innovation platform where citizens share their experiences on what has been DONE in Basilicata (cf. <a href=\"http://www.openideo.com/\">Open IDEO</a>) could come in handy. This is one way to learn from each others mistakes and evolute in an efficient collaborative way.\n\nI am most grateful to Casa Netural\u2019s community, to Laura Sa\u00f1udo for taking good care of me, and to Andrea \u2013 without him this would have never happen.\n\nSoon a short video will complement this post... to be continued.\n\nGrazie a tutti, Tiago\n\n", "created_at": "2013-05-23 17:22:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:05.146976", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1387, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 30.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3, 5, 1438], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12612, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1190, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>No idea</b>\n\nWhen I learned to use Views the option was simply there.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-18 12:08:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:11.776234", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11804], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12947, "user_id": 2042, "topic_id": 2707, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>About feminism</b>\n\nI believe we are trying to achieve exactly that. <span>There are many problems regarding women rights and gender perceptions in Georgia.

Por ejemplo, en la pregunta \u201c<em>\u00bfen qu\u00e9 medida conf\u00eda en el Gobierno para afrontar los problemas que atraviesa su pa\u00eds?</em>\u201d, 8 de cada 10 espa\u00f1oles \u2013 concretamente un 78% \u2013 opina no tener ninguna o muy poca confianza con el ejecutivo. Este resultado es parecido al obtenido en Alemania (80%), Francia (82%) y Polonia (82%), s\u00f3lo Gran Breta\u00f1a ofrece un resultado que difiere un poco (un 66%).\n\nEn la misma encuesta tambi\u00e9n se pregunta por la <strong>honestidad </strong>e <strong>integridad </strong>de los pol\u00edticos, ya sean del Gobierno o de la oposici\u00f3n. El resultado es demoledor, <strong>un 91% de los espa\u00f1oles opina que no conf\u00eda \u2013 o conf\u00eda muy poco \u2013 que sus pol\u00edticos act\u00faen con honestidad e integridad</strong>. El resto de los pa\u00edses encuestados ofrecen unos datos similares, destaca el caso de Polonia, un 96%, ello implica que casi todos los pol\u00edticos polacos son considerados no honestos o no \u00edntegros, s\u00f3lo 1 de cada 20 pol\u00edticos se salva. (Tambi\u00e9n es cierto que <a href=\"http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/les/representan/elpepiint/20110727elpepiint_3/Tes\">en otros pa\u00edses europeos esta situaci\u00f3n es muy diferente</a>).\n\nPor todo ello, es evidente que hemos llegado a un punto donde conviene utilizar un nuevo paradigma pol\u00edtico, un paradigma d\u00f3nde todos puedan participar de una forma efectiva, o sea, no s\u00f3lo cada 4 a\u00f1os mediante una urna.\n\nEste nuevo paradigma es el <a href=\"http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobierno_abierto\"><strong>Gobierno Abierto</strong></a>.\n\nUn <strong>Gobierno Abierto </strong>es una nueva manera de entender la relaci\u00f3n de la Administraci\u00f3n hacia la ciudadan\u00eda, el resto de administraciones p\u00fablicas y las otras organizaciones de la sociedad (incluyendo las empresas).\n\n<span>Es un cambio cultural</span>, seguramente el cambio m\u00e1s importante que han experimentado los gobiernos (las administraciones p\u00fablicas) en toda su historia.\n\nEn el fondo, el objetivo \u00faltimo de un Gobierno Abierto es posibilitar la finalidad m\u00e1xima de una democracia: <span>un gobierno hecho por todos y para todos</span>.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo se implementa un Gobierno Abierto?\n\nPues, como siempre, pasito a pasito.\n\nPor ejemplo: A finales del 2009 propuse al Ayuntamiento de Barcelona la realizaci\u00f3n de un servicio de datos abiertos (OpenData) como un primer paso hacia el Gobierno Abierto.\n\nSe define un <span>proceso de apertura de datos p\u00fablicos (</span><span>OpenData</span><strong>)</strong> como aquel proceso que ofrece los datos p\u00fablicos, de los que dispone la Administraci\u00f3n P\u00fabicas al alcance de la sociedad en formatos digitales, estandarizados y abiertos, siguiendo una estructura clara que permita su comprensi\u00f3n y fomentando su reutilizaci\u00f3n para cualquier uso.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de no pocos contratiempos, finalmente a principios del 2011 sali\u00f3 el <a href=\"http://www.bcn.cat/opendata\"><strong>OpenData BCN</strong></a>, el <a href=\"http://www.bcn.cat/opendata\">Portal de Datos Abiertos del Ayuntamiento de Barcelona</a>, (actualmente estamos inmersos en la primera gran revisi\u00f3n de este servicio).\n\nTambi\u00e9n desde finales de 2009 que participo en numerosas iniciativas para dar a conocer el movimiento OpenData... pero siempre postul\u00e1ndome desde la \u00f3ptica de la utilidad, de la <strong><em>tremenda </em>utilidad </strong>que os comentaba al principio, los movimientos, las plataformas, <strong>las ideas no sirven de nada si no son \u00fatiles para la sociedad</strong>.\n\nY no ser\u00e1n \u00fatiles si no mejoran la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos, que en el fondo es de lo que se trata.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-09 00:53:09", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 07:36:14.275236", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1132, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16683, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 1962, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>yes </b>\n\n\u00a0\n\nI support the idea of one-on-one workshops\u00a0\n\nas we have discussed in our inspiring conversations with Bembo already\u00a0\n\n\"<strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span>Mini-workshops</span></strong><br style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n<span>The idea key here is that they are held one-on-one, and exist outside the schedule.</span>\"\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-18 15:35:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.316704", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 144, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4422, "user_id": 2580, "topic_id": 4389, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>Hi Edgeryders,\u00a0</span>\n\nI\u2019ll use this post both as a personal introduction to the community and as an application to the position you\u2019re calling for.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s my story.\u00a0\n\nI've\u00a0been\u00a0communities\u00a0window-shopping\u00a0in\u00a0Bucharest for almost two\u00a0years\u00a0now\u00a0and\u00a0it's\u00a0been one hell of a ride, so I got excited and hopeful when I found out that Edgeryders is using it\u2019s disruption-identifying goggles on Bucharest\u00a0- you\u2019ll discover (and catalyze!) awesome things.\u00a0\n\nFrom start-up hubs, leadership communities and bootstrapped social enterprises to neighbourhood associations, autonomous cultural spaces and environmental protests, Bucharest is definitely happening. I\u2019m not saying this as a nationalist (cosmopolitanism is where it\u2019s at) nor as an entirely born-and-raised Romanian. Returning to native Bucharest as a fresh graduate after a 14-year stay in hectic Venezuela meant having to discover this city and its communities almost as a foreigner would. Lost in space and cultural references I didn\u2019t get, in a mix of awe, anxiety and sometimes disappointment. Yet after 4 years of discoveries, I wouldn\u2019t trade this for any other place (no, not even Berlin ;)).\u00a0My excitement and confidence in the future of this city comes from the fact that the effervescence of communities in Bucharest is real and they need all the support they can get - I would love to help Spot the Future map it and connect it to the larger Edgeryders community.\u00a0\n\nWindow-shoping for communities and projects with a cause wasn\u2019t a passive journey or a side-activity. It was driven by the need to have control over my life and work and to use my skills for a project larger than myself (since climbing the corporate ladder, building a family or owning property weren\u2019t the kind of things I was drawn to), so I began volunteering at several NGOs I felt close to (<a href=\"http://policycenter.eu\">youth work in precarious communities</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ce-re.ro/home\">neighbourhood community organising</a>, <a href=\"http://www.odaiacreativa.ro/pregatim-lansarea-fondului-orasul-in-vitrina-impreuna-cu-fundatia-comunitara-tara-fagarasului/\">place-making and tactical urbanism in shrinking cities</a>) while also building a community I felt was missing.\u00a0\n\nAddressing your questions,\u00a0\n\n(1) I\u2019m currently most focused on <a href=\"http://heymarie.ro\">HeyMarie.ro</a>, a community of Millennials discussing the big issues of early adulthood in a time of uncertainty but also of great potential for autonomy and self-starter culture. Based on our readers\u2019 stories, interviews and events, we curate conversations on work, relationships, body image, identity and representation. The goal is to empower young women and men into making bold life choices by presenting a wider spectrum of livelihoods and lifestyles than mainstream media has to offer. It is a collaborative project meant to offer choice, solidarity and representation of diversity (of identities, ethnicities, sexualities, cultures, lifestyle, occupations).\u00a0While still actively involved in the NGO projects mentioned above, HeyMarie is my main project at the moment.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(2) Monetising projects that aim at social change is a challenge encountered in each of the projects I contribute to. The way I try to solve them, at this point, is by getting this issue out in the open and hopefully starting a larger conversation about how social innovation can find funding without appealing to the charity argument. We must do better than that.\u00a0\n\n(3) Many incredible initiatives in Romania are still so disconnected that some don\u2019t even know of each other, much less work together. Spot the Future can connect them to each other, and to a wider network. I see Spot the Future as contributing to the\u00a0budding ecosystem of change-makers and social innovators that still fight individual battles when they\u2019re in fact carrying out work that benefits their entire communities. Spot the Future could take stock of all these initiatives &amp; makers, map and voice their pains and needs and potentially draft a guide to how to grow and be sustainable (even financially) in collaboration. For your 3 initiative challenge, I\u2019d invite <a href=\"http://casajurnalistului.ro\">Casa Jurnalistului</a>, <a href=\"https://centrulclaca.wordpress.com\">Claca</a> and a group of programmers for a hackathon on community-led citizen reporting tools.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s it for now. Happy to be joining the Edgeryders platform and very looking forward to making connection magic happen. \\m/\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-13 12:23:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:24.773478", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 813, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 2584], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31966, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4517, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>My pleasure</b>\n\nWe do hope to learn more about you until next week, Elena.

But we'll gladly get you travel booked to give you time for the unconference too!\n\nMore about the Council of Europe hosting this conference and details about the unconference setup in <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/2012/04/the-edgeryders-conference-connecting-the-edges-of-a-new-europe/\">this post</a>!", "created_at": "2012-04-02 10:14:01", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:01.017741", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 635, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 35.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19030, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1766, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Tell me where to send the music and logos...</b>\n\nI used mobygratis.com as a source for the music.

We write here its documentation.</em>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Goals</h2>\n\nSpot The Future research activities are about re-using the online conversation on the Edgeryders platform research data. The interface between conversation and research is technological. The Edgeryders website runs on a technological stack, and we need to think on how to enrich that stack so that:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>research can be conducted easily and cheaply</li>\n\n<li>without being in the way of conversation</li>\n\n<li>while being transparent about our research activities and methodology</li>\n\n<li>with an eye on long-term stewardship both of primary (posts, comments) and secondary (ethnographic coding) data.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWe came up with the following solution:\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Ethnographic research</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Coding on Edgeryders</h3>\n\nEthnographic coding happens on the platform itself. \"Coding\" in the ethnography context means assigning a keyword to a selection of text, typically a sentence or paragraph. For example, suppose you want to assign the tag \"cookies\" to the sentence \"This is a sentence.\". Coding on Edgeryders would result in assigning <a href=\"https://groups.drupal.org/node/22231\">RDFa attributes</a> to the sentence, like this:\n\n<code class=\"content-command\" style=\"\"><strong>&lt;span property=\"</strong>eoe:topic<strong>\"</strong> <strong>resource=\"</strong>[eoe:cookies]<strong>\"&gt;</strong>This is a sentence.<strong>&lt;/span&gt;</strong></code>\n\nThis tagging system can be used by everyone with the \"content manager\" role, but is for now just meant for being used by <a href=\"/u/inga_popovaite\">@Inga Popovaite</a> of course. Usage goes like this:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Creating a new tag.</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Go to the <a href=\"/admin/config/content/ckeditor_styles\">CKEeditor styles list</a> and click the \"Clone\" operation for a style whose name starts with \"eoe_\". (That means \"Edgeryders Online Ethnography\" and is a namespace we invented to mark these tags.)</li>\n\n<li>In the style form, adapt the \"Administrative Title\" field to be different from the original you cloned. For consistency, usually keep it the same as the \"Title\" field more below.</li>\n\n<li>Click \"Edit\" behind the \"Machine name\" field in the top of the form, and adapt it to start with \"eoe_\" followed by a short version of the Administrative title field, using only lowercase letters, digits and \"_\".</li>\n\n<li>Adapt the \"Title\", \"Property\" and \"Resource\" fields according to their field help texts.</li>\n\n<li>Click \"Save\".</li>\n\n<li>If needed, you can click \"Edit\" again to adapt all fields of your tag, except the \"machine name\" one. To adapt this, you have to clone your style rule and afterwards delete the original. Also note that these changes only affect new tagging activity. Old taggings use the old values.</li>\n\n</ol></li>\n\n<li><strong>Tagging some text.</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Click \"Edit\" for the piece of content you want to tag, or to proceed tagging (usually posts and comments).</li>\n\n<li>Select \"Text Format: Filtered HTML + Tagging\" below the editor.</li>\n\n<li>Select a piece of text that you want to tag.</li>\n\n<li>Click the \"Styles\" dropdown in the left of the editor toolbar and there, click the tag you want to use.</li>\n\n<li>When mousing over a tag for a second in the \"Styles\" dropdown, a tooltip with the full name will appear. This helps with long names that are not visible completely. The same tooltip also appears when mousing over tagged text in your editor. This lets you know which tag you used there, as only types of tags (like \"topic\", \"place\" etc.) will be optically distinguishable. (Means, optical rendering of tags will not regard for differences in the \"resource\" attribute.)</li>\n\n<li>Repeat as above, and when you're done select \"Text Format: Filtered HTML\" again and click \"Save\". Switching the text format back is important, because else the original authors (who can't use the tagging text format) would be disallowed from editing their own content. The tagging itself is kept of course, the difference is just that the editor will miss the list of tagging styles, and tags are not rendered visually.</li>\n\n<li>If you forgot to reset the text format before saving, you can of course edit the content again and fix this issue. It is also ok to keep the text format at \"Filtered HTML + Tagging\" as long as you are in your editing session (that is, using the \"Save and Edit\" button for saving your work every now and then).</li>\n\n</ol></li>\n\n<li><strong>Removing tags from text.</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>In the tagging editor, mark text from which you want to remove all tags.</li>\n\n<li>Click the \"Remove Format\" button in the toolbar (looks like <code class=\"content-output\" style=\"\"><em>T<sub>x</sub></em></code>). This will remove all formats from the text, both all tags and visual formatting.</li>\n\n<li>Re-apply tags you want to keep. This is relevant in cases where multiple tags had been applied at once.</li>\n\n<li>Re-apply visual formatting.</li>\n\n</ol></li>\n\n<li><strong>Power user mode.</strong> If anything goes really wrong with tagging, it can be fixed up again in the HTML source mode. For that click the \"Switch to plain text editor\" link below the tagging editor, and when done click \"Switch to rich text editor\". This mode is also great for removing tags while keeping other tags and visual formatting that is applied to the same text.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nKeep in mind that, for transparency reasons, users are allowed to see the tagging of their own content by navigating to their own posts and comments, clicking on \"Edit\" and then selecting \"Switch to plain text editor\". They can also see individual tags when \"accidentally\" mousing over tagged text, which will make a tooltip to appear, showing the tag's name.\n\n<span>TODO.</span> The following functionality is not yet implemented, but will be added soon:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A way to mark what nodes (including their comments) have been tagged already.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Analysis with a CAQDAS tool</h3>\n\n<a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>\u00a0will write a script that exports STF content in a format that can be imported with an open source CAQDAS tool. Like <a href=\"http://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/Weft-QDA.shtml\">WEFT-QDA</a>, but there are better alternatives (so far <a href=\"http://www.catma.de/\">CATMA</a> seems best, and it's also web-based). Inga can then explore the data using that tool.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Network analysis</h2>\n\nMost of the network analysis will use tools external to Edgeryders. The interface is the Drupal module Views-Datasource (already installed and enabled). This module allows to create queries to the Edgeryders database and export them in JSON format. <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/brenoust\">@brenoust</a>\u00a0will work together \u00a0to create the queries relevant here. Benjamin will then write the scripts that transform the JSONs into networks.\n\nWe wish to explore the relationships between social interaction (as represented by a network of comments) and semantics (as represented by ethnographic coding and perhaps output from natural language processing algorithms) in the STF conversation. To do this, Benjamin will write scripts to retrieve the tags from the full text of posts and comments.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-07 13:22:44", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:17.063286", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1296, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 66.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1974, 82], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10509, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3402, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Resources for generating visual sitemaps</b>\n\n<a href=\"http://astuteo.com/slickmap/\">slickplan.com</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-12 18:29:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:00.356245", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5108, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5075, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d2005a49f06a8b90ec3b92e2142b62743c68eb3c.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"469\"><br>\n\nWe are off to LOTE5 in 2016 in brilliant company. Our community event keeps cultivating an interest to confront failing narratives in culture and creative industries, a track <a href=\"/t/lote5/609/kickstarting-the-creative-cultural-industries-track-a-short?lang=en\">launched</a> by Matteo a few weeks ago. We need new frames to answer questions like why initiatives brewed in ill institutional culture stand little chance to produce lasting results; or why we need to change the cultural industry from being artifact oriented to social change oriented.\n\nMy guess is experienced minds like Robert (Bob) Palmer\u2019s can shed some light on this, and I\u2019m very excited to welcome him on board. Palmer has done cultural planning and research, and actual production. He worked for the Council of Europe in as a director on Culture and Cultural and natural heritage, served as board and jury member for various organisations and festivals, was the director of European Capitals of Culture (ECOC) (Brussels in 2000 being one of them!) and is now consulting independently for cities running for the title, including winners Matera 2019, and more recently Bucharest 2021. He has been one of Edgeryders friends and allies for some time now.\u00a0On a personal note, it took Bob for me to finally do work in Romania.\u00a0During an event, he said to us: <em>You can transform a city by using culture. I love working with messy cities. Bucharest is a messy city. And this is fascinating for me! Bucharest 2021 is a project that will enable other projects to act on the basis of active participatory democracy.</em>\n\nAt LOTE5, with several team reps involved in ECOC we will looking at cities as units of analysis and learning from their failures in cultural transformations. We\u2019ll go behind closed doors of what looks like a shiny title and aspiration, to discover the hidden struggles of the creative minds behind a bid and the larger things at stake. We are shaping the session in collaboration with those who want to attend, and you can <a href=\"/en/lote5/european-capitals-of-culture-failure-is-not-about-losing-the\">register for it</a> as early as now.\n\nAlongside Palmer, there are another 20 or so lovely people joining Living on the Edge from all walks of life, as <a href=\"/t/speakers/5066\">speakers or facilitators</a>. I can\u2019t imagine an annual ER gathering without long standing and new community members, but also people around us who are showing support in diverse capacities. From wherever you come from, you too can be a part of this. <a href=\"/t/getting-your-ticket/4915\">Start here!</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-18 12:16:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:29.559441", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 493, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 226.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11695, "user_id": 1692, "topic_id": 3723, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I think we could do it during the hackathon event (20th-24th of October)...\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-01 11:00:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:07.218329", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9301], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28578, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2748, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Great</b>\n\nLooking forward to this, learning about the initiative through the eyes of someone involved is always more interesting and can inspire more people to get involved..\n\n<span>This seems like a good spot for the post: <a href=\"/t/spot-the-future-caring-for-commons/559\">/t/spot-the-future-caring-for-commons/559</a>\u00a0We called the group Caring for Commons to hint at the fact that green spaces need all our care and protection to prevent them from being destroyed, bought, built on, anything that means the resource which is used by many is capitalized by a few and becomes a scarce resource.. \u00a0<span>You might wanna check this kind of reaction to a park in <span>Tbilisi</span> being sold to a construction company</span>:\u00a0 <a href=\"/arrivals/if-you-can-kick-us-out-of-our-parks-then-we-can-kick-you-out\">https://edgeryders.eu/arrivals/if-you-can-kick-us-out-of-our-parks-then-we-can-kick-you-out</a>\u00a0\n\nWe have a video interview with some of the movement's founders, so stay tuned :)</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-22 14:57:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:37.403055", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 231, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28071], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32771, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5480, "post_number": 25, "raw": "<b>Sustainable coordination, solutions-oriented communication....</b>\n\n...and feeling enabled to move from paralysis and sense of helplessness, towards contributing constructively (having a choice of involvement one feels comfortable with and a social contract stating that this is perfectly fine, any small contribution is very welcome etc).\n\nLearning from <a href=\"/t/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care-system/4880\">Helliniko's way of working and socialising everyone</a> who comes through the door....to tackle the challenges I tried to define/articulate out in <a href=\"/t/after-nowconf-how-can-mayors-funders-and-activists-collaborate-to-unfail-the-refugee-crisis/5201\">this post</a>.\n\nWhat is a social infrastructure and engagement mechanism that would allow for this?

Asking someone within the organization, who has spent considerable time working on progress(ing) inside the box, to turn around and walk away from it is likely to fail not only due to the cognitive biases that haunt our thinking. Another problem is that large organizations that refrain from admitting to failure or mistakes are seldom trusted to engage with criticizers in a fair way, especially if they have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign\">a record of not sticking to their rhetoric</a>. Thirdly, if they were really serious about getting out of the box, why handle this internally - why not go and talk to individuals and small organizations who <em>live </em>(not just think) outside the box? That being said, such an appeal <em>can </em>improve matters if words are backed up by action.\n\nUnfortunately, in practice many such measures to jump start innovation lead to stopgap measures or sacrificing long term gains for cash on hand - without addressing the underlying deficiencies that <em>forced </em>the organization from an orthodox path into untested waters.\n\nI would contend that long term successful innovation is foremost a cultural matter (especially defined by <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1110&amp;context=cahrswp\">what personalities and behaviors are perceived as appropriate or acceptable</a> in which roles) constrained by available resources. This would mean that the majority of (cultural/behavioral) effects can be expected to impact some 25-50 years after their respective causes are established. A second similarly important time would be when the customs and values indoctrinated into the first generation have been internalized during the socialization of the next generation and impact society. This would be expected to be due 50-75 years after initial changes were made. In consequence one can probably assume an impact distribution that peaks around 50 years after policy adjustments.\n\nIf behavioral changes are pushed for on a shorter timescale the cost would probably rise considerably as this would have to be done against the resistance of powerful elements of society that benefit from the status quo. Especially if the typical career duration of approx. 30-40 years is approached. In the aftermath of a disaster the resistance to change may be reduced significantly for some time - but it is rare that the mood is in favor of fundamental change and experimentation, over a stable and projectable future.\n\nThere are however many things that can be done on an organizational level (which strictly speaking also has cultural implications) that are met with significantly less resistance. In order of increasing potential resistance to change the are: affecting the routing and format of information, reorganization of sub-groups, internal (temporary or partial) change of roles, and change of relationships with other organizations.\n\nIn principle this is a very effective leverage point for relatively large change on relatively short timescales. However because this is so, a thriving industry of profit oriented change management organizations has established itself in the lucrative areas of this field. They generally have the competitive advantage of having similar narratives to those of profit maximizing organizations, using the same tools, and interfacing in familiar manner with the upper management. The unfortunate result is that the advice generally is limited to a small subset of solutions (usually short term catabolism) - often without any viable long term options between them, and the crowding out of unorthodox advice.\n\nAs a result I would rather focus energies on the organizations that do not have the means to pay for this service - even though they are providing a valuable but precarious service to society. Particularly deserving of attention would be the subset of organizations than can \"repay in kind\" without adversely affecting the normal operations (often the case in largely digital economies).\n\nThe national and international policy level is similar although (especially in the under-performing organizations) it not unlikely to suffer from one or two more layers of self-selection induced blindness and rigidity. On the other hand the field is significantly more diverse in many aspects, so that a lack of standards may allow for more unorthodoxy.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-05 12:25:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:42.443522", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 745, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2999, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 2966, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Since the first \\#LOTE event, education reality check and a topic of learning appears from thread to thread on the platform.\n\nOut of session on<a href=\"/t/learning-lote-session/1673\"> Learning</a>  and work of many, came a handbook for policymakers: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/113476764/Learning-on-the-Edge-Edgeryders-Learning-and-Educational-Experiences\">Learning on The Edge</a>\u201d published two years ago,<a href=\"/user/not%20yet%20assigned\"> </a>@nadia posted<a href=\"/t/learning-reloaded/1695\"> Learning Reloaded.</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tk7TdZzgO0L2lJ41FW9LMtWEI-_ybpB0PM594rbYVxU/edit\">Making a Living Reloaded</a> summarised dreaded flaws of conventional educational systems we all familiar with:\n\n<em>\u201cgap between the knowledge gained through educational process and the education required for actual jobs...Outdated curricula and domination of theoretical knowledge.\u201d</em>\n\nPros and cons of e-learning and e-learning platforms personal experiences<a href=\"/t/an-old-model-for-education/1570\"> were also discussed.</a>\n\nThough, Edgeryders is about doing and learning by doing, not moaning about education.

Is it human attention and warmth? Is it trying to fix what's wrong with people in need of care? Is it accepting everybody for what they are, with their strengths and weaknesses?</em></blockquote>\n\n<strong>Care is deeply human</strong>. Everyone has first hand experience of it. Even those of us who are not doctors or nurses or caregivers are occasionally patients (even doctors!); we all have first-hand experience of giving and receiving care.\n\n<strong>We are collecting stories of care</strong>... and using our collective intelligence to make sense of them. We hope to get to a shared view of what people are doing to cope when official systems fail, and how we can help the promising solutions to become more resilient and accessible to more people .

You have done a really good job. The Coe and Edgeryders team has done a great job as well.\n\nTo be honest with you, I had never seen any organization pull together an event (#LOTE) of this magnitude, in less than 3 months. Usually, it takes at least one year to prepare a conference. It must not always been easy for V\u00e9ronique Foreau and Malcolm Cox.\n\nIt was amazing to observe how citizens got included at every step of the process.\n\nIt is true that the Council of Europe behaved magnificiently... The cocktail at the museum was grandiose. What a fantastic setting!\n\nThe Edgeryders team also behaved magnificiently. Participants felt supported and loved. Members of the team did not receive a specific training about how to behave and collaborate with citizens, yet everything flowed well. You gave each teammate the freedom to be who they are. You empowered the team.\n\nI was especially proud to hear Gilda Farrell speak in French (twice) at the \\#LOTE conference. It has never been done before, using French in an even aiming at collaboration with citizens. I was proud to see 3 women closing the conference, and glad that they spole about other initiatives of the CoE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that it has been a fantastic learning experience for everyone. Citizens, and teammates, and hopefully too, the CoE officials, enjoyed the ride.\n\nThat is really good news, if the Edgeryders prototype can inspire more experimental projects. I was hoping that it would be replicated. It is such a big evolutionary leap from everything else done so far in terms of public-sector innovation, that it would have been a shame if there were no 'babies'.\n\n(Lovely pic.

Unfortunately, frequently its use is somehow restricted. Sometimes there is the unpleasant note \"<em>\u00a9 all rights reserved</em>\", but often there is no copyright information at all, which is not so different: you are not authorized to use the work.\n\nFor instance, if you go on the website of an university professor, you often find lecture notes and other educational work. You can assume that you can read and print them and use them for studying, but what else? Can you give them to a friend? What about adapting them for use in another course?\n\nYou can easily find images with search engines like Google Images, and they could be great tools if you have, say, to write an article, a leaflet, or the slides for a talk. Usually people pick images they like and use them without even thinking about copyright; but copyright exists, and it's not always true that they can do it.\n\nMost of the times the author will be glad to let you use his work, albeit not always. Maybe he would like to be cited in one way or another; maybe he would allow only certain kinds of use; maybe it's OK to use it, but not to modify it. The point is that you cannot know, unless the author makes it clear. You can always write an email to him (if you know his email address), but you probably won't. This is the reason why clearly stated licenses are so useful: they let you know exactly what you can do and what you can't.\n\nThis is the greatest achievement of <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org\">Creative Commons</a>: Creative Commons are a set of modular, standardized, easily understandable licenses. Every <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_licenses\">Creative Commons license</a> says: \"at least to some extent, you can use my work, and you can give it to a friend, forever; but if you do give it to a friend, say him that I am the author\". There are six different licenses, depending on how the author answers to two questions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>do you want to allow people to use you work also for commercial purposes?</li>\n\n<li>do you want to allow people to modify your work?</li>\n\n</ul>There are two possible answers (yes or no) to the first question, and three to the second one (yes, no, or \"<em>ShareAlike</em>\", which means: yes, but you have to release your modifications under the same license): 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 different licenses.\n\nThis is also one of the most important differences between <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org\">Wikimedia Commons</a>, the media archive of Wikimedia (used by Wikipedia and other projects), and many other archives (or the web in general): for each file are clearly stated the license and (usually) the author and the source.\n\nIf you do not know anything about these licenses, Creative Commons people have written real \"human readable\" (not \"lawyer readable\"!) of the licenses, like <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">this one for Creative Commons by-sa</a>.\n\nThey have also written a machine-readable version of their licenses: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework\">RDF codes</a> that, embedded for instance in a web page, can make clear to a search engine or a browser under which license the work is released. This is implemented for instance in Google Image, where you can<a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?answer=29508\"> restrict to images under certain licenses</a>.\n\nI have not talked at all about why you should share you work; I hope it is clear to us all. My point is that you should make it explicit; you should ask yourself: \"do I want to allow people to use my work? and how?\". And, in any case, you should clearly state how, and a Creative Commons license is the most effective way. And you should do it each time you put your work on the web.\n\n(By the way, do you know that everything you write on <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/page/legals\">Edgeryders is released under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported</a>, isn't it?)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-03 17:15:50", "updated_at": "2017-09-13 14:47:58.090084", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 741, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1783, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1750, "post_number": 1, "raw": "So i've been going through all the fabulous material produced by <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/cataspanglish\">Cataspanglish</a> on how people who are doing interesting work are making a living outside the mainstream.

It is by no means an exhaustive research initiative, more a curated collection. What follows are my personal reflections around for me core points. Work: exploration, investment, production\n\n<blockquote>\"I do think that as a society and employers need to think a lot harder about training though. A lot of companies seem to have stopped doing this, which is a mistake on their part, but it's one of those short term cost, long term gain things - and of course, companys that do, run the risk of training people who then get poached by company's that don't. Tax breaks for education may be one way to address that \" -<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/quest-paid-work/mission_case/difficult-definition-job#comment-1750\"> Jacky</a>\n\n</blockquote>\n\nIt seems that several people have done, or are doing, a combination of temporary and or freelance work to pay the bills, and creative exploration of their environment or particular obsessions such as getting a creative venture (such as a start-up), running. Many report that it was actually their general meanderings off the `straight and narrow\u00b4 (creative experimentation without set agendas, side projects for \"fun\", hobbies and or volunteering as opposed to say pursuing a degree program) that lead to their generating income or initatives that generated work and or social value for their communities. How have they been doing it more precisely? Here is a starting list- feel free to add more!\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Chase Buzz terms: Try new technologies out and become proficient at using them</li>\n\n<li>Experiment with different forms of self-expression to tell stories about who you are and the worlds you live in till you find your style that resonates with more people- especially writing. Pick something which you can do consistently over a long period of time so people can find you and you can develop an audience.</li>\n\n<li>Be open and social: make it easy for others who might be interested in what you do to find and engage with you. Pete did it by telling people where he would be on a regular basis and inviting people to come meet him there to talk about social media, offering to help newbies get started, or those curious to explore it a bit without a major commitment.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThe terms \"freelance\" and \"temporary\" seem to imply something about the duration and conditions of the work which at first look are obvious. But when I asked myself more detailed questions I realised they are ambiguous; I am unsure whether in each case people were referring to cash-in-hand, short term or medium-term or something else. I am also not clear on whether the work required specialised skills only gained through years of practicing a craft...or copy-pasting data into excel documents. If my own experience is anything to go by, you need, are able to and want to do different kinds of things depending on the situation and what you are trying to achieve.\n\n<blockquote>\u201cthe whole process of recruitment - CV based in a linear way, even on something like LinkedIN, which bears no relation to how a growing number people earn their living\"</blockquote>\n\nSo how are connections between work and people being made and how much can we influence this- as individuals, as groups, as societies? Several Edgeryders have mentioned the importance of their personal networks in helping them to find work. It\u00b4s not just the number of connections though, is it? I personally have a large personal network. The shape of the network is such that there are a lot of people in it that I could turn to to be put in touch with venture capital or to get credible data and deep insights on telecommunications infrastructure, and game design- you get the idea. Finding temporary work for a couple of weeks cleaning fish in Norway to earn a quick injection of cash for expensive equipment I need for an installation? Not so much.\n\nSo how would I find the work I need or make it easy for people looking for someone to do that kind of work to find me? One topic I think we need to explore in much more detail is networks, what they are how they seem to be composed and how we can make them better or more useful for sustaining us. As individuals, as groups and communities. If by work we mean income generation, some Edgeryders are trying to do this by generating revenue directly from their work such as by selling services and in some cases products. Here are some insights gleaned from the posts on Edgeryders- please feel free to add your own:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Selling your own work is more difficult than working for others</li>\n\n<li>Switch to offering services or products more suited to smaller wallets</li>\n\n<li>Get your objects into selections made by others</li>\n\n<li>Set up your own e-commerce with easy to use, personalisable applications such as Blomming</li>\n\n<li>Produce remix-friendly designs as possible alternative path of revenue..</li>\n\n<li>Produce designs for 3-d printing or laser cutting to be sold online e.g. through shapeways.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nMany more it seems have tired their hand at formalised recruitment processes through job centres and online applications.... Matching work and people\n\n<blockquote>\"..hiring is hard, finding a job is hard, and that both are extremely time consuming if you approach them properly. Also there's a lot of specific instances that people are generalising rather badly from. For example a lot of jobs really are highly specialised, and require very real skills. Would we want people to hire brain surgeons or nuclear power station engineers by thinking \"creatively about their candidate potential\"? I rather suspect not. \" \" I can't find the statistics right now but if you look at the most efficient ways to get an highly qualified job, either in Italy or abroad, you can just forget the CVs as a first-contact method. What really works is networking. \"</blockquote>\n\nFormalised recruitment processes, it seems, leave much to be desired for many reasons. While they may or may not work, the impression I get from several of the discussions both on and off Edgeryders is they are ill suited for many different kinds of work and professional profiles. On the candidates side they can be quite a humiliating experience or a frustrating one that leaves a lasting bad impression of the people and organisations doing the recruiting. Too much focus on formal requirements (e.g. a degree) or traditional organizational arrangements (e.g. they don't trust long-distance work) can automatically block promising candidates due to their not being picked up in a database search etc.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"http://cookiesncode.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/idontknowwhatiwantclient.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-363\" height=\"507\" src=\"http://cookiesncode.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/idontknowwhatiwantclient.jpg\" title=\"IDONTKNOWWHATIWANTCLIENT\" width=\"458\"></a>\n\nOk the above image refers to designers but really I think the bottom left square illustrates a situation I come across through the descriptions of Edgeryders and my own experiences from both sides of the coin. When looking for work and or for people to do it we often don\u00b4t know what we're really looking for. What we have done in the past does not necessarily reflect where we want to go in the future; future by definition is sort of fuzzy. Especially if we are pushing boundaries or exploring the possibilities enabled by new technologies.\n\n<blockquote>\" I have had the chance to write the job description and the ideal candidate description for some positions. Never once have I required experience: it did not feel realistic, maybe the stuff I do is just too weird and the whole point is that there is no experience to go around, because it is supposed to be, you know, new. So I am really not the one to ask. \"</blockquote>\n\nIf you are recruiting someone for a long-ish term position it\u00b4s a huge investment and more often than not, we may percieve that can not afford to take risks or trust people to do a good job. So a formal process would force us to be superficially specific without allowing for us to be surprised and discover people, approaches and competences that can generate a lot of added value to us, but that we didn't know we needed or would have known how to ask for! I\u00b4ll take my own example.\n\nAt a certain point in my working life I ended up working as a cook in restaurants. I only did it for a while, and didn\u2019t have any professional training- but I did get it through a job centre. Turns out the job itself was over hyped- all it really required was that you show up, peel a lot of vegetables, heat and serve pre-processesed foods and clean up meticulously after each working day.\n\nThe job description made it out to be a highly demanding job requiring specialist skills but it really wasn\u2019t, they could just have said: We\u2019re looking for person to mostly prepare pre-processed foods and a couple of salads every now and then. You need to be clean, have high work ethic and be willing to do repetitive tasks but on the upside the money\u2019s not bad. There is no way from the description I could have guessed what it was about, and if they had asked about qualifications I would have been filtered out as a candidate even though the job certainly didn\u2019t require it.\n\nI am very grateful I got the chance to do the job though, as it lead to other work with food where I discovered a personal passion for working with food. It was many years ago since I had any real experience from being in a kitchen...and then it was only for a short while. But it has never left me- something I would love to do is run a mobile food truck service. I am going to need to start earning some <em>extra</em> money to pay for the costs of:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Getting a driver\u00b4s license</li>\n\n<li>Doing some kind of formal food-related certification course- not sure what you need yet</li>\n\n<li>Setting up the food truck, and buying ingredients.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nLong term is off- I would much prefer well-paid short term work . So I am asking myself what cash in hand or short term work is out there? Babysitting, gardening, selling stuff on the beach. There never seem to be enough plumbers and electricians around. Especially at odd hours. And Estheticians/ hair dressers they often seem to be booked days or even weeks in advance.\n\nAny more? I am quite open to proposals barring prostitution or working for tobacco/arms industry. What kinds of odd jobs have you done in the past and how did you get them? Cash in hand, Short term, medium term, long term work- Highly specialised or skilled vs generic, specific vs fuzzy descriptions. How to find it as individual, as group as community- can we use our networks in some smart ways to do this?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-01 19:01:57", "updated_at": "2017-09-09 18:38:33.191187", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1990, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 130.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2245, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 2212, "post_number": 1, "raw": "These write ups are to be compressed into The Read before The Form Storm Instruction&amp;Code of Conduct.\n\nAs I mentioned in the <a href=\"/t/formstorm/348-group/formstorm-3hour-online-edition-write-up-on-preparedness-homework-and-priorities\">Preparedness, Homework and Priorities Write Up</a>, we don't need to reinvent anything but to borrow and remix.\u00a0\n\nSo the preparation stage looks like the standard preparation to the academic conf workshop. The actual 3 hours have a spirit of a hackathon, but reduced and distilled to 3 hours length. Sounds quite scary, but we will deal with burn-out prevention later. The format that I would like to borrow and remix is the one from LOTE3, I think it was The unRule Session, and it was a very neatly structured 3 teams session with reporting.\u00a0If you can find it, please ping me, I should link it to this post.\n\nSo how do we squeeze a hackathon into 3 hours event.\n\nThere will be several forms, corresponding to the number of projects. Each project/form has a separate group of FormStormers.\n\nThe main point of the FormStorm and each form/project group working simultaneously is p2p support, skill&amp;valuable info sharing, peer-review and other aid to stay motivated and make sense.\n\nSo the groups should communicate.\n\nI suggest, we look into these types of communication (use them all or make a pick):\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Hourly group to group crash-presentation. (Q: should it be hourly or other?)\n\nAnd types of communication which correspond to the roles. The choice of roles depends on whether the FormStormer prefers to function in a lightbulb mode or in a laser.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Laser Mode is good for finding key words in your own form, formulating questions and filling in forms carefully.</li>\n\n<li>Light Bulb Mode (good for spying and answering questions) has two roles.</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>FormStormers Free to Ping: one per group individual who is volunteering to be bothered by other group with questions and cries for help while others are 100% concentrating on the form.\n\nThe Free To Ping One should not be doing nothing, though. Should be focusing on the form too, just not be irritated when asked for help by members of another group.\n\nThe Free to Ping One is better be one individual throughout the whole FormStorm, to prevent the whole group from going HDAD, forgetting which form is theirs and mixing it all up.\n\nThe Free To Ping One, ideally self-selected according.</li>\n\n<li>Spies. FormStormers who can peek into another group to see how is it going, and\u00a0 choose which group to interact with during the hourly one.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe can remix a format I've seen at LOTE3 and customize it for FormStorm. It was very structured, I like it.\n\n<strong>OPEN</strong>\n\nThe FormStorm can either be opened with\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>a short, very short pitch. The necessity of the pitch depends on the level of preparedness, acquaintance with the forms/projects of others, ideas about who knows what in which group, and main problems that each groups are facing. Thats a lot of information, so 1point to the high level of preparedness.</li>\n\n<li>mixing groups&amp;matching knowledge/skills with problems</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nfor that we will need to have rough ideas about fields of expertise of each FormStormer.\n\n<strong>THEN</strong>\n\nContrary to the standard format of brainstorming, the divergence and chaos of creativity can either happen before the FormStorm or not happen at all, because its the stage which is the most difficult to close and move on.\n\nHowever, little bit of chaos of creativity and deconstruction can save projects which are stuck by applying a bit more radical solutions, such as:\n\n\"your project sucks, my project sucks, but is we merge them two it's all good.\"\n\nThis will not necessarily happen, but is possible.\n\n<strong>TOWARDS THE END</strong>\n\nI think this is the time for the final peer-review and very final brush up.\u00a0\n\nChocolate ice cream, a nap.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFormStorm will also needs overall facilitation and might benefit from helpers which don't have projects and forms at the moment, but would like to help out with something.\n\nThis is a lot of people. I will do tech challenges and how to go about it in a separate write up.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-23 07:54:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:11.879091", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 792, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32592, "user_id": 10, "topic_id": 1033, "post_number": 24, "raw": "<b>This is very exciting!</b>\n\nGreat points Matthias, Alberto and others!\n\nIndeed it is important to distinguish between the actions of individual edgeryders and the services that some Edgeryders memebers would provide. I think we need to work on several key principles of an Edgeryders SocEnt like those of Rochdale or Burning Man. They would come in handy in hypothetical moments when Edgeryders would be asked to deliver services to oil companies, corrupt and/or violent governements, TNC, ... you get the point.\n\nFor me the trouble is imagiing how would the organization look like. Here, I think some lessons could be learned from such structures as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_qaeda#Ideology\">Al Qaeda</a>. The secret to their longevity is the fact that that they are based on a specific ideology and a very loose structure spanned worldwide. With enormous (!) amounts of money targeted at destroying it, with losses in leadership it manages to remain resilient for more than 2 decades. Similarly many positive elements could be drawn from Anonymous.\n\nI hereby subscribe to the proposal of giving the Edgeryders a more formal/de jure structure. I guess it will be up to all of us to further propose, discuss and vote on the final form it will be taking. Perhaps it is obvious for the rest of you, but my only caveat would be that Edgeryders would maintain a culture of noncooperation/civil disobedience in relation with the insitutions/structures that are (partly) responsible for the proliferation of impoverishment, violence, environmental degradation, democratic deficit... We should avoid collaborating with such institutions whose aim is improvement of their own image in the eyes ofthe wider public, simulation of social responability, creating marketing stunts to gain a wider customer base, etc.\n\nIt's a great pleasure to be follwing this conversation.

Bob: a lot of the times it is about finding allies inside, people who are open minded and who will open doors for you.\n\n\n### Edgeryders idea: Let's build a Global Culture Team, a traveling squad!\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>committed group building partnerships in multiple cities to advance the agenda of grassroots movements </li>\n\n<li>works on the ground helping connect local initiatives with partners in Edgeryders network</li>\n\n<li>new team confirgurations deployed everywhere we go helps carry the knowledge from one local context to the other</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n### Followup session on Sunday\n\nYesterday's discussion started with presenting the cases of Matera 2019, Galway 2020 and Bucharest 2021. Failure has been recognised as pervasive in the ECOC space. The consensus is that an important part of it is political, and there is not much we can do as grassroots operators on the edge. A proposal was made to start an international network around ECOC. \n\nBob: There are many international movements doing great things. They tend not to be connected, so I would be very interested in knowing how that can be leveraged to transform larger communities \u2013 cities. \n\nAlberto: however, coordination is expensive. We make an effort to coordinate, we should have a clear benefit for that effort.\n\nThe proposal of an international network around ECOC makes sense because:\n\n* ECOC processes are \"attention machines\", where people with resources are more likely to be open to new proposals\n* International dimension is a requirement for winning.\n\nNiall \u2013 I concur. Galway now needs projects to win the ECOC 2020 title. We are very open to ideas and proposals, and I think this development is very exciting. \n\nNoemi \u2013 Cities do not understand grassroots networks. When I was working for Bucharest 2021, they did not get what we did. It would lower our coordination costs very significantly if we could say \"Well, we bring to the table a planetary scale network of creatives with low barriers to collaboration \u2013 we speak Euro English, we are good at working over the Internet, we can really strengthen your bid. \n\nAlex \u2013 How do you play out the situation where people in the community refer to cities in competition with each other?\n\nBob \u2013 Well, people like you tend to care about their projects, not about the competition. I don't see a problem.\n\nAlberto \u2013 We approached Cluj, also running for 2021. Noemi is from Cluj and cares about her city. But they would not play ball. So we went for Bucharest. Our loyalty goes to the community. \n\nNiall \u2013 Galway is prepared to take the lead on this, in the next two-three weeks. \n\nThom: we risk looking at the finger, but not at the moon. We need place-making; describes some projects he is working on, focused on some smaller towns around Galway. They need physical sites and involve rituals (?). \n\nNoemi: We can prototype it right away, using our work for Galway. We'll reach out to the network, explain what's going on, ping specific people, try to build matches. \n\nBob \u2013 Galway is not going out to call for ER projects, but it is prepared to host, to open up. This is a rare opportunity, and it should be reaped to its fullest. \n\nLady from Maastricht \u2013 Maastricht lost the bid. This ended up creating a lot of negativity, pessimism, and some great ideas were thrown away. Would it be possible to prevent this?\n\nNiall \u2013 We should make a Losers Network (laughs)!\n\nNatalia and Justyna \u2013 In Poland, the winning city (Wroclaw) built a coalition of all cities who had run. They meet every quarter, and have co-opted some of the projects there.\n\nNoemi: We need to decide what this network is going  to look like. The normal Edgeryders way (low risk) is: we keep doing what we're doing and hope to involve more people. The second option is: we start from a division of Edgeryders. That gets a corporate entity, banking etc. If it takes off, we spin a separate office. It's important to make it clearer what the services in culture are, and maybe also in development (having UNDP people in the room)\n\n<em>Discussion now drifts into connected area of what ER has to offer and how we pack projects.</em>\n\nMillie and Giulio: Edgeryders needs a one-liner, and needs projectification. In UNDP, if we hire McKinsey, we do not get fired. So they do not need one-liners, they can just say \"we are consultants, we help you do stuff\". <strong>ER needs the brochure</strong>.\n\nBob: Large consultancies get hired because they have methodologies, and they own them. You may not like them, but they are there. \n\nAlberto: (I like a methodology brochure better than a projects brochure).\n\nJohn: Facilitate non-joiners and the <strong>co-discovery of ideas</strong>. When you have something that's inherently vague as ER, there are a huge number of connections that came from it that need to be made visible\n\nGiulio: The problem you solve for me is allowing me to work with the uncontractables: I don't know who they are, I don't know how good they are, and they would not work for me anyway. With CDP [a bank Edgeryders is talking to], you are solving a risk management problem.\n\nAlberto: We are methodologists. We use collective intelligence to deliver expert advice. \n\nBob: I think your Unique Selling Proposition has to verticalize: delivering that in the field of X, for some value of X. \n\nTom: What about a definition around who the people in the community are? I propose \"Hackers\", writ large. \n\nNiall: For me it's about the <strong>smart people</strong> who are constantly pushing the boundaries (agrees with Tom on the hackers idea).\n\nJustyna: Here's a problem: using our own vocabulary is failing our sales efforts. \n\n<ul>\n\n<li>You need to speak the language of the client, and pitch benefits, which doesn't necessarily mean you're dumbing it down! </li>\n\n<li>You have to pitch benefits, not features</li>\n\n<li>You have to first position yourself in the pool with competitiors, to be able to differentiate (even when the case is that \"the customer defines the product\" Niall)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAlberto: Yet, a lot of government talk is buzzword driven\n\nBob: You are selling... I'll call it <strong>Edgethinking</strong>. Many more people are getting interested in Edgeryders. Also, be careful of your pricing! You can price higher as you get more established. \n\nNoemi: Our offer on the table as Edgeryders: we are making a more structured culture team. Please help us figure out how to make it easier for you to come and work together. Also, Bob, Giulio, Millie, help us figure out how to make your work easier, and to develop further our relationship to the stars.", "created_at": "2016-03-03 11:54:42", "updated_at": "2018-05-03 22:11:50.203011", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1430, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 30.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31128, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2942, "post_number": 30, "raw": "<b>A policy tool version of your abstract</b>\n\nHello @Inga Popovaite, here's a rewording of your abstract that takes a more hands-on angle.

Spain is at 50% youth unemployment and nearly 25% total unemployment, with 20% being the tradition unemployment figure associated with civil unrest.</span>\n\n<span>Both of these societies fought wars for an alternative to capitalism, lost those wars to capitalism, and are now being shafted by capitalism. It\u2019s time we seriously thought about what this might mean for the European Union, and our personal lives.</span>\n\n<h2>Distinguishing War and Revolution</h2><span>The Libertarians have a very good analysis of war. They think of the fundamental human right as the right to \u201cself-ownership\u201d - that your body (and mind) are yours and entirely yours and nobody should be able to force you to do what you do not choose to do. As with many simple principles, this is subject to the Calculus of Competing Virtues. \u201cYour freedom to swing your arm ends at the start of my nose\u201d as the famous saying goes. A very great deal of effort is spent trying to square Libertarian self-ownership with, for example, planetary ecological limits - it\u2019s not clear that a system which assumes the fundamental political truth is about human freedom is capable of navigating the extremely severe limits to action which appear to be necessary to protect the planet, for instance.</span>\n\n<span>But back to the analysis. Libertarians model most political problems in terms of property rights, in terms of theft. Theft of property is theft of the Past, of the work you did to create or acquire something. Murder is theft of the Future, of all the future potentialities of the being killed. Imprisonment etc. are theft of the present, denying people freedom to do what they will with their property, their body and mind. This model is appealingly uni-polar, a single principle from which all (political) truth can be generated, and I don\u2019t buy it, but it\u2019s as useful as a flashlight in the dark when we want to ask what War fundamentally is, and Revolution to boot.</span>\n\n<h4><strong><span>\"War is the continuation of </span><span>Politik</span><span> by other means\" - Carl von Clausewitz</span></strong></h4><span>In this analysis, War is when one State attempts to steal or destroy the property of another State.</span>\n\n<span>Revolution is when the People of one State attempt to reassign property within that State.</span>\n\n<span>Right now, Europe appears to be in a position where some countries are approaching Revolution. However, I think this is an inadequate political analysis - in fact, the truth comes much closer to war.</span>\n\n<span>The problem is that the Euro does not belong to the Greeks or the Spanish - or even the Germans. Euros, individual units of currency may belong to them, but The Euro does not. The Euro is property of an entirely nebulous entity of uncertain political definition. The problem we have is that they are sloshing around the continent like water in a bath-tub, and the usual fiscal measures taken by governments to keep the water in their own national bucket are not working. Money lent to the Greeks accumulated interest, long bets did not pay off, and pretty soon they owe more than they have to nations they have no control of. Because the Euro is the Euro, they can\u2019t use inflation to escape this trap which is the classic strategy, and we have an accidental economic war, in which Greek property is being reassigned to the Germans and many others by implosion, in an environment where EU membership requires them to keep their assets available for on the market at firesale prices. The good ship Europe sailed well in times of growth, but was never designed for Recession - any more than the Titanic was designed to stop Icebergs with its hull.</span>\n\n<span>In a Revolution, the action is within nations. The property rights being reassigned are within a pre-existing national political unit. Although the revolutionary factions in Greece and Spain may see their struggles as purely national, the Euro is a shared asset of many governments, and everything which affects its destiny bridges borders. There is no way to confine the situation inside of national boundaries, any more than pollution in a river can be confined upstream.</span>\n\n<span>We are all in this together, regardless of whether or not there are boots on the ground, and the unique confluence of nation-state interests bound together as the Euro is a unique political asset. There is no more National boundary on Revolution, it\u2019s all War now.</span>\n\n<span>Now let us consider our options here.</span>\n\n<h2>Trapped in the Boundries between Nations</h2><span>We can\u2019t easily vote out way out of this trouble. Elections are every few years, and no parties exist which have an appropriately fast-moving and accurate political and economic analysis to understand how to get us out of this mess. The pan-European truth is very simple: if we are going to be liable for each-other\u2019s welfare and debts, if we are to have a pan-European Democratic Socialist Social Contract in a manner recognizable from Finland to Spain as the same deal, we\u2019re going to need political parties in each nation which work on dismantling national boundaries to create a European superstate. Right now our political parties in Europe because they are elected nationally and make law nationally have only very indirect policies on international matters, even though the simple truth is that vast amounts of real economic power now reside at the European scale.</span>\n\n<span>What it means is that nations are being plunged into poverty and causing chaos for their neighbours in the midst of a political process (continental unification) which may or may not succeed, and for which there is very little coherent political theory or political practice. Everybody sorta-knows it is happening but the sides are poorly defined, and there\u2019s little international cooperation to push the course of events one way or the other. Even the greens are balkanized and national.</span>\n\n<span>So, then, to resilience. It\u2019s going to hit us hard, this process, and there will be troops on the ground in at least two countries within two years (90%) probable. Local revolutionary efforts to reallocate property to allow people to survive the crisis will be treated much more like political secessionist movements, because the basic European legislative fabric tears so badly when (for example) a nation sets up border controls or changes import/export policies. Changing the rules radically in a single nation (Revolution) takes on an international dimension (War) when everything is bound together by such tight international treaties.</span>\n\n<span>The money in your pocket and the passport in your bag allow you to travel all over the continent, and that\u2019s why what\u2019s happening in the South of Europe is closer to War than Revolution, when it becomes fully activated.</span>\n\n<span>So let\u2019s talk about what this means for us.</span>\n\n<h2>Modern War in Europe</h2><span>Modern war in Europe is not going to be shelling of cities and airstrikes. Enough was learned in Kosovo to avoid that at all costs. However, if (for example) Basque separatists decide to protect that most functional and productive portion of Spain by detaching it and applying for UN and EU protection, it\u2019s not hard to imagine a border conflict as Spanish interests attempt to keep it in Spain. That kind of stuff could easily turn into proper, \u201chard\u201d war up-to-and-including surface to air missiles and so on. Tough guys in hill country and make a stand against modern armies.</span>\n\n<span>But it\u2019s the cities that really fascinate me. The cities are the new horizon in conflict. It\u2019s the water and sanitation and food supply and natural gas lines and electricity cables which make up the new landscape of war, particularly in a European theater where nobody wants to kill anybody, where there\u2019s no fundamental ideological and nationalistic blood lust, but a sad, sorry cluster**** of competing interests which have made a worse mess than anybody ever imagined. It\u2019s urban warfare in Europe that everybody fears, the Kosovo scenario playing out in the South.</span>\n\n<span>So finally, having framed the threat, let\u2019s talk about resilience in this model.</span>\n\n<span>I\u2019m a hard resilience guy. I\u2019m not al that interested in social resilience, in people being nicer to each other in times of crisis, in what prevents people being so vulnerable to stress. I\u2019m a hard resilience guy, I think in terms of food and water and power and communications. I think about life and death. I foresaw conflicts of this kind many years ago, really started the work around 2002 or 2003 after the Euro was created because I did not think the world financial system could be stable with two reserve currencies - in the bimetallic period, the destructive oscillations between gold and silver wiped out stable international trade over and over again.</span>\n\n<span>If you are in Spain or Greece, either in the big cities or near the borders, and particularly at ports, there is a substantial risk of fighting and a near-certainty of supply chain and grid issues within two years. Obviously this could all hit much, much sooner than that, but the other shoe is not far from dropping, and two years is a good horizon to think about. Sooner than 2015. That\u2019s pretty damn soon. It\u2019s not enough time to finish a college degree or publish a novel, really. Faster than that come battle, in many scenarios. We can never know for sure, but it\u2019s hard to miss the signs now.</span>\n\n<span>Think of it as a tear in the fabric of society, the fabric of the grid. People arguing over property rights draw guns, or threaten to do so, and more people arrive to keep the peace. But now everybody is freaking out, and so capital and trade flee the area. If fighting starts, the flight of capital and trade accelerates - shops close, people no longer deliver to the area, business grinds to a halt - and there may be destruction of physical assets too, like water pipes and power cables and bridges. These are not likely to be wars of annihilation against populations, nobody hates each-other that much in Europe any more, but wars about the structure of local laws and about who gets to sign agreements. Administrative wars, if you will. And Chaos radiates out from the tear in the Civility of Administrators. <strong>War is the continuation of Bureaucracy by other means.</strong></span>\n\n<span>So one more time, back to resilience. Pipes and Wires and Radio Waves, Trucks and Boats and Planes. That\u2019s everything, more or less, that brings services to your doorstep. All those systems are owned, and many of them by international or foreign owners. All of them are governed, many by international or foreign treaties and standards bodies. The internet is IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) incarnate, for example. As the bureaucratic systems tear and lose interoperating civility (a key concept) the total economic and life-support throughput of the system crashes. People get suddenly poorer - you need an artificial hip and you\u2019re not going to get one. The young do well, the old are only as well taken care of as their family ties require, and people who can get by when things are good (the diabetic, the schizophrenic, the alcoholic) go to the wall. Many die from lack of care and comfort, usually far more than from fighting, given that Europeans do not currently hate each-other.</span>\n\n<h2>Resilience in short</h2><span>Resilience has four phases: Detect trouble, Avoid trouble, Mitigate trouble and Recover from trouble. I\u2019m writing now about Detecting the upcoming trouble, seeing the signs early enough to (for example) consider leaving likely conflict areas. This is harsh, harsh advice and I\u2019m not simply suggesting picking up and fleeing, but if you\u2019re in a vulnerable group, and you have an EU passport, perhaps now is the time to consider moving north to the extremely well-organized and disciplined countries where Winter can kill you and so people work together and plan to survive it every year, keeping them in good mindsets for handling other kinds of trouble. Minnesota Nice as they say in the US, has nothing on Finnish nice.</span>\n\n<span>So now let\u2019s talk about Mitigate. Go buy some food. Note how long it lasts and how much it costs. Now imagine it costs five times as much, the trucks come once every three weeks, and everything is sold out in days. Now imagine that lasts for years. Ok? So go and buy a lot of food, say two person-years worth. In America that costs about $1500 if you buy in bulk at Sam\u2019s Club and keep some capacity (energy! wood burning stove) to cook from basic supplies like beans and rice and lentils and cooking oil and flour and even wheat (grain mill.) Why? Because if you had these things, and you lived in a fairly safe area, the worst of even extremely large social upheavals (fall of the USSR, American Civil War and even WW2) basically passed you by. It\u2019s the fragility of the supply chain and the grid that draws people into becoming actors in history - you can\u2019t afford to eat, you don\u2019t have a good store of food, you wind up in the black market. Risks go through the roof. Worst still, you enlist in an army to feed your family.</span>\n\n<span>No, I am not kidding. This is the Hard Resilience landscape, and these doors are opening up on all sides. Those people in the streets rioting, the protesting classes, are fighting not for internal political change within their own countries, but (whether they know it or not) for a re-arrangement of the political balance of an entire continent. Conditions are bad enough that the protests could be 10 times the size they are now very quickly, and then escalate to simply becoming the administrative controllers of entire cities. And the new technological base (the internet, 3G masts operated by local groups and so on) can open up the space for these kinds of friendly (or otherwise) insurrections in ways nobody can imagine. Where\u2019s the food, where are the medicines, how do we keep things going.</span>\n\n<h2>Endgame</h2><span>In May of 2012, the Greeks are starving in their homes, as we discuss whether to lend them more money, kick them out of the Euro, or buy the country out from under them. They\u2019re already facing this, and if the price of getting out of that hole is seizing the foreign-owned assets of their own soil, somebody will eventually do it, and then being the question of sanctions and embargos and, well, both Spain and Italy are radically unstable right now, as is the UK but for very different reasons, and slowly we begin to see that this is not somebody else\u2019s business, but eventually, in all probability, ours.</span>\n\n<span>It will be many years before we get to Recover.</span>\n\n<span>Resilience is just about staying alive when the structures you rely on go away. It\u2019s started in the poorer countries in Europe and we are (rightly) panicked. But to understand this in is global context, think of what\u2019s happening in Africa right now - unsafe coal mines, aids epidemic, high food prices, crop failures, starvation, wars of genocidal hatred and the rest blight an otherwise perfectly nice continent.</span>\n\n<span>Any of us can fall as low as the lowest level we allow to exist in the world. Time for change.</span>\n\n<a href=\"http://blip.tv/the-hexayurt-project/through-the-looking-glass-an-evening-with-vinay-gupta-5458567\">You can watch a 20 minute primer on State Failure and Resilience here</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://vinay.howtolivewiki.com/blog/other/the-gupta-state-failure-management-archive-a-public-resource-for-hard-times-2636\">You can download a large, useful archive of Resilience resources here</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://files.howtolivewiki.com/Dealing%20in%20Security%20JULY%202010.pdf\">Here is Dealing in Security, a mapping tool to help understand the pipe/wire/truck systems that support us</a> (PDF, small)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-17 16:14:13", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 22:32:06.318094", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3953, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 92.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14581, "user_id": 3339, "topic_id": 478, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>I\u2019m sixteen and I find this concept relatable and useful...</b>\n\nI really enjoyed reading this article and I find familiar to me some\u00a0of your influences (the Tumblr users, I\u2019ll check out the others at some point)!

I ended up working in the field of sustainability education.\u00a0 At the same time I was volunteering with a local charity as a youth worker.\u00a0 It didn't take long for these two areas of work to connect in my head and I knew that what I *really* wanted to do with my life was to research and/or work with young people who are driving change for more sustainable, equitable futures.\u00a0 To do this, I needed to show knowledge and commitment, and this required a new qualification.\u00a0 A degree in Art History just wasn't the right goods.\n\nAnd here's where the challenge lay.\u00a0 I found it rather difficult to find a human geography course (which was what I had established I was looking for) that would take an art historian, even with a couple of years of relevant work experience.\u00a0 I was becoming despondent when I came across an MSc course at University College London (like you, Alberto!) that sounded promising.\u00a0 I went to the open day and outlined my concerns to the course convenor.\u00a0 He reassured me that they took students from a diverse range of backgrounds and encouraged me to apply.\u00a0 Not only that, since money was a real concern for me and I had already been thinking about extending my postgraduate study in the form of a PhD, he suggested I apply for a four-year scholarship.\u00a0\n\nThis was going to require a lot of work.\u00a0 I had to write a detailed PhD proposal on a subject that, sure, I was enthusiastic about, but I felt ill-equipped to construct what I was sure would have to be a detailed and well-argued plan when the whole discipline of geography was a new world to me.\u00a0 Ben, who was then the MSc course convenor, put me in touch with three of his colleagues who he thought would be interested in my work.\u00a0 We emailed back and forth a little as I tentatively put forward my ideas.\u00a0 Over the course of about three months, I spend every bit of spare time I had in libraries, accessing whatever free information I could find on the internet, and trying to think geographical thoughts that would make my proposal even half-credible to the panel that would read it.\u00a0 The UCL staff I had been in touch with were both enthusiastic about my ideas and generous with their own, and I am confident that this made all the difference when I finally submitted the proposal.\u00a0\n\nThe day, a month later, when I was told I had been given one of only two departmental scholarships that year was not one I'll forget.\u00a0 Yes, I'd put in a lot of hard work of my own on that proposal, but that was fed by the enthusiasm and support from people who must have seen something in me.\u00a0 Those allies, at the earliest stages of my transition from lapsed art historian to youth geographer, have gone on to remain the backbone of my work as I move into the final stages of my PhD.\u00a0 And I can't thank them enough.\u00a0\n\nI'm a bit of a believer in karma - what goes around comes around - and, more than that, I really enjoy sharing my experiences and talking about research with anyone who'll listen.\u00a0 So now I try to give as much of my time as I can to other students - undergraduates who are just getting excited about geography, to Master's students on the course I took\u00a0 three years ago (and for which I now provide teaching support) who are thinking about possible research careers of their own.\u00a0\n\nIt won't be long before my next transition - back into the world of work.\u00a0 While I have hopes for what my next job might entail, I know I have to be realistic.\u00a0 But I also know that I have plenty of people that I can reach out to and who will share as much as they can in order to help.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-10 13:17:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.644515", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 893, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28556, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2619, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Hazem</b>\n\nRe website translations: @Gazbee is working on the Arabic translations.

This revolves largely on our culture of using money, the values we attribute to it, and if and how we can avoid all the pitfalls that come in with money ...\n\nWell, as making money could make this communty more sustainable, it has a pragmatic advantage for sure. But it's also a matter of fairness: as we provide something of value for society, it's just fair if it gets valued by society. One way or another. It's not about accumulating wealth or such nonsense, but basic economic exchange: we get what we need and can't do, by providing what we can do better (and others need).\n\nThis value does not have to be money (there's a whole interesting research area of \"economy of the commons\" which a friend of mine is dealing with). But as money is more or less the only major attribution of value that our \"poorly expressive\" capitalist society can come up with, we can go along and say, yea, we'd also accept money.\n\nBut then, let's make this \"a business as it should be\", far from the wealt-accumulation way:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>co-owned (not just with shares that can be re-sold, that kind of meta level just opens up the way for speculation and loss of responsibility; instead, ownership in this cannot be sold)</li>\n\n<li>open checkbook accounting: showing everybody how much money comes in, and where it goes, being open to correction</li>\n\n<li>proper giving-back rules: there's nothing to be said against decent living conditions for those who contribute to an enterprise, but before it gets to becoming \"wealthy\", there have to be rules and ways that allocate the excess resources to where they're of better use in this world ... like helping the still-next generation to incubate their own social enterprises, for example ...</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThis goes pretty much with the spirit of what Petros proposed above:\n\n\"a registered association, being internally structured as a cooperative, with strongly defined statutory goals and the charter allowing business activity to support them.\" [<a href=\"/t/edgeryders-should-we-morph-into-a-social-enterprise/1033/2\">source</a>]\n\nBecause saying \"social enterprise\" does not mean to say \"capitalist social enterprise\", if there's such a thing at all ... . We're just talking about setting up a formal organization, one way or another (and it does not have to be an association to do business the right way ... though I personally also favor aliging the formal structure to some co-op one). So we want a formal structure (because potential clients want it, and we want the whole thing to work so it helps all of us towards reasonable economic standing, based on the services we can provide to surrounding society.\n\nBTW, CouchSurfing screwed up because they were starting to extract money from their users (pushed to by accepting VC capital, implemented with a AirBnB partnership etc. ...). In contrast, Edgeryders has no intention whatsoever to extract money from Edgeryders folks. Which means, if the enterprise made money from contributions of Edgeryders folks, this is where the money should go to.\n\nMaybe another note. Being a social enterprise (which earns money from clients) would be independent from the project hosting facilities provided on edgeryders.eu. People are welcome to host their project here by founding a \"group\", and maybe this could get traction on its own when specializing on social innovation projects \u2013 \"the <a href=\"https://github.com/\">Github</a> or <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/\">SourceForge</a> of social innovation\". On top of that, those people who have their projects here or belong to the community for other reasons, could also contribute to the work for clients that the social enterprise does.

What do [ OpenCarers or Names of Interviewees] have in common?</h2>\n\n<strong><span>Voice over: </span></strong><span>They see a number of trends which together form future we are ill-equipped to deal with.</span><strong><span> </span></strong>For most of humanity's history, care services \u2013 which today we call health and social care \u2013 were provided by communities: family members, friends and neighbours would check on each other to make sure everyone was fine, keep an eye on each other's children or elderly parents, even administer simple medical treatments. Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.\n\nThis new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology. However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain:\n\n<strong>- Trend 1:</strong> the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people\u2026) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not.\n\n<strong>- Trend 2:</strong> many attempts to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.\n\n<strong>- Trend 3:</strong> Privacy and security concerns in the age of ubiquotous connectivity. Increasingly intimate data generated about us and shared beyond our control, or that of the institutions meant to protect our rights.\n\nAnimation: current situations --- current ways of doing things-----&gt; current (negative) futures.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">3. They are also part of a growing community of people figuring out how to build a health and social care system that is safe, accessible, open and participatory.</h2>\n\nWhat if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care? This is what they, and thousands of others are setting out to do.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">4.

Exhibition and Summit\n\n<strong>Voice over</strong> (describing each step of staircase):\n\n<em><strong>Outreach and exchange of experiences: </strong>It all starts with an invitation for you and others around the world to share personal experiences, observations and examples on the challenge topic. You will share stories of individuals and groups who are building alternative alternatives to existing health-or social care, as well as of others whose attempts were frustrated. The purpose of this is to build a shared repository of stories, each one embedding strategies for improving health- and social care. Some will resonate more than others with participants, and that will signal to the community that a grain of truth has been found. Collectively, we will build knowledge about new approaches towards health- and social care. </em>\n\n<em><strong>Collaborative sense making:</strong> Once the the goals of OpenCarers, a range of possible strategies towards them and the obstacles in the way are reasonably clear, the project enters a new phase of (wiki-style) collaborative writing of the OpenCare fund mission and guidelines. This phase links OpenCare stories to the social, economic, political and legal context in which they happen: were they enabled by something in particular? Were they hindered by it? What change in could have made the alternative happen, or happen more successfully? By asking and tentatively answering these kinds of question, participants in the process will build shared knowledge and goals. This strategy ensures that both are firmly grounded in real-life, first-person experiences.</em>\n\n<em><strong>Project Narrative and calls to action: </strong>We collaboratively synthesise the results of our sense making into a narrative structure for OpenCare, that is going to set the scene for our interactions with one another. This includes co-designing a fair social contract and ethical guidelines for members. It also includes defining role structures (for example: participants can register as \u201ctrailblazers\u201d sharing stories or \u201cmentors\u201d that help making sense of it), motivational engines (for example: badges, karma points or other forms of recognition for active users), strategic partnerships, style and aesthetics.</em>\n\n<em><strong>Prototyping and testing: </strong>t.b.d</em>\n\n<em><strong>Prizes: </strong>t.b.d</em>\n\n<em><strong>Exhibition and Summit: \\#lote 6 takes place in September 2017, in Milan.</strong></em>\n\n \n\n<strong>Voice over and text:</strong> To learn more about OpenCare and how you can be a part of it, go to www.opencare.cc or write to community@edgerders.eu\n \n\n<hr>\n\n \n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Interview Questions: </h2>\n\nNeed to be revosed to give us the right material for script above!\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What is your understanding of what OpenCare is - why should your audience care about it? </li>\n\n<li>What will you be exploring/doing in the project- how will you be working? </li>\n\n<li>What activities you will be running - who do you want to get involved and why? </li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2016-02-24 00:06:24", "updated_at": "2018-11-22 21:09:12.824416", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1164, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 56.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1543], "is_private": false}, {"id": 680, "user_id": 3253, "topic_id": 647, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Sometimes I feel like my friends can\u2019t quite take me seriously when I tell them how much art school is stressing me. When I hear myself describe to them what we do in our courses (like dressing up and dancing around cardboard sculptures of alien Christmas trees), I sometimes find it difficult to take myself seriously. However, as most people that work in a creative field would probably tell you, it really is stressful. Being creative is intense. Apart from the financial uncertainty and competitiveness that tend to run in these professions, the work itself is very demanding, mentally and emotionally. It is very easy to become personally invested in a project, some might even call this is a necessity. Because they are so closely intertwined, it is often difficult to separate between the professional and the personal. How does this affect the way we deal with issues of mental and emotional wellbeing in this context?\n\nIn Product Design, we are constantly brought to question our surroundings, our decisions, and most importantly, ourselves. There has been a crisis point in almost any project where this turned into seriously doubting myself and hating all the work I had done. Sometimes, it led to absolute public meltdowns. To me it is a strange and uncomfortable feeling to share such intimate moments with people I work with.\n\nMany of my friends that study creative subjects have told me about similar experiences in their lives, particularly about struggles with insecurity and stress of varying degrees. Are these emotional strains simply an occupational hazard that we as creatives have to accept? Are they something we should embrace, something we actually need to produce meaningful work? There seems to be a romanticized idea of the tragically ailed, mad genius, based on the stories of countless artists like van Gogh or Beethoven that produced some of their best work during periods of Depression or Hypomania. Joshua Walters proposes in his Ted Talk \u2018On being just crazy enough\u2019, that those suffering from mental conditions might just be more sensitive to the world than others and that we can use our \u2018skillness\u2019 to our advantage. Many scientific studies suggest in fact, that there is a link between creativity and mental illness. One theory is that those with strong creative inclination perceive the world with a heightened awareness and tend to be more reflective and ruminate in their thoughts.\n\nFor me, a host of questions and problematics arise out of this. How do these factors influence people in creative fields in reaching out when in distress? At what point does these different pressures stop aiding creativity and start impeding it? What are your thoughts?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-16 14:25:10", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 16:03:41.256912", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 453, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 1037.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10117, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2254, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Anytime next week</b>\n\nonly exception is on the morning of December 10 and evening of december 13.

Mikhail tries to break with common behavior and therefore creates projects that stand by themselves without any support from any organization or institutions.\n\nMikhail began about 8 years ago with his first community-building project called \u2018Zabej\u2019 (which means literally score in Russian, however Mikhail\u2019s message was more \u2018move your ass\u2019). He started this pilot with a team of 2 friends in Minsk, and was set to create an informal football tournament in which a big variety of people would participate. They used the most basic marketing means: 500 leaflets were printed and hung/spread in yards, residence houses, universities and industrial areas \u2013 then they waited for applicants.\n\nThey engaged more then 1000 people from all kids of spheres, ages, and districts in this project and replicated this model in different regions. Mikhail is proud about this particular project as it\u2019s still ongoing and gives a good example of a \u2018new\u2019 approach on how to build communities.

For people who don\u2019t know about Drupal, here is a short introduction: simply put Drupal is used as a tool to create websites. But Drupal can be used for more purposes. According to Mikhail it\u2019s an open source project, a system created to share, distribute, code for everyone, but most importantly it\u2019s a change in behavior. For him the challenge in this particular project lies in getting to know this community and to shift the people involved in this community. \n\nWhile talking with Mikhail I got to know a new terminology called \u2018Copy left ideology\u2019: it is basically an open source that everyone can use and share without feeling guilty about it! As you can imagine this creates great opportunities for the exchange of knowledge, ideas, info and documents. Using this Drupal system is a good way for communities to share knowledge, and in this way develop themselves for mutual good. I don\u2019t know why but I thought immediately about Edgeryders J. Now the activity in Drupal community touches precise projects like open data (nagrady.by), social initiative platform etc. see more: [http://falanster.by/en](http://falanster.by/en)\n\nMikhail\u2019s focus is on copyright barriers for creativity and e-participation tools for different communities (e.g. cyclists\u2019 or people).\n\nWhen I asked Mikhail what his biggest motivation is to create these communities and basically to do what he does everyday, he responded that for him, it is all about identity. For him it is interesting to find out whether a person is able to change something in this world for the better. This approach he applies to gather communities together or changing the way existing communities work.

I'd suggest that you go to the perhaps extreme of printing up t-shirts so that they are clearly identifiable.\n\nAs I recall the advantage for moving the event to a Saturday was that you could start early and hold the outdoor demonstrations in daylight. \u00a0 From our experience at the Grande Opening this sounds like an after lunch start - say 1500. \u00a0How do you foresee structuring the day? \u00a0\n\nThe house would like to limit our exposure to unknown elements and close off the sleeping areas. \u00a0This leaves the public floor available for your demonstrations of streamed teaching and kitchen etc. \u00a0It also means that we'll lift the hygienic constraints on downstairs loo2, if you agree to wash it down afterwards. \u00a0What kind of use of the kitchen have you imagined, and do you still think that a five hour event is long enough?\n\nWelcome to bring the mats by a day or so ahead of time.\n\nThe other disadvantage with your postponement is that it seemingly impinges upon the Virtual KuFung contribution that you have sketched as part of your activities on the 23rd/24th to 'Map Matera \\#1- Piccianello' (as it seems to be now called). \u00a0Getting the club to drag out their mobile mats two weekends after one another seems to risk diluting the force of a public demonstration - they are most welcome but the program is filling up fast and the thematic connection to VA's teaching strategies should be underlined as a major selling point. \u00a0Your offer of using the mats for our children's gathering is something we'd like to take you up upon; rough details in our program are coming together soon we are looking at after school Monday for the child's course in bombe di semi and urban land occupation. \u00a0\n\nFrom the point of view of cohesion in the unMonastery project profile your presence during the market days is of much more value than holding a one-off event to promote the club down in the sassi. \u00a0The media interface available at Piccianello should also provide added value for the club. \u00a0What I understood to be your suggestion of starting the VA three-festival model by coordinating a mobile radio sending from the Piccianello site is also interesting, but please let us know soon. ( Program to be finalised by the weekend.)\n\nThe communication with the University has thrown us for a loop, people can vaguely remember committing to having the soundscape evening at the unMo, but we would have at least mildly protested had it clearly been on the table during our last coordination meeting with them that determined how their seminar elegantly folds into our Piccianello days. \u00a0We do however value our cooperation with them and see the wisdom of putting it in the best space for the musicians. \u00a0It is great that you are taking the lead on this and are in communication with them as to technical specifications. \u00a0However, again the timing is horrendous: we are still intending to have our dress rehearsal for the Picc events that evening and need the media rig out there for at least the house's four presentations. \u00a0We'll have to use your equipment at one end or another.* \u00a0This split will require that the university has to supply front of house people etc.; I'll take this up directly with Silvana tomorrow. \u00a0Can we leave the technical support/lighting and seating rig for the concert up to you?\n\n* I suggest that the equipment that people are most familiar with goes with us to unMo2.\n\nThe other moments that we are slotting in this time frame include hosting up to 15 people for a three day collaborative project development workspace under de Waag, a storytelling workshop, and the descent of the first coder-dojo presence in the house which all fall within our lead-up week, so you can appreciate how fine tuned we'd like everything to be.\n\nBrotherly Love,\n\nBembo\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-07 08:39:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:16.152381", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 901, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6366, "user_id": 3279, "topic_id": 6333, "post_number": 1, "raw": "With modern day communication technology sharing through email, social media and Skype it rarely encourages people to share the evolution of their project.

Let me say that 2 years ago I started spending some time with them, to enquire about their daily challenges, and to shadow some of them (who kindly volunteered) during their daily routines, I had conceived this as any other didactic activity of my university education, excitingly on the field, but not more special\u2026 how wrong could I have been!\n\nLong story short, I had reached out as part of a design thinking exercise, after brainstorming with my colleagues over social and technical literature to find solutions to the challenge of blind people navigation through living environments, \u201csimply\u201d to extract narratives about what we thought their problem to be and, thus, tune our solutions\u2026 We had succeeded obtaining the information we wanted, we had lists of the defeating features of currently existing solutions, descriptions of use cases, but while working on the desired features, something started to emerge for some of us in the team: another narrative had been seeping through our conversations with the blind volunteers, that we did not consider in advance. Most of the blind people we had talked to, despite agreeing to the obstacles imposed by visual impairment, did not consider that a defining condition and were rather cold to any assistive technology they tested or we described. Instead, narratives of empowerment, education, disintermediation, were flowing through most of their replies, even when our conversations were explicitly biased towards solutions\u201d.\n\n \n\nLet this sink for a moment. And remember that the number one challenge of helping another person is falling in love with the solution one wants to offer, losing sight of the <strong>person</strong> in exchange for the <strong>problem</strong>.\n\nSo we asked Irene to recollect her most significant conversation for us:\n\nIL (<strong><em>Irene Lanza</em></strong>): \u201c<em>Good morning Maria<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>, I would like to thank you already for your time\u2026 it is truly precious to me to be able to talk with you\u201d</em>\n\nMBC (<strong><em>Mother of an 11years old blind child</em></strong>): \u201cGood morning Irene. I have heard about you from my friends and fellows from the blind union\u2026 they say you are a very polite and smart girl\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cAww\u2026 how much will they ask me to pay, now? \u2026ahahah\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cahahah\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cDid they also already tell you about what I would like to talk today?\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cvaguely\u2026 apparently, you are working on a new technology to assist blind people in their daily life\u2026?\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cThat is fairly accurate, but luckily they did not spoil our fun by letting you in too many details. In facts, we are working at the proof-of-concept of a wearable device that could analyze the surroundings in real time and feed information about objects, their velocities, and positions to a visually impaired user, to allow him/her moving naturally through a living environment\u2026 our challenge is to allow a blind person to play a football game competitively against people with normal vision\u2026 well, we would still not provide talent though\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cSo, are you thinking of something like those apps on the smartphones?\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cWell, not really\u2026 we would have dedicated hardware, and we would like to collect your opinions about how to design the user interface\u2026 a smartphone app would be a proof-of-concept compared to the kind of product design we are pursuing\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cI don\u2019t like this kind of assistive technology much\u2026 you never know it will let you down. So many factors: the signal may be lost, the battery may go down, the app could crash\u2026 what should I do then?\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cThis is exactly what I am here to listen to\u2026 you see, we will collect all these opinions, and try to prioritize features in our design concept\u2026 so, have you already tried some of those?\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cI am constantly exploring and searching for new tricks and tools that could help Mario, so I often talk about this topic with my friends at the union, and I try some them after reading their reviews or hearing their presentations. Most of them are quite far away from real life, for they are very specialized on single use cases, and they rely on infrastructural investments that in our Country are stagnating for too long already. Mario\u2019s problems extend well beyond walking through an airport or a shopping mall or reading the label on a tomato can. The only tool I really find useful is the reader with vocal synthesis on the smartphone: it works pretty well and it\u2019s so precious to be able to listen to any book when audiobooks are still not the norm\u2026\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cSo could you tell me more about Mario\u2019s experience? What do you think are the most commonplace barriers he experiences when going to school? How does he roam around?\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cHe is training with the stick. Many people dislike it, but it is rather dependable and attracts sufficient attention to ensure that other people will be more cooperative and safely behaved. However everyday life can become very problematic. Architectures are often hiding traps that would surprise for the naivety of those who designed the spaces: you would never imagine the feeling of dread when you have just seen your son missing an unprotected element from a window, protruding out of a wall with its sharp corners\u2026 and the use of the spaces themselves can be even more challenging! Hanging wires, doors opening directly on stairs, elements built in non-shock-resistant glass. Many of these, if you ask me, would be dangerous to any child, but if you factor in the inability to forecast what you are going to meet next\u2026 The risk of bad practices escalates quickly!\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cSo school is not a safe haven for Mario\u2026?\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cNot just that\u2026 most activities are not structured to include children like Mario. Schoolbooks are more difficult to find as eBooks for the vocal synthesizer than others. Even then, many graphics, whether didactic or there for testing purposes, remain inaccessible\u2026 and even the teachers, despite being adorable with Mario, are not informed about methods for inclusive teaching\u2026 For example, my husband is a musician, and he has always tried to exploit musical theory to organize our family games (she mocks for me a couple of games based on recognizing the tones, or what an object at home could be based on analogies of noises). We constantly try to use acoustics as a tool to explain concepts, and risks to our child\u2026\u201d\n\nIL: \u201c\u2026and this, of course, doesn\u2019t happen at school\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cNot even closely. School sometimes becomes a very frustrating experience\u2026 a place of isolation to remind Mario of his diversity. Irene, you are young, you must remember your lectures of geometry, for example\u2026\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cyes, indeed\u2026 mostly graphics are drawn on the blackboard\u2026 I see what you mean\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201ceven our language is geared for the idea that <em>seeing is believing</em>. Mario often tells me that he has seen a schoolmate with a certain outfit or some event that he is going to tell me about\u2026 he does enormously to find his place in society. And my husband and I do our maximum to help him surpass the social barriers: we teach him games that he can play with his friends, we accompany him to familiarize with the places where he will have to interact with his mates, and we drill into him, constantly, how to react to the unexpected, hoping that panic will never prevail. Technology, instead of these half-baked attempts at substituting vision for simple tasks, should take on education\u2026 there is so much more that is lost in our societies when one cannot see than just reading on a can whether it is tomato or green peas, and nurturing those skills that we all have as fellow humans, rather than focusing on what we lack, would be so much more empowering.\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cwhat you say is very inspirational\u2026 so you believe education is the true mean of supporting Mario\u2026 and what is the place of technology in your vision?\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cwe live in a time obsessed with technology, and we forget that it is just a tool. I have not hidden from you, I am not a big supporter of the idea. For example, we use the e-reader with voice synthesizer\u2026 the problem is extremely important, but not mission critical, and so the technical solution makes sense\u2026 I am not sure I would delegate to technology, or to other humans for what is worth it, many other things on a regular base\u2026 what would be the meaning of life, if you give up on the very experiences that make it worth sharing and living? We are social animals, someone more important than me said once\u2026\u201d\n\nIL: \u201cMaria, thank you really for letting me peer into your family life\u2026 and thank you for your kind guidance. I hope that we will be able to live to your expectations, but I can already promise you that we will at least try our best!\u201d\n\nMBC: \u201cIt has been my pleasure Irene, it is so nice to meet a young person trying with enthusiasm to tackle a problem we have to deal and cope with every day. I wish you the best of luck, and I look forward to hearing about your progress!\u201d\n\nWhen Irene went back to the team after this conversation, she was confused, for having just experienced the most confrontational conversation about their project. Irene was moved emotionally for the passion and interest expressed by the mother. An experience that would leave her forever changed and stretched.\n\nWith Irene insisting, a small group of three people from the original team started diverging from the original path of designing a wearable \u201csmall world\u201d navigation system. They started brainstorming wildly about educational concepts.\n\nIndependently from the rest of the team, which opposed the need to bring to completion the academic assignment, they sought a new agreement with their mentor and started optimal thinking at 360\u00ba. Using 3D ultrasound-based haptic interfaces to offer interactive geometry education or simulators for practical tasks that would completely substitute visualization for acoustic and tactile feedbacks? Most of the early ideas were dropped when their mentor, or people not involved in the team that he suggested to talk to, would object other low-tech solutions (e.g.: wooden models for 3D geometry) could deliver almost the same experience, significantly undercutting the complexities of the projects.\n\nIt was during this na\u00efve and intense search, that their mentor showed them a video of a blind person using tongue clicks to echolocate while biking (!!!). The rest, as they say, is history, and we will share with you a few details about the early testing in a next post\u2026 so follow us ;)\n\nThe challenges for the visually impaired are enormous, so immense are the ramifications for those now living without sight, and so exciting is the initiative on the horizon.\n\nTo protect the privacy of individuals the names and identifying details have been changed.  There was a brand indicated, which we discovered is trusted among the blind community, but we do not think it is relevant here.\n\n<div>\n\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\n\n \n\n</div>\n\n \n\n<div id=\"ftn2\">\n\n \n\n</div>\n\n</div>", "created_at": "2017-05-30 09:25:06", "updated_at": "2018-05-09 17:00:06.776423", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2072, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26809, "user_id": 1442, "topic_id": 5523, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>here's my name for video</b>\n\nvery nice shooting and also infovis!\n\nhere's the text:\n\nZoe Romano | co - founder WeMake | Makerspace Fablab\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-20 15:05:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:28.313194", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7481, "user_id": 2196, "topic_id": 3636, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Brilliant</b>\n\nThank you.\n\nRiel\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-18 20:16:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:43.867772", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1015, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 982, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Dear friend old or new, Your help in making this event a meaningful and fun experience for everyone involved is needed and much appreciated.

Looking back, we can spot features that contributed to who we are as individuals, families, communities, nations, and a species. History, quite literally, has made us.\n\nMy love for the past goes back as far as I can remember. But it was as a teenager that I really caught 'the bug'. I spent years working as an actor and swordsman at Renaissance festivals throughout New England. I spent my summers portraying Elizabethan courtiers, knights errant, and even some of literature's most famous swashbuckling heroes. While this was a great source of fun throughout my teenage and university years, it also awakened in me a rather unexpected realisation. Although I was dressed in a suit of armour or a sumptuous doublet, and although I was portraying certain cultural features that nowadays we would consider quite archaic or alien, the actual people themselves, their personalities and motivations, were fundamentally no different from you or I. This understanding has inspired the way in which I teach others about History to this day.\n\nHaving completed a BA and an MA, both with a particular focus on History, I found my way into the museum and heritage sector. One of my interests being early arms and armour, I worked for five years at the Royal Armouries Museum, Britain's national museum of arms and armour. This career took me from its museum in Leeds finally to a curatorship at H.M. Tower of London. To spend my days working at a site that has witnessed almost 1000 years of history, be it good or ill, was an experience that will stay with me forever. Yet throughout all of this, the same realisation shone brightly through: the people who lived and worked on this site, and who used and made the objects I cared for, revealed themselves to still be so very familiar.\n\nAll of this is largely back story, for it is when I came to London that the part of my journey with which we are concerned with here truly began. Over the past two years, I made the acquaintance of several individuals who in their own ways are working with governments and other organisations to try to make the world a better place. Two such individuals of particular note are Vinay Gupta (of the Hexayurt Project and The Future We Deserve) and Dougald Hine (of The Institute for Collapsonomics and The Dark Mountain Project). These two do a lot of work on the present and possible future decline of our societies and ways of life. They look not only at what is happening, but also at what needs to change if we are to avoid or at least cushion the blow of the worst possible future scenarios. Looking around you, it is easy to see that such work is fast becoming relevant.\n\nAlthough I was fascinated with the work they were doing, I felt that, as an academic and historian, there was little I could personally lend to their efforts. I was disabused of this notion over an extended period of time by a series of unexpected events. I would frequently join them at meetings and discussions, less as a formal participant and more as a hanger-on who was going to the pub with them after things had wrapped up. With my intentions always being to sit back and listen, given that the subject matter was usually something with which I had little to no experience myself, I nonetheless found myself leaning forward at least once or twice and remarking on some idea or comment with something like 'If you're looking for useful precedents for that idea, perhaps you should look into this or that group from the 12<sup>th</sup> century who were doing the same thing.' or 'The last time that strategy was attempted was in the 1890s, and it didn't work then either. So since little of the important factors have changed since then, it's likely to fail again today for much the same reasons.' Insights or understandings of the way in which past events were connected to present circumstances or have an impact on future ones that seemed obvious to me were often regarded as previously unknown yet useful data for others around the table. After this happened enough times, I was told in no uncertain terms that I needed to take these ideas and do something with them.\n\nAnd thus, one year ago, Applied History was born.\n\nIt seems such a simple concept, using knowledge of the past to understand present circumstances and to guide future decisions. But all through my life I have been frustrated and amazed by the ways in which allegedly educated people, occupying decision-making positions in government, business, and similar organisations, seem to be making the same mistakes as did our ancestors. It is guided by that famous saying, 'Those who are ignorant of the past are doomed to repeat it.' While this statement is practically a clich\u00e9 nowadays, it nonetheless holds true.\n\nHistorians have been the caretakers of 10,000 years of data on various answers to human problems. Some of this is no longer relevant to us, but much of it still is.

I think this is a sort of sign for the maturity of an industry/cultural sector. It has generated a secondary field of employment, complete with organizations representing various stakeholders, which should be capable of reasoning, reflection, and somewhat long term planning. The I gave some numbers to get across the enormous reach and impact these cultural phenomena have.\n\nThis is important because video games are of course not a unambiguous blessing. Established cultural institutions typically perceive them as competition or malign influence. Both is probably true. However this is not set in stone but can be influenced if one is willing to engage with important actors on eye-level. Making games is cool - but it is also very difficult, and compared to so called \"mods\", much more frustrating.\n\nA little after 4:20 he goes into the different incentives to play various games. In this one success is relatively strongly tied to coordination with other team members - so despite the superficial looks it promotes pro-social behavior, planning, and taking the other side's perspective. Digital games are very well suited for experimenting with such dynamics and finding systems that can promote people into roles they would otherwise not likely get into in real life. And also training how to cope with \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad#In_the_workplace\">dark triad</a> situations\" without risk of bodily harm.\n\nThe next video is basically a record of an improvised (theatre) play that was performed by perhaps a dozen or two players. They each adhered to a certain given role and tried not to act \"out of character\", while being entertaining of course. It will be a little bit hard to follow given all the slang and game-related dialogue. The game itself is a modification of one of the most realistic military simulations publicly available. I expect thousands of (unpayed) man-hours must have gone into changing the environment from a nondescript battlefield into a \"lived in\" vibrant place chock full of cultural artifacts and references. How often do you get a 27 minute improvised play with a dozen amateurs get viewed over two million times?\n\nAnd if you look at bohemia interactive you'll see that one doesn't need to have a big budget to crash the party. There is <em>a lot</em> of passion in the gamer community that practically begs to be carefully and respectfully channeled.\n\nIn the Goatz video the modding community takes a stab at itself. A little background: due to various factors (perhaps including a broader range of information) a subgroup of the younger generation feels that large parts of society are either not conscious of what they are doing (popularity of zombie/apocalypse culture) or that there is a deep immoral parasitic streak in society (vampire culture). Accordingly many games are either modded to reflect that \"flavor\", or somewhat amateurish but passionate and ambitious games of this genre are developed from scratch. Usually though both have certain unfixed problems (bugs) that the players have learned to live with. Goatz is basically an effort to capture much of these cultural currents and idiosyncrasies in the format of a satirical game, that will be extremely entertaining to a cultural insider. By the way: modding a game will usually leverage the considerable enthusiasm of the kids to make it possible for them to learn using highly complex design software - which is a very much transferable skill into many other cultural activities. Honestly, I would appreciate a detailed meta-level analysis of why this has not yet happened on a large scale.\n\nThe next video is a mod that is taking a stab at patronizing and unimaginative attempts to curb video game violence. Something the gaming community is all too familiar with. Again I think there is much sociological potential in this situation if one turns the tables on this.\n\nThe last video is hopefully self explanatory. I think the process illustrated in it is relatively representative. Also, it is not surprising that the commenter has a Swedish accent, if I may give in to generalization in this point. Although \"gamification\" as a term has started to be used, I think the criticism leveled at it is (already) in many respects fair. It seems to me that the creative potential digital gaming community, and many of the opportunities for genuinely constructive contributions to general has eluded mainstream cultural actors for more than a decade now. Sadly, by now my impression is that this is not by chance - but it has something to do with the center / edge dynamic often encountered on this platform. That is also why I raised the point, in hopes of finding a relatively open ear.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a horse in the race on either side - but I know backgrounds and actors of both, which make me grit my teeth more than I want to. I'll try to get some more clarity on the general issue in <a href=\"/t/draft-new-book-on-networked-collaboration/4516/8\">another thread</a>.

Collaborating on the web led us naturally to decentralization. People were holding many conversations at the same time. Some of these conversations led to action. <strong>The rule that emerged was this: whoever wanted action was responsible for taking the first step and leading</strong>. We ended up drawing legitimacy from action, and that made us a do-ocracy. A mantra started to circulate:\n\n<em>Who does the work calls the shots.</em>\n\nIt turned out that organisations wanted to work with us. The only way to do this was for us to build a company on top of the online community, that could act as interface. So <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-as-social-enterprise-what-you-can-do-with-it/1044\">we did</a>. \n\nWe thought we could it without changing our way of working. In fact, we very badly did not want to change it. This is how we did it: someone from our community had experience in business and finance. We asked them to be the \"money guy\".  They would keep track of legals and finance. We let them choose the jurisdiction they were most comfortable with (they chose the UK) and asked them to incorporate. We saw the legalities and procedures involved with running a company as boxes to tick, and we had just ticked them. Then we went back to work.\n\nMistake.\n\n<strong>Companies were never meant to be do-ocracies</strong>. They evolved out of pacts between traders, who joined forces to finance and organize a caravan to some distant land. These pacts were meant to protect the interests of those entering them. This means that they need to have a conservative bias. Who can do what is staked out with great care. If you are not explicitly empowered to do or know something, you are, by default, forbidden to. \n\nServices to companies are built around that bias. Accountants and banks will only talk to credentialed representatives of the company. Access to company data is out of the question for everybody else. Result: anyone wants to do anything around a company, they have to ask the few people (or even the only person) who are credentialed to take action.\n\n<strong>This leaves most companies with a \"centralization by default\" position</strong>. Edgeryders was no exception. All our corporate services (Companies House, the accountant, the bank) were going through the same one \"money guy\". The only way to have decentralised management in spite of all this was for this person to accept its whole burden. They would have needed to provide timely, transparent updates on what was going on. They did not do it, and in fairness it was not a nice job to have. \n\nThis led to a lack of transparency and the consequent inability of an information-starved board to make decisions. Frustration translated into conflict. It got quite ugly. We paid a heavy price, and it serves us right for not paying attention. The \"money guy\" refused to hand over company records and was finally expelled from Edgeryders LBG. Some money was unaccounted for. We suffered the humiliation of reporting our missing records to the tax authority and the police. We had to kick the person out of the Edgeryders company. We then needed to rebuild them starting from banking data \u2013 excruciatingly boring work. \n\n<strong>We also needed a better solution to run things</strong>. A year later, I think we have one, made up of several components. My heart goes out to the many people out there who helped us pull through such difficult times, and pointed us towards some of those components ( @ivan was especially helpful). In the rest of this post I introduce and discuss them. \n\n<h3>Principles</h3>\n\nThe following principles are \"portable\" to almost any organisation wishing to run in a decentralized way.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Use the cloud</strong>. Internet access to business data and services enables decentralized work practices. Everyone can query them for the information she needs, whenever she needs it. Everyone gets the same picture, so there is less potential for misunderstandings. We use online banking, accounting, social media management, CRM, and of course our own platform to discuss things. Everything we can put online is online. </li>\n\n<li><strong>Keep it simple</strong>. Solutions are worth nothing if people do not use them properly. We tend to go for barebones ones, simple enough for us to stick with them.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Share responsibility</strong>. If you assign a key function to any one person, you break decentralization, because that person can no longer be routed around. We rotate roles, so that people gain the ability to stand in for each other. This is especially true of anything related to money. If you are an entrepreneur, you have to take responsibility for the business side of what you do. There is no \"money guy\". You and your partners are it.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Don't cut corners</strong>. Regulation on companies is there for a reason. Resist the temptation to treat it as a series of boxes to tick. Doing things right has huge advantages for transparency and accountability. We do this by keeping wikis on management practices: how to account for operations, how to authorize payments etc. In a sense, wikis and documentation replace management: they are algorithms, and anyone who enacts them is managing.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Write</strong>. The written word functions as a record of your activities. Get into the habit of making short written updates on what you are doing, and share them in the company's workspace. This buys you autonomy: if you are transparent about what you are doing, you take away the need for other to monitor you in case you are up to something potentially damaging. Also, writing allows your colleagues to choose their own level of involvement in what you are doing. This is important, because it pushes out to them the responsibility for intervening if they don't like it. You write \"I'm going to do X\". No one objects, so you do it. If then someone comes back complaining after the fact, you can point to your post and say \"hey, this has been here for a month. You have had your chance to intervene.\" At the same time, of course, you must be honest and not drown your colleagues in a sea of information.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Specific solutions</h3>\n\nWe adopted the following solutions. No pretense of portability here; some are only available to UK companies, others are home made and exclusive to Edgeryders.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>E-government: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_House\">Companies House</a></strong>. The UK's registrar of companies allows you to manage your company's records entirely online.  Do yourself a favor and keep those records up-to-date. </li>\n\n<li><strong>Accounting: <a href=\"http://www.freeagent.com/\">FreeAgent</a></strong>. A sophisticated accounting cloud service (browser-based). You import your bank's transactions (via APIs), then do all your accounting on it. You can (and should) create many users, with different levels of access. I like the social implication of using it: it implies you do your own accounting. Someone must be able to explain each and every movement of money. You end up knowing your business well! And, with this low-level work done, you can generate sophisticated reports, do ratio analysis and so on. Only 20 years ago you needed to be a bank to have this kind of stuff! The only down side is that there is no way to give read-only access to people. If you can see something, you can change it.   </li>\n\n<li><strong>Accountant: <a href=\"http://www.nimblejackaccounting.co.uk/\">Nimble Jack Accounting</a></strong>. After the \"money guy\" fiasco, we signed up with a London company called Nimble Jack. They have a brilliant business model: they live in symbiosis with FreeAgent. All their clients get an account in the basic package. This makes their work extra efficient, because the clients do all the low-level work of entering bills, invoices, and banking data. If you decide you want to use NJA too, please tell them Edgeryders sent you (we get a discount).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Banking</strong>. This is an unsolved problem. If you are a small, global company doing most of your business overseas (and in EUR or USD), UK banking frankly sucks. It is expensive and the level of service is dismal. We are functional, just about. If you know of a half-decent bank in the UK, or, even better, a bank anywhere that offers competitive banking in EUR to a British company, please tell us about it! The only silver lining; most have APIs that FreeAgent can link to. </li>\n\n<li><strong>Super simple CRM: edgeryders.eu</strong>. We tried a Drupal-based CRM called RedHen, but it did not work for us. Way overkill. So, Matthias built a simple content type called Journal, with variables that can be updated via comment. The principle is the same we use for <a href=\"/taskmanager\">Tasks</a> (think Issues in GitHub). Each Edgeryders project becomes a journal. Initially they are in the idea stage. As they progress, we leave comments saying \"such and such happened today\" and change their status to \"negotiating\" or \"live\" or \"finished\" or whatever. Take a journal and go through its comments: as you do, will also follow the related project through its cycle. If you want this for your own project on Edgeryders, you can have it. </li>\n\n<li><strong>Forum: edgeryders.eu</strong> <strong>again</strong>. A specific, invitation-only <a href=\"/t/about-the-administration-er-lbg-category/335\">project</a> on edgeryders.eu is the conversation hub for Edgeryders-the-company. Yes, we discuss business mainly in writing. This is great for decentralization, because two people can start exploring a topic. If they need to involve others, that's easy: their conversation thread acts as a record and a recap for the new people. </li>\n\n</ol>\n\nAt the end of the day, these are just standard pieces. They are not the reason why Edgeryders is a decentralized environment. <strong>We are decentralized because we choose to be, and we are ready to pay the price.</strong> We pay it gladly, because such are our values, and because it enables parallel processing and, as a result, far higher productivity. And we need any edge we can get to survive as a social enterprise. \n\nBut we need to stick with that choice, and renew it often. Organisations seem to flow towards centralisation like water flows downhill. <strong>Every time you don't make the effort to share a piece of information, you are hoarding knowledge and power</strong>. Perhaps it's true, as Loki once said, that <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_3CZExnn8MI\">hierarchy is our natural state</a>.\n\nWhat about you and your organisation? What's your experience? Is there anything we can learn from you? \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/_3CZExnn8MI?rel=0\n\n<em>Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/92981898@N04/14107309468/in/photolist-nuBDBA-mKdwti-nT5mTp-nPfhQb-cb2mh5-r2EWWQ-aCARcU-dGzHe1-f3qaki-mV6a6H-b4tzUg-oAWR93-9imqSx-pzEme9-9J4z4x-nrehKG-oREPY7-fn8j6P-dg6u52-9uxn1R-9zdC2m-A1YZUL-p8hQ5N-6CtD1r-mpPgS4-9Pxhwh-avi4Lf-qTmmCt-dkSNox-oHbkzp-e9szyE-cQtVhm-fHNQxu-srnLNP-d93cJG-8DWyLh-nCvpWt-nT5kWz-nXqmQc-aBcfsM-doBWBU-nUVyXq-yd6bj-bywwZT-7W83ne-oVcWuE-pGkcK2-bjWVjT-cAYKxY-bAQ6Tp\">Smitty</a></em>", "created_at": "2016-04-25 16:40:00", "updated_at": "2018-07-28 08:20:55.477007", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1935, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 151.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 2551, 3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29592, "user_id": 29, "topic_id": 1951, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>hashtag</b>\n\nwe decided for \\#unmon\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-17 08:46:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:42.914313", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 9, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [29206], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14688, "user_id": 61, "topic_id": 3460, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>LOTE Track Record:  The Demon Drink </b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span><span><b>On last Thursday's collective planning session I was encouraged by Alberto and Noemi to post my comments on the Edgeryder drinking culture as it reflects upon our effectiveness as Stewards.\n\nHere they are....</b></span></span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>The Edge we Ryde explores survival strategy. \u00a0Its primary concern has always been social cohesion. \u00a0\n\nThe resources invested by ER to gather our brains imply a social contract that we are to provide access to our brains at their perkiest:</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Three Case Histories:</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Strasbourg '12</span><span> -- Numerous Edgeryders find the historic towpath and local beer store, police come. \u00a0Significant percentage (30%?) of our number march in two hours late next morning missing the\u00a0</span></span><span>well-chosen ritual welcome for downsizing rhetoric.</span><span>session hosted by our local organisers. \u00a0Embarassing.</span>\n\n<span>Brussels</span><span> '12-- Edgeryders purportedly launch a drinking contest between among others Iceland and Russia: results inconclusive. \u00a0No established correlation between this occurrence and an ill-flavoured argument with venue host. \u00a0Significant percentage (writer guilty as charged, although more a transit issue with tram \\#5) of participants exhibit diminished levels of creative listening the next day. \u00a0Shame, shame.</span>\n\n<span><span>Matera \u201913</span><span> -- Lively use of the town\u2019s short distance wine industry and charming piazza life \u00a0beckon. \u00a0Key cultural event slides off program largely unnoticed;

The overarching logic behind this development and acquisition is generally to enable the provision of public services. In recent decades this model has become overstretched: states have found themselves struggling to find the resources to keep those assets manned so that provision of such services could continue, and had to retreat from many non-core services. Consequently, many such assets lie unused; some are beginning to deteriorate.\n\nIn an effort to correct this situation, some public assets have been turned over to the private sector. This move has had mixed results: while some financial advantages for states have indeed materialized, at least in the short term, many privatization programs suffer unintended consequences. The general consensus seems to be that it might be interesting to explore new avenues.\n\nCommunities have been singled out as candidates for taking care of some public assets, in particular those that can be used to provide services to the community itself.\n\nThere is now evidence available to indicate that communities can indeed provide stewardship. The EdgeRyders community has itself accumulated significant experience in this area. We believe the ability to come together to take care of assets in an unstable context is a key skill for surviving and thriving in the future.</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\n<h1>#LOTE4</h1>\n\n<h2>Stewardship</h2>\n\n<span>23-26 October, 2014\n\nMatera, Italy</span>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\n<img alt=\"image\" height=\"auto\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c30764cf0b50d5ade8cbb307c725a7f625e0d8e5.jpg' width=\"280px\">\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>Detailed program is under construction below.</td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n \n\n<span>Location: <a href=\"http://www.creativespot.be/spots/BAF\">Brussels Art Factory, SMARTBE</a></span>\n\nUnless plenaries are specified, all sessions will take place in parallel to each other (see table columns above) in rooms that will be designated and signaled on location.\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:15pt;\">\n\n<table style=\"border:none;border-collapse:collapse; width:80%\">\n\n<colgroup>\n\n<col width=\"10%\">\n\n<col width=\"35%\">\n\n<col width=\"35%\">\n\n</colgroup>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;background-color:#333333;padding:7px\"><span>THURSDAY 25/02</span></td>\n\n<td style=\"border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;background-color:#333333;padding:7px\"><span>LOTE5 KICK OFF!</span></td>\n\n<td style=\"border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;background-color:#333333;padding:7px\"> </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px\">16.00-17.00</td>\n\n<td colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-left:solid \\#000000 1px;border-right:solid \\#000000 1px;border-bottom:solid \\#000000 1px;border-top:solid \\#000000 1px;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px\">Participants arrive and get to know the SMARTBE building.

I really don't know much about business models.\u00a0My impression is that advertising-based business models are only viable for\u00a0very very large numbers of users, especially now that there are powerful incumbents.\u00a0You can buy Facebook advertising with as litte as 20 EUR.\n\nBy implication, these services tend to be bleeding out money for several years before they can break even. They have to make a nice service to be attractive, because they never can start making money\u00a0unless they have attracted user first. How to survive this period of structural unprofitability? Venture capital. But then VCs own the ship, and they get to have last word on where it goes. All of the \"change the world stuff\" will have to be deprioritized.\u00a0\n\nSo, though I can easily imagine a well-meaning social network running some kind of ethical advertising model, I have a hard time figuring out one that survives in the red long enough to get there, without becoming completely unrecognizable in the process (with the usual ousting of the mythical founder, filling the board with Silicon Valley lawyers etc.).\u00a0Is your business plan public? How many users do you figure\u00a0you need to be viable?\u00a0\n\nAs for Edgeryders, we have decided that being scalable is a bad idea, because scalable business models are going to be automated in the not-so-long run. It will be robots all the way down. Instead, we sell consultancy: this is the ultimate bespoke service, hard and not really profitable to farm out to AI.\u00a0In principle, we would love to stand on the technical infrastructure of someone else, like Topishare; in practice, this would be an unacceptable risk. My first open government project, Kublai, ran on Ning, the closest forerunner of Topishare I can think of; but Ning changed several times terms of service on us. This brought home how badly you become pwned by the providers of your tech infrastructure.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>In 2010, in a surprise move, they stopped supporting the open source, downloadable versions of their platform. They also killed all migration tools, effectively locking us in the SaaS. They also did not answer to clients' frantic emails. Surprise, surprise: this was connected with their 2008-2009 VC funding round (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ning_(website)). It led to the ousting of the CEO and founder\u00a0Gina Bianchini, as tycoon Marc Andreesen moved new management in.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>We reacted the way we could: subscribing to the paid version. But at that point, we were completely owned by them. Advertisers wanted \"playful\" features (\"give a gift to your friends!\"), which were completely at odds with our serious government agency attitude. \"The Ning\", that had been our main home base, became a burden. My successors ended up building a bespoke platform based on Wordpress. Not as cool, but finally under control. By then, the project was dead in the water. Not entirely Ning's fault, but sure they did not help. Not that it was personal; for them, we were just another community. They claimed one million such communities was running on Ning's infrastructure. Why would they care about us?</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2016-06-07 13:46:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:56.728418", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 558, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26552, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4576, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Thank you @trythis for your comment. So all the activists are freed and the protesters kept the avenue blocked yesterday morning thanks to the human chain made by some politicians and famous figures in order to protect the crowd. \n\nI've heard that the \"police\" in plain clothes were actually body guards of some of the members of the government thus their unorganized and unlawful actions towards the peacefully demonstrating crowd on June 23. The reason they started the water cannon and arrests was that the people were still blocking the avenue by 5AM and it was against the law as all the protests must be approved by the government and this one was of course not. Also there is a law forbidding noise after 11PM so that's when the police warned the protesters that they need to go home and they refused to do so. The main objective of the police was to clear the street for the morning traffic but their actions were not justified.\n\nThe sit in was completely peaceful and the protesters did not do any vilent action and they were indeed caught by surprise by the water cannons and the police actions. There was a large panic as even though people left the street , they were still chased by the police and dragged to the police vans violently (lots of friends had bruises, broken bones and torn clothes) and some injured protesters got medical assistance only after several hours in the police stations. \n\nThe police officers have strict orders NOT to support the protesters thus we can not count on them for any help. Any interaction with them is met with dead silence and is ignored.\n\nThe other problem is that Russian oriented media presents the protest as something similar to the uprising in Georgia and Ukraine WHICH IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL and this causes a lot of confusion for people who are not participating. Just to clarify: <strong>the protest has no political context</strong>, no anti- Russian or pro western movement is organized: just internal business(people protesting against the decision of the government to raise the electricity rates). No political issues are raised: just business sector's issues. \n\nOf course, there are some people that would shout slogans like \"Serj go away!\" but it's only a minority and those are the people who have some affiliations with other political groups. The majority of people as I have already mentioned have no political affiliations and demand reconsideration of the decision about the electricity rates.\n\n@Alberto The people demand data transparency, and accountability and refuse to pay for the debts of the badly managed ENA which belongs to Russia. See more details <a href=\"http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/27077441.html\">here</a>. There is a popular <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/729029347222560/\">facebook campaign </a>urging people to turn off electricity every day from 19:00 to 00:00 suggesting that even if you turn off for 3 hours per day during a month, the government will beg us to use their electricity. It is already clear that no hike of rates will happen(they say the president will speak up today or tomorrow) but we are also asking for the head of the police who is to blame for the violent clean up on June 23 be fired and a criminal case against him and his team is opened.\n\nAnd yes, I've noticed some posters about alternative energy in the crowd. :slight_smile:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9b237c8292e691da137d6ebdc7477560cc02f3fe.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\">", "created_at": "2015-06-25 10:41:28", "updated_at": "2017-09-24 21:40:27.807267", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 601, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26300, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1675, "post_number": 26, "raw": "<b>Food, Health and Open technologies</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-family: Arial, 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; color: rgb(115, 99, 87); background-image: initial; background-color: white; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; \">\n\n<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" color=\"#000000\">What do \u00a0a group of art university graduates in Stockholm, HONF and Tim Ferriss have in Common?</font>\n\n</div><div>Mixology is an\u00a0eating event where participants engage in playful research into food combinations.

There is a lot of indigenous knowledge about the effects of different foods on our physical and mental health that could be captured and doing something like this at the Edgestation or UNMonastery or whatever we decide to call it in the end would enable me to do this in an open way and participatory way.

It's just an experiment - Edgeryders is really designed for asynchronous interaction - but it should be fun. If you want to join, this is your last chance to <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/its-almost-edgeryders/\">subscribe</a> and join the team of testers! Our development team is restricting the maximum number of participants in this phase, but we still have a dozen places left (of course, once we go live there will be no such restriction and anybody will be able to join). By taking part in beta testing you get to access the platform, become a registered user and get to play the first of the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaigns-missions/\" title=\"Campaigns and missions\">Edgeryders campaigns</a> before anyone else.

Carlo, Daniele and Ivan, our development team, will be watching closely but probably not interacting a lot (too busy monitoring the newborn platform's performance).

Ho scelto la ricerca socio economica e in particolare\u00a0il monitoraggio e la valutazione come ambito di approfondimento che mi ha accompagnato fino ad oggi nella maggior parte delle esperienze professionali che ho fatto fino ad ora. Ho sempre lavorato da allora, senza mai un giorno di pausa, n\u00e8 momenti di disoccupazione, ma la sensazione che avevo all'inizio e che non riesco ancora oggi a scrollarmi di dosso \u00e8 quella della mancanza\u00a0 cronica di opportunit\u00e0.

They had a crisis: an enormous earthquake which killed 300,000 people, about 3% of their population. Then the international community stepped in, raised billions of dollars to help, and nearly two years after the earthquake, around <strong>800,000 people are still homeless</strong>. There is a pile of money, and yet the people sit on the streets or in cholera-ridden encampments, wondering why nobody helped them. Thousands of dollars per family sit in relief bank accounts, unspent. They have protests, asking for the money, but it was raised on their behalf by agencies which hold it in trust, and have no effective way to spend it. The crisis continues.

The same set of forces which left the people of Haiti homeless and bereft, while funds raised to help them sit unspent repeats at many other levels of complexity, creating the global paralysis we are all trapped in. Once you understand, in your bones, that what is happening in Haiti is real, and much the same kinds of actors (governments, charities, the international community, the UN, the military) are attempting to solve the financial crisis and the environmental crisis, with about the same degree of success, the whole thing becomes much, much clearer.</div><div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; line-height: normal; font-size: small; \">\u00a0</div><div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; line-height: normal; font-size: small; \">What they have done, in failing the people of Haiti, is what they are doing to all of us on climate. Once you understand that it is much the same actors, in a much, much more complex and higher-stakes game, the full weight and presence of the situation can land. There are only two choices: face the situation, that <strong>our global governance systems are failing to safeguard our futures</strong>, and try to solve the real problem, or fail to face the situation, and risk standing on the deck with a rag in your hand polishing the brass on a handrail, the other end of which is plunging into the vasty deep as Spaceship Earth sinks below the waves.

One thing I took from Jamais Cascio's talk on climate geoengineering at Hub Westminster was very simple:<strong> \"desperate people do desperate things\"</strong> and a scenario that he described which involved warming, then fixes, then fixes for the problems or failure of the fixes and total nonlinear chaos as everybody scrambled to fix the climate seemed entirely plausible.

And that ain't gonna happen while our primary energy generation technology is coal and oil. Our alternatives, solar and wind, get trivial amounts of government investment, and aren't profitable on huge scales in the marketplace without government subsidy because BLUNTLY it's a whole lot easier to burn oil than to capture the sun. That's just how it is, right now, until we fix the technology and it's been \"two years out\" for quite a few years. The miracle may be just around the corner, but it's as tough as ever to do the research, and the sheer capital requirements of transforming the global energy economy, even with the panel technology, never mind the political ructions caused by the abrupt end of the age of oil<strong> leave us looking at a hard path</strong>, even with the miracle in the bag, and it's not there yet. \u00a0Energy efficiency has been just-a-bit more profitable than energy waste for decades, and getting people to move even a\u00a0centimetre\u00a0in that direction works about as well as stamping out AIDS with only condoms. Without a technology breakthrough like protease inhibitors, a theoretically perfectly-effective policy measure does almost nothing.

The same muppets which left 800,000 Haitians on the street with billions in the bank to help them and told us that everything possible had been done are exactly the same class of muppets that we're counting on to save us from climate change and oncoming nanobiotechnology risk. What's happening in Kyoto, Cancun, Copenhagen and Durban is just the same thing that happened in Haiti:<strong> the responsible parties from the international level have completely dropped the ball</strong>, and reported it as the best possible outcome.

Focused specifically on two core ideas; <strong>The unMonasterians Kit</strong> and <strong>How unMonasterians Sleep?</strong> (a heated topic).\n\n<strong>The structure and contents goes something like this: </strong>\n\nGuide Line Specifications\n\nThe unMonasterian Kit\n\n'Needs' that define the requirements of the Kit\n\n-Sleep\n\n-Hygiene and Cleanliness\n\n-Eating\n\n-Interface with Community\n\n-Connectivity\n\n-Work\n\n-Hospitality\n\n-Wellbeing\n\n-Growing\n\nThe relationship between the unRule and the design of unMonastery\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h1>Guide Line Specifications:</h1>\n\n<strong>Where possible all design elements should be:</strong>\n\nCollapsable / Rearrangeable / Moveable\n\nFoster and Facilitates Communication\n\nMinimise Decoration (No Decoration)\n\nHackable / Modifiable\n\nMulti-Purpose / Multi-Use\n\nSourced Locally\n\nCarbon Neutral\n\nLow Cost\n\n<strong>Specific Issues to Matera that require design solutions:</strong>\n\nHumidity\n\nand... ?\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h1>'Needs' that define the requirements of the Kit</h1>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2>Sleep</h2>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2>Hygiene and Cleanliness</h2>\n\nNo brainer \u2013 also the experiment at LOTE3 went reasonably well. The main point of contention concerned the appropriateness of having a dishwasher (some perceive it as superfluous, or even dysfunctional as it breaks the edgyness of unMonastic life). There was no discussion on having a washing machine.\n\n<h2>Eating</h2>\n\n<h2>Interface with Community</h2>\n\n<h2>Connectivity</h2>\n\n<h2>Work</h2>\n\nThere was surprisingly little discussion about worktools. There seems to be consensus that people will have permament workspaces, available round the clock. [Leo] pointed out that workstations need to be personal too, but he might have been thinking of his particular work as a technologist, as opposed to, say, a herbal garden.\n\n<h2>Hospitality</h2>\n\n<h2>Wellbeing</h2>\n\n<h2>Growing</h2>\n\n<h1>Previous Post Below</h1>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h1><strong>How will we sleep?\u00a0</strong></h1>\n\nIf you view the popplet below you'll see due to certain conditions of the building, it's necessary that we have sleeping quarters on the top floor of the building - however we've yet to establish how this will work. Two suggestions have been put forward so far, firstly, we should have rollmats or some form of modular bed system, so to allow for all spaces to be transformable, rather than fixed.\u00a0\n\nThe second suggestion was that the unMonasterians sleep in the community rather than in the building, this is tricky due to the funding agreements the model is based on - however it might be a way of significantly increasing the capacity of the unMonastery project, 10 inside the building, 10 in the community - on rotation.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Things to consider:\u00a0</strong>\n\n-How will we achieve privacy? Does privacy exist in the unMonastery?\u00a0\n\n-How might sleeping arrangements within Matera lead to better integration?\u00a0\n\n-What kind of bed/structure should be used for rest?\u00a0\n\n-Which rooms should be bedrooms?\n\n<span>-What else?\u00a0</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h1>The unMonasterians Kit - What's in it?\u00a0</h1>\n\nWe agreed with MIMERS that the easiest way to think about the furniture, equipment and design requirements of the unMonastery is through the consideratin of a kit for each unMonasterian. This should take into account an array of different elements that we've discussed over the past couple of days - including: Furniture for each unMonasterian (Bed, Table, Stool, etc?), Uniform or outfit?, Tech (Tools for doing things like Open Street Map on a rolling basis) and what else?\u00a0\n\n<strong>Questions to answer:\u00a0</strong>\n\n-What's in the kit exactly?\u00a0\n\n-If this kit includes items of furniture, what is the brief for these items? (Each item should be easy to modify, easy to repair, collapsoable, modular, multi-use)\n\n-What are the key pieces of tech kit that should be added?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Orange = Actionables / Next Steps</strong>\n\n<strong>More information : </strong><a href=\"http://landes-immo.com/\">http://landes-immo.com/</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-03 10:34:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:11.341102", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 760, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22235, "user_id": 100, "topic_id": 1243, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Philosophe de profession</b>\n\nAlberto, je suis pay\u00e9 pour agir en tant que philosophe, \u00e0 partir de mes propres recherches, d\u00e9couvertes philosophiques, dans diff\u00e9rentes domaines comme la strat\u00e9gie d'entreprise, la conception de produits de e-learning, l'innovation ou la formation de commerciaux. Il existe en France une organisation qui se nomme le Centre des Jeunes Dirigeants (CJD). Cette organisation a des repr\u00e9sentations locales et, pour l'une d'entre elles, le CJD de Lyon, j'ai men\u00e9 pendant deux ans un Caf\u00e9 philosophique. L'objectif de ce Caf\u00e9 philosophique a \u00e9t\u00e9 de former des dirigeants \u00e0 utiliser un outil philosophique, la probl\u00e9matisation, pour agir en tant que dirigeant.\n\nCela veut dire que dans mon m\u00e9tier de philosophe, je ne travaille pas en citant Platon, Aristote ou St Thomas d'Aquin ou des philosophes plus actuels qu'ils soient fran\u00e7ais, anglo-saxons, italiens, allemands (je ne connais pas du tout la philosophie actuelle espagnole par exemple). Ces auteurs constituent \u00a0ou non \"ma cuisine\", je dialogue ou non avec eux (je dialogue avec Deleuze, Derrida au travers de leurs livres et directement avec Fran\u00e7ois Laruelle, Anne-Fran\u00e7oise Schmid).\u00a0\n\nMon domaine de recherche est l'Esth\u00e9tique (en tant que science exp\u00e9rimentale) et mon objet de recherche est l'innovation. Ma vis\u00e9e en tant que philosophe est de d\u00e9couvrir encore plus de l'humain que ce qui est actuellement pr\u00e9sent de lui. Je n'ignore ni les sciences cognitives, ni la neurologie, ni la psychologie, mais je ne m'en sers pas pour jusitifier, valider mes travaux et je ne pose pas mes travaux comme science ultime de toutes ces sciences. Je dis juste qu'il existe des mani\u00e8res de conna\u00eetre l'humain, de l'explorer, de le comprendre et, en retour de le donner \u00e0 voir, qui est la philosophie exp\u00e9rimentale (ou, pour \u00eatre proche de Fran\u00e7ois Laruelle, la non-philosophie).\n\nMes recherches apparaissent sous forme de textes \"abstraits\" (non publi\u00e9s pour l'instant), de textes d'application comme celui fait pour le Grand Lyon\u00a0\n\nhttp://www.millenaire3.com/Affichage-de-la-ressource.122+M5f7d50fe1af.0.html\n\nd'objets comme des quelques produits dits de design, des produits e-learning de formation (ou une m\u00e9thodologie pour les construire) et du conseil. Ce sont des applications de mes recherches.\n\nUne autre forme d'application que j'ai utilis\u00e9e cette ann\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 de publier en direct dans un site \u00e9lectronique des textes courts qui semblaient \u00eatre des opinions sur la situation politique internationale, europ\u00e9enne ou fran\u00e7aise. Or ces textes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 construits \u00e0 partir des diff\u00e9rents points de vue d'un acteur dans l'un de mes mod\u00e8les (la Sc\u00e8ne esth\u00e9tique). On voit alors qu'un discours apparemment pertinent se forme ind\u00e9pendamment des connaissances sur un sujet donn\u00e9.\n\nUne autre s\u00e9rie \u00e9lectronique (Clinique strat\u00e9gique) utilise un autre mod\u00e8le, le C\u00f4ne, pour \u00e9tudier \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 qui est le meilleur strat\u00e9giste parmi les personnages politiques fran\u00e7ais. Les r\u00e9sultats rel\u00e8vent du mod\u00e8le non de mon opinion ou de ma croyance.\n\nVoil\u00e0 Alberto. Est-ce que \u00e7a r\u00e9pond \u00e0 ta question? Certains me payent pour profiter de mes recherches philosophiques et de leurs applications. Donc je n'apporte jamais le point de vue du philosophe mais ce que la philosophie exp\u00e9rimentale permet de faire.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-05 12:05:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:03.856577", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 562, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 351, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 318, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2013-08-11 14:19:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-12 18:11:54.923368", "deleted_at": "2017-07-25 14:06:02.905799", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3146, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 3113, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2014-06-05 14:55:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:17.449442", "deleted_at": "2017-09-19 15:09:59.163029", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4878, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4845, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Actionables</h2>\n\n<strong>TITLE</strong>: Of the format \"Living On The Edge 5 \u2013&lt;TITLE&gt;\".

But United Nation Resident Coordinator <a href=\"http://undp.by/en/undp/rr/\">Sanaka Samarasinha</a> and his collaborators had the vision, and the vision was right.\n\nSanaka and I discussed it first over a year ago, at a UNDP innovation retreat on the shores of Montenegro. I listened, fascinated: Belarus has a highly centralized governance style, as far from the Edgeryders way as possible. It seemed like a terrible fit. On the other hand, many young Belarusians are inventive and passionate, and they get amazing results in conditions that can be far more difficult than those of their Western European counterparts; UNDP had got a foot in the door of citizen participation with the <a href=\"http://data.myworld2015.org/\">MyWorld survey</a>, that had almost 9,000 participants in Belarus (and over five million worldwide!). And even sections of the government seemed willing to engage and learn.\u00a0\n\nAnd so we took a deep breath and dove in. We did a prototype \u2013 what else? Lightweight and cheap, with a barebones team made of open hardware hacker Vinay <a href=\"/u/hexayurt\">@hexayurt</a>\u00a0Gupta, Belarusian-Dutch social entrepreneur <a href=\"/u/masha_cheriakova\">@masha_cheriakova</a>\u00a0and myself, we went in in August 2014. We got to meet inspiring, brave young Belarusians like <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-from-belarus-social-innovator-lesya-pchelka-no-thank-you-kalilaska/3534\">Lesya</a>, <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-from-belarus-social-innovator-ludmila-skradal-her-mission-an-inclusive-belarus/3571\">Ludmila</a>, <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-from-belarus-social-innovator-mikhail-volchek-a-community-builder/3736\">Mikhail</a>, <a href=\"/t/blog-social-innovator-from-belarus-aliaksei-parasiatsyeu-develops-curiosity-for-belarusian-cities/3771\">Aliaksei</a>, <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-from-belarus-yauheni-klishevich-talaka/3850\">Yauheni</a> and many others.\u00a0\n\nAnd we got lucky: UNDP brokered a deal with the Research Institute of the Ministry of the Economy. They are helping to build a policy document called the National strategy for sustainable development, which has a very broad scope and includes things like inclusion of people with disabilities and social innovation. The deal goes like this: if UNDP drives it, they are ready to welcome a civil society position paper as a contribution to the National strategy.\n\nBelarusian civil society is not used to this kind of interaction with its government. For many reasons (many Belarusians have mentioned to me their country's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Belarus\">tormented history</a>: it lost a quarter of its population and practically all of its \u00e9lite during World War II), equal-standing partnerships between the civil society and the government are very rare indeed. We thought we could facilitate the process a little bit by organizing a workshop in Minsk, under the aegis of UNDP, where the position paper would be drafted.\u00a0\n\nThe workshop is today. Apparently we have a full house.

Perhaps part of this is because traditionally a career in education avoided many of the uncertainties you would have to face if you \"went out into the world\". So it often attracted these kinds of people (notably among others).\n\nOf course this does not apply across the board. Big groups are rarely as monolithic as they look. But in general I would go in with Ton's assessment. Of course @Alberto has a point too, particularly for sub-currents that may make up most of the edge. They may vehemently want to distance themselves from the mainstream. Generally though I believe operative the term is \"(semi) consensus democracy\". Basically, you only move when everyone agrees. Or when there's only a few shrill voices left, ignoring which won't cost you much authority (in case they were right after all). That way you avoid making punishable mistakes. There are certain circumstances (and levels of authority) where the system can switch into another dynamic though. E.g. reunification, Fukushima*, and now the refugee situation. Usually this is when there is consensus that there is no consensus - and waiting for it to arrive would very probably be very bad.\n\nI believe at such a time the normal channels become much less relevant and the effective deciding bodies smaller, and less restricted by convention.

LANGUAGE OF COMMONS. I love to repeat myself, like an old gramophone, that 'we are all in the same boat'. For me, the language of commons is about RESPONSIBILITY.\u00a0\n\n<u>I am responsible for the way I think.</u> I adopt good mental habits.\n\n<u>I am responsible for how I feel.</u> Anxiety, OUT! Bad temper, OUT! Fear, anger, OUT of my life! I don't want to obsess over risks. I don't want to worry about the future, or believe there is no hope. '<em>Foi, esp\u00e9rance et amour, mais l'amour est le plus grand'</em>. - I Corinthiens 13\n\n<u>I am responsible for how I perceive the world.</u> Max Planck: '<em>When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at will change</em>'. Shift your perception, and reality will shit too. The more expanded your sense of self, the more possibilities are released. I try to face every problem.\n\n<u>I am responsible for my relationships.</u> Of course there are two sides in a relationship. I can only be responsible for my own part. I don't wait for other people to change things. Otherwise, I would be pretty disappointed and might end up waiting forever. Otherwise, I would feel dead inside and my live would have no purpose. I try not to impose past relationships on present ones. I try to make people feel enhanced, encouraged, appreciated. Of course, I'm not perfect, I don't always succeed in doing this at every second of my life, but I make efforts, I try to shine light on people as much as possible. I am generous in giving, rather than in taking.\u00a0\n\n<u>I am responsible for my role in society.</u> I understand the power of social contagion. I understand the power of my own individual empowerment. I applaud people, when they raise their individual empowerment (I don't get jealous or scared by them). I know that positive influences have their own infectiousness and far-reaching effects, beyond what my humble brain can imagine. Wherever I go, I try to make a positive, detailed contribution. I always talk about my highest ideals. I hang out with people much more brilliant and evolved than I am... and I don't care if I might look stupid or say stuff less brilliant than they say. They help me grow, and I am grateful to them. I keep very close in touch with the people that matter to me, and they know that I care about them.\n\n<u>I am responsible for my immediate environment</u>. I know that it does not matter if I just sit quietly and say nothing. My influence vill still be powerful. Most people I meet in person do not know about my real identity, and it makes me smile. I know that the projection of my self is total, and it does not matter if people do not see me for who I am. I just Am. I make efforts to better understand this: '<em>We seldom take pains to correct the common error that it is not we who dwell in the universe, but universe dwells in us</em>.' (Gopi Krishna) I try to stay open for every avenue of information and opportunities.\n\n<u>I am responsible for my speech.</u> Words have an effect on others. Because I take responsibility for my speech, I go beyond its content, I allow for its additional dimensions. I let people read into me, by being open and transparent. Yes, it makes me vulnerable, but people can read in me all kinds of things, beyond my control. Their impressions of me are their own creations. Therefore, I try to shine my light as fully as I can. I am consistent in how I speak. I am not afraid of talking about my experience, even if I know that it might be unusual, or that people might not understand. Speech is supposed to be the window of the soul. I try to have as big a window as possible! This is a hard one for me, because I'm an introvert, and I could be happy by just keeping shut. Social media helps me speaking out, and allows me to find a balance between just saying 'yes' and 'no' (which is my natural trend) and making my voice heard. I know that am growing and making progress, and this encourages me to speak out ever more.\n\n<u>I am responsible for my body and my life</u>. I realized a long time ago that my body is not just a machine made of flesh and blood. It has a soul. I am linked to consciousness with my body (with what else could I be linked?). Every cell of my body thinks, and is connected to everything else. My brain is not just located in my brain, but in my whole body, and probably beyond. I see that my body is a consciousness that has a material form. I am conscious that I am in a physical state of consciousness. I know that my behavior, my thoughts, contribute to raise the consciousness level of my community. Day after day, I want to live in greater truth, I want more. There is a great thirst that pushes me to be more.\n\n<strong>OK, to sum it up, I tell myself that am responsible for EVERYTHING. This way, I truly and deeply CARE FOR COMMONS. </strong>\n\n3. The fight for water... the fight for breathing fresh air, the fight for protecting trees and beautiful forests, women rights, the fight to stop abuse, the end of war, the fight for global peace, making efforts toward a more balanced economy, respecting diversity, celebrating healthy bodies (end of disease), appreciating clean cities, spreading beauty, wishing happiness for everyone, you name it, bring on the causes! I want this world to feel like we are living in Heaven. I would like everyone to be stuck with bliss, and reach a perennial state of happiness, that leads to a modified perception of reality.\n\n4. Critical consurism campaign. I prefer to propose concrete solutions to replace critical consurism by another model, another way of thinking and living.

We have people sharing their experiences making something for themselves or their loved ones (like Night Scout), but we also have people talking about their organizations and the people who are benefitting from them (like Orange House), which is still a step removed from, for example, getting stories from refugees themselves. Yet I wouldn't consider this any less of a personal experience. Similarly, students who have been given formal exercises to formulate their ideas, to me, are also valuable community members whose stories of creating technologies to deliver care are also important. From reading their posts, their contributions fit into the framework ---- presenting a problem, offering a solution. Then community members on Edgeryders interacting with them to ask for more information, make connections, etc. The important thing, from my perspective (and as @Alberto points out) is for them to stick around and respond to the comments. The value of sharing stories is to understand a) what kind of problems around care people are picking up on and addressing and b) how others react to their approach --- do they share similar problems, are they problematising the way that they are approaching it and offering other solutions, do they think the questions need to be reframed, etc. These reactions can take place on the platform (this is ideal) or in the actual world (still good, but we need a way of documenting this, as you point out @Moushira ).\n\nIt depends on what we are interested in. If we are trying, as @Alberto is, to map networks of people talking to one another, it is not entirely ideal to have someone reporting someone else's experience. If, though, we are going for a repository of knowledge and ideas, it doesn't matter so much.\n\nOnce we get to talking on a more macro level about the purpose each of the posts serve (much like we are doing now) we get into slightly different terrain. This is higher-level analytical work we are doing (for example, @Moushira , the content of your comment). I am trying to group these kinds of discussions under a \"methodology\" tag.\u00a0\n\nHere would be my ideal:\u00a0\n\n1) Tell stories in the first person as much as possible. To capture information, we need people writing on the platform itself rather than linking to information elsewhere. So, as the students are doing, writing about their projects.\n\n2) If someone has commented or interacted with you in the actual world, in my view it would be most helpful to record those in comments below the post. We are still thinking through how to do this, but creating dummy accounts would be a way of capturing interactions. Alternatively, if this is too difficult, it is okay to put it in the body of the post itself--- we will capture the content (knowledge, ideas, reactions) but we will lose the interactive node element.\u00a0\n\n3) non-stories are fine too --- analysis is really important, especially for writing reports, generating new and innovative methodologies, and making sense of data. We can gather these kinds of conversations and use them to make higher-level decisions about the project itself, what the data means, etc. I can still capture this information through codes and hierarchies.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-12 23:27:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:10.949571", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 632, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13563, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4070, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Hi Ben,\n\n<s>Two general points before I go into </s>detailed responses below. Last point first.\n\n1. \"Maybe I'm being overly sensitive but there seems to be no acknowledgement of this recent <a href=\"/t/notes-from-the-lote4-session-on-the-future-of-care-in-the-hands-of-hackers/3920/3\">comment</a>, combined with the fact that last month you completely cut me out of a potential collaboration which Annemarie put on the table via email on the grounds of 'diversity'. What gives?\"\n\n-\u00a0 I asked to have a separate call with Annemarie to explore potential for building two upcoming EU funding calls. Before we even get into any discussions about <em>content</em>, we need to figure out if we can <em>build the conditions to be able to participate</em> (lots of EU requirements, need to find leading partner with specific administrative capacity and experiences etc) as a partner organisation. I really have a hard time following her especially when other UK based people are in the \"room\": there will be a lot of implicit assumptions, references to things that are new/foreign to others, etc so in order to really understand what is going on I prefer one on one conversations (see forwarded email). We are still looking for possible lead partner, so I've been exploring how to step up efforts to find them.\n\n- This concept note was produced after a conversation with a person called Stefano Maffei at Politechnico in Milan in which he explained that in order to engage prospective lead partners we ought to present a couple of themes that the community is exploring. If they see a match with their current areas of interest then it is more likely that the people we reach out to will make an effort to get their organisations on board.\n\n2. \"I'm saying this now because I think it's important to be clear about this - and because I have observed this as a worrying trend in EdgeRyders (i.e Case Study Adventures going into other contracts/offers is awkward, given that I and others designed and ran that project with my/our own funds, time and since then have received zero remuneration from the LOTE4 budget).\"\n\n-\u00a0This is important to me. Please specify exactly what you mean here, can you give examples? To the best of my knowledge the Case Study Adventures have been referenced (although a conversation is still ongoing about how, if at all to make use of them) within the context of the same Rockefeller Grant that made funding travel, accommodations, food etc for LOTE4 available of which you were well aware that I was pursuing.\n\n- The Rockefeller grant is for developing the Open Ethnographer free software and even this is going back into the community in the form of paid tasks that anyone can claim and submit (more info <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer/578\">here</a>). Only a small chunk of it was for LOTE4, but this is what we could get (they weren't up for funding an event, only parts of it as part of the work of developing the software).\n\n- Lauren Lapidge, Maria Byck and yourself have been offered reimbursement for travel costs incurred during the case study adventures from the money left once all the invoices agreed on in advance were paid. To be clear, no one else except for I think Natalia (she moved to Matera and worked full time for two months) has been renumerated for the time put into building a great event. That we would all be working on volunteer basis was explicit from the beginning, or am I missing something?\n\n3. \"Nadia, the HackCare manifesto, HackCare the phrase and the concept of Hacker Care homes, these are all things that I have been working on for the past 6 months to a year, with a diverse group of people (that happen not to be on the ER platform), I decided to run a session on this at LOTE4 with Remy because I thought it would be interesting and that there would be a lot of overlap with conversations that we've had in the community in the past years. I didn't do this because I wanted this to instantly become an EdgeRyders project. Especially given that in the UK I have been in discussion with possible partners and funders over the past few months.\"\n\n- Yes. This is also a conversation many others have been having for years and in many different fora. Almost two years ago Susanne and I made this visualisation that was used for <a href=\"/en/edgeryders-at-31c3\">discussions during \\#31C3</a>, my own home is a prototype in response to the need for inter-generational living spaces and I am currently looking for a space to scale up the prototype in Brussels. Your reaction gives rise to some questions for me: How do you relate to everyone who contributes to the work on open platforms- are they not \"co-authors\"? Do they not have shared ownership of the ideas and concepts they participate in developing? How about those who help create conditions/setting for those discussions to happen? Even if people have in our/your opinion contributed nothing to a context or conversation, I don't know how you would go about enforcing ownership of names etc without breaking community and open collaboration.\n\n4. \"Whilst I generally don't take issue or make claims of ownership, I find this post, and re-appropriation of the research material that comes from a very considerable amount of work, with zero interaction with myself (putting it mildly) quite offensive.\"\n\n-\u00a0 Help me understand what it is you find offensive?\u00a0 The explicit purpose of LOTE4 on Stewardship that we worked on <em>together</em> was to generate more opportunities for more people to work on things that matter. You would explore options in your directions and contexts,\u00a0 others explore them elsewhere. This is how the event was built, it is how resources were surfaced for unMonastery, for LOTE4 and many future things to happen: which in themselves are the result of very considerable work put in over a couple of years now. The purpose of a closed group is that we can post strategies, ideas, proposals and documents etc to be discussed <em>before</em> they go public, and you are in this closed group, so I am a bit confused about the zero interaction part...\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-02 12:05:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:16.687585", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1108, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7185], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20712, "user_id": 128, "topic_id": 1657, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Some thoughts</b>\n\nThanks for pointing out these points, it's a pretty tough exercice, but i'll try to suggest some answers or some clues to all of them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>1.How can we encourage people through the door, or do we need to?</strong>\n\nI don't think we need to to encourage people to participate in politics. As you mentionned, not many people want to be involved in it. It's not about lack of information, and i don't see how we could encourage them to participate in this.\n\nBut i think a lot individuals have a pretty good idea about what's going well and what's going wrong in some fields they are involved in. Building a tool to allow them to express that could be an alternate approach and would allow, with semantic analysis, to have an understanding on the reality of each domain.\n\nEach individual can talk about their life and work conditions, but can't tell what would be best for everyone.\n\n<strong>2.</strong><strong>How do we ensure that the people who are participating are representative of the population as a whole ?</strong>\n\nI think it's impossible. The world became so complicated it seems impossible for an individual one or a small group to represent the population as a whole. Individual needs can be so different and often be opposite, it seems really complicated to see it as a whole.\n\nPeople can participate in their specific fields of interest and represent a part of the population, but i don't see how they could represent the population as a whole. Participating people could represent global considerations : what's better for mankind, but it doesn't take into consideration a part of the population which is more interested in personal fulfilment and self-realisation. So it doesn't really represent the population as a whole.\n\n<strong>3.</strong><strong>Can we create a democratic environment that allows issues to be considered at the right level, and speaks human rather than organisation?</strong>\n\n<strong>\u200b</strong>It's not only possible, we need to. But i'd prefer to talk about an environment, tools to allow that. As i already argued, democraty is about people, but it's also about power of a few, decisions made by a few. Even if they are not corrupted byt this power and are looking for the common good and try their best, they can't take human decisions, but organisational and global ones.\n\nAn other approach could be to let concerned people communicate with each others to find solutions at different scales : local, regional and global.\n\nFood production could be a good exemple. There are some measures and european laws that just destroyed some particular productions. These decisions have been made for the interest of the most by taking into consideration health and hygiene issues, but it didn't take into account some really specific local productions which had to adapt or die. It lead to many local dramas because some farmers don't have the financial possibility to adapt to some european requirements, even if they don't put anyone in danger. Moreover, some products are so specific they just can't adapt to these global laws.\n\n<strong>4.How can we make public services an active ally rather than a passive barrier in democratisation?</strong>\n\nBy simplifying it and changing the goals public services have in mind. <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/help-build-june-conference/mission_case/funding-20-edgecamp-session-dear-funders-letter\">The dear funders letter</a> and the discussion about it point loads of relevant issues about getting help from public services.\n\nI can share a personal experience about it. Lately i wanted to find an old and abandonned house to make it live again by renovating it with eco-responsabile goals in mind with some friends. We searched about every public financial helps and we realised that you can get help from public services if only you pay professionals to restore and renovate a building.\n\nThe goals of such policy are obvious : promoting local companies, making sure the work done will match with building rules and help the economical circuit grow.\n\nWe realised that, sadly, you need a lot of money to get help from public services in this particular domain (but i think it's the same elsewhere), and if you want to do it without their help, you need a lot of money as well.\n\nPublic services are too involved in actual economics considerations and it doesn't help moneyless people who are capable and have a strong willing to build things.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>5.</strong><strong>How can we support an informed and fact-based democracy, rather than a shouting competition that favours those with time and money?</strong>\n\nThere are a few things that could help :\n\n- no more politics on televisions. Seems radical ? The format of this media isn't good for politics as it encourages shouting competitions. Last presidential elections in france have been considered by a lot of people as a bad and silly joke. The campaign was mostly about individual fights. Programs and ideas were not really discussed, it was \u00a0more looking like a puppet show or childish fights. It's because of the media : television is about entertainment because of advertisments, and litlle by little, it has deeply changed politics.\n\nA good reading about this phenomenon is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death\">Amusing ourselves to death written</a> nearly 30 years ago by Neil Postman.\n\n- getting back politics to the lower level : local issues and individual needs.\n\nWe need tools for that, and a lot them already exist or are being designed. There are so many of them, it's fascinating. As i can't make yet an exhaustive list, i can tell my actual contributions : i'm actually trying to design a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OLzyVmNhwAU3E9-TSt7zFiUARSDh3pOetugUc7hFQ0w/edit\">serious game</a> which has various objectives. Another possible tool is <a href=\"http://demopolitique.com/\">demopolitique</a>, which was designed to let anyone take part of a collaborative discussion about societal issues. And we need a lot more tools to understand what are local, regional and global needs and problems and to sort things out. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web\">Semantic web</a> approaches are a relevant way to have a better understanding of what politics (as the affairs of the city) need to be.\n\nThe more various and different approaches and tools we can get, the more people will find a way to contribute to politics and the more politics will be close to reality.\n\n<strong>6.</strong><strong>How can we ensure that democracy and participation online isn't crushed by Facebook or an authoritarian regime?</strong>\n\nAs someone said at the we, the people session : we don't need a facebook of democracy, we need an internet of democracy.\n\nA <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web\">semantic web</a> linking all the different websites and approaches would allow to have a decentralised, free of forms, internet of democraty.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-05 08:51:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:55.295444", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1262, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18297, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4499, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>That sounds like a good call</b>\n\nI know it will appeal to <a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>, who likes to \"do it right\".\u00a0<img alt=\"smiley\" height=\"23\" src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png\" title=\"smiley\" width=\"23\">\n\nMatt, what do you think?

We exploit the property of\u00a0open\u00a0interaction to weed\u00a0out errors and personal biases; this effect gives rise to\u00a0Wikipedia's famous <a href=\"http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~fviegas/papers/history_flow.pdf\">self-correcting properties</a>.\u00a0\n\nOver the years, we keep being awestruck by the power of result-oriented conversations as a knowledge engine. People will turn a problem in their head, make conjectures, explore them, use each conjecture to quickly generate alternative ones and explore\u00a0<em>them</em>\u00a0too, look for supporting evidence to reference, try small experiments, involve others. They are unafraid of\u00a0exploring\u00a0poorly defined questions, if they are interesting enough (\"how can we defeat the tyranny of the mortgage?\"); in fact, they can help define it, and even\u00a0turn the original question on its head (\"what you are <em>really</em> asking is XYZ\"). It's uncanny.\n\nHere's the problem: on the Internet (and in a friendly-but-tough, result-oriented social environment like Edgeryders)\u00a0an open conversation very quickly becomes too large to keep in any individual human head. Since inception, we have needed ways to summarize\u00a0the point of view not of individuals, but of the community in conversation, and to do it in a scientifically sound, accountable way.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Hence, ethnography</strong>. Ethnographers have the\u00a0appropriate tools for the job. Just as importantly,\u00a0they have the right research ethos for Edgeryders: ethnography's definitional attribute is \"no research\u00a0<em>on</em>\u00a0a group without encoding the point of view\u00a0<em>of\u00a0</em>the group\". This encodes a healthy degree of respect for the community trying to solve a problem, or to address a research question. We like that. Too many researchers have an extractive attitude towards \"the crowd\", seen as a rightless volunteer in collective intelligence exercises.\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/t/welcome/5345\">OpenCare</a>, too, has found its ethnographer. <strong>I am proud to announce that <a href=\"https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/hasso008\">Amelia Hassoun</a> will be working with us on this\u00a0project</strong>.

A general point is that we\u00a0need to know precisely how any graph was built if we are to interpret the result with rigour. As Fernando Vega-Redondo likes to say, \"when you talk about networks, you have to specify what a link is\". So, I would like to know more of how we compute this DOI index.\n\nA more general point is: I am not sure we should even have thread-level views. What can we learn from one such?\u00a0\n\nLet's assume the best-case scenario: we look at a single thread that has\u00a0<em>all</em>\u00a0the co-occurrences that appear in the conversation-level co-occurrences graph. We can reasonably imagine we could use this highly representative thread as an entry point to the whole conversation. We could read the post and its comments, and immerse ourselves in a meaningful subset of\u00a0primary data.\u00a0\n\nAnd yet, that would be far from the whole story. We are on a quest for\u00a0<em>collective</em>\u00a0intelligence. A co-occurrence in our imaginary \"golden thread\" is only important ex-post, because it also co-occurs elsewhere in the conversation. If it did not, it could just as easily be the quirk of some participant to the thread. Also, the single-thread co-occurrence graph would be flat; we would not be able to arrange co-occurrences in a hierarchy, and so tell the most salient ones from the rest.\n\nFor example, in the Open Insulin post (see above) there are exactly zero pairs of codes that co-occur more than once. Of course each contribution with n codes induce an n-clique of codes co-occurring on that contribution, but that's it. I tried to explore a few more threads. For example, this is @Alex_Levene 's first <a href=\"/t/welcome-to-the-jungle-weve-got-fun-and-games/625\">Jungle post</a>:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9b888f086af9eb71f5e35e0bc9c77b21c07949ad.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"440\">\n\nHere, we actually have one real co-occurrence: <code class=\"content-output\">self-sufficient refugee camps</code> and <code class=\"content-output\">volunteer labour</code> co-occur twice, once in the post itself and the other in <a href=\"/t/welcome-to-the-jungle-weve-got-fun-and-games/625/5\">one of its\u00a0comments</a>.\u00a0\n\nYou get the idea. I think there is not much point in having graph views on single threads. There is not much point. If it were up to me, I would simply delete the tab, and focus on building\u00a0views that help analysts look for the signature of collective intelligence. \"Collective\" is the operative word: it means the data have to come from the whole conversation.\u00a0\n\nStill, I see a potential\u00a0application for the work behind the view. If we can compute indices that represent \"richness\", \"coherence\", \"interest\" and the like, we can use them to recommend a point of entry into the conversation. Suppose I come to an already coded opencare conversation. I am interested in data in medicine. I discover a code called <code class=\"content-output\">medical data</code>. This is what I am interested in! At this point, I could get a list of threads that are associated with that code, with their richness/interest/innovation/whatever score. This would save me time by letting me zero in onto the most relevant content associated with my area of interest. The score could just be added to the list view:\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dbf4ceea8709eea80d7e203ba5cf5c18172e2117.jpg\" width=\"408\" height=\"500\">\n\nWhat do other analysts think? @Noemi | @Amelia | @Federico_Monaco\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-28 10:55:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:00.713627", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 650, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19655], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23310, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6448, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>The time factor and how it plays out</b>\n\nI think @Nadia and @Hazem are very right to highlight the time factor.\u00a0\n\nThe way I see it: for the WB project, we need some quick, easy win to show. Remember the unMonastery crowd's reluctance to commit to results within the duration of the prototype, insisting the time frame was unrealistic. This rules agriculture right out: by definition, it follows the rythm\u00a0of the seasons. Most crops need a minimum of one year. If you are looking at olive orchards, you are going to need twenty.\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, Tarfaya or some other out-of-the-way place has advantages for the WB-funded\u00a0prototype, some of which others have already pointed out. If the unMonastery experience is anything to go by, a Reef in Tarfaya will be highly conspicuous \u2013 maybe even too conspiscuous, but that's a good problem to have. However, out-of-the-way locations are hard to reach for people in the region, and sometimes even in the country, as Hazem points out.\u00a0\n\nBUT if we are looking at an ER long-term investment, the case for cities (real cities, @matthias , not 50K inhabitants towns) becomes much stronger. If we are to invest, we need sustainability, and we need it <i>right away</i>, because we do not want to go into debt. For now, the only proven source of revenue in the region is consulting on development issues. I am persuaded that having a presence in the region might be an advantage,\u00a0allowing us to get more contracts than we do now. Also, it could become a template for future expansion:\u00a0we could spawn a Reef hosting Edgeryders West Africa, Edgeryders SouthEast Asia or whatever. But in this case, we would need to climb the learning curve of getting these contracts, and I am afraid that calls for being close to clients and donors. Also, we need a place where we can ourselves go quite quickly and cheaply as needed.\u00a0In Morocco, that means to a first approximation Rabat (but Casablanca is close enough that you can get away with it). As you get established, you can probably get away with relocation, but in the early days the economics of a space far from sources of money are the economics of fixed costs and burnthrough rates. That's quite risky.\u00a0\n\nSo, here's a suggestion: maybe decide if we are prioritising doing a great prototype now, and\u00a0<em>then</em>\u00a0maybe we'll make a permanent investment. In this case we are more free to pick locations, because the prototype is already funded. On the other hand, if we insist that the location of the prototype be ready to stabilise, then we need to be conservative and prioritise the ease of making sales \u2013 which is\u00a0the hardest bit of the ER experience.\u00a0\n\nIn all cases, the idea of crowdsourcing locations is great.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-10 10:45:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.461318", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 515, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 19.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23098], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24491, "user_id": 115, "topic_id": 2953, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>lets start with</b>\n\nan ad that takes people to the Tbilisi conference call to action?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-17 17:09:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:15.717867", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18336, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3296, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Oh yes also </b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/lasindias\">@Grupo Cooperativo de las Indias</a>\u00a0too...\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-19 17:59:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:42.401267", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17432], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17712, "user_id": 3385, "topic_id": 694, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>That's the first (strange) word Nadia uttered: SHWASHLOCK!</b>\n\nI mean Nadia El-Immam, of course.

The first phase consisted of trainings on female health care and maternal health, trainings for trainers as well as refreshers, questionnaires and medical checkups and support.\n\nIn the course of the pilot 100 women have been involved - those who were open and interested in participating, and could serve as community leaders.\n\nThe outcomes have been promising - Swekshya could already see how women became more independent and aware of various health issues and conditions. The educational campaign has also brought results and women replied more accurately to questions regarding their health and hygiene. Even more, after such a short period the results of repeated basic examinations: eye, dental, blood pressure, health of pregnant women have already improved comparing to those in the first phase.\n\nSwekshya is now collaborating with Development Vision for Nepal, a non governmental organisation that is planning to extend this pilot by bringing it to other areas and introducing it to local doctors. They plan to implement a financing model same as the famous eye doctor from Nepal uses to provide free cataract surgeries to poor Nepali; by charging regular amount those who can afford it, and finance from the Collective pocket help for the poor patients\u2019 examinations. And as I imagined the easy and affordable access to medicine in Nepal must be of great help here, it turns out the prices are still widely prohibitive for many. Swekshya is already working on fixing this aspect as well by collaborating with pharmaceutical companies directly and using their donations.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-09 08:45:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:34.835444", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 402, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 80.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 325, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 292, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Test Description.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-29 12:08:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:00.156030", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1611, "user_id": 665, "topic_id": 1578, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"imagecache-Featured\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/imagecache/Featured/hangleton_social_media_map.jpg\" title=\"\">\n\nThis mission report is on a pilot project called We Live Here, which is running in two areas of Brighton, UK.\u00a0\n\nWe've tried to create a civic space by networking the networks that already exist in the community. Our idea is that people won't come to portal sites, and they already trust and feel comfortable in their existing networks. Rather than setting up single conversations, or debating sites (where only the few interested in debate will go), we wanted to strengthen the existing network, make it's reach wider, and use it for democratic conversations.\n\nHere's what we did:\n\n1. Used an interative mapping process to map the key civic network in the area. We asked local public services for the names of the five people they thought were particularly active in that community. We went to find them and asked them who they spoke to about their neighbourhood, who they trusted for reliable information about their neighbourhood, and who they would recommend to someone who was new to the neighbourhood. Then we asked the people they named the same questions.\u00a0\n\n2. Using basic network analysis on that information, and also social media and online searching to find people who weren't part of the traditional network, we produced a civic network map for each of the areas. <a href=\"http://curiouscatherine.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/quick-and-dirty-social-network-analysis/\">The process is described more fully by one of the other project partners here</a>.\n\n3. We collated the content from that civic network, plus relevant social media searches, in a website for each area (<a href=\"http://www.wlhbrunswickandregency.citizenscape.net/core/\">like this one</a>)\n\n4. We started (and are still continuing) conversations with activists in each neighbourhood on what they would want to see added to the website or contributed to the activist network in order to build democratic capacity, or support volunteering. The main requests were:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>a tool to ask public questions of the council and see public answers</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://socialmediasurgery.com/\">social media surgeries</a> to bring more people online, and get them introduced to volunteering opportunities</li>\n\n<li>tools for smaller sub-groups to help them arrange events, and see conversations in very small communities</li>\n\n<li>an event calendar</li>\n\n</ul>Here's what we learned:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>You have to keep community leadership, inclusion and co-design at the heart of what you do - and communicate that more than you think you need to. Innovation can sometimes come across as \"testing our brilliant idea on you\", particularly in communities that have had a lot of different projects tested on them. Communities have long memories.</li>\n\n<li>Make sure that community voices are heard on the project team</li>\n\n<li>Communities are suspicious of hit-and-run engagement,\u00a0particularly when the project explicitly links itself to\u00a0innovation. Make clear that you are setting up the\u00a0localities to carry on their networks for the long term, and to\u00a0become self-sufficient.</li>\n\n<li>Relationships need reciprocity. At time of cash\u00a0constraints civic activists are suspicious of possible new\u00a0burdens. Work\u00a0to deliver positive by-products through\u00a0the process for example the social media\u00a0surgeries.</li>\n\n<li>People don\u2019t think about \u201cdemocracy\u201d, they think about\u00a0needs. Although people felt that there were issues that they\u00a0wanted to raise with the council and with public services,\u00a0the civic activists we spoke to were largely uninterested in\u00a0\u201cdemocracy\u201d conceptually. They were interested in getting\u00a0solutions to community needs, and expressing community\u00a0voices - goals that actually would need to be delivered by\u00a0democracy.</li>\n\n</ul>\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-08 08:46:24", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:05.292029", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 686, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20165, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1525, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Collecting Edgeryders' experiences</b>\n\nHi Helene,\n\nThanks for taking the time to share your work with the community, boy where were you when we were designing the campaign on Commons, we could have used your thoughts on this :-)\n\nI don't have any kind of commons education except the one Edgeryders like you are providing, which makes it much easier to grasp the concept; now I find it a bit difficult when the view is holistic, up to the point that I lose touch with the basics.\n\nSo starting from the bottom, from concrete applications, many Edgeryders experiences come to my mind (classification by no means exact or exclusive):\n\n-<strong>related to physical spaces</strong>: ex. urban environmments that need to be fixed or revitalized; reappropriation of public spaces\n\nInitiatives: urban games at <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/we-create-games-urban-public-spaces\">Critical City</a> in Milan, or <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/polypolis-social-game\">Polypolis Game</a> implemented by AthensTravelers\n\n-<strong>social and political movements/ action</strong>: safeguarding cultural settings; social innovations like policy proposals to ensure basic income\n\nInitiatives: <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/legitimate-illegality-culture-commons-journey-throug-0\">Occupying theatres</a> all across Italy, and beyond; Occupy London, <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/how-do-we-overcome-fear-towards-change-call-it-magic\">15M movement</a> (Indignados)\n\n-<strong>culture as commons:</strong>\u00a0For example Bridget here does a great job supporting cultural heritage as commons, and advocating their wider spread including via the web.\u00a0\n\n- <strong>digital space as commons</strong>: <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/welcome-group/mission_case/anti-acta-poland-seen-inside\">anti-Acta </a>experiences\u00a0and other <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/spotlight-internet-common-resource/mission_case/if-internet-were-even-more-restricted-commons\">cases for Internet freedom</a>, Creative Commons, <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/hacking-change/mission_case/spaghetti-open-data-little-thing-feels-right\">open data</a> etc..\u00a0\n\nI see you are already following Bridget and know that also<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/betta83\"> Betta</a> and <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/missyk8\">MissyK8</a> here are helping design the session on commons in Strasbourg. <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/caring-commons-session\">Feel free to join their team</a> and dig in starting from what other members in the community are saying..\n\nI'm more curious though, what concrete lessons you learned at these seminars in London?

On peut alors concevoir une plateforme de donn\u00e9es publiques comme l\u2019environnement informatique qui d\u00e9cuple le potentiel des data en permettant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me d\u2019applications de se brancher \u00e0 cette plateforme par le biais de son\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface\"><span>API (Application programming interface)</span></a>.\n\nPour faire simple, les data sont introduites dans la plateforme puis disponibles et actualis\u00e9es en temps r\u00e9el. Des d\u00e9veloppeurs peuvent alors se brancher sur cette plateforme pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de donn\u00e9es qu\u2019ils vont valoriser au travers de services et applications, \u00e9ventuellement dans le cadre d\u2019un mashup avec leur technologie ou d\u2019autres API. L\u2019environnement de cet \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me, c\u2019est la co-cr\u00e9ation.\n\n<b>Data, palteforme et co-cr\u00e9ation</b>\n\nCette cha\u00eene data &gt; plateforme &gt; co-cr\u00e9ation est au coeur de la d\u00e9marche voulue par Voxe.org : ne pas se limiter \u00e0 l\u2019open data d\u00e9mocratique et proposer une\u00a0<a href=\"http://voxe.org/platform\"><span>API ouverte</span></a>\u00a0pour cr\u00e9er un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me d\u2019applications autour du comparateur de programmes politiques.

What an extraordinary community of passionate, creative and engaged people! The food was great too! Gratitude and appreciation for all those who made it possible.\n\nI want to share some thoughts on the way Edgeryders is organised (or not...). When reading this, bearing in mind that I am only an intermittent participant in the community with incomplete information.\n\n\u00a0I am fascinated by the question of community building, particularly the sort of powerful activist online/off-line committees that are seeking to affect change these days.\u00a0 It seems to me that the key to building and maintaining community is\u00a0 trust,\u00a0 enabled and supported by mutual commitments.\u00a0 When you see someone committing their time and energy to something that is inspiring, you feel moved to commit your own time and energy. As people do this over time, people start trusting the new thing which is emerging. You start to trust that your contribution will not be wasted or abused.\n\nIt seems to me that Edgeryders is going through a transition from a pure gift economy (where no money is distributed) to a more mixed one where some money will come in and will be paid to some people. Transitions, as discussed in one of the sessions, are exciting and often unpredictable and turbulent times.\u00a0 They are times when transparency in decision-making, not just what decisions are made but how decisions are made and how people can participate in them, become really important.\n\nNadia and others talked about the difficulty of finding your way about the site or knowing how to engage with it (one simple example - I just lost the first draft of this message because I forgot to login before writing it and when I did login, it disappeared).\u00a0 This may be useful as a barrier to prevent unwanted outsiders from finding out what is going on, but it doesn\u2019t help internal transparency.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to make collaborative decisions online. I predict that one of the breakthroughs we will see in the next few years is in online tools for collaborative decision-making. See <a href=\"https://www.loomio.org/about\">Loomio </a>as one recently emerged example. I think this is something that Edgeryders needs to address. I also note that the Apache software community are very good at clarifying how decisions are made and what role different people take in decision-making. See <a href=\"http://apache.org/foundation/governance/\">here</a> in particular. I think it would be really valuable for Edgeryders to do something similar. It doesn\u2019t need to be nearly so detailed or complex since Apache is a much more developed community.\n\nFrom what I can gather, some people feel intimidated by the technology, and also sometimes by the nature of the discussions online, and don\u2019t feel that their voices heard. This will tend to destroy trust over time.\n\nFrom what I have seen in my experience in business and elsewhere, the way decisions are made is generally far more important than the actual decision. A decision can be changed if it turns out to be unhelpful, but the feeling people are left with when they have been engaged in, or perhaps excluded from, a decision tends to last.\n\nThat's it for now. I hope to stay involved with the ongoing edge ride,\u00a0 and look forward to more rewarding encounters along the way.\n\nLove to you all!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-28 13:59:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:21.086335", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 604, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15723, "user_id": 3559, "topic_id": 1359, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>broken facebook link</b>\n\nThe facebook link in the post is broken.", "created_at": "2012-03-31 12:53:40", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 23:32:37.118753", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17328, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 4192, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>My constructive proposal.</b>\n\n\"<span>If you have constructive proposals for how to resolve this, you are more than welcome to suggest them.\u00a0</span>\"\u00a0\n\nMy constructive proposal is what provoked you into making a unilateral decision.

I've checked on the Multi swap site earlier this year and was hoping to find a group that could pull off an exchange engine to implement it.\n\nI would like to point out and ask a few things based on the\u00a0<a href=\"/system/files/EconomyApp-DetailedDescription.pdf\">https://edgeryders.eu/system/files/EconomyApp-DetailedDescription.pdf</a>\u00a0pdf doc:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The businesses on a large scale don't always follow an instant barter or product transportation. The essence of keeping some form of bill in exchange of service \"monetized\" and controlled by few eventually led to a debt based economy in a way. But the idea of keeping a digital transaction or a reciept of services in a local economy run off by a local currency has two advantages:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The two agencies/party are reachable - The Trust factor prevails</li>\n\n<li>The problem of local currency can be sold by Interfacing local currency with fiat money</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>The transaction can happen digitally as offered in a closed loop circuit, as outlined in the document but in real life, people/organizations usually don't \"trade stuff\" instantly as far as raw/natural resources is concerned. As in the case of overseas transportation. The flypside of local collaborative consumption are many. And we shouldn't ignore the benefits a globalized economy offers, the medical,products based,tertiary and secondary market lifestyle and health\u00a0benefits that people get are mostly due to a global network of trade. I understand this probability of forming closed loops greatly increases when a larger set of elements is gamed together - in our case the whole businesses in the current economy</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nMy Proposal\u00a0is - An effective prototype of \"Trust Calculator\" based P2P barter between 2 users exchanging in any desired\u00a0currency\u00a0\u00a0local/nonlocal and their ability to send and accept it in any of their desired currency by interfacing alternatve currencies with fiat money.\n\n<blockquote>\n\n21The tolerance can be provided by (1) users configuring an \u201cacceptable loss\u201d percentage for their barter deals, (2)\n\nusers pre-charging an account once with a moderate amount of legal tender (&lt;100 EUR), which the algorithm then\n\nuses as a buffer for generating barter deals, keeping the money on the account fluctuating around its original\n\namount, (3) a combination of the previous.\n\n</blockquote>\n\nAs I understand it (but I would like to understand it with a demo if someone can clarify \"Tolerance for dummies\") Tolerance Point 2 - Users pre charging with a\u00a0<em><strong><u>nominal amt of legal tender</u></strong></em>\u00a0- Which means there is an option to fill in my proposal- If local currencies can be interfaced with this nominal amt in the same unified account of that user, he is free to to exchange services as a bill/voucher.\n\nThis is particularly for B2B Network exchanges and alternative trading exchanges where organizations lend their services or products and esp is there is a shipment ordered, you know, say in the case of amazon.com, that you have paid for a \"Big Costly Something\" and it is supposed to reach you by this date XXYY. Similary, if exisiting B2B trade could be implemented using the system being offered by economy app, while still keeping the currency, localized currencies would just act as receipts and vanquish once the order is dealt with/received.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<u>Extension of the proposal:</u>\n\nI am working on a network prototype\u00a0that monitors the trading histories and builds trust between trading elements and gives each element/user/organization to monitor/track \"trading strength\" with all the other users - Which is a personal call for each organization/party/user to make; so if we provide a way to show this insight, the User lets say using a mobile app is better able to \"Pay/Trust\" ( Currency as a form of Trust?) the Seller/Buyer; the more they exchange the dense this bond grows and it actually enchaces local trade - a local body /network is a local union and transparent market exchange, digitally transacted and shown in that local marketplace helps everyone keep in check all the transactions happening between parties (FIgures and Things traded still abstracted ofcourse); But just like a Right to Information - for any corrupt practice during any transaction detected, the users/parties exchanging could be requested to show their record; THis is a proposed platform model Economy App could extend its features with.\n\nThus this kind of automated trust building could enchance\u00a0business dealings more while keeping local currencies in the flow and inflation proof(since they are local and not being imposed upon some far off economy with any interests rates). THe second feature is insights into trust building.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe closed loop network offered can scale globally keeping these vouchers as proof of transactions actually while actual items might take time to be transported (esp in big business dealings); The idea is when a \"Scale of Trust\" is formed within a closed circle, as also suggested in CMB/Economy App, the Actual Figure of Dealings with all the concerned parties could be better decided by the offerings/buying parties. Otherwise the problem as I find it is not just solving the matter of network bartering to Close the loop and suffice everybody's wants but to actually make sure the other person actually gets/offers what they have promised to - Unless you want it to remian in a closed room, very limited known market with people already knowing each other, bigger models usually require interactions where people don't know each other and the Need to Buy something is an \"Immediate \u007fOne\"; people wouldn't wait to find out when the network loop closes; Until the Loop closes you keep a voucher with you\u00a0- Some Method could be devised how the value of that voucher devaluates - you get what you want, the seller still sells his product /service on time - the moment a loop closes and everybody's exchange is balanced out - the Bill/Voucher/Local Currency devaluates logarithmically;\n\nThis is a very interesting path im willing to work on. And I am going over the code provided in the repo as well (although im not a Ruby person\u00a0prefer c++/python and would love to contribute)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-28 22:54:24", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 15:48:08.299557", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1130, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 35.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22580, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1334, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Diversity</b>\n\nHello Ampat,\n\nI received this information from my a <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/michel-filippi\">friend</a>, a fantastic data base: <a href=\"http://t.co/xME8Kcj6\">Neurodiversity.com</a>.\n\nThere is a section entitled 'Regional support', with sub-section '<a href=\"http://www.neurodiversity.com/international_asia.html\">Asia</a>', where they list projects and resources. You could add your project there.\n\nHow is autism perceived in your country? Is it seen as a disability, or are there people in favor of seeing it as a neurological difference?\n\nThis article published in June 2011 (written in French) talks about the <span>pride in being</span> autistic or neurologically different '<a href=\"http://t.co/Pxono1W\">Fiers d'\u00eatre autistes: la neurodiversit\u00e9, un mouvement pol\u00e9mique</a>'. I translated some bits and pieces for you. There seems to be a growing movement in English-speaking countries, in favor of \"diversity\".\n\n[My translation] \"In many English-speaking countries, activist movements are challenging the representation of autism as a disease and are now considering autism as another mode of cognitive functioning with positive and creative aspects\n\n<span>In many</span> English-speaking countries, groups of people are challenging the traditional representation of disability as an individual medical problem, and consider it from the socio-political prism. Researcher at INSERM, sociologist and neurobiologist, Brigitte Chamak research interests include the transformation of representations of autism. However, she said, studying historical dynamics of organizations of persons with autism at an international level reveals a profound questioning of autism as a \"disease\".\n\n<span>Forms of</span> activism by people with these disabilities bring to rethink the relationship between thought and society, and demonstrate new types of social movements that are set in a logic of empowerment through strong <span>culturalist </span><span>policies</span>.\n\n<span>In Anglo</span>-Saxon countries, associations of people with autism go beyond parents' associations, since it is the very idea of the \u200b\u200bdisease that they challenge. Just as some people want to be recognized not as suffering from auditory hallucinations but as \"voice hearers\", autistic patient groups campaign for recognition of their neurodiversity, that is to say that autism is considered <span>as</span> a full-fledged<span> cognitive functioning</span>.\n\nFor the advocates of neurodiversity, the question of suffering seems to take second place. They primarily aim to build strong policies related to identity, producing a kind of culturalist discourse about autism and autistic people, to help train them to defend their rights. According to Brigitte Chamak: \"The success of the mobilization lies partly in the changes not only in how people view their life situation, but also in the opinion they have of themselves.\"\n\nAt the end of this article, the author Sarah Chiche asks this question:\n\n'<strong><span><span>Why</span> </span><span><span>should only </span></span><span><span>oral communication</span> be considered as<span> legitimate</span><span>?</span></span> </strong><span><span>The infinite variety of</span> <span>modes of</span> <span>human functioning</span><span> </span><span>lead us to</span> <span>question our</span> <span>assumptions</span><span>,</span> <span>to rethink what</span> <span>the word <em>intelligent</em></span><em> </em><span>means, and what</span> <span>we mean by the</span> expression <em><span>human being</span></em><span>.</span><span>\"</span></span>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-29 15:17:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:05.605486", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 672, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20388], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30601, "user_id": 3559, "topic_id": 2921, "post_number": 23, "raw": "<b>Coming of Age in Cyberspace</b>\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh", "created_at": "2014-06-02 21:28:59", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 23:30:01.506368", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30600], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17819, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4661, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Long term consideration</b>\n\nAh.. you also have to be careful not to carry out too many nutrients.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-21 17:13:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:39.444048", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 23, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16088], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29546, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 693, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Swarms are great!

It is a potentially powerful tool.\n\nBut I would not underestimate policy. A determined policy maker can make stuff happen. In 2012, Milano invented a new policy that works like this: they put out a list of 100 entire buildings, and 1,000 smaller spaces, that the city owns. You can have one of them, for free and for up to 30 years, as long as you (1) fix it and maintain it with your own money and (2) use it for activities that have social benefits. The city is being quite proactive: in one neighborhood it might encourage activities that interest young people, in another the focus might be on migrants etc. (see <a href=\"http://www.comune.milano.it/wps/portal/ist/it/servizi/casa/chi_cerca_uno_spazio/assegnazione_su_progetto\">here</a>, in Italian).

Although he became active in Bibeksheel after completing his studies, he always showed a certain kind of political aspiration that was uncommon in his peers (including myself). So when we met to sit down after a month of the colossal disaster and what followed \u2013 an upsurge of young people getting their hands dirty, all that sweat and all that grim, to help \u201crebuild Nepal\u201d as part of the post-earthquake disaster response \u2013 we both could feel something had shifted.</em>\n\n<em><a href=\"http://en.leadnepal.com/\">Bibeksheel Nepali</a>, a political party consisting of young people, has been able to carry out relief effort in all 17 affected districts \u2013 their relief including food, tarpaulins, medical support, and initial need assessment \u2013 in a short span of time. Their group has also been able to garner a lot of support their members and supporters both outside and inside Nepal along with a large number of young volunteers. They have been receiving funding from their international committee members who have gone to study abroad but their villages have been affected. Pukar believes that they were able to receive such a huge amount of support because they have actually gone to the victims to deliver relief instead of handing it over to some other team or organization.</em>\n\n<strong>Dipti</strong>: How did the relief effort start for you and your group?\n\n<strong>Pukar</strong>: Before the earthquake of April 25<sup>th</sup>, we had actually created a disaster management protocol through trainings conducted by disaster experts because there had been predictions of earthquake. We knew that preparedness was a huge part of leadership. What we had planned was wherever we are when a disaster occurs, the first priority was to make sure that we and our families are safe and then go the nearest hospital (in this case, Teaching Hospital in Maharajgunj). This was because in any disaster scenario, the hospital gets hit the first \u2013 there is a lot of casualties that the hospitals have to bear the brunt and doctors as well as nurses undergo a lot of pressure. We had actually estimated death of 1 Lakh people.\n\nWith 40 minutes, we started a help desk. We were 10-15 people in the beginning. There were dead bodies lying around so our volunteers carried the bodies, cleaned up the bodies, took their photos for identification. We created a list of dead bodies, and injured people. We wanted to bridge that gap.\n\nWe were able to collect donations right there at the moment and we were able to get a lot of generous support. So we were able to buy gloves and masks. Initially, the doctors, nurses and even police were not willing to carry the dead bodies.\n\n<strong>Dipti</strong>: How has your or your group\u2019s interaction been like with formally existing mechanisms like the army, police, and government institutions or bodies throughout the relief effort?\n\n<strong>Pukar</strong>: What happened is our first relief effort was in Arupokhari in Gorkha and we were able to take relief materials under \u201cpersonal effort\u201d. If what we were providing had to go through some channel of the government, I fear it would have not reached them yet. The local bodies were not active during this period and all the different political parties focused on creating an all-party mechanism instead of acting on the immediate relief process. If we had entered this process, we may not have been able to provide relief for weeks.\n\nWe would have to store our materials in the DDC (District Development Committee) office. We even saw four trucks of relief materials go inside but only a small tracker came out with minimal materials. The distribution channel of the government was not effective and confident. For example, there are places A, B, C, and D. If we want to go to area D with our relief materials, the local people of A, B, and C would not allow us to do so because they would demand the relief materials even if they were not needy.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9a6c907efde0c7900a20eed7007a8ca299299d27.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\nThe police and the army (security forces) actually helped us overcome these barriers and they helped us reach these areas. But that was not the case with the local bodies because of their political affiliations.\n\n<strong>Dipti</strong>: So some of the citizen-driven initiatives that had gone to different places with relief materials also had to face similar problems?\n\n<strong>Pukar</strong>: Yes. It was very difficult for them to actually take relief materials to the intended places in the absence of these mechanisms. It was also difficult for local non-profit organizations (NGOs) because there is a certain expectation that these organizations are funded by bigger international donor organizations and the affected people expected relief materials to be distributed equally rather than through need assessment. In Listikot VDC, Sindhupalchowk, we had gone with almost 50 volunteers so this was a huge attempt but we had to actually give 10-20 sacks of rice in each village before we actually reached there otherwise, we would not have been allowed to go there at all!\n\nMaybe because of frustration, some people were drunk and blocked our way. They would want to stop us and claim over the materials.\n\n<strong>Dipti</strong>: What is one of the most significant memory of your first relief work (at Gorkha)?\n\n<strong>Pukar</strong>: The first thing I felt was the moment the people there saw trucks full of relief materials, there was a sense of \u201cOh, now we are going to be able to eat. Help has finally arrived.\u201d written all over their faces. But when they found out that it was through a personal effort and that we would only distribute after assessing the need, there was chaos. Some people, who seem to have gotten some amount of food already because they were either in a powerful position or would voice out, actually told us to take it back if it wasn\u2019t going to be distributed equally.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/57d61c78de6aa002df13f87a309ad8f5eab33831.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"414\"><br>\n\nWe had gone there after such hardship. We were 8-10 people and we had reached after 3 days of the earthquake. So, it took us almost 2-3 hours to sit down with the villagers and explain. We were very scientific about the way we distributed the relief material; we collected the number of households, the extent of damage, and then give it to the most needy ones. Then people became happy, some people even cried. We were able to reach there before the government did. We were there till late night and only returned after all that was over.\n\n<strong>Dipti</strong>: What was your impression of already existing mechanisms like youth clubs and women\u2019s group in the affected areas? Had they started to self-organize?\n\n<strong>Pukar</strong>: During our initial visit which was right after 2-3 days of the earthquake, they had not begun to self organize. It was havoc. Everyone was confused, and frustrated. They were waiting for relief. People were still in trauma. They were focused on how much relief came their way. But during our second assessment visit after two weeks, they had started to do build their houses on their own and saw no point in waiting for the government.\n\nThey had also begun to manage relief materials that came through organizations like Save The Children, who had sent a lot of materials, and there was a sense of unity around. But as you know, there aren\u2019t many young people in villages nowadays. But still, they had started to redirect relief materials to places and communities where it hadn\u2019t reached.\n\n<strong>Dipti</strong>: Have you guys coordinated with other relief teams? What has the experience been like?\n\n<strong>Pukar</strong>: Initially, we did. But later, as they started to know that Bibeksheel is actually a political party, some youths who did not want to be associated with a political party started to work independently. They are still working. But if this had been a more coordinated effort, it would have been definitely effective. Being a political party, there are certain pros and cons. We were able to work independently without any hassle but in the long-term, the nature of our organizations may be something that not everyone wants to be a part of. But given that, we were able to work with a lot of international media, government officials, and medical teams from Bangladesh, India, the USA, and Canada. Even those who had sent money to big organizations came to us because they realized that the needy people were still not receiving much so they accompanied us to different places like Rasuwa, Okhaldhunga, Sindhupalchowk, and so on by combining both our resources and efforts.\n\nSecondly, I don\u2019t know what to call it but these foreign aid organizations who have established local connections were not doing a great job at need assessment. For example, they were reaching to these villages after 15-16 days and yet they were giving things like bath liquid, detergent, and so on. We have actually recorded all of this. The people who carry out these assessments live in the central area of the affected area in expensive hotels so there is so much overhead costs which get added to the \u201caid\u201d that has been provided in relief.\n\nThere is a lot of politics in relief because there is now a trend that if the local leader/politician is able to take most relief to his/her village, then that person is likely to garner more political support.\n\n<strong>Dipti</strong>: Have you received any kind of negative feedback on the work you are doing because Bibeksheel is also essentially a political party?\n\n<strong>Pukar</strong>: Yes but to be very honest, during our relief efforts, we actually did not have any time to explain about our party to the people. That was the last thing on our priorities. We would go to these areas, distribute relief, and head back to another affected area. Some people actually told us that we should have taken leaflets about our party because this was an opportunity for us to publicize our party but although we are a political party, the volunteers and people who were supporting this relief team were not affiliated with our group. We have to keep that in mind. This was not of a political nature, it was more about selfless service. Essentially, politics is service. If our effort was of a political motive, we would have focused within Kathmandu but we prioritized unreached, inaccessible places because they were the most needy.\n\n<strong>Dipti</strong>: You mention this is an immediate relief effort and therefore, temporary in nature. Is there a longer-term vision that Bibeksheel Nepali is keen on adopting or even you as an individual? Or will this effort stop after a certain time.\n\n<strong>Pukar</strong>: Bibeksheel has been working on a protocol so it was a very organized effort. We had divided roles amongst our teams. And we will not stop this. We have actually come up with a 5R strategy \u2013 Rescue, Relief, Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, and Resurgence. We are coming to the end of relief work because the government has already started to provide financial support for rebuilding houses. Our focus now is to hold the government accountable. We want to become watchdogs.\n\nWe want to help strengthen the government mechanism along with our own political activity. This will continue until the 5R strategy is complete.\n\n<strong>Dipti</strong>: How long do you think it will take?\n\n<strong>Pukar</strong>: It will take at least 2-3 years to reach a stable environment where health institutions, schools, and government offices start to function fully. So this can actually go long-term.\n\nOur observation is that unless the government is made accountable, there is a huge possibility of corruption with the relief aid money. It has been almost a month and there hasn\u2019t even been meetings at local level between VDC secretaries and CDO officials about this. So for three weeks, no relief work was monitored or recorded by the government. There is A Team in our group which will be responsible for this task. We will probably have 2 people assigned to each affected district.\n\n<strong>Dipti</strong>: You mentioned earlier that if you had the time to reflect, you would actually like to record these reflections. So what has actually been some of the learning opportunities for you throughout this?\n\n<strong>Pukar</strong>: We have to be prepared. There has to be a plan even if it takes some time. If we had just gone randomly then it would not have been effective. Another thing is, instead of considering the government weak, we need to strengthen the government mechanism. That should have been the role of international media as well.\n\nWe have even received media coverage on how where the government hasn\u2019t reached, Bibeksheel has reached. But our intention is to strengthen government. Only then can we all be effective.\n\n<strong>Dipti</strong>: Can you think about a moment that has struck you deeply?\n\n<strong>Pukar</strong>: In the beginning, we carried dead bodies and we were trying to put up brave faces. After a while, all this became saturated \u2013 all that information of casualties, deaths, and loss stopped affecting us. But during our post-relief assessment, in Gorkha, we went to a village where Muslim community lived. I met a young kid who spread out his hands and said \u201c\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0924\u201d (relief). That was a moment that I will never forget because I started to question about whether this whole relief process is going to render us all dependent on aid again\u2026\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/378cf2fac5811ce4376e394f6e1872ac62ecdf34.jpg\" width=\"669\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nBut the youths, have been so enthusiastic and active. Now they have to hold the government accountable. That should be our focus.\n\n<strong>Dipti</strong>: Do you think there is something that you would do differently?\n\n<strong>Pukar</strong>: One thing that I definitely think is coordination \u2013 if we had been a bit more better can coordinating with other relief efforts, perhaps we would have been able to have a better reach with the relief.\n\n<strong>Dipti</strong>: Is there anything that you would like to add to our conversation?\n\n<strong>Pukar</strong>: We have had a lot of people who instead of approaching the government have approached us for relief and coordination. This actually puts a big question mark towards the political parties who have such deeper local networks and yet failed to be useful during the time of disaster. Now is the time to hold these political parties accountable. There is a need to be a bit more reflexive and critical of our political culture.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2f120b8df1bdee143507ad377d9f2599a6aa0ee0.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<em>We ended our conversation on a hopeful note where Pukar called for the youths to change their perception about politics because without interacting with the government, this whole process of citizen-driven initiative can become a mere immediate relief project and not a long-term project of government accountability. For him, there is a potential for these initiatives to become more than relief work and transform the political culture of Nepal.</em>\n\n<em>Photo Credit: Used from Pukar Bam's Facebook Page with Permission</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-26 09:54:51", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 07:32:04.312914", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2728, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 440.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2560, 2551, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 559, "user_id": 3417, "topic_id": 526, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I grew up in Thessaloniki but always had a deep want to travel, see and live in other places. Which I did. My sporadic encounters with my native Greece always brought to mind the lyrics from a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQxpBseJINY\">famous Greek song</a>\u00a0which I shall badly try to translate here:\n\n<em>\u201cOh Hellas I love you,\n\nand I thank you deeply,\n\nfor you taught me and I know\n\nhow to breathe wherever I find myself,\n\nhow to die with every step I take\n\nand how to just not be able to stand you\u201d</em>\n\nThese words are the preface for my MBA thesis for which I had to interact with Greek officials -and hence got a first hand experience of the stagnant and chaotic ways of its bureaucracy.\n\nGreece is a place of extreme and diverse beauty, almost 1/3 is under Natura protection. Within such a small geographical place there is a dose of everything (apart maybe from glaciers): snowy mountaintops for skiing, desert-like dunes, volcanic islands, prehistoric forests and countless hot springs! It feeds your soul with joy, light and clarity and you see why the term philosophy was coined up here. On the other hand, interaction with the system and the people can drive you mad in nanoseconds.\n\nIn late 2010, I had been on the road for the best part of a year, not keeping track of politics and news and had missed the handing over of the country to the IMF and the banksters. One day I heard someone say: \u2018Oh you\u2019re Greek! My condolences: your country has gone bankrupt and is in tatters\u2019..(!).. So, I thought I\u2019d check back a bit and see what goes on.\n\nEspecially after the 2004 Olympics every time I was back I felt \u2018like a fly in a glass of milk\u2019 as we say in Greek, like I do not fit in. It was as if they\u2019d all undergone mass hypnosis; everything was new, shiny, posh and expensive; credit cards arriving in the mail without having applied for one; people, euphoric and dull-eyed, going on constant shopping sprees. I felt like I was in a twilight zone surrounded by consumerist zombies!\n\nWhen I went back \u00a0a few weeks later, two things happened: a. the country was not in ruins as I was led to believe: people were out shopping and had food on their table, public transport was regular, water and electricity were still there, as were public hospitals (none of which is the same nowadays). But something was brewing, brooding even. Which leads us to b. something was different\u2026 I couldn\u2019t exactly put my finger on it, but something was a-changing.\n\nThe proof came in May 2011 and the infamous \u2018indignation\u2019 or \u2018occupy the squares\u2019 movement. I was there from the very first day, and although it was very amateuristic and problematic in various levels (and has been widely exploited for political gain) still, it was a strong, life-changing experience for most of us involved. I had never before (except from history books) seen Greeks come together in such ways and with such plurality and diversity. God-fearing pensioners working alongside young budding anarchists; apolitical housewives and disillusioned political-party members, all stepping out and taking initiative, organising, sharing openly their feelings and their food, showing solidarity, standing hand-in-hand to face the teargas and police brutality... The zombies had a heart!\n\nThe next cornerstone came in August 2011 when I was fortunate enough to be part of the Greek delegation for the\u00a0<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/37734507\">first Nyeleni Forum on European Food Sovereignty</a>. That was it for me. I decided to stay. And help. With all my strength. Since then, I dedicated myself and all my resources to bringing about change -and what a ride it\u2019s been! I can honestly say that I have never before worked as hard and with such persistence -even when I was working for a paycheck! Of course that meant many sacrifices on my part and a complete change of lifestyle as I immersed myself in the gift economy and found out how it is to have your needs met without money being the first resort.\n\nSince then I got involved with and instigated the creation of various groups, collectives, anti-privatisation initiatives etc. In October 2011 I co-organised the first Greek meeting on Food Sovereignty. In 2014 I organised the Permaculture Caravan -roaming the country for six weeks with Permaculturist <a href=\"http://www.livingincircles.com/\">Peter Cow</a> spreading the ideas of autonomy and self sustainability and creating a new hype for Permaculture around the country. I joined \u2018Neighbourhoods In Action\u2019 -a group of eco-activists that managed to get elected in local government council of Thessaloniki -and played an important role in our municipality signing the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.milanurbanfoodpolicypact.org/\">Milan Urban Food Policy Pact</a>\u00a0for the creation of Food Policy Councils. I am currently trying to put our municipality in the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.agroecocities.eu/\">European Network for Cities for Agroecology</a>, and I am the focal point for Greece -ie contact person, for the\u00a0<a href=\"http://nyelenieurope.net/\">European Food Sovereignty Movement</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://urgenci.net/\">URGENCI -the Community Supported Agriculture Movemen</a>t.\n\nI am interested in creating a new agricultural production model, focusing on agroecology and self-sufficiency and I believe we need to pursue the transition to a new way of thinking and living. We live in a time of confluence where the old and the new are still co-existing and that creates a very challenging atmosphere, so people need support, tools and skills to make it through.\n\nWe need to get involved with things like Community Supported Agriculture (CSA); sharing risks, responsibilities and rewards between growers and eaters of food, creating a new concept of human relationships, and new kinds of communities. Out of the ten million inhabitants of Greece almost half live in the area around Athens and one in Thessaloniki. There are whole regions -especially in the mountainous parts of the country, filled with ghost towns. The cities are dying due to the continuous austerity packs that suffocate entrepreneurship and chances of finding work. We need to revive rural areas by promoting small-scale agriculture, empowering farmers and inspiring rural lifestyle, by combining traditions and technology, and promote an economy based on social solidarity and alternative currencies. \u00a0\n\nThis is also, in its heart, a political issue: we need to emancipate ourselves as political beings, as citizens and as consumers and we need to create a new way for governing and caring for our societies and be responsible custodians of the abundance of nature for ourselves and all other species and for the generations to come. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n*For my take on the crisis as a \u201cvirtual crisis\u201d and what it means for our food, please watch my\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NzDEBOeSWQ\">short speech</a>\u00a0during\u00a0<a href=\"http://solikon2015.org/en\">Solikon Berlin</a>\u00a0(The Solidarity Economy European Congress 2015) last year.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/8NzDEBOeSWQ\n\nIf you are unaware of what Food Sovereignty is all about you can watch\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7k2wnkt1sw\">this</a>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/R7k2wnkt1sw\n\nSo if all of this sounds interesting, if you feel the urge to get involved, or if you have information and contacts that can help, please contact me to join forces :)\n\nTo see what I am currently involved in and all the exciting things we are creating at present in Greece and around Europe, please follow <a href=\"/t/from-eco-activism-to-food-sovereignty-and-beyond/527\">this link</a>\n\n<em>The production of this article was supported by\u00a0<a href=\"/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296\">Op3n Fellowships</a>\u00a0- an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-14 12:52:14", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 03:36:00.071189", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1429, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 26.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15190, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 2334, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>This is really strange!</b>\n\nI just wrote the post on open budget, but it came out as Arthur's work.

I'll try to be brief.\n\n<strong>1. Super late organization on our side</strong> - I and Pavlos prepared the methodology a bit late, especially given that some of the potential participants were curious about the details program. As a result, we were not able to explain what exactly will be done, and it might have been one of the reasons why not many people showed up. Hopefully\u00a0low participation won't be the case in Berlin and Brussels, where events will be delivered by community members. One of the mistakes was merely renting a space and calling for catering. I think community behind is super important to make it a success, even if it the community itself might attract only some of potential partners.\u00a0\n\n2. We had only 12 participants (not even at the same time, they came and went) during the whole day, which is extremely poor for a city as big as Thessaloniki. Not sure why is that - the minimum we set was 20. And all that despite having employed people on the ground.\n\n3. The outline of the workshop I have drafted:\n\n- Introduction of Opencare, Openandchange and Edgeryders \u00a0(done by me)\n\n- Introduction to stories of care we collected - they were presented on the wall in form of short texts, and I was there to discuss them in more details whenever someone was interested\n\n- Introduction of participants\n\n- Mapping the status quo (world cafe with collection of ideas on the walls)\n\nImagine the care system in Greece in 10 years\u00a0\n\n- World Cafe - an exercise\u00a0in which participants could express their ideas for improvements and changes in the system\n\n- Transition framing and how to do the personal \u00a0projects represented at the workshop fit the transition\n\n- Interviews and discussion (I have made one interview right after the workshop which will be published soon.\n\nIt was more than enough to fill 8 hours.\u00a0\n\n4. <a href=\"/t/openandchange-thessaloniki-greeks-imagine-the-future-of-care/703\">Summary</a> - very broad and generic, which is a warning to all of us. If we keep the workshop on a very theoretical level, we will end up with a summary that could basically fit any of the workshops about care. We need to prepare texts that have a lot of substance and lead a discussion that is deeply grounded. Still, from my discussions with some of the participants and observations I had a feeling they were very engaged and passionate about the meeting, and OPENandchange.\n\n5. I couldn't engage a lot, only one person was a foreigner who didn't speak Greek besides me. I am truly sorry for that, but I felt that shifting the dynamic (the groups kept on using Greek and a friend of the Spanish boy was translating for him most of the time) and imposing a language in which part of the group wasn't very comfortable would slow down the process. Also as most of the publicity for the event was done in Greek, I think it was fair to stick to Greek.\n\nif anything else needs to be explained, clarified or added - just leave a comment, as usual;)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-09 12:26:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:33.882910", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 593, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 45.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9375, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3208, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Great idea, man</b>\n\nLet's prototype it in LOTE4!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-25 12:18:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:54.042538", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27506, "user_id": 2878, "topic_id": 4686, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>I'm in</b>\n\n11 AM on Friday sounds OK for me.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-27 11:59:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:31.926832", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27443], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32937, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2199, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>Thanks Marc</b>\n\nThanks for this, [Marc].

This exit is a bit different than any other exit on the ring road as it is not done by the government , It is done by the people of Al Mu'tamidia during the 3 months of the collapse of the secuirty apparatus after Moubarak ouster.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/Opj56Tx3ss4\nTo know the story from the begining:  Al Mu'tamidia is like any other informal settlement in Cairo is cut off from the main road beside it and don't have access to it and this leads to daily transportation problems but people always manage to find pop up solutions by building small stairs leading to the ring road where there is always \u201cinformal\u201d microbuses stations.and this is accompanied by  more small interventions like tea stands ,coffee shops and car repair points.\n\nThe people of Al Mu'tamidia needed to build this exit from a long time ago and when the chance opened for constructing it they took the chance during the \u201ctemporary collapse of local authorities \u201c.\n\nThat project is a huge project that costed 1 million Egyptian pounds, including 4 ramps like the official exits from the ring road,  and people of Al Mu'tamidia contributed to it with effort, money and expertise through a local community initiative called \"Al Mu'tamidia baladna\u201d which means \u201cAl Mu\u2019tamidia is our country\u201d .They documented the process of construction in a video and after finishing the exit they invited the local authorities to come and inaugurate the exit.\n\nThat was a scene from a big scale urban intervention in Cairo which \u201cwe\u201d knew about it from the amazing work of cluster , you can know more about these interventions and more in this publication which is the source of this story.\n\n----------\n\n##:ar: _Arabic version_ <a

I am reasonably familiar with the concept, though I never saw the word in complexity science context \u2013 the people that explored the interface between chaos and order in the final quarter of the 20th century tend to speak more of \"self-organization\" (Kaufman, Bak)\u00a0or \"edge of chaos\" (Langdon). \"Chaordic\" seems to come from more from a business context \u2013 the word was apparently <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaordic\">minted by the CEO of Visa</a>\u00a0in the very paper you linked. \"Self-organizing\" and \"chaordic\"\u00a0are more or less synonyms, but they have different connotations: using the former tells the reader \"we are the kind of people that do hard science, or at least are curious about it\"; using the latter conveys \"we are interested in unorthodox forms of business organizations\". I think there is no way\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0to convey some meaning by connotation: and I suggested we use connotation to imply rigor and even nerdiness. This is all theater, of course: we are who we are, a mix of rigor and sloppiness just like all humans, individuals and in communities. But, as you say, we need to communicate, and I am finding rigor and nerdiness to be... marketable.

So probably, lots more people will agree. They would agree that the interviews are published under the open source CC-BY 3.0 licence just like all written contributions on edgeryders.eu.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Visit the initiatives and make video interviews.</strong> The interviews can be visually appealing by filming people at work and letting them explain what they do and show what they have done. However, it should still be interviews because then, their transcription is valid first-hand material for our ethnographic research. (It's also dialog, just verbal not written.)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Post the video interviews in the name of the interviewees.</strong> This keeps the automated dialogue statistics in order lateron. We would open an account for each interviewee, and send them the username and password.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Subtitle the interviews and (if needed) translate the subtitles.</strong> We would again use <a href=\"http://amara.org/en/\">Amara</a> for this task, and also copy the subtitle file below the video as textual content. Doing so enables us to use our QDA software to tag the textual content. Ideally, we would find a way to automatically have JavaScript links in each line of this textual content that navigate the user to the corresponding part of the video. That combines fast cross-reading ability for text with nice visual content; I've never seen it yet, which is strange, because it seems such a nice idea :)</li>\n\n<li><strong>Tag the transcriptions with Open Ethnographer.</strong> Just as we would tag any normal textual content in posts.</li>\n\n<li><strong>(optional) Allow interviewees to comment without login.</strong> They would associate the comment content with their account by simply entering their e-mail address in the comment, not having to remember a password.

This means:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Short sentences</li>\n\n<li>Simple words. Example: replace \"participate\" with \"take part\".</li>\n\n<li>Few or no adverbs. They are \"kryptonite for verbs\". Replace your verb with a more forceful one and kill the adverb.</li>\n\n<li>Few or no passive forms.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThe idea is getting your reader to focus on your message, not your prose.\u00a0\n\nHere's the clever bit: Hemingway dispenses its advice in real time. When your sentence becomes too long, bang! It becomes highlighted in red. You want the red to go away, so you rethink the sentence and break it down. At the end, you have simpler, clearer writing.\u00a0\n\nNative speakers of romance languages, like Italian or French, are seldom fans of this style. We like clarity, sure, but terse writing seems a little... inconsiderate. Yet, I submit that Hemingway's style is great for online debate. Edgeryders is a good case in point. We write to interact with others; if we do it well, many people end up reading what we write. The potential for wasting people's time in struggling with unclear phrasing is large.\u00a0\n\nThe math is simple. A good post in Edgeryders gets 100-200 readers. A top-notch one gets 400-600. Suppose you reword your post and manage to make your reading time go down by one minute. Congratulations! You just saved the community 2 to 10\u00a0hours of reading time.\u00a0\n\nYou might ask: what about subtlety? We use adverbs to attenuate our meaning. This is typical of academic writing: academics are not supposed to write \"X is true\", but \"X is (generally/likely) true\".\u00a0\n\nAt Edgeryders, we believe open conversation is an engine of collective intelligence. The operative word here is \"collective\". The best contributors are those who create the most opportunities for others to contribute. A great way to make space for others is to make one's statements vulnerable to falsification. If I say \"X may be true\", I can never be wrong, even if X is false. I covered my individual back.\u00a0We as a collective pay the\u00a0price, because many people do not engage with non-falsifiable statements. And we know from Karl Popper's work that there is no way to make progress outside falsification. The collective smarts of a group comes down to its protocol for disagreeing.\u00a0\n\nThe Hemingway App encourages clarity. A clear statement is more falsifiable. A group that communicates with clarity will have more collective smart than one that does not. By the same token, clarity entails a risk for the communicator. If you are clear and you make a mistake, someone is bound to notice and call you out on it. If you make\u00a0mistakes, even many deliberate ones, and shroud them in bullshit, you'll get away with it. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair\">Alan Sokal's famous hoax</a> showed it.\u00a0\n\nI have decided clarity works for me. I accept the individual risk.\u00a0What I get in return is the opportunity to be part of a smart group, that learns faster because its members are not afraid of making mistakes in public. So, Hemingway App it is for me. This very post was written with it. Now I am sharing this tip with you in the hope it is useful to you, too.\n\nYou can try it <a href=\"http://www.hemingwayapp.com/\">here</a>.

Un mix esplosivo che per\u00f2 oggi, effettivamente, mostra la corda, non tiene pi\u00f9. Ai tempi in cui mi laureai io, era il 2000, era raro sentire di gente che partiva. Ce n'era, ma era raro.

So per esperienza (faccio l'Assessore in un piccolo Comune...) quanto la Politica abbia fame e sete di 'figate': posso solo dire \"occhi aperti\". Io, per quanto mi riguarda, dopo anni di frequentazione un po' laterale del mondo del sociale e delle politiche pubbliche locali, avendo creato alcuni anni un 'Festival delle fragilit\u00e0 metropolitane' (vedi: http://www.naufragi.it) insieme a un gruppo di amici sto creando le condizioni perch\u00e9 anche a Bologna possa aprire uno spazio in cui far confluire queste energie, uno spazio (questa volta per\u00f2 fisico, perch\u00e9 va bene la Rete ma bisogna pur incontrarsi) per l'innovazione sociale.\n\nA brevissimo saremo nelle condizioni di far partire la campagna di comunicazione per il lancio di un processo che, se va bene, potr\u00e0 condurre un nuovo HUB a Bologna.

A range of skilled individuals involved with a range community groups and initiatives, and collaboration with @Nadia (<a href=\"/\">EdgeRyders LBG</a>). We\u2019ve just submitted our report to Galway 2020. Many outcomes during and after the event including the adding of stories to Opencare.\n\nWe\u2019re hoping to roll out Pilgrim: Year One this year. The provisional plan feels epic.

This one would be different. It would concentrate on sustainability. It would not be an expensive event requiring lots of funding, only to die as soon as the funding dries up. And it would be all about the follow up activities it promotes and celebrates. Here in Matera I would further develop the <a href=\"/t/the-viral-academy/358\">Viral Academy project </a>to support the educational aspects of Open Culture. This would include how to use, translate, code, and maintain an open source server - with open and free Viral Academy lessons leading to effective stewardship of this digital asset for the local community. The festival would therefore promote engagement in a year round programme of education and training opportunities, leading to a celebration of the growth of thee community owned digital assets, and providing an international platform for local people to showcase there work.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">This project would work with existing local partners, is designed to synergise with the work of other applicants.

We would run training courses at several venues around the city (the University, the kung Fu School, the <a href=\"http://www.liceoartisticomatera.it/\">Liceo Artistico</a>, Mediatec, and <a href=\"http://guerillaoffice.com/\">Guerilla Office</a> venues around the city. This would be an urban autonomous university on open culture! I've researched the venues, and with the exception of the Mediatec which we should know about soon, we have permission to run courses at all these venues. Working with the guys at\u00a0<a href=\"http://guerillaoffice.com/\" style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 22.100000381469727px;\">Guerilla Office</a>\u00a0and some of the caf\u00e9s and hotel lobbies we have found here with good wifi, we'd add to the map free spaces for urban learning.\n\nThese courses would extend the work of the Open Tech School, and in particular we would work on the following concrete applications to be presented at the Open Culture Festival in October. These would include:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>An open source server running a variety of services supporting open culture</li>\n\n<li>A development server for students to learn and contribute to these services</li>\n\n<li>Loomio and Share Tribe platforms for open democracy, local resource sharing, and a community market place</li>\n\n<li>Open Street Map, and open data assets integrated into the above platforms (particularly WordPress).</li>\n\n<li>An open source cross platform mobile application, built and created by local people, and celebrating the open culture event.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nI would run these courses on the ground, based on the work already done, and support them with online training via the Viral Academy. My role would be to co-ordinate the festival, and work in close co-operation with existing and new projects that would like to take part in the event. I would also teach daily courses here and online, and seek to engage EdgeRyders and other remote communities in a co-learning process.\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><b>My Skills and experience</b></div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Skills:</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Agile Project Management</li>\n\n<li>Festivals and Event Management</li>\n\n<li>Mobile App Development</li>\n\n<li>Teaching</li>\n\n<li>Coding for installations, servers, and mobile</li>\n\n<li>Science, biochemistry, medicine</li>\n\n<li>Art and installations</li>\n\n<li>Philosophy, writing, pitching, presenting</li>\n\n<li>Democracy, liquid, and gladiatorial</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><strong>Previous Experience:</strong></div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>a wide and diverse range of failures</li>\n\n<li>a student multimedia note taking system for Medical Students (1988)</li>\n\n<li>15 CD_ROMS for commercial publishers</li>\n\n<li>a bunch of trashy advertising based websites and projects for a range of top-10 agencies in London</li>\n\n<li>interactive theatre, dance, music, and video installations including several arts council commissions</li>\n\n<li>one of the founders of Liquid Democracy, and developed Liquid Law and a range of democratic projects in art and real community projects</li>\n\n<li>developed and project managed the technical and Creative Commons licensing structure of a Vienna based community TV channel (<a href=\"http://okto.tv/\">OKTO</a>)</li>\n\n<li>architex anonymous - early experiment<span>\u00a0(2004)\u00a0</span>working with Architecture and Design students using p2p teaching, mediawiki, wordpress and concept + geolocated mapping in Istanbul.</li>\n\n<li>open secret - 3 month residency working with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintessenz\">Quintessenz</a> based on the first ever hacking of the NSA</li>\n\n<li>FlowerBank and the Book of Money - early experiments with crypto currencies</li>\n\n<li>www.festivalofmint.org</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><strong>Current projects:</strong></div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>www.viral.academy</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div><strong>References:</strong></div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>@leashless</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><b>What attracts me to collective living and working</b></div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">I love and respect tolerance, openness, and the respect for privacy within a sharing community.

So, you see health and sustainability as an essential component of cultural activity. This goes back to the issue of activist burnout, which keeps recurring in the Edgeryders community. To ensure health and sustainability, you bake prevention/wellness activities into cultural programmes. So, a side effect of doing culture is (over time) a reduction in treatment of acute health conditions.\u00a0\n\nI am starting to think that this is where most of the impact of communities on care comes from. Communities can \"corral\" us into avoiding destructive choices (heavy drinking, overeating...). They provide support in wellness/preventative activities, and that reduces human and financial costs of havingn to treat acute afflictions down the line.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-06 10:00:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:35.778692", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 128, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 22.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14308], "is_liked_by": [4196], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4599, "user_id": 2730, "topic_id": 4566, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The aftermaths of Baisakh 12 have been long behind to already be recorded in history books. Yes, it was disastrous, and the images of it will not be forgotten for at least one generation. May be the fact of its official record in the social media will make it last even longer. The dead ones just went with it, but those Nepali who lived it will always feel their feet shaking, and the heart pulse increasing. The Great disaster, it bought us the tragedy we had long predicted that would destroy Kathmandu. It did.\n\nThe most affected was Sindhupalchowk, a death toll nearly double the count of the capital, in addition of the recent landslide it had been through. The villages and the town areas, the people with all kind of dreams, all got the same fate. Barpak village in Gorkha, the epicenter, was like swept away by the quake, no house remained. The hospitals were filled with the victims and the dead bodies. Well these facts are well recorded in the official books and the photos are all available in social media.\n\nThen comes the international aid. The huge aids, in the form of money, in the form of food and shelter materials, all came within. That one act I remember the most that was all over social media, Discouraging the foreign aiders to transfer funds to PM relief fund. And I think it kind of did performed to some extent. But at the end, the locals were also collecting money in the same fund. It takes time, but it\u2019s always the government who are the responsibility holders.\n\nAlso my sympathies to the lives lost during aid distribution, specially to the American team helicopter that crashed in Sindhupalchowk, and another helicopter incident that took the life of Pilot Subek Shrestha, who was on the way to rescue mission. The fates of human are so strange, nature just showed an upper hand, but what wrong had we done? I hope their services will be well remembered by the Nepali people. It may take time but we have to rise again in the dreams of a better Nepal.\n\nThe Earthquake gave us a place in the international media; the football clubs were wearing T-shirts with \u201cSupport Nepal\u201d and all. The international citizens aiding the Nepali students and NRNs\u2019 in fund collection. The international media like BBC and CNN covering the footages of Nepal. I found it quite bad, that of all the things, it was this disaster that made us known in the world. We cried in the country and those who were taking the pictures were giving us an international identity.\n\nAfter the quake almost swept the capital and the nearby area, the most it could and taking as many lives on the way. There are now plans and promises of an upgraded city. Government is already ready with the budget that might exceed some Ten Billion rupees. Also the laws are added. But will they be implemented? Will the tall houses that were constructed by attaching some cash in the construction papers, finally lower to the level they must have stood? Is the government ready to take strict action without discriminating who owns the house, whether it be a common man who worked through his life, or some corrupt politician, business man who got through the short way?\n\nEven more than government, are we ready? Can we all say that the houses must be brought down to the levels?\n\nThe answer to these questions will probably shape how Nepal is going to look like for the times to come. Because the real estate will get only higher with time, but if it is managed, it can hit more effectively. But should we talk about money and economy over the human lives? How many times have we done that?\n\nThat\u2019s another thing the quake taught us, no matter how much money one got, or how tall house he/she owned, all came down to the road for sleeping. The place most of people thought for low-lives. May be it showed the standard of human life, where everybody can be treated equal.\n\nBut that was just for some times, many people who were residing on roads, and on those tents of Tudikhel, will never try to remember that afterwards, but we know what happened, and under similar circumstances, those thing will repeat. But the question for us now is will we stand to change the nation now? Will we change in ourselves?\n\nSwarup Rajbhandari\n\nTripureswor, Kathmandu\n\nStudying BEIT at NCIT\n\nswarup.rajbhandari@gmail.com\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-20 09:18:13", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 14:37:30.639713", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 792, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2687, 137, 2743], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22974, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4480, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Thorny indeed. I haven't given the issue the amount of thought it deserves but I think it really looks different depending on what perspective you take on it. So \"cardinal virtues\" may not be very helpful, if everything is strongly context dependent - which is my general perception. Without going into detail (also because I'm still very shaky on them) I'd point to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alasdair_MacIntyre#Whose_Justice.3F_Which_Rationality.3F_.281988.29\">Alasdair MacIntyre's approach</a> to the general dilemma.\n\nNow on the pragmatic side, I'd try to have my system work best for the intermediate case of all manual to all mental labor - if I have to pick one. Classrooms, screens, and schools have their place, but in short, I think we've overdone it (partially because it looked cheaper in the spreadsheets). Mens <em>et</em> manus. Thus you sound like my target audience - so please feel free to criticize without remorse.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QGxNyaXfJsA?t=75\">Cameras </a>and listening devices will probably just turn into a fact of life (just like our trackers have). We could perhaps re-privatize the skies (+ some enforcement) but short of that you're better off \"buying a couple of hats and sunglasses\". That does not mean <em>we</em> should stop thinking, or drop any inhibitions - but we can be pretty sure some party will. And we've learned some of them have pretty deep pockets too.\n\nSo what could we do? My current favorite approach for digital things would encrypt stuff using multiple pgp-style keys. So in a collaboration, stuff that gets archived is no use to an external party (they can still download it though) unless the group members let them decrypt it. Ideally one would be able to implement things like 2 out of 3 keys is enough - so if a key gets lost, or someone doesn't react you can still get things done.\n\nThen I think it would be important to have different levels of security, and default settings of course. The basic security should fence off automated large scale snooping and penetration mostly (say make it 3-5 magnitudes more costly to snoop). The higher level assumes you already are on someone's list and you need to assume there are some man-hours sunk into digital and IRL penetration attempts. I think that would severely limit what you want to do digitally though.\n\nFor the soft security I could imagine a sort of \"veto\" style release routine. Content will be accessible to the involved parties <em>exclusively </em>for, say 3 days. If no one wants to veto (or extend the delay, or modify the license) a release, it goes public after that time pretty much automatically (e.g. a query to people's enigmail settings - replied through default settings). Ideally you could nest such groups/licenses into each other easily.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-01 13:10:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.585201", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 500, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22961], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15786, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3885, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>how many ethnographers do we expect?</b>\n\nis this issue likely to occur?

Le Fonds Anges Qu\u00e9bec Capital sera d\u00e9di\u00e9 aux entreprises innovantes dans les premi\u00e8res phases de leur d\u00e9veloppement, car c\u2019est l\u00e0 qu\u2019elles ont le plus grand besoin de capitaux. Mais c\u2019est l\u00e0 aussi qu\u2019elles ont le plus de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9unir les fonds n\u00e9cessaires, car, sans l\u2019appui d\u2019investisseurs, les institutions financi\u00e8res h\u00e9sitent \u00e0 se lancer dans un projet qui comporte tout de m\u00eame une bonne part de risque. Pour chaque dollar investi par les Anges, le Fonds pourra ajouter jusqu\u2019\u00e0 2 $. Ce fonds de co-investissement viendra donc bonifier les sommes investies par nos membres aupr\u00e8s des entreprises qui disposeront maintenant d\u2019un meilleur levier financier pour franchir cette \u00e9tape cruciale de leur d\u00e9veloppement \u00bb.\n\nLe Fonds Anges Qu\u00e9bec Capital b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiera d\u2019une importante synergie avec le plus important r\u00e9seau d\u2019anges investisseurs au Qu\u00e9bec. En effet, le r\u00e9seau Anges Qu\u00e9bec servira de lien entre les entrepreneurs et le fonds. Il sera la porte d\u2019entr\u00e9e des demandes. Ses ressources seront mises \u00e0 contribution pour l\u2019acheminement, l\u2019analyse et le montage financier des projets d\u2019investissement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au fonds. Ainsi, le fonds contribuera \u00e0 structurer davantage l\u2019action des anges investisseurs au Qu\u00e9bec, et ce, au profit des jeunes entreprises technologiques qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-01 18:31:33", "updated_at": "2017-09-13 16:03:56.907481", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 706, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19497, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5720, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Great</b>\n\nYes, I imagined something like this.

Given that EdgeRyders is one of the platforms we should be communicating on, it seems a good place to start.\n\nFirstly, I wanted to ask EdgeRyders, what sort of information are you missing on the unMonastery, what would you like to know?\n\nSecondly, what should we be prioritising in our communication to Matera? (One for @ritao, @ilariadauria and @lois)\n\nWe\u2019ve been </span><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/unmonastery/albums\"><u>doing public reviews</u></a><span> - but these don\u2019t seem to be working beyond documentation. Although it seems that more frivolous entries reward us with substantial press, I\u2019m not sure we can indulge too much of that.\n\nIt seems to make sense that more people start sharing the use of the unMon twitter account, by all accounts the Facebook account is pretty active but I have no way of knowing.\n\nThere was some move towards getting everything in one place, maybe someone can update me on the progress of this?\n\nSo a good way to go I think is coming up with recipes or habits, that can be repeated on a weekly basis. Here\u2019s some ideas: </span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>unMonastery Town Crier, an audio or video piece each week announcing events and news of the unMonastery in a short sharp 1-2 minute video. </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Presenting a new or developed prototype each week. As is tradition. We tend to create new things, however banal I thought it could be interesting to present one regularly. </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Bembo\u2019s Podcast series. Bembo is writing an enormous amount, more than a few people have come back to me and asked why are these not in greater circulation? - I thought the writing style is very well suited to a podcast. I think Bembo agrees. </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Mistake a week. Sharing one mistake from the book of mistakes a week. </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Tour of the unMonastery (this is more likely a monthly affair) </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Sharing the insight of past orders (thought this might be one for you <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>, also <a href=\"/u/toolosophy\">@TOOLosophy</a>)</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Daily Diary (<a href=\"/u/ritao\">@Rita O</a> can you expand on your thinking?)</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>One Ramblr journey (<a href=\"/u/lucia\">@Lucia</a> I was amazed by what you showed me today, perhaps check with people if they're okay for you to share?)</span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n \n\n<span>Does EdgeRyders use recipes? Or can you suggest one?\n\nI\u2019d also like to ask that beyond a defined set of recipes that everyone take responsibility for posting at least one thing a week online about the progress of their project or a discovery, or an experience in Matera. One piece of content seems reasonable, no?\n\nThe other thing I wanted to consider is how can we make it easier for others to write about unMonastery if they so wish? </span>", "created_at": "2014-04-18 17:57:30", "updated_at": "2019-06-22 15:18:02.210351", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 527, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1438], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4983, "user_id": 2330, "topic_id": 4950, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>This was the agenda:</span>\n\n- Registration/Join the Team adjustments suggested by Antiheroes\n\n- Supporting partners updates\n\n- Speakers/Participants/Partners updates\n\n- Development track launch\n\n- Twitter feed setup\n\n- Ticket policy round II\n\n- Logo choice?\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Sitemap/Ticket policy round II:</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Feedback from FuckupNights community on the LOTE5 minisite:</span></span>\n\n<span><span>-not very clear what Edgeryders/ LOTE5 is</span></span>\n\n<span><span>-hard to understand where to start, how to contribute etc.</span></span>\n\n<span><span>-intimidating.. less actionable but says a lot.</span></span>\n\n<span><span><span><span><font color=\"#000000\">Kira proposed a new website map in order to overcome this. </font><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HQCVFX8rAoQM6WsmWAM5PFbB4e6YRH_rILXfTvs_rWQ/edit?usp=sharing\"><font color=\"#1155cc\"><u>Here</u></font></a></span><span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HQCVFX8rAoQM6WsmWAM5PFbB4e6YRH_rILXfTvs_rWQ/edit?usp=sharing\"> </a>the link.</span></span></span></span>\n\n<span><span>We need:</span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>to redesign the Welcome page with a new pic + LOTE5 logo (Kira)</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>need a new page with \u201cWho is behind this\u201d (Noemi to set up, Kira to edit)</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>re-design the tasks page with Teams, more similar to last year (Noemi) -&gt;

CC-BY-SA meets the criteria of the <a href=\"http://opendefinition.org/od/\">Open Definition</a> (Share Alike is an \"Acceptable Condition\" to users' rights under section 2.2.3); but even if it did not, it makes sense that each person sets the license of her own project. CC-BY was chosen when Edgeryders was still a Council of Europe project as an even more open license. At the time, we could not envision a spinoff and non-CoE projects riding on the platform.</li>\n\n<li>In fact, it would be simple to add a \"License\" field to nodes of type project. This is the way GitHub has it: upon creating a repository, you are asked for a license (fun fact: the authors of about 80% of repositories <i>still</i> could not be bothered to choose one). We would not even have to alter the Legals page, that says \"Expect where otherwise specified...\" </li>\n\n<li>However, this does limit interoperability of within-Edgeryders content. This is only a problem to the extent that we aspire to release open data (see the <a href=\"/t/this-is-your-land-edgeryders-as-an-engine-of-collective-intelligence/3364\">data strategy</a> for more on this), and this way contribute to the commons. In practice, at the moment (spring 2015) there is only one open data project sitting on top of Edgeryders, and it concerns not content, but data<em> about </em>content<em>.</em> It is a small FLOSS project called Edgesense, a real-time network analysis of the Edgeryders conversation (<a href=\"http://edgeryders.edgesense.spazidigitali.com\">live dashboard</a> provisional link \u2013 <a href=\"https://github.com/Wikitalia/edgesense\">code</a>). If you go to the dashboard, you will see a small \"download\" icon top right: that generates a GEXF graph file. In the final version (almost there now!) this file will be documented and licensed according to the Open Knowledge Foundation's <a href=\"http://data.okfn.org/doc/data-package\">Data Package</a> convention, and pseudonymized. If we had posts and comments licensed under CC-BY-SA or any other license, the license of the secondary data (the graph file, in this case) would break down. </li>\n\n<li>I am seeing three possible solutions to this. One (easiest): restrict the license of the secondary data (graph file) to the most restrictive license used on the primary data (posts and comments). To be able to do open data, the license cannot be any more restrictive than CC-BY-SA. So, in practice, the choice of license on ER would be restricted to CC0, CC-BY, CC0-SA and CC-BY-SA.

\"social innovation\" and \"business model canvas\" no more, there are times in which we are nonetheless obliged to confront with such idioms: and <a href=\"/t/are-we-a-partly-italian-cultural-innovation/2132/10\">this</a> is one of them, so I need your help!\u00a0\n\n<strong>What is, in your perspective, the Business Model Canvas of the unMonastery?</strong> I created this as a wiki, so we can all edit it.\u00a0\n\n<strong>ITALIAN VERSION</strong>\n\n<strong>Partner chiave</strong>: Edgeryders, con la sua presenza globale, serve a connettere unMonastery con un pool di potenziali residenti e partners. Il prototipo di Matera \u00e8 partner della citt\u00e0, che fornisce lo spazio fisico, e del Comitato Matera 2019, che fornisce alcune risorse e ottiene in cambio un laboratorio di innovazione sociale importante per la candidatura a capitale europea della cultura 2019; di Sviluppo Basilicata, il cui incubatore nei Sassi accoglier\u00e0 nuove imprese che dovessero nascere dall\u2019esperienza.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Attivit\u00e0 chiave</strong>: Le attivit\u00e0 chiave sono le residenze per innovatori. Sono distribuite su tre dimensioni: interna (costruire uM come istituzione), esterna (costruire valore per la comunit\u00e0 locale), di interfaccia (integrare uM nella comunit\u00e0 locale). Attivit\u00e0 come sviluppo di software per l\u2019intelligenza collettiva, comunicazione, animazione territoriale, advocacy, consulenze e fundraising saranno dedicate a rinforzare il modello e aiutarlo a scalare.\n\n<strong>Risorse chiave</strong>: Sono tre. la presenza, in Europa, di molti giovani dotati di competenze di alto livello, che tuttavia per varie ragioni rimangono ai margini del mercato del lavoro. un edificio da usare come spazio condiviso di vita e di lavoro. risorse di legittimit\u00e0, in grado di dare agli unMonasterians un ruolo sociale e costruire un canale di comunicazione \u2013 anche economica e di servizio \u2013 tra unMonastery e citt\u00e0.\n\n<strong>Valore offerto</strong>: unMonastery \u00e8 un punto di irradiazione della cultura hacker e dell\u2019innovazione sociale verso una comunit\u00e0 locale. Utilizza le residenze per importare competenze di altissimo livello e pensiero radicale in citt\u00e0 medie e piccole; lo spirito di servizio insito nella metafora del monastero per schierare queste competenze a sostegno di progetti che coinvolgono i cittadini e affrontano sfide locali; e la radicalit\u00e0 di pensiero e azione per fare questo usando il pi\u00f9 possibile risorse non finanziarie.\n\n<strong>Relazioni con i clienti</strong>: Il modello dell\u2019unMonastery funziona con la creazione di rapporti di comunit\u00e0 - tra gli unMonasterians, con la comunit\u00e0 ospitante e in rete. Creare comunit\u00e0 permette di risolvere i problemi e condividere la conoscenza senza intermediazione: nelle 3 dimensioni (interna, esterna, di interfaccia) le relazioni di fiducia favoriscono la cultura del dono, del baratto, della circolazione dei saperi, del servizio. Comunit\u00e0, intelligenza collettiva e sostenibilit\u00e0 sono fortemente legate.\n\n<strong>Canali</strong>: unMonastery segue la logica del prototipo: grazie al lavoro preparatorio in citt\u00e0 individua soggetti con esigenze specifiche; studia insieme a loro soluzioni hacker; le collauda e migliora, sempre insieme a loro. In questo modo, il prototipo stesso e il passaparola tra le persone che lo usano diventa il canale commerciale dei servizi di unMonastery. Un altro canale importante \u00e8 lo spazio fisico, sempre aperto ai cittadini e sempre animato.\n\n<strong>Segmenti di clientela</strong>: Il principali clienti sono i cittadini delle comunit\u00e0 locali che ospitano l\u2019unMonastery: attraverso i laboratori partecipati, la cittadinanza attiva si segmenta da s\u00e9 intorno a clusters di criticit\u00e0 locali, creando spontaneamente dei bacini d\u2019utenza per i singoli prototipi. L\u2019altro segmento di clientela \u00e8 fatto di innovatori (hackers, permacoltori, attivisti, artisti) interessati a programmi di residenze in cui applicare le loro competenze a problemi contestualizzati.\n\n<strong>Struttura dei costi</strong>: La struttura dei costi \u00e8 ridotta al minimo: quelli variabili sono progressivamente autoprodotti (orto), recuperati (abbigliamento) e autocostruiti (mobili, utensili). I costi fissi riguardano il sito (gas, riscaldamento, internet), le attivit\u00e0 e le risorse chiave per rinforzare il modello e aiutarlo a scalare. Considerati i costi di consulenza esterni impegnati dalle PA, o i costi dell'inazione e dell'immobilismo, l'unMonastery \u00e8 un laboratorio a basso costo e alto potenziale d'impatto sociale.\n\n<strong>Flussi dei ricavi</strong>: l\u2019unMonastery \u00e8 il laboratorio che prototipa prodotti e servizi per criticit\u00e0 legate ad insediamenti urbani di piccola e media scala. I ricavi vengono sia dalla vendita (a minor costo), che dal dono o dal baratto: l'obiettivo non \u00e8 il guadagno degli unMonastarians, ma la creazione di valore condiviso con la comunit\u00e0 locale. La commercializzazione dei prodotti/servizi \u00e8 integrata alla strategia di replicazione: invece che comprare, altre comunit\u00e0 possono scegliere di accogliere l'unMonastery.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-04 09:12:29", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 03:52:30.751012", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 774, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27618, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4980, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Statistics are easy</b>\n\nPage view stats are easy.

Governments are at odds when it comes to making honest projections for societal well-being, in times of ageing populations and shrinking state budgets. Care systems are increasingly deemed unable to cater to the needs of tomorrow\u2019s elderly populations, many of whom are today\u2019s unemployed, migrants, or poor.\u00a0Good\u00a0stewards are aware of the state's failure to take care of certain public assets, and that is why they decide to take up this task. At Edgeryders after Lote4, we\u2019re starting to envision a system of care by a community of hackers, armed with cheap, open source tools, which would gather most promising bottom up solutions such as new types of care homes as intergenerational co-living spaces, open medical technologies as alternatives to the Internet of Things.\u00a0\n\nStewards are also trying to correct market failures, not only state's failure. The LOTE4 \u00a0debate explores why the market failures arise : because of\u00a0\"imperfect information\" according to JimmyTidey, or externalities according to Alberto, and how to correct them and how to overcome them. One possibility would be to use markets when they work well, and not to use them when they offer market failures. In this case a model based on stewardship would work much better. According to Matthias, it is futile to try to correct market failures with more inclusive pricing.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>The rise of the sharing economy and its limits:</strong></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSharing economy is a start, but communities should look beyond that and share other assets, such as ideas, resources, etc.\u00a0The boundaries between community sharing and commercial sharing are blurred, as shown by the experience of the industry titans AirBnb or Uber.\u00a0As an example of stewardship, the sharing economy is indeed creating social benefits, but its transactions go beyond cooperation and the staggering amount of personal data collected on platforms is powerful and to an extent threatening. Can newer collaborative environments, like swarm economies or non-monetary ones come up with fairer social contracts for their communities?\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Reflexions upon monetary transactions, it's underlying values, alternative systems of value exchange and reputation systems</strong></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSome of the stewards seem to be ready to give up the monetary transactions and use other means to obtain the things they need. There are alternative systems of value exchange that can provide a more sustainable option (crowdfunding, to abandoning monetary currency altogether, bartering, reputation systems).\u00a0 Money does not arrise because barter is complicated, but because reciprocity is complicated. Iamkat notices that, because there are many things for which we cannot directly barter, without money we need much stronger personal ties to foster enough trust for exchange. A perfect example of it would be MakerFox, a platform enabling network bartering. Perhaps we need to separate unhappiness with value/wealth distribution and the concept of money, says Robin Chase.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>The importance of overcoming the limits of technology in order to realize true stewardship</strong></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nTechnology is not always inclusive, thus creating digital platforms for stewardship might create actually the opposite effect than the one that it was initially thought for. Platform tend to become centralized and there is risk of members serving the platform and not the community. \u00a0Those wishing to help others learn to be stewards need to carefully balance their goal --removing barriers to entry by creating new platforms -- with the possibility of inadvertently imposing systems that create new barriers to entry, says Elivapw. This is why it is important to make the communication as independent as possible from any grid, acknowledges Nadia.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor this synthesis, posts and comments from the following Edgeryders were used: <a href=\"/u/teirdes\">@teirdes</a>, <a href=\"/u/nicobis\">@NicoBis</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"/u/bembo_davies\">@Bembo_Davies</a>, <a href=\"/u/steveclare\">@SteveClare</a>, <a href=\"/u/jimmytidey\">@jimmytidey</a>, <a href=\"/u/elviapw\">@elviapw</a>, <a href=\"/u/hkaplinsky\">@HKaplinsky</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>, <a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a>, <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>, <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYou can read the extractions and the full posts at the following <a href=\"http://discussions.bluenove.com/edgeryders#\">link</a>.\u00a0Next week we are going to publish a new synthesis of the LOTE4 discussion regarding stewardship case studies.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-14 13:46:52", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:40.593341", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 811, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 43, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-07-09 22:51:40.403766", "updated_at": "2017-07-09 22:51:40.403766", "deleted_at": "2017-07-09 22:59:39.852524", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2369, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2336, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Edgeryders Community\u00a0News:\n\n<h1>UNDP is launching a foresight exercise at the Edge modelled on Edgeryders. And you can be a part of it too!</h1>\n\n<strong>In 2000, world leaders promised to halve extreme poverty by 2015 with a global plan called the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)</strong>. The eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \u2013 which range from halving extreme poverty to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and providing universal primary education, all by the target date of 2015 \u2013 form a blueprint agreed to by all the world\u2019s countries and all the world\u2019s leading development institutions. <strong>As a follow-up to the first round of post 2015 consultation, UNDP is launching Spot the Future, a foresight exercise modelled on Edgeryders.</strong> There are two reasons for this.\n\nThe first is recognition of the need to bridge the\u00a0<strong>disconnect between the timeframe of development work, and the accelerating pace of change in a globalised world</strong>. Development programs take long time to get started so by time results come in, the work you are doing is out of date or worse, counter-productive. Edgeryders has successfully pioneered a novel citizen-engagement methodology that is traversal and versatile, reaches beyond formal processes and structures and is well suited to continuous multi-stakeholder dialogue.\n\nThe second is recognition that <strong>in complex societies, change tends to start at the edge.</strong> Individuals farther away from the mainstream are less shielded from systemic change (mass unemployment, ecological crises, etc.), and therefore harder pressed to respond and adapt to it; at the same time, they are also less constrained by \"business as usual\". We are seeing a lot of radical innovators at the edge of society active on Edgeryders and have solid blue sky thinkers in the Edgeryders community. They, and <strong>Edgeryders, are quoted as examples\u00a0in contexts such as the GSN summit </strong>and<strong> Foresight Program meetings at the UK Government of Science.</strong>\n\nIn the 21st century, <strong>the spread of hacker culture </strong>\u2013 with its emphasis on DIY, knowledge sharing and technological progress has turned on a spotlight on a small but influential minority of social innovators, activists and technologists that are emerging as<strong> a massive, distributed R&amp;D lab</strong> <strong>for the global society</strong>. There is much to be gained from a constructive dialog between the center, where business and governance policies are decided upon, and the edge, where people at the forefront of change and adaptation are gathering precious data on what change really looks like from the inside. However, bootstrapping and sustaining such dialog is challenging. Profoundly different world views and experiences separate policy makers and innovators at the edge; a history of mutual mistrust makes each side weary of engaging with the other. Edgeryders grows out of a joint Council of Europe/European Commission project to bridge this gulf. The approach we advocate \u2013 and that we have successfully deployed elsewhere \u2013 is based on three main activities:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>traversing the social graph</strong> to reach cutting-edge trends and their protagonists just as they happen.</li>\n\n<li><strong>peer-to-peer validation</strong> through a curated online conversation.</li>\n\n<li><strong>conversation harvesting</strong> through online ethnography and network analysis techniques.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe are designing and deploying the technical and social infrastructure appropriate for the exercise in several countries. Besides being a fast, cost-effective solution compatible with time and budget constraints, our approach has two added advantages.\n\nFirstly, unlike any existing national platform, it <strong>brings together innovators and hackers in any number of countries, maximizing the opportunities for interaction with each other</strong> and with many of their counterparts in different parts of the world.\n\nSecondly, it stays at arm\u2019s length from the client: you can make bold decisions, and live with their consequences. A partially separate identity lets the client take credit for the exercise\u2019s success if it succeeds, and yet shelters it from the fallout of failure should it fail. This means we can <strong>build a truly innovative prototype with no risk to compromise the client\u2019s credibility</strong>. We employed the same strategy with Edgeryders vs. the Council of Europe, Kublai vs. the Italian Ministry of economic development etc.\u00a0\n\n<span><strong>This spring we are launching the Edgeryders foresight exercise in several countries</strong>.\u00a0</span>A growing number of organisations are realising that <strong>if you do foresight the Edgeryders, way you are likely to catch important weak signals from the edges in a context that promotes trust and collaboration</strong> around ground-breaking projects such as the unMonastery. \u00a0If your organisation wishes to partner with [community member in same country as org#1], <span>[community member in same country as org</span><span>#2</span><span>]</span>\u00a0and other young community members in putting [country where organisation is based] on that map, we\u2019d love to hear from you!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-13 13:53:16", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:12.226265", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 864, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24281, "user_id": 129, "topic_id": 2046, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Graphics</b>\n\nReady to support as well!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-15 10:27:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.649010", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32969, "user_id": 1672, "topic_id": 2308, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>tanks [Matthias]</b>\n\nGreat I will do some cleanup on the files and upload them :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-02-07 15:02:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:00.905178", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22324, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 2953, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>ok</b>\n\nPlease let me know what to start with @saidhamideh.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-17 17:14:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:04.310284", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21305], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3166, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 3133, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Harissa, Khash, Khinkali, Badrijani, Kushari, Fatta,\u00a0K\u00f6ttbullar, Pannekoeken, Cl\u0103tite, Sauerkraut, Stoemp, Patatas Bravas, or a good ol' american (veggie?) burger!

It's something intimate and go beyond any language limit.

Rather, humans have an extremely long history of connection that very recently has become \"hyper.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8595506e395ac472a7d93d9fe66c843200a9c78f.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"><br>\n\nThe Cave of the Hands is 9000-year-old evidence of our quest for connection. The history of communication closely parallels technological developments: bone pipes used to spray paint to create the outlines of hands eventually brought us to touch screen technology used in the iPhone.\n\nWe have been hugely motivated to communicate messages, ideas, people, and products over distances. In the 20<sup>th</sup> century this resulted in great innovation especially in telecommunication and transportation. And, to risk a broad generalization, airplanes are largely responsible for my existence.\n\nMy mother is a Dane, my father is a Canadian-Brit, and they met in Guatemala. This is not a story that could have easily been told any time before the 20<sup>th</sup> century. It is also a story that is becoming increasingly common. When I was born I was given dual citizenship of Canada and Denmark. In the past, dual citizens were viewed with extreme skepticism as <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/dual-citizenship-age-mobility\">\"a potential catalyst for treason, espionage, and other subversive activities.\"</a>\u00a0It is a status today which is sometimes still regarded as somewhat questionable, though no longer treasonous. This is reflected in the sketchy statistics available about dual citizens: US estimates range between 500,000 and 5.7 million US dual citizens. The message is clear: stay quiet to avoid bureaucratic difficulties. Though dual citizenship is a reality, and a legal reality, the bureaucracies that created dual citizens often do not know how to handle them.\n\nApart from the dodgy bureaucratic side of dual-citizenship, it also allows great access to education, travel, work, and, for example, the opportunity for me to intern for the Commission.\n\nMy point so far has been to establish that humans are great communicators striving for ever faster, better, more frequent, and more numerous connections and this has already had an impact on the identity and culture of current generations. Enter: the Internet. This is what the \"hyper\" in hyperconnection is all about. The Internet has made the world spectacularly accessible to the largest proportion of people in the history of the planet, irrespective of citizenship. From entertainment, education, and travel to employment the Internet affects everything.\n\nIn 2013 I got an online job. Suitably enough, I found it through Facebook. I moonlight as a moderator for a popular online kid's game. The majority of what I do is encourage nice behaviour online and penalize users who swear or talk about sex.\n\nI work for a Danish company with headquarters in Copenhagen and Luxembourg. It is supported in 16 countries and I work on the six English speaking sites. I report daily to my manager who is located in New York. In the two years that I've had this job I have worked from seven countries in Europe and North America.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5ac103fac806ad3486c341d47d33afe7706e60b1.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"377\"><br>My office is my laptop. I can work anywhere with a Wi-Fi connection. For me, the portability has made it a spectacularly practical job. But in dealing with the interested bureaucratic authorities it is rather the opposite. The principle question is where do I pay taxes? Technically I am a registered Danish company so I pay income taxes in Denmark.\n\nBut is this an appropriate reflection of the situation? Tax season generally leaves me feeling uneasy largely because of the discrepancy I feel between the options I\u2019m given by the tax people and the realities of my job. It\u2019s worth considering that if taxes are used to pay for services where <em>should</em> I pay taxes? Where do I use services? Where am I contributing to society? Arguably I make more of a societal contribution through my work in Canada and the US than in Denmark. And currently I\u2019m living in Belgium. What\u2019s the difference between online society and countries defined by their geopolitical boundaries? The fact of the matter is current administrative systems can\u2019t, or don\u2019t want to, account for people who work online in potentially multiple countries and live in another.\n\nThe existence of highly mobile workers is a relatively new phenomenon but also likely to grow. Rethinking the appropriate response is something worth considering.\n\nWhere are you from? This seemingly benign question encompasses many more questions: Where were you born? Where did you grow up? Where did you go to school? Where do you work? Where do you live? Being able to answer this question simply is a victim of the hyperconnected world. But that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. We just need to figure out how we want to manage and respond to this situation as a hyperconnected society.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-23 15:15:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:24.472735", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1060, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 20.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4467, "user_id": 2636, "topic_id": 4434, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**_Available in: :gb: [English](#en) / [Romanian](#ro)_**\n\n----------\n## :gb: **_English version_** <a name=\"en\"></a>\n\nDear EdgeRyders,\n\nMy name is Alina and I'm 20 years old. I come from Bucharest, but I left Romania when I was 18 to study abroad. I am currently studying Leisure Management in the Netherlands, Breda, and I have chosen this programme because of its problem-based, highly applied approach, but also because I believe in the power of leisure activities as ways of fostering and provoking social innovation and change. Subjects covered by my university were imagineering, project management, marketing, research, operational management and strategic network design, and they have all been taught by means of different projects commissioned by real-life companies from both the public and the private sector. \n\nDuring the second year of university, I did a seven months internship at Artconnect Berlin, a company created to empower creative individuals and to stimulate the creative community of Berlin to work together for the benefits of all parts involved. My main tasks there were social media, public relations and blogging. Moreover, I had to develop a growth strategy based on gamification and a marketing plan for an online marketplace. Even though communities and networks have always been a recurrent element in my curriculum, my internship experience was truly eye-opening in a sense of seeing the power that communities can gain once they are offered a platform on which to interact and mingle with each other. \n\nNext year will be my third and final study year, and I have opted for a specialisation in creative industries, because I find it a challenging and highly interesting area of expertise, which very much comes in line with my own personality and character, as I have always been a very creative and perceptive person, while at the same time very structured and analytical. The minor will be focused on the way creative industries can act as drivers for social innovation. After I will have also written my thesis (for which one of my possible topics would actually be the participation of Bucharest in the competition to become the European Cultural capital in 2021), I would like to spend 2 years in gaining some more professional experience, and afterwards come back to Bucharest and to try to bring the knowledge I have acquired abroad and my enthusiasm back there. \n\nI truly believe that offering a platform where individuals can come together and co-create towards a joint objective can give birth to powerful communities which could have an important say in relation to future societal developments. However, I think, on the basis of my internship, that the most difficult part about creating online collaborative communities is not to help them grow up, but to make them become independent and no longer in need of support. Differently said, to get to the point where users use the platform intrinsically, because they see it as a tool that really comes and supports the development of their own needs and ideas.\n\nI would love to continue working with this sort of communities, to learn how to stimulate collaboration better and ultimately to help in any way I can. I would still very much like to stay connected to Bucharest, as I have always had as main objective to come back there after finishing my studies and to try to contribute to its transformation towards a smart, innovative city. \n\nBesides my professional side, I am very passionate about technology and the way it influences societies. I am an avid user of social media, and I use it to gather information about different topics or to provoke discussion about themes that are of interest to me. I spend between 1 and 5 hours daily reading articles, forums and different information sources, so I come in contact with a lot of different content each day. I am very open-minded and accepting, and I love meeting and interacting with people in all their diversity and uniqueness.\n\nThis being said, I have found this job offer as I was looking for a summer job, at the recommendation of a friend. Having considered what I have mentioned above, I found it a perfect match with everything I wanted to work on and potentially even more, as I have also always wanted to get involved with the organising and the managing of different events. I am extremely interested in the concept of EdgeRyders and would be highly motivated to bring everything I can to help this project grow and develop in Bucharest.\n\nIf I were to name projects or people who actively participate in changing communities, I would choose Carusel (an organisation dealing with harm reduction which works with marginalised groups in Romania), Centrul National al Dansului Bucuresti (a centre which has been struggling for years with very little public sector support to create an alternative and experimental space for dance), MIRA Rehab (a Romanian initiative to make physical therapy fun through video games) and Funky Citizens (an active citizenship organisation with many interesting initiatives started at the moment). I could obtain a personal contact form the first two through personal contacts, but for the other two I would write a short, informative yet attractive email, follow it by a phone call few days after and finally through a personal contact. I think that all of these organisation have visions and identities which could very much fit with the one of EdgeRyders, and I am sure that all of these initiatives are looking for as much support and help as they can. Because my personal beliefs and convictions are very much in line with the whole concept of this project, I would be an enthusiastic and passionate driver of this idea towards other organisations and people. \n\nI would be very happy to hear from you and to have a talk on how and what I could bring to your organisation. Right now I am still in the Netherlands, finishing my school year, but I will come to Bucharest at the end of June. However, I would still be open to start working for this wonderful project as soon as needed, even from the distance. If you have any questions or uncertainties about my application please contact me any time via my email, [alina.tomescu10@gmail.com](mailto:alina.tomescu10@gmail.com) or through my account here on EdgeRyders. \n\nThank you,\n\nAlina Tomescu.\n\n----------\n##_Romanian version_<a name=\"ro\"></a> \n\nDragi EdgeRyders,\n\nNumele meu este Alina si am 20 de ani. Sunt din Bucuresti, dar am plecat din Romania cand aveam 18 ani pentru a studia in afara. Momentan studiez managementul activitatilor de timp liber (Leisure Management) in Breda, Olanda, si am ales specializarea aceasta pentru orientarea practica pe care o ofera ca metoda de educatie, dar si pentru ca cred in folosirea activitatilor de timp liber ca metoda de a stimula inovatia sociala si schimbarea de mentalitate colectiva. Cursurile principale oferite de NHTV Breda sunt imagineering, project management, marketing, research, operational management si strategic network design, iar toate aceste cunostinte teoretice au fost aplicate practic in proiecte comandate de diferite entitati reale, din domeniul public sau privat. \n\nIn anul doi de facultate am facut un internship de sapte luni la Artconnect Berlin, o companie creata pentru a oferi mai multa independenta si putere persoanelor creative si pentru a le stimula sa lucreze impreuna in baza unei comunitati. Principalele mele sarcini au fost social media, public relations si blogging. In plus, am avut de dezvoltat o strategie de crestere a numarului de utilizatori bazata pe gamification \u0219i un plan de marketing pentru un marketplace in mediul online. Chiar daca comunitatile si sistemele de tip network au fost niste subiecte recurente in curriculumul scolar pe toata durata facultatii, experienta acestui internship la Artconnect Berlin mi-a oferit o perspectiva mai clara si mai practica asupra diferitelor procese din viata reala, in sensul ca am putut vedea cum, oferind o platforma unde oamenii se pot intalni si cunoaste unul pe celalalt, se pot forma comunitati puternice care sa conduca la schimbare.\n\nAnul viitor va fi ultimul meu an de facultate, in care am optat catre o specializare in industrii creative, pentru ca mi se pare un domeniu foarte interesant si provocator, care se leaga foarte bine cu personalitatea mea, deoarece am fost dintotdeauna o persoana foarte creativa si perspicace, dar foarte structurata si analitica in acelasi timp. Specializarea aceasta va fi bazata pe modurile in care industriile creative pot actiona ca vectori de schimbare pentru inovatie sociala. Dupa specializare imi voi scrie teza de licenta (unde una dintre temele posibile este chiar participarea Bucurestiului in cursa pentru capitala culturala europeana in 2021), iar apoi as vrea sa mai lucrez timp de un an sau doi ca sa castig mai multa experienta profesionala, dupa care as vrea sa ma intorc in Bucuresti si sa incerc sa aduc toate cunostintele pe care le-am dobandit in strainatate si entuziasmul meu inapoi acolo. \n\nCred foarte mult in crearea de platforme sociale unde indivizii pot gasi sprijin si idei similare spre a co-crea si a face posibile obiective comune. Cred ca, cu ajutorul unei comunitati puternice, ideile bune pot gasi mai mult suport si expunere pentru a putea fi puse in aplicare si pentru a dezvolta societatea viitorului. Cu toate acestea, bazandu-ma pe experienta internshipului meu, cred ca cea mai mare provocare in domeniul crearii unei comunitati online este de a le ajuta sa devina independente. Altfel spus, de a ajunge in punctul in care utilizatorii folosesc platforma ca un mediu care vine in ajutorul idelor lor si care ii ajuta sa se dezvolte, fara a mai necesita stimuli externi. \n\nMi-ar placea sa continui sa lucrez cu comunitati de acest fel ca sa invat mai multe despre metode de stimulare a caracterului independent in retele, dar si ca sa incerc sa ajut idei in care cred sa creasca. De asemenea, mi-as dori foarte mult sa raman conectata cu Bucuresti, deoarece obiectivul meu a fost dintotdeauna sa imi termin studiile si sa ma intorc sa contribui la transformarea acestui oras intr-un loc destept si inovator.\n\nPe langa obiectivele profesionale, sunt foarte pasionata in timpul liber de tehnologie de varf si de felul in care afecteaza societatea in care traim. Sunt un utilizator avid de social media si folosesc mediul online pentru a aduna diverse informatii din diferite medii, dar si pentru a provoca discutii vis-a-vis de diferite domenii de interes personal. In medie, folosesc de la 1 pana la 5 ore pe zi pentru a citi diverse articole sau forumuri, ceea ce inseamna ca intru in contact cu foarte mult continut in fiecare zi, pe care il folosesc pentru a lansa discutii sau pentru a ma dezvolta personal. Sunt o persoana foarte deschisa, si imi place sa cunosc si sa interactionez cu multe tipuri de oameni cu diverse interese si domenii de activitate. \n\nAcestea fiind spuse, am gasit acest anunt prin recomandarea unui prieten, in timp ce cautam un job pentru la vara. Luand in considerare tot ce am mentionat mai sus, cred ca este o oprtunitate ideala pentru mine ca sa invat tot ce mi-am propus si chiar mai mult, deoarece mi-as dori sa ma implic de asemenea in organizarea unui eveniment pentru a experimenta cu acest domeniu de activitate. Sunt extrem de interesata de tot conceptul din spatele EdgeRyders si sunt foarte motivata sa aduc tot ce imi sta in putere pentru a ajuta acest proiect sa se dezvolte in Bucuresti.  \n\nDaca ar trebui sa numesc niste proiecte care s-ar potivi cu conceptul EdgeRyders, as alege Carusel (o organizatie bazate pe harm reduction care lucreaza cu comunitati defavorizate din Romania), Centrul National al Dansului Bucuresti (un centru cu o viziune inovatoare care se lupta de ani de zile sa creeze un spatiu dedicat experimentarii si dansului, dar cu putin sprijin sau fonduri), MIRA Rehab (o initiativa romaneasca de a transforma terapia fizica intr-o activitate distrativa cu ajutorul jocurilor video) si Funky Citizens (o organizatie bazata pe activism social cu foarte multe initiative interesante). As putea obtine contact direct cu primele doua organizatii prin contacte personale, iar pentru celelalte as incepe prin a scrie un mail informativ dar atractiv, si as continua printr-o convorbire telefonica si un contact personal. Cred ca toate aceste organizatii mentionate mai sus au identitati si viziuni foarte similare cu cele ale EdgeRyder, iar de aceea cred ca nu ar fi foarte greu sa fie aduse impreuna. Deoarece cred in valorile promovate de EdgeRyder si de acest proiect, as fi extrem de pasionata si de entuziasmata sa fac parte din acest concept si sa ajut la formarea si conectarea acestor parti. \n\nMi-ar placea foarte mult sa ajut aceasta organizatie si sa lucrez pe durata verii cu acest concept. Momentan ma aflu inca in Olanda, unde trebuie sa imi termin cel de-al doilea an de facultate. Desi voi veni in Bucuresti abia la sfarsitul lui Iunie, mi-ar face placere sa sa ajut oricand este nevoie. Daca aveti orice fel de intrebari sau nedumeriri despre aceasta aplicatie va rog sa ma contactati pe adresa de email alina.tomescu10@gmail.com sau pe contul creat aici pe EdgeRyders. \n\nVa multumesc,\n\nAlina Tomescu", "created_at": "2015-05-22 13:19:39", "updated_at": "2018-04-02 15:57:48.092177", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2206, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 26.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4443, "user_id": 2603, "topic_id": 4410, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello! Nice to meet you all here online! Congratulations for the initiative. Bucharest is a stream for inspiration and life stories and this kind of projects can bring it more to life, especially in summer time when people are more optimistic and think more profoundly about change-making. (personal opinion :) )\n\nI do Sales &amp; Marketing for a sales training company here in Bucharest and my favorite part of the job is organizing events, educational, networking and for entertainment. In two years we have started building our own community of sales professionals and it is amazing to see how engaged they are and always looking forward to see what new events we create. The best part is of course the relationships developed between the members and the joy they have to see one another at the events. When you create a community and you find the glue that sticks everyone together, it is simply an amazing feeling and all you want is to create more and more events!\n\nI am very passionate about community projects therefore I am part of two NGO\u2019s, Rotaract Bucharest and Intercultura Romania, and also student at the only Alternative University in Romania. Rotaract Bucharest is an NGO that commits to creating events and project to support the growth and development of the community. The projects are mainly addressed to orphan children, elderly people and young talented artists in distress. Intercultura Romania is part of the International AFS Organization that provides learning opportunities for students in high-school emphasizing on personal development through intercultural learning and cross cultural encounters.\n\nThe most difficult part of my job is coordinating people I guess, it is of course a constant battle between the fast way and the democratic way. I enjoy working in teams and creating concepts together in groups, brainstorming and exchanging ideas. What is always a cross point is \u2018it\u2019s this the right way or not?\u2019, or \u2018will this create engagement or not\u2019. However it is very fun and entertaining to create concepts and analyze the results afterwards. :) The more we try the more we learn.\n\nSpot the Future community is valuable for Bucharest in this era of change and need of individuals for personal and professional expression. It is important to have a hub of information about fantastic projects that happen around us. Many things are happening in Bucharest and it\u2019s difficult to follow all the projects/people, however, not impossible J \u00a0People should be more aware about opportunities and share ideas, create, enjoy. Three projects that I believe are change makers are: The Alternative University, Habitat for Humanity and Cristian Lupsa, the editor of \u2018<em>Decat o Revista\u2019</em>. These are examples of projects that really have impact and empower the people and make them be heard. \u00a0I enjoy listening to stories of life, people that have achieved great things. It\u2019s wonderful to share the stories, to inspire and get inspired.\n\nI am very much looking forward to meeting you :)\n\nHave an awesome day,\n\nCatalina\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-17 20:26:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:24.920856", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 521, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30886, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 693, "post_number": 22, "raw": "<b>The limits to participation</b>\n\nThanks for chipping in, @mariam1313 !\u00a0\n\nLike you, I am interested in participation. My own work has been about ways that the Internet can enable more effective forms of participatory democracy. I even wrote <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/wikicrazia/\">a book</a> about this. My point of departure was that participation as we inherited it from the 20th has not made a substantial impact on decision quality or societal cohesion, at least not in Italy, not even in the best cases. There are many reasons why this happens. Some of them:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Participatory processes are designed by civil servants, with other civil servants and \"usual suspect\" stakeholders</strong> (like professional business and trade union representatives)\u00a0<strong>in mind</strong>. In your rural development example, I see that they worked through offline meetings, convened in cities and on weekdays at 11.00 am. That choice is going to prevent the most interesting potential participants (the local entrepreneur, the teacher, the parent of small children...) from showing up. People who reliably do show up are the people paid to participate, like representatives and lobbyists... but those already have channels to talk to the government. The other option would be to convene during the evenings, but, at least in Italy, civil servants do not like this at all. The option is almost never even discussed. So, most of the collective brainpower is ruled out before the process even starts.</li>\n\n<li><strong>The \"technology of participation\" (the town hall meeting) is non-scalable</strong>. This means (a) every participant\u00a0will spend most of her\u00a0time being talked to and (b) people will need to keep any intervention short. This means there is no time to explore issues and scenarios. This is why I like so much online forums like Edgeryders: you can participate in your own time (when you are off work, when your children are asleep...); take time to make your case; and no one is forced to be reading anyone else. We\u00a0<em>choose</em>\u00a0to engage with contributions we find interesting.</li>\n\n<li><strong>The social contract underpinning participation is often not clear.</strong> I participate, then what? What we suggest gets implemented? What we suggest gets considered? How do I know decisions have not been made beforehands, and the decision maker ris just looking for a rubberstamp? Recent example: after an online and offline consultation with 1.8\u00a0<em>million</em>\u00a0participants on Italian schools, number 1 request that emerged was to have teachers evaluated by independent experts, and not by their own headmasters. The government, nevertheless, decided to reject that request. Assuming the average participants spent two hours participating (very conservative assumption), that means the waste of 3.6 million hours. In European standards (1,732 productive hours in a year), that the equivalent of about\u00a02,000 years of human work. Not cool. The social contract issue is the easiest one to fix.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI have recently been involved in contributing to Italy's 3rd action plan under the Open Government Partnership (as an activist, unpaid). My brothers-and-sisters-in-arms and myself made these points quite forcefully, and they have been adopted by the government. Here's to hoping for better times. :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-22 11:45:33", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:52.575039", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 562, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30612], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25014, "user_id": 31, "topic_id": 1662, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>numbers, negotiation, provocation and movement</b>\n\n<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/arthur-doohan\">Arthur</a> wrote a comment saying 75% reduction may be [my phrasing] (a) too much for most of us to wrap our heads around, and (b) maybe more than what's needed to bring a system to its knees.\n\nThe number itself carries no direct meaning, because the situations are messy in real life. Messy along time and space and person, because at first it's 5% here, 10% there - then it get worse but people say it's soon going to get better - and of course some people get a worse deal than others.\n\nIf we forget the number, we can look at the \"quality\" of the situation: is the decrease in funding <u>deep enough</u> to make us change the way we do things? An individual example: Let's say my heart is weak but not too weak, so I can walk to the food shop which is 2 km away. Maybe a 5% decrease in my heart's strength will force me to take the bus instead of walking, or ask for someone else to do the shopping for me.\n\nSo, yes, I believe it's a very helpful comment, Arthur!\n\nWe cannot <u>negotiate</u> with the reality (country, income, health, networks) we <u>start</u> from. That's a given.\n\nBut in this <strong>exercise</strong> we want to think about changes, and we have the luxury of defining our own numbers.\n\nOne way to think about changes is to try and imagine that the situation is bad enough, whatever that is. This, in <em>lateral thinking</em> terms, is what's called <u>\"provocation\"</u> (a conciously applied exercise in breaking our previous ways of solving problems, splitting the puzzle into individual pieces, or whatever way you like to think about it). For me, a 75% cut is a provocation. For others, it may be enough to think of a 20%, or in some systems even a 5% decrease. Whatever works for you!\n\nOnce we imagine that, we can start to think of many small changes, here and there. A zillion small changes, or maybe a few big but doable ones. This is what's called <u>\"movement\"</u>: finding another path through the maze, either by breaking walls, or by building bridges, or by defining better goals, or whatever. You progress from the provocation, to the hint of an idea, to a concept that smells good, to an idea that might work, to something that might be tested in real life ...\n\nSome do that by finding hidden treasures (the unused power of networks was a blast for me, and some talk about \"Assets Based Community Developement\" etc). Others by looking at what others have done in the past (<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/user/user_profile/james-hester\">\"applied history\"</a>). Or by thinking very slowly: go through the way you do things like you would drive a bike inch by inch, so that you have time to discover useful turns that you'd normally pass by in a rush. Or, again, whatever works for you. And of course you can use all of them as <em>tools</em>, in turns, alone or with others, just for the productive fun of it!\n\nOthers use new perception frameworks, tools to look at things in a different way. I saw that just yesterday. We were <a href=\"http://imaginethecanaries.blogspot.com.es/2011/09/why-i-love-scim-and-what-to-do-about-it.html\">looking at the levels</a> by which medication comes to the individual: from international to country to region (warehouse) to pharmacy to home. The present situation is one of \"just in time\": globalisation kinda works for some of us, and the flow of goods is fast and uninterrupted. So, in the event of a temporary interruption, you want some \"stocks\" to make up for the loss in \"flow\". We could then think about what level to use for stocks, etc.\n\nIn short: for old situations we make use of our memory. For new situations, we need serious &amp; applied creativity. This exactly is what I meant by \"it was fun &amp; we're good at it\" when we presented at the \"general assembly\" on Friday 14th.\n\nNumbers? Ok, shrug, let's just use them as a tool.

I'd still like try it out\u00a0when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nIt's an interesting remark on the authority of health practitioners @steelweaver and @Noemi . I think the reliance on\u00a0guidance by an expert\u00a0is in large part\u00a0the result of the patients\u00a0not being as familiar with acupuncture\u00a0as the expert. Yet patients\u00a0are there for a reason: at some level, they believe in\u00a0the positive potential of the treatment. This common\u00a0belief of both parties is the base for authority and\u00a0lends you, or the practitioner, as an expert the authority to give direction. Authority governs the interaction and when nobody (or nothing) assumes it, confusion arises. To be clear:\u00a0authority is different from power.\n\nI can complement this with my personal experience in the standard healthcare system in Belgium. For a little over 5 years I had a series of serious physical afflictions, which didn't ever seem to heal or resolve themselves and only got worse over the years. At the start I always\u00a0left the clinic with a smile, which\u00a0always disappeared in days, weeks or months as the situation deteriorated again. I experienced first hand that I was just\u00a0a number, and that treating symptoms is faster and\u00a0easier. Good thing for pharma companies, because endlessly treating symptoms sells more drugs.\u00a0Finding the real cause takes longer, is harder and is more expensive, at least in the short term.\n\nI got pretty skeptical about the system by going from doctor to doctor and spending more time in physiotherapy than with my friends or family. Gradually I lost belief in the system. It was\u00a0after I ultimately found the cause and cure (very simple ones at that) that whatever remained\u00a0of my belief vanished.\u00a0With that\u00a0gone, there was no more common belief between me and the doctor, so the authority vanished. My language can't hide\u00a0it: I found the\u00a0solution, not a doctor or a system.\u00a0For this specific\u00a0illness, I will not lend authority very easily anymore either.\u00a0I'm lucky, as I have a general idea of healthcare through my studies\u00a0and know my body well by now, but this is clearly problematic for the general population when you hear similar stories with unhappy endings.\n\nAlso interesting that (at least for me) a big part of the authority of the health practitioner is due to belief in the system, rather than a belief in the knowledge of the doctor (which I never really doubted).\u00a0I think that might be a western thing, linked to what\u00a0surfaced in the discussions with @alkasem23 about <a href=\"/t/how-cultural-differences-can-make-us-understand-our-flaws-in-the-care-sector-better/757\">differences in care with Syria</a>:\u00a0in the west we put our trust in and rely on systems rather than other people. In some\u00a0other cultures,\u00a0people probably put their belief mainly in a person, the doctor.\n\nEasier interactions through\u00a0the internet,\u00a0powerful search engines,\u00a0a lot of people sharing experience and stories online, easy access to second opinions (in my country anyway)... Though they don't\u00a0always provide\u00a0correct information, these factors also\u00a0lead people to challenge the authority in terms of knowledge\u00a0of the practitioner in the classical doctor's office. I\u00a0think both this challenging of knowledge and the failure of the system will inevitably lead to some fundamental changes in healthcare.\n\nImportantly, authority cannot simply disappear, the common belief has to shift to something else. Most stories of\u00a0experimentation with new methods in the stories here on Edgeryders\u00a0share some sort of\u00a0community aspect. This\u00a0illustrates a shift to lending authority to a\u00a0collective rather than a system or a person. The\u00a0collective can consist\u00a0of patients, doctors or other caregivers and is likely\u00a0a mixture ideally. In Syria the collective is mainly the family, according to Alkasem.\n\nLooking through this lens\u00a0of authority\u00a0is interesting and can be applied to many aspects of our\u00a0daily lives.\u00a0The matter is fresh in my head from <a href=\"http://paulverhaeghe.psychoanalysis.be/boeken.html\">a Dutch book</a> I just finished reading, which I hope\u00a0gets translated\u00a0to English. If anyone is interested:\u00a0the book builds on work by Hannah Arendt that\u00a0you can certainly find :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-06 23:18:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:44.734090", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 816, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [18496], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23162, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 639, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Different online cultures...</b>\n\nThat's very informative, @jdossou80@yahoo.com, thanks.\u00a0\n\nIt seems that in the USA and Europe there is a \"middle generation\": people that got on the Internet when it was still relatively new, let's say before 2006. Those people managed to see the tail end of the noncommercial Internet; and they remember what it means for using a website to to be \"hard\": slow dialup connections, textual interfaces, floppy disks with vintage browsers like Mosaic and Netscape.

It was totally efficient.</em>\n\nand\n\n<em>Either I want to be immersed in the web and seeking help from others out there online, or immersed in a culture and a place. The classroom doesn't really provide either of these immersive possibilities.</em>\n\n\"Being held back by a group\" is a very well known problem with classroom education. Teachers have to strike the right balance, catering to the middle part of the slow learner-fast learner frequency distribution and leaving the very slow and very fast to sort themselves out. (I absolutely hated school as a little boy (age 6-10) because I was fast and found it boring. I complained so much that my parents had me skip one year at age 10, and then it got better - but not for long. I could only really breathe when I finally got to university.) No surprise there.\n\nThe surprise is that people rave about social contact in the classroom environment, whereas you (and I - <a href=\"/t/test-driving-the-khan-academy-how-i-learned-to-use-conditional-probabilities-and-combination/1360\">I have played this mission too</a>) don't think much of it. To me, it feels very much like people that used to say things like \"Online papers are never going to take off! You can't have your morning coffee while staring at a computer screen!\" or \"E-books are just not the same as smelling the paper of a newly bough book.\" We all know how those went. And yet, the people making these point believed, in perfectly good faith, that they were being sensible, reasonable, wise. But they were not: they were suffering from a completely irrational conservative bias, a preference for the status quo.\n\nI suspect this might be a common problem facing reformers. If, suppose, European policy makers were to attempt a reform on education, I suspect that they would know that the classroom model arose as a function of technological constraints that are no longer there. \"Know\" as in \"we have done the science, and it is proven\". And yet, it must be exhausting to engage Joe Sixpack, day in day out, that thinks any deviation from the system he has grown up in (and probably hated at the time) is dangerous, radical and starry-eyed.\u00a0 Why are we biased in favour of the status quo?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-19 09:43:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:22.608014", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 476, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31758, "user_id": 3010, "topic_id": 4974, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>sure, keep me posted!\n\n</b>\n\nsure, keep me posted!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-20 17:20:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:54.544305", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31700], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24400, "user_id": 83, "topic_id": 1641, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>PressRelease:YOUNG PEOPLE FROM EUROPE&amp;BEYOND EXPRESS SOLIDARITY</b>\n\nPRESS RELEASE 17 / 06 / 2012\n\n<strong style=\"\"><span>PLACE D\u2019ATHENES, STRASBOURG:</span></strong>\n\n<strong style=\"\"><span>YOUNG PEOPLE FROM EUROPE AND BEYOND EXPRESS THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH PEOPLE LIVING IN GREECE</span></strong>\n\n<span>CONTACT: On twitter: @peterpannier, @ecolabs (people living in the UK) and @socialuna (a person living in Greece) for further information.

We are all in the same boat; to prosper we must work together to expose the real causes of this crisis\u201d. </span>\n\n<span>Other participants from across Europe specifically addressed tensions between the Greek and German governments \u2013 \u201cIch bin ein Grieche\u201d read one sign.</span>\n\n<span>Meanwhile, others criticised the economic policies of the EU, IMF and many European governments (\u201cAgainst Austerity Everywhere\u201d) and drew attention to the experience of other countries in tackling economic and financial crisis (\u201cIceland - \u221a, Ireland \u2013 X, Greece \u2013 X; Austerity NO, Honesty YES\u201d , and called for legal action against bankers: \u201cGreece: Put the bankers in Jail (like Iceland!)\u201d</span>\n\n<span>But the main message was support for the people living in Greece: \u201cSolidarity with people in Greece\u201d was written in English, Greek, Spanish, Italian, French, Polish and Russian.</span>\n\n<span>One of the young people who took part concluded the gathering by saying \u201cToday we express our solidarity through photo messages to the people of Greece, and by coming together as people in other cities are doing. Tomorrow, and in the future, we will show our solidarity in other ways, by travelling to Greece, by sending material support, and by taking action in our own localities \u2013 We Are All Greek!\u201d betta.cangelosi@gmail.com</span>\n\n<span>CONTACT: On twitter: @peterpannier, @ecolabs (people living in the UK) and @socialuna (a person living in Greece) for further information.

Over 50 people, creativity, views, actions, pizza, sticky notes, markers, computers, papers, stress, excitement, no sleep and of course a lot of energy drinks represented the controlled chaos during the 36 social hackathon hours.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/SAM_3787_1.JPG\" style=\"height: 250px; width: 370px;\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/SAM_3725_1.JPG\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 233px;\"> \n\nDuring the event I had multiple roles, being the organizer, the Edgeryders person on the spot and the emotional support for the participating teams. This event was a very unique and exciting experience for me because it brought different people from different sphere under one roof; social innovators, officials, ambassadors, civil society activist, business owners, and technical guys. It\u2019s too early to discuss the long-term impact this event will have, but I can say that this event accomplished something that I have tried to reach so hard in Belarus: Collaboration and to Show to all people/institutions that can make a difference; that social innovation is happening right in the centre of the society. With the Hack4SocialChange UNDP developed a platform where young people can create and innovative solutions for problems in Belarus AND created a possibility for these solution to be heard by people that can support them in realizing these solutions.\n\nThe three winners of Hack4SocialChange will be able in cooperation with UNDP implement their ideas. So who are the big winners of this social Hackathon? The winners in the category of Health are called \u2018be friends\u2019 and these guys build in 36 hours a prototype of a mobile application that will be used to fight the stereotypical thoughts about HIV. So basically this app is a game and a test at the same time that will teach you most basic knowledge about HIV and what you can and cannot believe about it. The 2 winners (yes the jury had a hard time to select only one) in the second category of Environmental protection are Greenmaps and Bottle hunter. Greenmaps basically maps all the ecological points in Belarus, from where you can bring your old clothing to where you can buy biological food. Bottle hunter is an application that scans your plastic bottles using the barcode that is on it and by doing this people collect points.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a950cc84d4ea6cf7be2853f75df4e8b6096f1e4d.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br> \n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b39fa0991b2b3186950303473eecaaad4f5dbe17.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n\nBottle hunter\u2019s idea was initiated by a doctor with a PHD in philosophy called Vitaly. During the pre-meet up we were a bit anxious about how Vitaly would    work on building his rather technical idea by himself. But then he got help from a very cool guy called Sergey, who basically gathered a team of IT guys and formed a great team together with Vitaly that worked together on developing the mobile scanner.\n\nI have made several new contacts with change makers and will write about them in my upcoming blogs. For now I want to finish by saying that I am on a very good track with the social innovation map, people that I am blogging about initiate local communities in different areas representing different levels of society: people with disabilities, local sports communities, entrepreneurs communities, IT communities and many more. Soon I will publish the Social innovators map and their communities!\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b60da04366c17faad33c5ed6838a62008eb9abd0.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>

Been busy here in Matera :). Being here in Matera has strongly influenced how I see the Viral Academy project proceeding, and this update is about how the experience here has helped inform the changes we are making. In the coming days two new team members will be joining us and we will announce an exciting collaboration with organisations here in Matera. We will be making regular posts from now on regarding the progress of the project - so please drop us a line with any comments or criticisms. It all helps.\n\nThere are essentially two main ways in which the project has changed due to this experience:\u00a0the first is the need and relevance of working without internet, and the second is the importance of broadening the scope of the teaching away from pure coding and app making to a much wider range of projects.\n\nWith regard to the lack of internet this was perhaps forced on us by having such intermittent connectivity at the unMonastery (the internet was frequently out for 2 days at a time), but also by the realisation that it would be wrong to restrict the project to an internet only audience. This is not only because this would restrict the audience (the online only audience is enough of a target), nor because of some old-fashioned conception of the \"digital divide\" - but rather because it makes the project less exciting to a younger audience, and because the Viral Academy mechanism applies equally strongly to physical and non-technical training situations. Simply put the project suffers by limiting it's scope to online technology.\u00a0\n\nThe focus on <strong>project based work </strong>remains, and is also strengthened by this experience. I've seen the lack of traction gained by trying to attract people to pure coding courses despite the best efforts of the all of us involved helping the Open Tech School, and I've seen how we generate far more attention by working with real world projects - whatever there nature - aquaponics, zero waste, martial arts - because nowadays the realisation of any innovation involves in some way or other an element of technology.\n\nThis brings me to the idea - always present in the Viral Academy project plan of working with music, radio, video and public events or festivals. My background or a good part of it is as an artist, director and community event organiser, in interactive theatre, club installations, and well parties of one form or another, and it has always been second nature to incorporate technology into these events. Now with the Viral Academy project we've found a great way to make \"technology more relevant and exciting\" by linking it to festivals, events, and public presentations, and we really look forward to working with events here in Matera.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-20 19:40:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:15.326164", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 493, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13502, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 517, "post_number": 18, "raw": "I have sent you an email.\n\nI would suggest you remove your email address from the post above to protect your security\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-10 17:14:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:16.371072", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13501], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22448, "user_id": 3310, "topic_id": 6059, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Biopolitics and health as a common</b>\n\nDear @Yannick, yes!

I am sure that many participants will identify with this too.\n\nHow do you know what is the right choice for you? What guides you? Intuition?\n\nAre you aware that I proposed, here, at Edgeryders, a model of human being, based on what you said? But the goal that you pursue, <em>Seek perfection of character</em>, has already been achieved by my ideal Man. I call it the 'Luminous Man' (see Michel Filippi, <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/shine-some-light/mission_case/des-hommes-et-de-notre-civilisation\">Des hommes et de notre Civilisation</a>). It is a model of human being, setting aside what we previously believed to be limitations to mental achievements. This model is based on the hypothesis that there is a blueprint of evolution of mankind, and this blueprint is stamped on our brain and rest of the body. We need only to learn how to read it in order to design our institutions and lifestyles, to conform to the demands of evolution.\n\nI have done, here at Edgeryders, since last November, a lot of thinking and exploring with the help of philosopher Michel Filippi.\n\nBut I've come to the point that I would need a different theory of the nature of the universe, to continue working on this model. Or maybe not, but that's rather complicated for my neurons, and I'd need some help to figure this out.\n\nAlso, the applications of this model of more evolved Man, ie what it would mean for business and organisation systems of society, this analysis work has not been conducted yet.\n\nAt its root, it implies a totally different view of the nature of life and the relationship between matter and consciousness. Science has imposed a limitation on itself, studying only the phenomenal world \u2013 that which can be measured empirically with the senses or recording instruments, and verified consistently through experimentation. This limitation of science has deprived us of the authority to make statements about possible non-physical aspects of creation.\n\nWhat needs to be done, for this new model of human being to become eventually accepted and even applied to many spheres of society, is not to invalidate the current scientific theories, but find ways of showing that these are a subset of a higher relativistic order. I want to <strong>seek ways for the two conflicting world views to merge into a new one that is superior to both</strong>. Get it?\n\nThis idea could be something that applies to all Edgeryders experiences: not rejecting the current order of the world (focus only on materialistic views and lifestyles), but add to it.\n\nSo...

My generation was not taught to share, unless it was within the family, with your siblings. On the contrary, there was a strong emphasis on individual enjoyment of resources. Learning? At school you would be evaluated individually, and explicitly forbidden to collaborate with others on assignments and tests, a practice called \u201ccheating\u201d by teachers. Work? You would apply for jobs, individually. You would receive a salary in return for participating in a hierarchical command-and-control structure, the whole point of which is that you are a cog in the machine, and as such you have nothing you could possibly share. Housing? You should aspire to a nice apartment for yourself and your family, in which you would share with your neighbours only the staircase. If you were more affluent, even better: you were encouraged to go for an independent house, with your own fenced garden and no sharing at all.\n\nThis left only two arenas: science and the Internet.\n\nI had the good fortune to do science (economics) in the early 90s. I now realize there were contradictions about sharing in academia: you would publish results, but not necessarily raw data (unless it was needed for referees to review your work). You wanted your work to be widely spread, yet publications would be copyrighted by default. But what struck me at the time is that anybody agreed that there was no way that even the most brilliant mind would achieve anything without leaning heavily on the work of others. It was natural to think of knowledge as a big heap of thinking and results. Everybody took freely from it and gave back to it. Everybody, that is, save the very top people: the pinnacle of scientific success was still Craig Venter, heavily funded by corporate finance, sitting on a big pile of proprietary genomic data and using them to churn out patent (privatized knowledge again) for Big Pharma.\n\nThe Internet taught me the bounty that can result from sharing with strangers. It started opening up my band\u2019s website to unmoderated comments in 1998 and being flooded with love; it continued in the early 200s with web 2.0, and particularly blogs. Blogs became very important in helping me to find knowledge I could then absorb and redeploy in my own projects. I wanted to take part in the online conversation, and to give something of my own back to it. So, in 2005, I took up blogging too, and have not stopped since. I immediately discovered that - though reading blogs can be fun and very instructive - it is only when you are a full participant in the web of online exchanges tat you can make the most of it. If you publish good stuff people will notice: they will leave you comments, be inspired by you to write their own content, and recommend you to their friends. This was a complete game changer for someone like me, who was not embedded into a top university: as if by magic, suddenly I was coming across knowledge that was 100% relevant to me - I would even say necessary - without any effort. Most of it was so knew that it would not hit the journals for years yet. My learning speed doubled, as almost all time previously spent looking for sources suddenly became available for reading.\n\nThis is possible because what is arcane and hard to find for you is an everyday matter for another person, and viceversa. If that person knows you exist and knows about your interests, she can send you very relevant knowledge with a click; and that click saves you hours, if not days, of sifting through libraries. And here is the trick: the more knowledge you share, the better people in your network will get at sending you stuff which is relevant for you; and the more there will be of them in your network, because people with similar interests tend to gravitate towards each other in social networks (a phenomenon called homophily). So you share: you would share it even if your motivations were perfectly egoistic. But in so doing you help others, because your thinking, obvious for you, can be very inspiring for someone else. I put a ridiculous amount of work in <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net\">my blog</a>: I have written more than 700 posts, most of them in two languages. I do it for free, and pay for the hosting and the occasional help with development out of my own pocket. It is a great investment, and I have no intention of giving it up: in fact you could say I owe my present job to the fact that someone at the Council of Europe reads my blog.\n\nOnce you learn the trick, sharing becomes quite natural offline, too. Creating club nights to build a nice hangout place for the local community; lending willingly your personal property; making the extra bedroom in your apartment available to people travelling to town; working out of shared spaces. I even wrote a book, ad somehow persuaded the publisher to put out an advanced dratf version on the web, with a Creative Commons license that makes it legal to download it and reproduce it. I have done all this, and I plan to do more in the future - for example, I really want to live in a co-housing space. But the Internet is the place where it all started for me.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-21 17:07:40", "updated_at": "2017-09-09 04:20:01.678690", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 927, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1356, "user_id": 60, "topic_id": 1323, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello everyone, my name is Augusto Pirovano, I live in Milan, in Italy and I\u2019m new on Edgeryders (although I have heard so much from Alberto). I would like to intervene in this mission because this is precisely the field in which I measured in the last 5 years.\n\nWith 2 other friends we made a project called <a href=\"http://www.criticalcity.org\">CriticalCity Upload</a>: a game of urban transformation that uses a web platform and asks its players to perform creative missions. So far CCU is not very different from Edgeryders, the fact is that the missions are - instead of stories and reflections to write and share with others as it is on Edgeryders - creative actions that are generally performed in the public spaces of cities. The player picks the mission, shuts down the computer, gets out on the street, plays the mission, collects the necessary proof of his experience and then, after returning home, publishes the mission attaching photos and videos. As the player gets points, he levels up until he reaches level 7 and wins the Mechanical Box (a mysterious box that is delivered at his home).\n\nSome examples of missions:\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/obliqua_0.jpg\" style=\"width: 569px; height: 212px;\" title=\"\">\n\n\"Segnaletica obliqua\" is a mission that requires you to invent a new road sign, build it and install it in your city. The image shows the construction of the sign that says \"duty of greeting your neighbor while waiting for the bus\". The sign reads: \"each traveler is obliged to greet arriving or leaving, the other passengers waiting at the bus stop. Any abuse will NOT be punished.\"\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/soggiorno_0.jpg\" style=\"width: 574px; height: 214px;\" title=\"\">\n\n\"Pubblico soggiorno\" requires you to make a living room in a square. As you go towards the higher level missions (there are 10 levels in CCU) missions are increasingly demanding to leave the house, coordinate with your friends and other players, perform in the public spaces of the city and interact with strangers. The image tells the story of what happened in Bologna between the two towers, on a spring day in which CCU players created a public living room, moving from house seats, cushions, lampshades, rugs, hot tea and biscuits and giving the space to all the people passing by. Obviously when you organize something like this, the unexpected is often the best thing, as in this case in the late afternoon, a Czech cellist was passing by with his instruments and players asked him to stop and play for them. Result: a sonata for cello improvised between the two towers, before the sunset with hundreds of citizens crowded around to enjoy the unexpected party.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/orizzonti_0.jpg\" style=\"width: 563px; height: 423px;\" title=\"\">\n\n\u201cOrizzonti di Neon\u201d asks to paint a chair in vibrant color and install it in a public place that has a beautiful view.

We found on the internet a series of videos on Youtube of a Chinese guy that teaches you how to create one step by step ... and it works! The mission ended then with the first (and so far last) appearance of \u201cPinzimonio Band\u201d in Milan's central station where dozens of players have organized a concert of vegetables, which ended in a collective dip at the end when everybody ate his own musical instrument.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/carminio_0.jpg\" style=\"width: 566px; height: 422px;\" title=\"\">\n\nFinally, \"Sfumature carminio per un nodo\" asks to go to a \u201cNode\u201d - these are special places special in the game and there are about 50 throughout Italy and in some foreign cities - dressed in red. The performance shown was done by a guy who came specially from Venice with his Cosplayer costume to achieve the mission in the \"Node Paolo Sarpi - Milan 01\".\n\nIn these years I must admit that we have not made many reflections on the theory behind what we do. But there is something we understood that we would like to share with you:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>The presence of a common helps to build another one: in our case a free Internet, with free services (such as. YouTube) allows us to improve and act on another common that is dear to us: cities\u2019 public spaces. So perhaps there is a multiplicative factor when a new public good is made available to all (not only the direct effects on its users, but also on all those other services that can be build on top of that common). Similarly privatizing or eliminating public goods is likely to have multiplicative negative effects on our society.</li>\n\n<li>If you work on commons, the absence of the profit motivation can be an important factor in order to gain the trust of your community. This is one of the reason why CCU is a non-for-profit project.</li>\n\n<li>If you work on a common good and you build around it a community of people passionate about it, a large margin of freedom generally doesn\u2019t generate anarchy, but positive effects. With CriticalCity Upload, for example, after a year and a half of activity, 13,000 missions carried out by more than 8,000 different players from all over Italy, not even one act of vandalism has happened and the community is very careful and protective about what other players do in their city.</li>\n\n<li>We can do many more things than we generally think. This means for example that you can achieve - albeit with great effort - a project as ambitious as CCU in 2012 in Italy. And, in the same way, a lot of missions that have a positive impact but that would be technically illegal (for example, \"pubblico soggiorno\" which asks for an afternoon to make a living room in a square of your city) can be done without receiving fines or be evicted, maybe with some common sense and some extra smiles!</li>\n\n</ol>What do you think?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-29 13:42:56", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 05:36:49.439106", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1119, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 627.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22187, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 5632, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>do it yourself</b>\n\neverything it's there to be merged on your side\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-03 15:14:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:03.626844", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20750], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1178, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1145, "post_number": 1, "raw": "It is no coincidence that Lote3 <a href=\"/blog/lote3-save-the-date\">happens in Matera</a>, the cradle of the first unMonastery ever and is dated close to the launch.

It is precisely that people now standing on brink of doing interesting stuff can cross the threshold if better equipped and supported by the community. How can we help you?\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tit is easier to pitch clients because of our expert feedback and information about how to pursue leads.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tif you need corporate vehicle we can give it to you, as there is now an Edgeryders functional organisation backing you up in applications for funding.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tIf you need to show action on your website or project page we can show it though the community social media team. Even as a one man or one woman show you can think of yourself as a semi-autonomous agent within an organisation.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h4>The Edgeryders Guide to Making Your Projects Happen.</h4>\n\nAll the above needs capacity building and upskilling so we can help each other and know where to reach out to community resources. We want people to use Edgeryders as a platform and pool of knowledge for making your own interesting, meaningful project happen. This can mean investing a few hours into becoming an effective twitter swarm, learning how to cross pollinate ideas from several platforms, being more effective in launching participation calls for your idea and scouting community talents to work with you. You can test such skills before the conference and onsite, and you can ask for help from community or through the company. In order to have all of these in one place we decided to aim for a concrete outcome of Lote3: building together a Guide to Making Projects Happen, a toolkit containing documentation of methodology, new kinds of knowledge and skillsets to be deployed in particular situations, as well as adequate organisational structures on how to access existing resources.\n\n<h4>How do I get involved?</h4>\n\nParticipating in LOTE is an opportunity for you to improve the skills you already have, pick up new skills you need in order to be better at getting your projects off the ground. You can also help others in scaling their projects\u2019 impact.\n\nWe know from past events that a lot of resources go into preparing an experience that is deemed meaningful by participants and into curating a program that has concrete outcomes, so better to get those in advance!\n\n1. Commit to come &amp; do it early. If we get funding, the people who pledge first are first in line to get funded travels. Registration for LOTE3 happens on the Edgeryders website by updating your <a href=\"/user\">user profile</a> with information about your attendance. If you are not already registered on the Edgeryders.eu platform, <a href=\"/user/register\">sign up here</a>.\n\n2. Make it yours. From conceptualisation to when we throw open the event doors, \u00a0LOTE is co-designed by you, members of the Edgeryders community. Do you have topic suggestions? Want to propose yourself or someone you want to invite as a speaker? Got skills to offer in organizing the event? Want to use the event to create your own job?

The readings are then transferred wirelessly, over the mobile-phone network to specialists in distant urban centers for interpretation, diagnosis and prescribed treatment.\n\nHere is the full story:\n\nBy making it possible to perform tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) in far-flung villages, the tablet is bringing high-quality cardiac care to remote and often poorly equipped countryside clinics where many Cameroonians go for their health care. It connects rural patients suffering from heart disease, many of whom do not have the means, the time, the contacts or the strength to travel to the big city, with Cameroon\u2019s few, primarily urban-based cardiologists.\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/wipo_magazine/images/2014_05_art_2_1.jpg\">\n\n<figcaption>The Cardiopad, developed by 26-year-old Cameroonian engineer, Arthur Zang, promises to bring high quality cardiac care to remote rural communities. It is built to withstand the humid climate and rough terrain of outlying villages. Equipped with a battery, it can run independently for around six hours at full power. (Photo: E. Harris/WIPO).</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe potentially life-saving Cardiopad \u2013 designed in Cameroon to address a Cameroonian problem, but which is also widespread across Africa \u2013 is the brainchild of 26-year-old engineer Arthur Zang. For now, the heart reading and interpretation are just a simulation \u2013 but that will change soon if Mr. Zang gets his way.\n\nThe winner of numerous overseas awards and grants, Mr. Zang hopes that his invention \u2013 imagine an iPad with home-build software built for deployment in the African bush \u2013 will revolutionize cardiac care in Cameroon. And for him, his business is also personal.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people in my family who suffer from cardiac illness,\u201d he says referring to the recent heart-related death of his uncle. \u201cSo personally, this has affected me but above all I would say it has impassioned me, because I know personally the daily existence of people living in the village \u2026 I lived myself in a village and I know how difficult it is to get specialist care.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr. Zang, Cameroon has only a few dozen cardiologists in a country of around 22 million people and these are clustered in urban centers like the capital, Yaounde, or the main seaport town of Douala. Roughly half of Cameroon\u2019s population lives in rural areas, according to the World Bank, while many others live in urban areas that do not have access to heart specialists.\n\n<h2>Life-saving potential</h2>\n\nThe young engineer saw a problem and set out to try to fix it. In 2009, while still a student, Mr. Zang began developing a software product that could help doctors monitor the health of their patients\u2019 hearts. He made contact with a Yaounde-based cardiologist, Professor Samuel Kingu\u00e9, who helped him better understand the type of technical solutions required. With these insights, the young engineer finally wrote a program that he loaded onto an off-the-shelf device. But he soon realized he needed the flexibility of his own platform, and so turned to developing his own hardware \u2013 the Cardiopad. \u2013 the first medical tablet in Africa, says Mr. Zang.\n\nThe Cardiopad has a simple-to-use, touchscreen interface that is adapted to the needs of remote health workers who may lack familiarity with the latest computing devices and the know-how required to use them. In tests by the Cameroonian scientific community, the Cardiopad has proven 97.7 percent reliable. It is solidly built to withstand the humid climate and the shocks incurred while being carried over rutted, often unpaved dirt roads like the one leading to the clinic at Mbankomo. The device is also built to withstand the frequent power cuts experienced in Cameroon and across Africa. Equipped with a battery, it can run independently for around six hours at full power.\n\nWith some 30,000 euros funding from the Cameroonian government, Mr. Zang was able to create a prototype and eventually travel to China, where he found a factory that could produce a limited run of Cardiopads while he searched around for partners to help fund his venture. Obtaining investments has been difficult. Finding the right contact in overseas companies is a challenge and the pitch is no easier. The device is designed to help Africans in rural, impoverished communities; \u00a0something that not all companies see as a promising prospect, Mr. Zang says. That\u2019s why he intends to tap into a very modern financing model \u2013 crowd-funding on platforms such as Kickstarter, where users can donate funds to, or purchase shares in, fledgling firms.\n\nFor now, he is searching for more funding, hoping to build upon the CHF 50,000 grant he received as a Rolex Award Young Laureate 2014. While funding issues have been a constraint, the pilot tablets he has been able to produce are now being tested in hospitals in Cameroon.\n\nMr. Zang\u2019s aim is to produce and sell his device for around 2,200 euros which is significantly cheaper than other commercially available, less portable devices. The hope is that hospitals purchasing the low-cost Cardiopad will be able to lower the price of medical examinations and speed-up medical diagnoses.\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/wipo_magazine/images/2014_05_art_2_2.jpg\">\n\n<figcaption>(PHOTO: MIMORE MEDICAL)</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n<h2>Patenting the Cardiopad</h2>\n\nHe also turned to the intellectual property (IP) system to help advance his work. In December 2011, he applied for a patent via the Organisation Africaine de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Intellectuelle (OAPI) in Yaounde [<a href=\"http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2014/05/article_0002.html#oapi\">see box</a>]. OAPI later granted him a patent (No. 16213) on his technology, covering some aspects of both the software and the hardware.\n\nObtaining a patent was an important step for Mr. Zang. \u201cI did it to reassure myself,\u201d he said, \u201calso to protect the product, and to have a lot more credibility in the eyes of, for example, partners with whom I wanted to sign contracts in order to be able to produce and then sell the product.\u201d\n\nWhen funds permit, he also plans to register the Cardiopad, and his company, Himore Medical, which currently produces the tablet, as trademarks.\n\n\u201cThe intellectual property system can help us in Africa \u2013 it can add credibility to African products. And credibility has repercussions on the business plan because if you aren\u2019t credible, it\u2019s difficult to sell your product,\u201d says Mr. Zang.\n\n<h2>Driving new developments</h2>\n\nThe budding entrepreneur is already in collaboration with other young Cameroonian engineers to develop a range of additional medical devices and technologies for rural areas. He points to what he views as a disconnect in the innovation environment in Cameroon: in the medical space, in particular, many of the creators and inventors are young like him \u2013 roughly half of Cameroon\u2019s population is under the age of 18 \u2013 so they rarely suffer from the diseases that products like the Cardiopad are designed to address.\n\nFurther, with a rapidly urbanizing population, urban dwellers may all too easily overlook the specific needs of those living in remote rural areas. For Mr. Zang, innovation requires a flexible mindset, a deep understanding of an entire economic ecosystem and an ability to commercialize ideas.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t only have engineering ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to go further, into researching the problems confronting Africans and then pursue research into solutions, subsidize the creation of companies, create business incubators that can help nurture projects, researchers, engineers and really help them move from the laboratory to the factory.\u201d\n\n<h2>Pursuing a dream</h2>\n\nUltimately, Mr. Zang\u2019s dream is to continue working to \u201cimprove life conditions\u201d by branching out into other areas of medical technology, envisioning specially adapted devices for echography and radiology.\n\nIn the Mbankomo clinic, the lack of these higher-end materials is evident. Surrounded by a tidy plot of well-brushed soil dotted with shade trees, the one-story clinic is austere. Patient consulting rooms are cooled by open windows, but little advanced machinery is on display. Mr. Zang says doctors at the facility are overwhelmed by the health needs of patients, which range from the mundane to the mortal. Connecting these clinics to better-resourced hospitals elsewhere via the mobile phone system is establishing a lifeline.\n\nMr. Zang hopes ultimately to manufacture the Cardiopad in Cameroon, and to help the country develop as a manufacturing center for lower-cost devices specifically tailored to low-resource environments and markets, like those in West Africa.\n\n\u201cThis will help lower the cost of medical exams and the cost of good health across the regions, in the villages,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s the dream that is smoldering in me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-30 10:45:21", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 16:43:43.639790", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1557, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27911, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 959, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Thank you for joining this conversation, Karl.

We set up a Policy Hero Challenge in Brussels last December, and invited key people in the European Commission to try to answer this, together.

There is a structured set of needs. So those who have problems in attaining their basic needs they don\u2019t see other issues. Those who have basic needs met and are in the upper level of the hierarchy then comes collective action and collaboration; anything before that is individual.

For example<span>, ice cairo is creating a toktok fab lab and take it to different universities around egypt and show them what the capabilities of these machines are to encourage the makers movement, this takes a lot of time; meanwhile they\u2019re doing their other activities and they\u2019re both just as important and it\u2019s hard to identify what is more important</span>.

Money is a challenge in Egypt but yet again it\u2019s not, sometimes it\u2019s easy to get money and sometimes it\u2019s challenging.

I love what it says about Ubuntu philosophy; \"I am because we are, and since we are, therefore I am.\" Growing the sense of 'we' is so fundamental to every other generative and evolutionary human project - at least to my understanding so far. I think of it as our 'collective muscle' - our ability to think on behalf of the whole. And this muscle\u00a0has become so\u00a0emaciated by the experiences of modernity. Its not simply about 'being together' or connecting - virtually or physically. It has a markedly different quality. The Misak indigenous peoples of Columbia seem to take this to a whole other level. When we co-hosted a workshop with one of their elders\u00a0late last year, I was really drawn in by their descriptions of the collective consciousness and how this only came about and was sustained by active engagement in Minga (collective work). You'll get a sense of the clarity of their thinking here:\u00a0http://www.lifemosaic.net/eng/tol/life-plan/ though\u00a0I don't think they mention Minga in this video.\n\nI don't get so much time to read so am a bit ignorant of\u00a0Descartes thinking but\u00a0am very familiar with its consequences for humanity and guess I have read enough on that!\u00a0The problems of the modern mind... one of the things I most enjoyed learning in the last three years was that we have three brains - observable by a surgeon - discovered about 100 years ago - but forgotten because we are blind to facts that don't support dominant world views - in this case the myth of hierarchy (there can only be one brain)! But also perhaps the dictatorship of mind as our primary sensing capacity.\n\nI love this quote too;\u00a0\"Instead,\u00a0<em>being</em>\u00a0is an act or event that must happen in the space between the self and the world.\"\n\nWe hear a lot in our line of work - this guy has low self esteem - or this woman lacks self confidence. I now see from reading the article you sent that this is itself based on Cartesian thinking. And\u00a0I think it goes way beyond loss of self esteem etc\u00a0- I think\u00a0we've been observing the people arriving at our door with profound loss of all\u00a0sense of self.

Some, like <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"https://twitter.com/elfpavlik\">Elf Pavlik</a>, are modeling non-transaction based economies. Others, like Jacky Mallet are attempting to reverse engineer the banking system from a systems engineering perspective. Taken as a whole their efforts are building the future we will all be living in tomorrow. I would argue that if we really want to understand how to address youth unemployment we should be asking how to better support our young in their future-building exercise. Why? Because as we have seen from the research carried out in Edgeryders, occupation is not what the older generation thinks it is. Adventurous, innovative young (and not so young) people are inventing new ways to work \u2013 ways that are not necessarily within the job-in-corporate-hierarchy paradigm. This sounds like good news \u2013 until the vested interests, which they disrupt in their quest for a fairer and more just world, fight back. And they do fight back.\n\nA recent article about the newly deceased Aaron Swartz pointed out how America has grown less tolerant of its genius eccentrics who push the envelope on issues. In Sweden we have our own case with <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.svd.se/kultur/piratkrigets-forlorare_7897468.svd\">the persecution of Peter Sunde</a>, a free information activist and dissident, by prosecuting him for doing \u00a0essentially what Google does. The Pirate Bay project was and is deeply political: making information freely available out of a deeply embedded sense of social justice in the Internet age. And let\u2019s not even get into the Julian Assange issue, which is still the subject of a much heated national and international debate. The list of examples is long: the establishment pushes young people towards dreaming up new ways of working, thinking, living. But when they do find them, it strikes them down in anger and fear.\n\nWith highly progressive unemployment rates and little chances of the trend being reversible, full occupation remains a myth; yet grassroots initiatives such as the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/ongoing/details/2013/000001/en\">Unconditional Basic Income</a> do bring in prospects for increased security and better welfare conditions. As argued by its advocates, it would also make it easier to practice a freely chosen occupation. If given more space like that, young innovators could work their way to build up responses to more complex needs, such as the need for more resilient structures (food security, community networks), and ultimately the search for meaning in one\u2019s working life. Some other examples of the kinds of initiatives that people might do more of if they didn\u2019t have to hustle so hard are :\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.archibag.com/interview-with/victor-marx\">Refurbishing public spaces</a> and \u00a0<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://www.stockholmsfria.nu/artikel/79607\">building homes for the homeless</a> in Stockholm by upgrading existing disused spaces and making them cosier or more artistic under what seems to be a \u201cguerrilla architecture\u201d, with no legal permits to do so.</li>\n\n<li>Using excess capacity to build bottom up social infrastructures like <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://prinzessinnengarten.net/about/\">urban gardens in Berlin</a> or appropriating disused buildings to provide community services in Naples.</li>\n\n<li>Building intentional communities like the Edgeryders <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"/2013-year-of-the-unmonastery-latest-update/\">unMonastery</a>, or the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/freelab-laboratory-freedom\">Freelab in rural Poland</a> that serves other groups, especially the local community, by offering social and technical support and education (hemp growing and processing or building rocket stoves).</li>\n\n<li>Engaging directly with politicians and participate in legislative initiatives. The anti ACTA mobilization last year, although triggering the reversal of governments\u2019 plans and using some non-orthodox methods as well, managed to get people and the civil society into an organized process of dissent, engaging through formal channels even if solely to disrupt them. <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/welcome-group/mission_case/anti-acta-poland-seen-inside\">The Polish example</a> stands as exhibit a, but the pattern has spread rapidly .</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nMaybe some of the world's leaders will help to build support for our young. I don\u2019t know about you \u2013 I am not holding my breath. Given the deep structural and ideological rupture between how political institutions and how new generations envision change, it comes down to what you, me and everyone we know can do to help broaden the hard-won islands of change. With the Internet and new technologies increasing our ability to process and understand political information, being part of the change is often at click distance.\n\nSo the question we\u2019d like to leave you with is what examples of good people, places, projects or processes do you know of that are trying to affect positive change in their communities? We\u2019d love to hear about them so we can showcase them and spread awareness about the great work they are doing and see if we can rally more support around it. Especially if they are based somewhere around the Baltic Sea area, tell us!\n\n<strong>Where does this all go?</strong> In preparing an anthology on youth, the labour market and democracy we will be hosting a <strong>research workshop on the 15th of March in Stockholm</strong>. The workshop brings together labour market and democracy researchers, people in the academia and other European experts, alongside <strong>YOU</strong>. The workshop discussions will be heavily based on this online conversation. A limited number of selected contributors will be invited to the workshop, with their travel expenses covered by Global Challenge. After the workshop, we envision these contributions to be further developed into individual articles (2500 words), meant for publication with an ISBN number this year. Each article selected for publication in the book will be paid for.\n\n<strong>All the comments and reactions to this post will be valid submissions for a workshop invitation, provided they are published before February 11.</strong> The more relevant your point is and the more active you are in the conversation, the better.

I don\u2019t think it will be of much use, mainly because I don\u2019t think the CE/EC has the power to solve (as in imposing policies and regulations) our local social problems.

Chances to overcome precarity is more on our hands than in the government\u2019s hands, saving time and energy as well.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-16 13:45:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:10.551921", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 470, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4436, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4403, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**_Available in: [Romanian](#ro)_**\n\n------\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/009515fb22e772e5e3216a6f19e6b0256c54d046.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"461\">\n\n## _Romanian version_ <a name=\"ro\"></a>\n\n<i>Poza: Anul trecut mai mul\u021bi dintre noi am mers \u00een Tbilisi, la o \u00eent\u00e2lnire a proiectului Spot the Future care se \u00eent\u00e2mpla \u00een Georgia, Armenia \u0219i Egipt.

I'd want to write a mission about my experience, but in these days I haven't the time. I hope to write it the next week, but after reading your mission I want to anticipate something.\n\nFirst of all I have to do a clarification: inside these spaces there aren't only visual and performing art workers, but also students, inhabitants of the neighborhood and people who work with cinema, publishing, translation, radio, journalism, technicians, researchers, cultural managers etc ie the so-called \"knowledge workers\". \u00a0Someone defines himself as \u201cimmaterial worker\u201d.\n\n<em>why people here decided to take the theatres instead of taking the squares? </em>\n\nI think that all the occupied spaces are symbols. Let me explain better:\n\n- Nuovo Cinema Palazzo (Rome) occupied in April 2011 because it had to be transformed in a sort of casin\u00f2 (slot machine, night club) giving it in the hands of organized crime (? malavita) so the inhabitants occupied the cinema. After almost 1 year the judge declared legitimate the occupation against the owner company.\n\n- Teatro Valle (Rome) occupied in June 2011 because it risked to be closed for the suppression of ETI (public institution that dealt with the promotion and distribution of the Italian theater , also abroad).\n\n- Teatro Marinoni (Venice) occupied in September 2011 during the famous Festival of Cinema because it had been allocated 37 million euros to build the new Cinema Palace. it was only a speculation and the palace was never built, while in the same area fell ruined the beautiful Marinoni theater.\n\n- Teatro Coppola (Catania) occupied in December 2011, the first municipal theater in the city, turned into depository/stockroom, closed since II World War.\n\n- Ex Asilo Filangeri (Naples) occupied in March 2012. It isn\u2019t a theatre, but a renovated palace investing millions of euros to be the location of the Universal Forum of Cultures in 2013. Until the great event the palace would hosted and produced cultural events, but after the opening is no longer used except as a place of some administrative offices of the Forum\n\n- Teatro Garibaldi (Palermo) occupied 4 days ago, a renovated theater, inaugurated twice in the last year and inexplicably closed\n\nThese spaces are symbols of a catastrophic cultural politics and of rhetoric of the great events in a time when social policies make work and life extremely difficult not only for knowledge workers.\n\nAnd so is from these symbolic spaces the occupiers protest against\u00a0 cultural policies, in particular against the financing procedures, the carelessness of spaces and ask a welfare system that recognizes the value produced by knowledge workers.\n\nWith the help of lawyers and economists it is developing a proposal of welfare inspired by the French system and they are designing and testing new forms of legislation and administration of the spaces in which culture is understood as a commons.\n\n<em>do people have somehow the idea of commons and they decline this idea about theatres or they need to manage an occupation and they \"meet\" the idea of commons finding something useful in this?</em>\n\nThe idea of commons more generally is related to culture, not only to theatres. From interviews and from life in these spaces I understood that what they define culture as a common is the recognition of a broader participation of the citizens, of the workers in governance and management of cultural policies and more transparency in the allocation of funding. The experimental forms of legislation, administration and sharing of means of production mentioned above could be tools to begin this new era.\n\n<em>and why they don't feel related to the ones who did take the streets? </em>I don\u2019t know :) but I\u2019ll think about and I\u2019ll ask to some occupants\n\nProbably I haven\u2019t a clear idea yet, but I think that this a good moment to change.\n\nThe greatest difficulty is to endure this participation and this ferment, to test the new tools to make these experiences sustainable in the long run. Tonight we talked about this in the Coppola theater (yes, when I'm in Catania it has become my second home).\n\nI could still write a lot about how the spaces are crossed by very different people, about the proposal of welfare that is being developed and my doubts about it, about the impact on the territory. I have so much stuff about..\n\nbut I hope to make more clear the ideas\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-17 23:37:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.348893", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 832, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20136, "user_id": 1974, "topic_id": 4073, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Yay!</b>\n\nHmm, how did I overlooked this?

To the point that comments here made me dream at night about missed planes.\n\nI would certainly not waste my time to sit in a conference where someone would deliver a speech like this: \u201cThere is no We.\u201d That would amount for me to a speech about \u201cThe earth is flat.\u201d\n\nUntil now, there may not have been much 'We' conveyed by our institutions, because these are conducted by people who themselves focus on the separate self.\n\nLife has taught me that a person's identity is a \"socially induced hallucination\". I found out that there is no such thing as a person. I realized that we are a localized expression of a unified field. \"<em>Every</em><em> drop of sap contains the fullness of the whole tree</em>.\" (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi) \u00a0Which means that in reality, there is only a bundle of consciousness constantly in flux. We perceive a separate self (Me). But it is an illusion. The real nature of beings is that there is only a We.\n\nDeepak Chopra explains that the biggest challenge now is that most individuals of our society believe in the separate self. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at6d5yjFGeE\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at6d5yjFGeE</a>\n\nBringing our attention to oneness inspires the gathering with a power or synergy that gives access to a field of possibilities. I'm not saying that all problems will fly away. But by making an effort to focus thoughts on oneness, it opens up possibilities.\n\nAlberto Cottica suggested the other day that I think in a Paulo Coelho-like way. This is how Coelho describes separate self VS oneness:\n\n\"<em>The vast multitude of humans (i.e., the sheep) know only the physical aspect of their existence. When an individual realizes his or her oneness, he or she sheds identification with the material world thereby raising consciousness higher to a purer realm.</em>\"\n\nI like to think that this (raising consciousness to a higher level) can be applied to the economy and to governance. It gives me hope and faith in humanity. It self-motivates me to continue to raise awareness about open government principles.\n\nTo keep repeating that there are no allies, that there is no We, is to remain in a separate realm. If this concept is not internalized, I hardly see how to move to the next step, the next Edgeryders campaign, 'We the people'.\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-19 03:42:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.387366", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 449, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12794], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31960, "user_id": 2470, "topic_id": 6092, "post_number": 22, "raw": "<b>Invitation</b>\n\nWhat do I need to at CERNs:s hostel?

Life has been a bit of a struggle for him - he has pursued conventional success and it didn't suit his temperament and he complains about life being constant suffering (although sometimes it as if he seems to enjoy the suffering, otherwise why would he keep doing it?). He also drinks alcohol a lot - I have always asssumed this is because he finds life challenging, because he is so sensitive.\u00a0 Having said this, he is still creative and charming and loveable. But he is hard to be with sometimes.\n\nI think modern life makes it very hard for such people and you need to try to find ways to live on the edge, and places to escape.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-18 16:02:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:31.765744", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 189, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15413, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 5617, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Erik's session </b>\n\nHow about first trying it in a situation where people are quite static - conference / seminar / mini-talks like Alessandro's on arduino day?\n\nI don't know exactly what Erik has planned so far, but it could be an opportunity to try, don't you think ?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-12 14:42:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:26.716697", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 55, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10874, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5028, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Thanks Rossella..</b>\n\nI like it, a little tough thoguh.. hope she does get back on her feet in the end. <a href=\"/u/kiravde\">@KiraVde</a>?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-12-05 10:02:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:02.740353", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [7107], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10074, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4867, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Almost there..</b>\n\nI added details of our companies and something on intellectual property.\n\n@ireinga can you fill in the details of your bank account?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-23 15:06:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:58.150769", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11499, "user_id": 887, "topic_id": 1461, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>About Freedom</b>\n\nI think freedom is to write or share feelings or what you think at that moment.

The devastation and destruction done by earthquake are imprinted physically and mentally on every Nepalese life and society. The loss and sacrifice made by us cannot be filled but only can be healed. The aftershock till today brings chill on every individual who has gone through so traumatic months of shaking. The earthquake not only broke people patience, it literally paralyzed us for following months. We were definitely shaken but not broken. There was mixed responses from various diaspora of society. While some were being stereotypical limiting their responses to tea talks, gossips, sided opinions, baseless speculations and sharing fruitless expertise. On other people displayed great courage, empathy and unity in immediate hours helping each other. Simply there was no caste, creed, class, language, religion, geographic divisions but only humanity to save life.\n\nAfter arduous months of relief activities we are on next phase of rehabilitation and re-construction so we can return back to normal life. There are challenges and hurdles which will impede smooth functioning of such activities. We have remote area with high geographical terrains, fractured landscape, limited infrastructures and areas virtually out of connection from rest of world. The approach should be frugal and local knowledge based so we can optimized scarce and limited resources.\n\n<strong>Frugal Innovation Approach</strong>\n\nNepalese society is frugal in nature we have always done more with less that is creating significantly more business and social value while significantly reducing use of scarce resources. Frugal is not cheap or mean but a whole new mindsets. It is mindsets that is able to convert adversity into opportunity to create more value at less cost for more people. This is what we need in current situation do more with less and limited resources. Frugal helps to drive resilience, adaptability, simplicity, inclusivity, empathy and passion to grow and innovate things.\n\n<strong>Seek opportunity in adversity</strong>\n\nOur homes and heritage sites have fallen into ruins but let\u2019s see it as half full glass we have got chance to rebuild it with better strength. We can incorporate seismic safety into traditional construction techniques will reflect traditional aesthetics along with. We can lend massive information, education, and communication programs to educate people about the reconstruction effort. There must be active participation of community and local people to give survivors a sense of ownership of the houses and communities that were being reconstructed, but also provided them with a sense of purpose to ease their minds in the aftermath of the disaster. This might be turning point for us. Decentralization, reallocation of villages, women empowerment, speeding of development works can be done with active people participation. Basically it has changed our mentality in person.\n\n<strong>Do more with less </strong>\n\nWe have already limited resources but we have more responsibility to do. Let\u2019s take example of how our hospital performed during early days of weeks. They definitely had scarce and limited resources beyond odds their service were commendable.\u00a0 We have been provided with opportunity to uncover hidden talents and resources. Obviously volunteerism and leadership shown by youth has to be upgraded to next level. We should understands local knowledge and expertise for incorporating it into technology. The resources need and type of re-construction differs by locality and community. Therefore, post disaster recovery should be locally led, as locals know what the community needs and what can or has been locally resolved. \u00a0If we recognized those resources we can carry out sustainable rehabilitation and re-construction at low cost.\n\n<strong>Energy Optimization </strong>\n\nThe energy is backbone for nation building and without access to energy no development work can take place. While we choose energy generation technology it should really have simple mechanism of implementation. Stove/fuel, solar lantern distribution, setting up Diesel Genset, solar suitcase for health clinic electrification can be done. AEPC\u00a0initiated a quick relief program to provide basic electricity services/ technologies for lighting and mobile charging. Gham Power is\u00a0compiling all the incoming help requests for power in a live map. Rebuild Barpak initiative has supported funding of a 50 KVA Diesel Genset to ensure access to adequate, safe, and reliable electricity in Barpak. The generator has been connected to the distribution network and will be supplying electricity to temporary shelters, agro-processing mills, construction equipment and communication equipment and infrastructure. Ecoprise has delivered 500 solar lanterns to survivors from Kavre, Sindhupalchowk and Nuwakot. They also plan to reach 1000 families with solar lanterns from dlight and solar power water purifiers from SOLVATTEN\u00a0in Sindhupalchowk, Kavre, Nuwakot and Rasuwa districts.\n\n<strong>Coordinating assistance</strong>\n\nProper communication and coordination prior to the dispatch of technical and physical support will be necessary. The government needs to be strategic in requesting assistance from various interested governments and organizations so that relief can be initiated in the multiple areas where we have suffered losses. In doing so, they will need to be in constant communication with local actors and also understand the assistance providers\u2019 comparative advantage and strategically link the two. Coordination will continue to remain key. The re-construction and rehabilitation supports should aggregate with long term development goals. Several cases of unmanaged relief are heard in media that people in Gorkha are not planting paddies this year as they have enough food stock. We should make them independent and self-sustaining not just give fish but teach them how to fish.\n\nThis approach will help to build new Nepal. We can rise above rubble and bounce back. This tragedy will help us to be united and move nation forward towards development.\n\n<!--[if gte mso

Getting the first stories up?\n\nIf you recall we discussed this during the <a href=\"/t/community-call-minutes-and-actionables-3rd-july/3233\">community call on July 3.</a> We agreed that the first step is for us to go out and ask project owners some open questions to help them arrive at a clear, easy to understand presentation of their initiative. As well as identify a clear challenge they have. The outcome of this first phase would be a collection of engaging stories with clear calls to action. The next phase: we then reach out to our networks (networks of hackerspaces, organisers of ccc) and the Internet at large to get inout around the calls to action and hopefully a couple of people who want to help out.\n\nWe decided that a sustainable way to do this is in a chain: have the first set of people with projects interview their peers and posts the results here. And then the person interviewed would ask one other person and post their story. And so on.\n\n<span>In order for this to get going we need someone to take the first step. That is compose a few blogposts with the results of this process, and we add the calls to action at the bottom of each of those post. That way people know what is expected (produce something like what they just read). It's a bit of work but the good news is we wouldn't be starting from scratch. We already have a number of interviews with community members as well as summaries that <a href=\"/u/samm\">@SamM</a>\u00a0has written and he's volunteered to help with the Documentation and Storytelling for \\#lote4. Project owners stories, the people and their initiaitves, are a big part of that. So maybe they could help?

We need to:\n\n1. <strong>Construct an initial questionnaire so each of us can go out and interview groups, online and off.</strong><em>\u00a0Does\u00a0what I posted above work?</em>\n\n2. <strong>Set up and run a hangout for people to drop in and talk about their projects</strong>. For it to pick up it needs to happen every week at the same time, same url. <em>Who can drive this?

Its ambience is mostly defined by the Sassi, the old city of dwellings that are half excavated and half built overground and are believed to have been continuously inhabited for 9,000 years \u2013 longer than any known human settlement. The unMonastery is located in the Sassi (<a href=\"https://maps.google.it/maps/ms?msid=207595146999890559764.0004d893ac371ab3461cd&amp;msa=0\">here</a> is a map with its location and those of other interesting and problematic places in town, built during a workshop with Materans themselves).\n\nThe Sassi were very densely populated up to the 1950s, when the Italian public opinion decided that the living conditions therein (hygiene was especially bad, with infant mortality four times as high as the national average)\u00a0were unacceptable for a country that wanted to be modern. Special laws mandated\u00a0the evacuation of the Sassi and the relocation of their inhabitants into new\u00a0neighborhoods designed by the best Italian urban planners of the time. As a consequence, the ownership regime in the area is quite intricate, with a lot of the real estate (including the unMonastery building) belonging to the state. Since the 1980s enterprising Materans have started to re-colonize the Sassi.\n\nMatera has a very cohesive society. You can expect to bump into people you know or who know you through others practically from day one. People you have met before will generally expect you to stop and chat for a couple of minutes. Be aware that <strong>most people are not comfortable speaking English</strong>: teaching yourself a few words of Italian is going to be a very good investment for your time in the city. People are generally very friendly and uninhibited in walking up to you and asking you questions.\n\nThe climate is quite mild by European standards. Temperatures below zero are rare even in the winter (<a href=\"http://www.ilmeteo.it/portale/medie-climatiche/Matera\">seasonal average temperatures</a>), and rainfall is moderate. Winter is short, and autumn long and mild: October, November and early December are normally pleasant. Food is normally very good, easy to come by and cheap. This is, after all, Italy.\n\nDespite the friendliness of the locals and the beauty of the Sassi, <strong>Matera is no utopia</strong>. Like most of Italy\u2019s Mezzogiorno, it is plagued by high long-term unemployment (the region\u2019s unemployment rate in 2013 is 15.6%, well above the national average of 11.4 and double the average of Northern Italy); an aging population (average age 41.7 in 2011, with 18.4% over 65 years of age); and a growing sense of despair and disempowerment as the Italian crisis unfolds.\n\n<strong>This sense of impending doom might be the unMonastery\u2019s greatest challenge</strong>. It reverberates into a generally conservative attitude, as a well as a deep mistrust of institutions (while Basilicata has fared better than other regions, the effectiveness and transparency of governance in Southern Italy is generally considered to be abysmal). In 2011, when the city decided to run for European City of Culture 2019, the decision was greeted with enthusiasm by some, but with skepticism by others: many Materans think their city is too backwards to deserve any recognition, and think the City Hall should focus on running business as usual. The unMonastery is a pilot project of the Matera 2019 committee, and some of the skepticism that surrounds any local government initiative in the area might have rubbed off on the unMonastery. Check out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTcywyib6w8\">this video</a> made by a local blogger (English. Thanks Francesco and Donato!) to get a feeling for this. We expect the first unMonasterians to make some effort to prove their usefulness to the local community before such reservations are lifted.\n\nAs an unMonasterian, you are encouraged to make your own inquiries about Matera, Basilicata and Southern Italy in general. A better mutual understanding across Europeans from different corners of the continent would not be a bad outcome from this project.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-05-23 09:24:28", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 05:28:28.597639", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 769, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 230.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4195, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4162, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1061c02ef026ffdeae6019515ada9037167f8817.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"><br>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1061c02ef026ffdeae6019515ada9037167f8817.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"><br>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1061c02ef026ffdeae6019515ada9037167f8817.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nAs an incredibly diverse community, the range of experience and knowledge about building economically sustainability projects amongst members ranges from \"where do I even begin\" to \"I just sold my 3rd company\". Also, there are many different interpretations of \"economic sustainability\" and strategies for achieving it. <a href=\"/en/makerfox\">Moneyless crowdfunding with Makerfox</a> anyone?\n\nA recurring topic is one David De Ugarte dove into in this <a href=\"http://goo.gl/02LvFP\">Las Indias's piece</a> on generating revenue through sales. Especially in purpose/value driven contexts, this topic is often controversial and deeply unsettling: []\u00a0<em>our \u201cconscience\u201d and the \u201cprivate logic\u201d will join forces to tell us \u201cwe are not good at it\u201d, and that this \u201cit\u201d \u2013 selling \u2013 is very close to deceiving. But this is false.</em>\u00a0\n\nMost initiatives fail to generate monetary resources not because they don\u2019t manage to develop and deliver a product to the market; they fail because they develop and deliver an experience, service or product that no customers want or need enough to pay for. This is not magic though, it is something that you learn to do.\u00a0\n\nMany of the projects we see popping up on Edgeryders, are collaborative and decentralised initiatives. Perhaps it makes sense to structure a process which everyone can participate in to build economic sustainability into projects in a decentralised way:\n\n<ol id=\"docs-internal-guid-994ab19c-a17f-efdd-043e-a385745d2045\" style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\n\n<li>\t<h3 style=\"line-height:1.656;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span>Identify and document our assumptions</span></h3>\n\n<ol style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\n\n<li>\t\t<span>What are our assumptions/hypotheses about how we gratify our clients and or sponsors, who they are, how we will acquire and monetize them?</span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>What are our assumptions/hypotheses about how we serve the needs of our constituency, who they are, as well as how we engage them into becoming more active participants in (and beneficiaries of) our initiatives?</span>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<h3 style=\"line-height:1.656;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span>Talk to prospective customers to validate (or invalidate) our assumptions</span></h3>\n\n<ol style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\n\n<li>\t\t<span>What problems do they face? \u00a0How do they solve them? \u00a0What matters to them? \u00a0What is a must-have for them?</span>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<h3 style=\"line-height:1.656;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span>Identify the risk factors in the opportunity</span></h3>\n\n<ol style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Are we facing significant technology risks? \u00a0Or more of market risk? \u00a0How can we test and validate these (starting with the most risky)? \u00a0What market testable milestones can we build that would result in sufficient evidence to induce us to pivot or move forward?

If they decide to move forward, we'll meet in the week 22-25 April (also involving Michal and hopefully Felipe. Do you think it is clear enough? Want to make changes?\u00a0\n\n<h1>CITIZENHACK EUROPE</h1>\n\nA weekend that brings together hackers and civic activists from across the continent to create tools for a better European democracy.\n\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n\nThe 2014 European Parliament elections will be significant for several reasons. They will be the first where the Europarties present candidates for Commission President, giving each campaign a clear leader. They will be the first since the full impact of the eurozone crisis, and pan-European issues around austerity, growth, and jobs will be to the forefront.\n\nHowever, the European political space is immature and debate still mostly happens at national level. Building a European political space, and by extension a European demos is essential if the institutions of the Euro currency and the Union are to be truly democratic and accountable.\n\nEurope's size and scope, and the fact that its institutions are still forming, mean is has the potential - perhaps more than established national institutions -\u00a0to attempt new forms of networked governance and politics.\n\n<h2>What we want to do</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Stage a hackday</strong> to create tools for building an European political space. The key concept is the hidden interdependencies between European political spheres: what happens in Greece affects the life of people in Poland, and so on. The goal is to increase the public's awareness of such interdependencies, and the degree of control over them.</li>\n\n<li><strong>In advance, set participants a broad\u00a0challenge</strong> around the need to create a citizen-led\u00a0European politics in place of\u00a027 national policies on Europe, and collaboratively identify projects and areas for work.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Gather up to 150 hackers and civic activists</strong>, with every European country represented, for three days of intensive creation. Provide space for hacking in a broad sense, with tracks for legal, data, communications hacking in the interest of inclusivity (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/X7ab2x\">more on this</a>).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Produce a set of first-draft tools</strong> for building a European political space, and introduce them to the institutions and politicians.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Use and grow the network</strong> that we create as the seed for a broader European community of civic and technology activists.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Proposed dates and venue</h2>\n\nNovember 2013, Brussels \u2013 ideally within the European Parliament building. The event latches on a CitizenHack Europe London already on track, supported by the European Commission Office in the UK. Other CHE events can be spawned based on local capacity, with London a possible venue for an\u00a0initial challenge-setting discussion. Venues need to have high-speed wifi for multiple connexions, and be easy to access.\n\n<h2>The team</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The Democratic Society. Democratic reform and civic activism organization undertaking work with UK national and local government on democratic reform and openness. Organisers of CityCamp Brighton and the CityCamp Brighton network, a successful unconference and hackday weekend that has run in Brighton with more than 200 participants for the past three years.</li>\n\n<li>Edgeryders. Social enterprise, spun off from a Council of Europe-European Commission project, with a strong community spanning the whole continent. Committed to empowering individuals \"from the edge\" to take direct action towards systemic change for good. Organizers of the Living On The Edge conferences.</li>\n\n<li>[add others as they come in?]</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2013-04-08 16:39:05", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:01.909104", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 678, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 35.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 444, "user_id": 2199, "topic_id": 411, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Local food for communities\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-10 18:10:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:00.689031", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 498, "user_id": 3143, "topic_id": 465, "post_number": 1, "raw": "test\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-19 10:16:26", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 07:34:48.990538", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24435, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 2659, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Hello Enli!:)</b>\n\nWelcome on board!\n\nI am very happy to share this space with you!

It engaged over a 130 participants in Georgia, Armenia and Egypt in a massive, peer to peer conversation online (on the Edgeryders platform) and offline (in various workshops and a \u00a0final conference, Futurespotters). It succeeded in bringing together people doing groundbreaking work at the edges, who did not know one another before the project, and who had little previous interaction with organisations like the UN in a real conversation: many have remained in contact, and we have seen several collaborations spring up between participants after the project ended.\n\n<strong style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">It turns out Spot the Future has already made an impact - If you participated in the project last year you have contributed to a major strategic change happening at the United Nations. To prepare for the next step, we are hiring engagement managers in Armenia, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Marocco and Ukraine for a new project.</strong>\n\nThe new project is about youth volunteering. It is run jointly by UNDP and UNV, the United Nations Development and Volunteering arms respectively. It works like this: mature political \u00e9lites tend to see youth as younger versions of themselves. Their values and practices are assessed as a function of their proximity of those embraced by their elders. This is understandable on a human level, but it is also a cognitive bias: young people are not defective older people, and what we do best may be something completely different from what our elders excel at. \u00a0As a result of this bias, change tends to come from directions that mature political \u00e9lites are not looking in, and to take them by surprise.\n\nAn obvious example is politics: while established players complain that youth seem uninterested in politics and civic engagement, young people are busy inventing new, exciting political movements at the same time as we are turning our backs on traditional party politics. The world of volunteering, too, is undergoing profound transformations; one of the findings from Spot The Future is that many of us are donating our time to activities not normally thought of as volunteering: social startups, social enterprises, digital campaigns, market activism. Wherever we look we are seeing signs that social innovation (often in a form that de-emphasizes financial sustainability, or accepts very high risk of failure) is a new form of civic engagement.\n\nPartially as a consequence of meeting the Spot The Future crowd, UNDP and UNV have taken all that onboard, and are out to look at volunteer-driven initiatives in a new way. They are looking for new partners: individuals and groups, often as the edge of society, trying daring, radical new strategies to thrive in a changing world. If you are reading this, chances are they are looking for you, and your friends and partners. This means you have the chance to get involved in designing a new United Nations program for the future of youth volunteering in employment, social protection and data. This covers a lot of ground, people: from leadership programmes through soup kitchens all the way to civic hacking.

So I've let my thoughts mature for a day or so, and now let's see if we can make any progress in our little discussion, esp. in defining what the problem is (if there is one, of course).\n\nThere's really no reason to rethink the complete approach of the Edgeryders project. Using software support to find generalizations within a collection of stories is actually a good idea. Allowing that to others is a good idea, too - in the sense of supporting open science, and ya know, I'm fan of all things open ...\n\nSo the only issue is, how can the Edgeryders data be shared without any harm for the privacy of the users, even in the long run of say, 20+ years (who knows, actually) that such a data package might be used in research.\n\nAlberto, you already mentioned that you are going to anonymize user names and handles. So you're aware that there's a need to protect privacy in a data dump. Now the issue is, identifiability is not just in the user name field of a post on this site, but also in: mentioning the name of a fellow Edgeryder in some comment (see how I started this paragraph?), mentioning organization names and workplaces and living locations, mentioning links to websites of own projects, and probably more.\n\nAll this happens naturally in social discourse, and for proper anonymization, all this has to be edited out. Because, with some Google queries, everybody can connect these little names and facts back to the real-world identities of people - in many cases at least. When I am not mistaken, the actual names of projects, people, locations etc. are not at all relevant for the task of making sense of a collection of stories. Because on this aggregate level, one will look at how often similar positions and events are told, and what stories have in common. At this level, it's not about inividual great ideas and projects to select from any more (that's what happens in social discourse), but about getting the big picture from many small stories. So I guess redacting out all the info that makes us re-identifiable would not hurt for analysis. It's of course some effort ... but so is reading the whole stories and doing the ethno-annotations.\n\nNow why is redacting out all this so essential, in my view? (I'm sorry Lyne ;) but I need to get technical again ... it just <em>is</em> a technical matter that I'm trying to explain.) Edgeryder users agreed to licence their contributions CC-BY. From potential experience with open content, we are aware that this includes licencing for human usage, for serving as a basis for adaptation, translation, being incorporated in other texts, turning up in Google and so on. And I have no issue with all these modes of human processing - it's not more dangerous to me than putting all this Edgeryders content as CC-BY on my own website, which I clearly would do. To do any major harmful analysis of this content (like creating a personality profile of me), people would have to read through all this for hours and hours, understand it, annotate it, run statistics on it etc.. That's too much work even in the case of investigative journalism: these folks look for the few condemning pieces, which are not in this content.\n\nBut when we transform content to data, in this case by ethno-annotations, network analysis and offering as well-structured, downloadable archive - then we enter a different world: away from slow human processing, here comes computation. Doing harm is not prohibitively expensive any more once the semantic annotations have been done. That's also why the laws are about \"data privacy\", not \"content privacy\": the real dangers come with the novel options of automated data connection, computation, deduction etc.. (And on a side note, \"open data\" regularly is about anonymous aggregate data, or to non-personal data - isn't it?)\n\nSpecifically, I'm still not easy about the content of these ethno annotations: Alberto's examples are clearly benign, but might annotations also include things like \"case of bad success\", \"economic dead end road\", \"low income\", \"poor\", \"social difficulty\"? ... I simply don't know because it's not stated so far. Even if it is, given the opportunity for other researchers to add to this content in crowd-sourcing manner, nobody knows what they will add. And then somebody adds an algorithm to create automated (and public!) personality profiles from this data (the nightmare of data protection), and somebody else follows some links and annotates the data with background on our projects and with our real names ...\n\nThat's why I argue now for radical anonymization, resulting in a set of stories that cannot be traced back to real persons. Such procedure would also be in unison with the principles behind data privacy laws (using the German example now). One is the principle of data economy: do not collect more data than necessary. Collecting data about people, project, location etc. names is not needed for story evaluation - so omit it. The leap to take because of the novel content-to-data conversion principle behind Edgeryders is this: omit these names in the content, because else it might end up as data in some research projects lateron. That's not in the laws, but should be a logical conclusion in an environment like Edgeryders where content-to-data conversion is done. Or put another way round: the ethno-annotations are structured data, so it would be required per privacy laws from the Edgeryders project to state upfront what data will be collected about users and what uses will be made from the data.\n\nPrivacy laws (at least German ones, as an example) also state that it's not ok to create novel uses from the data collected, or to correlate them in uses that were not stated upfront. For example, when using Google Analytics on a webshop, I'm not allowed to correlate this data by IP address or time stamping with customer identities, because I stated in my webshop's privacy policy that \"web statistics are collected anonymously\". Applying this to Edgeryders, you would have to disallow that ethno-annotation data on anonymized stories is correlated with identities again. If Edgeryders would do all this research in-house, I'd clearly trust you to abide by this policy (you are trustable people, actually!) ... but now that it's intended to hand out the whole package for any kind of applications by third parties, I don't have that trust level. (That would amount to dumping pseudonymized customer data plus the full Apache web server access log into the open, enabling people to technically make correlations that are forbidden as per teh webshop's privacy policy.)\n\n<strong>@Alberto:</strong> so what do I propose in practical terms:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Go on with the Edgeryders project and evaluation as intended - it's a great idea after all! But make really sure that no traces of personally identifiable content is left that could later turn up converted to structured data. That means eliminating in the data dump package all references to names, organizations, own websites etc., see above.</li>\n\n<li>This redaction can be done by the team, or we could help you folks by redacting our own content. But for that, you'd have to make comments editable, also when they have replies. I proposed to use a separate \"content freeze\" period at the end of the project for this, as the content would be morphed to something that is pretty useless for socializing on this site any longer, while still being useful for ethnographic evaluation.</li>\n\n<li>Proper anonymization also includes to remove the unredacted content from this original Edgeryders site once the data dump is placed online. Because else, data correlation for de-anonymization could be made automatically.</li>\n\n<li>Create a data privacy policy on the Legals page about the data that will be collected from us via the ethno-annotations, network analysis and other means. CC-BY content licencing is one thing, and we already agreed to it, but we will have to also agree to the collection of structures data.</li>\n\n</ol><strong>@Lyne:</strong> Have to add a special part for you! Many thanks for pointing out the importance of bravery in these times of change. And I'm with you here, and already have ideas and projects that I'll fight for. Yet a fight it is, and in a fight you don't leave cover for no reason, and you take some care. While CoE has an admirably positive attitude towards us, there will be others with adverse interests and ideas, now and in the future, and they will have likewise access to the Edgeryders data ...\n\n\u00a0 We're just learning, as a global society, to deal with the Web and all the openness it enables. Over here in Germany, we regularly have cases that illustrate how far away we are from having learnt that: cases where some careless but essentially harmless comment is successfully used against a person in office or responsibility. Take the example of Horst K\u00f6hler, a former German Federal President. Or just these days, some careless comments of Pirate Party Germany members that included Nazi Germany comparisons, used in their usual Twitter-esque manner, but exploited by the press ... . I am not ok with such petty-minded instrumentation of words for lobbying against persons - folks, get used to what happens in the speedy interactons of the web and that it's essential there to forgive and to really forget. But this quarrelling persists, and \"they\" dig it all out ...\n\n\u00a0 So because I expect this to still persist in 10-20 years where my personal reputation might be key to some influential larger open society project or whatever, I take a bit care now to not leave a trace of ammo for my future hunters. I will fight then, of course, but \"the fight is won before it starts by the logistics people\" as we used to say ...\n\n<span><span>There must</span> be spaces, <span>like</span> <span>Edgeryders</span>, <span>to give </span><span>these people</span> <span>the freedom to be</span> <span>who they are</span><span>.\u00a0</span></span> <span><span>Because otherwise,</span> <span>the future</span> <span>of society</span> <span>is compromised</span><span>.</span></span>\n\nTotally right.\n\n<span><span>This means</span> <span>taking risks in life</span><span>,</span> <span>such as participating in</span> <span>an experimental project</span> <span>as</span> <span>Edgeryders</span><span> ---</span> by leaving a trail of data --- <span>and</span> <span>collectively push together the boundaries</span><span> a little bit further. </span></span>\n\nAlways open for experimentation over here, and the risk that is necessarily in it. Yet also add some reasonable care (not fear!) to the mix, and it gets even better. That's why I joined Edgeryders, and contribute to an emerging project, but also point out emerging problems. And those problems can be handled, see above. It's essentially just the application of existing data privacy laws to the unchartered area of data extraction from content ...\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-05 00:17:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.862101", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2003, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4139, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4106, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em><span><span>All images in this post (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) by <a href=\"http://christianedesir.tumblr.com/\">Christiane D\u00e9sir &amp; Fabian Neuville </a></span></span></em>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/882f9ad36695603ec91bcba99b4e0feabf8a0396.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\nHi Matthias and all,\n\non Friday night I went to a local <a href=\"http://timebank.cc/join-us/\">timebank.cc</a> meeting in Brussels with <a href=\"/u/guaka\">@guaka</a>. It was an interesting experience and it gave me a few ideas about how we can make Edgeryders and <a href=\"/makerfox\">Makerfox</a> even better :)\n\n<strong>Organising physical meetups is crucial for people to get to know and understand how to help one another in a community</strong>\n\nI went to the event because I made a decision recently to embed myself into the city where I currently live, Brussels. It's a place where there are a lot of expatriates and if you are not careful you can very easily spend 10 years here without making Belgian friends or really getting to know the place. Also I want to learn Flemish and improve my French. So when a Belgian acquaintance told me he was going to this thing and shared the link to the FB event, I wrote an email to the organisers and invited myself along :) <a href=\"/u/guaka\">@guaka</a> joined me too.\n\nWhen we got to the venue, a nice bar, the organizers gave each one of us a flyer. They also gave us a folded A4 with space to fill in your name, email address, what you need and what you offer... as well as some questions and topics to help get a conversation started.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/29cfd134f9e454f271f5200fb550a561aeaa8eee.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9c075acd0ed95c555cebd96a371105b8c24379c3.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\nFirst they described the political history of time banks and their personal motivations for doing this. They also described how time banks work in general. There was a discussion about the potential legal issues: some participants seemed to know about the topic. With others I got the impression they just saw a flyer and dropped in our of curiosity. A friend who runs an art gallery in a rougher part of New York always prints A4 flyers for his gallery events and puts them up on lamp posts etc in the neighbourhood to encourage a diverse mix of people to show up. It really works and is part of the reason I think his events are cool - you never know who will show up.\n\nThe event organizers also showed they eat their own dog food- they used the time bank to share the work of organizing the meetup. For example: The photos in this post were shot by a member of the time bank, and the flyer was contributed by another one.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5a9a871ad915ed36ea955e8435a9518fd3918eb6.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\n... they then asked us to pick a person that we didn't know and help one another to fill in our needs and offers.\n\nI ended up next to a number of people I probably never would have otherwise met. They move in completely different physical, professional and social environments from my own. The part that hit home was how much everyone wanted to help others and how difficult it is to do so. Firstly, a lot of people have a hard time articulating what they can offer help with, because there are so many things that we don't think of as being valuable. Even though they are huge stumbling blocks for other people.\n\nAs an example, one person had written a list of things they needed help with which I couldn't understand. Like \"editor\" and \"informatics\". I thought he looked cool so I asked him what he means? It turns out he feels he is unable to write. As we talked on he described his passion for building things, especially vertical gardens. And that what he requires is a website... that's what the writing and informatics was about.\u00a0 Really what he needs is someone to act as a sounding board to help him clarify his ideas, and then articulate them in writing. Maybe also introduce him to wordpress. Which clearly I can help him out with.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/363f3b7d0354238bb385edca271f8a9f2fed43d9.jgp\" width=\"690\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nMany of these conversations took place, and we all seemed to really get into it. At some point the organizers asked us to get the form filled out, which we did. And then people who brought laptops helped entered the contents into the the site manually. So the onboarding was also social and easy...\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/37303df2f7c537606f1fb7a3050187ae6ff79cc9.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\"><br>\n\nThis social aspect is very important: meeting so many new people in an environment where you are encouraged to to know one another is great. No one really wanted to leave :)\n\nSo I think this is something we can build on for local events. I liked the simplicity, but I think there needs to be a bit of inspiration...or people introducing what they are working on or would like to learn, and then others helping one another figure out what they need and what they can offer. The other thing I feel is missing is a learning path. Time banks assume everyone is already skilled at something or knows what they can offer. And they are focused on the one-on-one interaction. Edgeryders strength lies in the knowledge transfer and mass collaboration at scale/\n\nMaybe it would make sense to collaborate with the time bank crowd. The software they are using is not sophisticated enough to handle large numbers of exchange so I think this is something we could contribute of value.\n\nIn any case I really liked this crowd and will be using the time bank for myself and seeing how I can contribute to it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-15 12:39:39", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 08:16:56.376074", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1079, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 40.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7824, "user_id": 3185, "topic_id": 6064, "post_number": 2, "raw": "**Eccomi!**\n\nCiao a Tutti\n\nL'idea di una struttura residenziale con caratteristiche polifunzionali per il co-lavoro e la co-formazione \u00e8 assolutamente interessante, anche se nell'ambito della disabilit\u00e0 questo \u00e8 infatti stato sperimentato qualche anno fa (residenza integrata al territorio) purtroppo con esiti non propriamente lusinghieri.

Mi piace infatti immaginare che un progetto di alta innovazione sociale come questo, oltre ad incontrare il favore della pubblica amministrazione, possa in qualche modo stimolare l'interesse del mondo della ricerca (universit\u00e0 ed aziende), della finanza etica e dell'economia solidale oltre che coagulare diversi attori del terzo settore o, pi\u00f9 in generale, del no profit indirizzate a questo punto ad una azione di sinergia che possa contribuire \u201cdal basso\u201d al ridisegno di uno stato sociale oggetto di una profonda trasformazione.\n\nMi auguro che Bruxelles possa costituire un valido banco di prova come Milano possa divenire un secondo nodo di quello che potrebbe divenire un network all'interno del quale elaborare e trasferire nel concreto il pensiero, l'approccio ed il consolidamento di OpenCare.\n\nPersonalmente, insieme ad altre persone, sto riflettendo e lavorando a WeHandU, una iniziativa volta a supportare le persone nel processo di superamento della loro difficolt\u00e0 quotidiana attraverso la realizzazione di una soluzione ottimale per loro stesse e magari per qualcun altro (al momento si pensa al recupero della funzionalit\u00e0 della mano e del piede per i soggetti affetti da ictus, sla o lesioni traumatiche), in qualche modo cercando di creare un ambiente di progettazione, lavoro e condivisione della conoscenza che si traduce certamente in uno spazio di co-working e di living lab.

Al momento quanto esposto \u00e8 infatti oggetto di riflessione tra i membri di WeHandU, per quanto attiene le finalit\u00e0 e le possibilit\u00e0 realizzative dell'iniziativa a partire dalla localizzazione delle operativit\u00e0 previste (makerspace), ed argomento di informale conversazione telematica tra me, Alberto, Rune ed Alexander.

I'll bring what I have, but it will be great to have some extra things.", "created_at": "2013-07-29 13:09:00", "updated_at": "2018-03-03 09:11:21.827380", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 484, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 90.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [207, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28141, "user_id": 2334, "topic_id": 4055, "post_number": 9, "raw": "A thought for future action, when you arrive at any site that you will be using, whether it's a new flat, a field for a festival, a railway arch for a workshop, the first thing you should do is survey the site, and take photo's, so you have a record of the original state of the place when you arrived.\n\nThen log what changes you made, and the improvements you installed while you were using the space.\n\nAnd after the take-down-and-clear-up, record and photograph the state of the site afterwards.\n\nMake this part of the transparency that you apply to the running of the project, and you'll avoid this problem in future.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-20 11:35:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:35.164480", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 127, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [105], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17207, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5093, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Correct</b>\n\nThe common rooms are available with check-in on the 27th, check-out on the 30th.

(Actually these are just random ideas that come to my mind without knowing all the technical backgrounds, but maybe there's an inspiration for somebody else hidden in them.)\n\nFirst, I'd like to know what you use to guide the emergence design, if you think it's rather unfeasible to let it be informed by an \"optimum\" target condition? Just curious!\n\nThen, something on how I had meant the notion of \"perfect\". Of course there's no perfect state that could be calculated exactly beforehand, so I just referred to a favourable target state that could inform the emergence / interaction design. For that purpose, could we assume that the \"perfect\" set of connections would be the one that serves the platform's purposes most well, so, the one with the best synergy for figuring out transition in our case. Then further we could assume that these or similar enough connections would arise anyway, using the three existing platform mechanisms and <em>given enough time</em> and interaction options (including real life events etc.)\n\n(I agree to be disproven about assuming a \"target state\" if, in an online community like ours, there's no final state of connections which is quite constant over time. Yet so far, I assume from real life analogy that there are these (quite constant) better and less great positions in the social fabric for everybody, that is, where you're more or less productive / synergistic.)\n\nNow with this notion of a \"perfect\" state, one could measure what valuable connections arose late on the platform, and try to determine why this was so and how the platform could have enabled them earlier (all in a probability sense, like, what tools the platform could have offered that might have resulted in this connection happening earlier). This is the way how I'd judge \"quality of emergence\" on a platform like Edgeryders: emergence happens more efficiently if it happens faster, given the same amount of time investments.\n\nQuoting Alberto:\n\n\"there is a tradeoff between time invested surfing Edgeryders and the benefits we derive from it. We adjust our time investment based on competing possible uses for that time, and the benefits they give us.\"\n\nWhen Edgeryders offers mechanisms for more efficient emergence of connections, it has a \"competitive advantage\" compared to other uses of people's time. So people might surf it even more, positively reinforcing how well the platform and emergence on it works ... . Isn't it about such results why emergence design matters actually?\n\n\"I am not sure what you mean by a filter that covers the platform as a whole. What do you have in mind? Maybe it is my emergence bias, but i have trouble seeing Edgeryders as anything other than a structure emerging from a multitude of local interactions.\"\n\nYes, it's a structure that happens from local interactions. But how? As I understand it, emergence is designed by deciding what local interactions are possible and how easy they can be made. So interactions don't just happen - the platform capabilities and staff behavior influence what interactions will happen and when. So I had the idea of this \"filter\" as another major platform capability.\n\nFor that, I had in mind a sophisticated algorithm to let people discover interesting content and interesting people. Like an advanced version of the already quite nice but hidden <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/search\">advanced search</a> (took me some time to discover it!). Having such a tool positioned as the most prominent way to navigate would (IMHO) hopefully lead to more \"efficient\" emergence and thus to different sets of connections.\n\nOn a note, the filter might even use an algorithm similar to the sophisticated <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OkCupid\">OkCupid matching algorithm</a> - for non-romantic purposes here of course. ((And on another note just for the fun of it, OkCupid also has <a href=\"http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-biggest-lies-in-online-dating/\">hilarious nerdy data analysis</a> of their network, showing what can be answered with data crunching ...))\n\n", "created_at": "2012-08-08 16:03:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:15.196607", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 725, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9437], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27684, "user_id": 2560, "topic_id": 4453, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>one-day conference is better</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>, the proposal of one day conference is better i think.
