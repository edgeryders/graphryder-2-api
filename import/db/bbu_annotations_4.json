I will wink at you if I think you\u2019re a mirror. My inner voice has an annoying tone that i am much obsessed with. Ask me about it. I will enjoy my reply.So I'm a Libra and I read my horoscope every day as it tells me more about me. My horoscope mentioned, today, this very morning, that I would suffer a rejection. And I did!! What it failed to tell me was that I would do something so unhinged, that was so satisfying and moreish, that I've begun to rethink my future despite the shattering rejection. \u201cShe seemed so kind!\u201d they'll say.
