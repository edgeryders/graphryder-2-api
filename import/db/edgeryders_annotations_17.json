This screw up was a trauma on the citizenry at large because we are a small country - everyone knows/knew someone who had been there. There were Italian emergency personnel on the ground within 72hrs if memory doesn't fail me. @alberto can tell you about the Italian setup but in Stockholm we watched with incredulity as different ministers bounced around the responsibility for making decisions about how to respond. Sweden at the time did not have a central authority with responsibility for coordination of disaster management, or a clear chain of command for making those decisions.

Truth was unimportant and entirely subordinate to tactics and psychology.\u201d \nI don't know about you but to me this is freakishly familiar to strategy used today.", "created_at": "2020-10-20 14:38:00.389958", "updated_at": "2020-10-20 14:38:00.389958", "tag_id": 966, "post_id": 84659, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 14462}, {"id": 26319, "text": "", "quote": "I've said this before, even though I fundamentally agree with the idea of personal freedom AND responsibility, I'm not quite sure how low level 'common sense' measures could have been taken in states where the tools for crisis management are lacking, not to mention the severe lack of capacity of medical systems:\nI think there;s a reason why we are now seeing a second wave that incidentally coincides with the relaxation of some measures..

All of the members of our global collective want to see that happen. \n\u00a0\nThe FairCoop Thessaloniki is a local group linked to the global movement. We\u2019re all dealing in different ways with the establishment of tools and processes that would bring about alternative, cooperative economies. \n\u00a0\nIn the case of our city, to some extent, it\u2019s done by implementation of alternative cryptocurrency, faircoin, developed by the FairCoop. We try to understand ways in which this currency, and a local currency introduced after the crisis, can coexist and supplement each other. In any case, the goal is to free ourselves from proprietary technologies and capitalist banking systems - by creating a parallel circular model, ideally connecting and supporting a whole ecosystem of projects locally and globally. \n\u00a0\nThere is also the ambition to create a health care system within the communities by implementing the same solutions and building autonomous, community managed and driven scheme, highly independent from the existing one. For example, it could be done by using the percentage of community\u2019s income to fund health care. It could even in the future take shape of an autonomous security system. Considering the increasingly ubiquitous 3D technology, many of the medical tools can be soon printed cheaply by anyone. Small ethical pharmaceuticals will be able to produce their own medicine. And all the wealth that is sucked up from the communities will stay there, making them stronger and independent. It is already the case in Spain, where after 6 years of experiments in the communities of all kinds a lot of generated income has been fed back and used to build, support projects, create systems of all kinds. \n\u00a0\nWe also plan to replace the public system with a cooperative one. For now, it\u2019s a hurdle - but in the future, it will be possible. The condition? The strong community behind it. \n\u00a0\nFairCoop exists since 2 years, and in Thessaloniki, it started a few months ago. We have links with dozens of cooperatives, organizations, initiatives and communities - such as Bitcoin community, P2P foundation, Catalonia Cooperative, etc. We\u2019ve brought on board more than 1000 people so far. Yet, there\u2019s still a lot to be done. We need to connect and build stronger alliances even in the cities - in Thessaloniki, many existing initiatives remain disconnected from each other.

Yet, the relationship between the utility (U) consumers gain and the data (D) they supply \u2014 \u201creturn on data\u201d (ROD) \u2014 remains largely unexplored. Expressed as a ratio, ROD = U / D. While lawmakers strongly advocate protecting consumer privacy, they tend to overlook ROD. Are the benefits of the services enjoyed by consumers, such as social networking and predictive search, commensurate with the value of the data extracted from them? How can consumers compare competing data-for-services deals? Currently, the legal frameworks regulating these transactions, including privacy law, aim primarily to protect personal data. They treat data protection as a standalone issue, distinct from the benefits which consumers receive. This article suggests that privacy concerns should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of ROD. Just as companies can quantify return on investment (ROI) to optimize investment decisions, consumers should be able to assess ROD in order to better spend and invest personal data. Making data-for-services transactions more transparent will enable consumers to evaluate the merits of these deals, negotiate their terms and make more informed decisions.

The river is the most sacred Hindu and Buddhist river in Nepal and its banks border the holiest Hindu temples and several UNESCO heritage sites. Yet, it is the most polluted river in Nepal. The Bagmati River is also a prime example of how adversely climate change can affect a community while, at the same time, highlighting the resiliency and commitment of the residents to continue the fight to mend their river. The importance of the river to the people of Nepal and residents of Kathmandu had resulted in inspiring city-wide community events that have tried to restore the sacred waters. While their efforts are admirable and have motivated government action, little has been done to mitigate climate change causes or to adapt communities to their present conditions or to future projections. The proposed book, documentary and related programming connects the science of water quality and climate change to effects of urban migration, social norms, economics, industrial development, and government policies. The book will also investigate how the river\u2019s condition has affected religious rituals and culture. The inclusion of interviews and artwork by professional artists whose work deals with the Bagmati River will provide a unique visual perspective on Kathmandu\u2019s cultural connection to the river. While the issues investigated are specific to Nepal and the Kathmandu Valley, the general causes of the pollution, degradation of the water and its connection to climate change is reflective of many rivers and communities throughout the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through aesthetically-interesting and related imagery, maps, and graphs, we hope to provide a new perspective on the interconnectedness of science, economics, environmentalism, health issues and art as it relates to the complexities of clean accessible water and the related social issues.

I agree that stress and suffering are part of life @noemi @odin @Alberto, that stress to some degree even make us thrive, grow @steelweaver. But in the end stress should not become bigger than our coping skills, it should not be overwhelmingly disturbing.\u00a0\n\nIn general, I think of art and creativity as an expression of oneself, an expression of our inner world, our 'being' in the world, our being 'me'. Being authentic is by definition being different from others and thus coping with judgment,\u00a0 the others , the outer world goes along with it.\n\nBut I also think that feeling different, an outsider, more sensitive than others, etc etc .. is often a 'symptom' of trauma, a result of not having our needs met in the past f.ex, wich often results in losing our own connection with our needs, our connection with ourself.\u00a0 This disconnection is trauma, the residu of pain. In my vision many artists are trying to 'heal' themselves through their art - redefine themselves, trying to find a way to become 'whole' again - integrate pain and trauma. Artists are often 'self-healers', they are their own therapists.\n\nWhen the self-healing fails, they might consider exploring the pain and trauma trough different glasses - those of a therapist. Thinking out of the box could help them cope better \n\nThis is the more or less classic, freudian, psychological explanation for 'artistic pain'.\n\nThere is another explanation though, one that is defended by one of the founding fathers of expressive arts therapy S.K. Levine : that art is the expression of our soul, our 'acorn', that we are born with a 'mission', something we want to express, and that the struggle to discover and express this acorn, this individual mission causes pain. Levine thinks we overfocus on pain and trauma caused by environment/youth/parents... We should instead in therapy look more for 'the inborn authenticity, the inborn self'.\n\n(If interesetd in this latter explanation: See Stephen K. Levine: Trauma, Tragedy, Therapy: the Arts of human suffering (quite a philosophical, demanding book - but very interesting out of the box view for therapists )\n\nHope this helsp as a theoretical frame @Pauline", "created_at": "2017-11-28 21:04:40.318113", "updated_at": "2017-11-28 21:04:40.318113", "tag_id": 2122, "post_id": 31148, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 647}, {"id": 12904, "text": "", "quote": "Mary Ellen Copeland says about hope that \u2013 People who experience mental health difficulties can get well, stay well and go on to meet their life dreams and goals.\n\nI had a very happy childhood. I went to a rural all boys National School and was in a small class of 8 boys. My memories of that time are mostly of playing lots of sports and having the craic (Irish word for fun) with my fellow students. There was no bullying whatsoever, indeed bullying was something I didn\u2019t know existed until I went to secondary school. This period in my life was the classic definition of Childhood Innocence.\n\nFrom my first year in secondary school I was quite successful academically. Even though I was quite happy at school I found the weekends and holidays from school difficult. I would never see my classmates at the weekends or at Christmas, Easter or summer holidays. This was the start of the first time I ever felt feelings of depression. It was before the time of email, or mobile phones or social media. These times were times of complete and utter isolation from my friends. In these dismal days I used to study hard, write melancholic poetry and just postpone my happiness to when I would be finished my Leaving Cert (Irish exams) and be able to escape to a distant University. I did feel the presence of Hope. I felt I could suffer and suffer during those teenage years and that things would be better when I moved on to University. Where did my hope stem from? I was very academic and had dreams of becoming a mathematician or a poet or a political activist. I fantasised about being as prolific and brilliant as Yeats or Da Vinci.\n\nWhen I was awarded a place in Engineering in Trinity I moved to Dublin. I was unhappy with my Engineering course and after a few weeks stopped attending and instead just led a party life, drinking for the first time. I started to feel very isolated and depressed but I didn\u2019t tell my family or friends the true extent of my feelings.\n\nI recall writing very black poetry at this time and feeling a strong sense of failure.\u00a0 At that end of term I formally withdrew from the Engineering course and returned to home in Galway.\n\nWhile I was in Dublin I met Deirdre who was studying the same course as me. From the first meeting we hit it off and developed a very strong platonic relationship. Even though we both would end up being diagnosed with the same bipolar label Deirdre and I never discussed mental health issues. We would go to pubs and gigs together and discuss music, poetry, philosophy and other topics. When I moved back to Galway we corresponded by snail mail, sending each other long handwritten letters and photocopies of poems and inspiring song lyrics. While we didn\u2019t discuss depression or medication Deirdre and I both were able to express to each other how black our lives could feel. I guess you could say we held Hope for each other.\n\nThat Christmas my health deteriorated and I acquired glandular fever. After a short hospital stay I returned home to suffer months of crippling fatigue. I have battled with severe fatigue ever since.\u00a0 I was ill for most of that year and was idle until I won a place in Information Technology in the University in Galway. Even though I was living at home I was very happy to attend this course. I found this University more relaxed and got on very well with my classmates. For some reason I suffered a breakdown during my final term of my degree. I didn\u2019t tell friends or family but had meetings with some of the lecturers to see could I postpone my final exams.\n\nI found my mind was racing and I felt I needed very little sleep. I also used alcohol to help me relax and unwind from the racing thoughts. Since my father was Bipolar my parents recognised these symptoms and persuaded me to see a G.P. to deal with them. After a short meeting with my family G.P. he recognised the classic symptoms of mania and set up an appointment to see a psychiatrist. That psychiatrist whom I saw for 13 years admitted me to hospital.\n\nI suffer from Bipolar 1, meaning I suffer very high highs or mania, and very suicidal lows. When I get my highs medication seems to have very little effect on me. Instead it is a case of spending months in the safe confines of a hospital until the mania subsides. When I have my lows I get very suicidal and on two separate admissions for depression I have had to resort to Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) to treat my severe depression. There is quite a lot of controversy over ECT. I believe that it is a useful treatment of last resort. When a patient is in hospital and has been suicidal and catatonic with depression for many weeks with various medications being tried to no avail then I think ECT should be considered.\n\nIn the past 14 years since my first hospital admission I have had perhaps 4 or 5 admissions for mania and 2 or 3 for depression. Thankfully I have managed to avoid admission to hospital for the past 6 years except for six nights in summer last year.\n\nMany of us have lost loved ones to suicide. The loss is devastating. I lost my father and my friend Deirdre to suicide. My father had been diagnosed with Bipolar and suffered from the condition from middle-age. Looking back I can see the times he was manic or high, singing loudly on the half hour drive to school where he taught every day. I vividly remember during my teenage years his first admission to psychiatric hospital my Dad weeping with happiness when he was released home on leave for a few days at Christmas.\n\nDad snapped one day in school and that was the end of his teaching career. From that point on he had two overdose attempts. He had gone undiagnosed for the physical illness Haemochromatosis for many years and this aggravated his severe arthritis. My father was in severe pain. Unfortunately his Consultant gave him the news that his arthritis was so severe that he wouldn\u2019t be able to have necessary hip or knee replacements. From that point on my father lost all hope and was just biding his time, waiting for an opportunity to carry out his plans. The last time my father left psychiatric hospital for leave before his suicide he had a conversation with his physiatrist with our family present. The psychiatrist was trying to ascertain the risk of self-harm for my father when on home leave. My father said he wouldn\u2019t try an overdose again, not saying he wouldn\u2019t try another method. The psychiatrist said \u201cMaybe it will be third time lucky Liam!\u201d That statement for me sums up how detached some medical professionals can be, maybe it is how they protect themselves. After my father\u2019s suicide things are a blur. It was as if all the happy memories were pulverized. Childhood milestones, holidays, special occasions all faded away. My only remaining image of my father is him with a pained ashen face, his eyes saying I can\u2019t go on. You try to recall happy memories but all you can focus on is the finality of what happened.\n\nWhen you are feeling bad it is not too difficult to let someone else know this, however when you have lost all hope and a torrent of negative thoughts is leading you to actively plan your demise then the real insidious nature of suicide rears its head and the last thing you will consider doing is letting someone know just how lost you feel.\n\nMy friend Deirdre was very successful academically but struggled feeling the engineering course she was doing was cold and soulless. In correspondence back and over we discussed how banal many of the subjects were and did she really want to end up as an engineer instead of something with more soul like a musician or writer. Deirdre took a year out in 3rd year and worked with IBM. She did well with IBM and returned to Trinity to finish her engineering course and did very well graduating with a first class honours degree. After graduating Deirdre and I didn\u2019t stay in contact as much. A bit like my father I remember seeing her visit me when I was in the intensive unit in a psychiatric hospital in Dublin. I could tell she found it very hard to see me so unwell and I felt she must have wondered was there a risk of her becoming so unwell. Even though Deirdre had seen me in hospital she still never would discuss with me her own mental health or her hopes or fears. After many months of being out of contact with Deirdre I tried to get in touch with her. There was no reply to her phone or email address. Thinking she might have changed jobs I did an internet search for her name. To my horror I came across a Memorial website to Deirdre. Phoning her parents they confirmed the tragic news. Her father told me the story of Deirdre\u2019s last days. Deirdre has been suffering low mood and nothing anybody could do seemed to help. Worried for her safely her parents asked her to come home to Wexford to visit them, otherwise they would have to insist on visiting her in Dublin. That weekend they did everything to try to lift her mood, visiting family and friends and going to shops and restaurants. However Deirdre went back to Dublin. That Monday her mother phoned her at lunch time. Deirdre said she was going to lunch with work colleagues. However the truth was Deirdre had taken a huge overdose of medication that morning, months\u2019 worth of medication she has stopped taking. When her boyfriend returned home that evening Deirdre was dead. You can\u2019t do an autopsy into someone\u2019s state of mind. Deidre had a great job, a steady boyfriend and had just bought a new apartment.\n\nSince my teenage years I have had swings from wildly optimistic grandiose hopes to rock bottom loss of all vestiges of hope. Suicidal ideation can prosper in the absence of hope. Luckily during many of the extreme lows I just try and go into hibernation mode, having a strong belief that if I just get through the oncoming weeks and months then things will have to improve.\n\nOn one occasion for some reason I lost this faith in the future. This wasn\u2019t any kind of impulsive plan or drunken depression. Instead I gradually began to see the future without me as a part of it. I got rid of all my books, got rid of all my CDs and records. I closed bank accounts, I cancelled mailing lists. I booked an appointment with Free Legal Aid with the intention of creating a will.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to cause trouble so my plans revolved around how I could plan my demise with the minimum of pain or distress for my family and friends. I didn\u2019t want my family to have to discover me or call emergency services. So, as I thought, logically, I should get into a body-bag beside the morgue in the hospital. I would be discovered by somebody used to dealing with corpses and it would be a short move into the morgue.\n\nI find it hard to think back and know how I escaped from these suicidal plans. There is somehow Hope to be found at rock bottom depths of depression. From that lowest point I resolved to get well and stay well and to throw everything at the problem. I took personal responsibility for my mental health difficulties. Instead of just relying on medication to work on its own I added other tools to the mix. I did a long course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This helped with the crippling anxiety and negative thoughts I suffered from. I began to get a lot more exercise into my life. I walk my dog every day and go to the gym regularly. I did the Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) course a few times until it became a regular part of my life and a great tool to help me every day. Supports are very important. I have always had great support from my family and friends. However it can sometimes be very difficult to discuss some of these topics with family and friends and I worry about burning them out by talking about the same old issues over and over. This is why I joined a mutual support mental health group called GROW.\n\nI joined GROW in April 2013. My Cognitive Behavior Therapy nurse had recommended it and felt the structured approach to problem-solving would suit me. I have been a very regular attendee at meetings and have led the meetings a number of times. I also enjoyed attending the weekly coffee meetings and the regional conference. In GROW we believe in providing leadership by taking on even small responsibilities. I have a strong interest in Cinema so I took up the responsibility of organising a weekly cinema outing for GROW members. This was a great success and GROW members from all around the country were able to meet up to enjoy a regular night out. I was thrilled to be asked to present a leadership paper at the National Conference during my first year with GROW. My confidence in my abilities has increased and I gladly took on the role of Group Recorder when the position arose. Because of GROW I gained enough confidence to apply for a volunteering position with Age Action to teach IT to the over 55s.\n\nI was the facilitator of my weekly GROW group for over two years and we hold Hope for each other. Last year I took up the opportunity of attending a creative writing class freely given by Galway writer Rita Ann Higgins primarily for GROW members. Our members got the chance to have their poems and short stories published in a booklet and I enjoyed reciting two of my poems at the GROW National Conference in Galway. During the past few years I have also been involved with Advancing Recovery in Ireland (ARI). Service users like myself have been working with HSE staff, and we have been planning the introduction of Recovery Colleges, Peer Support worker positions and Consumer Panels.\n\nSoon after my initial diagnosis my psychiatrist encouraged me to get involved in mental health advocacy work. It would be 15 years later before I did this and found the benefits of it. Last year I completed 12 weeks of training with 4 hours per week work with the Irish Advocacy Network. I am now in the early stages of serving on one of these Consumer Panels as secretary, representing the views of service users in the Galway mental health area.\n\nI am a co-founder of Cos\u00e1in. A wellness centre based in the city. Cos\u00e1in supports people with mental health challenges in identifying and pursuing their own pathways to recovery. Cos\u00e1in is peer led by people with their own experience of mental health challenges and recovery. We work in groups offering:\n\n\nRecovery education\nRecovery through creativity\nPeer support\n\n\nThis month I completed 7 days of training to be a WRAP facilitator. WRAP is a symptom monitoring, crisis planning and self-help mental health recovery programme. It was first developed by Mary Ellen Copeland in the States and was further developed by a group of people who experience mental health difficulties.\n\nI would like to close by reflecting on an element of Recovery we define in GROW. The road to recovery is not always a smooth journey, even lately I have had very anxious thoughts which threaten to cause me to avoid or abandon enjoyable events I had planned to attend. However in GROW we say although \u201cold irrational feelings may return from time to time\u201d in Recovery \u201cthey do not change your thinking or behavior\u201d.\n\nTo paraphrase Mary Ellen Copeland I feel that I have gotten well, I can stay well and I have confidence that I can go on to meet my life dreams and goals. I have Hope.\n\nThank you.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 21:05:32.127085", "updated_at": "2017-11-28 21:05:32.127085", "tag_id": 2122, "post_id": 562, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 529}, {"id": 12905, "text": "", "quote": "Support the Shit Show on Startnext!\u00a0startnext.com/theshitshow\n\nWe have been studying it for 3 months, we have been dealing with it most of our life, we are highly aware of the importance of engaging with it but we still find it incredibly hard to talk about.\n\nPauline and I are both product design students and together with Nele and Luisa who study communications we are team UP. In the context of \"Hacking Utopia\", a human centered design project at the University of Arts Berlin, we are investigating mental health. This article explains our approach of boosting mental resilience and give you the chance to get involved in our project.\n\nIn our previous contributions on Edgeryders we described how we started off with the question of making sadness, unproductivity and inefficiency less shameful. We discovered two TED talks that influenced us greatly: The power of vulnerability by Brene Brown and Depression, the secret we share by Andrew Solomon. As later confirmed by the psychologists we interviewed, these talks made us understand that sharing our feelings is a key step towards mental resilience. Establishing a sustainable, personal connection this is necessary for recovery and growth. When we hide our condition, we ignore it, it becomes worse.\n\nUSER INTERVIEWS\n\nThe issue of mental health is especially important in the context of youth. Young adults are increasingly affected by issues like anxiety or depression. Their circumstances make them particularly susceptible to psychological stress. As many leave the familiar framework of home and school and move into an uncertain future, the newly independents have to find alternative support structures. New living situations, potentially in a new city or even country, starting university or a job, all these developments entail a multitude of mental pressures. In a time where social media is so influential, standards of self-representation are an added factor. According to one of the psychological guidance counsellors at Studentenwerk Berlin; stress, loneliness and self-image issues are very common results among many students.\n\nAs part of our research, we interviewed several university students from different backgrounds about negative emotions like these. One question was how they handle situations of feeling sad, stressed or lonely. The main insight was that everyone experienced this shit, but no one liked to deal with it. A prominent theme in the conversations was the difficulty to talk about emotional problems \u2013 be it a missed project deadline, a loss in the family or an eating disorder. It was mentioned\u00a0that it was easier for them to open up to someone who had similar problems and could empathize. However, it is difficult to identify the people that can offer support\u00a0when everyone tries to hide their struggles.\n\nAs a result, most people\u00a0don\u2019t decide to seek help until they had been in increasing pain for a prolonged amount of time. Yet at this point of outreach, recovery is still far. As we learned from our interviews, it can take months to find care that is suitable to the individual and more months to see any progress. While there is a great spectrum of available options, the general idea of psychological treatment is still stigmatized. It is often not even perceived as a possible solution. The psychologists we interviewed mentioned that many of their patients came to them only after being referred by a general practitioner or friends who had tried therapy themselves.\n\nYet, we cannot force people to seek help. Keeping quiet about insecurities is a justified mental defence mechanism. When we share our feelings, we are vulnerable, exposed. Oftentimes, the recipient is simply not equipped to offer a good, empathic response. This could almost be described as a societal incompetence,\u00a0stemming from a general lack of awareness.\n\nOUR GOAL\n\nWe want\u00a0to challenge the current attitude towards psychological care. Our project tries to de-stigmatize psychological pain and make the sensitive, 'taboo' issue of mental health more present and approachable to the public. We believe that udnerstanding and empathy is vital to provide good care for people that are suffering from emotional distress. We want to make it clear\u00a0that feeling shitty is nothing to be ashamed of, but actually a very common thing. Also, we want the impact of these feelings to be understandable, so that more people can offer informed, helpful responses. When this happens, the threshold of reaching out is lowered, which in return allows problems to be addressed before they develop into serious mental conditions.\n\nINSPIRATION\n\nThere are a number of inspiring projects who deal with exactly this issue of awareness. One clever way artists are spreading awareness is over the internet. Tumblr users like Rubyetc, Beth Evans or Sarah\u2019s Scribbles have gained quite a following with their funny, relatable comics about everyday struggles. Seeing that you are not alone in your suffering can be very comforting. Recently, illustrator Gemma Correll created a series of drawings as part of an online awareness campaign for Mental Health America to visualize what #mentalillnessfeelslike. Their campaign encourages people to open up about their conditions and harvest the power of sharing.\n\nA related approach can be found in the various devices that exist to simulate old age. Suits like \u2018GERT\u2019 are designed to make the wearer feel the impairments that come with aging: stiffness and limited mobility, decreasing strength, blurred sight, muffled hearing. The concept was originally developed to enable caretakers of elderly people to better understand the needs and fears of their patients. Now, gadgets with similar effects, designed by students at Weimar University, are being exhibited at the Hygiene Museum in Dresden, allowing the public to gain the same understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn general, public exhibitions are a valuable source of inspiration when it comes to reaching people and conveying information. A prime example is the 'Happy Show', set up by design firm Sagmeister & Walsh. Verging somewhere between art and education, the show throughly explores the theme of happiness in a graphic, creative and interactive manner. Another show that encourages people to actively engage with the exhibit is Erwin Wurms 'Bei Mutti'. Visitors are isntructed to interact the artefacts on display, effectively becoming a piece of the art themselves.\n\n\nf9e1fc54827667adbc6d98f8ac208de7_1.jpg1920x1080 577 KB\n\n\nPROJECT PROPOSAL\n\nIn order to achieve our goal we propose a combination of an interactive exhibition and an information booth. This pop-up stall can easily be set up at universities events like open days and conferences.\n\nWe will exhibit various sadness simulators, wearable objects for the crowd to try which simulate the effects of being depressed, stressed or anxious. These objects have been inspired by an online survey we have conducted in order to find out how people physically feel when they are in emotional distress. Out of dozens of responses we have extracted the most common themes: weight on the shoulders, head pulling down, brain fog and a general discomfort in one's body feeling: hot, sticky and itchy. With these results we have designed various objects: A neck bender, a very heavy device to carry on his back being forced to lean forward. A helmet made of tinted transparent acrylic that simulates looking through a veil and muffles the sound of the surroundings and a really uncomfortable ill-fitting coat made of a super itchy and stiff fabric. We have more ideas but for now we have realized these three.\n\nThose who are\u00a0brave enough to test our simulators will receive a positive feedback. They will get to choose between 3 gifts: Stickers that encourage everyday task such as: \"got out of bad\", \"took a shower\" and \"washed my laundry\" in order to demonstrate how difficult these tasks can be to certain people. They could also choose comforting cynical tea bags that they can grant a friend in need on a rainy day or shit shaped chocolate pralines to compensate for the horrors they have just been through. The exhibition will also include an interactive board in which participants can share their feelings caused by the simulators or just generally and a second board presenting useful information regarding mental issues: how to identify, approachable treatments, support groups and other solutions. The first exhibition will take place during Berlin University of the Arts Semester end's exhibition and we hope it will continue to other universities around berlin and even in other cities in Europe.\n\nIf you hope so as well you are welcome to join us in a number of ways:\n\n\nSupport our Startnext campaign going online July 20th! Help us fund the first ever Shit Show and enjoy our moody merchandise (link tba)\nSpread the word! Our first intention is to raise awareness of mental health issues. Please share our ideas and solutions, you might even help someone.\n\n\n(It will also be nice if you would share our Startnext campaign once it's up \n\nParticipate our research, tell us how you feel when you are down in our survey or just share with us your Ideas and comments.

I went to a rural all boys National School and was in a small class of 8 boys. My memories of that time are mostly of playing lots of sports and having the craic (Irish word for fun) with my fellow students. There was no bullying whatsoever, indeed bullying was something I didn\u2019t know existed until I went to secondary school. This period in my life was the classic definition of Childhood Innocence.\n\nFrom my first year in secondary school I was quite successful academically. Even though I was quite happy at school I found the weekends and holidays from school difficult. I would never see my classmates at the weekends or at Christmas, Easter or summer holidays. This was the start of the first time I ever felt feelings of depression. It was before the time of email, or mobile phones or social media. These times were times of complete and utter isolation from my friends. In these dismal days I used to study hard, write melancholic poetry and just postpone my happiness to when I would be finished my Leaving Cert (Irish exams) and be able to escape to a distant University. I did feel the presence of Hope. I felt I could suffer and suffer during those teenage years and that things would be better when I moved on to University. Where did my hope stem from? I was very academic and had dreams of becoming a mathematician or a poet or a political activist. I fantasised about being as prolific and brilliant as Yeats or Da Vinci.\n\nWhen I was awarded a place in Engineering in Trinity I moved to Dublin. I was unhappy with my Engineering course and after a few weeks stopped attending and instead just led a party life, drinking for the first time. I started to feel very isolated and depressed but I didn\u2019t tell my family or friends the true extent of my feelings.\n\nI recall writing very black poetry at this time and feeling a strong sense of failure.\u00a0 At that end of term I formally withdrew from the Engineering course and returned to home in Galway.\n\nWhile I was in Dublin I met Deirdre who was studying the same course as me. From the first meeting we hit it off and developed a very strong platonic relationship. Even though we both would end up being diagnosed with the same bipolar label Deirdre and I never discussed mental health issues. We would go to pubs and gigs together and discuss music, poetry, philosophy and other topics. When I moved back to Galway we corresponded by snail mail, sending each other long handwritten letters and photocopies of poems and inspiring song lyrics. While we didn\u2019t discuss depression or medication Deirdre and I both were able to express to each other how black our lives could feel. I guess you could say we held Hope for each other.\n\nThat Christmas my health deteriorated and I acquired glandular fever. After a short hospital stay I returned home to suffer months of crippling fatigue. I have battled with severe fatigue ever since.\u00a0 I was ill for most of that year and was idle until I won a place in Information Technology in the University in Galway. Even though I was living at home I was very happy to attend this course. I found this University more relaxed and got on very well with my classmates. For some reason I suffered a breakdown during my final term of my degree. I didn\u2019t tell friends or family but had meetings with some of the lecturers to see could I postpone my final exams.\n\nI found my mind was racing and I felt I needed very little sleep. I also used alcohol to help me relax and unwind from the racing thoughts. Since my father was Bipolar my parents recognised these symptoms and persuaded me to see a G.P. to deal with them. After a short meeting with my family G.P. he recognised the classic symptoms of mania and set up an appointment to see a psychiatrist. That psychiatrist whom I saw for 13 years admitted me to hospital.\n\nI suffer from Bipolar 1, meaning I suffer very high highs or mania, and very suicidal lows. When I get my highs medication seems to have very little effect on me. Instead it is a case of spending months in the safe confines of a hospital until the mania subsides. When I have my lows I get very suicidal and on two separate admissions for depression I have had to resort to Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) to treat my severe depression. There is quite a lot of controversy over ECT. I believe that it is a useful treatment of last resort. When a patient is in hospital and has been suicidal and catatonic with depression for many weeks with various medications being tried to no avail then I think ECT should be considered.\n\nIn the past 14 years since my first hospital admission I have had perhaps 4 or 5 admissions for mania and 2 or 3 for depression. Thankfully I have managed to avoid admission to hospital for the past 6 years except for six nights in summer last year.\n\nMany of us have lost loved ones to suicide. The loss is devastating. I lost my father and my friend Deirdre to suicide. My father had been diagnosed with Bipolar and suffered from the condition from middle-age. Looking back I can see the times he was manic or high, singing loudly on the half hour drive to school where he taught every day. I vividly remember during my teenage years his first admission to psychiatric hospital my Dad weeping with happiness when he was released home on leave for a few days at Christmas.\n\nDad snapped one day in school and that was the end of his teaching career. From that point on he had two overdose attempts. He had gone undiagnosed for the physical illness Haemochromatosis for many years and this aggravated his severe arthritis. My father was in severe pain. Unfortunately his Consultant gave him the news that his arthritis was so severe that he wouldn\u2019t be able to have necessary hip or knee replacements. From that point on my father lost all hope and was just biding his time, waiting for an opportunity to carry out his plans. The last time my father left psychiatric hospital for leave before his suicide he had a conversation with his physiatrist with our family present. The psychiatrist was trying to ascertain the risk of self-harm for my father when on home leave. My father said he wouldn\u2019t try an overdose again, not saying he wouldn\u2019t try another method. The psychiatrist said \u201cMaybe it will be third time lucky Liam!\u201d That statement for me sums up how detached some medical professionals can be, maybe it is how they protect themselves. After my father\u2019s suicide things are a blur. It was as if all the happy memories were pulverized. Childhood milestones, holidays, special occasions all faded away. My only remaining image of my father is him with a pained ashen face, his eyes saying I can\u2019t go on. You try to recall happy memories but all you can focus on is the finality of what happened.\n\nWhen you are feeling bad it is not too difficult to let someone else know this, however when you have lost all hope and a torrent of negative thoughts is leading you to actively plan your demise then the real insidious nature of suicide rears its head and the last thing you will consider doing is letting someone know just how lost you feel.\n\nMy friend Deirdre was very successful academically but struggled feeling the engineering course she was doing was cold and soulless. In correspondence back and over we discussed how banal many of the subjects were and did she really want to end up as an engineer instead of something with more soul like a musician or writer. Deirdre took a year out in 3rd year and worked with IBM. She did well with IBM and returned to Trinity to finish her engineering course and did very well graduating with a first class honours degree. After graduating Deirdre and I didn\u2019t stay in contact as much. A bit like my father I remember seeing her visit me when I was in the intensive unit in a psychiatric hospital in Dublin. I could tell she found it very hard to see me so unwell and I felt she must have wondered was there a risk of her becoming so unwell. Even though Deirdre had seen me in hospital she still never would discuss with me her own mental health or her hopes or fears. After many months of being out of contact with Deirdre I tried to get in touch with her. There was no reply to her phone or email address. Thinking she might have changed jobs I did an internet search for her name. To my horror I came across a Memorial website to Deirdre. Phoning her parents they confirmed the tragic news. Her father told me the story of Deirdre\u2019s last days. Deirdre has been suffering low mood and nothing anybody could do seemed to help. Worried for her safely her parents asked her to come home to Wexford to visit them, otherwise they would have to insist on visiting her in Dublin. That weekend they did everything to try to lift her mood, visiting family and friends and going to shops and restaurants. However Deirdre went back to Dublin. That Monday her mother phoned her at lunch time. Deirdre said she was going to lunch with work colleagues. However the truth was Deirdre had taken a huge overdose of medication that morning, months\u2019 worth of medication she has stopped taking. When her boyfriend returned home that evening Deirdre was dead. You can\u2019t do an autopsy into someone\u2019s state of mind. Deidre had a great job, a steady boyfriend and had just bought a new apartment.\n\nSince my teenage years I have had swings from wildly optimistic grandiose hopes to rock bottom loss of all vestiges of hope. Suicidal ideation can prosper in the absence of hope. Luckily during many of the extreme lows I just try and go into hibernation mode, having a strong belief that if I just get through the oncoming weeks and months then things will have to improve.\n\nOn one occasion for some reason I lost this faith in the future. This wasn\u2019t any kind of impulsive plan or drunken depression. Instead I gradually began to see the future without me as a part of it. I got rid of all my books, got rid of all my CDs and records. I closed bank accounts, I cancelled mailing lists. I booked an appointment with Free Legal Aid with the intention of creating a will.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to cause trouble so my plans revolved around how I could plan my demise with the minimum of pain or distress for my family and friends. I didn\u2019t want my family to have to discover me or call emergency services. So, as I thought, logically, I should get into a body-bag beside the morgue in the hospital. I would be discovered by somebody used to dealing with corpses and it would be a short move into the morgue.\n\nI find it hard to think back and know how I escaped from these suicidal plans. There is somehow Hope to be found at rock bottom depths of depression. From that lowest point I resolved to get well and stay well and to throw everything at the problem. I took personal responsibility for my mental health difficulties. Instead of just relying on medication to work on its own I added other tools to the mix. I did a long course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This helped with the crippling anxiety and negative thoughts I suffered from. I began to get a lot more exercise into my life. I walk my dog every day and go to the gym regularly. I did the Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) course a few times until it became a regular part of my life and a great tool to help me every day. Supports are very important. I have always had great support from my family and friends. However it can sometimes be very difficult to discuss some of these topics with family and friends and I worry about burning them out by talking about the same old issues over and over. This is why I joined a mutual support mental health group called GROW.\n\nI joined GROW in April 2013. My Cognitive Behavior Therapy nurse had recommended it and felt the structured approach to problem-solving would suit me. I have been a very regular attendee at meetings and have led the meetings a number of times. I also enjoyed attending the weekly coffee meetings and the regional conference. In GROW we believe in providing leadership by taking on even small responsibilities. I have a strong interest in Cinema so I took up the responsibility of organising a weekly cinema outing for GROW members. This was a great success and GROW members from all around the country were able to meet up to enjoy a regular night out. I was thrilled to be asked to present a leadership paper at the National Conference during my first year with GROW. My confidence in my abilities has increased and I gladly took on the role of Group Recorder when the position arose. Because of GROW I gained enough confidence to apply for a volunteering position with Age Action to teach IT to the over 55s.\n\nI was the facilitator of my weekly GROW group for over two years and we hold Hope for each other. Last year I took up the opportunity of attending a creative writing class freely given by Galway writer Rita Ann Higgins primarily for GROW members. Our members got the chance to have their poems and short stories published in a booklet and I enjoyed reciting two of my poems at the GROW National Conference in Galway. During the past few years I have also been involved with Advancing Recovery in Ireland (ARI). Service users like myself have been working with HSE staff, and we have been planning the introduction of Recovery Colleges, Peer Support worker positions and Consumer Panels.\n\nSoon after my initial diagnosis my psychiatrist encouraged me to get involved in mental health advocacy work. It would be 15 years later before I did this and found the benefits of it. Last year I completed 12 weeks of training with 4 hours per week work with the Irish Advocacy Network. I am now in the early stages of serving on one of these Consumer Panels as secretary, representing the views of service users in the Galway mental health area.\n\nI am a co-founder of Cos\u00e1in. A wellness centre based in the city. Cos\u00e1in supports people with mental health challenges in identifying and pursuing their own pathways to recovery. Cos\u00e1in is peer led by people with their own experience of mental health challenges and recovery. We work in groups offering:\n\n\nRecovery education\nRecovery through creativity\nPeer support\n\n\nThis month I completed 7 days of training to be a WRAP facilitator. WRAP is a symptom monitoring, crisis planning and self-help mental health recovery programme. It was first developed by Mary Ellen Copeland in the States and was further developed by a group of people who experience mental health difficulties.\n\nI would like to close by reflecting on an element of Recovery we define in GROW. The road to recovery is not always a smooth journey, even lately I have had very anxious thoughts which threaten to cause me to avoid or abandon enjoyable events I had planned to attend. However in GROW we say although \u201cold irrational feelings may return from time to time\u201d in Recovery \u201cthey do not change your thinking or behavior\u201d.\n\nTo paraphrase Mary Ellen Copeland I feel that I have gotten well, I can stay well and I have confidence that I can go on to meet my life dreams and goals. I have Hope.\n\nThank you.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 21:07:14.827535", "updated_at": "2017-11-28 21:07:14.827535", "tag_id": 2122, "post_id": 562, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 529}, {"id": 12907, "text": "", "quote": "We missed you @Woodbinehealth , welcome back.

This story serves as a first encounter with Edgeryders. It also includes written reflections by Vanessa.\n\nWeMHNurses hosts regular mental health themed twitter chats, as part of a network chat calendar, with wildly diverse topics ranging from \u201cThe use of digital technology in everyday practice\u201d to \u201cWorkplace democracy in mental health\u201d. The core team runs the day to day operations, on a purely voluntary basis, with the WeMHNurses account, also linking into the wider WeCommunities, which covers many different branches of Nursing and Health Care professions and specialism. Topics for chats tend to mostly emerge from topical conversations within the community or where there is, for example a national policy directive or key piece of published journalism relating to mental health. The community also run sponsored chats for national bodies such as the Dept of Health, Care Quality Commission and NHS England. The WeMHNurses team see their role as being about facilitating broader conversation in a democratised digital space, where everyone can have a voice, regardless of positional authority. The team also see their role as being to make national policy more accessible, in terms of the language being used. The community also has a particular focus on discussing the everyday implications of policy on mental health nursing practice.\n\nThe chats are generally facilitated by one of the @WeMHNurses team, with guests are often invited to participate in the chat where the person brings specific expertise to the conversation. This is an open process, whereby anyone can contact the team to suggest a chat topic or to ask to host a chat.The team provide support to individuals who want to host a chat from the @WeMHNurses Twitter handle.\n\nOur ethos is very much that \u201cyour opinion matters\u201d and we focus on the user point of view, getting people talking to each other and bringing a variety of perspectives to the conversation. We enjoy working with people who have previously been in services or are currently in services because we really value the lived experience perspective. As we are an independent voice, we will also cover topics that might be considered controversial, political or critical, as we believe that these conversations are important in setting the future direction for mental health nursing.\n\nOn reflection, we think that the liveliest and most informative chats are often where there is a real mixture of perspectives, including for example, clinicians, people accessing services, managers, leaders, academics, researchers and policy makers. The conversations that we have online are often very powerful for this reason as we can\u2019t think of many examples from our own professional lives, where there has been such a variety of voices in a room to debate a topic in such a level and democratic way. An example of this is a chat that Vanessa and Mark ran with the Health Service Journal, where we discussed the reduction of inpatient mental health beds across the country. This chat was very much brought to life by people sharing their experiences of how this impacted on them personally when they needed to access inpatient care.\n\nThe demographics for our chat suggest that we have a largely UK audience. However, because of the global reach of Twitter, we do have some international representation within our community and we love to encourage this because of the dimension that it brings to the conversation\n\nBefore we run a chat, we produce some pre chat information on the wecommunities website. This is generally written in a blog style, so it is broadly accessible reading. We are also looking at how we can make our chats even more inclusive, such as by providing audio for people who struggle to read or who have visual impairment. The challenge for us is that we are all volunteers, so we have to find ways of delivering information quickly.\n\nHow come this twitter format for talking about mental health? Is there something in the medium that helps learning, or alleviation for individuals?\n\nAs with everything there are always pros and cons. Some would say \u201cthere\u2019s only so many characters on twitter\u201d and mental health can be a very complex topic to discuss with limited characters, especially when people are talking about personal experience. On the other hand, it can help you be more focused and concise in what you are trying to say.\n\nI suppose using twitter to talk about mental health is quite personal, as is twitter use in general. There are many who find it hugely therapeutic and helpful, either getting involved in chats, communicating/ networking with others or for gaining support. It is a fab place for the sharing of information, including research and it's also a great forum for challenging stigma and moving the mental health agenda forward.\n\n\nWeMHNurses1_0.png900x480 120 KB\n\n\nWordcloud from\u00a0participants twitter bios in a recent chat -\u00a0source.\n\nIs there a cutoff number for participants in a chat? Or a number that makes it effective? I\u2019m wondering because you have such high regularity - every week.\n\nThere is not a maximum number of people in each chat, it can be anybody using the hashtag. Often people pop into the chat with just one or two tweets, whilst at the same time, we are having a conversation with other people, who participate in the entirety of the chat. When you are facilitating a chat, which is busy, it can be a challenge responding to every single tweet, but we do try to do this and often we find that people branch off and have separate conversations with other participants, within the chat, which goes down a different path to the structured questions of the main chat. Providing they still use the hashtag, we still capture this conversation in the transcript at the end. This is an example of the latest archived chat on a Tuesday evening, counting 133 contributors, 1200 tweets and with a reach of 7,561,098! This was a joint chat with @wenurses and @weldnurses.\n\nWith our over 6000 followers, plus the wider network, I suppose it is hard to say how many people we reach constantly. However, analytics for the chat are captured within the wecommunities website. Nick Chinn is the technical person behind this at Wecommunities.\n\nWhat do you think draws people in? What makes it a community for you? Is it people interacting with each other, learning, figuring out stuff?\n\nI suppose it is all of that. Everyone involved in the chats is interested in that particular area and that shared interest drives the discussions and questions in the chat, which will often support the development of links between people. Often people in the chats might say: \u2018this is a good chat\u2019, and \u2018why don\u2019t we do one on this other topic area?\u2019 It then keeps expanding, and there are more things that we get involved in. So, in essence, the community is about sharing knowledge and learning, being open to thinking in different ways and developing a support network as well.\n\nWhat for the future and how can we support your work?\n\nWe are\u00a0very aware that people establish relationships and friendships offline with people who they have connected with on Twitter and that these relationships are often a great source of strength and support for people. Vanessa and Teresa Chinn, Founder of WeCommunities organised an unConference earlier in the year, through crowdfunding, which brought together 300 people from the community into a physical space to get together and to debate and discuss the future direction of social media in health care. We also provided a parallel online agenda throughout the day, so that the twitter community could still very much be part of it, even if they couldn\u2019t physically attend.

I left several comments and questions, but did not manage to get a conversation going (yet?). \"\n\nReally thanks for pointing this out. This actually aligns with 2 questions that I have in mind:\n\nWe asked the students to share their ideas, in order to help them document, and help us share the work we are doing,  1. Moving on what should be the value of sharing stories, besides documentation?\u00a0 \n\nDo we agree that the idea of having the \"conversation going\" without having clear aim of what to expect as an outcome of the conversation, makes it hard for people to engage.\n\n\"Maybe because the same user, @wave , has authored most of those posts \u2013 the poor guy or girl must be superbusy! \"\n\nThey were busy, of course, but despite their being designers, it also took them a long while to figure out how the platform works, how to react to notifications etc. I am not saying there is something that we need to fix about UI, just acknolwdging the fact that onboarding newcomers is time consuming and not very efficient.\n\n\"With all this great, very practical work it would be a shame not to be able to extract the \"how to\" from it. \u00a0Specifically, we are interested in the community element of these solutions.\"\n\nThe community element you mean here is bringing the students as community members to the platform? The only concern here is that, this is done in context of a school assignment, so there were formal excersices in order to help students formulate these ideas, and we also had tech factors controlling which idea we go for in terms of implementation.\u00a0 The nightscout story is very personal, it is not possible to expect the same narrative from a school exercise, even though two of the projects were inspired by real stories. (well, this is how our excercise helped them tackle issue that they actually \"care\"about, when possible)\n\nOn the other hand,\u00a0 we met people at the makerfaire, with \"real\" stories that they need to tackle. For example parents of kids with certain needs, or people who are part of certain communities who need to look for ideas for certain problems, we want to help them outline their stories and connect them with people who have implemented solutions for it, or parts of the solution, and whom they just don't know they exist. The online scenarios is that people post a story and they leave it there, until organically, someone finds it (or not) then a real conversation starts, online or offline. The other scenario, is that we poke both parties, offline (or in another channel) and we ask them to carry on the conversation on the platform. Assuming that we will stick to the second scenario, and keeping in mind the on-boarding challenge which we have seen, do you think the \"share your story\" model is something that we will keep? Do we need an ongoing repository of stories? Or we need to move to find a structured way to have an \"objective\" conversation, that has clear outcome?\u00a0 What do you think?\n\nAnalyzing Berlin example that again, this is documentation of an existing, on-going, effort that has an offline plan. The comments are adding helpful links or giving thumbs up. I am not saying that this is not helpful, but we need to agree that this is falls on the rails of \"documentation and feedback\" and not \"matching possibilities online\" and the more we continue adding stories to an open repository with our current setting, then this is the model of engagement we are following, and which we need to acknowledge.", "created_at": "2017-11-29 17:56:08.504531", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:40.192236", "tag_id": 1143, "post_id": 19968, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 5949}, {"id": 12912, "text": "", "quote": "Thanks @Amelia \u2013 much needed. In the coming phase of opencare you'll be fairly central, because we do need the ethnographic data, and people need to know what consititutes \"good\" ethnographic data. opencare is funded by DG CNECT (formerly known as DG Information Society); more specifically, by the Collective Awareness Platforms Programme. This program funds research on how online platforms can be used to elicit collectively intelligent responses. Putting a project on a website does not qualify as collective intelligence: in the proposal, we have argued that online conversation\u00a0around\u00a0a project does. That is what we promised to do. Of course, discussion does not always catch on: that's well understood. But on the whole, we should have enough conversation to be able to argue that ours is a really collective process.\n\nI think that is defensible: we have 323 posts and 1,423 comments authored by 201 people, so an average of over\u00a0four comments per post. 13 threads have 20 comments or more, two of them started by Berlin students. This translates into a social network with 201 nodes and 766 edges.

So far, we have followed\u00a0two different approaches:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0ScImpulse, WeMake and City of Milano focus on an engaging offline experience for participants. Conveners take notes, photos etc. They then editorialize them and upload them onto the platform.\n\n\nEdgeryders focus on offering people with good stories help for them to put them on the platform. Workshops are organized not by Edgeryders itself (though we do take part), but by active community members. The same also provide most of the help.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBoth methods are hard. Both have drawbacks.\n\nThe first method is mostly failing. It is difficult to make sense of notes taken during the meeting. I had this experience during \"Taking care\", where I volunteered to take notes with Cristina. Afterwards, I could interpret my notes, but not hers (though we were using the same \u00a0Google Doc! ). I imagine the opposite was true for her. Many notes never make it online. Those that do take the form of a report: \"A said this, B said that\". The community tends not to engage with this type of format.\u00a0\n\nThe second method has given better results.\u00a0\u00a0Still,\u00a0it discourages people who are not good communicators in writing, face language barriers etc.\u00a0\n\nHow to move forward? The Milan meeting gave us two promising leads.\n\nThe first one was offered by @costantino and @alessandrocontini . They pointed out that the mechanics of makers collaboration is not so social. You go to the forum, ask a question, get a pointer, solve the problem and move on. It may be difficult to track it through an online forum.\n\nThe second one results from\u00a0something interesting that happened during \"Taking care\". This: people in the Bordeaux group at some point felt their contribution was unnecessary and possibly unwelcome. They withdrew from the workshop and moved to a different room. They kept working on opencare, but in the form of writing code to look at the conversation.\u00a0\n\nThis resonates with an Edgeryders\u00a0conversation thread\u00a0that predates opencare.\u00a0It says this: the \"meeting\"\u00a0or \"assembly\" format claims to be inclusive, but in fact it is not. Instead, it rewards extrovert, confident, even narcissistic personalities. Introverts don't like to speak in public,\u00a0certainly not without thinking things through. So they never speak. This issue has come to the fore in the hacker community, where many skilled developers identify as intros. Intros like online, where they can take time to think things through, and where they do not have to interrupt others to claim space.\u00a0See for example\u00a0this great comment\u00a0by @trythis\u00a0and the thread that comes with it. As a result, offline spaces are exclusionary. They do not know it...\u00a0because they exclude\u00a0the people who never speak up.\u00a0\n\nThe post-it workshop format has a\u00a0second potential problem. It has no space for\u00a0contributions\u00a0in\u00a0forms other than the speech (as Cicero describes in\u00a0De Oratore). The role of facilitators is to \"standardize\" contributions. Some people (like @Noemi in \"Taking care\") feel that this negates serendipity and predetermines results.\n\nIf this is true, a lot of design-based methods of engagement have a serious flaw. What's worse, an\u00a0unacknowledged\u00a0one. Given their popularity, this is serious.\n\nSo, I propose we\u00a0\"go deep\", doing research and producing one or more papers on:\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ethnography of makers collaboration. How important is the space? How important is StackOverflow or similar? What constitues \"good\" collaboration (Alessandro: \"the less interactive and more efficient, the better\")?\u00a0\n\n\n\nA model of the interface between online and\u00a0offline collaboration. We promised to build this anyway in the proposal.\n\n\n\nA critique of the post-it workshop as a technique for collective intelligence.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAll of this should, in my opinion, have a design perspective. I propose that @Ezio_Manzini coordinates the activities and writes one or two papers under items 2 and 3.\u00a0ER would be happy to support this.\u00a0And I would love to see WeMake and ScImpulse appoint an ethnographer to look into item 1.\u00a0\n\nThoughts?\n              \n  \n  \n    \n    Edit\n    Delete\n  \nNo Commentbringing offline content online\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2017-11-29 18:01:16.259606", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:40.220732", "tag_id": 1143, "post_id": 6069, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6036}, {"id": 12919, "text": "", "quote": "Quite a few curious people who participate in the OpenCare conversation\u00a0about care\u00a0end up engaging with the research team in a different conversation: the one\u00a0about OpenCare as a research project.\u00a0This is a lovely\u00a0side effect of OpenCare's radical transparency. We practice a sort of open notebook science.\u00a0We don't publish only results, but also questions, doubts, within-team disagreements, half-baked ideas. This is made more effective by a specificity of OpenCare:\u00a0the community and the team are in separate \"rooms\" of the same online platform, edgeryders.eu. People who hang around it\u00a0can't help noticing the stream of research project updates. Some of them engage.\u00a0\n\nThis was expected. But I was not expecting the magnitude of the effect. 81 people have contributed at least one comment to the research team space. The team's own numerosity fluctuates, but it's about 20. The others are just people from the community who drop in to ask questions or make suggestions. And they outnumber us three to one.\n\nIn the network diagrams, nodes are color- and size coded by in-degree. You can think of in-degree as a measure of the interest that the person's contribution elicits in the conversation. By this metric, it is clear that self-selected community members who just jump in\u00a0are making a major contribution to the OpenCare research effort. The highest in-degree individuals who are not affiliated with any of the partners are @Federico_Monaco (ranks 7th by in-degree), @Rune (ranks 13th) and @Francesco_Maria_ZAVA (ranks 16th).\u00a0\n\nThe conversation about\u00a0OpenCare as a project (to the right of the picture)\u00a0is of the same order of magnitude as that about open care as a potential pathway to societal well-being (to the left). It needs to be said, however, that the former has a lot of menial content: agreeing about a time and place to meet, requesting administrative information etc. \u00a0\n\nWhat are the consequences of all this activity? More diversity in research. More space for participation. With a bit of luck, more and higher quality scientific output.\u00a0My favourite story is this: a community member, the already mentioned Federico Monaco, has proposed we do a paper together. He had found a call for papers in a journal he follows, and thought it a good fit. His proposal stirred the rest of the team into action. His thread received over 50 comments. A\u00a0draft abstract was then uploaded onto a public wiki\u00a0for community scrutiny and feedback.\n\nMany people sent contributions large and small. The large ones (example: that of\u00a0Ezio \u2013 here) did most of the heavy lifting. But the process had a role also for smaller ones. People like myself, who did not feel confident to step in as co-authors, were able to offer some small help\u00a0without having to take responsbility for the whole thing. Federico led with a firm but light touch, asking everyone who volunteered any thought what role they wanted to play in the paper. For example, @Yannick \u2013 also\u00a0not\u00a0a member of the OpenCare team \u2013 was offered co-authorship (but declined). All of this happened out in the open. As you\u00a0read the whole thread, you can see ideas form through the discussion of the co-authors. Collective intelligence about collective intelligence!\u00a0\n\nInterdisciplinarity happened quite naturally as a result of the open process. The final submission listed five authors: Federico himself (a medical anthropologist); @Ezio_Manzini (a designer for social innovation); @Noemi (a social scientist); @Amelia (an ethnographer); myself (a network scientist). How cool is that?\n\nAnother advantage of doing things this way is increased accountability to the people who take part\u00a0in the main conversation, the one about care. Through the research team forum, they can ask question and make proposals. This should mitigate the perceived risk of researchers taking an exploitative attitude towards people's contributions. The operative word here is \"perceived\". We have the best intentions, but we recognize this is not enough. We are determined to demonstrate them to the community, and transparency goes a long way towards doing it.\u00a0\n\nI think that, together, we are making OpenCare... open.

We started our project RefugeesWork to help newcomers to connect with locals who are looking for freelancers to outsource some work to them.\n\nIt all started in August 2015 when lots of newcomers, mainly from Syria, arrived to Germany.\n\nIt now turns out that it\u2019s not very easy for them to find any kind of employment at all. German companies seem to not need the skills they bring to the table and even if they do have what they are looking for, they often reject people who do not speak German well.\n\nWe decided to use our digital skills, first of all programming, to help them. We developed a marketplace app where on one side newcomers can register and describe their skills and on the other side local organizations can post their requests for freelancers. We believe work is the best pathway to connect refugees and locals and to date, we have over 300 registrations on the site and big community in Berlin and online. Those Syrians come from all walks of life and some have excellent background, or were running their own business.\n\nBut we also realized that freelance requests are mostly for freelancers with web and mobile development background. These are the jobs freelancers can do online, they don't need to speak the local language and because all the organizations are trying to automate their processes, there is actually a big need for these professions. We checked our database and available statistics and figured out that most of newcomers are young, they just finished their high school or had to leave in the middle of their studies so they actually lack necessary skills to integrate into the highly specialized German job market. Freelancing would give refugees freedom from discrimination they would face otherwise and freelancers are usually paid way better. The tricky part is in making sure there is a regular flow of work. That is our experience.\n\n\nRefugeeswork.jpg960x638 84.1 KB\n\n\nTherefore we decided to extend our Berlin based coding school for kids and use our experiences to create online e-learning platform to teach newcomers programming: from how to install browser to how to build your mobile app. All the learners can learn digital skills/programming no matter where they are, they get 24/7 support on the chat from mentors and other learners and later and they can apply for projects companies outsource through RefugeesWork. All the learners become part of digital collective Coding Amigos, that we started with international crew of developers with activist streak already 3 years ago. We meet in Berlin 2x a week and co-work together on client projects or our own apps that we in long term want to connect in a circular economy. For us - even though circular economy is usually connected to recycling - that means that supply chains form supply circles and money is not loaned by governments and other usual suspects and end up in always the same pockets who save it and don\u2019t even know what to do with all the money.\n\nCurrently we are also following the work of Sensorica in Canada and Enspiral in New Zealand. Our wish is to create a micro-holding co-ownership model. One part of the motivation is to shield these professionals from all kinds of discrimination that they might otherwise experience.\n\nIt shields them, for example from the usual politicking among corporate employees who might tend to put such newcomers into a fairly low place. And another part of the motivation is exploring processes and legal ways for cooperation and decision making between many micro-holdings.\n\nWe try to list all our initiatives inside of Github organization SquatUp.\n\nWe try to keep all our work open and transparent for which we for now use Github.com, Gitter.im and Waffle.io which allow us versioned storing our documents, including code, working on issues on a kanban board and use open communication on a public chat.\n\nAll our projects are made with zero budget so with pure love and dedication for our mission: open source & transparency, inclusiveness, digital literacy and open organization. It is not easy, but we don't want to waste our time chasing funding and investors or clients, but instead co-create the world we want to live in. And we believe right people and opportunities will come from that and from the people that share the mindset and want to join us.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make a living with all of this, so we just try to live as cheap as possible and we work for a better future where society is organized differently utilizing radical transparency and open source. Until then we live from savings that we sometimes manage to build when working on paid projects. By empowering refugees with skills we hope they will later become our partners and continue to help us build an alternative work. On top of that, we might manage to get in projects on a more regular basis and outsource paid work to each other.\n\nSo if you are a programmer, \u201dapptivist\u201d, please consider reaching out and connect your apps to our ecosystem via API or help us build an open ecosystem of related apps.\n\nIf you know anyone who did not yet start to learn programming, please tell them to join us in http://gitter.im/codingamigos/learners so they can get started for free immediately. We offer 24/7 support for free to get learners from zero to be able to create their first mobile app within a couple of weeks up to a few months given learners are disciplined and learn full time.\n\nAnd last but not least, if you can bring in paid IT projects to support our voluntary efforts, the community of learners and our effort to prototype alternative ways of organizing and working together, we would appreciate it a lot. Everyone who successfully brings in a project and helps us communicating with the customer during the project will be transparently included in the sharing of the revenue.\n\nThe production of this article was supported by Op3n Fellowships - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.\n\nLinks:\n\nRefugeesWork - www.refugeeswork.com\n\nOnline JavaScript school - www.wizardamigos.com\n\nCoding Amigos meetup - www.meetup.com/codingamigos\n\nCoding Amigos collective - www.codingamigos.com\n\nSquatUp - https://github.com/SquatUp/projects/blob/master/README.md\n\nNina Breznik - @ninabreznik\n\nAlexander Praetorius - @serapath", "created_at": "2017-11-29 18:06:23.992206", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:40.366652", "tag_id": 1150, "post_id": 769, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 736}, {"id": 12929, "text": "", "quote": "Hello peeps,\n\nThis is my first post in this community\u2026.\n\nSo no completely sure yet how it works or what kind of responses I will get.\n\nHere my story and my question:\n\nBecause I took into my household 1,5 years ago, a 17 year old Iraqi boy (refugee) I am becoming, a little bit against my own will\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/images/emoji.php/v8/zfb/1/16/263a.png\">, a go to, ask to, for other Iraqis, around the globe\u2026\n\nHis mother, on her way to Belgium, Brussels, on a \u201cfamily reunion visa\u201d, was professor in History at the Mosul university.

Is it for the student status/visa? Or for the need to receive economic support? If their titles/certificates are at hand (which I presume, since they do not want to enrol in a bachelor, but in a doctorate), why not seeking a professional position (lecturer, lab technician, ...)?

Is usually delegated to the patients the duty of providing the accurate information about their health condition every visit.\n\n\n\tThe missing digitalization of the gathered health data and the consequent discontinuity of the healing process.\n\n\n\tThe limited precision of the anamnestic research due to the high number of patients and the short time available.\n\n\n\n\n\tFinal User, individuals and\u00a0community target\n\n\n\n\nResQ is conceived to ease the communication among physicians (involved in critical context such as emergency hospitals and refugees reception centers) regarding the health state of foreigner patients who don\u2019t know the language of the hosting country.

Also, the digitalization of such a document would make possible an extensive sharing with colleagues that later will take care of the same patient.\n\nTherefore the physician will have the chance to communicate autonomously among themselves without misunderstanding through the management tool.\n\n\nResQ-board.jpg2045x2500 640 KB\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTechnologies we will adopt\n\n\n\n\nThe tool we are designing will be developed in order to be accessible from the main devices available on the market.

I\u2019m a keen cyclist for transport and leisure, but my profession is also research in devices enhancing the mobility for people with physical limitations. Therefore I feel an obligation to spread the news about recent advancements in cycling for physically challenged. Have you heard about FES cycling?\n\nFES - short for functional electrical stimulation - can be used to activate paralyzed muscles by impulses imitating the nervous system in the most natural way possible. We have come a long way with our research and it is possible to use this technique to let people with paralyzed legs cycle again. For some reason there are very few people who know about this so I\u2019d like to share this knowledge with you.\n\nWe cycle to move, but also to maintain fit. It can be both fun and functional. But, if your legs don't obey you anymore, you will probably not consider it a possibility. Paralyzed legs can result from an accident breaking your back, a stroke or a sneaking disease like the multiple sclerosis. \u00a0\n\nPeople caring for and curing you need to be very pragmatic, and you with them. Mobility then becomes reduced to passive transport, a dietetic approach to avoiding getting fat and medication of pressure sores and other side effects from lack of physical exercise. That\u2019s where the publicly unknown FES research comes into play. Years of clinical research have consolidated the benefits, but we need to spread the news and understand more about it. Some people may already have heard of handbikes. They allow you to cover greater distances than manual wheelchairs. They are special tricycles where you use the hands for pedaling.\n\nFES, on the other side, is applied via adhesive electrodes or incorporated in bicycle shorts. The stimulus activates the muscles of the buttocks and thighs in sync with the ride. \u00a0However only the leg muscles can challenge the cardiovascular system to get physically fit. Some people with for example spinal cord injury (paraplegia) may be able to use FES for activating these large muscles. \u00a0With FES cycling they can cover greater distances with greater speed and due to activation of large muscles they get (bene-)fit and feel physical well-being. The research community has tried to promote a more widespread use of FES cycling by arranging races (see here) and publications with the user's statements of the pros and cons\u00a0(see here).\n\n\nbb.jpg1122x520 409 KB\n\n\nHow can we build research into practice or at least make options much more accessible?\n\nThe question is how to help people who have become paraplegic or their families know about the existence of such possibilities. FES bikes are quite expensive so where to go to try them? Many places and cycle lanes are missing so it requires some changes to infrastructure as well. But as long as nobody uses them it's a vicious circle. Therefore we need more awareness to reduce cost, change infrastructure and increase inclusion in the cycle community\n\nEven handbikes which are more popular can\u2019t be bought in a normal bicycle shop, but rather directly from a few specialized companies. The lack of marketing incurs high costs to manufacturers and hence to clients.\n\nMy own group\u2019s response as research and practitioners is to create a culture to promote this change, a project in the making. How can we promote actual experience based dialogue between users (who are maybe hackers) and researchers? There is an international community of researchers, so there should be a good chance of of finding local experts. As someone with a disability, you could connect with them and hack - evolve - test collaboratively cheap functional solutions in a healthcare hacking space. Dr Fitzwater, who is both a researcher and FES cycler, reports on the need to make benefits enjoyable in addition to positive medical outcomes: \u201cThe FESC function should be capable of being used on the open road with or without friends and family and be easily usable without any more assistance than that already required for the activities of daily living\u201d.\n\nWhy should you, me or anyone care about the future of research? you want to see your tax money spent well, don\u2019t you? And most importantly, this could be you or a relative who would like to go for a ride and have drastically limited options.

How do we create the conditions for\u00a0#opencare in our organisations and our communities? How do we design communities and organisations that are care-full, and promote health and flourishing? I'm curious about the interplay between policy and culture (as in ways of doing things rather than music and art). Are policies simply\u00a0agreements about what we think works and what is right at any given time? Moreover how are they implemented at government or\u00a0regional levels and in organisations, if they are to be more than good intentions? Do they end up needing enforced or policed by someone? Are they a tool of old ways of doing things built on hierarchy and power over? What role can they play in\u00a0creating the conditions for\u00a0opencare or for that matter for love and acceptance and generating\u00a0the sense of coherence that Antonovsky describes in salutogenesis\u00a0and its approach to study what creates health and well being rather than researching dis-ease?\n\nMy work through the GalGael Trust based in the Govan area of Glasgow has offered some hints that actively generating\u00a0a healthy\u00a0culture is perhaps more effective in achieving in an anchored way the 'good intentions' of policy. Strong values guide actions, decisions and\u00a0behaviour, influence language and how we treat one another. Our workshop sees people working, for the most, part side by side. We\u2019ve had people with violent histories, people who suffer agoraphobia, depression and addiction. Yet something about the space we\u2019ve created has meant that people largely get on, there\u2019ve been no violent incidents in our 20 year history and people describe their doctor taking them off medication, sometimes for the first time in many\u00a0years.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not a silver bullet. People lapse. They fall back in to the darkness at times. But there is something undeniable about the environment we\u2019ve created and actively generate that has a therapeutic affect. While some of our participants and volunteers have said \u2018the work is the therapy\u2019 - this refers to the hands on purpose they find in their labours not the work we do with them. So is this as a result of policy or culture? What is it that creates the conditions for an environment of open care? How do we understand the architectures of love that are called for to create a more care-full society?\n\nWe\u2019ve recently spent a year curating a collaborative process to explore what it means to \u2018be GalGael\u2019. It saw us going back to our beginnings and drawing on the learning from our days as an anti-motorway protest camp. We wrestled with our assumptions - which were shared and which were disputed?\u00a0We explored whether our purpose was actually underneath it all - to bring about greater love. This contributes to our being in a good place to\u00a0explore this theme more widely in our own organisation\u00a0and its practical application in more depth.\n\nThrough the process we would like to connect and learn from other organisations exploring this theme.\u00a0\n\nWhat kind of structures and processes are essential building blocks or make up the \u2019hardware\u2019?\n\nWhat kind internal capacities and approaches make up the \u2018software\u2019 that keep a healthy organisation, healthy community or healthy societies humming with human flourishing?\n\nThe theme could also link to other themes that explore how we create the conditions such as:\n\n\ncitizens income and the politics of time;\nnature of collaboration and how we exercise our freedoms and capacities;\nthe nature of work in care-full societies;\nforms of leadership and personal capacity called for.\u00a0\n\n\nI\u2019m very new to Edgeryders and I\u2019ve not had much time to develop this so would appreciate feedback and thoughts as to whether this might be a theme of interest to others.", "created_at": "2017-11-29 19:47:06.523593", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:43.788459", "tag_id": 1325, "post_id": 6304, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 6271}, {"id": 12974, "text": "", "quote": "many (not to say most of\u00a0the) players join consortia to submit proposals for EU funding, looking just for either cash, or for a way to complete \"deliverables\" with the minimum effort required.

This story serves as a first encounter with Edgeryders. It also includes written reflections by Vanessa.\n\nWeMHNurses hosts regular mental health themed twitter chats, as part of a network chat calendar, with wildly diverse topics ranging from \u201cThe use of digital technology in everyday practice\u201d to \u201cWorkplace democracy in mental health\u201d. The core team runs the day to day operations, on a purely voluntary basis, with the WeMHNurses account, also linking into the wider WeCommunities, which covers many different branches of Nursing and Health Care professions and specialism. Topics for chats tend to mostly emerge from topical conversations within the community or where there is, for example a national policy directive or key piece of published journalism relating to mental health. The community also run sponsored chats for national bodies such as the Dept of Health, Care Quality Commission and NHS England. The WeMHNurses team see their role as being about facilitating broader conversation in a democratised digital space, where everyone can have a voice, regardless of positional authority. The team also see their role as being to make national policy more accessible, in terms of the language being used. The community also has a particular focus on discussing the everyday implications of policy on mental health nursing practice.\n\nThe chats are generally facilitated by one of the @WeMHNurses team, with guests are often invited to participate in the chat where the person brings specific expertise to the conversation. This is an open process, whereby anyone can contact the team to suggest a chat topic or to ask to host a chat.The team provide support to individuals who want to host a chat from the @WeMHNurses Twitter handle.\n\nOur ethos is very much that \u201cyour opinion matters\u201d and we focus on the user point of view, getting people talking to each other and bringing a variety of perspectives to the conversation. We enjoy working with people who have previously been in services or are currently in services because we really value the lived experience perspective. As we are an independent voice, we will also cover topics that might be considered controversial, political or critical, as we believe that these conversations are important in setting the future direction for mental health nursing.\n\nOn reflection, we think that the liveliest and most informative chats are often where there is a real mixture of perspectives, including for example, clinicians, people accessing services, managers, leaders, academics, researchers and policy makers. The conversations that we have online are often very powerful for this reason as we can\u2019t think of many examples from our own professional lives, where there has been such a variety of voices in a room to debate a topic in such a level and democratic way. An example of this is a chat that Vanessa and Mark ran with the Health Service Journal, where we discussed the reduction of inpatient mental health beds across the country. This chat was very much brought to life by people sharing their experiences of how this impacted on them personally when they needed to access inpatient care.\n\nThe demographics for our chat suggest that we have a largely UK audience. However, because of the global reach of Twitter, we do have some international representation within our community and we love to encourage this because of the dimension that it brings to the conversation\n\nBefore we run a chat, we produce some pre chat information on the wecommunities website. This is generally written in a blog style, so it is broadly accessible reading. We are also looking at how we can make our chats even more inclusive, such as by providing audio for people who struggle to read or who have visual impairment. The challenge for us is that we are all volunteers, so we have to find ways of delivering information quickly.\n\nHow come this twitter format for talking about mental health? Is there something in the medium that helps learning, or alleviation for individuals?\n\nAs with everything there are always pros and cons. Some would say \u201cthere\u2019s only so many characters on twitter\u201d and mental health can be a very complex topic to discuss with limited characters, especially when people are talking about personal experience. On the other hand, it can help you be more focused and concise in what you are trying to say.\n\nI suppose using twitter to talk about mental health is quite personal, as is twitter use in general. There are many who find it hugely therapeutic and helpful, either getting involved in chats, communicating/ networking with others or for gaining support. It is a fab place for the sharing of information, including research and it's also a great forum for challenging stigma and moving the mental health agenda forward.\n\n\nWeMHNurses1_0.png900x480 120 KB\n\n\nWordcloud from\u00a0participants twitter bios in a recent chat -\u00a0source.\n\nIs there a cutoff number for participants in a chat? Or a number that makes it effective? I\u2019m wondering because you have such high regularity - every week.\n\nThere is not a maximum number of people in each chat, it can be anybody using the hashtag. Often people pop into the chat with just one or two tweets, whilst at the same time, we are having a conversation with other people, who participate in the entirety of the chat. When you are facilitating a chat, which is busy, it can be a challenge responding to every single tweet, but we do try to do this and often we find that people branch off and have separate conversations with other participants, within the chat, which goes down a different path to the structured questions of the main chat. Providing they still use the hashtag, we still capture this conversation in the transcript at the end. This is an example of the latest archived chat on a Tuesday evening, counting 133 contributors, 1200 tweets and with a reach of 7,561,098! This was a joint chat with @wenurses and @weldnurses.\n\nWith our over 6000 followers, plus the wider network, I suppose it is hard to say how many people we reach constantly. However, analytics for the chat are captured within the wecommunities website. Nick Chinn is the technical person behind this at Wecommunities.\n\nWhat do you think draws people in? What makes it a community for you? Is it people interacting with each other, learning, figuring out stuff?\n\nI suppose it is all of that. Everyone involved in the chats is interested in that particular area and that shared interest drives the discussions and questions in the chat, which will often support the development of links between people. Often people in the chats might say: \u2018this is a good chat\u2019, and \u2018why don\u2019t we do one on this other topic area?\u2019 It then keeps expanding, and there are more things that we get involved in. So, in essence, the community is about sharing knowledge and learning, being open to thinking in different ways and developing a support network as well.\n\nWhat for the future and how can we support your work?\n\nWe are\u00a0very aware that people establish relationships and friendships offline with people who they have connected with on Twitter and that these relationships are often a great source of strength and support for people.

This one is no exception.\n\nHowever this time I've been busy with something that could make a contribution that is interesting to your case ( @kate_g ) . I've been meaning to do it as a little story aswell but it really is only hobby format now - and I'd need someone with other background to apply it.\n\nTo keep it really brief I'll just lay out the bare bones, though in application it could be tweaked in very different directions (education, journalism, anthropology/ethnography).\n\nIn terms of concept think the opposite of broadcasting*, where one signal (on one schedule) goes out to everyone. Here I try to reach niches, perhaps indirectly, as much on their schedule & terms as possible, and I listen to them (ratio of listen/tell can be tweaked).\n\nIn terms of hardware I am currently sitting on 10 cheapo mp3 players and some mp3 voice recorders. The idea is to put some audio content on a small memory card (perhaps also some visual content e.g. on playing card size). This costs 2-3 $ and can hold days worth of structured audio content. The strucure of the content is important because I hope to turn the play+listener into a temporary agent (a little tolkeen's ring style). So you would have incentives there for the player (or several) to traverse the community networks in a mix of chance, human behavior, and programming, and hopefully end up in someones lap who may have been incredibly hard to find using other methods.\n\nYou can then get the recorder to this person (or have the person respond via a phone recording in a \"relatively 1st world context\") and document things in long form (8 GB - up to a week). Parts of this will be amiable for speech to text conversion. ( @brenoust that is why I asked the last time we talked)\n\nOnce you get the text corpus you can open it up the the digital domain ( @amelia can then probably mine this from an enthnograpic/anthropologic perspective) while it can remail fully anonymous. I also have a concept in mind for quantitative feedback which is similarly simple tech for users (colored beads on a string) but machine readable.\n\nThat way you get quant + qual abstractions but you can still jump to the original content fairly easily (provided you speak the language). It ought to scale quite well, especially if you can reuse some of the players.\n\nThe motivation for this came from a number of directions (OLPC griping, importance to capture emotion in human interaction, World Bank issues/capability building (two way!)) so I've played through a couple of different concepts that can perhaps be divided by organizational/technical aspects, content/didactic aspects, and info flow direction/volume.\n\nI'm currently working on putting together a prototype kit that could plausibly run for a couple of months (and with minor support perhaps years) as a replacement for a \"sit-in school\" in remote areas that have trouble with teacher absenteeism ( @nadia perhaps interesting to Olivier @ Co - also best of luck in Paris!) and people being too poor to abstain from manual labour for so long (and of course blind, illiterate, etc.). At the moment I'm checking the recharge curves to see how long the cheapo players will survive before someone needds to know how to fix/replace/work around the battery. If any of you see potential there I'd be happy to discuss it and set it up as a proper story.\n\n*that is why the working title is currently \"small casting\".

For example Nepal is not terribly far away from Pakistan where we know there is lots of drones loitering around. Many of them could have hopped over to Nepal with at max one stop-over for refueling in no time flat. I may have missed some (thanks for the link @alberto ), but so far I haven't seen many of the unambiguously beneficial uses exploited a whole lot. And some of them have been blindingly obvious in the last couple of weeks, and really not difficult to get at least working on.\n\nI don't want to belittle the fact that there are many small initiatives all over the place, and in most cases there is a LOT more work going on inside than meets the eye. One of the problems I have though is that if large sums of government money are to be spent on such a technology - that obviously has a significant and very complex societal impact - we don't seem to bother to discuss it in an effective manner. Such an attempt would include the people that make the tech, the people that operate it, and - very important - the ones affected by it. Before we produce all the facts. With drones we are looking at a very wide range of outcomes we could end up with, some of them very difficult or impossible reverse. Also we should be aware of a problem's roots, even when we feel compelled to fight the symptoms. We need to keep track of the externalities of a technology, and stay realistic.\n\nAt the moment all money pretty much goes exclusively to the usual suspects. How can civil society, at least parts of the \"global south\", or women's voices be heard and considered in such a process? When would this be done if not in the early stages of making the concepts? Are the current practices established in industry conducive to such a process (large mil ind complex organizations elbowing for money)? How is their track record of managing such programs, that need to stay flexible and permeable to tackle a field full of unknown unknowns (and un-unknow some knowns in the process) - to say it with the words of Rumsfeld and \u017di\u017eek, respectively.\n\nOf course it won't be simple and it won't be without friction, but if I weigh this against the societal cost of opportunity, and ER's chance to help connect and guide many center actors through a very dynamic edge - the problem has our name written all over it.

Of course, as mentionned by @matthias  in his post , Each of these spaces will have it is own identity, own business model and sustainability plan.

They are already in action. OpenVillage will support them to ensure the sustainability of their work (through reducing the operational costs when working in collaborative spaces, sharing with them expertise, experiences or fresh ideas etc.)\nDreamers (Local Community): who may be the aspired entrepreneurs, young people who seek to change their realities, join initiatives that would bring positive changes into their communities etc. This category, mainly the youth, are still learning, participating in workshops and trainings, discovering, experimenting, gaining experience and looking for opportunities, however they do not have their own venture.  this might be the largest population in the MENA region (We are talking about students who want to secure their future and jobless people who are looking to improve their realities). OpenVillage will support the \"Dreamers\" to become \"Doers\"\nSupporters (Partners and relevant stakeholders): As I have already explained, Supporters have the expertise and the resources.
