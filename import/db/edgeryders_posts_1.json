I\u2019d like to invite Edgeryders to engage with us in a conversation about being part of our consortium, with a particular focus on social innovation and citizen engagement (and, as we know, the governance innovations that come with those).*\n\nTo that invite, he attached the preliminary [concept note](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1h6s75E507lV59fZ-rRqq_1D52DaQef8u). \n\nA couple of calls happened since then: \n   \nOne in which Nadia participated with the Climate KIC and invited partners (on Thursday 1/10) - from which it was evident that the concept is still not well defined; \n\nAnother one between Alberto, Thomas and myself (on Monday 19/10) in which he explained the Climate KIC will be the coordinator and the [LGI consultancy](http://lgi-consulting.com/) will be doing the writing. We explained we could intervene in various ways based on the direction the consortium takes, we tailor our contribution. We agreed they will share a more detailed concept note and then we'll schedule another call. \n\nFrom both of these conversations we couldn't grasp what exactly is behind this, so we convened a separate call with Anthony Zacharzewski - whom Nadia and Alberto know from before and whose organization [Demsoc](https://www.demsoc.org/) is also part of the consortium in the making. His colleague Nadja was also present. This call happened today and here are some notes: \n\n### What we learned\n\n- Demsoc has been involved in the [Healthy and Clean Cities Deep Demonstrations](https://www.demsoc.org/projects/healthy-clean-cities-deep-demonstrations), also in collab with Climate KIC. The process was not structured and the roles of design partners were unclear. \n- Still, this collaborative approach in the cities works so DG RTD was convinced that the approach is right and now wants to scale it up. Therefore this call.  \n- Only one bid will be successful (54 million is the total contribution, 60% used as cascading funding).\n- they are planning to involve around 30 cities, each of them would get 1 million. 3-4 million would go for citizens engagement (very rough estimation, at this point it's still difficult to say).\n- the hard lobbying was done by the people who are at the core of the EUROCITIES and on the cities mission board. One of them is Annalisa Boni, *didn't catch the other name.*\n- this is linked to cities working towards 2030 decarbonization\n- high stakes proposal, led by senior people.\n- Boni and Kirsten (Climate KIC) making the decisions.\n- Jolanda and Vincent (LGI) doing the writing.\n- Thomas Osboda, the person in C-KIC who wrote to us, was very involved in the early stages, but now things are happening above his pay grade. Yet, he may be the person who wanted Edgeryders in.\n- The challenge: different cities have different world views (not only different needs). This is a bad fit for \"scaling up\". The word \"platform\" in Healthy and Clean Cities was used to mean not a digital artifact, but a web of relationships across the various actors. In this iteration, they may want to be a bit more standardized and centralized for scale. \n\n### What we agreed to do \n\n1. Absolutely get on board. They will have hired a professional writer. Our actual writing effort will be minimal. \n2. In this case, our job is to be \"good soldiers\": we need to figure out exactly what problem the presence of EDGE is supposed to solve, and then construct an argument for it. That argument goes in the proposal. The main author needs to be able to claim that that we have that problem 10% covered.\n3. We ally with DemSoc to argue for a substantial investment of the proposal in citizen engagement. Public value and public participation should be at the core. We could offer distributed sensemaking and collaborate with Demsoc on this.\n4.  We should use the fact that the online element is now interesting + Covid preparedness.\n5. Next step: a frank call with Jolanda and Demsoc. Find out what their problem is, agree to help but make sure they take that seriously. It means: requesting the right budget and contributing to writing for the relevant parts.", "created_at": "2020-10-22 13:57:40.048546", "updated_at": "2020-10-22 22:05:35.078222", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 810, "wiki": true, "reads": 9, "score": 61.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74193, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13116, "post_number": 14, "raw": "can you upload it here?", "created_at": "2020-04-12 04:47:44.281606", "updated_at": "2020-04-12 04:47:44.281606", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [74188], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83775, "user_id": 6455, "topic_id": 14463, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![aziz-acharki-PUvPZckRnOg-unsplash|690x466](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498019559366-a1cbd07b5160?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=60) \n---\n\n## Dear friends and family,\n\nIt\u2019s becoming more evident as the days of 2020 trickle by that the world that existed prior to the pandemic, has drastically changed. Not only do our daily lives look different, but parallel to this, the climate change emergency seems more stark than ever. Images emerging of Californian wildfires show what the future may hold.\n\nAt Edgeryders, we have been asking how we can better prepare ourselves for the coming years. We have been analysing new ways local economies may help us as we transition to a green economy.\n\nWe held a webinar, recently, that looked at the local economy of the Messina district in Sicily. It is a really good example of not only how a social enterprise can gain trust among people that have severely distrusted civic institutions, because of a history of organised crime, but also how green energy subsidies could be used in a way that benefited a local community by reducing fossil fuels, reintegrating serious mental health patients into society, spawning several new businesses and providing further funding for the organisation.\n\nIf you would like to read more about how Fondazione Communit\u00e0 di Messina achieved this, you can [read more here and join in our conversation](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14505).\n\nCoworking has been a major theme for us and the impact the virus has had on the sector. Since running our coworking events during the summer months, we have been asking [what\u2019s the next step for the sector](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14316)?\n\nAs many countries are now facing their second wave of cases, this may be an even more urgent question. Many of us are balancing family needs and work life while daycare and schools are closed.  In the long term this is unsustainable and will likely lead to burnout. But maybe that's where coworking can come to the rescue. Some spaces are innovating in the sector to offer childcare options to parents that are working remotely. If you have any thoughts on this or would like to join that conversation, please comment [here](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14331). \n\nThere are other ways that the sector could help others throughout the crisis too. One of our founding members Noemi has asked if there is a way that co-working spaces are helping freelancers during this period? If your government is supporting work-from-home programmes or has a policy in place, please join the conversation [here](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14504).\n\nIf you\u2019re new to the co-working game, then take a look at some of the tips and advice our members who have been working from the home office for years have [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/remote-work-for-everyone-what-we-stand-to-gain/14192).\n<br>\n**Don\u2019t forget...**\n\n\nOur conversations aren\u2019t only happening on the platform, some upcoming events:\n\n* **8/10:**  [ **Citizen engagement and regional policies** ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/our-session-on-citizen-engagement-in-euregionsweek-sneak-peek/14489) in the transition to a viable low carbon economy.\n* **16/10** : [ **Info session about our new World Building academy!** ](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14481) We are launching a residency in collaboration with EIT Climate Kic as part of our Scifi Economics Lab.\n* **29/10:**  [ **How can we work together to support localisation of food?** ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/draft-event-invitation-sustainable-agriculture-and-food/14493) A webinar to learn about opportunities in the EU and beyond.

On Tuesday, the German government introduced the [Corona Warn App](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/corona-warn-app), designed to identify and quickly \u201cbreak chains of infection\u201d (Lothar Wieler of the Robert Koch Institute). The App, which is being marketed as a voluntary download, alerts users when and for how long they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus. \n\n\nIn a recent EdgeRyder Community Call, we talked to experts across Europe about the risks that contact tracing Apps pose for data security. Many agreed that these Apps and similar technologies force an unnecessary trade-off in which civil liberties may be sacrificed in the interest of fighting the virus. Experts warned of three major risks: a) we don\u2019t have a clear privacy-friendly solution for the development of these technologies and it is therefore unclear where the data will be sourced from (and by whom) and how it will be regulated, b) there is an unequal distribution of risk as this may lead to the disproportionate targeting of vulnerable communities, and c) there is an absence of the counterfactual, meaning we don\u2019t yet know enough about the effectiveness of allowing \u2018normal life\u2019 to resume and it is therefore risky to develop strategies without clear, counterfactual knowledge to work with. More on our discussions [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-results-of-the-community-listening-post-on-risks-for-freedom-in-the-wake-of-covid-19/13183), [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ethnography-team-reflection-on-a-surveillance-pandemic/13248/4) and [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-reflection-of-the-methods-of-the-community-listening-post-9th-april-2020/13207).\n\n \nIn light of these discussions, I was curious to learn more about Germany\u2019s App. I am from and currently live in Berlin, where many restrictions have already been lifted and where the summer months have brought more and more people out to public parks, restaurants and bars. \n\n\n**How can Germany feasibly guarantee users\u2019 data privacy, hem further surveillance and effectively contain the spread of the virus?** \n\n \nThe App \u2013 developed by the German government in collaboration with Apple, Google (using their \u201cprivacy-focused\u201d technology) and Deutsche Telekom AG (Germany\u2019s largest telecommunication company) \u2013 has received quite a lot of praise for its seemingly data-friendly solution (even Chaos Computer Club (CCC) has not issued any critiques thus far):\n\n \n\nUsers have been assured that their data privacy will not be compromised and that contact data will not be saved centrally (though this was the original plan), but will instead be stored on the smartphones themselves. According to its developers, the App also does not log users\u2019 location, but uses Bluetooth to allow users to share information. Users are also guaranteed anonymity while using the app, whereby each device is allocated an identification number, which is then visible to all other app users when in the same vicinity. During a span of two weeks, all user IDs are stored in your app, and, if one of those users tests positive during that two week span, your App alerts you. After two weeks, the data is erased. \n\n \nIt seems that the effectiveness of this App is largely based upon the people using it. According to virologists at the [University of Oxford](https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/Article/2020-04-16-digital-contact-tracing-can-slow-or-even-stop-coronavirus-transmission-and-ease-us-out-of-lockdown), such Apps are only effective if around 60% of the population uses them. In the German case, the effectiveness of the App also depends on users uploading their test results to the app: if a person tests positive for the virus, they receive a unique QR code which they then have to scan into their smartphone/the App. Only then can other users, who have been in contact with that person, be notified. Users are notified anonymously, meaning they don\u2019t find out who the infected individual is, but they are informed about their personal risk level of infection and are urged to seek testing.  \n\n \n\nThe App \u2013 which cost 20m Euro to develop and will require 3m Euro a month to operate \u2013 has an open source program code, meaning it can theoretically be copied and updated by other countries. The German government hopes that other European countries will follow suit and that a system will quickly be built that works across Europe.  \n\n  \n\nWithin the first day of its launch, the App was downloaded close to 1m times, however many remain sceptical about what this means for their data privacy and how these technologies might feed in to further surveillance. According to a recent poll, around 42% of those surveyed, feel comfortable using the App, as opposed to 39% who said they wouldn\u2019t and 19% who either did not own a smart phone or felt they needed more information. \n\n \n\nI talked to a handful of family members and friends about their views of the App (most around the age of 30). Their reactions split across two main groups: Most (group 1) felt that they did not have enough information about the App, its aims and functions and its implications for data security, and are sceptical of downloading it. Many said, they will \u2018wait and see\u2019 how useful and secure the App is before they consider downloading it. The second, much smaller group was optimistic about the App; several had already downloaded it, others were strongly considering it. Many in this group cited their trust in the government and that, since the data is not stored centrally, they felt comfortable using it. This group also believes the App is the best way to contain the spread of the virus.  \n\n \n\nThis is just a cursory glance at the recent developments in Germany\u2019s contact-tracing App technology, but I am curious to hear from the rest of the EdgeRyders community.

However, the Centre for Political Beauty works completely against the system, or parrallel to it at best.\n\nWoodbine as well, from past conversations, seem to be\u00a0on the revolutionary side - although someone in the collective mentioned working in public hospitals and guiding people through the system, fully aware that at the end of the day the system is failing us all.\u00a0<a href=\"/t/woodbine-health-autonomy-center/488/2\">This past discussion</a> on the Woodbine sustainability and interaction with the system is truly\u00a0enlightening: \"agree that we have to study the idea of both being within the system and out\". What came out was the question of whether teaching prevention, taking on a single point of system failure could be lower hanging fruit for groups like yours who make a real contribution but also risk overburdening or taking on too big a task. Meeting basic survival needs like housing or food, which are traditionally system tasks is more difficult and involve a certain work\u00a0with the system in order to build that\u00a0major capacity - i.e. charities or grant funded organisations.\u00a0 @maymay can confirm if this is a good summary.\n\nOver these 20 years GalGael is surely becoming a repository\u00a0of learnings and things which work, or dont.

Once the project was approved, she invited me to join in. We also have a lot of things in common \u2013 arts and so on \u2013 which helps us to work together: I also work on Romanian topics, which is also why we met with Maria, and there are two or three core lines of my interest; contemporary history and the transition between systems, combining political and historical studies; identity studies in Transylvania, which I am researching, and I want to understand how it is used in the political context; Jewish history in central and South-East Europe, the Holocaust and post-Holocaust. I teach courses on regions and minorities in central and Eastern Europe; contemporary Balkan affairs; Jewish history.\n\nI am on the platform because I have experience with coding, we use a lot of digital approaches in research at the Malach Centre, and work with living people as source providers \u2013 I am interested in the whole ecosystem of data, the people who generate, collect and analyse them, to make better sense out of it. I am interested in the permeation of political topics into artistic and cultural expressions. \n\n_What do you struggle with?_\n\nI am in the 7th year of my PhD and I am trying to finish my dissertation. For a period of time, I lost control of my work management because of all the projects I take part in. I used to be stressed about my efficiency and that I am not writing my thesis, but it was counterproductive, I am quite pragmatic now. I actually struggle with doing things for myself \u2013 I would rather work on something for other people. I actually procrastinate my own work with the work I do with and for others. \n\n_What interests you?_\n\nI am very much interested in music and I\u2019ve been doing music my whole life, still being an active musician at the moment. I can feel that political division emerges in the sphere of underground music as well.. however, I still haven\u2019t stabilized my position \u2013 on one hand, I am an observer, on the other hand, I am personally involved. Mine/our understanding of rebellion is different, stemming from the anti-totalitarian tradition constituted during the communist period, rather than the emerging \"populist\" one. \n\nDo you also feel the POPREBEL-lion challenging values and norms in your everyday life, the fields of your hobbies and interests?", "created_at": "2019-01-18 10:27:34.946411", "updated_at": "2019-03-04 09:36:52.318661", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 443, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 78.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3904, 4, 8, 5211], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79690, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13989, "post_number": 9, "raw": "I can't get all those interviews edited in 2 days.

P\u0142aci\u0142am za prywatn\u0105 wizyt\u0119 u chirurga\ndzieci\u0119cego, bo w szpitalu niby sprawdzano stan zdrowia dziecka, ale jako\u015b nie sprawdzono \u017ce przez fizjologiczn\u0105 wad\u0119 w obr\u0119bie buzi nie mo\u017ce ssa\u0107 prawid\u0142owo i wymagany jest drobny zabieg chirurgiczny.

Punkty w rekrutacji przyznawane s\u0105 za to, \u017ce nad rodzin\u0105 czuwa kurator s\u0105dowy, MOPS, za to \u017ce rodzina jest niepe\u0142na, z problemami \n inansowymi, za rodze\u0144stwo. Za to, \u017ce obydwoje rodzic\u00f3w pracuje i p\u0142aci podatki w swoim miejscu zamieszkania i jako\u015b sobie radzi, punkt\u00f3w jest tyle co kot nap\u0142aka\u0142.

Ulgi na dziecko z podatku nie odpiszemy, bo zarabiamy za du\u017co. Na dop\u0142at\u0119 do \u017c\u0142obka si\u0119 nie za\u0142apujemy z tego samego powodu. Paradoksem jest, \u017ce jak zap\u0142acimy za \u017c\u0142obek rywatny, b\u0119dziemy pewnie w gorszej sytuacji finansowej ni\u017c niejeden rodzic, kt\u00f3ry zarabia od nas niej, ale nie musi co miesi\u0105c wyda\u0107 znacznej cz\u0119\u015bci swojego wynagrodzenia na prywatny \u017c\u0142obek. No ale sami sobie jeste\u015bmy winni, przecie\u017c sobie jako\u015b radzimy.\n\nMoim marzeniem jest pa\u0144stwo, kt\u00f3re dba o to, \u017ceby rodzice po urlopie rodzicielskim mogli wr\u00f3ci\u0107 do swojej pracy, bo ich firma si\u0119 rozwija dzi\u0119ki stabilnej sytuacji gospodarczej.

The high school I went to was founded and organized by a Cistercian monastery. So it was a major common project, and many of the monks were teachers there. However, they also had some \"free time\" for personal side projects. The abbott for example liked renewable energy, and\u00a0 operated a turbine and heat pump in the creek flowing around the monastery, covering a part of its energy needs and in turn being funded by the monastery's money ...\n\nGeneralizing this brings up the question if it would be a good organization style if everybody just works on his / her pet project or if there rather would be (also) some \"official\" projects that the un-monastery group agrees upon.\n\nHaving common projects in an edgy, tech-savvy community also enables some very special style of powerful, colocated, efficient collaboration. The experience of which can let one forget easily that one is maybe not working on ones perfect choice of project. Had this experience for some weeks (in total) when working together with tens and later hundreds of people to transform an abandoned army area for a larger music festival. The sense of solidarity and mutual help was really unique; I did computer and network services there, and whenever I needed handicrafts people to change / fix something, it was done in minutes. Add to this some special smartphone app for agile collaboration, and the un-monastery could become a totally unique place. (Personally, I have always been fascinated by powerful intentional communities, and have done organizational design and collaboration software design for these <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/ma-documents/main/CommunityGroupware.Thesis.pdf\">in my diploma thesis</a>.)\n\nAnd doing the dishes would be within the tasks of any self-respecting un-monastery.

This prompted us to look at regional cohesion policy through an Edgeryders lens.  By this, I mean an approach that emphasizes the creativity and idealism of smart communities at the edge of society. It turns out that, if you see the world as we do, a clear approach to regional policy presents itself. And yes, it does start with citizen engagement.\n\nEngaging citizens is a powerful way to tap into collective  intelligence. That intelligence only gets it more far-sighted when  you power it it with data. Further in the post, I\u2019ll give you some examples from  our own work. But before I do that, let me point out that a data approach, in our  experience, does not solve the fundamental problem of citizen engagement as we know it. Which is this: **it is fundamentally unfair**. Let me explain.  \n\nWhen you engage as a citizen, you are putting it time and effort to  help a professional decision maker (a politician or a civil servant) to  do her job. You forego hanging out with your friends and family, or  taking a walk in the park, or whatever you like doing. What do you get  in return?  \n\nWell, you get a say. Your voice is heard. In resonance with others, your contribution might help change a public decision, and that will  result in a world that you like better. In one word, you get **power**.  \n\nSo, why is it so hard to get people to participate? Are people  apathetic? Hardly. From the Gilets Jaunes, to Extinction Rebellion,  to Le Sardine, Europe is full of committed, enthusiastic people, fighting for the world they want. In our experience, the main obstacle to participation is that most citizen engagement opportunities consist in **going through the motions, while no real transfer of power takes place**. Take copyright: we have seen many participatory exercises, some quite successful in number and quality of  contributions. Time and again, the great majority of those contributions request more freedom to share. Time and again, lawmakers decide against these concerns, and [in favor of the lobbies of the copyright holders](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/eus-copyright-proposal-extremely-bad-news-everyone-even-especially-wikipedia).  \n\nThis is, of course, part of the democratic game. But there's a problem here. Ritualistic participatory processes not only are time and  energy sinks. **They transform our time and intelligence into a  justification for rubberstamping decisions that were never meant to be  questioned**. Copyright lobbies can rightly claim that the process leading to their political victories was participatory. This destroys social capital, because people conclude \u201cfool me twice,  shame on me\u201d and disengage. Many conclude it makes more sense to take part into more aggressive forms of  participation, like street protests.  \n\nFailure to transfer real power to the citizenry is a general problem  with citizen engagement. Engagement in regional cohesion policies also has a specific problem. This: **regional cohesion tends to view development as a singular path,** rather than a plurality of paths. For cohesion policies, full success  is defined as every NUTS2 region in Europe looking like, say, \u00cele de  France or North Holland. The corollary of that is that, say West  Pomerania or Thessaly are basically low-grade versions of \u00cele de France. Their success is measured against a model that evolved elsewhere. A model that many regions have given up believing they can deploy with  comparable success. This narrative is demoralizing, and it makes it  harder to get people to engage. This creates a political space to capitalize on this frustration, by offering a cultural pushback (\u201cthe ways of our ancestors\u201d vs. \u201cBrussels  technocracy\u201d). \n\nSo, what to do? At Edgeryders, we have been practicing engagement as **action, more than consultation**. For example, over the winter we worked with the World Bank to set up a  sort of peer-to-peer business incubator for young would-be entrepreneurs  in the MENA region. Most of it happens in an [online forum](https://edgeryders.eu/c/openvillage/ocilab). The  conversation therein unearthed a lot of rich information about what it  means to start a business for a young person in that part of the world.  But people are not there to share their views. They are there to  help each other start their respective businesses, a much stronger  incentive, and the rich knowledge is a byproduct of their interaction. Even if the policies don\u2019t change, participants are still happy with the programme, because they are building their own businesses.  \n\nAnother example: we ran the participatory part of the Italian city of Matera\u2019s  bid to win the title of European capital of culture 2019. The title  was, of course, an excuse to reinvent the region\u2019s economy, as its  traditional industrial backbone (upholstery) was being relocated to  China. Our strategy consisted in finding out what kind of initiatives  people were doing (around culture, the environment, public spaces, urban  games, computer literacy for children\u2026), and encouraging them to roll  out \u201cinstant\u201d initiatives to support the city\u2019s bid. The rallying cry was \u201cshow Europe that we can be different here, that the South is not condemned to lagging behind\u201d.  \n\nFirst, we convened a large-scale, open online conversation to find  out what was happening on the ground. Next, we used a [methodology](https://zenodo.org/record/1059029) combining ethnography and graph theory to represent that conversation, encoded as data, and analyzed it to extract a sort of map of key  concepts and seminal projects. Finally, we suggested people could use their skills and networks to roll out \u201ccommunity projects\u201d in support of  the bid. We rolled out some minimal services to help them with rapid  deployment. \n\nAn explosion of activity ensued. Someone made an [open source  solar tracker](https://tech.mirelsol.org/doku.php/projects:open_source_solar_tracker:start) \u201cto make the cultural programme greener\u201d. Someone else  improvised a super-participatory performance in which the city\u2019s street  lighting was turned off, and citizens were encouraged to [take to the streets with candles](https://youtu.be/RXSjEEbChGs). Others set up [the largest Coderdojo ever made](https://youtu.be/mxd9SlmWrqM),  with over 1,000 children coding simple games. There was even a group  who walked several hundred kilometers across the region, picking up new  walkers as they walked, to [tell the ECOC judges that the entire region stood behind the bid](https://youtu.be/q98tFM_zHmY).  \n\nThe system was compounded by a barebones scheme of \u201csocial innovators in residence\u201d, the [unMonastery](https://youtu.be/ABPNRbeQtd4), inspired by sixth-century Western monasticism. Residents were coming  from everywhere in Europe, connecting the local scene to its  counterparts elsewhere. The city went on to win the title, and the  participatory nature of the bid was an important factor in this victory.  Yet, the story does not end with \u201chappily ever after\u201d. Almost immediately after the proclamation, local politics took over, as it  tends to do in these competitions. Many of the people and groups that  had led the bid were frozen out of the delivery of the bid, as local politicians and institutions fought for control of the money. Those  \u201cinnovators\u201d, who rightly saw the the winning bid as their own work, saw this as betrayal, and **reacted with negativity and disenchantment.**  \n\nOur conclusion is this. Data are important for  citizen engagement. Giving people data helps them see further. A data  approach to collective intelligence helps to tap it in a more  consistent, solid way. But in the end, collective intelligence, not just \"data\", is the  magic dust that can propel regional cohesion. And if you want collective intelligence to engage, you need to enable people to act, not just talk. And you need to turn over to them real power, including that  of coming up with their own standard for what it means to be  \u201cdeveloped\u201d. In a way, we have citizen engagement exactly backwards. **It is not the citizens that should engage in regional policies. It is regional policies that should engage with what citizens are already doing**, and provide support, legitimacy, legal frameworks. To do this, policy makers need to reach out to them, get to know them, encourage bold experiments at a comparatively large scale (NUTS 3, or even NUTS 2), and move in to scale whatever works. Maybe get North Holland, for once, to imitate Thessaly and not vice versa.\n\nThe good news is that **the standards of \u201cdeveloped\u201d need major  overhaul anyway**. The climate emergency is forcing our hand. Our economic model needs to change. Our economic science needs to change. Our indicators of  economic health, like GDP growth, are no longer fit for purpose. We are  seeing a deep societal longing for some kind of post-capitalist  configuration. We are seeing a lot of experimentation, from eco-villages  to local currencies, to commons-based peer production, to new  cooperativism. In 2019 we created a unit of maverick economists and entrepreneurs, the [Sci-Fi Economics Lab](https://scifieconomics.net), to systematize and scale these  experiences.  \n\nSo, we have a major opportunity here: **encourage Europe\u2019s regions to experiment with different economic models**. Maybe West Pomerania wants to  be like Bhutan, focusing on \u201cgross national happiness\u201d, rather than like North Holland. Maybe Thessaly would like to try out regional-scale commons-based peer production. Let them do it, let a hundred flowers  bloom! This is good for Europe\u2019s long-term resilience, because it  broadens our porfolio of economic models. And it is _very_ good for citizen engagement. Even for our souls, and the deep meaning of our adventure on planet Earth. Because, hey: it is more fun to be Europe's R&D lab on future societal and economic model than to be the laggard student at the back end of the classroom.", "created_at": "2020-02-04 10:45:32.663545", "updated_at": "2020-02-05 21:18:08.885907", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1656, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 1484.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5268, 2915, 4022, 4683], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53165, "user_id": 5079, "topic_id": 9857, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![61393428_2216143561839710_1925775967301664768_n|492x690](upload://8akaHY0e2JNogHcp88mwCXH61Dz.jpeg) \n\nMoi rodzice (jak wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 rodzic\u00f3w na \u015bwiecie) nie czuli si\u0119 przygotowani do tego, aby rozmawia\u0107 ze swoim dzieckiem o seksualno\u015bci.

AMA!\n\nIn 2014, the Dutch government introduced a legislation approving the use of a risk scoring algorithm to detect welfare fraud. This system, called System Risk Indication (SyRI), pools together data from various government agencies to calculate the likelihood of committing welfare or tax fraud. The UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights has described governments\u2019 use of similar systems as \u201c[digital welfare states](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Poverty/A_74_48037_AdvanceUneditedVersion.docx)\u201d and condemned them for their lack of transparency and oversight, and discriminatory impacts. In the case of SyRI, we discovered that the system used neighbourhood data to profile against migrant and poor communities.\n\nWith a coalition of privacy organisations, we challenged SyRI on grounds of privacy and equality violations. Earlier this year, the Dutch court found SyRI to be unlawful and ordered its immediate halt. You can read more [here](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/story/syri-netherlands-algorithm/) and [here](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBDHA:2020:1878).\n\nThis case sets a strong legal precedents for future cases. Unfortunately, the Dutch government recently introduced a new legislation with even more intrusive use of personal data for automated decision-making system\u2013the fight continues!\n\nSee you all on Wednesday, in the meantime, feel free to **Ask @nextgenethno Anything** if you have any questions!", "created_at": "2020-11-06 12:11:40.376712", "updated_at": "2020-11-08 13:31:33.973676", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 573, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 53.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4096, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37264, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7240, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/90230793326b066bb08a95a67af6efa9798c480d.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"447\">\n\n*Click to enlarge*\n\nIn July we migrated the Edgeryders community onto a new, more modern and more usable platform (you are looking at it now). In the aftermath of this move, all API access to the platform had changed. Some of our monitoring tools had to be reconfigured. As a result, we were unable to check on the OpenCare conversation metrics for over two months. \n\nWhen I could get [my scripts](https://github.com/opencarecc/rapid-social-networks) to work again, surprise: the conversation had grown considerably. As I write this, it has at **394 unique participants**, who authored **4,358 posts in 697 topics**. We have cleared the mark of **one million words** in the conversation. \n\nWhere does all this extra content come from? From four main outlets:\n\n1. The main Opencare conversation continued to grow.\n2. The upcoming Open Village Festival is generating great energy, so [lots of interesting content](https://edgeryders.eu/c/festival). \n3. We had a stroke of luck: a [separate project](https://edgeryders.eu/c/openvillage) uncovered lots of interesting projects and experiences from the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries. Some of them are about care, so we included them in the OpenCare material.\n4. As part of the transition onto the new platform, we reclassified all the backlog of Edgeryders content. During this, we unearthed some content that is relevant to OpenCare, and included that too. \n\nThe different origins of all this content shows in the slightly more modular structure of the resulting network: it looks less like a hairball, and you can see groups of participants clustering around single nodes like @ezio_manzini (southwest), @matteo (northeast)  and @hexayurt  (northwest). Despite this, the conversation still induces a highly cohesive social network \u2013 I guess it is a testament to the cohesiveness of Edgeryders in general. The network has 1,405 unique edges, and is completely connected into a single giant component that connects 100% of the nodes. A small number of moderators and community managers engages absolutely everyone, but even removing them from the network leaves well over 80% of the nodes connected to the giant component (this is the network shown in the picture above).

This workshop was part of an ongoing conversation on our community platform [( overview here)](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ai-inequalities-and-justice-an-overview-of-all-documented-discussions-before-during-and-after-the-workshop/12014/3).\n\nIts purpose is to make sense of what we can do to take agency over the development of our futures in the age of what is often framed as inevitable developments towards one of two outcomes: The undoing of humanity vs a path to save us from ourselves. \n\nWhat have I understood so far? It all boils down to the following:\n\n##  We need new general principles of justice as a foundation for all policymaking in an age of networked technologies.\n\n\n1) The ethics of substantial freedom. This includes citizens\u2019 inalienable rights of ownership, control, access and possession of information about themselves and their communities.\n\n2) The Capability Approach as defined by Amartya Sen. \n\n3) Data is not a commodity. In the digital society it is the equivalent of the air we breathe.\n\n4) Optimisation is not neutral. The choice to optimise at all has to be assessed based on its potential impact on the substantial freedoms of the individual.\n\n5) \u201cThe individual\u201d, \u201cthe citizen\u201d and the \u201cHuman\u201d are understood to mean individual members of the species Homo Sapiens.\n\n## If we wish to ensure rule of law in Europe, we need a principle of balance of investment when it comes to AI and other networked digital technologies. \n\nThis means that for every investment of public resources into promotion, education, research, development, or monetisation of these new technologies - we need to ensure equal injection of  resources towards providing the means for the individual citizen to gain ownership, control, access and possession of information about themselves and their communities. \n\nThese resources have to be directly accessible and accountable to the individual citizen and their community.\n\n## A moonshot mission: \n\n If we want to ensure that AI/New Internet Technologies serves european citizens and businesses Europe must invest in building, maintaining and developing public cloud infrastructure.\n\n## This is a first draft and open to suggestions.

This was before Yahoo, Google, Amazon or any of the big web content providers. Everything was experimental.\n\nBack then, nobody was going to pay for any content. The reasons were not that different than they are now in the sense that connectivity got direct payment.  Back then it not only cost money to connect, but it was kind of a hassle for the average user to even get onto the WWW. \n Everything was still modems outside of big net-connected institutions and businesses and while that was a big part of the early web traffic, those users were not going to get their universities or companies to pay. A lot of the time was spent in off hours when the boss wasn't looking.  And if you used a modem things could get pretty slow.  We often called WWW the \"world wide wait.\"\n\nAnd print was still king back then, despite the large presence of proprietary services like AOL.  So one could not realistically ask for money directly for content.  And, there was no realistic way to collect the money unless you had an admin infrastructure set up to deal with it, which back then involved someone calling a new subscriber to make sure they had a valid credit card.\n\nSo, we started by giving away selected news and sports stories to build traffic in the hope that sometime in the future we could charge for it.  I think it was Wired! and their early pioneering service Hotwired! that ran the first banner ads.  This was the start of the process we have today.  And because I was working for a newspaper that had an ad sales department, we too sold some banner ads.\n\nThen Yahoo! began. This was the first game-changer.  They had so much traffic that they could sell ads in bulk for very low per-impression prices.  This forced everyone else to get more \"creative\" if they wanted to sell an ad.\n\nAt the risk of going on too long in this post, let me pause to explain a reality about selling advertisements.  You have a media product for which you want to sell ads. You go to an advertiser and make your pitch. They seem interested, but often they will say something like, \"looks good but can we do something a little different, a little more special?\"  So you, the salesperson, thinks, \"if I say no we can't do that then I am going to walk out of here with nothing.  If I say sure we can do something special, then I will put a burden on my tech people, but I will get the sale.\"  Good salespeople always take the money.  So what special things can you do?\n\nAt first, we manually put certain ads next to related content, but Yahoo, and in a few years Google, were getting the big-volume search traffic, far beyond anything we could do.  We could automate it to a degree, but again, the volume just wasn't there.  In our case, we bundled the online ads with the print and TV stuff (my company also owned a TV station and we ran TV content too).  That was the extent of our sophistication, and this is generally true of the industry itself back then.  Match ads with content in whatever meaningful way you could figure out.  That was the pervasive model.  Same with Google.\n\nThen in 2000/2001 came the dot-com bust period and the now-huge search companies had gone public and saw their stock price dropping.  they had to do something or they were going to go bankrupt by losing their investors.  Google realized that they were sitting on huge amounts of personal information that they could use for better ad targeting.  And they had enough money to hire the best programmers.  And so began the age of \"surveillance capitalism\" which is where we are today.\n\nMeanwhile, during this time, the big phone companies, that had been surprisingly clueless about the data gold mine they were sitting on, started to catch on and made it easier for the public to \"jack in.\"  In the process, the speed and convenience increased and they were able to begin raising their prices, locking in for themselves the direct-pay component of this new world.\n\nAnd, given Metcalf's Law, that says the network grows more powerful as each node connects to it, the Net's winner-take-all model pushed everything toward the reality we have today.  \n\nMaybe it was all like a stream that started small and you could navigate your little boat, and then as it grew the current got to where you could only try to stay within the momentum of the flow...until, what - we all go over the waterfall?", "created_at": "2019-04-30 14:24:50.698324", "updated_at": "2019-04-30 14:27:45.695787", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 850, "wiki": false, "reads": 35, "score": 57.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [52971], "is_liked_by": [1856, 5083], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49683, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 9061, "post_number": 71, "raw": "@Alberto and @markomanka , @melancon and I are on zoom. are you joining us?", "created_at": "2018-12-27 13:39:56.892275", "updated_at": "2018-12-27 13:39:56.892275", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [49682], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49759, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9061, "post_number": 100, "raw": "Actually, it's not exactly the same.

What I'm writing is based on developing the [Trustable Technology Mark](https://trustabletech.org), a trustmark for connected consumer products, issued by our non-profit, [ThingsCon](https://thingscon.org). So that's the area I looked at most closely, but I think a lot might apply beyond IoT.\n\nSo, there are various categories of \"trust marks\", some more explicit than others, like: Certifications, which often certify compliance with a law or regulation, like the CE mark, or the more general \"consumer marks\" or \"trust marks\", which depending on the jurisdiction are less \"hard\" so to speak. Either one of them needs an issuing body, meaning for larger scale projects we're talking about large organizations.\n\n(ThingsCon's Trustable Technology Mark is both very young and a very small project, and technically speaking not a certification but a mark we license companies to use if they meet certain criteria for transparency and other aspects. Details matter in these things.)\n\nThat said, after having studied this for quite some time but without a longer-term background in this space I think it's fair to say that just about any assumption you'd make (\"it just needs to do X by Y in oder to demonstrate Z\") is quite likely not going to stand up to a somewhat rigorous kicking of the proverbial tires. For things that are as vague/debatable as \"ethical\" or \"fair\" or even the much easier (but still freakishly hard to define) \"private\", even a baseline definition is incredibly hard, because we're talking about nearly philosophical debates plus _a lot_ of contextual interpretations.\n\nThat said, I'm not here to grump around and I would like to see more of this in the world. So practically speaking, what are the challenges and opportunities?\n\nChallenges:\n\n* Trust in the issuing org: Who is the trusted authority of issuing this trust mark? \n* Legal status: Is this a thing that's legally required for entering the market, i.e. a regulation? In that case, funding will not be an issue, but it'll have to be a so-called \"base line certification\", meaning a LOT of products need to be able to get it. This is a much lower standard than we might want. Think of the CE mark: It indicates that your TV won't set the house on fire, but it doesn't guarantee it's well made in any other way.\n* Reach: If however the standard we aim for is higher, than by definition less products will qualify, meaning it must almost by definition be a voluntary thing. Which is good for many things, but means we're now talking about massive outreach or marketing, and likely about requiring a business model. If however you get paid for issuing this, then there's already a potential conflict of interest to issue as many as possible, so it might erode trust into the mark itself.\n* For anything connected, a software update might change important details or features, and also what happens to the data is often something that happens far from the actual product in the cloud, or on third party servers. Whatever the trustmark promises, it needs to apply to every party that has access to the data or that is involved in bringing this product into the world.\n* Verification: How does the issuing body verify its claims? Are there external audits (good but expensive), is it based on companies providing the info (cheap but harder to trust), or some hybrid?\n\nDoteveryone, for example, has studied this in depth [and decided not to go the route of a trustmark](https://doteveryone.org.uk/2019/09/digital-products-and-services-arent-bananas/) and instead just to offer guidelines for making better products, as has the [Better IoT initiative](https://betteriot.org), and frankly with ThingsCon we were short of going that same route (but were really curious to see if we could make it happen - and we'll know in a few years time).\n\nOpportunities:\n\n* I'd offer the counter claim to what @hugi was saying about consumers' attitudes towards privacy and data protection (thanks Hugi for sharing this; I agree with pretty much the rest you're saying), as well as potential damages. Currently it's not like consumers have a real choice, and if you have to choose between unsafe and not using important services, you'll have to expose yourself to the risk. I think consumers care about privacy quite a lot and make the best choices they can, but only have a very narrow band of choices. I also believe that it's not nearly as niche as it's often portrayed and instead the damage in fraud, eroded trust, lost productivity, etc. is quite large, even though I hasten to add I haven't studied this in-depth (so take it with a grain of salt).\n* Nobody has figured out what this means for connected products yet. This is a huge opportunity, because consumers are largely in the dark about what's ok and what isn't. Currently we see a giant market failure there.\n* A trustmark, whichever shape it takes, could also be complementary to regulation that heavily fines sloppy practices if they hurt consumers. There are many mechanism to potentially make this happen; I'm not familiar with the current state of debate around this, but I'm sure Harry might know. \n* Finally, I'd say that consumers would hugely benefit from a trustmark if it's established and gains traction, even if they don't know the details of what it checks for. Let's face it, most trustmarks we trust work in ways we're not familiar with, at very different levels, many of which we're so familiar with that depending on context we might not even perceive as such but everybody knows how to interpret according to their own preferences. To give just a few examples from recent debates: Fairtrade; BlueSign; Made in Germany; the fire department colors; CE; and most brand names all the way from Amazon to Red Cross. Trustmarks are everywhere, and they come in many shapes.\n\nOne thing I'd caution against is to come up with One Trustmark To Rule Them All. Either one of the areas tagged above (privacy, fairness, trustworthiness, sustainability, etc etc.) are huge and complex areas. Something can be extremely fair but not at all private, or perfectly secure yet offer no protection against abuse of data in the way the product is designed; etc. etc. Sustainability for technology is *incredibly* hard, as is privacy, especially if we're comparing across jurisdictions/countries/cultures. (Privacy and data protection are interpreted fundamentally differently in the US than in Germany, for example.)\n\nIn the end, whoever creates the mark has to decide what they aim to cover and make choices, including many hard choices. No trustmark will solve all issues for everyone. But it might solve some issues for some, or even for many - and that's absolutely an endeavor worth engaging in.", "created_at": "2019-09-26 20:57:20.627753", "updated_at": "2019-09-26 20:58:29.949061", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1183, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 56.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [59973], "is_liked_by": [2915, 8, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64318, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11566, "post_number": 2, "raw": "That sounds great!

In order to find productive principles we will have to make two moves; one is to go back to the arguments that led to l\u2019Encyclope\u0301die of Diderot et d\u2019Alembert and see if we can find through their arguments a way to unthink and undo the classification as default (every object on the planet can have its own ip address with IPv6)57 and the other one is to find a way to articulate as performative practice the idea of a parallel movement without recursing to a mode of opposition based on anti classification , or oppositional ways of working. Jean Le Rond d\u2019Alembert writes in Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot:\u201c... it is perhaps among the artisans that one should go to find the most admirable proofs of the sagacity, the patience, and the resources of the intellect. I admit that the greater part of the arts has been invented little by little and that it has taken a very long period of centuries in order to bring watches, for example, to the point of\u00181\n\n![page43image2977713424|19.560000x9.000000](blob:https://edgeryders.eu/76dc95c4-8d22-4355-b035-84404f72be9d)![page43image2977713424|19.560000x9.000000](blob:https://edgeryders.eu/76dc95c4-8d22-4355-b035-84404f72be9d)![page43image2977713424|19.560000x9.000000](blob:https://edgeryders.eu/76dc95c4-8d22-4355-b035-84404f72be9d)![page43image2977713424|19.560000x9.000000](blob:https://edgeryders.eu/76dc95c4-8d22-4355-b035-84404f72be9d)\n\nperfection that we see. But is it not the same for the sciences? How many discoveries which immortalized their authors were prepared for by the work of the preceding centuries, even having been developed to their maturity, right up to the point that they demanded only one more step to be taken? And not to leave watch-making,\nwhy do we not esteem those to whom we owe the fusee, the escapement, and the repeating works [of watches] as much as we esteem those who have successively worked on perfecting algebra? Moreover, if I can believe those philosophers who do not so despise the mechanical arts that they refuse to study them, there are certain machines so complicated, and in which all the parts depend so much on each other, that it is difficult to imagine that the invention would be due to more than one man\u201d.\n\nNot only is the mechanical seen as a collaborative effort and process, but the mechanical arts are thought on the same conceptual level as the arts and the sciences, especially because the knowledge gained and the theories put forward build upon layers and\nlayers of collaborative practical experience. The project of the Encyclope\u0301die is the starting point for all questions relating to the Enlightenment and \u201cthe project of the modern library itself\u201d. Yet does this mean that there is no other reading possible in the intentions of the authors of this paradigm of classification? Le Re\u0300ve d\u2019Alembert (1769, first published 1820) shows that for Diderot seeing the world no longer as God but as machine, and seeing Nature as a giant evolutionary organism that is never static but always experimenting, is not contradictory at all. Maybe the process of and will to classify is not the key to begin to dismantle neoliberal capitalism. But if not, then what?\n\nAccording to Jens Kastner: \u201cHowever the transnational guerilla may be seen as a try\nto overcome the frequencies of fields between art and activism described by Bordieu. The respectively own logics of production of theory, art and also politic actions show overlapping and entanglement. This is the basis where it is meant to prepare - however not by identical closements or prefaced contextless communities. But as a transnational guerilla\u201d.\n\n* -  The intrinsic bridge between artistic and social movements offers possibilities to overcome the structural hurdles between these two.\n* -  Universalism as imaginary (the re-connecting of universalism has a certain source in negation of the existing, which defines the artistic internationalism. This is followed by transnational guerilla, as criticism and as an alternative model to the universal community.\n* -  Zapatista self-management and tactics (\u201cIntergalactic meetings against neoliberalism and pro humanism/the human race\u201d, where a few thousands guerill@s [~guerilleros?], intelectuals and activists [orig. germ.: AktistInnen, must mean AktivistInnen] in\nthe chiapanestic jungle (1996) and also in Spain (1997) met, can be seen without hesitation as the birth hour of the globalization-critical movements. It can also be understood as the starting point of the Transnational Guerilla.\n* -  Global mobilisation (in a normative regard transnational guerilla means to step across national borders and at the time it is also a moment of movement beyond traditional or geographic bonds. This is exactly what the TG is trying to archieve: to\u0018\u0018\n\n![page43image2977713424|19.560000x9.000000](blob:https://edgeryders.eu/76dc95c4-8d22-4355-b035-84404f72be9d)\n\ncreate a transnational mode of movement out of the artistic internationalism of the 1960\u2019s.\n\n* -  Multiplicity (For this collective and de-discriminating action a decisive hint is necessary, [which can also be described as] the temporary mark, the come across, the masks of the Zapatistas, the exposing of one\u2019s mode of existence.\n* -  Parallel action (to speak about TG arises the assumption to be part of a minority: not to assign oneself to a suppressed group for reasons of misinterpreted political correctness, but to conclude oneself, to understand oneself as part of a just temporarily secret broad community.\n* -  Pragmatic activism (TG is not a so far un-perfect or an up to now uncomplete community, neither an historical horizon to be fulfilled. It leaves basic illusions behind re-supplied by Agamben, Baumann and Holloway, is coming from zapatistic riots (we are you behind our masks) and is learning from its\u2019 own artistically practices. But it has to be understood as a gutsy, temporary rout not limited to national borders.All these qualities have been coined and developed from a different mindset and frame of thought, culminating in Bricolabs, the collaborative narrative of individuals that investigate, exploit and prototype the loop of open source software, content, spectrum and hardware. Unlike Jens Kastner our trajectory to these qualities as a possible reality for \u2018uncapitalism\u2019 on a global level did not unravel itself through an investigation of the common denominators in the oppositional positions that have all claimed in some way or another the predominance of becoming/das Tun/anti-classification. Our trajectory to these qualities comes from the realisation that old and new technologies such as RFID, biometric identification schemes (gait recognition, intelligent tracking video cameras and on chip DNA testing), active sensor schemes in logistics, clothing, home - are in the process of creating a real world in which connectivities expand beyond our conscious schemes and protocols of interaction.\n\nhttps://www.networkcultures.org/_uploads/notebook2_theinternetofthings.pdf", "created_at": "2019-05-30 13:52:18.230257", "updated_at": "2019-05-30 13:52:18.230257", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1143, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 28.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [54226], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23083, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1341, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Whoa, understand human nature...</b>\n\nThis is a very good question, and some of the answers are surprising.\n\nSomehow, I find that the expectations do not match the reality.\n\nOne even responded \"<em>The ability to understand human nature</em>\".

He founded the [SCimPulse Foundation](http://www.scimpulse.org/about-us/), which he still directs, and is also part of several scientific organisations and commissions, including the working group of NATO for human control over autonomous systems.\n\nMarko feels there is a lot of excitement about AI and a push to accelerate its implementation widely - but that it is crucial we consider AI a \u201cnifty tool\u201d to use with awareness, rather than an impeccable \u201cleader\u201d that must not be questioned. AI systems are only as good as the data inputted and the questions asked of them by humans. This means that the conclusions returned are not free of human biases, but rather potentially amplify them. Essentially, as they are used now, AI systems simply return the same results as humans would, just \u201cfaster and dumber.\u201d\n\nThis is a concern because of the rush to implement AI, particularly in the field of medicine. In medicine there is an expectation of precision, but with so many biological variables, the more precise you get the more you diverge, so large scale information potentially becomes less valuable. For example, in the 1970s, various tools were introduced to help doctors predict the likelihood of certain diseases, but attempts to refine these profiles over the years have hit a barrier. Just as you could play a lottery with 1/1000 odds every day for a thousand days and still not win, there is a crucial difference between \u201cthe destiny of the person in front of you right now, the destiny of every similar person.\u201d\n\nHis argument is not that we should not be developing AI, but that we must consider how we develop and implement it and how we contextualize the information it gives us. If we simply scale up the information we work with now without being informed about the risks, we risk causing serious damage.\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Marco here:**  [What does it take to build a successful movement for citizens to gain control over when, how and to what use automated systems are introduced and used in society?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-does-it-take-to-build-a-successful-movement-for-citizens-to-gain-control-over-when-how-and-to-what-use-automated-systems-are-introduced-and-used-in-society/11075/2)\n\n*Join our Workshop on Inequalities in the age of AI, what they are, how they work and what we can do about them.

Who wants to be a \"patient\"\u00a0and can walk in confidently? Probably very few people, or not even those who need it the most.\u00a0Even the word \"trauma\" is so heavy that I can see how a friendlier setup and human face can help break the ice. Don't know if it's a strict deontological choice, but you might want to try an experiment where you dont use the word at all in your communication (for example for an event), you'd only use \"pain that doesn't go away\" or something..Then you explain the proper terminology while at it.

Unfortunately i was the only person who brought a computer/tablet, so the notes are basically my synthesis of the discussions we had, but i'm asking those who contributed to come on here to add/amend if they want ideas fleshed out. It's also worth noting that my comments and discussion points are missing from here because when i was talking i wasn't taking notes... next time we'll fix that.\n\nA useful learning exercise was to remind people in advance that digital tech is encouraged for these events- better pre-event communication. Harder to do because we wanted to be open to general public as well as invited guests. The next 2 events are already being promoted online through Facebook, so i'll be adding more details about those here as well.\n\nAll in all, i thought that we avoided getting to stuck in the wider, systemic issues, (although they did take up a chunk of the conversation) and we managed to start exploring some of the specific issues facing us on a small scale, local level. We also started exploring interesting, radical ideas and approaches which was nice to hear.\n\nThe final takeaway from the event was that we had a large representation from cultural and arts organisers and managers, but we need to increase the representation of artist voices at these events too. I think this chimes with your experience in Brussels @noemi ?\n![IMG_1538|690x517](upload://aIHypFsL2edwkaryEcAkQaHshJK.jpeg) ![IMG_1550|690x517](upload://pkZkdqqxvB61nQZcQ1TE6W81hl8.jpeg) ![IMG_1553|517x690](upload://mrHIVzYVOGXlSvScaRK1FwVhHtg.jpeg) ![IMG_1554|517x690](upload://wDUqKbHixEaXZoEm1LjFxk5M6Y2.jpeg) ![IMG_1556|517x690](upload://qa2WAgRqe5CFgbN37AiscWgT9eO.jpeg) \nNotes below:\n> \n> Rae - Trustee of The Place Theatre. Involved in the arts & culture movement in Bedford since the early 80s. Some things have moved forwards, very interested to see where we move forwards\n> \n> Elizabeth - works for The Place/freelance - interested in open conversations. New ideas germinating? Cultural identity pushed forward\n> \n> Tess - University lecturer in I.T. -\n> \n> Elaine - BCA director - new to Bedford, previously in Cambridge. BCA has built a new Cultural Partnership (arts leaders and council) New business plan for the organisation. Manifesto for the future of culture in Bedford\n> \n> Phil - Lifebox - home at The Place. Existing since 2012. This year is about what they are, what they want to say. Bedford is unique town culturally. Thriving and diverse culture for a small town. How do we develop and capitalise on that - how we do show other how to do that\n> \n> Nicola - UoB lecturer in English Literature\n> \n> Laura - freelance fundraiser in Bedford and Northampton - background in visual arts with performance arts interests. This conversation has come up before but now may be the time where things begin to change. Interest in how things can be changing with new faces - the right alignments happening. Can it be engineered/forced? What is the economic model that can hold this together? If retail cant hold it, how we change that value system to make that happen.\n> \n> Ina - originally from Moldova - only in Bedford for 3 months - journalist in culture and history. This is a way to start meeting people with those same interests.\n> \n> Paul - former teacher at BedfordModernSchool. Former visitor to the Bowen West, then the Civic. Likes to see The Place as the focus for various activities that are redefining arts & cultural activity outside - public visible manifestations of arts & culture in spaces. Limited number of formal spaces - working outside those formal spaces also valuable.\n> \n> Jih-Wen - Producer for BCA. Drawn to the idea of artists and citizens - working together, partnerships and drawing audiences in. Developing talents and artists - starting where we are - here. Background with the Yarl's Wood Detention Centre - building relationships between Bedford community and the detention centre. Making culture a vehicle to drive forwards.\n> \n> 19:50 Conversation opening: Alex - what draws you to this discussion, what are the key issues you see, what needs to change, what works already, what do we need to know more about? Lots of questions to ask and draw in. \n> \n> Harpur Trust (NGO funder - locally based, large funding)- benefits The Place for small scale\n> Having access to a large scale local NGO funding pot can create a level of reliance on that  type of charity? (elaine)\n> \n> (Rae) - can happen to some charities to consider the HT as a first point of call for ongoing funding. Very few org are reliant (or allowed to be reliant) solely on the HT. Does it skew the income away from citizens who wouldn't otherwise send kids to private education - i.e. can it pull disposable income from citizens into the private education sector?\n> \n> A new Chief Exec may change things there.\n> \n> 10years ago - everyone looked to the council to get stuff done. People's mindset has changed - more of a DIY culture bubbling along now. Much less expectation that the civic society will provide for them. Bins vs Ballet argument. (elaine)\n> \n> How does that change people's mindsets - blame is placed on the council. What role can the council play in the regeneration of units. Rates/rents - problems with this being set at a national level. Local government can provide relief (for NGO/charities only) - They get beaten up in the press/Social Media a lot for things they can't change (there is still an undercurrent of blame/responsibility placed on local governments) - In truth landlords are the problem - persuading them to take risks. In Bedford large chunks of property are often owned by National pension funds, or international owners - not connected to the fabric of the town, of the day to day lives of the citizens. Waiting for the next bubble/rise - happy to sit them empty as part of large 'portfolio' of properties across UK.\n> \n> (Yena) What is the relationship with arts and sponsorship? Who funds it? Government gives a small contribution - is it self funded?\n> \n> Arts Council funds some activity - some people inside/outside.\n> \n> Fund artistic work through corporate activity\n> \n> Apply in August and December for ACE. (laura)\n> \n> From a producer point of view - application writing is a skill. Supporting artistic practice, rather than realising a piece of artistic work. It's about partnerships - supported by different organisations - NPOs (Arts/culture organisations receiving regular, ongoing funding from Arts Council England[ACE]) become gatekeepers for artists and cultural workers, and it is a burden on them (the NPOs) as well. \n> \n> Have to show being supported by multiple strands of income - it's hard work for just artists. It can't be showing commercial interest. Blanacing being able to fund from multiple different sources (lots of meeting/communications) but also not being so well funded that you don't need to apply for this fund. Walking a tightrope.\n> \n> Commissioning artistic work - sustainability of artistic work. - How does it sustain the artist, but also those around the artist. And what about the audiences? To what extent are artists responsible for engaging with audiences?\n> \n> 'New power' - Henry Timms (former Arts&Business - NYC) - old power structures inherent in ACE. (Laura - suggested to understand the structure at play behind ACE)\n> \n> Power structures hold us back - not lithe, not able to respond quickly to changing habits, learning, landscapes.\n> \n> ACE/Local Authorities are stuck in the same bracket - both old fashioned hierarchies, slow to change, but ultimately with their heart in the right place.\n> \n> Commercial funding/sponsorship? - not so much outside of cities - what the big offer to them? - What are the assets that are being covered?\n> \n> Small scale funding from local people and businesses - selling to businesses is a very different skill set - not 'fundraising' but sales.\n> \n> Do businesses have a responsibility to fund arts & culture directly? - attaching your artistic product to businesses can be a difficult issue - people want to know what their brand is being attached to(and visa versa). Tate/BP as an example.\n> \n> Let's explore 'civic' space as an idea - old fashionned? - Alex talked about how little communal space is owned publicly (often held by developers or private landlords) hidden public spaces, secretly private public space. Wanting to talk about 'the common's (e.g. space available for the use of all) but without alienating people who don't know what that is. \n> Civic has an old fashioned patriarchal sense to it? - Trying to attach some of the past meaning to it, meaning forward thinking, future, unafraid to make bold choices, post-welfare state, 1950/60s optimism - new building, new growth, new communities.\n> \n> Civic 'pride' - (Pride in Bedford) - an initiative to get things going. Attempt to make it more emotive - became LOVE Bedford instead. Became retail and spending/growth oriented. But can be re appropriated for a different context\n> \n> Baz Kershaw (author)- community theatre to connect with communities. - what is our main idealogy? Capitalist. Shifting mindsets - what is the most important things to us?\n> \n> Influencing other people in power - George Monbiot - GDPR as measurement of success in broken.\n> \n> Frustration that the economic argument is the only way to get through 'at the moment'. How can we speak of the inherent quality of arts and culture, without having to sell their 'value'?\n> \n> How do we explore the areas of criticism in artistic practice. No political edge or teeth.\n> \n> We have commoditified everything - even students. There's no radical student body.\n> \n> How do we turn the negativity in our common spaces and the need together? So much online anger at the changes to the retail landscape, old shops shutting, new businesses closing quickly, new developments sitting empty - this leads to lots of online frustration and anger, but not to a movement. Sense that Bedford is 'dying' but even though this is a vibrant and busy time for many its hard for the new shoots to break through the dead old wood.\n> \n> If people are comfortable they aren't radical - remove the comforts. (we had a joke here about blockading the train station and turning off the electricity in the town)\n> \n> High visibility stuff - topical - speaking to people directly - how do we make a bigger splash?\n> \n> Open programme - finding spaces where we can find people\n> \n> Appealing to a lifestyle or educational, or things that connect. A shared programme of activities that can be touch points across many places. - working in partnership - working with multiple communities to speak to the whole population.\n> \n> Building an opportunity that artists want to pitch into. Do we have too many administrators and not enough artists in Bedford?\n> \n> What is the security element? -\n> \n> Is there a thing around basing yourself in Bedford and building from that?\n> \n> What is the cultural ecology that nutures artists? What are the structures that cover constant building. Is growth sustainable?\n> \n> \n> 20:45 Action points for the near future: What do you need help with? Can you help someone?\n> \n> Rae - cultural partnership opportunity - a platform - objective to build a cultural manifesto - where are the views of the residents of Bedford.\n> \n> Laura - shift in thinking away from orgs/structures. Change has to come from the artists. Attracting more people in away from the structuralists. Is there a mechanism to make it happen at a more anarchic/creative level - can we do it without mentioning ACE?\n> \n> Jih-Wen - attracting more artists and producers to the town? Or how do we activate those people within our community already - and make them work HERE! A call for help and support from those outside the doors\n> \n> Elaine - Local authority - new portfolio holder for Arts&Culture. Creative Bedfordshire needs rebolstering. Joint ownership of that network/group. What do artists want? Is this a mechanism. Creative workspaces? What is the future for these? Is the artist space a thing we can reasses? Revenue poor but capital rich orgs. Finding that creative ecology\n> \n> Ina - artists as actors of change. Press and journalism can help with this - a lack of exposure. The need for citizen journalists - creating mouthpieces for people to challenge and create visibility.\n\n\nAs you can see towards the end we started to talk about the next steps - ideas to discuss further. I'm going to feed back to participants directly and see if they have any specific ideas about the next step. One of the things i want to look at for our July event is people bringing case studies of interesting initiatives from elsewhere - perhaps we can learn more about what different ideas we could develop here. \nWe also want to have more representatives from the local authority and regional level funding organisations present for future conversations.", "created_at": "2019-05-16 13:21:49.660377", "updated_at": "2019-05-16 13:21:49.660377", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2078, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 143.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15555, "user_id": 115, "topic_id": 3144, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>is there a way I can be flagged to thoshot happenings with URL?</b>\n\n@noemi I'd be happy to create new sections in the \\#countonme daily updates that give us all insight into new projects we need to be supporting.

Maybe @RobvanKranenburg has some answers here.\n* What is keeping entities accessing your \"pod\" or \"data wallet\" or whatever saving a copy of your data, and then cross-referencing it with whatever else? Technically, of course, they *have to* copy your data. Legally (at least under the scenario of restrictive data protection regulations) they are supposed to delete them, but... will they? Facebook is rumored to have an \"you account\" even if you yourself do not have a Facebook account, and never had one. Would this kind of scenario be prevented by Solid/Wireline?

We\u2019re talking about more than 20%.\n\n\u201c...22.5% of families live below the relative poverty line and almost 20% of the economy is black (market) and illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition to this, there is an influence of the organized crime or so called mafia.\u201d\n\n**How it began**\n\n\u201cPeople got tired of the local situation. Everything started at the beginning of the nineties, after the murders of the most important and most famous anti-mafia judges,\u201d Giacomo explained\n\n\u201cThey started, citizens, to self-organize themselves in organizations, movements, and try to change things locally, where they were directly engaged.\n\n## **First project**\n\nA foundation was established and the group went to a local minister, asking to help reintegrate patients who had criminal record and were placed in a psychiatric facility back into society.\n\n\u201c(we) went to the minister and said, look, this jail costs a lot to society because you are spending thousands of euros per year per person there. And you\u2019re not solving anything,\u201d Giacomo said.\n\n\u201cWe - the foundation - suggest a different possibility. You provide us with a lump sum amount, which is, the amount you spend for one year per person. We are able to get out of there and we insure you that we\u2019ll be able to raise, serve that person into society.\u201d\n\n**The state agreed to let 56 people from the institute be involved in the project.**\n\n\u201cThey used it (the money the state would spend on the care of the 56 in the facility) to invest in a\nphotovoltaic plant\u2026 that was used by several public institutions and, families, above all poor families living in Messina\u201d Giacomo said\n\n\u201cFree energy to the people who are hosting the panels and public subsidies were going directly to the foundation of an income flow that was granted for 20 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people from the psychiatric institute were inserted in several cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, or even the co-operative that was created\u2026 to implement the power plants\u201d\n\nThe employers paid a wage based on the serving of work done, while the foundation made up the remaining sum needed to reach a fair wage with its income from the subsidies. Supports were also put in place for those who were reintegrating\n\n## What we can learn from this?\n\nAlberto highlighted:\n\n1. It used the public spending on the health care of very serious patients to reintegrate some of them into a kind of normal life,\n2. It managed to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in town\n3. It spawned several new businesses - these cooperatives that are doing things like landscaping and maintenance and so on and so forth.\n4. It managed to fund the activity of the foundation as a policy maker.\n5. The fact that now there are hundreds of businesses and households and schools and hospitals that have had solar panels installed by the Messina foundation means they are friends:\n\n**\u201cIn English this will be called relational goods and varies with the idea in economic theory, we think of goods, commodities, not so we just trade them. They rightly point out that some goods store value because they include relationships.\u201d**\n\n## Second model - social housing\n\n\u201cFreedom is the main objective with the foundation. And when we say expansion argument freedoms, we are referring to the Amartya Sen\u2019s capabilities approach - which means expanding the opportunity of choice for people, above all the weakest,\u201d Giacomo said.\n\n\u201cIn Messina, there are some slum neighbourhoods.They started back in 1908. after the earthquake of 1908 and after the bombing of the second world war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are very, hard places, where to live, we did research and discovered that just\u2026 people living there have a life expectancy that is seven years lower than the average of the rest of the city. It\u2019s controlled by crime. It\u2019s highly deprived.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of these people out of these slums, we\u2019re talking about 2,500 families, totally living in the slums neighborhoods. And we, our project, affected about 200 families. So 700 people, totally.\u201d\n\n**The foundation offered people three options:**\n\n1. One was to actually go through the public programs - pay low rent, house is owned by state\n2. Part of the slums were demolished and on the site new eco houses were built with modern tech and energy efficient. Families had a choice to get one of these.\n3. Take a lump sum from the state that covered 80% the price of the house - giving them a choice on their housing solution. The Foundation set up a microcredit institute and loaned the remaining 20%. Set up the support to teach and guide people who are financially illiterate through this choice.\n\n\u201cYou empower them by giving them ownership of choice,\u201d Giacomo explained.\n\n**\u201cLet\u2019s say (you change) the mind of one person, two, 200 people, 700 people. Then, you start changing step by step, the general approach in the local, local society.\u201d**\n\n---\n\n** **Over the years and in part based on the culture of the founders,The foundation was able to come up with practices that are self-evident to them, but counterintuitive to us.**\n\n\n**One example: they have assembled an art collection without buying any of the pieces.**\n\nThey acquired them all through donations or artist residencies. The collection is worth several millions now, and Guggenheim has tried to acquire it, but of course the foundation can never sell it without destroying the goodwill that made it possible to acquire it in the first place.\n\n**That the collection cannot be sold does not mean it is worthless.**\n\nIt has value in two senses: as the embodiment of the relationship of mutual trust between the Foundation and artists, and as a collateral to roll out revenue-generating projects. The collection is valued not for its resale value, but for its potential to grow and catalyze more activities. You do not realize this value by cashing out on the asset, but by stewarding and growing it. This is a very different value theory from the one dominant in capitalism and neoclassical economics. It is an example of the kind of thinking that can emerge from mutual aid communities. This is where Edgeryders wants to be.\n\nWhile seemingly simple and fairly easy to adopt these principles in other places, it is also easy to underestimate the complexity of local differences and embeddedness, as well as of local and regional inequalities.**\n\n## Can these models be replicated? Only if the change from system to network takes place\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of networks, just a lot of entities that are cooperating among themselves but keeping their identity and keeping their position and their activity. They are independent and autonomous. They just (focus) on specific issues and decide to work with other entities where anyway, they see a profit for them, for themselves,\u201d Giacomo explained.\n\n\u201cA creation of a system means having entities that are able also to change themselves, to modify their structure, to adapt themselves to the context, to get closer to the other entities in order to work for a common project and a common dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat makes local territorial systems capable of becoming self-organizing entities?\u201d Giacomo asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite an issue, a point that we want to also understand and to be able to see where we can work in cooperating with these other territorial systems throughout the Mediterranean basin.\u201d\n\n## Let\u2019s break down some of the ways the Foundation operates\n\n**Subsidies vs stocks**\n\nThe foundation buys stocks so it can maintain its own flow of money and maintain its independence.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re always asking for flow from external, investors or entities, you also have to normally\u2026 comply with their requirements in order to get that kind of flow,\u201d Giacomo said.\n\nInvestors don\u2019t like the co-operative structure which limits the growth of many social enterprises.\n\n\u201cSo the governance in the corporate system, you have one had one vote. So it doesn\u2019t matter how much money you\u2019ve put in it. You have one head, you have one vote. this obviously has an impact on the capacity to collect equity. Investors are not so happy to invest a lot of money,\u201d Giacomo highlighted.\n\n**Stocks allow the foundation to make a ten year strategic plan.**\n\n**Recognising that economy has a direction**\n\n\u201cEconomy actually has a direction and that direction is easy in your case it is producing more freedom for people,\u201d Alberto said, highlighting the idea that innovation considered economic growth rate but not the direction is flawed.\n\n\u201cIn innovation policy\u2026 we should have missions. We should have the Apollo program, the decriminalisation of the economy and then we will create in practice more and better growth,\u201d he explained, making reference to economist Mariana Mazzucato.\n\n**Creating things that benefit all society**\n\nThe foundation supported a local brewery that was going to be shut down through a workers buyout option. This ties into the idea of relational goods.This is when you encode human relationship with physical goods. \n\n\u201cThe tradition of the brewery has had an impact on the whole local society, not just that were going to be fired.\u201d\n\nThe Messina crowd allied with laid off brewery workers to start a new brewery. The beer made there encodes human values of dignity, local regeneration and hope.\n\n**Systems over networks**\n\n The foundation acts like a malleable system that adapts to change rather than acting as an independent organisation that is solving one probblem. (This is a capitalist model and how businesses begin but a system that social enterprises mock too.)\n\n **Dyson\u2019s sphere model**  ( the Dyson sphere is an imaginary artifact built all around a star to capture its energy. The idea is to create prosperity for every member of the system: when a client comes around wanting, say, a consultant to organize a workshop, they are immediately asked if they also need a venue, a translation service, a travel agency and so on\u2026 all parts of the system).\n\n## Other models, discussions and thoughts from our breakout sessions\n\n**The Cleveland model**\n\n**Stoneybatter festival**  in North Dublin suggested as an example of bringing together a diverse group of people. It is an old area that had high rates of crime and historically concentrated social housing, with newer professionals recently moving into the area.\n\n**Public housing model in Vienna**\n\n**Differences and similarities between Sicily and Sweden:**\n\n\u201cSweden really trusts civic society\u2026 but I would say the demographic of Sweden has changed and become a less equal society\u2026 So now it\u2019s actually quite unequal in terms of how much support the risks from civic society\u2026\u201d Hugi said.\n\n\u201cWe are very aware of the overhead that comes with it because for every group you go into, there\u2019s going to be a minority within that group that are difficult to work with and they need a lot of support.\u201d\n\n**Those in favour of a circular economy**\n\n\u201cIf you look at everything else on this earth, it\u2019s circular, except everything we created is non-circular,\u201d Oscar said.\n\n\u201cWhat I think for long term sustainability is a circular economy. In the beginning it might be more expensive for the implementation, but in the long term should yield better results,\u201d Bojan said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think any investment, usually you have to have an investment. It seems expensive, if it works out it\u2019s high risk, maybe it\u2019s a gamble. If it works out, you\u2019ll get it back, you\u2019ll come back. And if your thinking is circular, it has to come back because it\u2019s circular, whatever you put in, will come back,\u201d Christina said\n\n## What can we implement from the lessons learned from Messina?\n\nNora Bateson says that systems when they are stuck they don\u2019t get unstuck if someone says it, but only if the systems learn together. Experience of creating transcontextuality - experiences with different identities, empathy, get the glimpse of the context of others, go beyond the polarisations and the idea of the democratic process. Lack of trust in society - part of the core things not working. Automatization of who we are. The idea of subsidiarity - top down, not bottom up and it is completely missing as well the dynamic ways of doing policies. We need a dynamic way of testing and designing policies and interventions. Locally driven and context dependent. Forget about the scalability.\n\nA key aspect is that we are going to need to experiment new processes and models for working with movement building to get something to happen, and then protect its integrity for long enough that the desired results become visible. A process which embeds the means to strengthen the political/ideological movements that have supported and protected it.\n\nAn interesting example of what happens when you don\u2019t manage to do this is the Finnish Basic Income experiment. A well thought through proposal originally came from progressive activism. but was co-opted by the political platform of the liberals which then executed it badly - ignoring fundamental elements. For example that you would need to give basic income to a sample of minimum 30,000 individuals (if I recall correctly) - and that the citizens to include should be selected randomly, and not just people on social welfare etc. Both conditions were not fulfilled. Also, it ran for less than half of the time estimate for the experiment to succeed in meeting its main target: it did not bring about significant employment effects (Demos Helsinki has published the [full report here](https://www.demoshelsinki.fi/en/2020/05/08/letter-results-of-finlands-basic-income-experiment-will-help-us-build-the-post-pandemic-society)).\n\n### One conclusion we draw is that we need to embed the idea of Citizen Engagement as community action on experimenting local development economic models, rather than as citizen-to-institution consultation.\n\nBecause the citizen-engagement-as-consultation mindset is not looking at the issue of power. Consulting citizens is one of those ideas that sound like a no-brainer, but it is very difficult to get the incentives aligned right for. It\u2019s like experiments: the idea of policy experiments sounds great, but try proposing in a European forum \u201clet\u2019s have an experiment: revoke the copyright directive for Latvia\u201d. You won\u2019t get far, because the powerful people  *already*  have what they want.

I\u2019d much rather have short, regularly scheduled research coordination efforts on our projects than continue to try and get information on what's going on in an ad hoc way. If people agree, cool, then they can jump on the call with me every other week and learn about the ethnography progress (and if community managers end up joining once a month, the community management progress too)\n\nI know from many conversations with them both that @johncoate and @MariaEuler would prefer more structure and more face-to-face checkins, and @katejsim and @Leonie have both explicitly asked for these too (which is why the biweekly coding meeting now exists). So I will go ahead and do this for NGI. \n\nPOPREBEL can continue to be ad hoc if people prefer it that way. I've no intention to make anyone join any meeting or check-in that they don't want to.

That's fine and you are of course both welcome to do whatever you want-- that's how Edgeryders works. But it's not working for me, so (like @matthias mentioned on another thread) I'm making changes to try to make my workflow easier, and anyone who feels the way that I do is welcome to add another meeting to the schedule / try to brainstorm how to update each other in a more structured and consistent way.     \n\nOn this topic, Jo Freeman has an excellent article on the [Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm). @katejsim uses it when she teaches workshops on organising, actually. Freeman argues, I think very accurately, that there is no such thing as a structureless organisation -- only those who make structures explicit, and those who leave them implicit (which means that the structure ends up being that of those who are dominant in the group).", "created_at": "2020-09-30 13:35:57.454970", "updated_at": "2020-09-30 13:37:37.004091", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 440, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 103.0, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [84017], "is_liked_by": [4934, 4096, 5479, 2915, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32114, "user_id": 37, "topic_id": 1625, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Little photogallery:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.430495910315901.100463.100000664872171&amp;type=3\n\nA post on CheFuturo!, italian online magazine:\n\nhttp://www.chefuturo.it/2012/06/cosa-raccontano-e-fanno-i-giovani-che-cambieranno-leuropa/\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-20 10:34:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:56.488986", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 46, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 71445, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12850, "post_number": 1, "raw": "How is this crisis affecting your work?

Justin now focuses more on data governance, and is finding that as new digital infrastructures are rolled out, they are driven by narrow efficiency concerns and are not accountable. Looking into these new infrastructures is a great opportunity to make the system more participatory and accountable - but we have to take it.\n\nFeeding existing data into AI systems can create problems - for example, when predictive policing has been shown to drive more officers into wealthy areas, as data shows a higher rate of arrests in those areas. Data therefore creates a self-reinforcing loop. Further, digital systems often rely on a binary logic, which healthcare and social problems simply don\u2019t fit. The key problem is that data is a simplification of the real world. Further, some AI systems may support a conservative bias, such as when they are used to predict which offenders are most likely to reoffend.\n\nRegulation of digital infrastructure would be a step in the right direction, and the argument that it would stifle innovation is weak - technological advances must make sense and make lives better. It may not be possible to have 100% compliance, but more involvement of public authorities (even at local level) would be a good step, as would more transparency over how these technologies function.

The competences of Yves Royet include Urbanism, Heritage,\nMobility, Quality of life and Animal Welfare.\n\nTo introduce our meeting, we presented the\nconcept of The Reef. We also gave them a brief description of the different\nworkgroups (Community building, climate innovative technology, climate\ninnovation living lab, finance,). We explored how The Reef project could match\nwith the local strategy of the Municipality with the focus on transition and\nurbanism. They confirmed that transition, ecology and the idea of connecting our\nactivities with the local neighbourhood are important themes that are very much\nappreciated by the local authorities in Ixelles. These topics are also strongly\nintegrated in the new policy statement.\n\nHere is what we learned and discussed:\n\n1.    \nWe discussed about different\nbuildings that will probably be transformed in the near future, but most of\nthem are too large for The Reef project and are already owned by private\ndevelopers. They also mentioned the spot of the former police caserns (Usquare),\non the corner with the avenue de la Couronne and the boulevard General Jacques\nin Ixelles. They advised us to contact the director of the SAU (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nd\u2019Am\u00e9nagement Urbain), who owns the site and who is in charge of the future\ndevelopment of the spot. At this moment, you can already have a first glance at\nthe location since you can visit the temporary use initiative set up on this\nspot ([www.see-u.brussels](http://www.see-u.brussels)).\nUsquare is a regional initiative that will be developed on the same spot (after\nthe temporary use project). Usquare will be developed in very close\ncollaboration with two major Brussels based universities: the ULB and the VUB.\n\n2.    \nUsquare is one of the\n10 different large regional neighbourhoods that will be reshaped during the\ncoming years. Most of these 10 PAD\u2019s (Plan d\u2019Am\u00e9nagement Directeur) are managed\nby the SAU. These other development sites might also be interesting spots to\nexplore for a future installation of The Reef project.

The proposal demonstrated the Commission\u2019s increased ambition concerning climate-related activities and proposed to spend 25% of expenditure on such activities, amounting to EUR 320 billion, to be mobilised through the EU budget. The Commission later adopted, on 29 and 30 May 2018, its legislative proposals governing the use of cohesion policy funding for the same period. One of the main objectives which will drive EU investments in 2021-2027 will be a \u201cGreener, low-carbon Europe, by promoting clean and fair energy transition, green and blue investment, the circular economy, climate adaptation and risk prevention and management\u201d implementing the Paris Agreement. According to the Commission\u2019s proposal, a significant share of cohesion funding will focus on this priority. It will be essential to confirm that share in the ongoing legislative process. On 11 December 2019, the Commission adopted a Communication on the European Green Deal, setting out its roadmap towards a new growth policy for Europe.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nThis growth policy is based on ambitious climate and environmental objectives and on participatory processes bringing citizens, cities and regions together in the fight against climate change and for environmental protection. In line with the objective of achieving EU climate neutrality by 2050 in an effective and fair manner, the European Green Deal proposed a Just Transition Mechanism, including a Just Transition Fund, to leave no one behind. Funding will be available to all Member States, while focusing on those regions and sectors that are most affected by the transition given their dependence on fossil fuels, including coal, peat and oil shale or greenhouse gas-intensive industrial processes. The fund will support workers, companies, and regional authorities, encouraging investments that facilitate the transition.\n\n**GENERAL FRAMEWORK**\n\nThe proposed budget for the Just Transition Fund (JTF) is \u20ac7.5 billion, to be complemented with resources from cohesion policy funds and national co-financing (up to a total of \u20ac30-50 billion). The Commission expects the three pillars of the Just Transition Mechanism \u2013 the Just Transition Fund (\u20ac30-50 billion), the InvestEU scheme (up to \u20ac45 billion), and the EIB loan facility (\u20ac25-30 billion) \u2013 to mobilise at least \u20ac100 billion of investments.\n![jtf02_framework|690x426](upload://3wai6QAiZOB3pobu2Cgb3FxofZH.png) \n\nThe Just Transition Fund will be implemented under the cohesion policy. Its delivery will follow the amended Common Provisions Regulation and be included in partnership agreements and programmes. The JTF's own specific budget will be complemented with resources from the ERDF, ESF+, or a combination of the two, through obligatory transfers. The total of ERDF and ESF+ resources transferred to the JTF should be between 1.5 and 3 times the amount of the JTF budget. In order to ensure continued impact of cohesion policy, the resources transferred from either the ERDF or ESF+ cannot exceed 20 % of the respective ERDF and ESF+ allocations to any individual Member State (new proposed article 21a of the amended CPR). Member States are also expected to provide funding of their own, with levels of EU co-financing depending on the category of the region in which the 'just transition territory' is located. The remaining two pillars of the Just Transition Mechanism \u2013 the InvestEU scheme and the EIB loan facility \u2013 will have a broader geographical and thematic scope than the JTF, being available to territories outside the 'just transition' zone, on condition that projects are beneficial to 'just transition territories' \u2013 for example, transport or energy infrastructure projects that improve the connectivity of these territories. The two pillars will also cover a broader range of activities, for instance district heating and gas networks, energy efficiency of buildings, energy and transport infrastructure, and social infrastructure. The Just Transition Fund will primarily provide grants. The InvestEU scheme will seek to bring in private investment, whereas the EIB loan facility will leverage public funding.\n\n**SCOPE OF SUPPORT**\n\nThe Just Transition Fund will only finance activities that are directly related to its specific objective and that contribute to the implementation of the territorial just transition plans. It will support workers, companies, and regional authorities, encouraging investments that facilitate the transition. The activities supported are restricted to a) productive investments in SMEs (including start-ups) that lead to economic diversification and reconversion, b) investments in the creation of new firms, including support for business incubators and consulting services, c) investments in research and innovation activities that foster the transfer of advanced technologies, d) investments in the deployment of technology and infrastructure for affordable clean energy, as well as in greenhouse gas emissions reduction, energy efficiency, and renewable energy, e) investments in digitalisation and digital connectivity, f) investments in regeneration and decontamination of sites, land restoration, and repurposing projects, g) investments that enhance the circular economy, including those that promote waste prevention, reduction, resource efficiency, reuse, repair and recycling, h) upskilling and reskilling of workers, i) job-search assistance to jobseekers, j) active inclusion of jobseekers, and k) technical assistance. The fund may also support investments in enterprises other than SMEs, and investments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions resulting from activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC (EU emissions trading system \u2013 ETS), as long as they have been approved in the territorial just transition plans and are necessary for the implementation of those plans.\n\n**TERRITORIAL JUST TRANSITION PLANS**\n\nThe support from the Just Transition Fund will be based on the territorial just transition plans and programmed under one or more priorities, either in programmes supported also from the ERDF, the ESF+ or the Cohesion Fund or in a dedicated Just Transition Fund programme. Territorial just transition plans will be prepared by the Member States, together with the authorities of the territories concerned and the relevant partners specified in article 6 of the new CPR. The selection of territories should be made on the basis of the economic and social impacts of the transition, especially with regard to employment in the fossil fuel sector and the transformation needs of industries with the highest greenhouse gas intensity. One or more territorial just transition plans can cover one or more affected territories \u2013 NUTS 3 level regions or parts thereof. The territorial just transition plans must describe the transition process at national level and aim towards a climate-neutral economy, including a timeline of key steps consistent with the National Energy and Climate Plans. The territorial just transition plans will be part of the programmes and will be adopted by the same Commission decision as the programme.\n\n**ALLOCATION METHOD**\n\nThe Just Transition Fund will provide support to all EU Member States, while concentrating on those territories and regions where the magnitude of the climate transition is larger. The allocation method is based on objective and clear criteria.\n\nAs the JTF should contribute to mitigate the socio-economic impact in the regions and sectors most affected by the transition due to their reliance on fossil fuels or energy intensive industries, the criteria reflect the relevant economic and social indicators of the Member States and regions concerned:\n\n1. Greenhouse gas emissions of industrial facilities in regions where the carbon intensity of those emissions exceeds the EU average.\n2. The level of employment in the mining of coal and lignite.\n3. The level of employment in industry in the regions referred to under point 1.\n4. The production of peat.\n5. Production of oil shale.\n\nThe economic criteria (GHG emissions, production of peat, production of oil shale) and the social ones (employment in coal and carbon intensive regions) weigh 50% each in the calculations.\n\nIn order to ensure an appropriate concentration of resources on the least developed Member States, GNI per capita is also factored in. The national shares of the allocation are increased or decreased to reflect the difference between the national GNI per capita and the average EU GNI per capita.\n\nSecondly, an upper limit is introduced to prevent any single Member State receiving an excessive share of the JTF resources and ensure a fairer and balanced distribution between Member States. The upper limit fixed at \u20ac2 billion.\n\nThirdly, a minimum level of aid intensity is set so that each Member State receives an allocation allowing the support of meaningful actions. The minimum aid intensity is set at \u20ac6 per inhabitant.\n\nThis allocation method helps ensure that the distribution of funds is sufficiently concentrated on Member States where the challenges are most important, while offering a meaningful support to all Member States. Notably, the Member States with a GNI/head lower than 90% of the EU average would receive about two thirds of the JTF funding.\n![jtf_ALLOCATION%20METHOD|596x690](upload://7rK1c5pa6GllQtRWjpPHLSsbXL9.png) \n![jtf01_ALLOCATION%20METHOD|690x449](upload://3Suvfy8jJck77myPonbXiN6XqGF.png) \n\n\nFor more information:\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0022,\n\nhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2020/646180/EPRS_BRI(2020)646180_EN.pdf,\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_20_66.", "created_at": "2020-05-26 16:06:24.018270", "updated_at": "2020-05-26 16:13:36.852071", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1492, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 56.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64730, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 11633, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Welcome.

A  **proximate**  co-occurrence is one that exists in the same sentence or paragraph, that the informant explicitly connects. The example we discussed: \u201cThe healthcare system in Poland is low quality.\u201d The co-occurrence between  `healthcare system`  and  `low quality`  there is proximate. A  **distant**  co-occurrence happens when a community member mentions the healthcare system in one part of their post, and mentions low quality later in the post. We were then trying to think of ways that we could determine the difference between these two.\n\n* For my first answer, I put my @alberto hat on \u2014 if the two concepts reliably co-occur across many posts and comments, then they could be interpreted as proximate regardless, because the increase in number of co-occurrences indicates that these are consistently being tied together by multiple community members, reducing the likelihood of this happening incidentally.\n* Anthropologically speaking, this works for co-occurrences but leaves us with the question of capturing the underlying annotations, which @Jan values (wanting to be able to generate a list of annotations where the two concepts co-occur). We thought of two options for being able to do this.\n\n1. If an ethnographer feels strongly about capturing an annotation list of annotations where both concepts co-occur, they could create a compound code ( `low-quality healthcare` ), but also apply the two separate codes as well. This way you have the annotation list in the backend under the compound code. This is also a  **short term**  solution to this problem as it doesn\u2019t require any changes to OE, but isn't ideal because we are creating compound codes.\n2. Preferred solution - give the ability to generate a co-occurrence annotation list of all the annotations where two codes co-occur and compare to posts/comments where two codes co-occur, but not in the same annotation. Now that we can add multiple codes at a time, this should be possible. \n\nNumber 2 would also allow us to do a little \u201cfalse co-occurrence\u201d test, testing whether the first proposition is correct (that frequency will smooth over false links). An example of an annotation that would show us the link is false \u2013 a post where the community member discusses a great experience with Polish healthcare in the top of the post, but later on in the post discusses how low-quality cars in Poland are.\n\nIt is worth noting that we leave room for some flexible interpretation here, because people make implicit connections between what might initially look like  **distant**  connections, and we want to leave room for novelty \u2014 to be surprised that cars and healthcare are often mentioned in the same post, should that be the case.\n\nThe last potential enhancement we propose for this is to be able to indicate breaks in posts that make the system view them as separate contributions, if we see that the post is really two different conceptual worlds that are unconnected to each other. This would also solve @MariaEuler and @johncoate 's problem with long interview transcriptions --- we could then easily break each contribution from a different person into something the system recognises as separate, so that we could induce a more accurate co-occurrence network as conversation rather than single block text post. \n\n@Jan, you had some things to add here as well.", "created_at": "2020-08-18 09:34:49.440849", "updated_at": "2020-08-18 09:34:49.440849", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 574, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 57.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65401, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 11728, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hello @haykel\n\nNice to have you again in one of our community events.

Why does this law exist and what can we do to change it?\n\n@BlackforestBoi believes it comes down to: Costs to switch (time and mental effort) > additional benefit offered *~10. Such growth requirement has produced some great leaps in innovation - but these come with downsides. How would the world look if we focused more on incremental innovations?\n\nWhat is holding us back? The way companies make money for one: the 2nd quarter of 2018, Facebook lost $120bn (billion!) in stock value within 48 hours, the biggest loss of any company in history. The reason: It posted the least growth since its founding, while still making 5BN in profits the same quarter and growing by 42% since the last year. Secondly data and social lock ins creates counter incentives for interoperable formats which would make it easier for users to migrate between services or integrate them,\n\nBreaking this dynamic would require tackling the problem from multiple angles: namely allowing users to move freely between services, creating economic models that reward quality of service rather than simple growth, and ideally adopting Open-Source software to allow companies to build on one another\u2019s work.\n\nWorldBrain (dot) io is building open-source software in an attempt to enable incremental innovation, the foundation of which is Memex - an open-source privacy tool. Interoperability is baked deep into the core of Memex, it is fully open-source and WorldBrain (dot) io has no stock value, so is entirely focussed on building a sustainable service.\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Oliver here:**  [Startups\u2019 grand illusion: You have to be 10x better than whats there](https://edgeryders.eu/t/startups-grand-illusion-you-have-to-be-10x-better-than-whats-there/10221/14)\n\n*Join our Workshop on Inequalities in the age of AI, what they are, how they work and what we can do about them.

We have no real internal way of dealing with interpersonal conflict, especially in hierarchical situations (and particularly where someone new is having trouble with someone who has been around for a while). This has some bad effects. Many of us who are external to the hierarchy or team in question find ourselves doing emotional and interpersonal support work, often without being able to help formally. There's a reason most organisations have either an HR person or a welfare officer, depending on the kind of org. This is another situation where formal structures are our friend -- firstly because when people know the expectations of them, it is easier to feel safe and to meet them.

Sat next to this person was a representative from Airbnb in Amsterdam. Based on what the Councilor was saying it would seem that there were no local groups or organisations that they could collaborate with. I asked whether they had actually reached out to the actors who are already there and the and try to work with them the response was that they were very difficult to deal with: didn't respond to public calls etc., the means at which the councilor had at their disposal to connect with and include local actors.\n\nOn the other hand, there was a younger person there, an activist, who had been trying to get the city administration to do exactly that...work with local groups but was finding it very difficult. For one thing, he stated,\u00a0 the fact that many civil servants had indeed used services like airbnb privately when travelling biased them towards this service as opposed to some local small service that they had never heard of.\n\nResilience as I understand it is very much about people with complimentary skills and reach out into different networks and resources being in touch with one another and being reachable for others. It's about a social fabric needing to be in place so people can respond quickly and self-organise. And the less that social fabric is dependent on certain corporations the better for many reasons imho. For one thing these companies can go bankrupt or be banned at any time. Some of the actors you name are especially dependent on friendly legislation and have started a lobby organisation, Peers, to try to swing legislation in their favour.\n\nAlso there is the question of data ownership and personal data sovereignty. I am accountable to a certain set of laws, but if the actors on which we make ourselves dependent are not this may cause a lot of problems.\n\nYou have reasons for looking to those kinds of actors first, can you maybe list what the advantages are as seen from your perspective?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-06 09:18:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:44.478737", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 406, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64455, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11309, "post_number": 23, "raw": "The file was discarded somehow...", "created_at": "2019-11-18 08:30:06.463590", "updated_at": "2019-11-18 08:30:06.463590", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [64449], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51496, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 9261, "post_number": 9, "raw": "@matthias Following up on this - do you have the backup available to send to me?", "created_at": "2019-03-08 18:43:13.323154", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 18:43:13.323154", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51794, "user_id": 4945, "topic_id": 9629, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Dear Alex,\n\nCan you please inbox me more details?\n\njasonschumann1(at)gmail.com", "created_at": "2019-03-18 19:51:54.372887", "updated_at": "2019-03-18 19:51:54.372887", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 57.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64736, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11641, "post_number": 4, "raw": "ping @mrchrisadams", "created_at": "2019-11-19 17:41:38.474107", "updated_at": "2019-11-19 17:41:38.474107", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57718, "user_id": 5201, "topic_id": 10500, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Great, I'll definetely do it (asking questions!).\n\n[quote=\"noemi, post:5, topic:10500\"]\n> Some Edgeryders people may look rough at a first sight\n\nwho?? :-)))\n[/quote]\n\nYou, of course, always grumpy, never smiling... yes, so hard to work with you.

If something is interesting enough, the reader will stick with it, but even then often not to the end.\n\nThis is a big reason why journalistic writing was developed and why you shouldn't \"bury the lede.\"  They knew for years that most reader don't go \"past the fold\" in a newspaper story unless they are on a long bus ride or in a waiting room.  It is not so different online really.  Except for the concept of click bait, which didn't exist before.  I think a lot of bloggers mislead with their headlines and then take as long as possible to get to the point so they will get a better impression count for their ad revenue.  Also, they might just be lousy writers.\n\nI know I was for a long time.  Learning to write clearly and succinctly in this semi-spontaneous  posting medium, while bringing out a compelling story worthy of a reader's attention takes skill and practice.\n\nBut I very much like the exhortation that we continue to try to bring out more the personal side of people.\n\nI think there are a couple of challenges in doing it.  One is that the ER community uses the platform for quite business-like or project-specific purposes.  It is not a social place or a hangout.  This is by design for the most part, and just clearly not the preference of the main participants.  The ER community does a lot of getting to know each other, socializing, meeting up, etc. but it is almost entirely offline and in-person.  I think this works well for the regulars, but does not tend to create that encouraging of an atmosphere for comfortable personal sharing (stories) as a default.  For my part, I try to throw a story or an anecdote into every post I make if I have one i think is worthwhile.  And encouraging more of it in others is something I agree we can do to help enrich the dialogue.\n\nThe other challenge besides this ER platform not really being seen as a hangout, is the nature of the subject matter in NGI. Amelia describes the problem well. Experts likes to share their expertise.  But we have two kinds of experts here: policy and engineering.  I think the engineering participants do inform their work with what they see as an ethos compatible with NGI goals, but like the policy people, they come in and say something then go back to their project.  Maybe asking for updates is a good approach to keep them engaged.\n\nThe policy experts for sure want to see things made that reflect NGI principles, but there seem to not be many of those projects out there to point to.  Finding and highlighting them whenever we find them is, I think, one of the things the EC would like us to be doing here.  Generally, the policy experts, and I see myself as one of them at least to some degree, point out the problems.  I think we have done a good amount of that here.\n\nTunneling our way to solutions or attempts at solutions or raising the profile of individuals who the EC ought to know more about are big parts of what makes this project worthwhile.\n\nI do think that the people interviewed by Peter and Zenna are all interesting and they do tell their own stories in those talks.  Interviews are of course one of the best ways to draw them out of people.\n\nAs for deep green tech: very challenging indeed to define it and we did try to get some better definition of what the term even means specifically, but I think we need to try to get more clarity there.\n\nAnd I like Amelia describing tensions inside some of these issues.  I think none of us believe that tech is going to \"save\" us, but I also think that if we did not have at least some belief in clever tech solutions we would not be involved in these conversations.  I know I feel pretty conflicted about it myself.", "created_at": "2019-10-31 18:48:05.089671", "updated_at": "2019-11-04 07:21:44.462616", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted":

If something is going wrong, it is important to analyze where it went wrong and look at each point of failure and on how to remove each question from from the system (...).\"_ \n\nWe interviewed Jay for the school's project about his irrigation system \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BhMKaSugJRH/?taken-by=copy.adapt.share.thrive\nand how to save water in dry areas such as Dahab. This encounter changed our perceptions of failure and since we returned back we have been experimenting, analyzing and trying again. \n\n\n**THE OWNER OF THE LITTLE OASIS**\n\nThe French owner of the Little Oasis, passed away last summer at the age of 42 leaving behind 3 boys from two fathers, who all lived in Dahab at the time I was there. One of them is the owner of the next door hotel. A garden keeper runs the farm. All the animals and birds either died, been sold or given to the Bedouins. The goats and ducks were gone during our stay. There were only chicken remaining. \n\nI found this movie of the animals who once lived in the place on youtube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsq7WhUKGFU&t=15s\n\nThe energy and spirit of the late owner is still in there though...\n\nI thought we can consider La Petite Oasis as a possible co-working / co-living space in Dahab, Egypt. Due to the limited space, it has to operate differently. People working on similar projects relevant to what we will agree we want to achieve to be present at the same time in waves.\n- Explorers\n- Architects / urban planers / hackers \n- Artists / musicians / environmentalists / anthropologists / work with children \n- horticulture specialists / bartering programs (Dahab is an ideal place to test different alternative economy tools) / business development (work with Bedouins on the production and sales of goat cheese and medicinal herbs / trips a limited number of school children to volunteer and learn by doing / weekly dinner cooked at the Little Oasis + live music or movie screening etc) \netc.\n\nFinally, maybe the owners have other dreams and ideas. I just wanted to share our experience and free the mind for other ideas, experiences and projects. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9aae8a1c7fcc174d67d90e29f2484171f78cc0b9.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">", "created_at": "2018-08-13 12:54:45.892794", "updated_at": "2018-08-13 13:49:42.825033", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1271, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 458.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4085, 137, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62396, "user_id": 4892, "topic_id": 11021, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Wed 15 is perfect, many thx !", "created_at": "2019-10-28 15:13:28.789650", "updated_at": "2019-10-28 15:13:28.789650", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [62392], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78243, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13786, "post_number": 4, "raw": "ping @lroddy", "created_at": "2020-06-04 05:53:44.639628", "updated_at": "2020-06-04 05:53:44.639628", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 684, "user_id": 3243, "topic_id": 651, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Language Barrier \u2013 How can we build a Bridge?</h3>\n\nNon-Germans want to learn German and want to take part in social life.\n\nGermans are not as enthusiastic yet.

This is fantastic. Thanks @alex_levene for sharing your insights and projecting this toward the larger vision of Edgeryders, which it appears is evolving slowly. This is beautiful.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are to consider a Network Analysis of all persons that are active and interested in Edgeryders moving forward and to document these relationships, partnerships, outputs and the overall collaborative aspect of Edgeryders which is : a culture-in-the-making (Thanks @johncoate) and not void of evolving, by nurturing the self and each other and our collective values. Actually that's the only constant I imagine, this collaboration which is shifting. By positioning us all on this map, we can better collaborate, share and progress this network. That's my immediate 2 cents.\n\n1. Funders\nI am not too familiar with funders, as most of my work has been focused on Health/Public Engagement during the last years. I am in a position to present this collaborative approach toward Well-being to the Wellcome Trust if I can swing this as a Progressive Research or Project toward Engagement/Communication or similar. They're very flexible and if we are speaking about co-creation and events that produce real tangible artefacts, we could argue this with this Funder under their Public Engagement grants. It will present a means of being, creating, collaborating and sharing that surpasses geo-territorial conceptions of community.\n\nThat's an initial thought as I will be visiting the funder in September 2018. So let's keep this open as I am on very good terms with them.\n\nMy second thought is: are there any single researchers interested in chronicling and studying the progression of edgeryders and understanding this network. This could be a really great research study and we could apply for funds for this to be done as a research project (Masters or PhD). This could form the basis for a research topic that directly benefits the network and all subscribers?\n\nMy third thought which is one that keeps revisiting me is the idea of Communiversities. These little hubs of knowledge run by persons who have experience and handing over that experience to a new cohort of interested persons. I've been following the model of the Fun Palaces, http://funpalaces.co.uk and have met with their leadership. Could something similar which brings together collective experience, expression, arts ad knowledge be of interest as producing a real world \"artefact\". This is something that could be funded, as Edgeryders is (via one lens) a communiversity of sharing?\n\nAs for the next step of Edgeryders Events, I think these issues highlighted would be phenomenal to have workshopped. With a cohort of interested persons we could tease out the nitty-gritty, and define the next steps in a concentrated effort. We previously spoke about the potential of hosting a camp to this purpose (or rather developing certain ideas/projects further within the network) prior to the next Open Village. Would a concentrated exploratory workshop to this purpose be of interest?\n\nI will give some thought to potential funders in the meantime.", "created_at": "2018-07-20 09:37:43.484291", "updated_at": "2018-07-20 09:37:43.484291", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 513, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 18.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81538, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 14202, "post_number": 20, "raw": "**First Question** <br /> logged in <br /><br /> **Second Question** <br /> sands <br /><br /> **Third Question** <br /> option 2 <br /><br /> **Fourth Question** <br /> option 4 <br /><br /> **Fifth Question** <br /> true <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-08-07 23:09:27.041498", "updated_at": "2020-08-07 23:09:27.041498", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58959, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 10713, "post_number": 2, "raw": " @natalia_skoczylas @alex_levene @zmorda", "created_at": "2019-09-09 12:27:18.955737", "updated_at": "2019-09-09 12:28:10.809585", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 19.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26272, "user_id": 43, "topic_id": 1745, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Grappling my way</b>\n\nHello\n\nThank you so much Helene for sharing so many links here and elsewhere, on culture, sustainability and the commons.

Based on research at Nesta and interviews with leading experts, in our [ **full report** ](https://research.ngi.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NGI-Forward-Digital-Trustmarks.pdf) **,**  we explore whether a digital trustmark is worth pursuing, what it might cover and how it could be governed.\n\n## The potential value of an internet trustmark\n\nTrustmarks are widely used in other sectors, helping consumers recognise trusted providers and make more informed decisions about the goods and services they buy - think, for example, of the [Fairtrade](https://www.fairtrade.org.uk/What-is-Fairtrade/Using-the-FAIRTRADE-Mark) certification label for food and beauty products.\n\nAs part of our research, we spoke to people who develop responsible and ethical technology. As consumer trust in tech companies and digital service providers has [eroded considerably in recent years](https://medium.com/ipg-media-lab/how-tech-companies-are-failing-the-trust-test-1f1057de9317), and identifying trustworthy products remains a significant challenge for internet users, many of the respondents felt that a digital trustmark could be an effective way of protecting, informing and empowering citizens and consumers, whilst promoting transparency, accountability and responsible practice among tech companies.\n\nAmong our interviewees, there was also a sense that the creation of a digital trustmark is a vacuum waiting to be filled - and that, if a trusted institution acting for the public good doesn\u2019t introduce one soon, the gap would likely be filled by commercially-driven and less accountable certification initiatives.\n\n## Existing digital trustmark initiatives\n\nWe found examples of several existing and emerging trustmark initiatives in different areas of the digital space, which aim to address specific problems of different tools and technologies:\n\n* Trustmarks are widely used in the field of  **cybersecurity,**  often by commercial companies like [McAfee Secure](https://www.mcafeesecure.com/for-consumers), to reassure consumers that an application or site is free from viruses and malware.\n* A lot of thinking has already gone into developing a trustmark for the  **Internet of Things (IoT)** , as connected devices have [particular risks](https://www.mozillapulse.org/entry/436) around user data privacy and security breaches. The UK\u2019s [Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/775559/Secure_by_Design_Report_.pdf) has been looking at developing a national labelling scheme for consumer IoT products, and the [ThingsCon](https://thingscon.org/) network have introduced a [Trustable Technology Mark](https://trustabletech.org/) for connected devices.\n* There have been calls from experts in  **Artificial Intelligence**  to introduce a trustmark for algorithms. The [German Data Ethics Commission](https://www.bmjv.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Themen/Fokusthemen/Gutachten_DEK_EN.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1) and the UK-based network [Women Leading in AI](https://womenleadinginai.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WLiAI-Report-2019.pdf) have both recommended a labelling system to make clear when (and in what way) algorithmic systems are being used. Risk consulting firm [ORCAA](https://orcaarisk.com/) has also developed a system of auditing algorithms and certifying those that meet their standards.\n* Several labelling initiatives have been launched to combat  **\u2018fake news\u2019**  and disinformation. [NewsGuard](https://www.newsguardtech.com/) is one such tool developed by journalists to help internet users distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy news sites.\n\nWhile these existing initiatives are promising, so far no one has developed a comprehensive trustmark for the internet. Tools and technologies can be divided into discrete categories, but this doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect a user\u2019s experience - people engage with countless different connected products, services and technologies in their daily life. We were therefore interested in how one might go about developing a digital trustmark that covers many different issues and products at once - from cyber security to sustainability, and if such a comprehensive approach was the right one.\n\n## The challenges of designing an internet trustmark\n\nFrom auditing developers\u2019 black boxes to choosing meaningful product criteria, developing a comprehensive trustmark to address the diverse concerns of internet users presents serious challenges, some of which we have explored further in our full report.\n\nHere, the first challenge we want to focus on is a conceptual one: how to design a trustmark that is simple enough for users to understand, while still conveying meaningful information about dynamic and complex digital technologies.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, having separate trustmarks for different digital tools would make sense. After all, it is difficult to imagine a specific list of standards that are meaningful across the vast range of internet products, services and systems. However, having several little-known, potentially competing or overlapping trustmark initiatives is likely to have the opposite of the desired effect, serving only to cause greater [confusion](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pO6aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT68&dq=too+many+trustmarks+and+too+little+knowledge+of+their+existence+and+credibility&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1oPXx_LzmAhXtQxUIHUhEB18Q6AEIMjAB#v=onepage&q=too%20many%20trustmarks%20and%20too%20little%20knowledge%20of%20their%20existence%20and%20credibility&f=false) and even [distrust](https://econsultancy.com/which-e-commerce-trustmarks-are-most-effective/) among consumers. A single, comprehensive trustmark across diverse internet products, services and issues may stand a better chance of becoming widely recognised, and ultimately building consumer trust.\n\nOne potential solution is to create an  **\u2018umbrella\u2019 trustmark**  - this would balance the consumer\u2019s need for a single, easy-to-identify trustmark with the organisational and technical need for differentiated product criteria. The umbrella trustmark could act as an overarching brand that consumers recognise as a sign of trustworthiness across the internet, while behind the scenes there would be an organisational ecosystem which defines and evaluates different standards for different tools.\n\nSuch a trustmark could build on a well-established labelling scheme, like the  **traffic light system**  (the red-amber-green labels commonly used for [nutritional information](https://www.nutrition.org.uk/healthyliving/helpingyoueatwell/324-labels.html?start=3&__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=fca2efe8566c49881c049d96d0738be16e755950-1576596769-0-AfpsAuj-1sd3QvniTP2XP9wjC9pr2z4tj6HIFC22BN9EWgiZg8E56PZFB53WhvAlhUPYOncUXq5fx8ekGGWJf1D2HXikOx2rbVXJtEqWMTfuy7PyyJrLsvKOqZDNLUOctSKrcbmDaJwyUxhuApqxKXD4TtZbyrHcibG15mt-Bk15mMpU-3HsrUF0IxEvOxZAHyvegQyAoluLvclbo8ZvRcYBqApXI_DhGaNs7EubmlRwKMclomXZ3k8bPzgNLuJbKf4mbfDXiZ67cRN-HhrKy0zucwFsLdapBj1CcjvN9zcQL6RVxrOXOtRzgN4yp2YODVsSWOlFHceeLx6dK2I-FhXsV4drGC2S29FobIBge5v5CroGtKiKRoUXXETAK6RUQ6MOcV6Z49I7Uny932z6BC0)), helping users understand a product\u2019s ratings at a quick glance. This could be supplemented with a  **QR code**  system (like the [SmartLabel](https://www.pkgbranding.com/blog/what-cpg-brands-need-to-know-about-the-smartlabel) initiative), which would allow users to seek out more granular information about a product. Adding a QR code and online repository would have the added benefit of accounting for the fact that digital products update regularly and can change significantly over their lifecycle.\n\nAnother major challenge would be  **how to govern**  the trustmark and assess whether participating companies meet the criteria, and whether these criteria should be supported through legislation outlining minimum standards. For any digital trustmark to be effective and meaningful, it has to also be recognised widely and perceived as legitimate and trustworthy. Ideally, then, the trustmark would be initiated and overseen by a large, transnational and publicly accountable organisation with enough capacity, resources and legitimacy, and its success will depend on adequate investment for development and publicity.\n\n## So is it worth it?\n\nDeveloping a successful trustmark for the internet would be a highly challenging and ambitious project. So much so, that some experts have [argued that it is not worth pursuing](https://www.doteveryone.org.uk/2019/09/digital-products-and-services-arent-bananas/), and that instead we should focus on helping tech companies operate more responsibly.\n\nYet, the potential value of a comprehensive trustmark - to inform and empower consumers, drive competition and nudge businesses to do the right thing - should not be underestimated. In light of growing consumer distrust in technology, we believe  **Europe should seize the initiative and first-mover advantage by developing a shared digital trustmark**  to inform citizens which internet products and services operate responsibly and employ industry best practices.\n\nOf course, this work should be undertaken through  **consultation with all relevant stakeholders**  - including national governments, independent regulators, companies and civil society. It can also  **build on existing efforts** , some examples of which we outline in our full report. Some potential areas of focus that we have identified include:  **cyber security, privacy and data practices, transparency, bias and inclusive representation, and accountability** .\n\nIn light of the European Commission\u2019s recently announced Green Deal, we also believe that a digital trustmark can be a meaningful tool to address the  **sustainability and environmental impact**  of the internet, from energy-intensive video streaming and cloud services to hard-to-repair smartphones.

Just saying: please define a formal JSON schema, it really makes life easier. You'd then also use a validator for that schema, which for Vue.js will probably be [vue-vuelidate-jsonschema](https://github.com/mokkabonna/vue-vuelidate-jsonschema).\n\n[quote=\"owen, post:7, topic:12063\"]Standardise Discourse post structure for events, stories, bios, calls, campaigns[/quote]\n\nI have been toying around ([here](/t/11338/2)) with the idea of providing structured data in Discourse posts as JSON embedded inside Discourse posts as code sections. That would address most of your question (for bios, calls, campaigns) except for \"content types\" that we expect \"normal users\" to contribute (events, stories), which would require plugin-provided custom fields in Discourse to ensure nothing can be entered the wrong way.\n\nNow for this \"JSON in Discourse posts\" idea I discovered that editing and viewing JSON in Discourse code sections is cumbersome. [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) seems much better for this application, as it allows multi-line strings, comments etc.. I'd like to strongly encourage @owen to evaluate if YAML is a good data standard for the modular web kit as a whole, and if so, to use it for that. It's just a superset of JSON anyway \u2013 so even if we don't evaluate this now, I might still introduce it as our standard data exchange format later anyway (in case it's a matter of funding / resources at the moment). Just as a warning that I have this in mind :) \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd @felix.wolfsteller: I share your points about Vue.js web applications. However the larger concern for me is to fracture the Edgeryders-wide IT landscape as little as possible. If we *require* Vue.js capabilities for *some* websites, it's better to use it as the standard for all websites, due to skill reuse, learning curve, server admin effort etc.. I propose we will not use Nuxt.js again: it may be able to generate static sites, but otherwise is just another JS framework, largely adding just redundant complexity. If we were to add a static website generator for websites fed from a Discourse forum in some ways, I'd rather go for something close to the Discourse ecosystem: based on a static website generator written in Ruby. Because that makes it more useful for others who have a similar need for a website associated to a Discourse forum. We did some initial work on this concept [here](https://github.com/edgeryders/websites-from-discourse), and it's feeding three of our websites so far.

Neki se problemi mo\u017eda i re\u0161e, ali se novi, mo\u017eda zna\u010dajniji, tek otvaraju. Kada ve\u0107 govorimo o zdravstvenoj i socijalnoj za\u0161titi kao osnovama kvalitetnog \u017eivota sveke gra\u0111anke i svakog gra\u0111anina, \u010dini mi se da delimo probleme. Samo je Hrvatska mo\u017eda i tu oti\u0161la korak dalje, odnosno u te\u017ee i ve\u0107e probleme. U Srbiji je izra\u017een trend odlaska medicinskih sestara i lekara u zemlje  EU, ali imamo \"sre\u0107u\" da jo\u0161 imamo veliki broj tih ljudi koji do sada nisu ni u Srbiji mogli da prona\u0111u posao, pa ima ko da popuni ta mesta koja ostaju prazna. Medicinsko osoblje iz Hrvatske u\u017eiva sva prava na mobilnost unutar EU, pa mi se \u010dini da je tamo problem odlaska jo\u0161 izra\u017eeniji. Dodatno, problem je \u0161to oni kojima smo se nekad tako ponosili, oni koji su bili najbolji, najstru\u010dniji, a uz to i najsavesniji, najmanje skloni korupciji - logi\u010dno odlaze prvi.\nSaglasan sam sa tobom da deo problema le\u017ei u tome \u0161to u obe zemlje na vlasti imamo one koji su te zemlje vodili i tokom ratova devedesetih. One koji su deklarativno naklonjeni nekakvim evropskim vrednostima, a neprekidno koketiraju sa nacionalizmom i njegovim najgorim pojavnim oblicima poput usta\u0161tva i \u010detni\u0161tva. Da li smo se trajno zaglavili u toj populisti\u010dkoj spirali, to je ono \u0161to ne znam. No \u010dini mi se da \u0107emo jo\u0161 neko vreme biti u tome, jer u regionu ne vidim politi\u010dare koji bi kvalitet \u017eivota gra\u0111ana stavili ispred pitanja koja se tako lako lepe za svest bira\u010da - naciju, veru i ugro\u017eenost istih od strane nekih drugih i druga\u010dijih.

Smart Cities, where the digital and physical meet and where algorithms actively impact our daily lives, is an important focal point of his work.\n\nHe proposes reframing the Smart City discourse (currently dominated by vendors of Smart City tech) away from the technology and more towards a focus on societal impact. What better urban metrics can we apply to cities increasingly governed or shaped by algorithms? Such an analytical framework would be the key to unlocking a real, meaningful debate. Smart City policies must be built around citizen/digital, human rights, and with emphasis on participatory processes, transparency and accountability.\n\nAt the most recent ThingsCon conference, Manon den Dunnen shared her experience of unintended horrific consequences of tech going wrong when police officers take phone numbers of both victims and suspects, and then Facebook algorithms then suggest one another as friends.\n\nFurther, several studies have shown policing and/or justice related algorithms were found to have racist data points (including some deemed illegal by courts yet remained in the data sets). And the policing algorithm in NYC measures effectiveness by such simplistic metrics that created incentive for officers to report selectively (for example, the systemic intimidation of rape victims to change their charge from rape to a more minor offence).\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Peter here:**  [How can we put humans/citizens first in our smart city policies?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-can-we-put-humans-citizens-first-in-our-smart-city-policies/9878/40)\n\n*Join our Workshop on Inequalities in the age of AI, what they are, how they work and what we can do about them.

STSMs are intended especially, but not solely, for young researchers.\n\n \n\nAn STSM should specifically contribute to the scientific objectives of the COST Action \u201cSharing And Caring\u201d, while enabling those partaking in the missions to establish new partnerships, learn new techniques, gain access to specific data, instruments and / or methods not available in their own institutions / organisations.\n\n \n\n**Who can apply?**\n\n \n\nSTSMs are open for PhDs, PostDocs, and advanced career researchers employed at institutions in countries participating in \u201cSharing AndCaring\u201d, or at approved institutions. STSMs must be performed between COST countries - researchers cannot apply for an STSM within their own country.\n\n \n\nPriority will be given to Early Career Investigators (ECI) (maximum 8 years since obtaining their PhD at the time of application) and PhD students working on socio-technical aspects of the collaborative economy.\n\n \n\nParticular consideration will also be given to candidates moving from/to COST Inclusiveness Target Countries (ITCs), which include Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Croatia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Montenegro, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Republic of Serbia and Turkey.\n\n \n\nInternational COST participants may host STSM researchers from European COST countries but may not apply for STSMs themselves.\n\n \n\nAwards throughout the annual grant period (for the third year: 1st May 2019- 30th April 2020) will be made to support scientific excellence, and to support a variety of researchers in terms of gender, career stage, affiliation, and nationality.\n\n \n\n**What can you apply for?**\n\n \n\nYou can apply for a short term scientific mission of the duration between 5 and 90 days (and up to 180 days if the applicant is an ECI) to take place before April 30th 2020. The STSM will be a fixed grant to cover part of the travel expenses and living allowance. The cost of research materials is not eligible for consideration as part of the grant.\n\n \n\nPlease note that the awarded grant will be paid only after the STSM has been completed \u2013 therefore the applicant must have approval and prior financial support e.g., from their own institution.\n\nThe following funding conditions apply and must be respected:\n\n\u25cf      up to a max of EUR2500 in total can be afforded to each successful STSM applicant;\n\n\u25cf      up to a max of EUR160 per day can be afforded for accommodation &amp; meal expenses;\n\n\u25cf      for ECIs, a max amount of EUR3500 can be afforded to the Grantee for STSMs with a duration of between 91 &amp; 180 days \u2013 For ECIs partaking in STSMs with a duration of between 5 &amp; 90 days, the limit is EUR2500; STSM activities must occur in their entirety within the dates specified in this call.\n\nSTSM awards may be combined with other funding sources, but these must be acknowledged in the application.\n\nIn your application, you will have to describe the goal of the proposed STSM, how it contributes to the scientific remit of the COST Action \u201cSharing And Caring\u201d, the planned expenses and the outputs planned as result of the STSM. For ECIs, two support letters by advanced career researchers will be required.\n\nFor detailed rules regarding eligibility and financial support, please see the relevant sections of the COST Vademecum ([ *http://www.cost.eu/download/COSTVademecum* ](http://www.cost.eu/download/COSTVademecum) *)* .\n\n**When can you apply?**\n\nYou can apply until Midnight (Brussels Time) on the 25th of November 2019.\n\n  \n\n**How can you apply?**\n\n \n\nThis is a step-by-step guide to applying for an STSM and the criteria by which STSM applications will be assessed. More in-depth information can be found at the COST Vademecum ([ *http://www.cost.eu/download/COSTVademecum* ](http://www.cost.eu/download/COSTVademecum) *)* . Please contact Prof Luigina Ciolfi (STSM coordinator) ([l.ciolfi@shu.ac.uk](mailto:l.ciolfi@shu.ac.uk)) if you have any queries.\n\n \n\nThe application process is as follows:\n\n1. Applicants must carefully read the funding rules detailed in Section 7 of the  *COST*  H2020  *Vademecum, Section 7 (* [ *http://www.cost.eu/download/COSTVademecum* ](http://www.cost.eu/download/COSTVademecum) *)*\n\n2. Applicants must submit an application using e-COST https://e-services.cost.eu/user/login/STSM. If you do not already have an e-COST account you will first need to 'create an account' - which will include providing the details of the bank account where the grant will be lodged if your STSM application is approved and the STSM successfully completed.\n\n3.

(You may still know it by its preliminary name Economy App.)\n\n<strong>\u201cYour moneyless marketplace.\u201d</strong>\n\nMakerfox is a moneyless marketplace focusing on the maker / hacker / DIY / entrepreneurial economy. It uses a novel web-based software to run an economy on a modern, computerized form of barter, and is meant especially for areas where big numbers of people are economically excluded (\"jobless\") even though they have skills, time and needs. Just that there are no jobs for them in the traditional, formal economy. The software needs users to have an Internet connection, though. Still, that makes it applicable for Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, several Northern African and Latin American countries.\n\nHow does it work? Makerfox wants to fix unemployment by enabling economic exchange without cash or credit money. For this, we developed a novel, computer-calculated multi-party form of barter which we call \"network barter\". We don't even try to hide this innovation since we believe it will be of much bigger use than we can find for it with our moneyless marketplace platform. So <a href=\"http://edgeryders.eu/economy-app/breakthrough-in-algorithm-development\">here's how we do it</a>, plus when the user community has matured we will release the actual core algorithm doing these calculations as free and open source software (AGPL v3 licenced).\n\nFor its potential to generate jobs in Europe's current difficult economic situation, it was awarded the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/policy/social-innovation/profiles/index_en.htm\">European Social Innovation Award 2013</a> and received funding from the European Commission.\n\nWe did much simulation over the last weeks; our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matjahu/status/440854308192395265\">biggest simulated barter trade</a> had 100 participants and 10 000 EUR turnover. We then moved to letting the software do real-world deals, starting small again with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matjahu/status/444271237259206656\">a first trade from 2014-03-13</a>, including 3 users,100 EUR turnover and a lot of bugs that we're fixing now :P\n\n<strong>State of the Art: We are in public beta test now! <a href=\"http://www.makerfox.com/\">Register at makerfox.com</a> to become an early adopter and influence our development path with your feedback!</strong> All your offers and orders are live, so you might as well become part of the world's first network barter deals :)", "created_at": "2013-01-29 15:02:58", "updated_at": "2017-10-03 11:06:51.259224", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 419, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 25.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64914, "user_id": 5025, "topic_id": 9881, "post_number": 105, "raw": "Hello!\n\nI'm super excited to soon meet you all to have this workshop going.

The question is generic: there is an emerging approach to care (health/social/active aging related) that I call \"care by artifacts\". An elderly person, for example, can be fitted with accelerometers, location and motion sensors so that, if she falls in the shower, some control center will receive an alert. Business is embracing the Internet of Things in this area.\n\nProblems:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>you end up \"running Windows in your body\" \u2013 proprietary software controls the care you receive. And since you don't know (and can't know) how it works, you probably don't want to be entrusting it your physical and mental well-being.</li>\n\n<li>business models in IoT-powered care point towards chronicization. If you heal, or become autonomous, you stop paying the provider. This is bad for business and can't be allowed. So, the proprietary IoT in care points towards a world in which you have to pay to be well.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nSolution (?):\n\nMove from \"care by artifacts\" to \"care by skilled communities\". When artifacts are needed, they will be produced and maintained: the community has a large enough knowledge pool that \"it can work on almost anything\", as you say. For this to work, all soft and hard artifacts are to be open.\n\nOur idea is that this approach will be discussed, and some specific problems will be selected. At this point, we will prototype solutions to the specific problems. But this does not happen until we have had a chance to have that conversation.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-24 08:21:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.457633", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 275, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22781], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33729, "user_id": 3596, "topic_id": 6578, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Il tuo progetto in un tweet*</strong>\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\tDoc.doc \u00e8 la soluzione per mettere in contatto medici che seguono lo stesso paziente, fornendo loro la panoramica pi\u00f9 completa possibile.</li>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Bisogno o problema che il tuo progetto cerca di risolvere*\u00a0</strong>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSempre di pi\u00f9 patologie complesse necessitano della collaborazione tra molti specialisti della cura.\n\nA questi diversi professionisti manca per\u00f2 la possibilit\u00e0 di comunicare e condividere informazioni su una piattaforma dedicata.\n\nL\u2019attuale procedura di lavoro evidenzia i seguenti problemi:\n\n1.

Attraverso un processo di ricerca abbiamo evidenziato come un approccio olistico, che a colpo d\u2019occhio fornisca un quadro clinico completo, comporterebbe indubbi vantaggi a medici e pazienti.\n\n1.2 Acquisizione di idee, spunti, intuizioni\n\nLo spunto iniziale che ha dato l\u2019avvio al progetto \u00e8 scaturito da una serie di interviste condotte tra medici e pazienti. Questi ultimi in particolare lamentavano la scarsa preparazione del medico rispetto al loro specifico caso clinico, delegando pertanto al paziente stesso, la responsabilit\u00e0 nel fornire informazioni dettagliate circa la patologia da affrontare.\n\n1.3 Definizione del problema\n\nIl problema che abbiamo affrontato pu\u00f2 essere definito come una carenza di comunicazione. I diversi professionisti della cura non possiedono, ad oggi, uno strumento semplice e veloce che possa tenerli aggiornati rispetto alla progressione clinica di ogni loro paziente. Le informazioni sanitarie sono disgregate e appartengono allo specialista che le ha prodotte attraverso la propria visita. Queste informazioni tendenzialmente non hanno altro modo di essere condivise, se non attraverso il paziente stesso, cui si delega il compito e la responsabilit\u00e0 di fornire tali informazioni allo specialista successivo.\n\nDoc.doc si propone essenzialmente come un aggregatore di informazioni, un unico database medico nel quale possano essere convogliati e organizzati i dati dei pazienti che si hanno in cura. In questo modo il medico pu\u00f2 affrontare ogni nuova visita avendo gi\u00e0 chiara l\u2019anamnesi pregressa del paziente in questione. Doc.doc inoltre fornisce tutti i contatti degli specialisti che hanno condotto una determinata visita in precedenza, e rende estremamente semplice (un clic) la possibilit\u00e0 di mettersi in contatto con un collega per richiedere un chiarimento o un parere rispetto ai dettagli di una certa una cartella clinica.\n\n<strong>2.0 Definizione</strong>\n\n2.1 Analisi delle soluzioni\n\nIn seguito ad una estesa sessione di una particolare forma di brainstorming, il brainwriting, sono stati vagliati diversi possibili approcci per affrontare il tema proposto dal bando OpenCare. Questi sono stati categorizzati in modo sistematico secondo la tecnica detta delle 4Cs (le quattro\u201dc\u201d: components, characteristics, challenges, characters) e quindi circoscritti in macro-aree che puntavano ad un certo specifico orientamento verso la risoluzione delle problematiche riscontrate in ambito sanitario.\n\n2.2 Ideazione del concept\n\nIn seguito ai risultati scaturiti dalle tecniche di brainstorming, \u00e8 stato realizzato un questionario da sottoporre ad un certo numero di pazienti, parenti dei pazienti e professionisti della cura (non solo medici, ma anche infermieri, farmacisti, fisioterapisti etc\u2026).\n\nQueste interviste si sono rivelate cruciali nel definire il percorso che doc.doc avrebbe intrapreso.\n\nInfatti, abbiamo riscontrato presso la maggior parte dei pazienti intervistati, una sostanziale insoddisfazione riguardo i processi di comunicazione con i propri medici. In particolare, nel caso di patologie particolarmente complesse, dove \u00e8 necessario il coinvolgimento di molteplici specialisti, spesso i medici coinvolti sono parzialmente o totalmente all\u2019oscuro riguardo i progressi dei colleghi nei confronti di uno specifico aspetto nella cura della patologia. La comunicazione di queste informazioni, avviene, ma quasi esclusivamente per mezzo del paziente, il quale \u00e8 costretto ad assumersi la piena responsabilit\u00e0 dell\u2019accuratezza e completezza delle informazioni fornite.\n\n2.3 Proposta della soluzione\n\nIn seguito alla ricerca svolta, \u00e8 stato quindi logico cominciare a pensare alla progettazione di uno strumento gestionale che permettesse ai medici di avere immediatamente disponibili tutte le informazioni concernente un certo paziente, comprese le informazioni di contatto dei colleghi responsabili di una certa visita.\n\nAbbiamo cos\u00ec progettato uno strumento gestionale che facilita l\u2019organizzazione degli appuntamenti di un medico, ordina in maniera chiara le cartelle cliniche dei pazienti per tipologia e cronologia, permette in un clic di contattare un collega tramite telefono, chat o email, infine rende pi\u00f9 efficiente la visita stessa poich\u00e9 doc.doc consente al medico curante di aggiornarsi circa i progressi del proprio paziente nei minuti precedenti alla visita.\n\nDoc.doc infatti pu\u00f2 essere programmato per concedere uno spazio di tempo (tendenzialmente 10 minuti) tra una visita e l\u2019altra, che permetta al medico di prendere visione della cartella clinica del paziente che sta per incontrare.\n\n<strong>3.0 Sviluppo</strong>\n\n3.1 Progettazione e prova del prototipo\n\nDoc.doc allo stato attuale consiste in un prototipo interattivo realizzato attraverso la piattaforma proto.io.\n\nPrima di ottenere questo risultato abbiamo sostenuto una approfondita analisi UX che ci ha consentito di effettuare scelte precise circa lo sviluppo di certe funzionalit\u00e0.\u00a0In particolare, attraverso tecniche di Brainwriting e alcune empathy map abbiamo circoscritto l\u2019ambito di lavoro.\n\nA seguito di alcune interviste di orientamento con pazienti e professionisti sanitari abbiamo definito ulteriormente gli obiettivi del progetto, concentrandoci su una \u201cone primary task\u201d, che nel caso di doc.doc consiste nell\u2019aggregazione semplificata dei dati di ogni paziente. Considerando quindi alcuni ipotetici scenari di utilizzo del nostro servizio (presso specialisti\u00a0o medici di base, in studio o in visita a domicilio etc\u2026) abbiamo sviluppato una prima logica di user flow e infine la sua realizzazione grafica interattiva, della quale si pu\u00f2 avere una tangibile esperienza d\u2019uso qui: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2oOXbmK\">http://bit.ly/2oOXbmK</a> (una volta scaricata l'intera\u00a0cartella \u00e8 sufficiente aprire il file index.html con il proprio browser, meglio se Chrome).\n\nInoltre in seguito allo sviluppo del prototipo \u00e8 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing\u00a0che ha evidenziato piccole problematiche, immediatamente risolte con il rilascio della versione successiva, di cui si pu\u00f2 prendere visione al link sopracitato.\n\n3.2\u00a0Prova della fruibilit\u00e0\n\nE\u2019 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing, parzialmente moderato, che ha sostanzialmente confermato tutti gli obiettivi di usabilit\u00e0 stabiliti a monte. In particolare i nostri utenti test sono stati, per la maggior parte, in grado di portare a termine le operazioni richieste, quali: 1. Consultare una cartella clinica, 2. Consultare la rubrica pazienti e professionisti, 3. Aggiungere un nuovo appuntamento, 4. Contattare un collega. In questa fase abbiamo ritenuto prematuro considerare ulteriore metriche di controllo oggettive quali tempi e statistiche di errore, concentrandoci piuttosto su misurazioni di gradimento soggettive e mantenendo come unico conteggio obiettivo il numero di operazioni portate a buon fine.\n\nSono stati riscontrati alcuni problemi nella fruibilit\u00e0 dei dati della cartella clinica e delle funzionalit\u00e0 ad essa collegate (\u00e8 infatti possibile anche iniziare una conversazione\u00a0con un collega). L\u2019organizzazione dei contenuti di quella determinata schermata \u00e8 stata quindi modificata sulla base dei feedback ricevuti, cos\u00ec come l\u2019intero look&amp;feel dell\u2019applicazione \u00e8 stato rivisto coerentemente rispetto alle modifiche apportate.\n\n<strong>4.0 Rilascio</strong>\n\n4.1 Completamento del prodotto/servizio\n\nIl prototipo \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato testato, ma andrebbe ulteriormente verificato su un campione pi\u00f9 esteso di utenti, seguito eventualmente da un A/B testing.\n\nConclusa la fase di usability testing sul prototipo, si proceder\u00e0 quindi con lo sviluppo di programmazione vero e proprio, la\u00a0cui funzionalit\u00e0\u00a0verr\u00e0\u00a0verificata\u00a0ad ogni milestone raggiunta.\n\nInfine, verranno concepite strategie di distribuzione, idealmente con il coinvolgimento delle ASL locali, per permettere un capillare ed effettivo utilizzo del servizio.\n\n4.2 Rilascio finale\n\nE\u2019 in fase di definizione una timeline di sviluppo che presenti le milestone necessarie al completamento del prodotto, secondo specifiche tempistiche.\n\n4.3 Produzione\n\nIl team di sviluppo tecnico \u00e8 ancora da definirsi, ma stiamo valutando una collaborazione con I-SEE\u00a0(http://www.i-seecomputing.com), specialisti nell produzione di software in ambito medico/ sanitario.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-03 14:39:04", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 03:20:47.890820", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2167, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 16.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65028, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11690, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Welcome Alex!\n\nPing @zelf", "created_at": "2019-11-21 16:37:25.702510", "updated_at": "2019-11-21 16:37:25.702510", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33727, "user_id": 3069, "topic_id": 6576, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>Where:</span>\n\n<span>USA (and everywhere in the world)</span>\n\n<span>When:</span>\n\n<span>2014</span>\n\n<span>Who:</span>\n\n<span>Group of parents with diabetic children</span>\n\n<span>Few lines description:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span>Is it a device / software / service</span>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>NightScout is a software that allows users\u2019 to have on time visibility of glucose levels of people suffering from diabetes type 1</span><span>.</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span>Type of community involved (elders, deaf/blind/autism\u2026 disability, etc)</span>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>The project started from parents of children with Diabetes type 1, in order to fulfill the need of allowing the to leave a normal life without the necessity of being continuously together to check the glucose levels.

I grew up in a tight-knit community of other first gen/immigrant kids in the USA. And my dad also did research at IBM and a university ;) Being in the USA after 9/11 created a similar kind of hostile environment for our Arab family. \n\nThe problem with this notion of 'creating identity' for yourself is that, as @nadia alludes to, you can't always choose your tribe or territory, especially when those around you reject your attempts to belong.  \n\nI think the most interesting thing that I've found is the people I end up relating to most aren't those that share one of my ethnic backgrounds, but other hyphenated people. Most of my friends are first-generation and/or mixed. And they understand an identity formed both through presence and absence -- of 'homeland', of family ties, of belonging. So I get the 'nomadic ties' thing, but I think it has more teeth than just collecting people and places you like-- sometimes, you don't have an entry ticket. Or you get in and find you only have partial access. And some identities you can't just shed, unless you want to change your name and your skin.\n\nDiasporic identity is always complicated -- and in the Palestinian case, 'communities of fate' is an apt phrase. One of my favourite poets, Mahmoud Darwish, writes on it a lot. He wrote a poem about talking with Edward Said that speaks a lot to the questions we're discussing here -- it's a conversation between the two of them about identity. Said thinks you can make your own identity out of two worlds (more free form) and Darwish sees deeper ties that bind and hold us, whether we like it or not (you can see this in his other poems). The important thing to note is that both of them articulate what @nadia is talking about in terms of an emplaced identity tied to justice and tied to conflict. Both Said and Darwish, in their other works, ask questions about how identity can inform what we fight for, and how displacement affects the things we care about and the way we imagine the communities that share our struggle. Palestinian diasporic identity sheds a lot of light on this issue, since a lot of other Arab communities have turned their back on the Palestinian struggle, or only support it in name. And diasporic Palestinians outside of the MENA have a different lived experience than those exiled in other MENA countries, or those in refugee camps, or those still living in Palestine under occupation. Where we are located changes the ways we figure and conceptualise justice and struggle; affects the energies we have to struggle; and shapes what kinds of futures are imaginable. It's too long to paste the whole poem, but here are some excerpts:\n\nNew York / November / Fifth Avenue...\nThere, on the doorstep of an electric abyss,\nhigh as the sky, I met Edward,\nthirty years ago,\ntime was less wild then . . .\nWe both said:\nIf the past is only an experience,\nmake of the future a meaning and a vision.\nLet us go,\nLet us go into tomorrow trusting\nthe candor of imagination and the miracle of grass/\n* * *\nNew York. Edward wakes up to\na lazy dawn. He plays\nMozart.\nRuns round the university's tennis\ncourt.\nThinks of the journey of ideas across\nborders,\nand over barriers. He reads the New York Times.\nfirites out his furious comments. Curses an Orientalist\nguiding the General to the weak point\ninside the heart of an Oriental woman. He showers. Chooses\nhis elegant suit. Drinks\nhis white coffee. Shouts at the dawn:\nDo not loiter.\n* * *\nOn wind he walks, and in wind\nhe knows himself. There is no ceiling for the wind,\nno home for the wind. Wind is the compass\nof the stranger's North.\nHe says: I am from there, I am from here,\nbut I am neither there nor here. \nI have two names which meet and part . . .\nI have two languages, but I have long forgotten\nwhich is the language of my dreams.\nI have an English language, for writing,\nwith yielding phrases,\nand a language in which Heaven and\nJerusalem converse, with a silver cadence,\nbut it does not yield to my imagination.\n* * *\nWhat about identity? I asked.\nHe said: It's self-defense . . .\nIdentity is the child of birth, but\nat the end, it's self-invention, and not\nan inheritance of the past. I am multiple . . .\nWithin me an ever new exterior. And\nI belong to the question of the victim. Were I not\nfrom there, I would have trained my heart\nto nurture there deer of metaphor . . .\nSo carry your homeland wherever you go, and be\na narcissist if need be/\nThe outside world is exile,\nexile is the world inside.\nAnd what are you between the two?\n* * *\nMyself, I do not know\nso that I shall not lose it. I am what I am.\nI am my other, a duality\ngaining resonance in between speech and gesture.\nWere I to write poetry I would have said:\nI am two in one,\nlike the wings of a swallow,\ncontent with bringing good omen\nwhen spring is late.\n* * *\nHe loves a country and he leaves.\n[Is the impossible far off?]\nHe loves leaving to things unknown. \nBy traveling freely across cultures\nthose in search of the human essence\nmay find a space for all to sit . . .\nHere a margin advances. Or a center\nretreats. Where East is not strictly east,\nand West is not strictly west,\nwhere identity is open onto plurality,\nnot a fort or a trench/\n* * *\nHe loves a country and he leaves:\nI am what I am and shall be.\nI shall choose my place by myself,\nand choose my exile.

I tried\nto recall my birth, and\nto watch the Milky Way from the roof of my old\nhouse. I tried to stroke the skin\nof absence and the smell of summer\nin the garden's jasmine. But the hyena that is truth\ndrove me away from a thief-like\nnostalgia.\n\u2014Were you afraid? What frightened you?\nI could not meet loss face\nto face. I stood by the door like a beggar.\nHow could I ask permission from strangers sleeping\nin my own bed . . . Ask them if I could visit myself\nfor five minutes? Should I bow in respect\nto the residents of my childish dream? Would they ask:\nWho is that prying foreign visitor? And how\ncould I talk about war and peace\namong the victims and the victims' victims,\nwithout additions, without an interjection?\nAnd would they tell me: There is no place for two dreams\nin one bedroom?\n* * *\nIt is neither me nor him\nwho asks; it is a reader asking:\nWhat can poetry say in a time of catastrophe?\n* * *\nBlood\nand blood,\nblood\nin your country, \nin my name and in yours, in\nthe almond flower, in the banana skin,\nin the baby's milk, in light and shadow,\nin the grain of wheat, in salt/\n* * *\nAdept snipers, hitting their target\nwith maximum proficiency.\nBlood\nand blood\nand blood.\nThis land is smaller than the blood of its children\nstanding on the threshold of doomsday like\nsacrificial offerings.

G\u00fcrses\n> With an undergrad degree in international relations and mathematics, [@sedyst](https://edgeryders.eu/u/sedyst) is now an academic at Delft University, focussing on how to do computer science differently - utilising\n\n> an\n\n> interdisciplinary approach to explore both concepts of privacy and surveillance, and also looking at what communities need\n\nin face of increasing use of AI, or what she calls logics of optimization in digital systems.\n> . They were led into this field of study by their fascination with the politics of mathematics and the biases contained within seemingly neutral numbers.\n\n> The technological landscape has changed enormously in the past few years \u2014 from static software saved on a disk that was only updated every once in a while, to software and apps that are held on services and so constantly updated and optimised.\n\nIn addition to existing concerns around privacy and security, a whole host of new harms and risks have arisen that requires the attention of computer scientists to find other ways of securing and protecting users, non-users and their environments.\n> The negative consequences of prioritising optimisation over user experience can be seen in Google\n\nTraffic\n> and\n\nWaze\n\n> , which\n\n> send users down\n\nsurface\n> roads to avoid freeway traffic. They don\u2019t care that this\n\nmay have\n> an adverse impact on the environment and local communities, or even that it actually\n\nmay increase congestion over all\n> . Further, Uber has optimised its system to outsource risk to its workers: instead of paying people for the time they work, Uber offers them a system that tells them when they are most likely to get customers,\n\ncasting ``labor optimization'' as paying people only for when they pick up a customer, and externalizing all further risks associated with the job, e.g., waiting time, sick leave, accidents, onto drivers.\n> \n\n> When this kind of tech injustice is applied to public institutions such as borders and social welfare systems, the\n\noptimization logic and injustices\n> embedded in the very systems\n\n> means\n\n> we are changing the fabric of society without having the necessary discussions as to whether that\u2019s something we want to do. We need to stop\n\nfocusing so much on\n> data and algorithms and\n\npay much more attention to\n> the forms of\n\ngovernance\n> we want these technologies to have.

We need to try to define the term &ldquo;DEEP GREEN TECH&rdquo; with some concrete examples, with terms that do not require absolute expertise in specific fields to enable proper cross discipline discussion and face the issue of how to deal with the underlying tension between acknowledging the ecological costs of the tech industry and findings ways to develop technological tools to protect the climate.**\n\n[quote=&quot;amelia, post:1, topic:11325&quot;]\n\nSeveral current threads revolve around the notion of Deep Green Tech. While there is a lot of interesting discussion around this concept, it has yet to be clearly defined by the community. From what we can gather so far, Deep Green Tech is similar to Deep Tech, describing mainly startup companies based on substantial scientific research and innovations in tech engineering. Deep Green Tech, broadly, seems to describe technology that is ecologically sustainable, innovative and based on scientific advancements. The concept of Deep Green Tech appears to be a central area of focus for the NGI Forward community, but there seems to be ongoing discussions to clarify confusion around the term&rsquo;s definition, its ramifications and implications. As a result, we want to help cut through the opacity of these discussions by working with you to understand how you define the term while also asking you to give concrete examples of its application, e.g. in design, research, tech innovation etc. In this way, we think we might all move toward a deeper and more productive discussion of the futures we want to see.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=&quot;amelia, post:1, topic:11325&quot;]\n\nInterestingly (and perhaps conversely), explorations of the relationship between the climate and the internet/tech appears to be in its infancy, and though we are working with a community of experts, there often seems to be a struggle to solidly define key terms and concepts. Despite expertise, or perhaps because of it, specificity in defining technologies and technological areas requiring increased research focus persists across stories, meaning that you might find defining targeted and specific problems around these areas difficult as well. Also of interest, many of you find an underlying tension between acknowledging the ecological costs of the tech industry and findings ways to develop technological tools to protect the climate.\n\n[/quote]\n\n**2. We need to include more of our personal experience, motivations and examples in our stories, thoughts, ideas and project presentations and discussions. Your views on the topic are surely interesting, but knowing what brought you to start thinking about it and what shaped your ideas is what will enable us to not only connect but also to discuss and research on a deeper level!**\n\n[quote=&quot;amelia, post:1, topic:11325&quot;]\n\nInterestingly (and perhaps conversely), explorations of the relationship between the climate and the internet/tech appear to be in its infancy, and though we are working with a community of experts, there often seems to be a struggle to solidly define key terms and concepts.

Listing all the self-hostable solutions is not feasible if not done proper itself (collaborative, versioned, and \"exact\" - which is difficult - you *can* sell and use libreoffice as a book-keeping application if done right).\n\nWill get a bit technical now:\n\n**Nextcloud**\nAs an nextcloud and CODE/Collabora user I can say that I am pretty happy with it. Also, e.g. the [austrian habitat uses it with kind of SSO](https://github.com/soudis/habidat-user) (Single Sign On) and central user authorization, with integrated discourse and dokuwiki. The setup and deployment is not real fun yet, though. Btw latest nextcloud allows definitions of templates (regarding the discussion on iron conventions), but these pop up only if the web-editor is used of course\n\nThe nextcloud WebDAV does work in principle, but is not really feasible if you have a small or un-tuned server, big amounts of files and users or old Linux clients (until Ubuntu 16.04 I stumbled upon some serious bugs and sometimes horrible performance in the evaluated implementations). I would assume that the LibreOffice file locking mechanism works fine with WebDAV if the remote \"directory\" is mounted. But LibreOffice comes with a webdav-implementation itself - if I am not mistaken - so it probably uses different access and locking mechanisms depending how it identifies the underlying filesystem (which could be a remote webdav).\n\n**(online!) Time-Tracking**\nDepends on whether you want time tracking or project management with timetracking. Personally, I use [redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) for the later but with its bureaucratic overhead its not a solution that will work for everybody. In the community we use the [anuko time tracker](https://www.anuko.com/time_tracker/), which is probably \"as modern as redmine\" (both tool really do not have the trello feel), but does its job really well.

A vase? A flowerpot? \u2026 an air-conditioning unit? Believe it or not, you can. When inventor Ashis Paul came up with an innovative way to draw cool air into homes using plastic bottles, his whole company got on board to help teach people living in rural Bangledesh to do the same. Since February this year, they\u2019ve helped people to install these units-- which don\u2019t need electricity to function-- in more than 25,000 households in developing areas of the country.\n\n\u201cMost people live in tin huts\u2026 in the summer, it\u2019s like being in sauna in the Sahara\u201d\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://observers.france24.com/en/contributor/jaiyyan-huq\" title=\"Jaiyyanul Huq\"><img alt=\"Jaiyyanul Huq\" src=\"https://d1lqe9temigv1p.cloudfront.net/img/9d4c6a56fa88f1b53ab681a4f8e03639277825cd.jpg\"></a></figure>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://observers.france24.com/en/contributor/jaiyyan-huq\">Jaiyyanul Huq</a></h4>\n\nJaiyyanul Huq is a creative director with the Grey Group, the advertising company that spearheaded <a href=\"http://grey.com/apac/work/key/eco-cooler/id/12475/\" target=\"_blank\">this social project</a>.\n\n<blockquote>We are a flood-prone nation, so in rural Bangladesh, most people build their homes out of tin, instead of mud. About 70% of Bangladesh's population lives in these homes. But the problem with these tin huts is that they get unbearably hot in the summer, especially in northern and central Bangladesh. I\u2019ve been in these huts. It\u2019s like being in a sauna in the Sahara. \n\nOne of our creative supervisors, Ashis Paul, started thinking about ways to bring relief to these people. He was turning it over in his mind when one day, he overheard his daughter\u2019s physics tutor explaining to her how gas cools when it expands quickly. Ashis has an \"inventor\" mentality and he\u2019s always been fascinated by science. So, he started experimenting. \n\nHe told us about his idea of making an air-conditioner out of plastic bottles. The simplicity of the Eco-Cooler is incredible. </blockquote>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://scd.observers.france24.com/files/imagecache/observers_full_width/rfi_multimedia_element_image/ashis.paul_.jpg\">\n\n<figcaption> </figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nAshis Paul designed the Eco cooler. \n\nHow to Make an Eco-Cooler \n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://scd.observers.france24.com/files/imagecache/observers_full_width/rfi_multimedia_element_image/eco-cooler.04.jpg\">\n\n<figcaption> </figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nTo make an Eco-Cooler, you cut plastic bottles in half and then mount them on a board. \n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://scd.observers.france24.com/files/imagecache/observers_full_width/rfi_multimedia_element_image/eco.cooler003.jpg\">\n\n<figcaption> </figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nThen, you place the board over a window, with the bottlenecks facing towards the inside of the house. \n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://scd.observers.france24.com/files/imagecache/observers_full_width/rfi_multimedia_element_image/eco.cooler13.jpg\">\n\n<figcaption> </figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe change in pressure that occurs when air enters the wider part of the bottle and comes out through the bottleneck cools the air. \n\nIt seems uncanny, but the principle is simple. Blow on your hand with your mouth wide open. The air feels hot, doesn\u2019t it? Now, blow on your hand with your lips pursed. It feels like a cool breeze.\n\nThe Eco-Cooler doesn\u2019t require any electricity to function! \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/jPuh8IFbIzQ\n\n<blockquote>\"We finalised it just as the weather was getting hot\"\n\nThe Eco-Cooler can decrease the temperature by 5\u00b0C immediately. When it goes from 30\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C, I can tell you that it makes a difference. \n\nThe Grey group decided to take it on as a pro-bono project. We like to give back -- it\u2019s core to our company. We decided to make and distribute these units for free. We designed the first prototype in March last year and finally finalised it at the end of February this year. That\u2019s just when the weather starts getting hot in Bangladesh. \n\n\u201cThe streets here are littered with bottles, so the raw materials are easy to find\u201d\n\nTo distribute the Eco-Coolers, we teamed up with Grameen Intel Social Business Ltd. because they work in a lot of villages in Bangladesh [Editor\u2019s note: Grameen Intel is social business platform that\u2019s a partnership between NGO Grameen and the company Intel]. We sent our teams out to the villages where Grameen Intel works to teach people how to make our Eco-Coolers. \n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://scd.observers.france24.com/files/imagecache/observers_full_width/rfi_multimedia_element_image/eco-cooler.03.jpg\">\n\n<figcaption> </figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe beauty of it all is how easy these units are to make. First of all, the raw materials are easy to find: people don\u2019t recycle here, so the streets are littered with bottles. We show people how to make them and then ask them to both do it on their own and to teach others. We also made a how-to pdf that\u2019s up on our website and includes an easy step-by-step process.\n\nIt\u2019s free and people get immediate results!</blockquote>", "created_at": "2016-07-11 19:04:16", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 03:54:46.005371", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 884, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64741, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 11236, "post_number": 12, "raw": "I can make it, I think..

Est-ce que je n\u2019arr\u00eate pas tout pour faire mon truc dans mon coin, sans les autres, car la seule personne sur qui je peux conter c\u2019est moi ? Une logique peu constructive mais tellement facile qu\u2019elle nous \u00e9loigne du vrai probl\u00e8me : pourquoi n\u2019apprenons nous pas la culture de la collaboration \u00e0 partir du plus jeune \u00e2ge ?\n\nNous l\u2019entendons partout : nous sommes dans une p\u00e9riode transitionnelle, qu\u2019elle soit positive (\u00e9mergence d\u2019\u00e9conomie collaborative, renouveau des mod\u00e8les low-tech, cr\u00e9ation d\u2019outils num\u00e9riques de gestion d\u00e9centralis\u00e9e, \u2026) ou n\u00e9gative (\u00e9mergence d\u2019organisations extr\u00e9mistes, renouveau des partis populiste-fasciste, cr\u00e9ation de tactiques num\u00e9rique de propagande,\u2026) nous voyons que l\u2019importance de se retrouver sous un arbre de valeur est d\u2019une grande importance en ce moment. Les outils sont l\u00e9gions : Trello pour les fanas de post-it digital en mode collaboration, Slack comme forum organique et le saint graal de la collaboration d\u00e9centralis\u00e9s : Github. Tous ont une arm\u00e9e de fans, mais tous ont le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me : si il n\u2019y a pas une base de valeurs collaboratives sur quoi travailler, ces outils restent un beau d\u00e9cor. C\u2019est comme donner des outils de permaculture \u00e0 un fermier industriel : si il ne voit pas que les valeurs partag\u00e9es sont un atout majeur, il restera avec ces m\u00e9thodes classiques.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">La Culture de la collaboration</h3>\n\nComme n\u2019importe quelle autre id\u00e9e soci\u00e9tale, elle devient omnipr\u00e9sente quand elle est vue comme une partie de notre \u2018culture\u2019. Mais aucune id\u00e9e n\u2019a fait partie de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 confectionn\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019autre. Un premier pas pour aller vers cette \u2018Culture de la collaboration\u2019 est de voir l\u2019information comme un bateau qui doit arriver \u00e0 bon port. Ca ne sert \u00e0 rien de tenir l\u2019information pour soi, partage la avec la bonne personne, passe les bonnes id\u00e9es comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait un plateau de charcuterie \u00e0 une soir\u00e9e raclette. Chaque personne prendra bien soin de choisir l\u2019info qui lui convient le plus.\n\nCar une information qui v\u00e9hicule librement aide \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer le deuxi\u00e8me point : Ne perdez plus d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e0 r\u00e9inventer la roue mais essayer de contribuer avec des projets d\u00e9j\u00e0 existant. C\u2019est en ajoutant de nouvelles grilles de lectures, en rentrant dans un projet avec un autre angle ou d\u2019autres informations qu\u2019on apprend beaucoup. Rester dans son enclos n\u2019aide personne, m\u00eame si le r\u00e9flexe protectionniste se comprend : vous voulez contr\u00f4ler votre id\u00e9e contre un opportunisme qui pourrait se cacher derri\u00e8re chaque recoin. Mais si nous acceptions, comme c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 le cas dans les recherches universitaires, d\u2019avoir un syst\u00e8me de mentions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pour la collaboration de projet, nous devrions avoir moins peur de cet opportunisme.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Recr\u00e9er la membrane de confiance</h3>\n\nCar voil\u00e0, le grand probl\u00e8me qui se cache derri\u00e8re cette peur inn\u00e9cessaire de la protection d\u2019information: on \u00e0 perdu notre membrane de confiance entre humain. Tout dans notre entourage nous dit de se m\u00e9fier de l\u2019autre. Car comme disait ce bon vieux Sartre: L\u2019enfer c\u2019est les autres. Mais si nous relisons la th\u00e9orie du Darwinisme social nous voyons que c\u2019est notre aptitude \u00e0 collaborer qui \u00e0 fait que nous avons surv\u00e9cu aux animaux dix fois plus grand que nous, aux p\u00e9riodes glaciaire et aux famines.\n\nPour recr\u00e9er cette membrane de confiance nous ne devons pas croire dans \u2018les grand mouvements\u2019, car comme les grandes histoires, elles sont mortes avant d\u2019entrer dans la p\u00e9riode post Moderne. Soyons comme Enspiral, un r\u00e9seaux de petit groupes. Cr\u00e9ons des petits faits, pour r\u00e9apprendre \u00e0 se faire confiance. On ne doit pas d\u00e9crocher la lune, mais simplement savoir aider son voisin. La petite pierre que j\u2019apporte \u00e0 cet \u00e9difice est de prendre le caf\u00e9 chaque matin avec quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre, d\u2019\u00e9couter son histoire et de voir ou je peut faire du lien.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">L\u2019ego doit donner place \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e</h3>\n\nDans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 contemporaine nous donnons encore et toujours trop de place \u00e0 l\u2019ego, qui l\u2019emporte souvent en discussion de l\u2019id\u00e9e. Mais voil\u00e0 si nous voulons vraiment cr\u00e9er une culture de la collaboration nous devons mettre en place des freins \u00e0 l\u2019ego. De pouvoir \u00eatre fier de l\u2019ajout qu\u2019on a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 une id\u00e9e. Ne plus voir la collaboration comme une simple \u00e9conomie du (mauvais) couple, ou chacun donne et qu\u2019on fait les comptes quand \u00e7a ne va pas, mais se focaliser sur l\u2019id\u00e9e et les valeurs v\u00e9hicul\u00e9es en commun.\n\nPour \u00e7a la collaboration doit se faire par les faits et non par les mots. Trop souvent la r\u00e9union pr\u00e9c\u00e8de la participation, mais c\u2019est en faisant qu\u2019on apprend plus de la personne, que chaque personne est mise \u00e0 nue. Une expression invent\u00e9e par Nicolas de OpenFab trouve ici parfait \u00e9cho: nous devons cr\u00e9er l\u2019atome de FAIRE.\n\nUn prochain pas pourrait \u00eatre de redonner dans notre \u00e9ducation collective une vraie place \u00e0 la collaboration.

Collected data can be applied to a various range of fields.\u00a0\n\nreHub is an interface of interaction man-machine. It can be used in various areas for example the evaluation of dexterity, sport, music &amp; gaming.\n\nOur beneficiaries are all those people who needs to have an experience feedback concerning the hand movements.\n\nreHub glove is a tool designed for proprioceptive rehabilitation, to recover movement fluidity after an injury: provided by the physiotherapist, it allows the patient to record and report exercises data such as hand position, finger flexion and fingertips pressure. Recorded data are displayed through a software that reproduces a 3D hand, its movements and detected values. Through the software a physiotherapist is able to evaluate the therapeutic process and possibly change it. Thanks to reHub exercises can be done in physiotherapist presence or at a distance.\n\nReHub acquires informations about fingers movements from flex and pressure sensors. It uses a 6DOF sensor to define the position of the hand in space.\n\nreHub glove is the result of a meeting between electronics enthusiasts, a physical therapist and a hand rehabilitation patient to find a way to solve the problem of monitoring the progress during rehabilitation therapy. During this meeting we found out there are no digital devices to monitor the hand rehabilitation and we decided to develop one.\u00a0\n\nTo define our project we didn\u2019t started from a theoretical concept. We started to make the prototype and to test it.\u00a0\n\nThe development of reHub working prototype has been at the heart of our design process.\n\nAs described on <a href=\"rehub.pro\">www.rehub.pro</a>, the definition of the prototype is subdivided into 4 time frames of research and development. The first steps of the team have moved in electronics and design.\n\nAfter testing the very first glove we decided to create an integrated system with a self-produced/maker pcb. Our design has always been oriented, and always will be, to integrate all electronics on the top of the glove. Another aspect of our prototype is that the glove itself must be comfortable for the patient. At a later time, once we knew that the glove was able to transmit data to the computer, we focused on the development of a software allowing patients and physiotherapists to evaluate the glove\u2019s collected data through a graphical interface and cartesian charts.\n\nWe are looking for our final user(s), who will try our product and help us develop different options:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Sport</li>\n\n<li>Gaming</li>\n\n<li>Educational</li>\n\n<li>Medical \u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe want to built a community and start a business strategy.\n\nWe will publish tutorials, kits and software to make your glove.\n\nEverything to improve the glove solution.\n\nWe want to develop 4 different kits to sell:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>with single sensors\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>only the electronics</li>\n\n<li>glove tailored</li>\n\n<li>complete of all\n\ncomponents</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWebsites &amp; Social\n\nwww.rehub.pro\n\nwww.facebook.com/rehubglove\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-03 09:12:09", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 05:16:56.182966", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 551, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 106.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33750, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 6599, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-05-02 19:06:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:05.480950", "deleted_at": "2017-08-06 08:47:11.550310", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70265, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12669, "post_number": 1, "raw": "20% of Belgians do, with big numbers coming in daily.\nIf you use it, do you like it?

Hackathons are great for unleashing a lot of energy, bringing people together to find potential teammates etc. I have been thinking a bit about what you are trying to do. To me it makes sense  to bring together people across the different sides of an issue. We used to do a lot of this and it was great for the people at the institutional side who got a lot of energy and ideas that they could then use to shape procurement that then most of the participants risk being excluded from for many reasons of which yourself and Ahmed ar probably already aware. I think there are a number of things that could be developed in order to make this experience more generative for everyone involved. \n\nI would start by reflecting on what happens once participants leave the room? What is a good follow up process that people can plug into in order to keep working on their projects for the long period it often takes to go from idea to a viable and sustainable solution. \n\nHere I mean sustainable in two senses: 1) has a mechanism to build and sustain enough engagement from community of affected people (which includes people in public institutions) 2) has secured a fairly stable source of revenue to cover costs of materials, people's time and whatever debts are owed (including people's sweat equity).\n\nWhen you are at the beginning of your journey, it is crucial that you are exposed to the existence of relevant domain specific expertise, and have access to a network of people who can help you find your next step/ Or even just give you moral support. For me, being embedded in supportive communities of open minded, creative and very motivated people from different walks of live has been a key enabler. My own trajectory as an entrepreneur has consisted of having conversations that have unleashed a cascade of events. \n\n**I can share with you my own methodology:** \n\n1. Convene an expert event around a topic: Always focused on taking a deeper look at the actual technology itself, the opportunities as well as the risks that come with it. In this case it is a [workshop on AI](https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them-19-11-brussels/10326/59) \n2. Reach out via my/our extended network to find people with deep experience and knowledge relevant to that topic to invite them to the workshop. Make sure that at least some of them are connected to possible opportunities to support/encourage participants to continue working together.\n3. Ahead of the event I conduct with each person an in depth interview about the topic such as [this one with Marco](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-does-it-take-to-build-a-successful-movement-for-citizens-to-gain-control-over-when-how-and-to-what-use-automated-systems-are-introduced-and-used-in-society/11075) \n\nYou notice that these articles are posted on the platform by the person who has been interviewed? This means that people can then get back in touch with them and continue a conversation, ask them for input on their initiatives etc. We connect them with other participants in a community of mutual support.

With methods for collaborating globally being one aspect, another is what to do with the open insulin protocol once it is there.\n\nIn order to keep incentives aligned and the decision making power with the patients, we came up with the idea of a patient cooperative to govern a sort of generic insulin manufacturing company. Everyone has a non-transferrable share and is involved in the decision making process of what happens with the gains from the cooperative's activities.\n\nDo patients want cheaper insulin? That would be possible.\nDo patients want to invest into research for better forms of insulin? That would be possible.\nDo patients want a combination, where the financially comfortable patients invest their gains in better insulin, while the poorer choose for cheaper insulin? That would (or should be) possible, although it will require more complex forms of governance.\nDo patients want to invest in an actual cure, instead of remaining dependant on insulin as a treatment? That would be possible.\n\nUltimately, resources would stay inside the circle of people who stand to benefit the most from the productive activities, without external predators to capitalize on their ilness.\n\nThere are many questions, limitations and remarks around design and implementation of such a cooperative. We hope to explore those during the workshop part of the Open Insulin session at OpenVillage Festival. It will be a collaborative brainstorm format, focussed on concrete solutions, rather than a philosophical exploration of the idea.\n\nI hope we can already start off the discussion here in anticipation of the event.

Thanks!\n\n(It doesn't have to be a detailed translation of all\u00a0the content above, a couple of paragraphs highlighting the key aspects of your concept would do the job!)\n\nTalking about the proposal,\u00a0I like the idea of helping doctors communicating \u00a0more efficiently with each other in order to help patients, as a consequence,\u00a0in relieving the weight of their own personal pathological condition. Besides being a psychological kind of weight, for instance when a patient has to explain multiple times his/her condition to a series of different medical specialists, it could also lead to misinterpretation and diagnosis issues when for instance there might be a language barrier.\n\nNow this leads to two different considerations:\n\n1 Based on my design experience, it is extremely hard to convince workers in the standard medical field (hospital,\u00a0primary care physicians, etc...)\u00a0to adopt a new kind of CRM software for multiple reasons: regulations issues due to privacy and national laws, obligations in using a specific software, affection to a well known software in contrast to the commitment in learning a new one,(even when the new one has better user experience...\u00a0)\u00a0\n\n2 Such a digital system/experience could be way more powerful when there is actually a language barrier and/or the patient itself is in a context s/he doesn't know very well how to swim in.\n\nThis made me think of trying to change the context of the concept and switch to scenarios such as the activity of ONGs like Doctors Without Borders, or thinking at care issues\u00a0in\u00a0refugee camps on European soil\u00a0at this present day.\n\nI believe that re-thinking the service/app in terms of the specific needs in the scenarios above could lead to\u00a0interesting solutions and could work for different reasons:\n\n- I suppose the physicians working in these scenarios would be more free to choose their own set of tools as long as they are effective in solving real problems quickly\u00a0\n\n- I suppose they would generally\u00a0meet patients very quickly, maybe one time only, and then address them to other physicians\n\n- It would solve the language barrier issue of the patient since the two physicians are communicating \"in the background\"\n\nOf course all of these hypotheses would need validation through research in the field.\n\nDo you think this approach could be of your interest and would you like to give it a try?\n\nHappy to hear your thoughts about it :)\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-17 16:17:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:05.586573", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 497, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26194, "user_id": 36, "topic_id": 1119, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>LIKE IT!</b>\n\nI think, the draft, is very good and gives an overall view of what means to live in\u00a0Matera.\n\n&gt; I would put an info more about the fact that the Sassi was evaquated and the new city (really interesting) started in 1951.\u00a0\n\nAbout the stats I would not put too many beacuse you can undestand many things just coming here in Matera.

What you'll find here are my notes from the IT strategy discussion between @hugi, @owen and myself on 2019-11-20.\n\n\n## 1. IT resourcing in general\n\n* In very general, we need to have more resources assigned to IT.\n\n* To justify that spending, we provide the strategic plan below.\n\n\n## 2. Deployment infrastructure\n\n* We need a staging Discourse website.\n\n* We settle on Netlify for static website deployment for now. It's a good option until we need sites with a backend / database. Can and should use a \"netlify-production\" branch on Git from which to deploy.\n\n* We will look at load times etc. to decide about using a CDN etc..\n\n* We will use Digital Ocean to place Virtual Machine images for experimental deployments. Images can also be stored there while not in use, causing less cost. This is a good option for any experiment that would \"mess up\" the production server by requiring major changes to its software.\n\n\n## 3. Webkit for our project websites\n\nSpecialized websites for different events and topics is nice, but it's too much effort for the outcome. Consumes a lot of time. They should be generated in a much more standardized way. That's where Owen is going now. The first version of that is visible already on [now.netlify.com](https://now.edgeryders.eu/).\n\nThe goal should be that even for a small project, somebody can put together a website based on components from an existing toolkit. Also the sites are similar to use for every new event.\n\nLater, this kind of software would be used for \"gradual introduction to Edgeryders\": they use that software first, the edgeryders.eu forum later. It could even be published right on the edgeryders.eu frontpage, moving the forum to forum.edgeryders.eu or similar.\n\nOwen is developing this at the moment, based on ideas and input from @nadia. It will have several functions in its initial version, allowing to use it as a front-facing website for Edgeryders live events and projects:\n\n* A Discourse SSO login, using our communities.edgeryders.eu login provider. This already works.\n\n* A Twitter-wall like function, aggregating content from Telegram channel, a Twitter hashtag etc.\n\n* A way to select parts of this aggregated content as an admin and post it to Discourse as one combined post, using the Discourse quotation style that shows the Discourse profile image of the quote author alongside\n\n* A way of aggregating various media content by type from the Discourse website (videos, audio etc.), to make that content more visible. \n\nEverything for that toolkit should be in Vue.js component form. That's already done. James' [edgeryders-form](https://github.com/edgeryders/edgeryders-form) software would also be integrated into this framework as a Vue.js component. To prevent a duplication of effort, it will replace the other form software component that Owen made once for a somewhat different use case.\n\nLater, this framework would also include a login to edgeryders.eu, allowing to post to the forum based on activity in the front-facing website.\n\nWhen this framework needs to talk to an API, we should try to not have a separate (caching) serverside component for this, but to always directly access the Discourse API. This way, we have one single API to access, and all the documentation, installation, access credential etc. issues have to only be solved once. Where the JavaScript web application would like to see a more comfortable / specialized API, there are two options:\n\n* Internal, client-side JavaScript library that provides this more comfortable interface. The server load of more requests sent to Discourse is not a major issue, as it's just about short API queries with a JSON response.\n\n* Where necessary, we can extend the Discourse API with Ruby on Rails code, as we have done before.\n\n\n## 4. Other strategic planning\n\nWe got four IT areas in Edgeryders: online conversation, events facilitation, collaborative sensemaking, internal processes. Collective intelligence and events software stuff is directly tied to income.\n\n* **Internal standardization.** Some decisions that we made during the 2019-11-20 meeting:\n\n    * Vue.js as framework for JavaScript web application development.\n    * Tailwind as CSS framework. Can be extended with additional components. 17k stars.\n\n* **Open Ethnographer as a generic tool.** Do we want to tie Open Ethnographer to Discourse as a general annotation solution? Hugi: Amelia says that our Open Ethnographer for Discourse is a \"state of the art\" solution for online ethnography already. So we could also go for a more general solution, like a browser plugin that allows to use Open Ethnographer on any website. This means, there are these two possible futures for Open Ethnographer. We can keep both open. At least at the level of data compatibility, even though it would probably be two parallel software projects that only share some components.\n\n* **Mixed media.** In the longer run, ideally we should mix media more. Like an app to podcast / videocast to the forum. That should ideally be in Discourse. Including features like \"quoting audio\". That would be nice to post to Discourse upstream. Meant to be able to reach \"unusual suspects\": people who are not great at writing. *(by: Hugi)*\n\n    We could have a view of all content by Open Ethnographer, as text, audio and video, right on the public-facing portion of the Edgeryders website. In a way so that it presents a screencast, from which people can dive into the content and connect to people. That could be a new way of storytelling, and of generating income. *(by: Hugi)*\n\n* **Upgrading Graphryder.** It *has* to be upgraded. It should be integrate-able as a component into Owen's frontend software. To show to users. We should leave Neo4j behind, as they provide crippleware with a lot of features only in the enterprise version. But there are multiple open source alternatives. Hugi: There's all kinds of technical debt in Graphryder, even in the visualization part. Linkurious etc.. So we might want to redo that part as well. Also including ways to visualize in a way that adapts more to the style we have in the frontend facing sites.\n\n* **Moving from Riot to Discourse.** There is currently an interesting feature convergence happening between productivity-focused business chat software (Slack, Rocket Chat, Riot) and modern forum software (Discourse). Both now include threads (in a flat threading model with reply-to information), subscriptions, some form of real-time notifications, @mentions, and even the same sets of emojis.\n\n    So if we extend Discourse with (1) a real-time notification system that works well with mobile devices and (2) Slack-style dashboard of subscribed categories and topics (\"channels\" in Slack) and direct message topics (same in Slack), we won't need Riot anymore. The quick-and-dirty discussions that should not enter the organizational memory which happen now on Riot should then simply be direct message topics in Discourse. (And we can even have a mechanism that erases these after some time.)", "created_at": "2019-11-21 16:59:52.537599", "updated_at": "2020-03-07 15:47:12.158918", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1167, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 87.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3622, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73574, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13013, "post_number": 25, "raw": "[quote=\"salvo_cognetti, post:24, topic:13013\"]\nPossibly statisticians - to help sift thru the noise of badly done statistics (usually retrospective studies), underreported deaths for a variety of confounding reasons, etc.\n[/quote]\n\n\nExcellent point about statisticians, @salvo_cognetti. @MariaEuler has already written about the difficulty she and others have when dealing with the reporting of statistical results \u2013 she calls it [statistically feeling bad](/t/12845). \n\nSo, we are going to be starting to look into the issue of how the pandemic shifts society towards tighter surveillance via policies that are presented as based on medical evidence next week, at [this event](/t/13089).

So now the accumulated capital buys out everything up for sale because globally no new markets of scale available.\n\nYou can also see this in the EU, for example the low interest loans to Turkey for real estate development that goes unpopulated & then loan defaults. Greece just keeps on getting one loan on top of another, serial defaults, each new round of debt greater than the last to cover the accumulated interest & mandating austerity that cripples the ability to pay off anything. In the USA just the interest on the national debt now nears the entire GDP yet it is still seen as a safe investment so the debt goes higher.\n\nWith mutually assured destruction by nukes, capitalists no longer have conventional wars available to destroy surplus value & open up room for new investment & development.\n\nThis just multiplies the threats of the end of USA global hegemony, driving domestic right-wing fears & ongoing crisis of enlightenment democracy.

In the last 9 months i build it up again with a peak in activity the last 2-3 months. On the program where quasi full workshops every week, a brunch every week for around 40 people, catering gigs for European commision, flemish governement and steps towards investing in a production facility and test kitchen. \n\nMarch would have been the first big month with a possibility of 100% payment, and it was looking as i could have been hiring maybe in the next two to four months. \n\nBut then Corona struck and 95% of my activity just stopped in a fraction of a second. It took me about two weeks just to digest this complete stop of a vehicle i was pushing for the last couple of months, hoping that it would gain speed and traction. \n\nLast week i decided to pick up the activity step by step by offering [confinement packs](https://www.fermenthings.be/confinement-survival-pack/) with the products from the shop, this to keep me busy and to be able to do two things: \n\n1. pay my loan back\n2. pay rent (even if i hope CPAS could do a gesture) \n3. Offer products from other producers that also see their business go to a complete stop\n\nIt worked, in the last two weeks i sold around 96 packs and have been able to order from different local producers and at least give the stock a good turnover again. \n\nBut i still feel a frustration, one that is that i don't know what to do, because i don't know when and how things will be get going again. Do i just sit it out, and polish the edges of what i was doing, do i start producing my own stuff (a project that i wanted to start at the end of the year) , do i rethink my business? Many questions, and many of those that i think a lot of small projects are feeling at the moment. \n\nAnd all of this is just on a personal level, i'm haunted with questions on how this whole crisis can or can't be a vector in sociatal change. I'm a hopefull person, but my mind is wondering between light and dark places all the time, because all this is new, fresh and not yet graspable.

You can and should be doing this work in parallel with the coding itself.\n\n* Take the rest of the week (**til the 17th of July**) to resolve any low-hanging fruit -- easy merges, etc -- since everyone's codebooks should not be gaining new codes by then, and firm up your own edits based upon others' feedback as best you can. \n\nWe will then plan to meet the **week of the 20th**, at which point I will have created the new SSNA visualisation. In that meeting we will:\n* a) discuss and carry out more complex code merges we have noted \n* b) create hierarchies in the backend based upon the categories we have created in our own codebooks and\n*  c) discuss the SSNA and what it means for future coding. \n\nThe deadline for a writeup of your findings based upon our meeting and the visualisation is **August 1st**. \n\nCan everyone please verbally confirm that this works for them, and if not let us know why (e.g. if you will be on holiday the week of the 20th) so we can plan otherwise.

How to encourage them to use it, and what would be the purpose?\n\nOne way is for Natalia and Noemi to join Borderland event and bring an ER contingent there this summer\n\n\n**Amelia** is currently working on H2020 projects and POPREBEL. Will be in Krakow on March 20-22 with her training and a talk at the Fatigue project; Currently working on the call for ethnographers. Hoping we can get people to the training in April in Brussels. \nHer frustration is communication - there is a sense of people from both (project) teams having to be on the platform, and it's difficult to get them on board. \n\n\n**Natalia** Now is working on community management in POPREBEL, outreach events too. Community managing Trust in Play (with Matteo U); going to an art event in Riga ArtGora, around gender equality in mid-April, also as a student of Culture Backstage program for cultural entrepreneurs will go to Paris and take part in an event organized in Gaite Lyrique with Creature - for cultural professionals. Two chances to mingle with culture people. And I got invited to join the summer school in scriptwriting, for which I also helped invite Matteo - this is in Bulgaria in August, also a great chance to expand my network. \n\nWhat I'd like to have is us constantly honing our offer and an idea of what we want to do, so I have stuff to preset. \n\nHugi suggests holding one of the meetings in Sweden - LARP is world famous, the gaming community is huge and he could possibly bring some of them to the space, or run a game at Borderland and crowdfund it. \n\n\n**Matthias** has switched biofab forum on the discourse federated setup. they have their own platform now. Was also contacted by Gilda, who retired from Council of Europe and offered him a collaboration, if a project passes. He also started some trials with Paycoupons - the platform is ready in terms of software, but it does not have a community. Kathmandu sounded promising as a startup environment, but we're also starting something in Venezuela, in response to the crisis, for which we always imagined this platform to work well. He is also looking for ideas - what could be offered on the marketplace?\n\n\n**Noemi** is planning a series of talks about space/sustainable access to physical spaces and arts and culture, with people who founded ARP and Jubilee in Brussels. We could have a distributed network of events analyzing the same problem in cities in Europe and learning from it. It's not only interesting and relevant but also helps us establish ourselves in the European cultural scene. We also need someone to do communication for us - working on hiring someone, to get the word out about work we do. We also want to have a website for culture squad and some graphic materials to make it pretty. \n\n\n**Alberto** is continuing his work on Climate-KIC proposal, he spoke to Michelle and put together a new version of the Reef vision to present to their internal meeting on March 11th.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1JYRH6Otx_i9yF1LfzcBeTTdim04mUjHVtmlozHXCV4Q/edit\n\n&nbsp;\n\n@amelia @alberto @noemi @matthias @hugi @John", "created_at": "2019-03-01 11:53:21.169656", "updated_at": "2019-03-01 12:41:47.106916", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 624, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 198.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4022, 3, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55947, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 9511, "post_number": 38, "raw": "Checking now.", "created_at": "2019-07-01 11:26:14.470874", "updated_at": "2019-07-01 11:26:14.470874", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [55944], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62673, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 11325, "post_number": 4, "raw": "edit at will :)", "created_at": "2019-10-31 15:25:57.532456", "updated_at": "2019-10-31 15:25:57.532456", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 18.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [62670], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51714, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 9621, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2019-03-15 19:21:33.108478", "updated_at": "2019-03-15 19:21:33.108478", "deleted_at": "2019-03-21 14:34:33.595204", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3704, 4022, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66315, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 12004, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**The EU\u2019s new Commission is looking to approve a new AI directive, and of course democratic participation is important to ensure a good law. What do you feel necessary from EU to participate?**\n\nWhy are we pushing for AI? The end of Moore\u2019s law. The money we seek in are more unlike to come back. Industry took a risk at specialised chips: AI and blockchain-specific. So, now they need to create a demand for these chips. We should be aware of the vendor-driven nature of this stuff, and think about how to regulate these companies.\n\nThe business model of Big Tech now is based on keeping the code, providing cloud services and collecting data to profile and ultimately influence users. They cross-subsidize their cloud services with their marketing revenue streams. If you want to fight that, you should have public cloud infrastructure, which is a trillion-EUR affair. That\u2019s your investment in human-centric AI infrastructure.\n\nCompanies like Google optimise with AI the profilazione of their customers. The difference is if it\u2019s a data centered AI or not. \u2026 ? Where do we bring the democratic process into new models?\n\n\n**Can we think of counterproductive regulation on the Internet? Stuff like the copyright directive? how did we end up with all these things, that used to be a public good, end up being someone\u2019s property?**\n\nWe optimize relationships. This is problematic. For example, we have marketing companies working with civil liberties organizations, that tell their clients: we can tell you which of your donors care about which issues, so you can optimize for issues where you get more money.\n\nOptimisation has been the logic as far, but it can go wrong anyway. Traffic is a perfect example. If you look at optimization system, it comes at a cost and if you don\u2019t do internalise the cost it causes bigger damages. Apparently innocent choices as what to optimize for turn out to have huge consequences. When you design traffic, do you optimize for driver safety? Or for pedestrian safety? Of minimize time spent on the road?\n\nSEDA on feedbacks: I know GDPR, it\u2019s regulated anyway. There are serious problems on how GDPR focuses on personal data on individuals.\nWe talk about automated decisions, but there is a set of criteria \u2026 the optimization is not about the single person, but as pbe part of a certain group which operates certain choices in general. So, you expect to empower people, but actually you don\u2019t. Paul Olivier Dehaye is trying to pool data from different workers to see if people are being discriminated. This is called a \u201cdata trust\u201d. There is also the DECODE project that is doing something they called \u201cdata commons\u201d.\n\nWe are now in a mess with the GDPR. Uber, for example, uses it to refuse to give drivers their data, saying this impacts the rights of the riders. This (says Seda) is the consequence of focusing on personal rights when the data are used to optimize over populations.\n\n\n**Do we actually need AI?

I'm in Scotland, so this adds additional frustration, although the Scottish Government is now beginning to prepare legislation to enable another referendum on Scottish independence within the next 2-3 years. To a certain extent, the outcome of Brexit may influence opinion, although at the moment, the balance remains close to 50/50 for Scottish independence.\n\nNow for Brexit. Alter a tumultuous week in British politics, one thing is at least clear. The UK will not be leaving the EU on 29 March. Parliament has not been able to agree anything much recently, but agreed by 413 votes to 202 that the government should request an extension of the Article 50 process. How long that extension will be and how the extra time should be used, like everything else with Brexit, is an open question. All the same outcomes are still on the table. Only four serious ones at the moment exist: accepting the existing deal (the government is having yet another vote on this next Tuesday,and some who opposed the deal this week are thinking of changing their minds to support it after all); leaving without a deal; holding a further series of indicative votes to test support for alternative deals (e.g. Norway style deal or remaining in the customs union); holding another referendum. \nIf I were to bet. I think the PM's third attempt to persuade Parliament to support her current deal  (Tuesday) will be very close indeed. Her hopes are pinned on the attorney-general providing fresh legal advice about the Irish backstop issue. Apparently, the UK could use the Vienna Convention to exit the Irish backstop, which might be enough to win over the Brexit hardliners and the DUP. Is so, the deal might scrape through, but it would still need a significant number of Labour votes. In the last vote on the deal, there were only 3 Labour supporters! \nIf the deal does not pass, the PM will still need to ask the 27 EU members to agree an extension, and they will need to agree how long the extension will be. EU leaders are now divided; some want a short extension (to 30 June); others believe there is no point to that and prefer a longer extension to 2020/21. A long delay may include a requirement for UK to hold elections for the European Parliament in May. This would leave both Conservatives and Labour open to new pro- and anti-EU parties, and the only way to break the deadlock could then result in another referendum (even though that option was rejected by a very large majority earlier this week). The probable choice would be to leave the EU with the existing deal, or remain in the EU after all!.It is estimated that the UK government has spent about a billion pounds so far negotiating the deal, preparing for no deal, etc. \nThe saga goes on.....", "created_at": "2019-03-15 19:28:48.065467", "updated_at": "2019-03-15 19:28:48.065467", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 498, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 98.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70051, "user_id": 4357, "topic_id": 12548, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Je trouve aussi ce projet tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant et vous souhaite une bonne concr\u00e9tisation :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2020-02-10 10:42:06.915170", "updated_at": "2020-02-10 10:42:06.915170", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 56.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6078, 3703, 6134], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48148, "user_id": 3987, "topic_id": 9108, "post_number": 13, "raw": "This is super exciting @hugi et al! \n\nI wonder whether http://app.autopo.co/ could be part of this somehow?", "created_at": "2018-10-27 17:37:55.230659", "updated_at": "2018-10-27 17:37:55.230659", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 50, "score": 85.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11554, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3262, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Not a good idea</b>\n\nProbably not, Ksenia.

And that is a big problem if you use data from government databases, because that data is often not reliable.\n[/quote]\n\nThat depends on what we mean by \u201ca good prediction\u201d, @antonekker. If we are happy with being \u201cgood\u201d (outperforming randomness) at the aggregate level, we might need very little data. For example, in predicting the outcome of football matches, the simplest model \u201cthe home team always wins\u201d does (a little) better than random. Hal Varian (Google\u2019s chief economist) a few years ago went on record saying \u201cif you have 99% correlation, who cares about causation\u201d, or something like that. But this extra performance only applies to predicting a whole lot of football matches (the population), while being useless if you are trying to predict one match in particular.\n\nI think @katejsim worries that prejudices outperform randomness.  *If you don\u2019t care about fairness and the rights of the individual* , you could indeed predict that the poorer neighbors would have more social welfare fraud than rich ones. But this would come at the expense of treating poorer individuals fairly, and, unlike with football matches, it would end up reinforcing the conditions that force those people to apply for welfare in the first place.\n\n\n\n[antonekker](https://edgeryders.eu/u/antonekker):\n\n\nInteresting point.\n\nTaking the possible consequences for citizens in account, the predictions should actually be much better than just \u2018good\u2019.

You have two choices: \n\n* either collapse them into a n\u2013multiple code, like `homosexuality:discrimination:workplace:large_cities:poland`\n* or attribute each of the n codes separately. \n\nThe latter solution will show up as an n-clique in the semantic graph, with all codes connected to each other.

Obviously you are considering a zero-growth model. But I think zero-growth models are untenable -- they would require that technology not advance. For a simple well-known example, it is a truism that since the 70s the quantity of oil used per dollar of output in the US has fallen by 50%. If you are inclined to argue (and I usually am), you could say that a lot of this is because we have off-shored manufacturing to China & such and moved to services, which are much less energy-intensive. And that is true. But it would be exaggerating to say that this covers *all* of the reduction. In practice we develop technologies that conserve scarce resources; the more resources are used, the more expensive they become -- this leads either to technology that enables us to exploit more of the same resources (as with oil sands technology and fracking), or technology that enables us to use less of those resources (as with more efficient internal combustion engines).\n\nOf course this doesn't explain the many extinctions of animals such as the dodo and passenger pigeon, the looming pangolin and many many other species extinctions, etc. If anything, these come about as a result of bad economics -- a failure of rationality. Many key people refuse to believe the evidence of their eyes and ears in the service of their interests until it is too late. But this is irrational -- they would be much better served AS CAPITALISTS by conserving those resources and maintaining supply.\n\nThe other piece is that technology of production would never be adopted unless and until it enables the manufacturer to supply the product at a lower cost. The cost reduction could be from any aspect of production -- lower cost labor or capital or natural resources -- but the highest-cost and scarcest item would be the one to focus on -- if you run out of a resource, and that prevents you from producing the product, that is again bad economics.\n\nI end up coming around to the conclusion that people propose steady-state economies for fundamentally moral reasons -- not really economic reasons. And the science fiction stories you reference are morality tales in the guise of stories about technology and economics. And I don't mind morality tales at all (I'm a major Tolkien fan), but I don't want to confuse them with sound economics.\n\nSo I don't know about \"exponential\" growth -- that sounds too deterministic to me -- but I would sign up for \"continuous\" growth, again because we wouldn't adopt the technology unless it enables growth. And by growth of course I mean an improvement in life by however means we define it -- because after all, it isn't \"growth\" unless it is an improvement. And that means per capita, not necessarily for the economy as a whole. Population growth is only positive in poor countries at this stage in history -- rich countries have negative population growth, and that is perfectly fine. And I would greatly resist the idea that those poor countries are \"slaves\" or similar to rich ones -- just look at China, which has become rich by making and selling stuff to rich countries -- and which is on the brink of pretty severe negative population growth.\n\nThere is a very insightful book I have been reading lately by W. Brian Arthur ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Brian_Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Brian_Arthur)), called The Nature of Technology ([http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/thenatureoftechnology.htm](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/thenatureoftechnology.htm)). It posits a model of the economy as an evolving technological organism. I've been toying with the idea that this should be a new theory of how economies operate, and might make a great scifi novel (in the hands of a better writer than I). He points out that technology evolves because an intractable problem emerges, and it is then ultimately solved with a new technology, which then causes its own set of problems, ad infinitum. \n\nBest wishes,\n\n*Phillip Tussing*\n\n- \"The Universe... is matter that thinks, but with an abysmally low intellect\"\n\n-Lem (after Spinoza)", "created_at": "2020-03-10 04:33:27", "updated_at": "2020-03-10 04:35:44.066485", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 719, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 11.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [71017], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80420, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 14052, "post_number": 11, "raw": "If this is how you want to record consent, you can wrap Jamie's comment in the following way by editing it: \n\n```\n<!-- yes i consent to this being published in my name/ on my behalf -->\n```\n\nThis will make it into a HTML comment, which is only visible in the HTML source code (via \"Inspect Element\" in the browser, and when editing the topic) but not to the human eye when looking at the topic.

This has some bad effects. Many of us who are external to the hierarchy or team in question find ourselves doing emotional and interpersonal support work, often without being able to help formally. There\u2019s a reason most organisations have either an HR person or a welfare officer, depending on the kind of org. This is another situation where formal structures are our friend \u2013 firstly because when people know the expectations of them, it is easier to feel safe and to meet them. Secondly, when people have a clear understanding of who they can safely talk to when they have issues, anxiety levels decrease and problems don\u2019t get out of control \u2013 they can be dealt with early at a small level.\n\nThe ER Board agreed last year to designate me as a kind of HR ombudsman who can listen to anyone's issues, complaints, problems, etc. without prejudice who is then empowered to try to find resolution among the parties.

So far, nobody has taken me up on this. New people probably don't even know about it, and the one time I tried to bring someone back into the fold via such a conversation, I was refused.\n\nBut the offer still stands.  I will not breech a confidence if that is required.  And I will not have a secondary agenda other than clarity and everyone's wellbeing. But generally such issues need to have the relevant parties come to some sort of table to talk things out in a moderated fashion with someone as a fair witness.  The Board wanted me to be that person and again, I am available to anyone in this org who wishes it.\n\nI have been involved in some of the hiring based on this role, but lately not.

We\u2019ve spoken about the co-working sector and explored ways in which we can build economies that [incorporate green energy](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14521), but another way we can aid recovery - and use the situation to rebuild broken systems for future generations - is to focus on the localisation of food.\n\nWhy would we import vegetables from the other side of the world, when we can support a local farmer that plucks them from the ground on the very same day that they can hit the bottom of our pan?\n\nThroughout the pandemic, producers that have lost customers - due to the closure of restaurants and cafes - have been really innovative in bringing their fresh products to locals in their communities. We have seen this happen across the world.\n\nPeople have willingly returned to this more traditional way of food buying. For some it's a way of life that never truly fell away with farmers' markets still a part of many cultures but an upsurge in this way of shopping has happened in recent months and perhaps new habits will now form that continue to support local farmers and producers into the future.  \n\nAt Edgeryders we have previously carried out research on food security and profiled areas in Serbia which have given way to[ large-industrial farming](https://edgeryders.eu/t/local-food-will-be-priceless-how-do-we-fight-big-agribusinesses-and-talk-to-farmers-to-produce-in-traditional-ways/14651). This has inevitably made it harder for smaller farmers to survive.\n\nWe are running a webinar this Friday, 30th October, to discuss some [critical questions](https://edgeryders.eu/t/critical-questions-you-can-help-answer-before-the-event-on-food-localisation-on-30-october/14645) relating to food sustainability, organic farming and agri-business.

I came across this application and I read all the content on NGI website, trying to understand what\u2019s the topic and how it relates to me. I think this is something that would be really in line with my experience so far, and this topic is one of the most important in my personal story.\n\nI\u2019ve been working with internet since I\u2019m very small, I got my first computer when I was around nine years old and I think that my education and personal development was really influenced by the online environment, which is also why I work so easily with it. The fact that I\u2019ve been using the internet since I was so young it\u2019s one of the reasons why I deeply care about its future, I always thought that the openess and decentralization are the keys of its success and what makes it a valuable tool for collaboration and communication. When I was a teenager I\u2019ve been endorsing my studies and practices collaborating on Wikipedia.org, with a national and international community, something that is now really rooted in my skills and which is also a great practice of openess and a great example of how online collaboration can offer many possibilities in individual lives. Also open source licenses and philosophy have always been one of my core values in what I do.\n\nI have a very vast experience in onine community managing. I\u2019ve been part, over the last decade, of different international networks, Roots &amp; Routes International, Generation Europe, as well as local networks using online tools as well. With Roots &amp; Routes, I\u2019ve been managing community debates and online discussions between participants coming from different countries, encountering many problems but also winning lots of challenges that we had to face in order to keep the community together and work at distance. Working in online communities became always more important for me and I\u2019ve been developing these skills through the creation of different inivitatives, which are still using online tools to create collaboration and participation.\n\nFor example, during the last 3-4 years I\u2019ve been entering many active groups of citizens also at a local level, activist groups and grassroot initiatives which I\u2019m facilitating. I worked with environmental groups such as \u201cMamme No Inceneritore\u201d which is consisting of hundred of activists organizing themselves over social networks; I proposed over the last months a Transition Town in my area \u201cValdisieve in Transizione\u201d which apart from meeting in real life is adopting several online tools to promote practical activities.\n\nSince the last two months I\u2019m also coordinating, on a volounteer level, the \u201cFridays For Future\u201d group of students in Florence and connecting them to a network with all the organizations from Italy, in order to discuss the protests and the contents about climate change. This was an experience on how to manage a big group of people who I don\u2019t personally know, and though it was hard, i\u2019m trying to keep my facilitation tools and practices at their best, so to help the debate keeping the neutrality and originality of the discussion without manipulations. I\u2019ve been training hard in defending the collective mind, I also can do it in debates in real life, but my tools are very useful also in online discussions.\n\nAll of my networks are more or less directly working on the topics of NGI, if some of them really rely on the internet and other less, the core values of this project can be reflected in all of them and I think that I could create a nice connection between these networks and this project. Mostly on the topics of openess, inclusivity, transparency and cooperation.\n\nPersonally this job could well fit my lifestyle, as I work as a freelancer I can arrange easily my schedule and follow the project without many problems, both for the online work and the physical events. I can mediate conflicts and I\u2019m very good in helping with online platforms, I\u2019ve been teaching a lot in school this kind of topics. I\u2019m very fluent in English and Italian is my first language.\n\nI hope I\u2019m providing enough informations, [you can find my CV here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TSE1qTG1MHYsIgryKGYeMLlB-anKL_5Y7S3mZ4JjzE4/edit?usp=sharing), is not so updated with everthing I do, because I had to make some selection and it\u2019s hard to keep track of everything (it\u2019s so much!) but you can find also some links of other works and communities I follow there. (I\u2019ll update the experiences part with my last year by tomorrow morning...)\n\nThanks a lot for reading and considering my application! Hope that anyway this project will go very well as it is a really important topic and it\u2019s really necessary to influence the policies to achieve a really good internet in the future.\n\nLorenzo", "created_at": "2019-03-13 14:24:15.885951", "updated_at": "2019-03-13 14:24:15.885951", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 841, "wiki": false, "reads": 49, "score": 79.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64476, "user_id": 5032, "topic_id": 11464, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Nice!

We have also been organizing educational workshops for instance FabLab Rinoteca woodwork workshop or training for welder, baker etc.\n\n<strong>Questions</strong>\n\n<strong>How would you describe the first reception process?</strong>\n\nFrom the moment migrants arrive to Italy, more precisely to Sicily, they are being transferred to reception centers depending on the available places. The new legislation on the migrants placement implies transfer depending on the municipal availability in the non-emergency periods. The summer, for example, can be described as continuous emergency period because weather conditions make it easier to travel.\n\n<strong>How would you describe your working hours, do they change and if so, depending on what?</strong>\n\nOur shifts and working hours are usually from 9 until 6, but also we always have on 24 hour call one or more persons, available to help if necessary. Working hours are not fixed but flexible and workers organize the by themselves depending on necessities.\n\n<strong>What are the medical data that are being collected from the asylum seeker on the first reception?</strong>\n\nOn the occasion of first encounter between reception center worker and the migrant, they are normally filling in the form, provided by county government, with personal data and information on health state. On their arrival in Sicily, they are being examined by the first aid team; the process usually consists in fever/temperature measurement, the mandatory tuberculosis test and the regular doctor checkup.\n\n<strong>What are the checkups that are being performed on the first emergency (arrival to Italy)?</strong>\n\nFirst Aid, for example treating wounds caused by the conditions of travel, fever and if serious problems are presented it is inserted in the migrant\u2019s info sheet and the record.\n\n<strong>Are the doctors in charge of the first visit always the same or they change?</strong>\n\nThe doctors are not being chosen by the reception center staff but they are so called STP doctors. This means that they are treating patients that are not covered by health insurance or they are general doctors with an independent office and not employees of the hospital. In Marta\u2019s experience they are usually not very thorough with the patients case and in fact once migrants are provided with health insurance they are not advised to consult STP doctors.\n\n<strong>On what criteria are doctors chosen?</strong>\n\nMarta was not able to provide this information, contact directly a doctor to clarify this.\n\n<strong>How are the collected data being managed?</strong>\n\nFirst step is filling in the form with all the personal data, history of previous diseases and therapies, also if if there were wounds or fever caused by the travel it is being noted. Often happens that this first form is not filled in because the first checkup is performed in a hurry and superficially. Afterwards, once the migrants are transferred to reception centers the staff receives the copy of this form and they add more info and more detailed and elaborated record on the migrant that is being sent to the municipality officials. This form is scanned and sent by email. The lack of a database is targeted as a problem as well as the management of hard copy records and documents.\n\n<strong>What are the major problems during the doctors\u2019 visits?</strong>\n\nA logistical problem is that there is no any information prior to the arrival of the migrants to the reception center in order to prepare better. They come by a bus and the staff is not informed neither on their medical state nor the nationality, sex and age in order to preogranize the visits and accommodation.\n\n@alessandro_contini @silviad.ambrosio @ChiaraFrr\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-07 14:31:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:05.772673", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 897, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33824, "user_id": 3311, "topic_id": 6579, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Energized!</b>\n\nHi @CarolineM\n\nSo great to meet you. If you are based in CT, then please do reach out I'd love to meet with you and consider a conversation in person. I agree with you with regards to relaying information beyond academia and forging collaborations between academia and larger/broader audiences. This has been the preemptive step to the current project and various talks I've had with various institutions.\n\nI agree that visual approaches bridge educational divides and somewhat diffuses jargon. This has assisted me in relaying scientific knowledge to other audiences. I've been actively involved in collaboratively designing Events to this purpose, which not only provides knowledge in \"digestable\" means to community members, but are key for Scientists to observe as well. Each event has been learning for me, and I'm now testing the efficacy of presenting data in a different manner in communities, i.e. arts, or fun interactive events within communities in a pop-up fashion.\n\nLanga has a very dynamic collaboration scene between artists and community members, as well as the private sector. It's a phenomenal community and I was assisting with a local tech-startup focused on providing community members with tech-training. Completely fascinating and I am trying to access various communities, as I find that given South Africa's current dynamic and transport restrictions communities tend to be territorial bound in its activities and collaborations.\n\nThe Work with local CCWs is still a focus for the Sustainable Livelihoods Foundation, who I was employed by. I managed various projects using various participatory approaches to explore lived experience and provide an outlet for expression. One of our projects funded by the Making All Voices iniative sought to bring these issues faced by CCWs to the City governance structure. It was a phenomenal experience trying to track down CABS and Clinic Boards (whom only exist on paper). There is a network we found that are actively working for the benefit of CCWs, but gov has cut funding for this network and introduced a new structure that is completely defunct and has no community representation (based on my findings in 2016).\n\n@Noemi you've raised an important point. \" How do these 'larger audience'\u00a0responds\u00a0to new formats? What constitutes reaching results for you? More awareness?\u00a0or more active behavior across the different community groups?\"\n\nThis is a trying question. In my personal work using participatory methods and facilitation, I've found that audience members generally respond positively to these new formats, perhaps because it is visual and emotion-invoking. When producing the Digital stories and the Events with CCWs, we found people openly reacting to persons they see everyday and that they already know function within communities in a very different light. Suddenly we had a hall of persons speaking about CCWs, valuing them differently, wanting conversations, etc. Immediately support was forged. IN one meeting, I had a community member request the microphone and state <em>\"If i only saw this video 6 months ago my friend would be alive. He would know what these people do in the community and I would understand what my friend is going through. He died because the TB medication made him sick and he didn't want to be sick like that so he stopped\".\u00a0</em>\n\nFurther to your question, each commuinty in CT alone, nevermind SA, responds to these formats differently as they each have a varied social dynamic on their own. So a one-size-fits-all simply does not work in this context, hence us wanting to test out methods that are relative to the communities we work in. Additionally, commuities (esp townships) suffer from very different public health concerns, e.g. in Delft the issue we worked on was cardiovascular disease as a majority of persons are suffering from this wheres the community 2 km from my called Vrygrond TB is the main concern. Language variation is a big issue as its not homogenous.\n\nI agree with @CarolineM final comment. Generally, the response to these approaches have been favourable in very different settings. I've only briefly touched on that in the township environment. However, when presenting the Collaborative Videos and the Photovoice booklet to an academic audience at the University of Stellenbosch Medical Campus, Scientists were overall positive and approached me for additional information. It appeared that many are \"stuck\" when it comes to Engagement. In conclusion, all audiences that were exposed to the project products were excited and saw the value in the packaging of information in various forms, and the difference in direct participation with varying parties in the design of those products.\u00a0\n\nThe value for me lies in the intersection of these fields or knowledge bodies. and the relationships and collaborations forged. I am truly excited by this potentiality that remains on the fringes of studies and projects.\n\n@CarolineM \u00a0If you are based in CT and have the time, please do reach out to me. I'd love to have a conversation taking this further.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-11 14:01:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:05.875776", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 870, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 2.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73605, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13121, "post_number": 2, "raw": "if this pandemic is the dressed rehearsal....\nI'd just reserve judgement till we see in hindsight what happened.

Between you and @Noemi I feel inspired to test these methods more rigorously and I am actively seeking collaborations with persons interested in similar thematic areas.\u00a0\n\nWow @WinniePoncelet @NiekD . Unforunately I do not have a name of the Belgian researcher but I have been working on very similar themes in Cape Town when employed by a local org\u00a0. I focused very much on the Health Impact pillar of the organization, which adopted a participatory approach in its educational programmes. I managed 2 projects for the org that focused on Community Care Workers who were primarly the ground fighters for TB and HIV. We used Digital Story telling, Theatre and Photovoice as methods for engagement which were very successful in relaying lived experience for the sake of education. I'd be happy to share key learning. This video provides feedback from Community Care Works, and their reflections on the project:\u00a0<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/180156715\">https://vimeo.com/180156715 </a>\u00a0and this video features one Digital Story from a community resident:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy1PHfUMCQY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy1PHfUMCQY</a>.\n\nOur project on Cardiovascular disease, which I managed and lead all facilitation, used Photovoice as a methodology. It was phenomenal in highlighting illness, nutrition and general social dynamic in response to health. I'd be happy to share this as well as the Photovoice booklet. Please note that even though I managed the project the book was developed by the org that employed me. @NiekD &amp; @Scigrades grade, I think you may find this to be a interesting method that is participatory in all aspects of the design of the product. The following collaborative videos (a participatory method in itself in which a community develops their own video highlighting a specific issue/cause they've isolated as important to develop:\u00a0<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/186163072\">https://vimeo.com/186163072</a>\u00a0(Youth video focused on CVD) and\u00a0<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/190529779\">https://vimeo.com/190529779</a>\u00a0(video developed by youth, elder populaton and Scientists collectively). Note that the youth developed a collaborative video and the adult population of the participants developed the Photovoice publication. We aimed to explore CVD from different generation's perspectives using differing tools. The adult population are community members that have kids or grandkids and have to consider them when purchasing, consuming or disposing of food, whereas the youth group were youth aged 18 - 28 that do not have to consider others when purchasing, consuming or disposing of food. If anyone is interested I'd be keen to write up a post and post or email persons copies of the Photobook.\u00a0\n\nAnd finally @WinniePoncelet, as these methods are very new and often hard to track scientifically I've chosen to look at impact and direct KAP (knowledge, attitude and practice) changes. This is a near impossibility in its own. The way I've sought to study the efficacy of drama as a method was to\u00a0study variations of drama presentation including: deep characterization of characters; involving comedy in messages; shorter repetitive chanting or messaging in plays; plays in controlled environments to an invited, anticipating audience; pop up plays in local clinics to unsuspecting audiences. We interviewed persons with a set of questions focused on specific health messaging (i.e. TB and HIV focused) before and after plays.\n\nWe then interviewed a select number of persons 3-5 months post-performance to gauge retained knowledge. This allowed us insight into which theatrical mechanisms allows message recall. I am yet to publish this paper (if only we had 2 extra hours per day).I aim to take a similar approach with the Street Arts project, although the project adopts an organic, reactive and culturally-/community-sensitive approach and may prove hard to collate. We will not control the public health concern that will be focused on in each country that the project will be installed. Instead, we will allow for this to come directly from the community as we wish to work with issues, define the project and define the artform\u00a0in collaboration with community members. I wish to track this process, and treat this project as a prototype phase before scaling the project and inviting others as collaborators/partners in 2018.\u00a0\n\nI hope this provides you with some clarity.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me on nabroe@gmail.com if needed. If enough persons are interested in an entry focused on Photovoice as a method, I'd be glad to proceed.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-09 07:35:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:05.761496", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 796, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 2.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65039, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11021, "post_number": 34, "raw": "Ok will do so :).

Funded activities may include: promotion of societal engagement and solidarity, gathering of opinions, volunteering\n\nIt combines a few elements: artistic and cultural production; discussion about political issues and opening for new perspectives; international research and storytelling. \n\nThe rough outline would be:\n\n- 2-3 partners, besides us, in various countries: I would like to maybe work with an art space Gouvernement in Ghent, where I have friends and they do relevant work; Timisoara Civicultura and possibly Art Burst in Berlin (female curatorial collective) (or Experimentelle Zukunftlabor)\n\n- 1-year duration\n\n- Part 1: call for art residencies in the partner cities. The idea is to create European [conversation pieces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_piece) that deal with some burning issues that have both local and European implications in these places (or maybe elsewhere?). Artists stay for a month and develop these works, possibly in as open and inclusive, participatory way as possible\n\n- Part 2: these works now travel the country, or internationally, and are hosted in homes as part of a Library (needs a good name), inspired by NBK's [artothek](https://www.nbk.org/en/artothek/) - citizens from aroun the country or continent can access these works and host them for a short period, and part of the idea is that once the work arrives, we host an event around it - workshop, discussion - with experts, neighbours. A conversation about issues at hand, and how do we address and deal with those. \n\n- Part 3: we create a map of where these works have traveled, combined with stories that they sparked. This is where edgeryders' role kicks in mostly, and as a project manager.\n\nI would like to make this into a project that:\n- opens new ways for people to communicate in their private spheres and creates opportunities for new types of dialogues, new topics\n- democratizes access to art, but also emphasizes the educational aspect and value of art and the need to open it maybe even more radically to the public\n- has some kind of empowering and practical value to it - how to turn these encounters into action/recommendation/involvement? This is to be answered\n- it has to do with positive visions for the future\n\n- Part 4: how do we end this? A bigger exhibition? A gathering? A festival?", "created_at": "2019-07-29 11:06:27.772514", "updated_at": "2019-08-06 09:58:11.309729", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 433, "wiki": false, "reads": 30, "score": 191.0, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4265, 3, 4871, 145, 4945, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31968, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5952, "post_number": 27, "raw": "<b>Thanks!</b>\n\nFor some reason there is a duplicate sentence in the first paragraph: \"n.

The refugees crisis on the European borders added to the intense conversations I\u2019ve been having everyday with my friends lately, in real life or social media: the Hanau shootings, N-word usage, racism and lack of diversity and representation in art and on a daily basis in Germany and elsewhere, not to mention the corruption and disinterest suffocating my homeland. Hours later, I received an email from Noemi, with this job description. Somehow it made sense.\n\nI have no educational background in politics or social sciences, however I found my own way of activism through my artistic practice. All my political awareness and engagement is a learning process that started since coming to Germany for my MA in film with Wim Wenders at the HfbK Hamburg in 2011. Romanian-born and raised, I was now to find my own place in the world and connect with people that share my mindset, because being part of any kind of minority teaches you that you just cannot not be political. This has organically developed itself into an ongoing video project called *all the fridas, the beauty of rebellion (* https://allthefridas.com *)*. The aim was to bring together a community and ask questions, have genuine conversations and try to fill gaps that felt urgent, being proactive and personal in our practices. If you flip through it, you\u2019ll see that diversity and representation, as well as equality and kindness are basic and common features that connect us, all the people being involved in the project being friends that are mostly all politically active in their own personal way.\n\nNow living in Berlin as a freelance filmmaker, I\u2019m actively involved in the pre-production of our feature film debut and the *all the fridas* project is on hold. The urgency to address relevant issues is still there, just the form of the storytelling is changing -  we tell a story of a post-migrant family in Germany, basically addressing present migrant/ post-migrant human experiences in Europe and actually anywhere really - Cinema is our subtly political tool to react to what\u2019s currently going on, because the story only changes when we change the storytellers.\n\nI thought I\u2019d share this with you because it briefly sums up my drive, where I come from and where I\u2019m standing now on the issues that I feel that we have in common. Yes, it\u2019s a different way of activism, engagement and storytelling, but as long as our interest and curiosity and goals are alike, I would love to learn more about being a community manager in this new context. I\u2019m genuinely interested in this new kind of challenge and open to offer you my time and energy 8h hours a week for trying to speak out and bring people together and make a change (both in English and German).

For a project with such a strong social networking element, it is absolutely essential that people can interact without mediation nor delay: having someone translate everything we post would be not only impossibly expensive: it would dampen interaction and feedback, making the Edgeryders experience quite miserable. To get around this problem, we have agreed to encode some rules in the social bargain of Edgeryders. These:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>you are welcome to write in your own language. People can always get the gist of what you are writing by running it through Google Translate; we are building one-click translation into Edgeryders, to make it even easier.</li>\n\n<li>however, we encourage you to write in Euro English, the <em>lingua franca</em> the majority of young Europeans use when they move about. I wrote Euro English, and I specifically <em>don</em>'t mean the Queen's English: the former is an inclusive, connecting language that most youth speak enough to communicate, the latter is just another language, with its own solid grammar, pronunciation niceties and idiosyncrasies. There are many more people that speak Euro English, than people who speak the Queen's English.</li>\n\n<li>Edgeryders agree to be tolerant of each other's grammar or spelling mistakes. No one is allowed to look down at anyone else for this. We are not stupid or under-educated, we are just writing in a foreign language. Our effort to communicate deserves respect.</li>\n\n<li>Edgeryders who are native speakers of English are kindly requested to keep in mind they are part of a global community, and make their own effort to write in a simple, clear manner.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOne of the features we are planning to roll out as the project develops is an integration with Google Translate.

We also changed our name project in ResQ, we hope you'll like it\u00a0:)\n\nFollowing is our updated\u00a0project's\u00a0abstract\u00a0which includes some of the ideas mentioned in the previous comments.\n\nThank you!\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Our project in a tweet</strong>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nResQ is an app for physicians working in emergency contexts, that digitalise the health information of patients, so to make them easily available for colleagues.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Problem that our project\u00a0is willing to solve</strong>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nCurrently, the first aid provided to refugees arriving in Italy is effective in terms of solving the main health issues (healing of hurts due to the journey, or state of fever), but at the same time is not very efficient because of the superficial anamnestic research that physicians are compelled to make in such situations.\n\nIn addition, the information gathered about the health state of each patient, are stored in simple paper sheets, preventing a further the potential of a pervasive sharing that a digital format would easily allow.\n\nThe current way of working shows the following problems:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\tThe language barrier prevent a proper communication between the physician and the patient. Is usually delegated to the patients the duty of providing the accurate information about their health condition every visit.</li>\n\n<li>\tThe missing digitalization of the gathered health data and the consequent discontinuity of the healing process.</li>\n\n<li>\tThe limited precision of the anamnestic research due to the high number of patients and the short time available.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Final User, individuals and\u00a0community target</strong>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nResQ is conceived to ease the communication among physicians (involved in critical context such as temporary hospitals and reception centers) regarding the health state of foreigner patients who don\u2019t know the language of the hosting country. In this way, the tool is designed for physicians, but the main benefits will come for migrating patients whose this services is dedicated to.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Solution, brief description of the project</strong>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nResQ is a mobile management tool that improves the communication among healthcare workers (especially physicians, but also volunteers, nurses etc etc...), getting as a result the reduction of the language barrier that very often doesn\u2019t allow foreign patient to fully explain their symptoms or their own pathologies.\n\nThe personal pathological condition besides being a psychological kind of weight, for instance when a patient has to explain multiple times his/her condition to a series of different medical specialists, it could also lead to misinterpretation and diagnosis issues when there might be a language barrier.\n\nResQ is conceived to to be used mainly during the period in which the migrant still doesn\u2019t own a \u201cCodice Fiscale\u201d (personal unique fiscal code), but only a STP card (Straniero Temporaneamente Presente), that makes her/ him able to benefit from the main national healthcare services (for 12 months maximum).\n\nThe reception centers that provide the STP card and give the first medical assistance, have to deal with a very high number of people in a stressful situation that often lead to a superficial treatment.\n\nIn this way we designed an agile gathering data tool that saves time and in few minutes would be able to fulfill a complete health history of the patients. Also, the digitalization of such a document would make possible an extensive sharing with colleagues that later will take care of the same patient.\n\nTherefore the physician will have the chance to communicate autonomously among themselves without misunderstanding through the management tool.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Technologies we will adopt</strong>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe tool we are designing will be developed in order to be accessible from the main devices available on the market. Therefore we envision applications possibly developed in their native languages as Java or Android and Objective-C foe iOS ambients.\n\nEven though we believe a mobile tool might be most suitable solution for the specific usage context we are working on, we would like to provide also a multi-platform responsive app developed in HTML5.\n\nThe cloud service might be developed in NodeJS, with database in MongoDB and MySQL.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Website</strong>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nUnder construction.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Licence</strong>\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOpensource\n\n---\n\n<strong>What question\u00a0</strong>\n\nHow to help refugees in getting a more efficient healthcare service?\n\n<strong>What problem\u00a0</strong>\n\nLanguage barriers often lead to misunderstanding and psychological weight for foreigner patients.\n\n<strong>What solution\u00a0</strong>\n\nResQ is an app that connects physicians over common patients, providing a complete overlook to minimise language barriers.\n\n<a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/alessandro-contini\">@alessandro contini</a>\u00a0@silviad.ambrosio\u00a0<a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/chiarafrr\">@ChiaraFrr</a>\u00a0@Costantino\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-13 22:29:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:05.839924", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1033, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64764, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 11602, "post_number": 3, "raw": "That is really interesting.

Might sound obvious, but without it my life would be very different and not that exciting, I guess. I wouldn't be able to participate in thus mission, for example. But this is not the most important skill, of course. The most significant one for me is the <em>navigating skill,</em> in terms of navigating this swirling labyrinth of opportunities life displays in front of your eyes. Actually, at the very beginning, in front of your parents' eyes.\n\nMy parents are the ones I am very thankful for. Due to them, I was able to start learning <em>English </em>as a 4-year old child in a special kindergarten program. English is the skill which has been opening many doors to me in life since then, for instance, I am now studying in the USA for one semester in an exchange program. Another important skill my parents taught me is <em>self-dependency</em> meaning ability to take care of yourself and try to manage your life without asking your parents about the next step. As a teenager, I used to go to camps in summer where I had to stay for 3 to 6 weeks with other children. My parents and friends also taught me the <em>flexibility skill</em>, that is, \"try it and see if it works out for you\". I got to try a lot of things in my life from dancing and performing to Sociology. Each of the activities I engaged in took me further through the labyrinth and developed my personality. And now I am never afraid to try something new (unless it is life-threatening, of course).\n\nThere is another skill, which can hardly be expressed in one word. I have it thanks to my sociological education. It is a skill of looking around you without taking everything for granted, but questioning the reality and trying to interpret it in various ways.\n\n<em>The specific skills\u00a0</em>I use everyday are foreign languages, statistics, research, blogging, and what not!\n\nAll mentioned skills help in managing my life and work. They wouldn't be affordable if I didn't have a <em>learning </em>skill to learn them :) I am eager to learn new places, activities, people, opportunities, etc.\u00a0\n\n<em>Sharing </em>skill is the last but not least one. I am very grateful for being able to share my thoughts and experience here!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-29 01:57:14", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 11:26:18.468916", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 488, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64719, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 11649, "post_number": 2, "raw": "[quote=\"mark_19, post:1, topic:11649\"]\nmove up the Kardashev scale\n[/quote]\n\nWelcome Mark.

This was the general consensus at a recent Edgeryders webinar dedicated to a case study of the Sicily\u2019s Messina district \u201cstrange\u201d economy.\n\nEdgeryders co-founder Dr Alberto Cottica explained how despite the economic cycle initiated by the free trade and free movement of capital policies in the 1980s and 1990s, some people on the ground ignored the models and built small scale economies.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot we can learn from the Messina example\u201d - he said - \u201cfrom how it originated, from its projects and funding mechanisms and the capability of remaining independent.\u201d\n\n## The context\n\n<!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\nGiacomo Pinaffo of Fondazione Communit\u00e0 di Messina explains how the model worked, starting form the Sicilian context.\n\n\u201c...to quote data from 2018, the region had the highest unemployment rate in Italy. We're talking about more than 20%.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd 22.5% of families live below the relative poverty line and almost 20% of the economy is black (market) and illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition to this, there is the influence of the organized crime, the mafia.\u201d\n\n## The beginnings\n\n<!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\n\u201cPeople got tired of the local situation. Everything started in the beginning of the nineties, let's say, after the murders of the most important and most famous anti-mafia judges,\u201d Giacomo explained.\n\n\u201cThe citizens started to organise themselves autonomously in organisations and movements, trying to change things locally, with their own direct engagement.\u201d\n\n## The first project\n\n<!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\nA foundation was established and the group reached out to the Ministry representative, proposing to help in reintegrating patients with criminal record, detained in Messina\u2019s psychiatric facility, back into society.\n\n\u201cWe went to the minister and said, look, this jail costs a lot to the society because you are spending thousands of euros per year per person there. And you're not solving anything,\u201d Giacomo said.\n\n\u201cWe - the foundation - suggest a different possibility. If you provide us with a lump sum amount, which would be the sum of what you spend for one year per person, we assure you that we will be able to get them out of there and reintegrate them into society.\u201d\n\n***The State agreed to let 56 people from the institute be involved in the project.***\n\n<!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\n\u201cThe money the State would have spent for simply keeping the 56 persons in the facility was invested in building of photovoltaic plants, used by several public institutions and families, above all poor, living in Messina,\u201d Giacomo said.\n\n\u201cWe have proposed free plants and energy to the people who accepted to host the panels with the agreement that the public subsidies for them would be going directly to the Foundation. That created a guaranteed 20 years income flow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the people from the psychiatric institute were inserted in several cooperatives, agricultural, commercial, even the cooperative created to build the solar power plants.\u201d\n\nTheir employers paid a wage based on the work done while the Foundation, using the income from the subsidies, added the remaining sum needed to reach a fair wage. Meanwhile, to help their reintegration, the Foundation has organised a dedicated support program.\n\n## What can we learn from this?\n\n<!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\nAlberto highlighted:\n\n1. It used the passive public spending on the health care of very serious patients to **actively reintegrate** some of them into normal life.\n2. It managed to **reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in town.**\n3. It **spawned several new businesses** \u2013 landscaping and maintenance cooperatives for example and so forth.\n4. It **provided long time funding** of the Foundation.\n5. It introduced the Foundation as a **capable policy maker** on the local scene.\n6. Hundreds of businesses, households, schools and hospitals with solar panels installed by the Messina Foundation have become **friends and allies** of the Foundation.\n\n*\u201c**In English we would call these \u2018the relational goods\u2019. They are different from traditional idea of goods in economic theory, because their value lies in relationships\u201d - Alberto concluded.***\n\n## The second model - social housing\n\n<!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\n\u201cFreedom is the main objective of the Foundation. When we say development creates freedoms, we are referring to the Amartya Sen\u2019s capabilities approach - which means expanding the opportunity of choice for the people. The weakest obviously above all,\u201d Giacomo said.\n\n\u201cIn Messina, there are slum neighbourhoods. They were first built in 1908 after the earthquake and grew further after the bombings of the Second World War.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are very hard places to live in. The research we conducted discovered that the life expectancy of the people living there is seven years lower than the average of the rest of the city. It's controlled by crime. It's highly deprived.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese slums host around 2,500 families and on part of them, about 200 families, 700 persons, entered the project of social housing which we were asked to organise by the local Administration.\u201d\n\n\n <!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\n**The Foundation proposed three solutions to the people:**\n\n<!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\n1. Follow the main public program and relocate in a low rent house owned by the State.\n2. Enter one of the modern, energy efficient eco-buildings built on the sites freed by demolishing part of the slums.\n3. Buy a house taking a lump sum from the State which covered 80% of the price. The Foundation set up a microcredit institute which loaned the remaining 20% if needed. At the same time, the Foundation provided support and guidance through this process for the financially illiterate inhabitants of the slums.\n\n\u201cYou empowered them by giving them ownership of choice,\u201d Giacomo explained.\n\n <!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\n**\u201cLet's say (you change) the mind of one person, two, 200 people, 700 people. Then, step by step, the general approach in the local society starts to change.\u201d**\n\n## Can these models be replicated? Only if the systems evolve into networks\n\n<!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of networks, a lot of entities that are cooperating among themselves but keeping their identity, their position and their activity. They are independent and autonomous. They focus on specific issues and decide to work with other entities only where they see a gain for themselves,\u201d Giacomo explained.\n\n\u201cThe creation of a system starts from the entities capable of changing themselves too, by modifying their own structure, adapting to the specific context, getting closer to other entities and working together on a common project and a common dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the most interesting questions that arise is what makes local territorial systems capable of becoming self-organising entities,\u201d Giacomo said and added: \u201cThis is a point we would like to understand better. We would become able to see where and how can we cooperate with other territorial systems of the Mediterranean basin.\u201d\n\n## Let\u2019s break down some of the ways the Foundation operates\n\n**Subsidies vs stocks**\n\n<!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\nThe foundation buys stocks to maintain its financial independence.\n\n\u201cIf you always need to ask for external investment, both from public or private investors, you also have to comply with their requirements\u201d Giacomo said.\n\nThe co-operative structure does not have much appeal for the investors because of the nature of its governance. This limits the growth of many social enterprises.\n\n\u201cIt is one head one vote. It doesn't matter how much money you have invested, you have one head, you have one vote. This has an obvious impact on the capacity to collect equity. Investors are not so happy to invest a lot of money in these situations,\u201d Giacomo highlighted.\n\n***Stocks allow the Foundation to make a ten year strategic plan.***\n\n**Recognising that economy has a direction**\n\n<!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\n\u201cEconomy actually has directions. It is easy to recognise it in your case: it is producing more freedom for people,\u201d Alberto said, pointing out that the idea to innovate which considered only the economic growth rate and not its direction, is flawed.\n\n\u201cIn innovation policy\u2026 we should have missions. We should have the Apollo program, the decriminalisation of the economy and then we will create in practice more and better growth,\u201d he explained, making reference to economist Mariana Mazzucato.\n\n**Creating things that benefit all society**\n\n<!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\nThe foundation supported a local brewery which all but shut down offering the workers a buyout option.\n\n\u201cThere was the problem of keeping the people's jobs, but let us not forget that the brewery itself was a part of the local tradition.\u201d\n\n## Other models, discussions and thoughts from our breakout sessions\n\n<!-- @page { margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } -->\n\n**The open discussion touched the differences and similarities between Sicily and Sweden, the Netherlands experience, the circular economy, the long term sustainability.**\n\nIdeas and examples of positive outcome from cooperative work were mentioned, such as:\n\n* **The Cleveland model** and the **Evergreen Cooperative Initiative**\n* **The Stoneybatter Festival** in Northwest Dublin\n* Public housing model in Vienna\n\n## If you have any further thoughts on how we can restructure economies or examples you would like to highlight.

Here's a proposal how that could be achieved, and I think it could be worth a try during our next two big projects in the next few years.\n\nIt starts from the observation that, for the intellectually minded people in the Edgeryders crowd, Facebook still serves these functions:\n\n1. **A medium of contact with friends and acquaintances.** That's covered by Facebook Messenger mostly, and we don't aim to replace that. Messenger is still bad, but at least separate enough from the rest of Facebook that we can get rid of the rest. (People who want to get rid of the Facebook website can empty their feed there by unfollowing every single person while keeping the account, and then keep using [messenger.com](https://www.messenger.com/) and / or the Messenger app.)\n\n2. **A curated feed of articles and news.** Newspapers had this function of curation before, until Facebook's feed algorithm made everyone take on that role for their friends (without payment). And worse, a lot of newspapers now serve either bad content (clickbait) instead of journalism or they hide behind a paywall, or even do _both_ (like many German ones). That means newspapers cannot serve an interesting curated selection of information to intellectually minded people, who will often rather rely on an eclectic mix of articles from around the web, curated by their Facebook friends, or maybe by their sub-reddit.\n\nThat second function is what we could replace with the Edgeryders platform, and as an effect increase the amount of time people spend around here by a large amount. It could work as follows:\n\nWe would employ 1-2 content curators (let's say, from Nepal :) ), potentially paid with project money for community management or engagement. They take 2-4 hours each per day to curate a feed of content in a dedicated category here on Edgeryders. Since Edgeryders is (in a weird way) a homogenous community, the same kind of feed will be interesting for everyone here. It has to be a lot, though. Probably \u2265100 links per day, so people can easily spend an hour per day to go through the articles they find interesting from it. For the presentation format, we'd chose something like that of [our current company blog](/tags/blog?view=topic-preview). So each link would have a proper preview in the feed, and users also have the option to visit the Discourse topic in order to comment / discuss with others about that link.\n\nThe content curators will need some external input, of course. But if 10 here on Edgeryders would support the scheme by forwarding interesting links and tips to the curators, we could get it started. And finally make Edgeryders a place to hang out as well, not just to work \u2026\n\nI know that @johncoate likes to post interesting links to Campfire quite often.

In fact there are countless possible way to design the same content, but as we are all aware, time and budget allow us only a certain number of feasible solutions.\n> \n> As I\u2019ve explained, **this is a style exploration,** done, as agreed upon over the phone, to understand the clients's tastes in matter of visual treatment of the content. \n> \n> **This is not a concept proposal. The illustrations you see here, are the work of art of other professional illustrators. They are not for sale and they are not a concept proposal. They are only examples of what the final outcome could look like, if the clients want to have an illustration as a solution.** Just FYI, any of these illustration examples would probably cost easily \u00a32000/\u00a33000 if commissioned to these illustrators.

To by\u0142y jakie\u015b pojedyncze aktywno\u015bci w zale\u017cno\u015bci od potrzeby. Brakowa\u0142o mi narz\u0119dzi, warsztatu do tego i dlatego porusza\u0142em si\u0119 po omacku, wi\u0119c poszed\u0142em do Szko\u0142y Praw Cz\u0142owieka prowadzonej przez Helsi\u0144sk\u0105 Fundacj\u0119 Praw Cz\u0142owieka. Ona ju\u017c wtedy by\u0142a mocno rozpoznawalna i wydawa\u0142o mi si\u0119, \u017ce jak j\u0105 przejd\u0119, naucz\u0119 si\u0119 czego\u015b od nich i poznam osoby, kt\u00f3re to robi\u0105 w sposob du\u017co bardziej zorganizowany czy zinstytucjonalizowany \u2013 mo\u017ce nawi\u0105\u017cemy jak\u0105\u015b wsp\u00f3\u0142prac\u0119. Ile mog\u0142em, wyci\u0105gn\u0105\u0142em z tego. By\u0142em na wszystkich zaj\u0119ciach. Przed egzaminem wzi\u0105\u0142em tydzie\u0144 urlopu i przeczyta\u0142em wszystkie materia\u0142y dane nam na zaj\u0119ciach i wyszukane. Bez strachu poszed\u0142em do prof. Rzepli\u0144skiego, nie czekaj\u0105c w kolejce. To chyba by\u0142o dobre posuni\u0119cie, bo dosta\u0142em od Danuty Przywary propozycj\u0119, \u017ceby si\u0119 do nich zapisa\u0107. Chcieli mnie wys\u0142a\u0107 gdzie\u015b na wsch\u00f3d, \u017ceby nie\u015b\u0107 kaganek o\u015bwiaty prawocz\u0142owieczej. Odm\u00f3wi\u0142em. Mam tak\u0105 tendencj\u0119, \u017ce w wi\u0119kszo\u015bci spraw, kt\u00f3re ludzie mi proponuj\u0105, odmawiam. Mia\u0142em wtedy tak\u0105 prac\u0119 zawodow\u0105, \u017ce absolutnie nie da\u0142o si\u0119 wyrwa\u0107. By\u0142em \u017co\u0142nierzem zawodowym. Wzi\u0119li mnie do wojska przymusowo na studiach \u2013 na przeszkolenie absolwent\u00f3w. Dosta\u0142em dwie oferty, obydwie by\u0142y atrakcyjne. Z jednej nie mog\u0142em skorzysta\u0107 z powod\u00f3w rodzinnnych. Druga by\u0142a naprawd\u0119 rewelacyjna. Zawsze chcia\u0142em pracowa\u0107 dla pa\u0144stwa, spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa. Nigdy nie mia\u0142em problemu z pe\u0142nieniem jakiej\u015b s\u0142u\u017cby. Atrakcyjno\u015b\u0107 tej pracy polega\u0142a na tym: zawarli ze mn\u0105 d\u017centelme\u0144skie porozumienie, \u017ce pozwol\u0105 mi si\u0119 spokojnie prawniczo rozwija\u0107. Przez bardzo d\u0142ugi okres dotrzymywali s\u0142owa. To si\u0119 potem zmieni\u0142o, ale to za wiele lat. W wojsku by\u0142em przez 18 lat. Na przeszkoleniu by\u0142em w Poznaniu, Krakowie, a potem w Lublinie. A s\u0142u\u017cy\u0142em w D\u0119blinie i w Warszawie. Odszed\u0142em jako pu\u0142kownik, bo wyczerpa\u0142y si\u0119 moje pok\u0142ady cierpliwo\u015bci. Z jednej strony dlatego, \u017ce w wojsku - w spos\u00f3b dla mnie nie do zaakceptowania - robi si\u0119 karier\u0119 w pejoratywnym znaczeniu tego s\u0142owa. Nie jest tak, \u017ce ludzie awansuj\u0105, bo s\u0105 ambitni i ci\u0119\u017cko pracuj\u0105, \u017ceby co\u015b osi\u0105gn\u0105\u0107, tylko s\u0105 ambitni chorobliwie i awansuj\u0105, \u017ceby mie\u0107 kas\u0119, presti\u017c, mniej pracy. W wojsku takie osoby, kt\u00f3re maj\u0105 plecy, znajomo\u015bci, rodzin\u0119, kt\u00f3rzy potrafi\u0105 pi\u0107 z kolegami na um\u00f3r i udzielaj\u0105 si\u0119 towarzysko, nawet jak s\u0105 kompletnie bez predyspozycji do wojska, to tam robi\u0105 karier\u0119.\n\nFachowo taka s\u0142u\u017cba nazywa si\u0119 stosunkiem s\u0142u\u017cbowym typu administracyjnego. To nie jest umowa o prac\u0119. Powo\u0142anie do wojska niczym szczeg\u00f3lnym si\u0119 nie r\u00f3\u017cni. Mog\u0105 si\u0119 ciebie pozby\u0107 w ka\u017cdej chwili i mo\u017cesz te\u017c odej\u015b\u0107 w ka\u017cdej chwili. Pr\u00f3bowa\u0142em robi\u0107 du\u017co r\u00f3\u017cnych rzeczy, b\u0119d\u0105c w wojsku. To by\u0142o ju\u017c po Szkole Praw Cz\u0142owieka. Na jednym ze zjazd\u00f3w absolwent\u00f3w pozna\u0142em absolwenta starszego rocznika. Zakolegowali\u015bmy si\u0119. Interesowa\u0142o nas prawo humanitarne. On pozna\u0142 mnie z kolei ze swoim koleg\u0105 ze studi\u00f3w, kt\u00f3ry by\u0142 mocno zaanga\u017cowany w prawo humanitarne te\u017c naukowo. Nawi\u0105zali\u015bmy na tyle \u015bcis\u0142\u0105 wsp\u00f3\u0142prac\u0119, \u017ce pracowa\u0142em jako wolontariusz w O\u015brodku Praw Cz\u0142owieka Uniwersytetu Jagiello\u0144skiego *(dalej: UJ* ). Tak na pocz\u0105tku si\u0119 nazywa\u0142, a potem rozwin\u0119li\u015bmy dzia\u0142k\u0119 humanitarn\u0105 do tego stopnia, \u017ce nawet zmieni\u0142 nazw\u0119 na: \u201eO\u015brodek Mi\u0119dzynarodowego Prawa Konflikt\u00f3w Zbrojnych i Praw Cz\u0142owieka\u201d. Zrobili\u015bmy bardzo du\u017co rzeczy. Marcin by\u0142 przewodnicz\u0105cym albo wiceprzewodnicz\u0105cym komisji od prawa humanitarnego przy Polskim Czerwonym Krzy\u017cu. Piotrek kilka razy wyjecha\u0142 na wojn\u0119 do Afganistanu czy Iraku jako cywil \u2013 specjalista ds. prawa humanitarnego. Wydali\u015bmy pierwszy podr\u0119cznik do prawa humanitarnego. By\u0142o tego kilkaset sztuk. Do tego stopnia to by\u0142a po\u017c\u0105dana pozycja, \u017ce rozesz\u0142a si\u0119 w mgnieniu oka. Wzi\u0105\u0142em ze sob\u0105 pude\u0142ko tych ksi\u0105\u017cek do Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego na jak\u0105\u015b konferencj\u0119 zwi\u0105zan\u0105 z tym tematem. Wydarli mi je z tego pude\u0142ka, ka\u017cdy je chcia\u0142. To by\u0142o naprawd\u0119 bardzo udane wydawnictwo. Potem robili\u015bmy mn\u00f3stwo innych rzeczy: organizowa\u0142li\u015bmy konferencje dla student\u00f3w i doktorant\u00f3w, kursy dla \u017co\u0142nierzy na jednej z uczelni wojskowych, kt\u00f3re bardzo im si\u0119 podoba\u0142y, bo by\u0142y z du\u017c\u0105 cz\u0119\u015bci\u0105 aktywnych zaj\u0119\u0107. To nie by\u0142o siedzenie w \u0142awkach. Nawet genera\u0142owie uczestniczyli w tych kursach i bardzo sobie je chwalili. Zrobili\u015bmy te\u017c jaki\u015b projekt unijny razem. Na bazie naszej wsp\u00f3\u0142pracy zacz\u0105\u0142em studia doktoranckie na UJ. Potem wsp\u00f3\u0142praca w spos\u00f3b naturalny rozpierzch\u0142a si\u0119. Sko\u0144czy\u0142em studia, ale doktoratu nigdy nie obroni\u0142em, bo nie mam czasu go napisa\u0107. Potem doszed\u0142em do wniosku, \u017ce nie ma to sensu, bo to nie podnosi mojej pozycji zawodowej w Polsce w \u017caden spos\u00f3b, a dydaktyka nie jest czym\u015b, co by mi si\u0119 podoba\u0142o. Chocia\u017c z przykro\u015bci\u0105 stwierdzam, \u017ce od czasu do czasu si\u0119 tym zajmuj\u0119. Nie mia\u0142em jednocze\u015bnie \u017cadnej szansy na dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 naukow\u0105, a to mnie najbardziej interesowa\u0142o. Poniewa\u017c nie by\u0142o takiej szansy, da\u0142em sobie spok\u00f3j. Zmieniam troch\u0119 to podej\u015bcie pod wp\u0142ywem ostatniej swojej dzia\u0142alno\u015bci spo\u0142eczno \u2013 politycznej. Powoli dochodz\u0119 do wniosku i utwierdzam si\u0119 w przekonaniu \u2013 nie wiem czy s\u0142usznie \u2013 \u017ce w swoim \u017cyciu zawodowym nieproporcjonalnie du\u017co czasu po\u015bwi\u0119ca\u0142em pracy typowo zarobkowej, a za ma\u0142o pracy spo\u0142ecznej. I my\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce tak samo mo\u017cna powiedzie\u0107 o dziesi\u0105tkach tysi\u0119cy polskich prawnik\u00f3w, dziennikarzy, politolog\u00f3w, ekonomist\u00f3w itd. - ludzi z mojego pokolenia. My\u015bmy nie wyedukowali spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa i dlatego ono troch\u0119 przypomina spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo angielskie. Je\u015bli w og\u00f3le pracuj\u0119, to w drodze z pracy kupi\u0119 sobie piwo i chipsy, a przez reszt\u0119 dnia siadam z piwem i pilotem w r\u0119ku przed telewizorem. I tak wygl\u0105da moje zainteresowanie \u015bwiatem, mimo \u017ce mo\u017cliwo\u015bci rozwoju osobistego s\u0105 w tej chwili praktycznie nieograniczone, nawet je\u015bli kto\u015b nie jest maj\u0119tny. To jest jedna z najwi\u0119kszych pora\u017cek mojego pokolenia. Dlatego wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce gdybym wr\u00f3ci\u0142 do tego doktoratu i odnowi\u0142 kontaktu uczelniane, mo\u017ce jako\u015b uda\u0142oby si\u0119 zwi\u0119kszy\u0107 starania i co\u015b porobi\u0107.\n\nTym bardziej, \u017ce ostatnio coraz wi\u0119cej w tym zakresie zacz\u0105\u0142em robi\u0107: uczestnicz\u0119 w tygodniach konstytucyjnych, nawet komercyjnie prowadz\u0119 zaj\u0119cia o prawie w ma\u0142ych miejscowo\u015bciach. Wida\u0107 tam zainteresowanie, mimo \u017ce prowadz\u0119 zaj\u0119cia w bran\u017cy medycznej. To s\u0105 ludzie o wysokim stopniu wykszta\u0142cenia, o du\u017cej \u015bwiadomo\u015bci zawodowej i nie tylko. Najbardziej liczebn\u0105 grup\u0105 s\u0105 piel\u0119gniarki, ale pracuj\u0119 te\u017c z innymi grupami: fizjoterapeutami, ratownikami medycznymi, po\u0142o\u017cnymi. By\u0107 mo\u017ce to pozwoli mi na jak\u0105\u015b dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 dydaktyczn\u0105. Wola\u0142bym prowadzi\u0107 dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 naukow\u0105, a du\u017co lepiej czuj\u0119 si\u0119 w akcyjnej dzia\u0142alno\u015bci spo\u0142ecznej. Od jakiego\u015b czasu jestem w organizacji prawocz\u0142owieczej. Na razie niczego tam dla siebie nie znalaz\u0142em. Moja obecno\u015b\u0107 sprowadza si\u0119 do p\u0142acenia sk\u0142adek. Czasami zrobi\u0119 co\u015b dla niej takiego prawniczego. W takich dzia\u0142aniach, jakie ona prowadzi na co dzie\u0144, p\u00f3ki co nie odnajdu\u0119 si\u0119. Na razie nie mam na nie czasu. Z drugiej strony nie mam wiedzy z zakresu przewa\u017caj\u0105cej dzia\u0142alno\u015bci, czyli migrant\u00f3w z Ukrainy.\n\nOstatnio wyst\u0105pi\u0142a du\u017ca rewolucja w Iustiti lubelskiej \u2013 stowarzyszeniu s\u0119dzi\u00f3w. Zmieni\u0142y si\u0119 osoby we w\u0142adzach. Co\u015b tam si\u0119 powoli rozkr\u0119ca. Przede wszystkim wsp\u00f3lnymi si\u0142ami \u2013 radcowsko \u2013 adwokacko \u2013 s\u0119dziowskimi i uczelnianymi \u2013 zrobili\u015bmy przedstawienie procesu Szewczyka Dratewki. Zrobili\u015bmy ju\u017c pierwsz\u0105 kafejk\u0119 prawn\u0105 i b\u0119d\u0105 one kontynuowane. Uda\u0142o si\u0119 znale\u017a\u0107 lokalizcj\u0119. To by\u0142o najtrudniejsze w Lublinie. Ani knajpy nie chcia\u0142y si\u0119 zgodzi\u0107 ani miejskie instytucje kultury. Tylko ze wzgl\u0119du na znajomo\u015b\u0107 z szefem lokalu udost\u0119pniono nam miejsce, ale poszukiwania zaj\u0119\u0142y dobre trzy miesi\u0105ce. M\u00f3wiono nam po prostu, \u017ce w tym celu nie udost\u0119pni\u0105 sali. To jest taka dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 stricte prawnicza. Chodzi przede wszystkim o s\u0119dzi\u00f3w, \u017ceby pokazali troch\u0119 ludzkiego oblicza i zacz\u0119li wychodzi\u0107 do ludzi. Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce nasze dzia\u0142ania to dobry kierunek. To jest mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 spotkania ka\u017cdego cz\u0142owieka z przedstawicielami r\u00f3\u017cnych zawod\u00f3w prawniczych i porozmawiania o praktycznych aspektach \u017cycia. Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce to taka dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107, kt\u00f3rej nie wolno zaniedba\u0107 i nale\u017cy j\u0105 rozwija\u0107. Chcieli\u015bmy pojecha\u0107 na dni Jaros\u0142awia, zacz\u0119li\u015bmy si\u0119 przygotowywa\u0107, ale burmistrz Jaros\u0142awia nam odm\u00f3wi\u0142. Podejrzewam, \u017ce to jest po prostu strach przed w\u0142adz\u0105 centraln\u0105. Iustitia jest przeciwko temu wszystkiemu, co si\u0119 robi jako tzw. reforma wymiaru sprawiedliwo\u015bci: od Trybuna\u0142u, przez S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy po Krajow\u0105 Rad\u0119 S\u0105downictwa. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce przez obecn\u0105 w\u0142adz\u0119 s\u0105 bardzo \u017ale postrzegani.\n\n**Potrzeba nacisku spo\u0142ecznego**\nZdecydowanie jako\u015b\u0107 \u017cycia nam si\u0119 pogarsza. Wida\u0107 to w por\u00f3wnaniu z tym jak szybko rozwijaj\u0105 si\u0119 miasta na zachodzie Polski. Jedyne, co mo\u017ce si\u0119 zmieni\u0107, to \u015bwiadomo\u015b\u0107 ludzi. Bez wzgl\u0119du na to kto jest i b\u0119dzie prezydentem miasta, i jaka b\u0119dzie rada miejska, brakuje bie\u017c\u0105cego i sta\u0142ego nacisku spo\u0142ecznego, \u017ceby cokolwiek si\u0119 zmieni\u0142o. Ludzie musz\u0105 mie\u0107 skuteczne instrumenty pozwalaj\u0105ce mieszka\u0144com rzeczywi\u015bcie wsp\u00f3\u0142decydowa\u0107 o tym, co si\u0119 dzieje na ich osiedlach. Takich instrument\u00f3w ani w polskim prawie ani w polskiej kulturze nie ma. Nie ma takiej mo\u017cliwo\u015bci, \u017ceby kto\u015b kto dzier\u017cy w\u0142adz\u0119, t\u0105 w\u0142adz\u0105 si\u0119 podzieli\u0142. Nie b\u0119dzie tak, \u017ce w parlamencie wys\u0142uchania publiczne b\u0119d\u0105 wtedy, gdy tylko obywatele sobie tego za\u017cycz\u0105 albo odb\u0119d\u0105 si\u0119 obowi\u0105zkowe konsultacje spo\u0142eczne r\u00f3\u017cnych projekt\u00f3w, ograniczaj\u0105ce dyskrecjonaln\u0105 w\u0142adz\u0119 Sejmu. On tego nie chce. Tak samo lokalnie \u2013 nikt nie wprowadzi skutecznych instrument\u00f3w demokracji bezpo\u015bredniej, bo zawodowi politycy nie chc\u0105 si\u0119 w\u0142adz\u0105 dzieli\u0107. Sami z siebie tego nie zrobi\u0105. To musi by\u0107 oddzielny ruch spo\u0142eczny, kt\u00f3ry to wymusi. S\u0105 takie okoliczno\u015bci, kt\u00f3re pobudzaj\u0105 spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo. Tak jak czytam r\u00f3\u017cne ksi\u0105\u017cki o ruchach spo\u0142ecznych, to w Polsce jednak musi si\u0119 przela\u0107 czara goyczy. U nas du\u017ce ruchy by\u0142y g\u0142\u00f3wnie robotnicze itd. Dop\u00f3ki gospodarka jest w jakiej\u015b kondycji, nikt si\u0119 nie b\u0119dzie przejmowa\u0142. W Polsce przez ca\u0142y czas gospodarka jest w jakiej\u015b kondycji.\n\n**Etos pracy**\nWchodzi\u0142em na rynek pracy w okresie prze\u0142omu. Pierwsz\u0105 dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 zacz\u0105\u0142em jeszcze na studiach, a do pierwszej pracy poszed\u0142em w klasie maturalnej. Zawsze mnie ci\u0105gnie\u0142o do tego, \u017ceby zobaczy\u0107 jak wygl\u0105da \u015bwiat z drugiej strony. Dla nas \u2013 ca\u0142ego mojego pokolenia \u2013 w przeciwie\u0144stwie do ludzi na Zachodzie, praca 60-70 godz. w tygodni to nic nadzwyczajnego. Nikt si\u0119 nigdy nie upomina\u0142 o jakie\u015b urlopy, nadgodziny czy zwolnienia. Ja na zwolnieniu lekarskiem by\u0142em raz: 10 dni po operacji onkologicznej, przez 30 lat pracy. Jest mn\u00f3stwo ludzi takich jak ja, dlatego pokolenie tych 40-50 latk\u00f3w zapewnia temu spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwu dobrobyt. Tylko on nie b\u0119dzie trwa\u0142 wiecznie. Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce kolejne pokolenia ju\u017c tak o tym nie my\u015bl\u0105. Wszczepiono nam, \u017ceby\u015bmy tak pracowali, bo od pocz\u0105tku nam m\u00f3wiono, \u017ce to jest historyczny moment, prze\u0142om, kiedy jak nie teraz. By\u0142o takie s\u0142ynne powiedzenie lat 90tych: \u201eTeraz ju\u017c mo\u017cemy wzi\u0105\u0107 sprawy we w\u0142asne r\u0119ce\u201d. No wi\u0119c wszyscy brali swoje sprawy we w\u0142asne r\u0119ce: zak\u0142adali jakie\u015b dzia\u0142alno\u015bci gospodarcze, pracowali na 3-4 etaty jednocze\u015bnie. Bardzo du\u017co z tego zosta\u0142o, bo jak spotykam w swojej pracy zawodowej ludzi, na r\u00f3\u017cnych zakr\u0119tach \u017cyciowych, to s\u0105 bardzo cz\u0119sto osoby, kt\u00f3re s\u0105 zapracowane na maksa i zawsze pracowa\u0142y na wi\u0119cej ni\u017c jeden etat. Nawet je\u015bli siedzia\u0142y na etacie, to mia\u0142y swoje gospodarstwo rolne albo pracowa\u0142y u te\u015bci\u00f3w na gospodarstwie albo mia\u0142y swoj\u0105 drobn\u0105 dzia\u0142ano\u015b\u0107 typu sklep we wsi. To si\u0119 wi\u0105\u017ce ze wstawaniem o 2-3 rano, \u017ceby pojecha\u0107 po \u015bwie\u017ce warzywa czy po chleb. Teraz jeste\u015bmy w takim okresie, \u017ce zr\u00f3wna\u0142a si\u0119 ilo\u015b\u0107 emerytur dla os\u00f3b ze starymi emeryturami \u2013 pozosta\u0142o\u015bci jeszcze po PRL ( *przyp* . *Polska Republika Ludowa* ) z emeryturami os\u00f3b urodzonymi po 1948 roku. Statystycznie emerytura wg starego systemu, czyli os\u00f3b urodzonych do 31 grudnia 1948 r., wynosi ponad 4 tys. z\u0142, a bez emerytur g\u00f3rniczych \u2013 3 600 \u2013 3 800 z\u0142. A w nowym systemie \u015brednia emerytura wynosi 2 100 z\u0142. Dla os\u00f3b, kt\u00f3re b\u0119d\u0105 w nowym systemie emerytalnym prorokuje si\u0119, \u017ce ich emerytura b\u0119dzie wynosi\u0142a maksymalnie 30% przeci\u0119tnego wynagrodzenia, czyli dzisiaj w Polsce to b\u0119dzie niewiele ponad 1 000 z\u0142 netto. To nie jest satysfakcjonuj\u0105ce. Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce to jeden z najistotniejszych problem\u00f3w do rozwi\u0105zania i sprzyjaj\u0105cych populizmowi. Polska jest krajem o najwi\u0119kszych r\u00f3\u017cnicach maj\u0105tkowych w Europie. Nie jestem socjalist\u0105, mo\u017ce troch\u0119 lewakiem, ale raczej centroliberalne mam pogl\u0105dy. Natomiast mam pewn\u0105 wra\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 spo\u0142eczn\u0105 i du\u017c\u0105 wag\u0119 w swoich pogl\u0105dach po\u015bwi\u0119cam sprawom spo\u0142ecznym. Jest sporo takich rzeczy, kt\u00f3re dla przeci\u0119tnych ludzi s\u0105 bardzo istotne. Emerytury s\u0105 jedn\u0105 z istotniejszych. Tak samo zaspokojenie potrzeb mieszkaniowych jest jedn\u0105 z takich kwestii. W Polsce nie ma r\u00f3wnomiernego rozk\u0142adania uwagi pomi\u0119dzy r\u00f3\u017cne cz\u0119\u015bci kraju, w kt\u00f3rych s\u0105 takie same istotne problemy spo\u0142eczne. Ca\u0142y czas m\u00f3wi si\u0119 o reprywatyzacji w Warszawie, ale poza Warszaw\u0105 o reprywatyzacji nikt nie s\u0142ysza\u0142. Mo\u017ce w takich du\u017cych miastach jak Krak\u00f3w. Kto\u015b tam mo\u017ce przeb\u0105kiwa\u0142 na ten temat mi\u0119dzy s\u0142owami, ale nie oszukujmy si\u0119 \u2013 przecie\u017c w Lublinie takie zjawisko r\u00f3wnie\u017c wyst\u0119puje. Nie na tak\u0105 skal\u0119, ale wyst\u0119puje. Ono nie jest mniej patologiczne, tylko na mniejsz\u0105 skal\u0119, bo jest mniej kamienic, mniej mieszka\u0144c\u00f3w, po prostu mniejsze miasto. I nikt w zwi\u0105zku z tym tak bardzo si\u0119 tym nie interesuje, ale indywidualne przypadki, konkretne osoby, prze\u017cywaj\u0105 to tak samo jak te w Warszawie. To s\u0105 \u017cyciowe tragedie, \u017cyciowe problemy, wcale nie mniejsze ni\u017c w stolicy. Natomiast p\u0142aca minimalna to zagadnienie mocno makroekonomiczne. W normalnej gospodarce minimalna p\u0142aca powinna uwzgl\u0119dnia\u0107 ca\u0142y szereg czynnik\u00f3w o charakterze og\u00f3lnogospodarczym. U nas w pa\u0144stwie jest ona ustalana sztywno, centralnie. Mo\u017cna sobie wyobrazi\u0107 inne rozwi\u0105zania. W wi\u0119kszo\u015bci sytuacji by\u0142o jednak tak, \u017ce decyduj\u0105cym g\u0142osem - z powodu kulej\u0105cego od zawsze dialogu tr\u00f3jstronnego - zawsze s\u0142uchano tylko jednej strony, czyli pracodawc\u00f3w, dlatego p\u0142ace s\u0105 na bardzo niskim poziomie. Sam znam takie osoby, kt\u00f3re szczyc\u0105 si\u0119 tym, \u017ce p\u0142ac\u0105 jak najmniej swoim pracownikom. Ludzie pracuj\u0105 u nich za minimalne wynagrodzenie, bo za tyle musz\u0105. Ewentualnie daj\u0105 dodatkowe pieni\u0105dze ludziom pod sto\u0142em. To jest praktyka na Lubelszczy\u017anie bardzo \u017cywa. Bardzo du\u017co ludzi tak pracuje. Natomiast oni sami \u017cyj\u0105 na poziomie mocno magnackim. Dorobienie si\u0119 w Polsce kosztem innych jest mo\u017cliwe z dw\u00f3ch najwa\u017cniejszych powod\u00f3w. Po pierwsze, Polacy s\u0105 bardzo s\u0142abo wykszta\u0142ceni. Nie m\u00f3wi\u0119 o tym, \u017ce nie sko\u0144czyli jakiej\u015b szko\u0142y, tylko ta szko\u0142a, kt\u00f3r\u0105 si\u0119 w Polsce ko\u0144czy, w og\u00f3le nie przygotowuje ludzi do \u017cycia: takiego doros\u0142ego, \u015bwiadomego. W wyniku czego przeci\u0119tny polski pracownik nie ma umiej\u0119tno\u015bci negocjacji swoich warunk\u00f3w zatrudnienia. Z tym si\u0119 wi\u0105\u017ce chocia\u017cby \u015bwiadomo\u015b\u0107 swojej warto\u015bci na rynku pracy. Poza brakiem wykszta\u0142cenia, drugim czynnikiem, kt\u00f3ry pozwala na takie traktowanie pracownik\u00f3w, jest brak mobilno\u015bci. Ludzie u nas s\u0105 jak w czasach pa\u0144szczyzny przywi\u0105zani do ziemi. Sami siebie tak traktuj\u0105. Jak osob\u0119, kt\u00f3ra nie pojedzie, nie poszuka lepszej pracy, nosa nie wy\u015bciubi ze swojej wsi. To jest do tego stopnia problem, te\u017c dla gospodarki w skali makro moim zdaniem, \u017ce ten czynnik hamuje w og\u00f3le aktywizacj\u0119 zawodow\u0105. Cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 os\u00f3b posz\u0142aby do pracy, ale w miejscu, w kt\u00f3rym stoi ich cha\u0142upa z dziada pradziada, a poniewa\u017c takiej pracy nie ma, s\u0105 bezrobotnymi ca\u0142e \u017cycie.\n\nMoim zdaniem nie ma r\u00f3\u017cnic co do koszt\u00f3w \u017cycia w r\u00f3\u017cnych cz\u0119\u015bciach kraju. Mam rodzin\u0119 w Warszawie, cz\u0119sto jestem w Warszawie, pracuj\u0119 tam. Nie wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce \u017ceby zrobi\u0107 zakupy codzienne, trzeba wyda\u0107 wi\u0119cej, a nawet niekiedy mniej. Nie wiem dlaczego s\u0105 takie r\u00f3\u017cnice w zarobkach. Mo\u017ce dlatego, \u017ce \u017cycie w Warszawie wygl\u0105da inaczej, wi\u0119cej wydaje si\u0119 us\u0142ugi. Na pewno cz\u0119\u015bciej korzysta si\u0119 z us\u0142ug. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce to bierze si\u0119 pod uwag\u0119. Bierze si\u0119 pod uwag\u0119 te\u017c to, \u017ce w wi\u0119kszym mie\u015bcie zarobisz wi\u0119cej. W zwi\u0105zku z czym mo\u017cesz zach\u0119ci\u0107 pracownika - dobrego, perpektywicznego - z mniejszego o\u015brodka, \u017ceby przyjecha\u0142 pracowa\u0107 u ciebie. Takiego, kt\u00f3rego u siebie \u2013 w wydojonym z pracownik\u00f3w rynku pracy - ju\u017c nie znajdziesz. Bardzo istotne moim zdaniem jest to, \u017ce s\u0105 takie regiony w Polsce \u2013 jak Lubelszczyzna \u2013 gdzie nie ma kompletnie dobrych miejsc pracy. W tym sensie, \u017ce s\u0105 to inne us\u0142ugi ni\u017c najta\u0144sze, typu call center b\u0105d\u017a po prostu praca w urz\u0119dach. W Lublinie nie ma innej pracy: kilka uczelni, szk\u00f3\u0142, urz\u0119d\u00f3w, szpitali. Je\u015bli s\u0105 jacy\u015b prywatni pracodawcy, to cz\u0119\u015bciowo ci, o kt\u00f3rych m\u00f3wi\u0142em \u2013 wyzyskuj\u0105cy, kt\u00f3rzy wi\u0119cej ni\u017c minimaln\u0105 stawk\u0119, p\u0142ac\u0105 tylko pod sto\u0142em, \u201ena czarno\u201d, a du\u017cych pracodawc\u00f3w nie ma wcale. Natomiast \u015bredni pracodawcy, traktuj\u0105cy swoich pracownik\u00f3w inaczej ni\u017c jako si\u0142\u0119 robocz\u0105 do wydojenia, to incydentalne przypadki. Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce to kwestia polityki centralnej. Je\u017celi to si\u0119 nie zmieni, dysproporcje pomi\u0119dzy Polsk\u0105 wschodni\u0105 i zachodni\u0105 b\u0119d\u0105 coraz szybciej ros\u0142y. Na razie to si\u0119 nie zmienia, co wida\u0107 po lokowaniu inwestycji: na \u015al\u0105sku G\u00f3rnym, Dolnym, na Pomorzu, czasem na Mazowszu blisko Warszawy \u2013 nie na wschodzie.\n\n**Polska metropolitalna**\nPoza tym zjawisko deglomeracji w takim pa\u0144stwie jak Polska jest bardzo istotne. Nie ma tutaj jednego silnego o\u015brodka miejskiego. Np. w Grecji \u2013 w Atenach \u2013 mieszka 40-45% spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa greckiego. Na 10,5 mln Grek\u00f3w 4 mln mieszka w Atenach. W Polsce jest du\u017co o\u015brodk\u00f3w miejskich. Jest bardzo du\u017co \u015brednich i ma\u0142ych miast. W wojew\u00f3dztwie lubelskim, licz\u0105cym 2 mln mieszka\u0144c\u00f3w, po\u0142owa z nich mieszka w miastach \u2013 mniejszych lub w wi\u0119kszych. Mimo \u017ce to region rolniczy. Je\u015bli wszystkie centralne instytucje s\u0105 wy\u0142\u0105cznie w Warszawie, a bardzo rzadko gdzie indziej, nie sprzyja to tendecji rozwijania region\u00f3w, bo ich waga nie jest taka sama. Nie widz\u0119 uzasadnienia czemu nie wyprowadzi\u0107 z Warszawy cz\u0119\u015bci instytucji centralnych po innych miastach w Polsce. Kolejna przeszkoda w rozwoju takich region\u00f3w jak Lublszczyzna to brak mo\u017cliwo\u015bci stworzenia metropolii, kt\u00f3re regionalnie dawa\u0142yby impuls. W metropolii zawsze zostaj\u0105 dodatkowe pieni\u0105dze, bo ma ona troch\u0119 inne zadnia ni\u017c samorz\u0105d terytorialny. To pozwala np.: rozwin\u0105\u0107 transport czy szkolnictwo na wy\u017cszym poziomie dla ludno\u015bci zamieszkuj\u0105cej pod du\u017cymi miastami. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce gdyby np.: w Lublinie da\u0142oby si\u0119 zrobi\u0107 tak\u0105 metropoli\u0119, Lublin bardzo by na tym zyska\u0142. I te metropolie powinny mie\u0107 okre\u015blone cechy. Pos\u0142u\u017c\u0119 si\u0119 tylko jednym przyk\u0142adem: je\u015bli kto\u015b w Polsce zdecydowa\u0142, \u017ce ma by\u0107 4-5 wiod\u0105cych uczelni, bo na wi\u0119cej nas nie sta\u0107, to pozosta\u0142e regiony w swoich metropoliach powinny mie\u0107 uczelnie, kt\u00f3re b\u0119d\u0105 regionalnymi centrami edukacji na poziomie wy\u017cszym. Moim zdaniem nic nie stoi na przeszkodzie, \u017ceby taki o\u015brodek uczelniany mia\u0142 miejscowe filie. Tak jak pa\u0144stwowe wy\u017csze szko\u0142y zawodowe w Che\u0142mie czy w Bia\u0142ej Podlaskiej, kt\u00f3re niczego nie wnosz\u0105 do niczego moim zdaniem. Gdyby po\u0142\u0105czy\u0107 te potencja\u0142y, to co\u015b by z tego by\u0142o. Teraz status lokalnych uczelni z czasem si\u0119 degraduje. Jak ko\u0144czy\u0142em klas\u0119 maturaln\u0105 w Lublinie, naturalne dla nas wszystkich by\u0142o, \u017ce na prawo idziemy na UMCS ( *przyp.: Uniwersytet Marii Curie - Sk\u0142odowskiej* ), a na medycyn\u0119 na Akademi\u0119 Medyczn\u0105 w Lublinie. Dla nikogo nie by\u0142o sensu jecha\u0107 do innego miasta, bo poziomy uczelni by\u0142y por\u00f3wnywalne. Natomiast rozmawia\u0142em na zje\u017adzie absolwent\u00f3w z m\u0142odszymi rocznikami w moim liceum i dla nich UMCS nawet nie by\u0142 trzecim wyborem. Co oznacza, \u017ce poziom uczelni podupad\u0142 strasznie. R\u00f3\u017cnica jesat tylko taka, \u017ce my absolutnie nie mieli\u015bmy wyboru wyjecha\u0107 na studia za granic\u0119. A dzisiaj idzieszz i studiujesz gdzie chcesz.\n\n**Dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 polityczna**\nJestem cz\u0142onkiem Nowoczesnej i to by\u0142 m\u00f3j pierwszy zwi\u0105zek z parti\u0105 polityczn\u0105. By\u0142em jej cz\u0142onkiem od 2015 r., czyli na lubelszczy\u017anie od pocz\u0105tku. Pomaga\u0142em w wyborach parlamentarnych. Wtedy te\u017c by\u0142em na li\u015bcie jako kandydat. W ka\u017cdym razie to by\u0142o moje jedyne kandydowanie jak na razie. Programowo to by\u0142o wtedy najbli\u017csze mi ugrupowanie polityczne. By\u0142o - jak to si\u0119 dzisiaj m\u00f3wi \u2013 progresywne. Chcia\u0142o postawi\u0107 na reform\u0119 polityk publicznych. To chyba jedyne has\u0142o, kt\u00f3re przebi\u0142o si\u0119 spo\u0142ecznie, \u017ce mo\u017cna urz\u0105dzi\u0107 Polsk\u0119 inaczej za te same pieni\u0105dze. Rzeczywi\u015bcie w Polsce jest ogromna skala marnotrawstwa publicznych pieni\u0119dzy. Niewyobra\u017calna wr\u0119cz. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce w ka\u017cdej dziedzinie, ale tak si\u0119 m\u00f3wi o niedofinnasowaniu s\u0142u\u017cby zdrowia. Na pewno te\u017c dlatego, \u017ce przeznaczamy na ni\u0105 za ma\u0142y procent PKB, ale innym powodem niedofinansowania jest to, \u017ce pieni\u0105dze s\u0105 marnowane na nieistotne rzeczy, r\u00f3\u017cnego typu idiotyzmy. Wizj\u0105 Nowoczesnej by\u0142a Polska dobrze zarz\u0105dzana. Gdzie us\u0142ugi publiczne s\u0105 w odpowiednim stosunku jako\u015bci do przeznaczonych na to \u015brodk\u00f3w publicznych. Pierwsz\u0105 rzecz\u0105 jak\u0105 \u017ce\u015bmy zrobili w ramach Nowoczesnej by\u0142o napisanie programu zreformowania s\u0142u\u017cby zdrowia. To do\u015b\u0107 skomplikowany system, ale najpro\u015bciej m\u00f3wi\u0105c, chcieli\u015bmy po\u0142o\u017cy\u0107 du\u017cy nacisk na profilaktyk\u0119, czego dzi\u015b nie ma w og\u00f3le. To pozwoli\u0142oby zaoszcz\u0119dzi\u0107 bardzo du\u017co pieni\u0119dzy, bo skuteczna profilaktyka, to mniej chor\u00f3b, a mniej chor\u00f3b, to mniej wydatk\u00f3w na leczenie. Profilaktyk\u0119 nale\u017cy szeroko rozumie\u0107. Zar\u00f3wno jako profilaktyk\u0119 zdrowotn\u0105, jak i edukacyjn\u0105, czyli zupe\u0142nie inaczej wygl\u0105daj\u0105 lekcje aktywno\u015bci fizycznej dla dzieci. Ma\u0142o dzieci korzysta z jakichkolwiek form aktywno\u015bci fizycznej, co przejawia si\u0119 oty\u0142o\u015bci\u0105, oty\u0142o\u015b\u0107 trzeba leczy\u0107, a to przek\u0142ada si\u0119 na pieni\u0105dze. Wi\u0105\u017ce si\u0119 dodatkowo z chorobami kr\u0105\u017cenia, cukrzyc\u0105, a to wszystko jest drogie. Druga rzecz to utworzenie konkurencji pomi\u0119dzy organizatorami systemu. Dzisiaj jest jeden NFZ ( *przyp.: Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia* ), nie ma \u017cadnej konkurencji i robi co chce. Nikt tak naprawd\u0119 nie sprawdza NFZ: czy procedury, kt\u00f3re on wymy\u015bla i szacuje \u2013 czy one s\u0105 dobrze czy \u017ale oszacowane. To pozostaje poza jak\u0105kolwiek kontrol\u0105, czego najlepszym przyk\u0142adem w Polsce jest kardiologia lub opieka nad seniorami. Kardiologia w tym sensie, \u017ce operuje si\u0119 przypadki nieoperacyjne tylko po to, \u017ceby zgarn\u0105\u0107 kas\u0119 z NFZ. Ludzi, kt\u00f3rzy nie wymagaj\u0105 leczenia operacyjnego, operuje si\u0119 na si\u0142\u0119 ze wzgl\u0119du na kas\u0119. A z drugiej strony we\u017amy geriatri\u0119, kt\u00f3ra zawsze by\u0142a do tego stopnia niedofinansowana, \u017ce mimo \u017ce spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo si\u0119 starzeje, nie ma nad nimi \u017cadnej opieki: ani specjalist\u00f3w ani o\u015brodk\u00f3w do tego przygotowanych. Chcieli\u015bmy wprowadzi\u0107 konkurencyjno\u015b\u0107, \u017ceby tego rodzaju patologie wyeliminowa\u0107. \u017beby by\u0142o tak, \u017ce ludzie si\u0119 lecz\u0105 tam i p\u0142ac\u0105 sk\u0142adki tam, gdzie oferuje im si\u0119 najlepsze us\u0142ugi. W ostatnim raporcie Fundacji im. St. Batorego te\u017c jest jaki\u015b pomys\u0142 alternatywny. Oni z kolei proponuj\u0105, \u017ceby zamiast NFZ organizatorami systemu byli marsza\u0142kowie wojew\u00f3dztwa, zarz\u0105dy i sejmiki wojew\u00f3dztwa. Pomys\u0142\u00f3w jest na to bardzo du\u017co. Oczywi\u015bcie jest te\u017c kwestia zmniejszenia hospitalizacji, kt\u00f3ra jest bardzo droga. W Polsce jest za du\u017co os\u00f3b hospitalizowanych, zw\u0142aszcza w powiatowych szpitalach na tzw. internach. Z braku specjalistycznej pomocy, np.: seniorom, le\u017c\u0105 tam osoby w starszym wieku, kt\u00f3re w og\u00f3le nie powinny by\u0107 hospitalizowane. Po prostu le\u017c\u0105. Rodziny nie chc\u0105 si\u0119 nimi zajmowa\u0107, szpitale zape\u0142niaj\u0105 l\u00f3\u017cka, dzi\u0119ki czemu maj\u0105 pieni\u0105dze z NFZ.\n\nKolejna kwestia to wykszta\u0142cenie kadr medycznych, kt\u00f3rych w Polsce jest o wiele za ma\u0142o, je\u015bli chodzi o potrzeby. Troch\u0119 ostatnio przez podwy\u017cki piel\u0119gniarek poprawi\u0142o si\u0119 w tej grupie zawodowej. Ale ta sytuacja nie dotyczy ani fizjoterapeut\u00f3w ani ratownik\u00f3w medycznych, jednostek laboratoryjnych. Jednym ze sposob\u00f3w zmiany sytuacji brak\u00f3w kadrowych jest uwolnienie kierunk\u00f3w medycznych dla prywatnych uczelni. Jest takie prze\u015bwiadczenie, \u017ce prywatnie si\u0119 nie da i ma\u0142o tych uczelni prowadzi takie studia lekarskie, nie wiadomo dlaczego. Nie wiem na ile ludzie zdaj\u0105 sobie spraw\u0119, \u017ce uczelnie medyczne s\u0105 jedynymi w Polsce, gdzie to rektorzy decyduj\u0105 o tym ile os\u00f3b przyj\u0105\u0107 na studia. Nie rynek o tym decyduje, nie organizator systemu, kt\u00f3ry ma dane, gdzie jakich lekarzy brakuje, tylko rektorzy. Wiadomo, \u017ce to s\u0105 \u015brodowiska lekarskie i wiadomo, \u017ce zawsze b\u0119d\u0105 prowadzi\u0107 tak\u0105 dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107, bo trudno, \u017ceby prowadzili inn\u0105, \u017ceby nie robi\u0107 sobie konkurencji. Np.: wydzia\u0142, kt\u00f3ry ma mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 przyj\u0119cia 200 student\u00f3w, przyjmuje 100. To jest wi\u0119kszy komfort pracy i mniejsza konkurencja w przysz\u0142o\u015bci.\n\nTak\u017ce w Nowoczesnej najwa\u017cniejszy by\u0142 dla mnie program. Na pocz\u0105tku te\u017c by\u0142o bardzo du\u017co energii. Kiedy przychodzi\u0142o si\u0119 na spotkania organizacyjne, to byli ludzie, k\u00f3rym si\u0119 chcia\u0142o, kt\u00f3rzy mieli pomys\u0142y, kt\u00f3rzy chcieli si\u0119 anga\u017cowa\u0107. To bardzo szybko si\u0119 zmieni\u0142o. W\u0142a\u015bciwie p\u00f3\u0142 energii wyczerpa\u0142o si\u0119 teraz po wyborach jak pewna grupa dzia\u0142aczy czy cz\u0142onk\u00f3w zosta\u0142a pos\u0142ami. Zamiast zajmowa\u0107 si\u0119 dzia\u0142alno\u015bci\u0105 programow\u0105, dali si\u0119 wci\u0105gn\u0105\u0107 w jak\u0105\u015b bie\u017c\u0105c\u0105 pysk\u00f3wk\u0119 polityczn\u0105. W zwi\u0105zku z czym po\u0142owie dzia\u0142aczy po prostu opad\u0142y r\u0119ce, bo nie do takiej Nowoczesnej si\u0119 zapisywali. Nie chodzi\u0142o im o przekrzykiwanie si\u0119 na m\u00f3wnicy i w programie telewizyjnym, tylko o dyskutowanie nad konkretnymi rozwi\u0105zaniami i projektami, czym\u015b po\u017cytecznym publicznie. Tego zabrak\u0142o. My\u015bmy co prawda uruchomili par\u0119 fajnych program\u00f3w. Tutaj w Lublinie przez rok dzia\u0142a\u0142a do\u015b\u0107 liczna grupa programowa, kt\u00f3ra swoje do\u015bwiadczenia zawodowe i \u017cyciowe z r\u00f3\u017cnych dziedzin \u017cycia spo\u0142ecznego wnosi\u0142a do tych program\u00f3w reform. O r\u00f3\u017cnych rzeczach \u017ce\u015bmy rozmawiali: o programie energetycznym, o zdrowiu, o szkolnictwie, o nauce, o porz\u0105dku publicznym, o wojsku... O wszystkim. Tych ludzi, co chcieli si\u0119 anga\u017cowa\u0107 i po\u015bwi\u0119cali sw\u00f3j czas, \u017ceby dyskutowa\u0107 w jakich\u015b grupach, by\u0142o naprawd\u0119 du\u017co. Tylko to te\u017c si\u0119 wyczerpa\u0142o, dlatego, \u017ce nie by\u0142o \u017cadnego odzewu z centrali. Nawet jak przygotowywali\u015bmy pierwsz\u0105 konwencj\u0119 programow\u0105 Nowoczesnej, kt\u00f3ra by\u0142a tak jako\u015b w 2016 r., brali od nas r\u00f3\u017cne pomys\u0142y, kilkadziesi\u0105t stron opracowania \u017ce\u015bmy wys\u0142ali do Warszawy, po czym tak naprawd\u0119 o programie na koniec decydowa\u0142a grupka 4-5 os\u00f3b, bez dyskusji. A nie wszystko w tym przyj\u0119tym programie dzia\u0142aczom lokalnym si\u0119 podoba\u0142o. Kim byli ci dzia\u0142acze lokalni? Albo przedsi\u0119biorcy albo pracownicy uczelni. Nowoczesna nie by\u0142o konkurencj\u0105 dla \u017cadnej opcji politycznej, dlatego \u017ce to by\u0142o jedyne ugrupowanie., kt\u00f3re mia\u0142o program bardzo pragmatyczny, nie populistyczny. My\u015bmy nie ukrywali, \u017ce zrealizowanie takiego programu potrwa kilka-kilkana\u015bcioe lat. \u017be to b\u0119dzie si\u0119 wi\u0105za\u0142o z do\u015bwiadczeniami spo\u0142ecznymi i niekt\u00f3re z nich wyjd\u0105, a inne by\u0107 mo\u017ce nie. Na pocz\u0105tku by\u0142a taka wola, \u017ceby to zrobi\u0107 i przeprowadzi\u0107, a je\u015bli jest si\u0119 w opozycji \u2013 pokaza\u0107 \u017ce mo\u017cna. Tylko to si\u0119 bardzo szybko wypali\u0142o. Lokalnie wypali\u0142o si\u0119 dlatego, \u017ce nie by\u0142o \u017cadnego odzewu z centrali. Nie by\u0142o z nimi kontaktu. Zacz\u0119li nadawa\u0107 zupe\u0142nie na innych falach. Takich spotka\u0144 jak to s\u0142ynne pierwsze na Torwarze, drugie takie du\u017ce w Gda\u0144sku, gdzie przyje\u017cd\u017ca\u0142y rzeczywi\u015bcie tysi\u0105ce ludzi, atmosfera by\u0142a reformatorska, szybko si\u0119 sko\u0144czy\u0142y. W\u0142a\u015bciwie kres Nowoczesnej to by\u0142a ta sytuacja, po kt\u00f3rej nasi pos\u0142owie nie potrafili zag\u0142osowa\u0107 nad projektem ustawy o zmianie ustawy o IPN *(dalej: Instytut Pami\u0119ci Narodowej* ), gdzie jedna osoba zag\u0142osowa\u0142a \u015bwiadomie z 29- osobowego klubu, a chwil\u0119 p\u00f3\u017aniej w g\u0142osowaniu formalnym pos\u0142om i pos\u0142ankom si\u0119 pomiesza\u0142o nad czym g\u0142osuj\u0105 i przepad\u0142 projekt \u201eproaborcyjny\u201d. To by\u0142 ostatni gw\u00f3\u017ad\u017a do trumny. Potem ju\u017c nikt nie chcia\u0142 z do\u0142u tutaj z nimi rozmawia\u0107, bo nie by\u0142o z kim. Odszed\u0142em z Nowoczesnej na wiosn\u0119 tego roku. Po szeregu sytuacji, ale ostania by\u0142a taka, \u017ce Nowoczesna wesz\u0142a w Koalicj\u0119 Europejsk\u0105 z tymi innymi ugrupowaniami i system doboru kandydat\u00f3w na listy z ramienia Nowoczesnej okaza\u0142 si\u0119 drastycznie niedemokratyczny. To by\u0142o co\u015b czego nie by\u0142em w stanie prze\u0142kn\u0105\u0107, bo jednak zapisywa\u0142em si\u0119 do ugrupowania, kt\u00f3re mieni\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce r\u00f3\u017cni si\u0119 od innych partii tym, \u017ce b\u0119dzie demokratyczne i transparentne. Nic z tego.\n\n**W polityce lokalnej**\nNie ma dzisiaj partii, kt\u00f3ra odpowiada\u0142aby moim pogl\u0105dom, bo nie ma partii centrowej w Polsce. W\u0142a\u015bciwie s\u0105 ugrupowania \u015bci\u015ble skrajne: albo mocno lewicowe albo mocno prawicowe. Nie ma \u017cadnego rozs\u0105dnego. W wyborach samorz\u0105dowych g\u0142osowa\u0142em na kandydata na prezydenta na Magd\u0119 D\u0142ugosz, a na list\u0119: Ruch Miejski. PIS nigdy nie popr\u0119 z tego wzgl\u0119du, \u017ce nawet gdybym mia\u0142 koserwatywne pogl\u0105dy, nie popar\u0142bym ich, bo PIS \u0142amie Konstytucj\u0119. Jest to partia niedemokratyczna w swoich poczynaniach. Nie da si\u0119 tego pogodzi\u0107 z moim poczuciem obywatelsko\u015bci. Na Paltform\u0119 Obywatelsk\u0105 nie g\u0142osuj\u0119 i chyba nigdy nie g\u0142osowa\u0142em na Platform\u0119, bo to w istocie partia konserwatywna, kt\u00f3ra przedstawia si\u0119 w innej sk\u00f3rze. Chcocia\u017c te\u017c trzeba wzi\u0105\u0107 pod uwag\u0119 gdzie mieszkamy. Zdarzaj\u0105 si\u0119 osoby liberalne. Gdybym mieszka\u0142 w innej cz\u0119\u015bci kraju, by\u0107 mo\u017ce zag\u0142osowa\u0142bym na Platform\u0119. A u nas niestety, sorry, ale nie ma na kogo. Lista Platformy w ostatnich wyborach parlamentarnych to by\u0142a jedna wielka pora\u017cka. Nie by\u0142o nikogo, na kogo mo\u017cna zag\u0142osowa\u0107 odpowiedzialnie. W wyborach samorz\u0105dowych konkurencj\u0105 dla PIS by\u0142 klub \u017buka. Akurat o \u017buku podoba mi si\u0119 to, co powiedzia\u0142 kiedy\u015b Jacek Bury, jeszcze jak byli\u015bmy kolegami z partii: \u017buk jest najlepszym prezydentem jakiego dotychczas Lublin mia\u0142, ale jakby tak u\u017cy\u0107 metafory motoryzacyjnej, Lublin mia\u0142 przed \u017bukiem same syrenki i wartburgi, a \u017buk jest takim, powiedzmy, golfem, ale spokojnie mo\u017cemy mie\u0107 BMW czy mercedesa. \u017buk jest dobrze postrzegany w por\u00f3wnaniu z poprzednikami, bo to byli nieudacznicy, natomiast mieszka\u0144cy Lublina zas\u0142uguj\u0105 na ko\u015b lepszego ni\u017c on i takie osoby s\u0105. To tylko kwestia wypromowania kogo\u015b takiego, co wymaga du\u017co pracy w spo\u0142ecznej dzia\u0142alno\u015bci. Nie ma ludzi, kt\u00f3rzy chcieliby si\u0119 zaanga\u017cowa\u0107, wi\u0119c prawdopodobnie kolejna kadencja te\u017c b\u0119dzie nale\u017ca\u0142a do \u017buka. Chyba \u017ce nie b\u0119dzie chcia\u0142. We wschodnich pa\u0144stwach tak jest, \u017ce ust\u0119puj\u0105cy w\u0142adca wskazuje nast\u0119pc\u0119 i w Lublinie pewnie b\u0119dzie tak samo, je\u017celi nie wypromuje si\u0119 nikogo innego. Poza tym jacy\u015b nacjonali\u015bci, prawie faszy\u015bci startowali w wyborach. I ten Ruch Miejski by\u0142 jedyn\u0105 organizacj\u0105 \u2013 zlepkiem ludzi o r\u00f3\u017cnych pogl\u0105dach: byli i koserwaty\u015bci, i lewicowcy, i centy\u015bci, i pracownicy uczelni, i bezrobotni, i przedsi\u0119biorcy... Magda D\u0142ugosz jest z Partii Razem, wi\u0119c jest komunistk\u0105 z przekonania. Zupe\u0142nie mi te pogl\u0105dy nie odpowiadaj\u0105. Natomiast w\u015br\u00f3d kandydat\u00f3w na prezydenta by\u0142a najlepsza. Tak samo jak oddawa\u0142em g\u0142os na kandydata na radnego. Oczywi\u015bcie najpierw zrobi\u0142em tak, \u017ce wys\u0142a\u0142em maile do kandydat\u00f3w ze swojego okr\u0119gu z r\u00f3\u017cnymi pytaniami. \u017badna osoba mi nie odpowiedzia\u0142a. Jedna pani po miesi\u0105cu przys\u0142a\u0142a mi odpowied\u017a na zasadzie, \u017cebym spada\u0142, tylko w bardziej urz\u0119dowych s\u0142owach.

What are you working on and why are you on the Internet Days?**\n\nMy name is Ingela Wettergrund and I work as a webmaster at the Neuro Association. Come here to see what's going on. Have a look.\n\nRegarding the Neuro Association and the Internet - it overlaps greatly. We use it as a communication channel in many ways, while also having a target group that is not always so digital.\n\nWhat are the challenges for the target group with the digital? Partly, without prejudice, it is a fairly high average age. Then there are many people who have neurological diagnoses that  may have problems with fine motor skills and may have cognitive problems, which can be an obstacle.\n\n**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**\n\nWhat emerges is ... in my job, where it has been part of educating our association members on how to publish on the web. It can often be an uphill job. I had a session with a web editor digitally, where she saw my screen. Then I received an email afterwards: \u201cThat was great! I get it! It's fun to work like this! \u201d. Then I feel that I have succeeded.\n\nI feel hopeful about AI and such things. In a non-profit organization, there is more will than resources. Then you realize that it can help us to work.\n\nFor example, I am the editor of our newsletter. There you could use it. We have three newsletters that are sent very widely. With AI you can see, maybe ... you can see who is interested in what and give them more of what they want.\n\n**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**\n\nWell, the security problem. Being hacked and passwords that do not hold and such. This is especially true in such an organization that I work in, where the data we handle is sensitive data. Even though you might not directly say that you have a neurological diagnosis, but you can draw the conclusion from the data you have. Maybe not something people want to be open with. Sometimes it is obvious that you have a diagnosis, sometimes not. You may want to keep it to yourself and that you have to have respect for.\n\nThose I work with are definitely affected. Many have contacts  with the health care system. Contacting via 1177 and bank ID can be difficult for many. People who have Parkinson's may have difficulty managing digital services. Can be difficult if you get older.", "created_at": "2019-11-26 14:58:59.425956", "updated_at": "2019-11-26 14:58:59.425956", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 442, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 482, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 449, "post_number": 1, "raw": "This is a group for the Lote3 and unMonastery\u00a0Hosts Commitee.\n\nOur Role(s) :\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe host committee\u00a0has been enjoying inspiring conversations all summer, and we would like to propose the contributions to make Lote3 even more welcoming space.\n\n<strong>Work Titles</strong>\n\n[bembo-davies]\u00a0- the Precious Fountain of the Ancient Tradition have offered to help everyone find the great name for their jobs titles.\n\nour work titles are :\n\n<a class=\"mentions mentions-1531\" href=\"/u/dorotea\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 19px; font-style: italic; line-height: 19px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" title=\"Dorotea\">Dorotea</a><em> - Atmosphere Choreographer, </em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em><a class=\"mentions mentions-1029\" href=\"/u/havartu\" style=\"color: rgb(233, 92, 46); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 19px; font-style: italic; line-height: 19px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" title=\"havartu\">havartu</a><em> \u2013 Ambassador of Counterbalance</em>\n\n<em>you - ... ?</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Mini-Workshops</strong>\n\nWe also propose for everyone to bring a mini-workshop to share one-on-one, and this can be shared at any time, also at the proposed unDojo space .\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>The unDojo Space</strong>\n\nWe also propose a space in which everyone can have a peaceful moment, as Lote might be an intense experience, to reflect and connect with one-self and each-other .\u00a0\n\nTo have a tea and to meditate or just enjoy a peaceful moment,\u00a0reflect on meaningful questions and co-design answers.\n\nWe plan to host there the big tracks such as\n\nhow to make meaningful projects happen - the cookbook ,\n\nand how do we care better for each other .\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>The unParty</strong>\n\nWe also plan to contribute to make the great\u00a0unParty\u00a0\n\n(we prefer this name rather than\u00a0unHalloween\u00a0)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>co-creating good vibes and good atmosphere</strong>\u00a0\n\nthe role of hosts, especially the atmosphere choreographer, is also to help to make everyone feel good at lote3, co-creating good vibes and good atmosphere, and facilitate the environment for serendipity and synergies.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-02 20:20:05", "updated_at": "2017-08-06 11:35:52.926551", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 432, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 1467, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64329, "user_id": 3206, "topic_id": 11533, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Of course it's good, I don't see how fossil fuel industry can need any subsidies :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2019-11-16 09:19:58.395825", "updated_at": "2019-11-16 09:19:58.395825", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 7.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 619, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 586, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2014-08-03 17:03:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:01.792892", "deleted_at": "2017-08-03 14:49:08.602504", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3, 145, 3643], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65919, "user_id": 3206, "topic_id": 11945, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![Jasen%20uvod|518x690,50%](upload://ufKtpZ3GQBguy0NPqQAz4Vjf5Lj.jpeg) \n\nJa sam po\u010deo iako je bio plan da Noemi pri\u010da o Edgeryders organizaciji.\nPoku\u0161ao sam da vam do\u010daram ko su Edgeryders, koje su na\u0161e vrednosti i \u0161ta konkretno nudimo zajednici u Be\u010deju.\nU par re\u010denica:\nCilj nam je da \u010dujemo va\u0161e pri\u010de, kroz njih saznamo \u0161ta su vam interesovanja, ciljevi i koje prepreke vam stoje na putu do ispunjenja tih ciljeva.

It describes our journey through life as moving towards a core by peeling off layers. In practice this has re-oriented my approach to \"trying and failing\" - in that I rarely fail ... all of my attempts are valuable in this of \"not this, not that\" ... every failure\u00a0 is another layer peeled off ... another step closer. To me this seems to take the edge off the \"edge\".\n\nRemoving importance and urgency. Passion can be a wonderful fuel but can also be explosive. \"Nothing we do is important, yet its important that we do it\"... I am starting to get the hang of this ... importance unnecessarily sharpens the \"edge\".\n\nWhat if we experience \"the edge\" because somewhere deep inside we are still measuring ourselves by the mainstream (that which is further from the edge)? I am on the \"edge\" at least partly because I couldn't bare living in the mainstream. Now people from the mainstream view me as \"on the edge\" when I actually feel soft and safe and that THEY are living on the edge. Do we enjoy thinking of ourselves as living on the edge? maybe it's not something we need to learn to live with but something we need to learn to let go off?\n\nCan we do something to prevent the edge from \"burning\"? Maybe preventing fires is better than trying to put them out?\n\nThe most challenging aspect of my personal experience of \"the edge\" has been loneliness. I have been gifted with tools to being in balance or recovering balance ... but these tools cannot change the fact that I am alone ... the \"edge\" isn't a densly populated area :)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-28 19:45:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:51.830436", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 472, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41220, "user_id": 4286, "topic_id": 7983, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2f53f228306ce5d491a1ce255416146791225d29.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3849ced281c79a33d0b4133b5917ee9ef79bbba4.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/465a4289dd55bb7bdfc45e815e87a76eed8e9a47.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3cbf7d7e9d6bf9ec3f798229ba941324b5d67386.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/46cbc9f8b7aefd9f3f3f5ad0d922896ccd973dec.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"515\">\n\n[(see also this article)](http://alkahera.co/2017/03/30/%D8%A3%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%B4%D9%88%D9%82%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%AA%D9%8F%D8%A8-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%82%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%82%D9%88%D8%B5-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%82/)\n\nI'm Amin Osama from a rural town in Upper Egypt which is 10 hours away from Cairo, the capital of Egypt. . I graduated from Faculty of Arts, Mass Communication department, South Valley University. I was interested in Cinema since I was a child; watching endless number of movies and reading about cinematic concepts. However, there was no cinema theaters at all. Moreover, Qus local community is a conservative one where the idea of a little lady going to cinema, if any, was not accepted.\n\nThat is why I was thinking of a cinema club; to have an open and free cinema space for everybody. I used my cinematic knowledge and as a volunteer at \"Qus Baladna\" youth group, I started one year ago the cinema club as a coordinator for it.\n\n\u201cQus Baladna\u201d was established as a youth group in Qus, Qena, Egypt in 2010. Since its very beginnings, the group was concerned with contributing to the local community through cultural, social and charitable activities.\n\nAs part of the cultural variety Qus Baladna is concerned with all along, the Cinema Club was established one year ago. \n\n**Objectives:**\n\n1. Promote interest in cinema among young generations in Qus. \n2. Encourage the youth to identify different cinematic cultures rather than the traditional Hollywood/Egyptian movies. \n3. Help young generations understand very basic cinematic concepts in addition to the cinematic background of each movie.\n\n**Methodology:** The Cinema Club methodology is based on the following steps per each event:\n\n1. Screening of a movie followed by a feedback from the club coordinator in relation to cinematic aspects and short historical background the movie\n2. Open discussion with the audience in relation to the movie\n\nEvents are organized on a weekly basis mainly in Qus city. Few events were organized in some villages as an approach of horizontal scope dissemination of cinema culture\n\nMovies are either selected by the audience or the club coordinator. Selection of movies is not limited to Hollywood production. It is extended to Iranian, French, Emirati and other movies in addition to animation movies sometimes. \n\n**Partnerships and Cooperation:**\n\n1. Partnership with Zawya Cinema in the European Film Festival: screening French animation movie \u201cAdama\u201d \u2013 November 2017 \n2. Hosting the Cairo-based cinema critic Ahmad Shawky to provide feedback and discussion with audience after screening the Iranian movie \u201cAbout Elly\u201d \u2013 March 2017\n3. Cooperation with Qus Cultural Palace and Qus Charity Association for screening of movies.", "created_at": "2018-01-15 20:33:39.688654", "updated_at": "2018-01-16 10:33:07.669674", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 541, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 2383.0, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1935, 5, 4, 3703, 3782, 2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82653, "user_id": 6339, "topic_id": 13988, "post_number": 123, "raw": "Hello @Wojt, I can confirm, that most of my codes that were 100% with Czech translation are now missing it.

We actively encourage any and all users to share or tell their story.  And we each, mostly, have done that - written some paragraphs about our lives and experiences.  But I think we all agree that we do not, and have not, got the kind of response we hope for.  \n\nIn pondering this problem, my mind often travels to the various places where I contribute online.  I admit I am a pretty regular Facebook user.  I despise them as a company and their leadership, spying, bad interface - all of it.  But I still use it because it fulfills a function.  Connects me to a wider variety of friends and relations than other platforms, and makes it easy to post media other than words, which is important for me who loves photos and audio especially.  And of course there is Twitter, which I also use sometimes, though I find it perhaps the most ADD-inducing entity in history.  But when I think of the social media platforms, I often think about how I had envisioned that Edgeryders, with all of the super interesting, compelling people who pass through, would become a place that would engage more of the kind of casual ongoing storytelling that is the bread and butter of social media.  \n\nEdgeryders.eu isn't that, and clearly it, or this group of leaders of it, do not want to use it for that.  I think that is too bad, and have said so before, but I accept it and use other platforms for such things.  But - I think I see a relationship between this and the difficulty we have in getting more people here to 'tell their stories' and getting people to hang with us for extended ongoing periods of time. Of course some do and we build relationships with them, sometimes to great mutual benefit, but that isn't even close to a majority, and frankly, fall short of the numbers we promised to our funders (though we can still get there).\n\nEdgeryders is rich in material, ideas, links, people doing, or trying to do great things.  The people ER attracts are almost always impressive in more than any one way.  But, other than a more formal 'story,' usually by someone highly motivated to tell it, often to suit a business or project purpose they want to promote or energize in some way, we don't have much of any casual talk.  And the orientation is so word-based that we now see a lot of people come in and think it is hard to use.  That amazed me, until I realized my frame of reference is interfaces vastly harder and most others' is social media.  This is why Natalia brought up the idea of a voice-based way to make comments.  \n\nBut I see it less as a platform problem and more of a leadership problem in the sense that we ourselves stick so closely to project-talk only that it looks, and in fact pretty much is, a kind of business site.  Who tell stories on a business site?  My point here is that we ourselves do not, nor do we collectively care to, use our own platform as a place to talk about all sorts of things, which in my experience creates the encouraging environment, the soil if you will, from which a 'garden' can flourish.  You may recall that in my talks about community building, platforms should blend the personal and the professional when possible to strengthen the bonds of relationships.  But in truth, we in ER really don't do much of that. And again, I have come to accept it (and not be too bothered when my occasional attempts to make conversation about a wider range of subjects fell flat).  \n\nForgive me if this is too wordy, I think our historical lack of opening up about more things in life, well intentioned as it is, hinder our efforts to get more people who arrive to open up about themselves.  The 'tell your story' or share or whatever, looks more like a mini-essay in this environment than a low-barrier, casual if you want, entrance into conversing.  \n\nWe do, correctly, put a lot of energy into in-person encounters, from tiny meetups to festivals, as a crucial component of community building. And that works well. But with us, most of the personal bonding takes place in person and not so much online.  Once again, I accept this and generally think it is fine and definitely contributes to the obviously to anyone friendly atmosphere of ER.  But again, at risk of belaboring it, to a newcomer it could look like we are a bunch of friends and colleagues who have a variety of good relationships.  It should look like that because we are.  But how does a newer person, especially one who doesn't have some project or action going, find a comfortable entry point?", "created_at": "2019-09-18 18:08:11.425745", "updated_at": "2019-09-18 18:08:11.425745", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 831, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47243, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9009, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Hello and thanks, @amelia.\n\n* 2 articles coming up.

More than ever, MENA youth suffer from social, economic, and political exclusion.\n\nIt was also brought to their attention the four main components on which the incubation program is articulated that are: the online labs, the offline tasks, the webinar conducted by our experts and finally one to one labs with OCI lab mentors.\n\nAfterwards, Mr Wajdi started displaying the objectives of the second online lab, then he continued to explain the concept of a lean startup and its methodology which is a rigorous process of iterating from plan A to a plan that works. Following the explanation of lean learning, he moved to the next part that treats the sketching of the hypothesis that represents an essential part and therefore there were many examples and templates to illustrate the point.\n\nHe also showed them how to create a hypothetical customer persona which a representation of the ideal customer.\nAt that point, we took a short break to ask the participants for their feedback or their questions. We have received many relevant questions and a positive feedback.\n\nAt the end, he described how to define the value proposition of their solutions and the best practices to establish an effective one, followed by an illustration of the value proposition canvas and its Ad-lib.\n\nAt last, we had a questions and answers session then we invited our mentor Emile to present himself and finally send the offline tasks to the attendees and invite them to continue the discussion via the follow-up lab link on the Edgeryders platform.\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr Wajdi and the relevant interaction from our brilliant project leaders for ensuring such a productive and fruitful lab.", "created_at": "2019-12-23 12:13:44.327929", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 13:37:17.508369", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 504, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 178.8, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3782, 5538, 5860, 5547, 8, 6048, 6132, 6085], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2939, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2906, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Booting up the research team \u2013 methodology and technology.

The chat will be saved temporarily, for the purposes of completing the writeups, but not shared, and deleted as the writeups are published.\n 7. **Will the research be published?** One or more writeups will appear on https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/coworking-recovery/364. Writeups will be attributed to their authors, not the participants. That is an open forum, so participants are welcome to use it to comment, respond, or contribute their own writeups. The whole content of the public-facing forum(including the mentioned writeup, and any discussion about them) will then become the basis for at least one research report. We also hope to publish one or more journal article. If you would like to be a co-author, we are in principle open for it.

I am a junior doctor in the UK, currently 3 years out of med school, with an MSc in Humanitarian Studies. Coming from an academic angle I am very much aware of the limitations and formalised structures of my knowledge and learning so far. \n\nI am taking a couple of years out of formal training to take part in the wider world of health, healthcare and healthcare delivery. I have recently returned from Belgrade, Serbia supporting an unofficial camp of around 800-1200 migrants, majority Afghan, all male, squatting in the city centre. I teamed up with a creative and passionate trauma nurse practitioner from the states, who had a lot of involvement in the squat clinics in Athens, and together we built a small clinic tent (literally gazebo and tarpaulin) and set about delivering health care to the community. One of the earliest challenges we faced was how to deliver healthcare where there was no infrastructure in place, not even a basic clean, safe and private space to consult or examine patients. In this setting the lack of infrastructure allowed us to be more creative and fluid about the way we delivered healthcare. Challenging the limited view that healthcare intervention revolve solely around the quick consolation, examination of patients and distribution of pharmaceuticals. In fact these are the last stages of healthcare and may only be offering a quick fix to a much broader problem. I think it is so important to be a part of the wider community outside of clinic walls. \n\nThe second interesting thing for me was the recognition of environmental factors and how significantly they affected peoples health. We had serious problems with poor sanitation and hygiene and the inevitable infestation of scabies and body lice. Tackling these issues wasn't about treated their medical symptoms (although hopefully we try to achieve that too), it was about recognising the source of the problem and working out ways to overcome or improve the problems. Work such as this prompts you to talk to different voluntary groups and communities about the work they're doing, the infrastructure they're building and their impact on the \"camp\". Bringing a collective ethos to the action and work that everyone was participating in. We also delivered or tried to deliver public health information and education to the community about why they were suffering and how they may be able it help themselves to overcome it (ie. itching and washing). Breaking down the perception that you can solve everything with a pill and encouraging people to recognise the environmental, social and political factors that have an impact on their health. Hoping to encourage peoples independence, knowledge and agency in self care.  \n\nHaving spent the majority of my life so far in school, I haven't had much opportunity to take part in activist or anarchist action. As a beginner, newby or a novice as yet I can't define myself by either of the above. The world at times feels like a dark place, as the planet heats up, the weather fluctuates to greater extremes, there is an increase in natural disasters, war, famine and draught still devastate and kill it is easy to feel overwhelmed. I would love to take part in a community where, despite the heavy dose, cynicism does not prevail. Where in the face of adversity we hope to find some cooperation, creativity,  and compassion.

I did my MSc in statistics, but then I decided to work at the research center of the Bank of Italy, where I was for 18 years of my life. I conducted research on enterprises, on firms and short-term forecasts. When I turned 44, I wanted to make a change and moved to the Treasury. I actually ran in and out of it: I resigned a couple of times, and then I resumed my job. I ran the department for development and was engaged in the south of Italy. After that I worked at the European Union. And then at one point in my life, I became a minister during the governmental crisis 2012, but I resigned from  public administration and moved to working with the civic organization called the Forum for Inequality and Diversity.\n\nI worked on the topic of inequalities and justice for quite a long time. It was quite clear to me that inequality is rising while working as an administrator. When I work with the committee to European Commissioner Danuta Maria H\u00fcbner, when Poland joined. She was an amazing person to work with. \n\nIn 2008, inequality was not a major topic, everyone believed that we should leave everything to the market: inequality would fix itself. We even had a lot of opposition to the Cohesion Policy \u2014 the European Cohesion Policy which addresses the problem of abandoned areas \u2014 but we still pushed forward. The different in the approach was that we didn\u2019t  just give money to people, we tried to empower people. This is what I did as an administrator, but then I felt I wanted to go to the other side of the bench and try to do that with the civic organizations. So, my methodology hasn't changed, but I changed the side of where I'm working.\n\nItaly doesn\u2019t have a very good public administration to be quite frank, a very poor one. And for people like me, who wanted to change the world, it\u2019s been quite difficult. So, in 1968, me and my friends joined the research center of the Bank of Italy because we thought it was a place where we could drive change. It was the place through which you could become a technocrat, with the right soul, and had the possibility to help change the world. I didn't choose economics. In fact, I studied statistics, measuring demography, that's where I started. But then I moved to economics, because I thought that it would be the way to have power and to have more impact. \n\nIn the late 70s, early 80s, we had quite a lot of freedom in our research. I carried on having my own views on labor relations, my own views on small enterprises, my own views on inequality. I was able to conduct my research while having access to an enormous amount of data. But we didn't change the world. At one point in my life, when I was 44-years-old in 1998, I felt it was time for me to role up my sleeves, and I left for the reserves.\n\n\n**Crisis in the Western Hemisphere**\nAll of the Western countries are going through an enormous crisis at the moment. People are angry, they resentment , there\u2019s a so-called authoritarian dynamic. The reason for the authoritarian dynamic are inequalities, social injustice. It\u2019s not only economic inequality, it is access to services, and it is resentment for not being recognized: people in rural areas, the working class, they don\u2019t feel recognized. \n\nThis is a paradox, because we have an information technology that in theory could be improved in equality, and in fact, is producing an enormous unprecedented concentration of knowledge and power in very few hands. \n\nI feel that it's about time that we do something about it before we end up with an authoritarian regime. And the way to do it, is by working together with the working class, with civic organizations. We need to put political pressure on the issues,  and try to influence technology.\n\nThe forum is an alliance of eight organization of civic society and about a hundred researchers, coming together to design proposals. We put together 15 proposal after a year and a half work on social justice. Ten of these focus on the impact of technology, three on labor, and one is bequeathed with the generation transfers.\n\nThe problem is that about 15 years ago, through the time of neoliberalism, the idea was that the state should not interfere with markets. Unfortunately, capitalism can only produce good things, if there is conflict. \n\nIf we put pressure on the entrepreneurs, then they will do somehow what we asked them to do, but if we don't, they don't. Let\u2019s take as an example whether or not a vague algorithm could potentially be put to good use, or to terrible use. At the moment, large companies transfer the predictability and volatility of the market onto the workers, for example, telling them when to work without any regard for their personal lives. But you could use the same algorithm to predict what benefits the worker. It's not the algorithm itself which is the problem, but the objective. \n\nWe believe that by putting pressure on entrepreneurs, by having state owned enterprises with the right goals, or by creating collective platforms where people can actually put together the data on mobility, then use it, and then make sure that everybody has access. We can actually turn these technologies into something which could increase social justice rather than reduce it.\n\n\n**A Digital Age**\nDigitalization of Public Administration is one of the most stupid expressions invented. Digitalization doesn't mean anything in itself. For example, you are running a welfare system at the municipal level and decide to use AI to figure out who should benefit from housing intervention, or from care: then what you are doing is that you are depriving these people from the most important thing \u2014 which is even more important than housing \u2014  namely to interact with human beings, and to be understood by someone who they can express their feelings to. We could have a technology which could be used to actually understand the people in front of you better, but you are using the technology in a wrong matter.\n\nPublic administration at the local level can say they can collect all the information on mobility to redesign the mobility of a particular town. Okay. All right. Fantastic. Only, they don\u2019t share the data with everyone, or with those who are professional, innovative experts who could redesign the mobility. Instead, they allow a single monopoly corporation to become the owner of the data.\n\nSomething like 60% of the Italian territory is hard to reach by car in terms of access to services. These are amazing places, which people like you and me enjoy enjoy for a couple of days. Living there could be beautiful. You could become a farmer. You could live off cultural heritage, and so on. But the people actually living there right now aren\u2019t recognized and they aren\u2019t provided services. \n\nGovernments have been redesigning services in a one-size-fits-all approach, meaning you have the same reform of the health system or education system whether you live in Rome, or Bellino, or Paris. This means, however, that some people may have to travel to school for 45 minutes. And as a result, they grow a sense of resentment. They feel that the only places where we could live (urban areas) are depriving them of their own sense of being somebody. Resentment doesn\u2019t only grow out of having a lower income, but also out of not being recognized. This kind of abandonment produces anger towards the experts that are perceived as working for \u201cthe other guys,\u201d the upper class, the authorities. And the only thing you can do is hate the migrants and call for an authoritarian government which, at least, decides quickly without discussion and participatory \u201cboring things,\u201d what to do. They have lost their trust in democracy. \n\nIn a country like Italy, the concentration of wealth has been remarkable in the last 20 years. There are so many people that don't have much of a choice, they do what they need to do to work, get whatever opportunity that comes along. It\u2019s not a lack of jobs, but it\u2019s the poor quality of those jobs, which have been created through the technological transfer. There is no dignity in the gig economy: at the end of the game, the workers are not in control. \n\nMost people aim in live for substantial freedom. But many people feel deprived from that freedom, which results in resentment.\n\n**From Then Till Now**\nIn my first year my life I studied how the Fiat company in Italy was exploiting their laborers. We analyzed a drop in the fertility rate of women which were being mistreated in the factory. I quite honestly believe that capitalism as a mechanism to extract value from labor. And compared to now and then, this hasn\u2019t changed, only the tools have. \n\nPersonally, what has changed is how I understand change can be driven. I always relied a lot on political parties, I believed in parties, I was a member of them. I also believed a lot in unions. But, I never quite realized how effective civic organizations could be in gathering around specific purposes. Not only doing advocacy work, but also taking things into their own hands, such as shaping services in local areas.\n\n\n**On the event**\nI\u2019m looking forward to discuss these topics with a mix of people with different backgrounds. And I mean not just disciplinary backgrounds, but backgrounds in terms of points of view on the world. I am an institutional person that has spent a big part of his life on that side of the table, but working with a civic organization has shifted my perspective. I hope to come back from the event, understanding  more on the injustices relating techm and perhaps how my own formed opinion wasn\u2019t complete..", "created_at": "2019-11-15 11:23:36.198919", "updated_at": "2020-12-11 14:39:38.330778", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1706, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 102.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63804, "user_id": 5551, "topic_id": 11433, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Will this page turn into the FR equivalent of this one? https://edgeryders.eu/t/join-the-reef-community-workshops-making-of-communal-and-green-living-in-brussels/10897\nBecause if so, then it's definitely too long.

I mean to take for example this part: \n\n[quote=\"CCS, post:1, topic:11118\"]\n### Local Knowledge first\n\nWhat should we do? What is the role of academics and human rights activist in Europe, given these various complications I laid out? I\u2019ve worked with a number of NGOs on security methods and I worked with their safety teams. When I was living in Brazil, I worked with an NGO that specifically focused on digital security trainings for human rights activists. On the one hand, they have limited capacity to engage with all of the latest and greatest technological developments. On the other hand, they have a lot of incredibly local knowledge we tend to not think about naturally, because it doesn&rsquo;t come up in our context.\n\nA great example is a friend who\u2019s a very well-known activist. He knows that the police are monitoring him, that he\u2019s under surveillance, and so are his family and friends. And so one of the things that we did is setting up this elaborate encrypted emailing service for him, explained VPNs, and helped him use signal. And then one morning, he came in, and he said, you know, this is all incredibly great. I now have all of these encrypted services. But you know, what happened this morning. I was sitting on my motorcycle, texting someone, a police officer walked up to me, and just grabbed the phone out of my hand.&rdquo; Which meant that it was open, which meant that no matter the encrypted services, no matter the signal, no matter the VPN, they had access to his phone. We didn\u2019t discuss this scenario because for most of the trainers, it simply hadn\u2019t occurred to them that this might be how the police would act.\n\nI have seen the tendency of European trainers who go abroad with their really elaborate technologies for improving your safety. But they don\u2019t actually address what a security risk looks like on the ground. So, I think one of the things that I would be really interested in, is actually trying to figure out whether a training on IoT is useful, and perhaps look at physical safety. Working with a philosophy where the starting point is: you know a lot about the problems that you have, so explain to us what your problems are, and then collaboratively, we can bring together a bunch of different resources to figure out what a solution should look like. Instead of sharing the technical knowledge that we have, pouring it out and then leaving. Not that everyone does that. But I do think that it is an easy mistake to make, an easy trap to fall into.\n[/quote]\n And post it by itself without real changes so a concentrated discussion of the interesting points made just there can be had and also so we can learn about how this form influences the engagement :)", "created_at": "2019-11-15 11:21:57.738918", "updated_at": "2019-11-15 11:33:18.750270", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 570, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 47.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [61210], "is_reply_to": [61210], "is_liked_by": [1856, 5209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69491, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 12309, "post_number": 22, "raw": "Yes.

Every time I use the code, e.g. \u201cdiversity\u201d, since I was not its original creator, it does not appear in my suggestions.\n[/quote]\n\nHmm ok I guess I finally understand what you mean by \"codes that were automagically merged with codes by other annotators\": when you entered a code that already existed, it was not created another time (this time with you as the creator) but re-used (not changing whoever was the creator before). Nothing is automagically merged, as your own code never existed. You chose to apply somebody else's code by choosing it from the auto-complete list.\n\nThat behavior is intended because the whole application is meant for collaborative coding, so code re-use. The proper solution would be to enter the names of *all* collaborators in your coding team in the backend under \"User Settings \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 Propose codes from users:\". Your team would be the group of people from whom you want to see codes proposed.\n\nThe trouble you're having now is because of the migration from \"your team is everyone contributing to the ethnographic project\" to \"your team is a few users\". To fix this, you'll have to copy codes containing your annotations where the code does not have you as the author. The copy will have you as the author, and you'll have to remove the copies of others' annotations from the copied code and the copies of your own annotations from the original code to prevent redundancy.\n\nOn a more general note, I don't know the purpose of this new feature of proposing codes from selected users. It effectively creates partially overlapping sub-projects inside an ethnographic coding project. Isn't the whole idea of collaborative coding that inside one ethnographic coding project (such as `ethno-poprebel`), one single common codebook is used by everyone?

This wiki contains summaries of 10 depth interviews and conversations currently happening on the edgeryders community forum. It is intended to give a sense of who is \u201cin the room\u201d during our Workshop on Workshop on Inequalities in the age of AI, what they are, how they work and what we can do about them. After the workshop these will be turned into 150-300 word posts that we will be publishing in different formats, and channels to draw visibility and opportunities for collaboration towards everyone who is contributing to this conversation. We are adding new ones on a regular basis, if you wish to be included, talk to us during the workshop tomorrow!  //*\n\n<hr> \n\n### Overview of all 10 Stories: Generic audience \nExperts working at the cutting edge of tech, policy and human rights spaces call for greater consideration to be given to the way that AI is altering the very fabric of society. Both academics and policy makers agree that current AI systems risk amplifying existing human biases that entrench inequality - not least because of the widespread, and misguided, perception that data is inherently neutral. Systems for the reporting of sexual assault, for example, are encoded with developers\u2019 assumptions about sexual violence which do not grasp the complexity of victims\u2019 experiences. Those working and researching in the field caution that AI systems are only as unbiased as the humans who build them, and that continuing to give AI undue weight will cause serious harm to the most vulnerable in society. \n\nAcross medicine, law, entrepreneurship and gender studies, concern is growing that the pressure to innovate for its own sake comes at great risk to privacy, protection and human rights. Experts caution that companies in both the public and private sectors are rushing to implement technology they don\u2019t fully understand, and that it is crucial due care and consideration is taken when building these systems to ensure they are value-driven and accountable. Unchecked digitisation in the fields of medicine, social work and the reporting of sexual assault fails to recognise human needs which are more nuanced, individualised and unpredictable than AI can fathom. It is critical we ensure that AI is designed and used in such a way that it serves society\u2019s needs -- not the other way around.\n\n#### Examples from each story\n* Marco: In predictive medicine, there are so many biological variables that scaling data up can decrease precision\n* Corinne: complex encryption systems built to protect an activist were found to be lacking when a police officer simply stole his phone from his hand.\n* Peter: ....\n* Seda: ....\n* Hugi: ....\n* Kate: ....\n* Justin: ....\n* Oliver: ....\n* Fabrizio: ....\n* Alberto: ....\n\n\n\n#### Social media updates for media-friendly summary articles\n\nSelf-reinforcing loop of data puts human rights at risk\n\nUnchecked digital expansion could be a force for democratisation -- or further entrench inequality\n\nIt is critical that AI serves people -- not the other way around.\n\nDiscourse must move from technology to societal impact\n\nPerception of data as inherently neutral is dangerous to society\n\nPutting human rights at the forefront of digital expansion is critical\n\nOne-size-fits all approach to AI in public services breeds division and intolerance\n\nInteroperability key to sustainable innovation\n\nMeaningful debate on AI must be prioritised above innovation.\n\n<hr>\n\n### The rush to implement AI too widely and simplistically could have disastrous consequences \n#### A conversation with Marco Manca\n\nMarko Mana is an interdisciplinary researcher in mathematics and informational systems with an educational background in medicine. He founded the [SCimPulse Foundation](http://www.scimpulse.org/about-us/), which he still directs, and is also part of several scientific organisations and commissions, including the working group of NATO for human control over autonomous systems.\n\nMarko feels there is a lot of excitement about AI and a push to accelerate its implementation widely - but that it is crucial we consider AI a \u201cnifty tool\u201d to use with awareness, rather than an impeccable \u201cleader\u201d that must not be questioned. AI systems are only as good as the data inputted and the questions asked of them by humans. This means that the conclusions returned are not free of human biases, but rather potentially amplify them. Essentially, as they are used now, AI systems simply return the same results as humans would, just \u201cfaster and dumber.\u201d\n\nThis is a concern because of the rush to implement AI, particularly in the field of medicine. In medicine there is an expectation of precision, but with so many biological variables, the more precise you get the more you diverge, so large scale information potentially becomes less valuable. For example, in the 1970s, various tools were introduced to help doctors predict the likelihood of certain diseases, but attempts to refine these profiles over the years have hit a barrier. Just as you could play a lottery with 1/1000 odds every day for a thousand days and still not win, there is a crucial difference between \u201cthe destiny of the person in front of you right now, the destiny of every similar person.\u201d\n\nHis argument is not that we should not be developing AI, but that we must consider how we develop and implement it and how we contextualize the information it gives us. If we simply scale up the information we work with now without being informed about the risks, we risk causing serious damage.\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Marco here:** [What does it take to build a successful movement for citizens to gain control over when, how and to what use automated systems are introduced and used in society?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-does-it-take-to-build-a-successful-movement-for-citizens-to-gain-control-over-when-how-and-to-what-use-automated-systems-are-introduced-and-used-in-society/11075/2)\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n### AI is changing the fabric of society - it is crucial to ensure it serves people, not the other way around.\n#### A conversation with Seda F. G\u00fcrses\n\nWith an undergrad degree in international relations and mathematics, Seda is now an academic at Delft University, focussing on how to do computer science differently - utilising a interdisciplinary approach to explore both concepts of privacy and surveillance, and also looking at what communities need. They were led into this field of study by their fascination with the politics of mathematics and the biases contained within seemingly neutral numbers.\n\nThe technological landscape has changed enormously in the past few years \u2014 from static software saved on a disk that was only updated every once in a while, to software and apps that are held on services and so constantly updated and optimised. A whole new host of privacy and security issues have arisen, and thus the need for a computer science which secures and protects the needs of its users.\n\nThe negative consequences of prioritising optimisation over user experience can be seen in Google Maps and Way, which sends users down service roads to avoid freeway traffic. They don\u2019t care that this has an adverse impact on the environment and local communities, or even that it actually causes congestion in smaller roads. Further, Uber has optimised its system to outsource risk to its workers: instead of paying people for the time they work, Uber offers them a system that tells them when they are most likely to get customers so that they can manage their individual risk.\n\nWhen this kind of tech injustice is applied to public institutions such as borders and social welfare systems, the discrimination embedded in the very systems mean we are changing the fabric of society without having the necessary discussions as to whether that\u2019s something we want to do. We need to stop talking about data and algorithms and focus on the forms of government we want these technologies to have. It is crucial that the computational infrastructure boosted by AI serves people, not the other way around.\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Seda here:** coming soon\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n###  Tech is not the simple solution to complex social situations.\n#### A conversation with Peter Bihr  \n\n\nPbihir co-founded ThingsCon community which advocates for a responsible, human-centric approach to the Internet of Things. Smart Cities, where the digital and physical meet and where algorithms actively impact our daily lives, is an important focal point of his work.\n\nHe proposes reframing the Smart City discourse (currently dominated by vendors of Smart City tech) away from the technology and more towards a focus on societal impact. What better urban metrics can we apply to cities increasingly governed or shaped by algorithms? Such an analytical framework would be the key to unlocking a real, meaningful debate. Smart City policies must be built around citizen/digital, human rights, and with emphasis on participatory processes, transparency and accountability.\n\nAt the most recent ThingsCon conference, Manon den Dunnen shared her experience of unintended horrific consequences of tech going wrong when police officers take phone numbers of both victims and suspects, and then Facebook algorithms then suggest one another as friends.\n\nFurther, several studies have shown policing and/or justice related algorithms were found to have racist data points (including some deemed illegal by courts yet remained in the data sets). And the policing algorithm in NYC measures effectiveness by such simplistic metrics that created incentive for officers to report selectively (for example, the systemic intimidation of rape victims to change their charge from rape to a more minor offence).\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Peter here:** [How can we put humans/citizens first in our smart city policies?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-can-we-put-humans-citizens-first-in-our-smart-city-policies/9878/40)\n\n<hr>\n\n### Unchecked digital expansion could entrench existing biases and power inequality\n#### A conversation with Corinne Cath-Speth \n\nWith a background in human rights and policy, Corinne Cath-Speth worked as a policy officer for a human rights NGO in London before coming to the Oxford Internet Institute and the Alan Turing Institute to pursue her PhD. Her research focuses on human rights advocacy efforts within Internet governance, with a broader interest of how human rights NGOs are responding to the new (and old) challenges raised by emerging technologies. \n\nIn working with human rights activists, CCS saw that digital technologies - like social media - can give the plight of activists more visibility, but that often these same technologies entrench existing power inequalities and biases. She became interested in studying what happens when activists try to change the infrastructure of the internet itself, rather than simply use it. A number of well-known human rights organizations like the ACLU and EFF, actively do so by contributing to Internet governance fora. She found that these organizations are welcome and can operate in these spaces with relative ease, given their open and multistakeholder nature. At the same time, she also saw that while getting the tech \u201cright\u201d is an important part of the puzzle of human rights advocacy in the digital age, it is also a narrow frame through which to understand the broad spectrum of social concerns raised by networked technologies. \n\nCCS\u2019s work in Internet governance also led her to consider human rights advocacy in AI governance, as AI systems are raising a host of questions regarding privacy, safety, anti-discrimination and other human rights. One of the problems with developing AI advocacy programs is that many of these systems are developed by private companies, so it is difficult to gain access to their technology to examine and understand it. Many NGOs are therefore calling for the regulation of AI systems, but are facing pushback, with companies arguing that it hampers innovation. Yet, it is this same \u201cinnovation\u201d that encourages many governments to deploy AI systems. A drive for \u201cinnovation\u201d for innovation\u2019s sake is particularly concerning when it encourages governments to step into technologies that they don\u2019t fully understand or even need. \n\nObviously, a lot of human rights NGOs have been worried about these various dynamics for a while and are consistently raising their concerns\u2014 sometimes by bringing in academic work to show some of these issues. Human Rights Watch, for example, has a great program as does Amnesty International, Privacy International and Article 19. Several of the largest human rights NGOs are focusing on issues of AI systems and bias. But they\u2019re also forced to play whack-a-mole as the application of AI systems becomes more common. How to focus your resources? Which companies and applications are most concerning? Which solutions most tractable and comprehensive? Do we need sectoral guidelines, or do we need guidelines which focus on impact? Do we need self-regulatory ethics frameworks or hard data protection frameworks? All of the above? These are the issues I see a lot of NGOs grapple with and are questions I hope to discuss with you on this platform.\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Corinne here:** [What does the future of civil society advocacy look like, given the prevalence of these digital technologies and their impact on the work that civil society is currently doing?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-does-the-future-of-civil-society-advocacy-look-like-given-the-prevalence-of-these-digital-technologies-and-their-impact-on-the-work-that-civil-society-is-currently-doing/11118/16)\n\n<hr>\n\n### Self-reinforcing loop of data could put human rights at risk\n####  A conversation with Justin Nogarede\n\nJustin Nogarede works for the Foundation for European Progressive Studies, was previously at the European Commission focussing on competition law and European regulations.\n\nAs a trainee in the application law unit at the European Commission, he became aware of the issues involved in ensuring member states comply with EU law, finding that often there isn\u2019t the staff or resources available to enforce directives - for example, the directive on data protection has existed since 1995, but was not widely enforced. Justin now focuses more on data governance, and is finding that as new digital infrastructures are rolled out, they are driven by narrow efficiency concerns and are not accountable. Looking into these new infrastructures is a great opportunity to make the system more participatory and accountable - but we have to take it.\n\nFeeding existing data into AI systems can create problems - for example, when predictive policing has been shown to drive more officers into wealthy areas, as data shows a higher rate of arrests in those areas. Data therefore creates a self-reinforcing loop. Further, digital systems often rely on a binary logic, which healthcare and social problems simply don\u2019t fit. The key problem is that data is a simplification of the real world. Further, some AI systems may support a conservative bias, such as when they are used to predict which offenders are most likely to reoffend.\n\nRegulation of digital infrastructure would be a step in the right direction, and the argument that it would stifle innovation is weak - technological advances must make sense and make lives better. It may not be possible to have 100% compliance, but more involvement of public authorities (even at local level) would be a good step, as would more transparency over how these technologies function. Why is all this innovation not channelled into ways for people to live a better life?\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Justin here:** [Why is all this innovation not being channeled into ways for people to help them live a better life?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/why-is-all-this-innovation-not-being-channeled-into-ways-for-people-to-help-them-live-a-better-life/11443/3)\n\n<hr>\n\n### Distributed systems promise great possibilities - and challenges.\n\n##### A conversation with Hugi Asgeirsson \n\nEarlier this year, Hugi was in Berlin for the Data Terra Nemo conference, focussing on decentralised web applications which are hosted without traditional servers, allowing for a lot of interesting applications.\n\nThey were inspired by the human-centric community that has grown up around \u2018gossip\u2019 protocols like Scuttlebutt. It seems to be forming a playground where new and radical ideas can be tested and implemented. The original developer of Scuttlebutt, Dominic Tarr, describes his MO as: \u201cnot to build the next big thing, but rather to build the thing that inspires the next big thing, that way you don\u2019t have to maintain it\u201d and this seems to have set the tone for Scuttlebutt itself.\n\nOne of the core elements of Scuttlebutt is that users can host data for other people on the network without being directly connected to them. This has the positive effect that users in countries where internet usage is highly restricted can connect via other users - though on the other hand, this also means that users could unwittingly be hosting information they would rather not propagate. There have been instances of the Norwegian alt-right using Scuttlebutt to communicate. Scuttlebutt has been working to address this issue but solutions are imperfect so far.\n\nThe bottom line is that distributed systems such as Scuttlebutt are both democratising and empowering and they come with a whole new set of possibilities and challenges.\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Hugi here:** [Data Terra Nemo: First report & Scuttlebutt](https://edgeryders.eu/t/data-terra-nemo-first-report-scuttlebutt/9928/4)\n\n<hr>\n\n### Open-source technology and interoperability are key to sustainable innovation\n#### A conversation with Oliver Sauter \n\n\nThere is an accepted \u201claw\u201d of entrepreneurship: in order to build something valuable, you have to be ten times better than what already exists (as proven by Google + which arguably had better some better features than Facebook but failed to tempt people away). Why does this law exist and what can we do to change it?\n\nBlackforestBoi believes it comes down to: Costs to switch (time and mental effort) > additional benefit offered *~10. Such growth requirement has produced some great leaps in innovation - but these come with downsides. How would the world look if we focused more on incremental innovations?\n\nWhat is holding us back? The way companies make money for one: the 2nd quarter of 2018, Facebook lost $120bn (billion!) in stock value within 48 hours, the biggest loss of any company in history. The reason: It posted the least growth since its founding, while still making 5BN in profits the same quarter and growing by 42% since the last year. Secondly data and social lock ins creates counter incentives for interoperable formats which would make it easier for users to migrate between services or integrate them,\n\nBreaking this dynamic would require tackling the problem from multiple angles: namely allowing users to move freely between services, creating economic models that reward quality of service rather than simple growth, and ideally adopting Open-Source software to allow companies to build on one another\u2019s work.\n\nWorldBrain (dot) io is building open-source software in an attempt to enable incremental innovation, the foundation of which is Memex - an open-source privacy tool. Interoperability is baked deep into the core of Memex, it is fully open-source and WorldBrain (dot) io has no stock value, so is entirely focussed on building a sustainable service.\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Oliver here:** [Startups\u2019 grand illusion: You have to be 10x better than whats there](https://edgeryders.eu/t/startups-grand-illusion-you-have-to-be-10x-better-than-whats-there/10221/14)\n\n<hr>\n<br>\n\n### Civic organisations are key to turning AI technology into a force for civil justice\n\n\n##### Fabrizio Barca\n\n\nWith a varied background in banking and treasury and more recently inequalities and justice, Fabrizio previously worked at the EU and now with a civic organisation called the Forum for Inequality and Diversity.\n\nThe current crisis in Western countries is driven by inequality - in particular the paradox that we have the technology to create equality but instead it is producing an unprecedented concentration of knowledge and power in very few hands. This must be addressed by putting political pressure on the issues. State-owned enterprises and collective platforms where people can put together data that everyone has access to could turn these technologies into forces for social justice.\n\nA one-size-fits all approach to AI in public administration grows resentment. It deprives people of the most important thing - human connection and a sense of being recognised - which breeds intolerance, division and a loss of trust in democracy. Fabrizio is just coming to understand how effective civic organisations can be, not just in advocacy work but in taking action to shape services in local areas. He hopes to gain even more understanding through discussing the topics with a mix of people from different backgrounds.\n\n**Learn More :** [Conversation with Fabrizio Barca Founder, Forum on Inequalities and diversity I Ex General Director, Italian Ministry of Economy & Finance](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-conversation-with-fabrizio-barca-founder-forum-on-inequalities-and-diversity-i-ex-general-director-italian-ministry-of-economy-finance/11545/2)\n<br>\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Kate J Sim\n\nA PhD researcher at Oxford Internet Institute, katejsim studies the intersection of gender-based violence and emerging technologies. Her work focuses on issues of trust, gender and sexual politics, and the double-edged role of technology in facilitating connections but also targeted harassment. While organising against campus violence she personally experienced cyberharassment and lack of support from law enforcement. More resources have become available since then, but we need to change how we conceptualise these issues and fundamentally change the design of the platforms.\n\nShe helped to form a cross-campus network that grew to a nonprofit organisation, Know Your IX. The space requires better structures in place to support mental health and protection from cyberharassment to reduce burnout. Research shows again and again that women, especially women of colour, tend to self-censor and reduce their visibility in order to survive - it is crucial we put more safeguarding in place to protect them.\n\nDigital systems designed to facilitate disclosures, collect evidence and automate reporting of sexual assault are attractive to institutions because of their efficiency - and to some extent to victims as they are perceived to be objective and neutral. However, these systems have bias encoded in them. The designers are working with their own understanding of sexual violence, which may not match victims\u2019 experiences. Some victims don\u2019t have the data literacy or English level to work the systems, which could compound their trauma. Further, the pressure to report is encoded into the design of these systems, but this is a misguided emphasis on a single optimal solution, which is not appropriate for all victims. De-emphasising reporting and focussing on \u201csmall data\u201d driven by relationship building can create a structured conversation which is rich, insightful and telling.\n\nRather than asking how tech can be fixed for the better, the more urgent and important question is: who and what are we overlooking when we turn to tech solutions? How can we support practitioners in anti-violence space, like social workers, jurors and judges, and advocates, with data and tech literacy, so that they have control over how they interpret and act on data?\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Kate here:** [Can tech design for survivors? How sex, violence, and power are encoded into the design and implementation of data/AI-driven sexual misconduct reporting systems](https://edgeryders.eu/t/can-tech-design-for-survivors-how-sex-violence-and-power-are-encoded-into-the-design-and-implementation-of-data-ai-driven-sexual-misconduct-reporting-systems/11193/6)\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n### Focus on scalar indicators is driven by need to describe reality, not change it\n#### Alberto Cottica\n\nAlberto had been hoping that ehnography-at-scale via SSNA could integrate, if not replace, the indicator paradigm, but after trying to get people to assess their own willingness to pay for, say, avoiding the extinction of some type of frog in Madagascar, or lowering the PM10 content by 10%, he found convincing evidence that we could never trust our results\n\nHe refers to James Scott\u2019s convincing argument for scalar indicators being propelled by the modernist ideology that underpin the coalescing of modern states. This works for states but not so much for people. Modern states have created a demand for scalar indicators, but this has more to do with their thirst for administrative order than with a drive to understand what is really going on.\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Alberto here:** [On assessing impact, and what Edgeryders could do in that department](https://edgeryders.eu/t/on-assessing-impact-and-what-edgeryders-could-do-in-that-department/10708)", "created_at": "2019-11-15 11:27:14.243290", "updated_at": "2020-12-09 10:35:20.234993", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4053, "wiki": true, "reads": 20, "score": 164.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55401, "user_id": 4861, "topic_id": 10185, "post_number": 6, "raw": "[quote=\"nadia, post:5, topic:10185\"]\nhappy to meet if you are around\n[/quote]\n\nI'll just be at the festival, real busy before and after.

For example, <a href=\"http://www.romamakers.org/\">RomeMakers.</a>\n\nIt would not only function as a working space for individuals, but also host innovative NGOs and start-ups. Moreover, besides people working on their own projects, it would also create a space for the people active in the hub to come together and create projects together. To share their ideas and their skills.In addition, a place where students, kids, minorities and others can be trained in a variety of subjects to empower them: what is open sourced software/hardware, coding/programming, entrepreneurship, etc. AND serve as a space where events can be held on social innovations and other relevant subjects.\n\nIdeally, this would be located in an abandoned factory (of which there are many in Tbilisi). The idea is that the team working in the hub will together also work on the office space itself (airconditiong/heating, kitchen?, etc).\n\nWhat is the next step? That is seeing if there are interested partners to join in. In Georgia, Elva is already looking around, but perhaps the Edgeryders community can help out with examples of previous spaces similar to this idea: what are the do's and the don't's? What would you think should be a part of this?\n\nRight now a website is being set up with the main idea on it and supporters of the idea (individuals, organizations, private sector).\n\nAnother issue which might be worth exploring: perhaps together with Elva and several other local NGOs they can apply with Edgeryders for a Horizon2020 fund for this? <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>, what do you think of the idea, do you think this is something which could be good for Horizon2020 and would Edgeryders be possibly interested in working on this together?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-08-26 10:59:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:19.378176", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 406, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36716, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 7122, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Sure, happy for all the help and community we can get :) I plan on taking this project as my homework to work on in the Morocco space, so we might find time to work on it together there.", "created_at": "2017-09-20 21:28:27.080183", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 21:28:27.080183", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 38, "wiki": false, "reads": 66, "score": 68.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [36714], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59337, "user_id": 5025, "topic_id": 9881, "post_number": 54, "raw": "Super, I modded.", "created_at": "2019-09-16 07:50:37.777882", "updated_at": "2019-09-16 07:50:37.777882", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 24.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [59329], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64796, "user_id": 3206, "topic_id": 11625, "post_number": 5, "raw": "[quote=\"Nashud, post:3, topic:11625\"]\nNe bih se u potpunosto slo\u017eio da se name\u0107e sad ne\u0161to posebno u svetu, kao \u0161to je ta neka pri\u010da o izolovanosti ili bespomo\u0107nosti, ve\u0107 je to neki diskurs koji je verujem odraz ljudske nesvesti.

The empowered involvement of citizens (including the vulnerable and marginalized) and public and private organizations aims to increase the relevance of local and national decision making, to ensure buy-in from society, and to secure the effectiveness of environmental, social, economic and cultural policies and initiatives. \n\nAt the core of this journey are a series of co-creation workshops bringing together public and private stakeholders and citizen groups. These groups will be meeting periodically, circling through topics that are highly relevant for participants and the for local authority in the context of the European Green Deal.  Workshops will be facilitated by experienced professionals who will introduce leadership training, practices informed by cognitive sciences, techniques used in the cultural and creative sectors, and state of the art participatory planning procedures.  \n\nDuration: The - - - NAME - -  project will last for 4 years, and local groups will convene towards the end of the first year. The project will be able to facilitate the gatherings, under potentially different group configurations. More cities will be involved across Europe. \n\nLocal authorities and agencies are invited to host these gatherings by providing the space and infrastructure. To secure the relevance of the co-creation workshops to the forthcoming Green Deal priorities and obligations of the local authority, the project asks the support and participation of the appropriate personnel engaged in policy planning and implementation (e.g. on sustainability, culture, social engagement, or other policies that align with the European Green Deal) \n\nThe costs of facilitators, trainings, and materials will be covered by the project.  \n\nAs the proposal is under preparation, and should you wish to be involved, we would welcome your inputs regarding your needs, capacities preferences and alignment with ongoing initiatives and programmes.  \n\n --- \n\nWith the present Letter of Support [name of the organisation], represented by the undersigned [name and position of the person signing the Letter] intends to express its support for the project  - - - NAME - -  to be submitted and coordinated by IEECP  - Institute for Energy and Climate Policy, under the Horizon 2020 Call LC-GD-10-2-2020 \u201cBehavioural, social and cultural change for the Green Deal\u201d \n\n \n\n[Short description of the organisation] \n\n  \n\n[Name of the organization] reviewed the contents of the proposed project  - - - NAME - -  and shares its vision, aims and objectives, believing they can significantly contribute to local actions for the European Green Deal, supporting local public and private organisations and citizen groups.  \n\n \n\nAs part of the case study, we intend to participate in the  - - - NAME - -  project by hosting the planned stakeholder workshops and co-creation process, and by attending the training and capacity building activities made available by the project.  \n\n \n\nWe understand that our participation will be highly beneficial in designing locally meaningful policies that support behavioural, social and cultural change.

EP highlights that flagship programmes are now at risk of experiencing an immediate drop in funding from 2020 to 2021; points out, furthermore, that as of 2024, the EU budget as a whole will be below 2020 levels, jeopardising the EU\u2019s commitments and priorities, notably the Green Deal and the Digital Agenda; insists that targeted increases on top of the figures proposed by the European Council must single out programmes relating to the climate, the digital transition, health, youth, culture, infrastructure, research, border management and solidarity (such as Horizon Europe, InvestEU, Erasmus+, the Child Guarantee, the Just Transition Fund, Digital Europe, the Connecting Europe Facility, LIFE+, EU4health, the Integrated Border Management Fund, Creative Europe, the Right and Values programme, the European Defence Fund, the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) and humanitarian aid).

In the case however that a new MFF would not be adopted on time they will adopt the programmes on the basis of the existing MFF, as foreseen by the Treaty (Where no Council regulation determining a new financial framework has been adopted by the end of the previous financial framework, the ceilings and other provisions corresponding to the last year of that framework shall be extended until such time as that act is adopted).\n\nFrom the Recovery fund the money goes to the countries and the amount will depend on their national recovery and resilience plans for 2021-2023, so it will be harder to get some of that since these calls for proposals will target projects on low-carbon technologies and processes that contribute to mitigating climate change, etc. But it will depend on each call so probably there will be some possibility too within the employment, jobs, research, social innovation topics, etc.", "created_at": "2020-07-29 12:53:33.085854", "updated_at": "2020-07-29 12:53:33.085854", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 427, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [81128], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86680, "user_id": 5059, "topic_id": 14766, "post_number": 50, "raw": "@antonekker thank you so much!", "created_at": "2020-11-11 18:39:12.711726", "updated_at": "2020-11-11 18:39:12.711726", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 22.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [86677], "is_liked_by": [5479], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83858, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 13988, "post_number": 152, "raw": "[date=2020-10-09 time=14:00:00 timezone=\"Europe/London\" timezones=\"Europe/Brussels|US/Eastern\"] \u2192 [date=2020-10-09 time=15:00:00 timezone=\"Europe/London\" timezones=\"Europe/Brussels|US/Eastern\"]\n\nOK, thanks all-- please set in your calendars that we will have a biweekly call from 2-3 UK, 3-4 Europe on Fridays, starting October the 9th. \n\nWe will not be shifting or moving around these calls from week to week --- too much time has already been spent on scheduling --- so make every effort you can to make it, please. \n\nAt the beginning of the call, please also be prepared to give a short update on the content activity on your part of the platform: what people are talking about, what you're finding interesting, etc. Then we'll dive into the code review. \n\nThank you!", "created_at": "2020-09-28 09:29:40.828278", "updated_at": "2020-09-28 09:29:57.216222", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 139, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 21.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4779], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61232, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 10740, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Hello!  am interested to join  please keep me update once you schedule the call", "created_at": "2019-10-13 14:40:09.453090", "updated_at": "2019-10-13 14:40:09.453090", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 7.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [61150], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 89081, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 15114, "post_number": 2, "raw": "ok Ill ask Gustaf Arrhenius at The Institute for Futures Studies https://www.iffs.se/en/", "created_at": "2020-12-17 09:50:15.638872", "updated_at": "2020-12-17 09:50:15.638872", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 26.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80717, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 10859, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Here is another quite interesting example of co-living and co-working.", "created_at": "2020-07-20 08:53:58.659585", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 08:53:58.659585", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 21.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6442], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22602, "user_id": 809, "topic_id": 1311, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Housemates recruitment tips ?</b>\n\nThis is extremely interesting and sounds great.\n\nI would like to know : how are you going to recruit/select your future housemates ?\n\nThis is a difficult decision, because (as far as I understood) it's about a long-term relationship.\n\nSo how are you going to choose ?

What is out there to make our own biases less visible to the algorithms?**\n\n\n**How can we get emotionally engaged into the ai discussion? What do you want to push against? Where are injustices related coming out of this?**\n\nUse of AI in judicial and social welfare, like in housing projects who gets a house, based on an algorithm. But people need to have someone recognize them as a human people, But we aren\u2019t recognized as human beings anymore, discrimination grows because the human to human contact is no longer there. But the problem is that is that there are sooo many more things happening that are not implicit. The way labor was exploited in capitalism, enormous change happened. But now this is being copied again. But it isn\u2019t causing an enormous reaction. The unions are weak.\n\nCredit for a household going to banks. Information about our behaviour. Families are asked a high rate, the reduction of social justice. Where does the right-wing voter come from? There is a big job of just making clear what is happening. What happened in the State was evident, but here we lack information, children should understand.\n\nWe need to:\n\nEducate, how for bad and for good it can used\nJudiciary needs to be brought into the game\nWe need to bring back people\u2019s wellbeing into it.\nIt isn\u2019t necessarily about tech, it\u2019s about people. The solution isn\u2019t marketization.\n\n\n**in terms of mobilization and justice, perception of the actions and reactions of justice. We\u2019ve seen the same thing playing out in different places for different reasons. Obvious injustice - the link between the situation and the AI land where this is scaled up. What happens when it scales up?**\n\nlabor, women, kids, citizens, consumers. It can react to a machine, but it is also a reaction to social issues, national bargaining in negotiation of algorithms. People are coming together against the gig economy. The platform is private, its proprietary, they are angry. They know there is misuse.\n\nIn the US, if you read the amount of literature by women on gender, there\u2019s an abundance, but within the EU this is not the case.\n\nWith regards to kids\u2019 privacy, their are flashes of anger, but no movements.\n\nWith users of mobility services, there is some action from citizens. For example in Milan they are now trying to launch a platform for mobility.\n\nOn anger, you always have to have a structure. Otherwise it may be used by the wrong people or die out.\n\nSocial justice: is this algorithm being used to enhance or reduce the capabilities of humans. On all the different fields.\n\nPutting the structure on the anger. You need to turn it into a request.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking enough about the consequences. I personally do not feel threatened to automation, but many people are. I don\u2019t believe in any of the numbers that go about. What is really happening is the quality of jobs with reflection on people\u2019s lives, relations, the capacity of algorithms\u2026people are being told one day to another if they will work. This is killing their lives. The unions - representing labor, have a reason to mobilize people. If you are looking for a bomb shell I would study them more, the role of people like us. The unions are not equipped these days, we were told they are not necessary anymore, sometimes conservative. I would invest in capacitation of the union.\n\n it\u2019s like the amazon example, they weren\u2019t unionized, but they protested and had demands and got them, and unionized after. But I am stressing that labor is a large area where things come along.\n\n\n**Why are we putting the wellbeing of people behind proprietary systems?**\n\n\n\n**If actors say they need algorithms: why?**\n\n\n\n\n**What are the reasons people are unable to act upon algorithmic issues in society?** \n\n\n\n\n**Where is the space in which humans can have agency?** \n\nThe three steps: let them pay taxes; mobility of capital\n\nWe are discussing this within these constraints, because we can\u2019t change the whole world, but if there\u2019s some solidarity between the unions \u2014 organised labor, if we can give them higher capacity, and then they won\u2019t let them be abused, it is doable. They are very weak technological speaking, there is no negotiation anymore.\n\n\n**We have a lot of things like roads with are public, you can\u2019t make a private road and make it public. But for some reason, we don\u2019t have the same idea about data, and why not?**\n\nif you perceive the data is being used out of control then you are boycotting it. The results of systematic mistakes, decisions have been taken by the private corporations and when the public sector is using them it is doing for its own purposes. Talking about the problem that is not in algorithm but our pressure is taken out of context, the common discourse has taken the public sector out. Even the illusion of internet as being something out of the control of the state. The state has been wrongly used. Even in the education - the teachers in Italy weren\u2019t given explanations why they are being placed somewhere. But this is not because of the data. The algorithm was badly used.\n\n\n**Why are we buying into these systems and who hold the power?**\n\n*his own notes from the event:*\n\nIn order to move ahead and to make the most of all ideas and human resources working these days on AI, we need both to understand where potential mobilization is taking place or it might take place, and to have a conceptual framework to move ahead.\n\n* Since AI can produce either bad effects (harm) or good effects \u2026 the appropriate conceptual framework should offer a definition of bad/good so as to\n* assess current uses of AI,\n* mobilize people both \u201cagainst\u201d bad uses and \u201cfor\u201d good uses\u201d\n* design, experiment and revise alternative \u201cgood\u201d uses\n* Sen\u2019s concept of Substantial Freedom (A Theory of Justice) is a choice: the capability approach, where we consider \u201cgood\u201d all moves/actions that improve the capacity/capability of every person to do what considers valuable (not futile capacities, but central to one\u2019s life: dignity, learning, health, freedom to move, human relations, \u2026)\n* This approach does not incapsulate what is \u201cbad\u201d or \u201charmful\u201d in a rigid box, but it calls for a participatory/societal assessment of how the general principle should be implemented, an assessment that can be continuously updated through public debate\n* Not so new: it was used by lawyers in the corporate assessment of \u201cjust\u201d/\u201dunjust\u201d fiduciary duties and business judgement rule in the US\n* Which reminds us that the participatory process/platforms can be of different kinds:\n* In the judiciary\n* In working councils\n* In town councils a la Barcelona\n* Mixing dialogical/analogical debate\n\nWhich are the potential ACTORS of mobilization?\n\n* **Organised Labour**  : automation, bad jobs, gig economy, low wages\n* Women: AI machism\n* Kids: sexual abuses, porno\n* Citizens: mobility\n* Citizens: health \u2026 a dimension of life where people are becoming awareof bad uses (insurance, use of DNA)\n\nTherefore, one should move forward according to the following sequence:\n\n* Identify, country by country or even places by places, where people\u2019s concern on bad uses (or on forgone good uses) is high and there it is being organised: i.e. where there is a potential demand for \u201ccompetence support\u201d, both at conceptual and technological level\n* Concentrate on these contexts and provide them with the conceptual framework\n* Turn the \u201cpars destruens\u201d into a \u201cpars costruens\u201d\n* Building at EU level a network that allows horizontal comparison for the same issues both of threats, actions and results\n* Ensuring at EU level the availability of a competence centre that deals (not necessarily solve, but ai least identify and tackles) with the meta-obstacles preventing the implementation or curtailing the survival of\u201cgood\u201d uses.\n\nComplementary activities that emerged from debate:\n\n* Following the \u201csubstantial freedom\u201d framework a  **code of behaviour**  should be established and monitored, by which all categories playing a role in developing algorithms - scientists developing Algorithms, politicians supporting/calling for their use, public and private administrators using them - should ask themselves:  **What is the effect on the capabilities of people effected by the algorithms?**\n* Analogic/dialogic \u2026. Online/Offline  **Experimenting platforms**  combining the two is a priority. In particular, it should be a practice for public administrations and politicians to create dialogic platforms where the above code of behaviour is checked.\n* Education/sensibilization on the implementation of the above conceptual framework in order to identify good/bad uses is a priority.

I'll just take [this one](https://phys.org/news/2011-05-nuclear-power-world-energy.html) (EDIT: [Here's the best case I could find so far](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124074) based on a Sweden/France extrapolation concluding 25-34 years) that comes up high in a search for \"How fast can nuclear power scale\". It doesn't even get to the \"fast\" point because the premise falls apart even before that (granted they make some assumption you maybe would not, such as \"conventional design, uranium fed, etc.). Btw this is based a team of credentialed academics publishing in the (peer reviewed) IEEE. Not some US talk radio BS.\nBut I do you a favor and also now look at what the main pro-article is: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-nuclear-power-can-stop-global-warming/ from 2013 - that looks promising, doesn't it? Sadly the writer is just a journalist, and the article is not peer reviewed or similar, but SA has a decent reputation.\n\nI'll just dump a few points into a block point here:\n\n>a) A big problem is cost. The construction of large nuclear power plants requires a lot of money to ensure safety and reliability. [...]\nb) It's a shame that the U.S. essentially stopped R&D on advanced nuclear power a few decades ago [...] ARPA\u2013E itself, however, has no program to develop alternative reactors because of the expense of proving out novel designs and the long timescales required to develop any of them. [...]\nc) But significant hurdles remain, not least the decades required for design, licensing and construction of even existing nuclear technologies, let alone novel ideas. That may mean advanced nuclear power cannot contribute much to [efforts to combat climate change](https://www.byliner.com/david-biello/stories/reactivating-nuclear-reactors-for-the-fight-against-climate-change) in the near term, **which leaves current reactor technology as the only short-term nuclear option**\u2014and one that is infrequently employed at the global scale at present. [which would mean that the constraints in the article I cited previously would be very relevant] [...]\nd) Over the full lifetime of a nuclear power plant, that means greenhouse gas emissions of roughly [12 grams of CO2-equivalent per kilowatt-hour](http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_nuclear.html) of electricity produced, the [same as wind](http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_wind.html) turbines [IPCC says 16 for nukes vs 12 for wind and approx 1000 for coal]. \n\nThorium reactors are nice (if they really work) and you're not going to have an easy time catching me bashing nuclear research. But here is \"your side\" side shooting down your argument. Even current designs need 6-12 years to be built. How are you ever going to scale this up in time? And even if you were, we'd be stuck with really expensive 20-40 year old technology that we'd all have to decommission at similar times (there may be benefits of scale there, but also immense risks).\n\n> Correct, \u201cnot stunning\u201d is precisely what we want ([source](https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-the-safest-form-of-energy)).\n\nPlease note that the point you are making is not referencing the right part of my argument. My point was NOT that I was concerned with loss of human life (in such a metric anyway). \nWhat I meant is if you scale up nuclear to replace coal and fill in for the other renewables, statistically (to date, there have been 11 nuclear accidents at the level of a full or partial core-melt) you end up with approximately one of these for every 2 months. I have argued it would be considerably worse if you take the socio-technicnologic competency in many less developed places into account. Your counter argument for this was to name the country that had the technological resources and developed a nuclear expertise to challenge the USA after WW2 and is ranked as very high human development index. What kind of argument is that? \nPick a dozen from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index#Medium_human_development) or belwo, and have a few on there that will get hit hard by climate change. For example Bangladesh would sure like to have some nukes.\n\n> This may come as a surprise\n\nAre you sure you're talking to the right person here? Do you want to continue to do so, then I'd get on with addressing a few points that I made and ease up on the snark.\n\n> Nuclear waste storage in one picture:\n\nThat picture is indeed neat, and something I haven't got on my radar yet, thanks. \nA couple of points though: \na) 20 MWh per capita per annum is already 30% too low today, by the time we hit 10 bn people it is likely to be even worse - so the number is a tad arbitrary. \nb) Missing sources.\nc) Not everything is highly concentrated waste. How is e.g. decommissioning going to look?\ne) This is not nuclear waste **storage** in one picture, it is an illustration of a *volume* of a certain *type* of nuclear waste - and Helen.\nf) Here is a picture of actual nuclear waste storage in the oh-so-responsible country of Germany, with an oh-so-responsible nuclear industry. Strictly speaking this was a (publicly funded) feasibility study into storage, so the financial pressure and corner cutting was less than you'd have to expect when cost per MWh and raw construction speed was the driving factor: ![image|690x529](upload://vmpbmmFzggxQK1A5CM0JKII8dmm.jpeg) \n\nI rest my case, but I am looking forward to see you address my previous points, before you get to these.

Expense reimbursement process</h2>\n\nJust follow all applicable steps in all sub-chapters, in the order they appear.\n\nAnd please allow one week for the payment to happen, and the usual transmission time for bank transfers on top of that. We make our payments once a week on Mondays, with exceptions only to avoid catastrophes.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Request expense reimbursements (if applicable)</h3>\n\nThis process applies only if you have spent own, private money for third-party products and services needed and agreed by the Edgeryders company, and want to claim reimbursement.\n\n1. **Make expenses** and collect the original (physical or digital) receipts for them.\n\n2. **Digitize and aggregate your expense receipts.** The preferred format is PDF with A4 page size, but JPG and PNG images (<1 MiB) are also acceptable. To digitize the receipts, some company members use the [Expensify app](https://www.expensify.com/) to take captures and receive PDFs in their emails.\n\n    Optionally, to aggregate expenses for lower efforts of entering them lateron, you can combine receipts of the same expense category into one PDF document each. Do not create aggregates of different types of expense receipts, as that would not allow proper categorization of expenses for tax purposes. For example, travel tickets and restaurant bills should not be aggregated together.\n\n3. **Add your expense receipts in FreeAgent.** For each of your (aggregated) expense receipts, created above:\n\n    1. **In FreeAgent, click on \"Expenses\"** in the main menu to see your expenses.\n    2. **Click \"Add new expense\"** in the top-right.\n    3. **Create a new record** for every receipt or receipt aggregate (containing multiple receipts of the same expense category). There will still be only one payment to you, combined for all your records of not-yet-reimbursed expenses.\n   4. **Enter the expense type.** Between Refund and Payment - choose Payment, since that was the action you took. You did not refund anyone, you paid an expense.\n    5. **Enter the expense category.** For any expense for paid project work done by Edgeryders for a client, choose one of the \"Cost of Sales\" categories, if necessary just the general \"Cost of Sales \u2192 Cost of Sales\".\n    6. **Enter the expense date.** Should conform to the date on the expense receipt that you will upload.\n    7. **Enter the expense amount** in the currency of the receipt and upload as attachment the receipt reference. If you are claiming in a currency different than the Euro, note that we usually reimburse at the historic rate of the expense receipt's date.\n    8. **Enter the VAT amount.** Enter the amount of VAT contained on your receipt(s) that Edgeryders O\u00dc can claim back via pre-tax deduction from European Union governments. If the invoice is issued in a non-European Union country, it's simple: enter zero, we can't claim back contained VAT if any. Otherwise, if in doubt, also enter zero as the \"safest case\".\n    9. **Fill into \"Description\"** a text \"_{projectname} {expense type}_\", for example: \"OpenCare travel to Brussels\".\n    10. **Link it to a project** by filling the \"Link to Project:\" field. This is important to make our project-level accounting work.\n    11. **Upload the receipt.** As prepared previously, see above.\n\n4. **Check how much expense reimbursements you are owed.** Usually it makes sense to let expense receipts accumulate in FreeAgent until you have enough registered to make a transfer to you economical. So you need a way to check how much you are owed by Edgeryders, as follows:\n\n    In the horizontal main menu, navigate to \"Expenses\".  From the \"Show:\" drop-downs, choose your name and \"Recent\". (_The balance owed to you will only show if you choose \"Recent\"!_) Now, the reimbursements owed to you is at the bottom right of the table (row with the newest date, column \"Balance Owed\").\n\n    Another way to check the balance owed to you is to go to \"Accounting \u2192 Reports \u2192 Show Transactions\", and there select account \"905-_{nn}_ Expense Account: _{your name}_\".\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Request expense reimbursements for those without an account (if applicable)</h3>\n\n**Applicability.** If the person form whom you are registering expense claims has a FreeAgent account, do not use this process. Use the \"[Request expense reimbursements](#chap-3-2)\" process from above, as is more comfortable \u2013 it will convert currencies automatically using the exchange rate from the day of the expense, and sum up the total expense claim. It even allows, where needed, to pay people an advance for expenses they will make in the future.\n\nHowever, for occasional collaborators, event participants who are owed funded travel reimbursements etc. and anyone else who is owed a reimbursement _without_ having their own FreeAgent account yet, it is impractical and inefficient to let them register their own reimbursement claims. It is faster and simpler to create contacts and register expense claims as bills than to create users and train people how to enter their expense claim data.\n\n**Instructions.** In these cases, simply let them send you a payment request that contains the summed-up amount (in Euros), the account to pay to, and the receipts on the following pages of the same PDF document. Then register this document the same way as an invoice from a supplier. Just that it should not contain the word \"invoice\", and does not need an invoice number or other formalities.\n\n**Aggregating expenses into bills.** For what payment receipts can be put together into one bill, the same rules from above related to aggregating payment receipts apply: you can combine receipts of the same expense category into one bill. Do not create aggregates of different types of expense receipts, as that would not allow proper categorization of expenses for tax purposes. For example, travel tickets and restaurant bills should not be aggregated together.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Fixing over-reimbursements</h3>\n\nIf the company mistakenly reimbursed expenses in excess of those actually incurred, there are two options:\n\n**Over-reimbursement of a regular collaborator.** If a moderate amount was overpaid to a person who will incur other expenses in the future for the company, nothing has to be done: FreeAgent show the over-reimbursement with a negative value due to the collaborator (i.e. money due to be paid back to the company), and this credit will disappear and eventually reverse as more expense records are added over time.\n\n**Over-reimbursement in other cases.** If the amount is not moderate or paid to a one-time collaborator, the transaction should be reversed as follows:\n\n1. The collaborator who was paid the extra money should refund it via bank transfer.\n\n2. The Edgeryders payment manager reconciles the original money out transaction:\n\n    1. Split the original transaction into two smaller transactions ([instructions](https://support.freeagent.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001217610)).\n    2. Reconcile one of the two, for the amount actually due to the collaborator, as \"Money paid to user \u2192 Expense payment\".\n    3. Reconcile the other, for the remaining balance, as \"Other money out \u2192 Payment from contra account\". The contra account is just a transit account used for housekeeping.\n\n3. The Edgeryders payment manager reconciles the incoming transaction made by the collaborator in favor of the company as \"Other money in \u2192 Receipt into contra account\".\n\n_TODO:_ There might be a simpler process, somehow utilizing the \"Type: Refund\" setting when making an expense claim.", "created_at": "2018-10-01 22:21:32.786151", "updated_at": "2019-05-28 14:44:19.474048", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1331, "wiki": true, "reads": 26, "score": 215.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52165, "user_id": 5000, "topic_id": 9649, "post_number": 23, "raw": "Hi matthias and everyone.\n\nThe Directive was Approved but there is still time to do something.

When the WHO says that, they are saying it the most careful of scientific language. In fact, most experts on coronaviruses believe that it's highly likely (I've even heard it phrased as \"almost certain\") that there will be enough immunity so that subsequent infections will be mild. Two of the worlds most experienced scientists on coronaviruses, [Stanley Perlman](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-602/) and [Ralph Baric](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-591/), were interviewed on the This Week in Virology podcast recently to explain what we know about this family of viruses and this one in particular. As both of them explained, immunity is not binary. There are four coronaviruses endemic to the human population, and we have some immunity to all of them in that when we catch them they just give us a common cold.\n\nIf herd immunity is in fact not possible, we are in much deeper trouble. It is completely impossible to contain and eradicate this virus at this point. Islands like New Zealand can do it temporarily at great cost, but as soon as they open their borders, they will have it again. I personally think it's futile. If herd immunity isn't possible, then no vaccine is going to help us either. In that case, we can really only hope for one of two things; either the virus mutates to a less deadly variant that outcompetes the deadly strains, or we come up with better medications and treatment protocols to help us live with it.", "created_at": "2020-04-27 17:41:30.289424", "updated_at": "2020-04-27 17:43:12.239455", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 287, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [75199], "is_reply_to": [75199], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62245, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 11022, "post_number": 29, "raw": "The env file naming in your Vue.js application is automatically including the deployment environment?

However it has to be made clear, and the current crisis makes it more obvious than ever that the existing system of subsidies, regulations and everything that goes with it has never been made in order to support food sovereignty or any small business including family farmers. So we must not count on that. After years of work on EU regulations and policies I can tell you NONE of this policies does support local farming, organic farming, sustainable practices and so on. Even if there is some \"greening\" going on, even if some family farmers do benefit from subsidies, and there was certainly some money allocated here and there, this is just totally ineffective while 95% of funds go to support the exact big industries that are destroying the planet and the rest is subject to heavy administrative control. So everything has to be totally rebuilt from scratch because at the current point those regulations are so bad it is not even possible to reform them. We have spent years and years of trying to have a better greener Europe and all we have is our best organic farmers struggling for survival not even because of lack of funds but because they face too much obstacles from taxes, regulations, sanitary norms and other. At the same time, the ones that get most of the money are those who spray the fields with bee killing pesticides and want to plant GMO crops all over. And the danger now comes not only from taxation but from crazy sanitary regulations which are killing for example small scale pig breeding while terrible industrial farms with thousands of animals kept indoors are still allowed, no problem.  So I do not want to sound pessimistic people, but the systemic change will not come from current governments or EU institutions, or it would only be for the worse. To built sovereignty and independence we must first of all organize locally and as much as possible invest in our communities. Which is very difficult as we have been now dependent from that same overcentralised and over controlling system and never learned to cooperate and support each other. And let's also make it clear, there is no such thing on the planet Earth as free trade or free market. So it is somehow a mistake to think we live in a neoliberal world, while it is forbidden to buy seeds from your neighbour, but it is mandatory to buy them from a big registered seed company. The system has been designed by the big players to exploit the small ones, and this is nothing really new. But still 75% or more of the food is actually produced by small farmers. So yes, we should focus on communities, yes we shall network and built local strength, and yes the money must be reinvested in a completely different way. We need a complete reset and that won't be easy.

Her work focuses on issues of trust, gender and sexual politics, and the double-edged role of technology in facilitating connections but also targeted harassment. While organising against campus violence she personally experienced cyberharassment and lack of support from law enforcement. More resources have become available since then, but we need to change how we conceptualise these issues and fundamentally change the design of the platforms.\n\nShe helped to form a cross-campus network that grew to a nonprofit organisation, Know Your IX. The space requires better structures in place to support mental health and protection from cyberharassment to reduce burnout. Research shows again and again that women, especially women of colour, tend to self-censor and reduce their visibility in order to survive - it is crucial we put more safeguarding in place to protect them.\n\nDigital systems designed to facilitate disclosures, collect evidence and automate reporting of sexual assault are attractive to institutions because of their efficiency - and to some extent to victims as they are perceived to be objective and neutral. However, these systems have bias encoded in them. The designers are working with their own understanding of sexual violence, which may not match victims\u2019 experiences. Some victims don\u2019t have the data literacy or English level to work the systems, which could compound their trauma. Further, the pressure to report is encoded into the design of these systems, but this is a misguided emphasis on a single optimal solution, which is not appropriate for all victims. De-emphasising reporting and focussing on \u201csmall data\u201d driven by relationship building can create a structured conversation which is rich, insightful and telling.\n\nRather than asking how tech can be fixed for the better, the more urgent and important question is: who and what are we overlooking when we turn to tech solutions? How can we support practitioners in anti-violence space, like social workers, jurors and judges, and advocates, with data and tech literacy, so that they have control over how they interpret and act on data?\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Kate here:**  [Can tech design for survivors?

In the end, we have a virus that is arguably alarming enough to require some actions for prevention of its spread. Is it too much hysteria and fake news? Yes.. and I can't disagree with you on this:\n\n> Overall I believe the responses/anti COVID measures put in place are disproportionate and in general a result of very bad judgement. I believe they will kill more than COVID. I believe they will cause a lot more long term damage, both mental and physical, on a very large amount of people.\n\n> Do you believe a nobel prize winner for his work on HIV is talking nonsense when he says that covid19 was artificially modified?\n\nHonestly, I don't know anything about this and will look into it, but it won't change how happy or not I am with government measures, you see? \n\nAll in all, I think responses and public reactions to this pandemic are hardly rational. There's something about a pandemic that's not the same as having similar no. of deaths from a serious disease - there's just general panic (amplified by the news yes) and it hits you in your primal fear. When I think about my family and my older grandma, I would much rather that they are strict about protective measures, whether it's to stay home and not go to work, or always wear a mask, than risking deadly scenarios. Yes, my grandma has other afflictions, but if she can live a couple of more years than die of covid+comorbidity factor, I'll take it.. and she'll take it.  This reasoning could continue all the way to ''but what if we could have access to clean, clear, truthful information and best readings of numbers, and only the 'real' experts in the media and our families needn't sacrifice so much?'', then of course it's a dire situation to be in.  But you see what I mean..\n\n> I believe also the authorities would be more clear about the difference between a mask and face covering. Mask would protect us more but making us all cover our faces increases social distance and is a great exercise in social obedience\u2026\n\nYes, agreed", "created_at": "2020-10-17 08:15:40.276288", "updated_at": "2020-10-17 11:20:39.904699", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 477, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 18.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [85069], "is_reply_to": [85069], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32389, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1681, "post_number": 24, "raw": "<b>Hard to disagree</b>\n\nHey (Petros?), thanks for sharing this.

We've seen more honest exchanges and better public-civic partnerships, and heard some good personal stories. Last year we tried our most radical exercise to date - convincing cities to earmark a public space for grassroots, informal community experimentation (read more [here] (http://www.eurasia.undp.org/content/rbec/en/home/blog/2018/can-creating-a-web-between-digital-and-physical-spaces-give-agen.html); see pic below).\n\nAmong the many things which work and don't, we noticed an important thing: innovative roles were played by individuals who were not necessarily in senior public sector positions or did have specific mandates to be \u2018innovative\u2019. It became clear that sympathetic, open-minded, dynamic civil servants and other officials can be fundamental enablers of change, as they discover new ways to step outside citadels of restrictive and regulated administrations and work more effectively with external partners in civil society and the private sector.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/beb4c195a01d0e049e9b7f824a986f4d869273c7.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n_Meetup in the central park of Rustavi (Georgia), where a civil servant intermediated a takeover of park areas by the community, which organised several actions - festival, social cafe, zebra painting, skaters' contest and other fun activities.

Following a keen interest of UNDP Istanbul Regional Hub to continue this line of inquiry, we are now co-designing a program, a Hackers Bureaucrat Fellowship network which would aim to:\n\n* Acknowledge and celebrate innovators in public administrations across many countries, types of public sector organisations, and interests.\n* Encourage them to continue on their path by creating an associated 'fellowship program'. Fellows are nominated not only on the basis of what they have achieved in the past, but largely on the basis of what they are trying to achieve for the future.\n* Permanently connect them into a wide peer-to-peer support network with feedback loops and horizontal and cross silo multiplication for enhanced impact.\n* Put innovative practice on the radar of senior management, with increased recognition of innovation as a key factor in promotion.\n* Mobilize a movement of public servants who design and execute novel solutions for stubborn policy issues, indirectly addressing issues of decreasing legitimacy and trust of citizens in institutions, effectiveness of governing and development.\n\n@Alberto @Bob @Elami5 @Mao @Nadia and I will be in Turkey end of the month to meet people whose experience is valuable to shape this new program. If you know of champions or unsung heroes pushing the boundaries of what is possible in a bureaucracy and blazing the trail, talk to us.

By comparison, [TransferWise](https://transferwise.com) has the more transparent fee structure, as indeed they calculate with the mid market exchange rate and list everything else as the transfer fee. And since they added more destinations recently, esp. Nepal in 2018-03, we have no reason left to use Azimo._\n\n_&nbsp; In addition, like most UK financial institutions Azimo now has hilarious nanny-state style know-your-customer policies that they implement with zeal and fervor in such a way that even @matthias got both his private and commercial Azimo account permanently blocked.

How to use Azimo for Edgeryders](#heading--2)**\n\n**[3. Applicable restrictions and limits](#heading--3)**\n\n------\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. Introduction</h2>\n\nAzimo is a UK based money transfer service that we should use for most or all transfers outside of SEPA (the \"Single European Payment Area\") because:\n\n* It's faster (immediate for cash pickup, 24 hours plus country-internal bank transfer time for a transfer to a bank account).\n\n* It shows the exchange rate before, and offers a better exchange rate (still not the mid-market rate though but about 4% less).\n\n* It has lower fees: always 2.99 EUR per transfer. In contrast, bank charges plus exchange rate losses can easily reach 40 EUR for a 400 EUR transfer in such cases, esp. when sending money to \"developing\" countries.\n\n* It allows various methods to receive the transfer, also allowing to send money to people without a bank account (depending on the destination: bank account, cash pickup and / or mobile phone top-up).\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. How to use Azimo for Edgeryders</h2>\n\n1. **Create an Azimo account.** Create it under your own name, at [azimo.com](https://azimo.com/en/).\n\n2. **Initiate the transfer.** on azimo.com. Fill the forms as follows:\n\n    * **Payout type.** You can choose from various modes of payment, but _do not choose SWIFT_. It will cost additional fees, so that unlike with all the other options, the recipient would get considerably less than you send (even 20 EUR less). Also, SWIFT is just the same process as a normal transfer between bank accounts, so we don't need Azimo for that. The screen to select the payment mode should look for example like this:\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ab4f9a01a29c80c547e945846b708fbdc4c5966e.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"393\">\n\n    * **Payment amount.** Look at the comment field or else, at the attached invoice file of the FreeAgent record for the payment to make to see if the original invoice is in EUR (which is preferable for us) or in a national currency.\n  &nbsp; If the invoice is in EUR, enter the payment amount in EUR \u2013 very straightforward. If it is in a foreign national currency, enter a EUR amount first, go to the next screen, and adapt the national currency amount as needed. _Do not_ simply enter a EUR amount converted from the national currency as found in FreeAgent \u2013 this uses a different conversion rate and will cause the recipient to receive abotut 4% less than invoiced.\n\n3. **Fund the transfer.** Send a bank transfer from the Edgeryders bank account to the account indicated by Azimo when you initiated the transfer at their website.\n\n    (Details: The bank account is in the SEPA area and EUR denominated, so it meets Azimo's requirements. You could also try with the Edgeryders credit card but these payments are harder to manage in our accounting, and more importantly Azimo documentation says \"The credit card has to be issued on the name of the Azimo account holder, otherwise payments will be delayed or refused.\")\n\n4. **Adapt the FreeAgent record (if needed).** In case you are paying an invoice issued in national currency, go back to the FreeAgent record and adapt its EUR amount according to what you sent to Azimo. The previous value was preliminary as it is not known before what exchange rate Azimo will use for the transaction.\n\n5. **(For the first transfer:) Prove you can pay on behalf of Edgeryders.** For the first transfer, and _only_ the first, Azimo will follow up with an e-mail requesting documents about the Edgeryders company. This is because they need to confirm that the Azimo account holder is the CEO, a director, a board member or proprietor of the company / organization, due to \"know your customer\" (KYC) regulations.\n\n    For that, send them an official document, showing all the directors of the company (it is not required at this stage that the document also shows the shareholders). For that, sending them the freely available, current \"The printout of valid registry card information in English\" as PDF, together with instructions how to obtain it themselves, will likely be enough. To get this PDF:\n\n    1. Visit the [Estonian e-Business register](https://ariregister.rik.ee/ettevotja).\n\n    2. Search for company information by enterig our company registration number, 14213857.\n\n    3. Click the link \"The printout of valid registry card information in English\".\n\n    4. Click the \"PDF\" button in the top right.\n\n6. **(For one future transfer:) Inform Azimo about the Edgeryders shareholders.** After several transfers with a certain aggregate turnover, they will send an e-mail requesting \"a detailed list of all current shareholders (with 25% or more in shares), directors, partners and trustees\". It is sufficient to send this in text form, with names and addresses of all Edgeryders O\u00dc directors. No need for proving this with any official document.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Applicable restrictions and limits</h2>\n\n* **For Nepal.** You cannot transfer more than 690 EUR to Nepal for cash pickup in one transaction. There are no issues with splitting up a larger amount into multiple payments, though. (Source: Azimo live chat support to @matthias.) You cannot transfer more than 5650 EUR to bank accounts in Nepal in one transaction. When sending to a _company_ in Nepal, you can only send via \"SWIFT Transfer\", and only in USD and only if the receiver account is in USD. Receiving banks may charge extra fees.

What do you feel necessary from EU to participate?\n\nAlberto: I\u2019m a bit skeptical that legislation is the right instrument to do this kind of things. It\u2019s a blunt instrument, because as of now there is no good understanding of the process from the ethical values (fairly easy to encode in a directive) to the actual technical choices of the scientists and engineers building AI systems. Ex. we like the New Zealand group developing Scuttlebutt: when users asked for cross-device accounts, the core developer replied \u201cI\u2019m not doing that, because we want to serve underprivileged people, and these people do not have multiple devices\u201d. What he was doing was justifying his technical choices in terms of his values. As a socio-technical culture, we are not good at that. \n\nLegislation is not an efficient tool?\n\nNot yet. \n\nMarco: Human centered internet is not defined, that\u2019s why you can\u2019t find a solution. \u201cHuman\u201d is literally anyone. \n\nAl: It\u2019s more about the process and accountability\n\nIf you look at insurance tech, they\u2019re good at \u2026 \n\nSeda: Why are we pushing for AI? The end of Moore\u2019s law. The money we seek in are more unlike to come back. Industry took a risk at specialised chips: AI and blockchain-specific. So, now they need to create a demand for these chips. We should be aware of the vendor-driven nature of this stuff, and think about how to regulate these companies. \n\nPart: there are a lot of people involved in AI now, we\u2019re not in the moment of choice, \u2018cause a lot of people are already working on it. Could you give us a definition of what is human centered AI? What kind of tech could give a real improvement in the social field?\n\nPart: All the company are now working in AI. There\u2019s who believe it and go for it no matter what, and there are people who are more aware of dark sides and brings other issues. In the medical field AI is useful to diagnose common diseases. When you get down to it, AI is just statistical models. \n\nModerator: could you please better define what \u201cinvestment in AI\u201d is? What should the EU do practically? \n\nSeda: The business model of Big Tech now is based on keeping the code, providing cloud services and collecting data to profile and ultimately influence users. They cross-subsidize their cloud services with their marketing revenue streams. If you want to fight that, you should have public cloud infrastructure, which is a trillion-EUR affair. That\u2019s your investment in human-centric AI infrastructure.\n\nCompanies like Google optimise with AI the profilazione of their customers. The difference is if it\u2019s a data centered AI or not. \u2026 ? Where do we bring the democratic process into new models?\n\nPart: informed consent is tricky for a company to manage. \n\nPart: In the health care sector, public data have been simply entrusted to large companies: the NHS in the UK chose Deep Mind, the SSN in Italy chose IBM Watson. \n\nPArt: People republic of Walmart, how data gov. enables them to use \u2026? The structure is from biology, human brain: do we actually need AI? I think so. Human centric should be human empowering, not exploiting.\nBig tech should be redefined as AI companies, and no longer Internet companies, and regulated accordingly. Also, they claim to be \u201chuman centric\u201d, because they build sophisticated models of human behavior; but to me they are not, because they do not empower humans.  I agree with the point made before about accountability. The GDPR also enshrines it. \n\nPart: Ecological impact of AI: simply training AI models has huge impact in terms of CO2, it might not be a win-win situation, but a tradeoff. You solve some problems, but at the cost of making climate worse. \u201cGovenment is accountable by default\u201d (mh). But people is generally unwawre of using AI.\n\nAlberto: climate + competition policy = nobody is allowed to grow to much. What is \u201cempowering\u201d? I suspect that AI (ML applied on big data) is inherently NOT human-centric, because its models (for example a recommendation algo) encode each human into a database, and then models you in terms of who you are similar to: for example, a woman between 35 and 45 who speaks Dutch and watches stand-up comedy on Netflix. Everything not standardizable, everything that makes you *you*, gets pushed to the error term of the model. That is hardly human-centric, because it leads to optimizing systems in terms of abstract \"typical humans\" or \"target groups\" or whatever.\n  \n\nMarco: I agree with the antitrust principle. What we consider AI is machine learning, this is the root of our problems, it\u2019s just classical statistics. You create the illusion that value production is shifted to the generation\u2026. ex. if the doctor establish a relation with the patient, the AI has not to invade the relation, but now the doctor has to take notes and patient see less value in it (you look somewhere else and you are centralised\u2026). \n\nAirport before and after Ryanair: before architecture were associated to functions and your experience of travels, room for different functions. Now with the low cost you consider that the experience is less valuable, now is a shopping mall and at the gate it\u2019s temporarily informations about space. \n\nAlberto: Are you saying that, in order to have standardization (and therefore data analysis), we have to \u201cflatten\u201d patients on the dimensions that are comparable across different patients? \n\nMarco: medicine is not diagnosis, but prognosis-based. In medicine, nothing has value if I cannot improve your life. A patient can and should negotiate with the doctor where to go from here; he or she even has a right to die. This is a very poor fit for how ML-on-big-data works. \nModerator: Because we expect thousand of data, we loose the human specific? \n\nAlberto: \n\nPart: New tech are not working on average, but on very personalized experience, so it\u2019s not statistics. \n\nMarco: I just read a review of 37,000 studies of AI in medicine. Of these, only about 100 had enough information on training datasets to do a meta-analysis on. Of these, 24 claimed prospective design (the algorithm had been trained without knowing the real data); of these zero had actually done prospective design. \n\u2026 I don\u2019t know any real medical problem that prospective AI model can solve. \n\nSeda: We optimize relationships. This is problematic. For example, we have marketing companies working with civil liberties organizations, that tell their clients: we can tell you which of your donors care about which issues, so you can optimize for issues where you get more money. \n \nOptimisation has been the logic as far, but it can go wrong anyway. Traffic is a perfect example. If you look at optimization system, it comes at a cost and if you don\u2019t do internalise the cost it causes bigger damages. Apparently innocent choices as what to optimize for turn out to have huge consequences. When you design traffic, do you optimize for driver safety? Or for pedestrian safety? Of minimize time spent on the road? \n\nSEDA on feedbacks: I know GDPR, it\u2019s regulated anyway. There are serious problems on how GDPR focuses on personal data on individuals.\nWe talk about automated decisions, but there is a set of criteria \u2026 the optimization is not about the single person, but as pbe part of a certain group which operates certain choices in general. So, you expect to empower people, but actually you don\u2019t. Paul Olivier Dehaye is trying to pool data from different workers to see if people are being discriminated. This is called a \u201cdata trust\u201d. There is also the DECODE project that is doing something they called \u201cdata commons\u201d. \n\nWe are now in a mess with the GDPR. Uber, for example, uses it to refuse to give drivers their data, saying this impacts the rights of the riders. This (says Seda) is the consequence of focusing on personal rights when the data are used to optimize over populations. \n\nDATA Trust + \n\nPart: I am in the MyData community. We really like the GDPR per se, but we take issue on how it is enforced. In the US there is a project called Data Transfer, that is setting the standards for personal data in a way that will entrench dominant positions. Pragmatically, the EU should set its own standards for this.\n\nPart (Rob): In Belgium there is a company called It\u2019sMe, who does online identity. They are pushing their data onto Azure, making it GDPR and EIDAS compliant. That changed my thinking, because it showed me as even these sterling silver pieces of European thinking ends up in the Silicon Valley cloud. \nWe need to break the number-person relationship: when you get born, you receive a number from the state, and the game\u2019s up. I dream of disposable identities, that we set up with the purpose of entering into a relationship, like for example receiving a service. A good analogy is one-time email addresses: you get an email address, you sign up to some online service with it, use it ONCE to receive the email to confirm you do control that email, and then it self destructs.\n\nGovernance instead of government. Here\u2019s my take: the kind of society you are looking at is anarcho-communist. The communist part is that infrastructure is fully centralized, like in the 30 glorieuse. Anything that runs onto the infrastructure is fully permissionless. That\u2019s the anarchist part. And finally, the data stays with the people. \n Justin sees the Internet as an accelerator of neoliberalism, Rob as a still-young tech that is fundamentally liberating. \nIdentity is a process, so a \u201cbroken\u201d identity in different objects, is not a problem.\n\nCan we think of counterproductive regulation on the Internet? Stuff like the copyright directive? \n\nJustin: let me reframe that: how did we end up with all these things, that used to be a public good, end up being someone\u2019s property? \nCAPITALISM values, and measures, commercial transactions, so there is a fundamental, systemic incentive to bring things into the commercial sphere. \n\nRob: internet changes the ratio of power. We behave like we are in the pre-internet era, because internet is a new technology and it takes longer for us to change behaviours. \n\nPart: In the MyData community we see data being commodified, but we think this is a mistake. Data are relational: my birthdate is also the date when my mother got her first child. A mistake in regulation could be this; create a kind of freehold right on personal data (again the parallel with IPR holds). \n\nthe error is to internpret GDPR as individual private data. What is data? It\u2019s a relational thing? \n\nStructure defines content. It has been premeditated that \n\nAlberto: in Helsinki everybody agreed that you can\u2019t sell your data. \nRob thinks that a radical change is coming, want it or not, and that the ONLY thing that can secure a good outcome is very multi-faceted: innovative procurement, plus hardcoded GDPR, plus disposable identities, plus permissionless-friendly data standards for IoT. \n\nPart: In Europe people value privacy, My friends in Malaysia, they don\u2019t think much of agreeing to foregoing privacy rights to get access to some online service. China also is much more top-down than Europe is.\n\nPart: coders and programmers are new \u00e9lite who understand how these subjects affect society\n\nKenya + AI?\n\nJustin: new laws will come out next year about AI in EU. What are the best things that we could do? What is the progressive outcome of this process?\n\nPart: teach data skills and data literacy, early in life? \n\nPart: could we maybe stand in the middle, where data can be both used as an economic resource or as a human right. \n\nPart: in NYC there is a situation with an algorithm that does something, but it is proprietary, and so no one exactly knows how it makes the decisions that it does. A good idea is to mandate auditability of algorithms. \u201cAlgorithm watch\u201d is an NHO that does this. \n\nPart: is it possible to audit models? It is, though very expensive. So why does it not get done? Because the algos are private property. \n\n\n## Fishbowl 2: Featuring Fabrizio Barca, Kate Sim, Hugi Asgeirsson, Liliana Carillo - facilitated by Nadia E.N\n\n### Notes from Fabrizio Barca\n**Some ideas from good exchanges in a good evening \u2013 November 11, 2019**\n\n(Fabrizio Barca)\n\nIn order to move ahead and to make the most of all ideas and human resources working these days on AI, we need both to understand where potential mobilization is taking place or it might take place, and to have a conceptual framework to move ahead. \n\n* Since AI can produce either bad effects (harm) or good effects \u2026 the appropriate conceptual framework should offer a definition of bad/good so as to\n\n* assess current uses of AI, \n* mobilize people both \u201cagainst\u201d bad uses and \u201cfor\u201d good uses\u201d\n* design, experiment and revise alternative \u201cgood\u201d uses\n\n* Sen\u2019s concept of Substantial Freedom (A Theory of Justice) is a choice: the capability approach, where we consider \u201cgood\u201d all moves/actions that improve the capacity/capability of every person to do what considers valuable (not futile capacities, but central to one\u2019s life: dignity, learning, health, freedom to move, human relations, \u2026)\n* This approach does not incapsulate what is \u201cbad\u201d or \u201charmful\u201d in a rigid box, but it calls for a participatory/societal assessment of how the general principle should be implemented, an assessment that can be continuously updated through public debate\n* Not so new: it was used by lawyers in the corporate assessment of \u201cjust\u201d/\u201dunjust\u201d fiduciary duties and business judgement rule in the US\n* Which reminds us that the participatory process/platforms can be of different kinds:\n\n* In the judiciary\n* In working councils\n* In town councils a la Barcelona\n* Mixing dialogical/analogical debate\n\nWhich are the potential ACTORS of mobilization?\n\n* **Organised Labour** : automation, bad jobs, gig economy, low wages\n* Women: AI machism\n* Kids: sexual abuses, porno \n* Citizens: mobility\n* Citizens: health \u2026 a dimension of life where people are becoming awareof bad uses (insurance, use of DNA)\n\nTherefore, one should move forward according to the following sequence:\n\n* Identify, country by country or even places by places, where people\u2019s concern on bad uses (or on forgone good uses) is high and there it is being organised: i.e. where there is a potential demand for \u201ccompetence support\u201d, both at conceptual and technological level\n* Concentrate on these contexts and provide them with the conceptual framework\n* Turn the \u201cpars destruens\u201d into a \u201cpars costruens\u201d\n* Building at EU level a network that allows horizontal comparison for the same issues both of threats, actions and results\n* Ensuring at EU level the availability of a competence centre that deals (not necessarily solve, but ai least identify and tackles) with the meta-obstacles preventing the implementation or curtailing the survival of\u201cgood\u201d uses.\n\nComplementary activities that emerged from debate:\n\n* Following the \u201csubstantial freedom\u201d framework a **code of behaviour** should be established and monitored, by which all categories playing a role in developing algorithms - scientists developing Algorithms, politicians supporting/calling for their use, public and private administrators using them - should ask themselves: **What is the effect on the capabilities of people effected by the algorithms?**\n* Analogic/dialogic \u2026. Online/Offline **Experimenting platforms** combining the two is a priority. In particular, it should be a practice for public administrations and politicians to create dialogic platforms where the above code of behaviour is checked. \n* Education/sensibilization on the implementation of the above conceptual framework in order to identify good/bad uses is a priority. It should first of all engage kids from a very early age: a new saga of cautionary tales \u2026 would help.\n\n### Ad verbatum notes from Inge and Marina\n\n\nWe all started in the same situation that we are trying to control\n\nAI may be fuzzy concept\n\nFabrizio Barca:\n\nPublic administration, research, now working with the public administrations\n\nIf we want to shape the common sense five or ten years from now what will be considered relevant?\n\nTechnology leads to bad or good results: Principle of social justice\n\nAmartya Sen\u2019s principle of substantial freedom, a sustainable substantial freedom. We need to have capacity/capability to live the life we want\n\nAs worker, I want it to help me to avoid discrimination in subjective interviews, but not to be used to have AI discriminating against me because of previous behavior of \u201cmy\u201d group\n\nMy freedom should be enhanced\n\nPutting on the table simple methodology that allows us to understand the just and the unjust\n\nThis kind of principle is not the one we take out, it\u2019s a methodology, an open-ended principle - it can be filled with content, case by case only through the participatory mechanism.\n\nDifferent subjective values of different contexts can lead to conflict- case by case through participatory processes is the solution - not just regulation\n\nWe slowly develop what we consider to be just\n\nNadia E.: one entry point is principles, we need general principles about what we consider good or bad. AHow they will look like or work in practice that\u2019s a big open question. Kate Sim has been looking at the tools - what is your experience?\n\nKate Sims: I look at automation and documentation at violence registration, do universities offer support system in trauma informed interface, your claim will go through it, run it through all other cases, and then match it with all the other cases..\n\nI have problems explaining the problems these problems have. What these systems are doing, they are trying to categorize our experience of misconduct in binary options.\n\nYou have to have a clear definition of rape otherwise it doesn\u2019t fit in the system\n\nPeople are shoe-horned into particular categories, but this doesn't speak to the richness of the experience you have had.\n\nWith criminal justice we see how people are categorized. Wider categories of human improvement are not classified.\n\nThis is where the question of civil society is very important, its difficult to understand how AI makes decisions, categorizes us, and we can\u2019t anticipated. We don\u2019t even know where the data comes from and who it is being sold to.\n\nPeople don\u2019t have the tech literacy to question this. Should citizens have this knowledge?\n\nWhat harm is and what freedom can be?\n\nNadia: the conversation started around the time of swedsh elections, we saw the clear threat from microtargeting, external influences...we started having conversations with political parties, that was a disappointment. Wanted to use this for their campaigns.\n\nDrew from the experience of mobilizing people. Wanted to dig into your experiences\u2026\n\nHugi: I\u2019m more into that if we know what is wrong how we can mobilize people and now we are about what is the thing that we are mobilizing about.\n\nA lot of the time when people are faced with systematic conversation or binary boxing in for example: Employment models aren't working, you can\u2019t break out of those and you have to work with others these new ideas to making it work.\n\nYou can only break through these models and narratives by working together and creating new narratives.\n\nWhen we know what we want to do and where to go, we can create a new future, something completely different from what the AI is predicting perhaps. Thus create the space that is more free.\n\nParticipatory art - the art that throws away the separation between art and the spectator. Because of the consumerist society...the point is not to create \u201cgreat art\u201d but great transformative experience together with other people. Example of the Borderland. They come into this world, change the mindset, lots of the traditional concepts start to break. Creating completely new reality. Tackling the imposed machine. There is something there but don\u2019t know what.\n\nLiana: The individual needs vs individual capabilities, and the collective needs and capacities. One person may be fooled by a system, like cambridge analytica.\n\nElections, Cambridge analytica, Facebook\n\nAlgorithms like Facebook are pulling us into a certain bias. Gathering data and classifying a person based on a lot of data around. If I am moved from one reality to another, the categorization of me is probably not the same. Even in a certain culture. Behaviour and constant interaction influenced by culture.\n\nIf myself am less biased the algorithms are less likely to classify me.\n\nWhat is something you are struggling with? What is out there to make our own biases less visible to the algorithms?\n\nHow conscious I am myself about my own bias.\n\nKate: it is really easy to respond to this, oh, maybe if I only share part, than that could be a meaningful intervention. Sometimes it can be. Mozilla for example has add ons. We can do that individually.\n\nBut maybe the scope of our change should go beyond individual actions.\n\nContent moderation in books by Mary Gray or Sarah Roberts - tracking the work on how tech companies more their content moderation work to India for example, the workers are paid at the low rate and required to impose western standards on what the behaviour on social media should look like. The norms are being translated by the economic models of the platforms\n\nThe scale is so much bigger than us.\n\nWhat are some of the lessons that the civil society has done in the past looking at the ways we can translate this\n\nHugi: it\u2019s even worse, it\u2019s American. The EU is not a weak player, it doesn\u2019t require the American economy to be stronger than the EU economy.\n\nParticipant A: concept of social justice & mobilization\n\nTechnological transition is making society more anonymous. Pushes individuals to be more lonely and therefore more vulnerable. A discriminating specific groups. So we are more vulnerable. But I am also sure there are examples of digitization helping mobilization and doing good. As an empowering tool for citizens to matter, like with Edgeryders. It can generate communities\n\nPaul:\n\nBelgian citizen, working for My Data Control (?) based in Finland, looking at the NGI technology\n\nPeople become the owners and agents over their own data. The Great Hack. Fair use, data economy. An ethical data operations on a global scale, with a decentralized system, fair european data economy, we\u2019re currently colonized - europe only has 3% market share\n\nData economy there are 4 models: Lanlard: you\u2019re money is worth up to 20.000 euros (??). Three other models, like in barcelona, NGI calls it decode. They consider data to be common good of a city or community. There are 4 different types of these data economy model\n\nHugi: something as vague as my data became very big, most people understand there is something about data we should care about. We only need this data once, which later becomes governed by something different. The algorithm becomes irrevocable. How do you challenge that? Even if you own your data people will sell it.\n\nPaul: Mymobility, own your data. People are not really aware that they can manage their own data. Energy and transportation has the east sensitive data.\n\nInform the civil society and create new business model\n\nNadia: how can we get emotionally engaged into this ai discussion, like extinction rebellion has done with the environment. What is the spark, what was the trigger. How can we get that propelling force within this question of AI. Where are there currently very active pockets of people pushing on topics, not in the mainstream, picking very interesting fights.\n\nKate: a few examples:\n\n* a group in LA - Stop LAPD surveillance, automating inequality, ranging from criminal justice, homelessnes...to uncover the ways in which algorithms are used for surveillance. People got together to demand that the police releases surveillance policies. They were able to uncover the full scope, pushing back against the LAPD. Intervention takes a long time and needs a lot of work.\n\nNadia: The question is what do you want to push against? Where are injustices related coming out of this?\n\nFabrizzio: this example as many US example, use in judicial and social welfare, like in housing projects who gets a house, based on an algorithm. But people need to have someone recognize them as a human people, But we aren\u2019t recognized as human beings anymore, discrimination grows because the human to human contact is no longer there. But the problem is that is that there are sooo many more things happening that are not implicit. The way labor was exploited in capitalism, enormous change happened. But now this is being copied again. But it isn\u2019t causing an enormous reaction. The unions are weak.\n\nCredit for a household going to banks. Information about our behaviour. Families are asked a high rate, the reduction of social justice. Where does the right-wing voter come from? There is a big job of just making clear what is happening. What happened in the State was evident, but here we lack information, children should understand.\n\nWe need to:\n\n1. Educate, how for bad and for good it can used\n2. Judiciary needs to be brought into the game\n3. We need to bring back people\u2019s wellbeing into it.\n\nIt isn\u2019t necessarily about tech, it\u2019s about people. The solution isn\u2019t marketization.\n\nHugi: in Lebanon and Morocco - riots over something related to the AI. in one case taxing, banning of whatsapp. Because of income? Maybe. But whatsapp also introduced the signal protocol. What it took for people to go to the streets and protest against government was for their rights to be removed (those they didn\u2019t have a few years back).\n\nNadia: What are new principles for rights that have emerged? Flaws in the tools people are using; the relationship to data - economic exploitation; pushing back against infringements on their digital life. People push back when something happens. Where would you react? When was the last time you got mad when something has happened in your digital life?\n\nKate: comparison between the EU and the US is very important.\n\nPART 2:\n\nRoberto: don\u2019t know much about tech and AI although really interested. Trying to think of experiences, personal ones. We looked at the relation between the social struggles, justice movements and technology from some specific angles but maybe there are others interesting to explore. The example of whatsapp touches upon our digital freedom but there are also examples of movements that used the tech and even social networks to structure and expand their capacity to mobilize people for a cause. The most debated issues in Europe now is migration and in Brussels we have an interesting example - citizens platform to support the refugees and not documented migrants. In the matter of a few years, those were just people who felt it was unacceptable to leave people sleeping outside without any support or institutional mechanism or police. People felt they could do something, started mobilizing by using Facebook as a main way to connect. It grew very fast, various pages of the movement. Most of these people are actually engaged, besides being active on Facebook, they use it to organize the activities in real life. Now the NGO was created.\n\nNadia: interesting point of entry because in terms of mobilization and justice, perception of the actions and reactions of justice. We\u2019ve seen the same thing playing out in different places for different reasons. Obvious injustice - the link between the situation and the AI land where this is scaled up. What happens when it scales up?\n\nFabrizzio: labor, women, kids, citizens, consumers. It can react to a machine, but it is also a reaction to social issues, national bargaining in negotiation of algorithms. People are coming together against the gig economy. The platform is private, its proprietary, they are angry. They know there is misuse.\n\nIn the US, if you read the amount of literature by women on gender, there\u2019s an abundance, but within the EU this is not the case.\n\nWith regards to kids\u2019 privacy, their are flashes of anger, but no movements.\n\nWith users of mobility services, there is some action from citizens. For example in Milan they are now trying to launch a platform for mobility.\n\nOn anger, you always have to have a structure. Otherwise it may be used by the wrong people or die out.\n\nSocial justice: is this algorithm being used to enhance or reduce the capabilities of humans. On all the different fields.\n\nPutting the structure on the anger. You need to turn it into a request.\n\nNadia: In NL deliveroo drivers won a court case, but the company is ignoring it. Even enforcement is a challenge.\n\nParticipant B: For people to react, in most of the cases people are blind, they don\u2019t know it. People find it normal. They are not aware. And people have the right to know about the data. What is the next step? We should perhaps be aware of the algorithm. This is probably the next step in data protection.\n\nNadia: Talking about algorithms and making it visible, the companies will say this is our intellectual property, are there examples where the state has gone in and put similar claims?\n\nParticipant B: It is always coming back to different interests.\n\nNational security question: for health and safety issue\n\nHugi: maybe five years ago FB opened its graph and it opened up FBs capabilities. I was having a blast with it, was a party trick for me. This is what cambridge analytica used. We were able to be coming our own CIA\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s not only does it give us more capability, but what do we use these capabilities for. Maybe some have too much responsibilities with it?\n\nKate: Why are we putting the wellbeing of people behind proprietary systems. There\u2019s an example of care in the states, where due to an algorithm peoples care was reduced from 8 to 4 hours. But they didn;t want to explain how the system worked. But they were violating the rights of these people.\n\nAnother state in the US: employment benefits - combining two different data sets, the system wasn\u2019t able to sync the system together so people weren\u2019t able to receive unemployment benefits. Companies will always hide behind the trade secrecy, but why the state considers this should be above human rights? Why do they say they need algorithm?\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1. if actors say they need algorithms: why?\n2. What are the reasons people are unable to act upon algorithmic issues in society\n\nP.B: They should at least disclose something.\n\nRoberto: If we trust private companies with those responsibilities, why should we not give people that responsibilities\n\nHugi: the problem here is that all of this data exists and all of it sudden was opened. It is important to distinguish it was just the side effect.\n\nLiana: the problem isn\u2019t the algorithm, We have a tool: like a knife, it can be used for cooking in the kitchen or killing someone. Same with algorithms. Algorithms and the engineers cost a lot of money.\n\nParticipant C: It\u2019s not only the engineers, it\u2019s the data. It comes back to what do you want to do with the data. To have masscale data you need to have the right systems. I used to work in a data dep for marketing purposes. I know how difficult it is to use the data, because it is seldom up to date, There is one assumption that the information in the system that is right, but it is not, and this is worse. You get even more changes that the decisions are made wrong. If you use masscale data, in the US, a lot of people didn't realize that their data was used by FB and then they realized it wasn\u2019t correct data, outdated, or just wrong. And there is no reflection in reality, Things change. And people don\u2019t want to be categorized and don\u2019t put in the right information. For all types of reasons, you\u2019ll have the wrong data.\n\nFor me what struck me in Belgium recently, there was a discussion about participatory leadership, people from public were selected, but the people were ready to have their data given out for public health for the public good, but not for other reasons. So the question should be: what should we want to use our data for, for public good> In exchange, as a citizen you have the responsibility to give correct data.\n\nFabrizio: if you perceive the data is being used out of control then you are boycotting it. The results of systematic mistakes, decisions have been taken by the private corporations and when the public sector is using them it is doing for its own purposes. Talking about the problem that is not in algorithm but our pressure is taken out of context, the common discourse has taken the public sector out. Even the illusion of internet as being something out of the control of the state. The state has been wrongly used. Even in the education - the teachers in Italy weren\u2019t given explanations why they are being placed somewhere. But this is not because of the data. The algorithm was badly used.\n\nParticipant C: What you are saying is that people aren\u2019t taking their responsibilities. It\u2019s a question of governance and responsibility.\n\nParticipant D: The question is about how do we use the artificial intelligence, how do we trust the results, how de we use the results?\n\nHugi: AI gives advice to human, and human pulls the trigger. Just because we put a human in the middle, the decision won\u2019t be better. We are terrified of being held responsible for the wrong decisions,. So great there is this computer system that is helping us make them, wonderful.\n\nNadia: we go to the topic of agency. Trying to figure out what is the space of agency available playing field for the individual...there are points in which the human decides and points in which decisions are made for humans. Where is the space in which humans can have agency? How to think about it?\n\nSeda: We are trying to understand new systems and optimization of their functions. What happens when the system causes externalities? optimization systems make population wide decisions. Giving a bunch of signals - example of uber (feedback loops, to maximize their profits). The app sensing cars - getting you out of the traffic. Caused problems in smaller streets. The app wasn\u2019t able to change the algorithm, the municipality can\u2019t do anything. The citizens install roadblocks as a solution. Can we build systems to help people against optimization systems. POTs. Facebook matching people to the advertisers - people are subjected to data getting to them regardless of how they interact on the platform. Agency is very limited because it\u2019s about the whole infrastructure.\n\nHugi: my friend jokes always, how would a teenage obstructer going to behave, like ana anarchist cookbook for it\n\nSeda: We are not into gaming the system but more protecting. Like with pokemon, it only used to show in whiter neighborhoods, because of the ingress game which it was founded on, which was only used by early adopters. But people gamed it with gaming their GPS etc. But that shouldn't be the solution. Things are more effective if they belong to you. And now they don\u2019t\n\nI read about this game where you run a zoo, and everybody tried to podify the game, but they always had a few pigs in their zoo they couldn\u2019t sell.\n\nNadia: if you were to go through the question, what is the set of questions to be asked?\n\nSeda: We can think together, two constraints or examples that are worrying: one is soft bank, even if you complain a lot there is a huge investor, can you as a bigger union get enough leverage against the power capital? The other - company wasn\u2019t able to compete with the big actors in relation to residential area (?)\n\nHugi: are we not being radical enough? If we put a censor anywhere out in a place, including a car, and that data MUST be completely public. If we make these legislations\n\nSeda: we can maybe make a local app that can sorta compete, but it won't survive, it doesn't have the capital, the other has.\n\nHugi: we have a lot of things like roads with are public, you can\u2019t make a private road and make it public. But for some reason, we don\u2019t have the same idea about data, and why not?\n\nNadia: child pornography and security and terrorism? These are kind of as nuclear bombs when you put them in the conversation. In all of these situations there is some element that has implications or facilitates something from the counterpart, or could end up with child porn being passed out. The default of parents sharing photos of their children, why is that not seen as potentially facilitating child trafficking etc. the rationale of the conversation changes. What changes how we look at this stuff, what are the potential bad scenarios? What are the horrific scenarios that can come up? There is a limit to imagination to what can happen.\n\nLiana: we have image recognition, we can create images, so if an algorithm is able to shape \u2014 it is possible and that is scary for em as a parents\n\nKate: we already have that, we already have these systems. But we need to ask different questions, we need to ask a fundamental question: why are we buying into these systems and who hold the powers. Individual agency is extremely limited, so we need to look collectively at taking action.\n\nFabrizio: not talking enough about the consequences. I personally do not feel threatened to automation, but many people are. I don\u2019t believe in any of the numbers that go about. What is really happening is the quality of jobs with reflection on people\u2019s lives, relations, the capacity of algorithms..people are being told one day to another if they will work. This is killing their lives. The unions - representing labor, have a reason to mobilize people. If you are looking for a bomb shell I would study them more, the role of people like us. The unions are not equipped these days, we were told they are not necessary anymore, sometimes conservative. I would invest in capacitation of the union.\n\nParticipant D: it\u2019s not unions, because people don\u2019t recognize themselves in ti\n\nHugi: this was always the case, people don\u2019t recognize themselves in it and start something new, and it starts all over again\n\nFabrizzio: it\u2019s like the amazon example, they weren\u2019t unionized, but they protested and had demands and got them, and unionized after. But I am stressing that labor is a large area where things come along.\n\nNadia: pushing it forward, we have a sense of the scale at which things can go badly, and a sense of what that may mean to a physical ability to survive. What does it mean that families are threatened on a Sunday to work.\n\nHugi: people have abilities, and people are upset, we have network systems, if people would map out all the uber drivers ad ping them, they will do something.\n\nSeda: workers at amazon wanted to a strike, but amazon knew and got 200 extra people, so they could continue., After that they created another warehouse, so it couldn't be disrupted.\n\nThere are going to be local wins for a bit, but it will take a bit for a larger win.\n\nFabrizzio: The three steps: let them pay taxes; mobility of capital\n\nWe are discussing this within these constraints, because we can\u2019t change the whole world, but if there\u2019s some solidarity between the unions \u2014 organised labor, if we can give them higher capacity, and then they won't let them be abused, it is doable. They are very weak technological speaking, there is no negotiation anymore.\n\nHugi: we are from Sweden, no minimum wage, negotiation between unions, but at some point the legislation was put in place which allowed them to lower that power. We have to make sure that at the EU level these companies can act in this way. We need to find out what those things are.\n\nNadia: to bring it together, a central point of action is labor duties, and what they need to be able to be equipped with, not only to articulate, but also to coordinate, in a decentralized manner\n\nHugi: we can take labor out, but we can look at it in general as collectives\n\nSeda: The most of the work in the AI is the migration and race. We shouldn\u2019t go just the labor way. The migrants are getting organized but they don\u2019t have labor unions.\n\nKate: There is not going to be a single collective that will resolve this.\n\nNadia: It is an engineering thing as well: making visible how that discrimination or a thing affecting that group is invisible. The exclusion and marginalization are not necessarily visible. There are no special mechanism protecting a certain groups.\n\nHugi: gender has become more visible in the last ten years because the perception changed. The oppression that comes with capital is something that became visible with the social movement. Things can be made visible.\n\nParticipant E: Doing the job of uncovering the \u201cevil\u201d is particularly relevant to mobilize people sensitive to certain topics. Because things started to be uncovered, there are little movements against the mainstream, but they cannot reach big mobilization and become a mainstream. This you can only have through the positive message. We should feel we have a common fight. The issue has to be about values that we want to see and subscribe to. We need to touch upon these feelings that make us feel uneasy, but always accompanied by the feeling where we want to go, empathy and the feeling of sharing, otherwise the mobilization won\u2019t happen.\n\nNadia: not sure I agree. Hong-Kong as an example, a fight to the end. A driving force...I\u2019m gonna leave it at I don\u2019t know. An organized labor and organizing labor - the point that popped up.\n\nRoberto: Social and environmental conflicts are touching upon our lives, this is not directly labor.\n\nNadia: It is to sum up how the conversation went - making things visible, being aware that there is an algorithm. This is the first step.\n\nGetting money on snitching others\u2026\n\nThe bigger things picking up on this. I would encourage us before we leave to take five minutes, pull out your notes, think of questions. Tomorrow I\u2019ll send you an e-mail and you can contribute with your notes. Calls for action - we will be looking at things that emerged.", "created_at": "2019-11-28 12:20:42.863263", "updated_at": "2020-12-13 18:10:41.755896", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7235, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42204, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8165, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The opencare project finished at the end of 2017. In Year 2, it continued to pursue its three objectives.\n\nThe first: **explore the potential of communities to design and deliver care services**. \n\nThe second: **explore the implications of all this for policy**. \n\nThe third: **generalize from the provision of care services to the provision of anything**. \n\nHere is what we learned.\n\n\n### The potential of communities to design and deliver care services\n\n**Communities have great potential for providing care**. We knew this from year 1, and year 2 only reinforced it. A swarm of community initiatives, most of them small, addresses health and social issues. Powered by collaboration, they achieve incredible results.\n\nIn Greece, they build tens of clinics with no money, no staff and no legal existence to treat, for free, anybody who has lost their right to public health care. In France, they develop a cheap, open source device for ultrasound diagnostics. In Ireland and Kenya, they build networks of mutual help for people with mental health issues or traumas. \n\n**Many of them** \u2013 most, even \u2013 **contain elements of innovation**. Innovating communities take full advantage of small size, independence and closeness to the problem. Taken together, you can  see them as a decentralized system that innovates in all directions at once. A bus kitted as a mobile studio for trauma counselling. An ultracheap modular system for people in refugee camps to build their own furniture. The list goes on and on. Community innovators are \"crawling the solution space\" in a way no organization could.\n\n**At the heart of this effort is the desire for autonomy**. The protagonists of opencare want to be independent from failing systems. They want care services to treat them like adults. They want self-sufficiency, and the power to effect change. As a result, many initiatives address mobility issues, or skill sharing and education. The goal is always to empower the individual, through a community effort. \n\n\n### Implications for policy\n\n**Care by communities can be the R&D lab of care provision**. Failure in a formalized health care system is very expensive; in community care initiatives, it\u2019s typically low. This makes these initiatives a natural space for trying novel solutions.  \n\n**However, regulation \u2013 as much as we need it \u2013 has a stifling effect on innovation**. As a result, communities of care and policy makers have a problematic relationship. The former try to build things that are clearly benevolent, but not always legit. The latter are unsure whether to repress, to turn a blind eye, or to unofficially cooperate.\n\n**Cooperation between communities of care and public sector actors is far from the norm. But it does happen in the wild, and we were able to replicate it** in the course of opencare (the City of Milan is a partner in the project). \n\n**We have advice for policy makers wishing to integrate open care in the European health care system**. It boils down to: \n\n1. Measures that make it easier to start open care initiatives.\n2. Measures to help the successful ones to thrive.\n\nThe first item include tax deductions for private contributions to NGOs in care; creating  business labs and incubators for non profits; extending the liability insurance of care professionals to when they operate outside of their workplace. The second item can be summarised as \"cooperate, don't co-opt.\" Do not try to bring open care initiatives into formal care institutions. Rather, support them on their own terms.\n\n\n### The inner workings of collective intelligence\n\nhttps://youtu.be/G_DoEa3lcBE\n\nIn year 2, we continued to explore the inner workings of collective intelligence in action. Year 1 had left us with four conclusions:\n\n1. **Collective intelligence has structure, and a network science approach can detect it**. In opencare, we represent it as semantic social networks. These are a special kind of network, that encode information about both social interaction across people and semantic interaction across keywords, or \"codes\". In year 2, we discovered that the SSNA method is fairly scalable. This is because we can describe even a very large conversation with a limited number of codes. The strongest connections (those that keep resurfacing) form a \"backbone\" of the conversation. We explored techniques to filter semantic social networks, to get to that backbone.      \n\n2. **It's all about humans**. Collective intelligence is interactional. So, the highest-impact technologies are those that help bring people together, share knowledge, and distribute human resources across different contexts.      \n\n3. **Collective intelligence dynamics can be encouraged with (some) success**. opencare was able to start and steward a large scale conversation from scratch. The online conversation alone has over 330 participants, almost 4,000 contributions and over 800,000 words. Coding it required almost 6,000 annotations and 1,250 codes. **This makes opencare one of the largest ethnographic studies ever**. In year 2, we introduced new ways to engage participants and systematised our engagement strategy. Much of our effort went into making sure that we were being fair to participants. We concluded that many participatory processes are extractive.\n\n4. **The interface between online and onsite collaboration environments is a single point of failure, but it's also critical for innovation**. We discovered that, by participating in (often online) communities of interest, people come up with new ideas. At times, they form result-oriented communities to execute them. This happened several times in opencare. For example, when a biohacking lab in the USA posted about its efforts to produce an open source protocol for making insulin, other labs in Belgium and Cameroun offered to help. This resulted in a global collaborative effort.     \n\n\n### Things we did along the way\n\nThis journey took us through interesting waypoints. Among them:\n\n* Build an [interactive dashboard](https://bit.ly/graphryder) for exploring semantic social networks.     \n* Provide expertise and facilities to develop and prototype several devices to help mobility-challenged individuals. A wearable device that calls for help (InPe); a mobile ramp for wheelchairs to access shops (OpenRampette); and many others. \n* Co-teach three design courses in Berlin (Edgeryders) and Milan.      \n* Organise community events. In year 2 we organised a community festival in Brussels and a final conference in Milan. All partners were involved.  \n* Publish a template of a fair social contract for participatory projects.      \n* Contribute to defining good practice for publishing ethnographic data as open data.     As far as we know, no one has ever published open data of this kind before. In year 2 we published a much enlarged and improved dataset .      \n* Publish several papers). More publications are under way.          \n* Be ourselves open. Our main coordination channel is accessible to all on the open web.

This is the first reason I already very much appreciate the exploration of creating and using online platforms as a potent tool to create and develop a dialogue and values independent from the location of the participant. Since 2010, as mentioned in the previous post I, as many of our generation, especially those curious to explore and interact with other cultures and ideas adopted the &ldquo;modern nomad lifestyle&rdquo;. I have lived in different cities with very interesting cultural landscapes and encountered many very different people and situations. However, in a certain sense we &ldquo;nomads&rdquo; are often very much removed from long term political influence and participation, even as european citizens inside the european union. This is the second reason I very much approve of and would like to be part of the development of an crossborder dialogue and tool for ideation meant to lead to concrete development of an internet that has the characteristics of openness, inclusivity, transparency, privacy, cooperation, and protection of data that enable it to become a valid and constructive tool for cultural dialogue and political participation across borders.\n\nI identify much more as an european than as a german citizen and was shocked when experiencing the brexit referendum while living in London. Even so I was &ldquo;there&rdquo; I, as many others could never deemed that outcome possible, since nobody in our circles and bubbles would have been in favour of Brexit. But it became everybody's, ours, my reality. (I worked through this feeling of impossible parallel realities triggered by those unfortunate elections of 2016 for example with a sculpture drawing parallels between the many worlds theory of quantum physics and the effects of those elections (at least emotionally). The research for that piece let to very interesting discussions for example on using quantum computing for absolute secure and private election protocols. I am very interested in scientific and technological development and triggering ideas and speculations how to apply those i future and believe this is one example how speculation and creative exploration as well as interdisciplinary dialogue could trigger ideas and innovation.\n\nHow ever the main point regarding Brexit and Trump in this context is still that the Internet was very much used as a tool to create those realities, and that was possible because it lacks those characteristics NGI want to develop. 2016 shocked me deeply and personally by making me question my understanding of reality and Europe and I would love to be part of a project that thrives to develop the Next Generation Internet as a tool for constructive, inclusive exchange, participation and connection rather than intransparent control and division.\n\nAs mentioned, I worked on multiple projects with the helen hamlyn centre for design which during which I used speculative and inclusive design thinking to create interactions and discussions with challenging real users to develop innovative or thought provoking concepts, one of which included for example how to make digital information more accessible for elderly non yet tech savvy citizens through the inclusion of physical interaction points and &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; of everyday items.\n\nThrough my studies I am very familiar with the exploration of new technologies for meaningful communication and have personally always especially emphasised the connection of digital and physical interaction and experiences. I discussed the notions like &ldquo;human digital vs Digital Humans&rdquo;, emergent behavior, communication theories their importance in an Information Society and alternative and speculative approaches with my peers in the &ldquo;Information Experience Program&rdquo; at the RCA in depth as such discussions and explorations are at the core of the programm.\n\nI am also familiar with the concept of speculative design to explore futures as established by Dune and Raby at the RCA. Their PPPP diagramm (Possible, Plausibele, Probable, Preferable futures) was a integral part of dissertation &ldquo;Blending Layers, Shifting Views&rdquo;.\n\nMany of my colleagues from the IED programm are very passionate and interested and some of the actively exploring issues of AI, inclusiveness or privacy.\n\nMy older friends have a rather diverse background and add perspectives from tech , physics, ethnography or civil service to such discussions.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this would be a good connection to make and deepen :).", "created_at": "2019-03-13 16:57:47.278429", "updated_at": "2019-03-13 16:57:47.278429", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 775, "wiki": false, "reads": 43, "score": 73.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [51610], "is_liked_by": [4022, 4970], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53240, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 9865, "post_number": 5, "raw": "I'll be there.", "created_at": "2019-05-08 14:58:20.366043", "updated_at": "2019-05-08 14:58:20.366043", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35975, "user_id": 3769, "topic_id": 6888, "post_number": 12, "raw": "thank you", "created_at": "2017-09-11 11:40:56.318309", "updated_at": "2018-01-01 19:06:53.278015", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 35.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [35927], "is_liked_by": [4056], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85149, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14602, "post_number": 4, "raw": "no it's fine, Ill let my campaign run for this one (food in Poland, Czech Republic and Serbia) \nMaybe you can go Belgium since its aligned with the beanlife stuff, no?\n\n![Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2020-10-16 a\u0300 11.55.12|690x442](upload://rWeZ1zbAU1F9uzCb3p2vjiNeEgq.png)", "created_at": "2020-10-16 09:56:28.816284", "updated_at": "2020-10-16 09:56:28.816284", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 46, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 2.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85147], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61938, "user_id": 5185, "topic_id": 11174, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hej, dzi\u0119kuj\u0119 za mi\u0142e s\u0142owa.\nPotwierdzam Twoje spostrze\u017cenie, \u017ce s\u0105 na \u015bwiecie rejony, gdzie przyznanie si\u0119, \u017ce jest si\u0119 osob\u0105 niewierz\u0105c\u0105 budzi zdumienie i to nieliche.

What stories can you share?\n\nLet's start with Edgeryders :) I've been a participant on the ER platform since 2013. More recently, like Rachel, I attended LOTE 6, the Open Village Festival, and talked with most of you, so I'm not exactly an unknown quantity! Reflecting on the NGI Vision (as there isn't an explicit \"mission\" page) I find myself right in the middle of almost everything, enthusiastic about many aspects of this work. So where to start?\n\nI have a long history in bridging between the technology and the human dimension. My PhD crossed between human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence; since then I have continued to work between the realms of the human, the technical and the business, being fluent in each of the associated languages. My attitude all along has been to find ways of ensuring that the technology helps to open and develop the human potential, rather than restrict or constrain it, as it often sadly has. \n\nMy work in the development of open standards touches on openness and transparency, as well as this core theme of technology supporting people and their concerns. I've led the development of two technical interoperability projects: one in the UK, about e-portfolio information (\"Leap2A\"), and another European ICT Standardisation Expert team on representing skill and competence frameworks (\"InLOC\"). They are related to each other, and related both to \"human potential, mobility and creativity\" and to a \"value-centric, human and inclusive Internet for all\". I have had my name recorded as a contributor to a few other technical interoperability standards.\n\nIn recent years I have immersed myself in several of the social networks in areas related to the NGI. As well as (internationally) Edgeryders, the P2P Foundation, and the Human Networks Convergence network, in the UK I have been involved face-to-face and over web-based platforms with groups such as: Cooperative Technologists (CoTech); the Collaborative Technology Alliance; the Digital Life Collective; and many related networks. I've interacted with many of these groups over Loomio, Discourse, and sometimes Slack, Riot and other forums. Last year I tried to be involved in the formalisation of governance of the social.coop Mastodon instance -- part of what is often called the \"fediverse\" -- and learned rather suddenly about some of the current challenges -- from the points of view both of an individual user and a moderator -- of interacting over that kind of setup. Thus I have a intensely keen and personal interest in helping people develop constructive approaches to dialogue where they do not have personal face-to-face interactions. One aspect of this is in facilitating online forum members to meet up \"in real life\". \n\nAs a participant in online forums, I have notice time after time that I can contribute greatly to the quality of discussion and enquiry. I guess this comes from an attitude of openness, interest in others and their ideas, and being able to ask interesting and stimulating questions. My PhD work taught me, among other things, about the limitations of working alone, and the futility of believing that there is one answer. Work as a teacher and lecturer developed my initial presentation communication skills, but now I value good dialogue and collaboration most highly.\n\nConsensus (or \"consent-based\") governance and conflict resolution are areas where I have been particularly active in recent times. The cohousing community I live in has engaged with NVC and Restorative Circles as ways of addressing the inevitable conflicts arising in a largish, fairly diverse intentional community. This experience has given me so many insights into the challenges of openness, trust and resilience in human relationships, whether face-to-face or online. Developing my active listening skills has been a key part of this. \n\nI am convinced that if we are to build the \"Next Generation Internet\", we have to pay more attention to human values, human communication and human needs. As we deepen our understanding of the society that we want to create, will we be increasingly able to design and build the technical tools that will help towards a just and sustainable world.\n\n### Is your own network of colleagues and friends involved in technologies, issues, policies orgs or projects in harmony with the NGI mission where they have a deep interest and involvement that furthers one or more of the goals of the NGI mission such as openness, inclusivity, transparency, privacy, cooperation, and protection of data?\n\nIn as many online places as possible, I use the username \"asimong\", so searching on that gives some idea of my \"digital footprint\", the networks I am involved with, and where I have contributed.\n\nAs mentioned above, my cohousing community is keenly involved in working with strongly held values around sustainability, sharing and the future of the planet. It is governed by consensus. \n\nI am a founding partner of a small worker co-op (Cetis LLP, also managed by consensus) that engages in consultancy, research and development in the broad area of learning technologies, and with that comes a lot of exposure to the issues of data protection and privacy (for learners), and openness and cooperation in terms of technology and standards development. My work with Cetis, since 2002, has resulted in a large network of contacts particularly in the field of learning technologies, where my special interests have been e-portfolios, skills and competences. I wrote a book on e-portfolios that was published in 2009.\n\nSee my CV at http://www.simongrant.org/self/prof-cv.html", "created_at": "2019-03-13 15:12:30.611657", "updated_at": "2019-03-13 15:12:30.611657", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 933, "wiki": false, "reads": 46, "score": 179.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4022, 2915, 4, 4970], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64809, "user_id": 5748, "topic_id": 11664, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I am Ondra, I live in Prague, and I am currently a personal director of a dance school InDance, recently have been Secretary general of International Young Naturefriends.\n\n**What drives you and motivates you in the situation in your country? Or what frustrates you so much that you just can\u2019t let it be? (if you\u2019re an activist, or a person engaged in some kind of struggle, or you see something very specific not working properly in your community/family?)**\n\nI think, despite some general sentiments, frustration and \u201costalgy\u201d in the Czech society which brought in 2013 to power populistic movement ANO and, paradoxically President Milo\u0161 Zeman (who was in background of a lot of what frustrated people who voted for him afterall), Czech Republic is on a good path towards becoming a well-developed Western-style country. However, those described trends are pushing against this tendency. I believe that it is a struggle between the conservative part of the population, the older people still raised during communist times, and the younger people of my generation and younger, but we can \u0301t rely just on this.\n\nI think most of the challenges our society faces, are connected with this - e.g. we can adapt to the climate change (draughts etc.) way more efficiently, when there is a good will for that and ability to take the personal responsibility. I wouldn \u0301t say I am an activist. It \u0301s hard to instigate my heart into strong topics and generally I have always been the \u201cinvisible leader\u201d in the background - rather using my rational skills for writing projects etc., so people with stronger desires could have space for being activists. Sometimes I am even a bit cynical about this. My approach is rather psychological than political - we need to work on cultivating ourselves, on our ability to accept our inner shadow, and therefore the responsibility for our actions, which will then allow us for efficient social change.\n\n**Since we\u2019re trying to understand the political context and why people vote for populist politicians in the Czech Republic, I\u2019d like to ask why are these so appealing these days? What needs, dreams, ambitions do they promise to fulfill?**\n\nI think there \u0301s almost no constructive ambition - they simply promise to keep things as much as they are, as possible. Kind of like pretending that there is no time floating and we can stay the way we always were - no immigrants, no need to learn new technologies, no need to adapt ourselves to anything. \u201cGive me your voice and shut up,\u201d is a paradigm those people will gladly accept, since it takes the personal responsibility from them, and they are just fine with it. Some old people have never grown up from being children, and they are a great target groups for the populists. You can see it now with Mr. Babi\u0161 who is himself acting like a child with all the affairs, the trial that is on him etc. - just kicking things away and screaming, but those people don \u0301t see it as a problem, since that \u0301s exactly the approach to the responsibility they would take themselves.

But also I'd say that currently, crisis mode project management is very, very rare. People can't do it, can't stand it. Because professional and private life are now two separate spheres only connected by a flow of money (like this: :hourglass_flowing_sand:). And in crisis mode management, there is no private life anymore \u2026 . For a short time that can work, and be great actually, but not for years. The exception is war, but I'm not proposing that.\n\n[quote=\"trythis, post:12, topic:12131\"]We just have to make something that works well for [groups of 5](https://youtu.be/3hwR6vQHiUY?t=1281).[/quote]\n\nThat's really interesting. Just today I though that the current structure in Edgeryders is a growing hierarchy with multiple levels already, most of them still kind of informal. Management becomes a nightmare then, as information and processes get lost and degrade on their way up and down the hierarchy. Self-contained teams of five (basically like military \"squads\") that tackle one part of a project on their own would fix that.\n\nAlso interesting: The 2 + 3 = 5 structure of groups sounds reminiscent of a family structure: a couple and three kids old enough to assist / help, while other kids might be also there but mostly as receivers of care. That analogy would fit well with a proposed hard-wiring of the brain for such a mode of collaboration in groups of five. There are perhaps other hard-wiring limits in the brain, each indicative of its own mode of biologically ingrained collaboration.

First, SSNs are meant for human consumption, and not as a system for computers to efficiently store and retrieve information. Second, and as a consequence, they are underpinned by a simple ontology, that can easily fit in human short term memory. Our chosen representation has only two types of nodes, participants to the conversation and ethnographic codes, and only three types of edges, comments (participant-to-participant), references (participant-to-code), co-occurs-with (code-to-code). By contrast, graph databases (proposed as early as 1971 [Shapiro, 1971]) can and do encode many types of relationships\n\nMethod is related but is not that \n\nDistinguish what we are doing and how it differs from \u201csemantic social network\u201d as it is used \n\n* Basically co-occurrences network building from documents\n\n* They look like social networks built like social interactions between people, but they are not \n* Not just fact that words happen in the same document \n* Social and Semantic Coevolution in Knowledge Networks by Roth and Cointet. Analysis looks similar to what we do, but:\nMAJOR difference: their data are built using NLP + a reduction of what they call \"concepts\" done by domain experts. So, it is not an ethnographic method.\nMAJOR difference: the focus of the paper is structural, in the NetSci tradition. They don't care what scientists are actually saying in the network of co-authorship on zebrafish embryology. They are interested in figuring out how individual behavior produces network structure. Our focus is on the effectiveness of SSNA to help us interpret large-scale ethno corpora, i.e. what they actually mean. It is semantic, not structural.\nLess major difference: they keep the graph as bipartite instead of projecting.\nYou cannot actually use this method to distill what people are trying to say-- you can only use it as a way to understand how these two dimensions (social and semantic) interact.

However, at least half responded that they grow plants or do a little gardening. This only goes to say that work around the household falls usually under hobbies, and that in the city people like to have a little green corner on the balcony, or improvised terrace.\n\n## Group work where everyone is a designer: We departed from individual experiences, but very quickly discussions arrived at the \u2018HOW\u2019: how those in The Reef would live together, how would trust be built, and which values, principles and processes could support healthy behaviors at the collective level.\n\nThe consensus was, like in the first workshop, that you need minimal principles on which people would agree from the start. We decided not to call them rules, because not abiding by rules involves punishment, which goes against the idea of acceptance of the other. But we need principles because \u2018if you don\u2019t set the base, you can\u2019t change things\u2019, said Ilaria.\n\n\n**Key insight: Living green relates to both individual and collective behaviours**\n\n Living green is not about the technology as much as one would think. @matthias pointed out that you can have \n> the best tech and people could still waste energy or viceversa: you can save 80% energy through behavior, even if you don\u2019t have the green building. \n\n![the%20reef%20habits%20fooding|690x530](upload://joriDClZ22ZmCybXHKENoSjXT6n.png) \n\n![the%20reef%20fooding%202%20|589x597](upload://vIG2wtvxsX7uBqWUQHoY4c05Au1.png) \n\n## Living green as a social experiment \n\nShared examples of collective easy going processes of diving into green habits\n* **Living plastic-less: try a 1 month challenge and see how to consume less plastic. Over time it becomes easier.**\n* **Making own food and cooking habits**: fermenting things is the easiest to start (@noemi maybe the Reef will need your tips !)\n * **Waste management: composting, but also reusing water.**\n* **The Reef as launchpad for \u201cproximity workspaces\u201d**: Home offices reduce commuting. But could we make a stance to reduce city mobility by evolving the home office into a proximity office, where people are 5 minutes away from their office. This is also something for those in and around the neighborhood who might not be freelancers, but might be supported by their employers to work remotely (Alberto)\n\n## Strenghten the community agreement\n\nThe idea of The Reef would be that it would be a fluid space for experimentation, where you can make mistakes and learn from them (anyone\u2019s mistakes!).\n\nThe Reef already exists in its first small version since 3 years ago: social interactions, housing, zero waste habits...all the seeds are already here in Brussels and led by the Edgeryders community \n\n![the%20reef%20today%20|690x443](upload://hpFTcyZm45vP9Nk6TUbZpuBYWVN.jpeg) ![the%20reef%20today%202|690x453](upload://ykT0JzQQhcfPjkIp7LoOHupiRXP.png) \n\n\nThe bigger Reef which we are co-designing would be:\n\n ***A place for sustainable relationships*** (Gilles)\n***A place for learning*** \n***A place where transmission of knowledge happens, and a place that builds legacy*** (@BaobabUrbain / Isabelle, strongly endorsed by @Ugne)\n\n\nEach commitment needs values to implement collectively on a daily basis. Values that are important to begin with, as emphasized by the group:\n\n* Acceptance, tolerance to difference\n* Diversity: socio-economic, cultural, linguistic (especially highlighted by Manuel and Noemi) - \u2018To put the diversity of the City of Brussels in a house\u2019\n* A prototyping mindset: continuous experimentation \n\n## How can we make buildings more sustainable? Reflections on the \"Autonomous house\"\n\nSpecial Thanks to @matthias @malcolm @ilaria and Vincent <3   \nThis was a hard topic to dive into. Framing the technical aspect of living green. The discussion was related to building materials, household appliances, the inhabitants\u2019 \u201cbehavior of living\u201d etc\u2026 \n\nMalcolm shared views Influenced by Brent and Robert Vale\u2019s book \u201cThe Autonomous House\u201d, an influential book in the 1970s. They approached a house as an input / output device. An \u201cearthbound spacecraft\u201d that should be self-sufficient. They thought about the flows going in and out: air, water, sewage etc\u2026 And then how to minimize the flows.\n\nThe capital consumption (embodied energy etc.) to build a perfect building has to be considered when thinking if a building is ecological or not. (Comment by Ilaria: That\u2019s the basic idea of circular economy.)\n\nInsulation: Usually you\u2019d first insulate, then heat (as much as still needed). But there are challenges: Adding wall insulation on the outside of existing buildings is a problem. Because it may inhibit windows from working. And if you add insulation on the inside, the thermal mass of the building is of not much use for keeping the room temperature constant.\n\nThe Reef as a vehicle for social inclusion and ecological relationships\n--\n![Matthias%20truck%20%20housing%20and%20ecology%20in%201%20place|690x427](upload://4kUmBM5imD4xuUNo9Xi9tyOUISI.png) \n\n@ilaria\n> Caring for the environment (the culture) is a closed, *bourgeois* *club* these days. It costs energy to choose ecological behavior. It has to open up. Changing behavior only happens when you see the value.\n\nNot everyone has the passion for the environment. People need to see the value for their own lives to engage in ecological behavior. \nNot to mention: with open source tech, ecology becomes affordable *and* accessible to anyone.\n\nIt happens that ecological shift might be refrained by cultural ties such as is rural Italy areas where wood burning is a common way of heating while remaining one of the most polluting. Advocacy was done to call for a change at first in public policy regarding heating system and then in household behaviours. \n\nVincent also pointed out how necessary it is to define to what degree or extremeness you want to be ecological with your building.\n\n> It\u2019s easy to be extreme, in a way. But when it means that the comfort level drops too low, you have to warn people before they join, or visit.\n\nBehavior setting theory is a nice framework for effecting behavior change by incentives in the physical environment. @matthias underlined that it could be well integrated into green buildings, as it deals with the connection between behavior and things that we found to be important for low-resource-use living.\n\nExperiments from [Low-Tech Magazine](https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/). enlightened powers and weaknesses on low tech solutions. \n\nThis 2nd workshop was a momentum on seizing collectively the green approach we'd like to implement in the Reef.

I'm building up the participant database for the Brussels workshop that will be held on the 24th and i wanted to see if anybody else in other cities have issues finding the right people. We have a lot of freelance thinkers and problem solvers, but the people inside the medical and social field are difficult to reach i find.\u00a0\n\nThis is what we already did as a reach out:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\ncontacted between 50 and 70 people directly\n\n30 organizations\n\n3 political parties\n\nposted in 20 groups reaching between 150 and 10 000 people\n\nsend mail to all edgeryders profiles that where at LOTE5\n\nhelped writing 4 stories and\n\nreached out to 4 others in Belgium\n\nMet all those people that wrote a story in Brussels\n\nOn the following link you can see all the people that responded:\u00a0https://metamaps.cc/maps/2175\n\nBut still we only have 17 attendees at the moment that confirmed.\u00a0\n\nWhat could we do differently, how can we reach to the right people.\u00a0\n\nFor me it is molenbeek post attacks all over again: the social cultural field comes together because they don't like that molenbeek is shown as bad on tv, they want to organize something to show the good side of molenbeek. They come together once because the urge is there, but when you start talking about going deeper into the structural problems that occure in between social care organizations there, they don't want to participate anymore. So after the moment of silence they organized once, they all go back to there own part, working hard, but not wanting to question methodology or try something different. Because they are already overwelmed. And so it takes time to get their trust...\n\nHow is it going in other cities?\u00a0\n\nthanks for the heads up.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-09 12:16:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:33.879316", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 348, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62890, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11320, "post_number": 31, "raw": "But they are accessible anyway.

The posts here all took some time to digest and show an exciting level of thought, hopefully we'll find good places where we can contribute.\n\nThe SF genre we create in is Cyberpunk. It seems optimistic because it is in the future (as in there is a future) while still being \"*grounded sci fi*\" or simply \"realistic sci fi.\". This as opposed to \"fantasy sci fi\", a sub-genre distinction. We assume anything in Cyberpunk must include an element of anti-authoritarianism.\n\nTo that extent, in the cyberpunk world we created there is some level of geo-engineering and some drawdown technology deployed at scale plus people must have a degree of cyberization (they are cyborgs) and/or gene manipulation, in vitro and/or horizontal (they are inter-species hybridized) to survive. \n\nAs far as other material, we read as much RGP and TT mini fluff as possible. This mostly includes *Shadowrun*, *Rezolution*, *Interface Zero 2.0*, *Judge Dredd*, *Inquisitor*, *Rogue Trader* and *Necromunda*. We really enjoy the original *Ghost in the Shell* anime & diverse SF films, from *Metropolis* to *Alphaville* to *The Matrix* & more. We \"borrow\" freely for characters and scenarios but mostly use either Savage Worlds or 2 Hour Wargame rules.\n\nAlso, we got involved with 3D image making with DAZ3D and have experimented with limited 3D & 2D animation. This all helps us visualize our world. We finished an original feature length screenplay with good Hollywood structure. The movie is about reputation, integrity, identity, dignity, camaraderie and honor being more important to transactions than money.\n\nThe screenplay made it through some early rounds of competitions but never made it to any finals. We intend to rewrite it with fewer characters and a more developed world. We know we have acceptable movie narrative structure down.\n\nFor an in-world economy we've been excited to find this topic here on Edgeryders. Synchronically, Jason Hickel recently published *The sustainable development index: Measuring the ecological efficiency of human development in the anthropocene* (free PDF download available.)\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919303386\nThis seems to hold a great deal of promise. His report opens with a great critique of current state of the art economics and the whole thing is only 8.5 pages (+references). We were hoping someone here might give it a read and offer an opinion.\n\nWe're considering going beyond just creating a RPG economic add-on module to integrating the economics as the scoring system, replacing the current money system used in Savage Worlds. We imagine a world where values other than money are privileged.\n\nWhile we would like to go forward with a screenplay rewrite, for either live or animation production, we also are considering a book or graphic novel.\n\nWhat form or genre is imagined for the form/structure of this project here on Edgeryders?\n\nSecretly, we wish to promote radical system change with fictional narrative. That is our ulterior motivation. We've always imagined critical theory has been part of SF from it's beginnings and wish to continue this trajectory. The idea of presenting this as fiction seems subversive and we like that.\n\nWe've been functioning as a collaborative couple for a long time and intentionally moved into theatre arts from visual arts explicitly to create in a more fully collaborative environment. We really enjoy collaborating. Our biggest production as theatre co-directors included over 60 creatives; including acting talent & design teams for set, lights, audio, makeup & costumes. One of the best times of our lives.\n\nIt seems much more is happening in Europe than here in the States. We greatly appreciate the European cultural lead. The idea of working through Edgeryders on collaborative production is thrilling.", "created_at": "2019-11-20 08:56:35.704443", "updated_at": "2019-11-20 08:56:35.704443", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 629, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 53.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 1514, 5268], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83959, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14492, "post_number": 1, "raw": "This thread is for listing and requesting Edgeryders forms.\n\nNOTE: \n*If you use the tell.form for event signup, remember to mention in the post/form text that the zoom links will be sent out on the day of the event via email.*\n\n### Inventory\nOnce you generated a form, please add it to the list in this first post (wiki) in the following form:\n\n<hr> \n\n\n### Title/description\n1.

Since BS and MS in Engineering at Stanford, I have had leadership roles in startups, nonprofits, and social enterprises in emergent fields. As a \"Shift Shaper,\" my work focuses on collective wisdom and altering systems of consciousness for positive impact. I worked on decentralization in early 2000s focusing on energy, food, and water and on building local economies. Now my focus is decentralizing knowledge & building collective intelligence with my startup Bridgit. \n\nWe make the entire web into a collaborative research platform.\n\nAs a long-time Internet researcher, I have had no system for making sure the information I find online is readily available when I or someone else needs it. I've dreamed of a system that reveals previous research related to one's focus of attention. Imagine, down every rabbit hole, nuggets of insight and innovation.\n\n[Bridgit](https://bridgit.io) is a crowd-mapped Google Earth for online information. Bridgit users build online knowledge maps of ideas & the relationships between them. Thus providing shared context for collaboration and communication without coordination.\n\nOur mission is to connect all the information in the world into a universal knowledge map that can be accessed through the web or in the future through virtual experience, thus creating the possibility of ubiquitous context. We believe that if we want a democratic future, we must move towards an economy that is based on supporting rather than capturing attention. \n\nOur beachhead is emerging ideas. The problem is many groundbreaking ideas experience an uphill battle which delays their impact for years if not decades.  Our platform enables stakeholders to build knowledge maps & shared context for issues that matter; seeing ideas in context makes them more understandable and actionable. \n\nBridgit enables insight, debate & discovery on every webpage by making the entire web into a collaborative research platform. Our browser overlay enables researchers to control, validate, organize & monetize their data. Advanced tagging enables the #OverWeb, a Trust Layer over the webpage. The #OverWeb is a Secure Social Ecosystem that generates valuable semantic, intent, & sentiment data. We use AI to assist in creating/validating content and neutralizing bad actors. \n\nOur platform supports a new category - Massive Online Research Collaborations - that enable researchers to build knowledge together without coordination as well as Bridgit Apps which enable organizations to expose their information and application functionality wherever relevant on the web.\n\nCheck us out at https://bridgit.io!", "created_at": "2019-12-02 18:21:22.806514", "updated_at": "2020-12-10 18:50:32.017333", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 405, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 140.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4934, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17112, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6388, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>We did (on a small scale)</b>\n\nAnd it worked well.

About months I was on line (every line!) nearly 24h. For example they could understand why we asked for plastic crocs style (I avoided the word \"crocs\" and use the word \"clogs\" because many people thought I'm trying to advertise them). Especially for this, a woman from a \"...welcome\" team laught at me and insult me in public. She told me that these type is useless when crossing the european rivers and she refused to share the posts if i didn't ask for rain boots or athletic shoes. I wasted (or maybe not) about an hour to explain that this type of shoes are chosen because: it's easy to use them when you want to go to the bathroom at night, to wash your feet, to rest for a while when you have only one pair of shoes for walking, the are light weight, you can hang them out of the backpack, they are cheap e.t.c.

I personally would create a code `'Polishness'` (using the single quotes to denote an informant concept, see the wiki) and then co-code with the other concept labels that appear (so, `provincial` or `religious` ). Then you\u2019ll end up with a nice co-occurrence network of all the concepts that your informants associate with `'Polishness'`\n[/quote]\nIn the backend, yes. But how would you present it in the codebook? These codes are not really members or examples of Polishness (these words have much broader meaning, obviously).

This form is a tool to help you register and make the most of your participation. \n\nThese events are free of charge.

A key challenge here is for people with aligned interests to find each other, and as a community we\u2019re out to solve just that.

[This link lists 11 of them](https://mediablog.prnewswire.com/2018/01/17/non-profit-investigative-news-sites/).  Mainly they engage in more investigative pieces.\n\nNews is a tough business and it has always needed support from other aspects of its producer.  newspapers relied on classified, horoscopes, columnists, sports and all kind of other items to support their core newsroom.  Classified being the main one. For example, in the last year that I ran sfgate.com in 2001, the newspapers I worked for (there were 2 bound by what they called a \"joint operating agreement\" which in itself was designed to slow down the revenue drain that was already happening in the 60s) grossed 139 million dollars from classified advertising. The building had almost an entire floor of people who just took phone calls all day long for the ads. \n Today they don't even have a meaningful classified section at all.  139 million bucks is a ton of money to simply lose altogether!\n\nIn TV news, many don't know this, but in the early days, TV stations didn't want to carry news at all because it was not profitable to do it.  But the federal government forced them as a condition of using the public airwaves.  Even today I don't think TV news is particularly profitable. For all the attention it receives from other news outlets that talk about such things, only about 5% of the TV-watching population watches TV news on a regular basis (my estimate based on reading a number of sites talking about the subject).\n\nPeople get news from the internet, especially in younger demographics, but one can get into the weeds pretty quickly as you try to define what \"news\" even is.  In this world of clicking to see things, it is now common for headlines to be more sensational and misleading as to the actual content of the story.  AKA \"clickbait.\"  Seems like newsy blogs are especially this way, but then so are a lot of other more mainstream sites. This leads to other bad habits like 'burying the lede\" intentionally so you have to scroll down to find out the true nugget of the story.\n\nSo, yeah, open source not-for-profit news I believe is essential to a free society.

Mam dwoje dzieci. Jedno z dzieci chodzi do przedszkola, a drugim opiekuje si\u0119 babcia w czasie, gdy pracujemy z m\u0119\u017cem. Kiedy m\u00f3j m\u0105\u017c pracuje w polu, ja zajmuj\u0119 si\u0119 dzie\u0107mi. Zdarza si\u0119, \u017ce ja te\u017c co\u015b tam robi\u0119 i wtedy on si\u0119 nimi zajmuje. To nie jest tak, \u017ce musimy wszystko r\u0119cznie robi\u0107, to jest robione mechanicznie. Korzystamy z dop\u0142at dla rolnik\u00f3w z Agencji Restrukturyzacji i Modernizacji Rolnictwa. Nie pokrywaj\u0105 koszt\u00f3w. To co w\u0142o\u017cymy zdarza si\u0119, \u017ce si\u0119 zwr\u00f3ci. Ziemi\u0119 dostali\u015bmy w spadku. Nie mo\u017cemy tego sprzeda\u0107, bo jest pod hipotek\u0105 domu. Z tego te\u017c s\u0105 pieni\u0105dze. Wszystko co wyhodujemy oddajemy na sprzeda\u017c. Mamy dom na kredyt. M\u0105\u017c op\u0142aca kredyt i rachunki, ja op\u0142acam dzieci. Nie mamy wsp\u00f3lnego konta, wi\u0119c nie wiem ile on dok\u0142adnie zarabia. Nie mamy rozdzielno\u015bci maj\u0105tkowej, ale w praktyce funkcjonujemy finansowo osobno. On ma swoje pieni\u0105dze, a ja swoje. Nie jest te\u017c tak, \u017ce przychody z ziemi s\u0105 tylko m\u0119\u017ca. Wydajemy je na wsp\u00f3lne potrzeby. Moje przychody s\u0105 z ksi\u0119gowo\u015bci i ze sta\u017cy. Korzystamy z 500 plus. To co zarabiam nie wystarcza na utrzymanie. Pracuj\u0119, bo nigdy nie by\u0142am i nie chc\u0119 by\u0107 zale\u017cna od m\u0119\u017ca finansowo. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce na d\u0142u\u017csz\u0105 met\u0119 nie wytrzyma\u0142abym w domu, siedz\u0105c i opiekuj\u0105c si\u0119 tylko dzie\u0107mi, dbaj\u0105c o dom. Mia\u0142am dwa razy przerw\u0119 w pracy: po urodzeniu syna dwa lata i p\u00f3\u0142 roku po urodzeniu c\u00f3rki. Po roku w domu by\u0142o mi ci\u0119\u017cko. Chcia\u0142am ju\u017c p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107 do pracy. W przypadku c\u00f3rki uwa\u017cam, \u017ce \u017ale zrobi\u0142am, bo mia\u0142a tylko p\u00f3\u0142 roku jak posz\u0142am do pracy. Widzia\u0142am na pocz\u0105tku, \u017ce jej mnie brakuje, ale zale\u017ca\u0142o mi wtedy na tym, \u017ceby pracowa\u0107 tu, gdzie pracuj\u0119. Te\u015bciowie i rodzice s\u0105 dla nas wsparciem w opiece nad dzie\u0107mi. M\u0105\u017c w 2009 roku zacz\u0105\u0142 dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 gospodarcz\u0105 \u2013 us\u0142ugi transportowe. Polega\u0142o to na tym, \u017ce wyje\u017cd\u017ca\u0142 w Polsk\u0119. Mieli\u015bmy du\u017cego busa, on \u0142adowa\u0142 go, a ja szuka\u0142am r\u00f3\u017cnych towar\u00f3w do przewiezienia po ca\u0142ej Polsce, i rozwozi\u0142 je. W 2012 roku m\u0105\u017c podpisa\u0142 umow\u0119 na prowadzenie kiosku. Potem dobrali\u015bmy drugi. W kioskach pracowali nasi rodzice na zmian\u0119. To s\u0105 dla nich pieni\u0105dze. My z tego odk\u0142adamy dla siebie tylko na zap\u0142acenie podatk\u00f3w. Teraz m\u0105\u017c zamyka dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107, bo musi zacz\u0105\u0107 p\u0142aci\u0107 du\u017cy ZUS. Wcze\u015bniej robili\u015bmy wszystko, \u017ceby nie musia\u0142 go p\u0142aci\u0107. Mia\u0142 r\u00f3\u017cne umowy, w tym za granic\u0105. Dopiero od lutego tego roku musi p\u0142aci\u0107 du\u017cy ZUS, dlatego zamyka dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 i skorzystamy z okazji, \u017ce mo\u017cemy otworzy\u0107 now\u0105 na emeryta ( *przyp. formalnie na inn\u0105 osob\u0119 z rodziny, b\u0119d\u0105c\u0105 na emeryturze* ). Dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 nie jest nieop\u0142acalna, ale je\u017celi do\u0142o\u017cymy wydatki, jakie nam si\u0119 teraz skumulowa\u0142y, czyli awari\u0119 dw\u00f3ch samochod\u00f3w, to ju\u017c jest \u017ale. Jestem ubezpieczona w Kasie Rolniczego Ubezpieczenia Spo\u0142ecznego ( *dalej: KRUS* ), ale w tej chwili nie, bo jestem w trakcie sta\u017cu. M\u0105\u017c z racji prowadzonej dzia\u0142alno\u015bci nie mo\u017ce by\u0107 na KRUSie. Nie mo\u017ce dlatego, \u017ce kiedy\u015b by\u0142y takie przepisy, \u017ce trzeba by\u0142o p\u0142aci\u0107 sk\u0142adki do KRUS przez 3 lata, zanim za\u0142o\u017cy si\u0119 dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 gospodarcz\u0105. My dostali\u015bmy ziemi\u0119 po jej za\u0142o\u017ceniu. Musz\u0119 by\u0107 w KRUS, bo nie mam pracy, a m\u0105\u017c ma ziemi\u0119. Wtedy nie mog\u0119 te\u017c si\u0119 zarejestrowa\u0107 w urz\u0119dzie pracy. Musz\u0119 p\u0142aci\u0107 KRUS, bo wed\u0142ug pa\u0144stwa ja mog\u0119 si\u0119 z tej ziemi utrzyma\u0107. Formalnie nigdy nie trac\u0119 \u017ar\u00f3d\u0142a dochodu. P\u0142ac\u0119 do KRUS nieca\u0142e 400 z\u0142 na kwarta\u0142. Gdy ma si\u0119 dziecko do 5 lat, p\u0142aci si\u0119 niewiele ponad 100 z\u0142. Ka\u017cda umowa o prac\u0119 i ka\u017cde zlecenie powy\u017cej minimalnej krajowej ( *przyp. 2 250 z\u0142* ) wy\u0142\u0105cza\u0142aby mnie z KRUS. Dostarczam umow\u0119 do KRUS, a jak tylko ona wyga\u015bnie, znowu musz\u0119 p\u0142aci\u0107 tam sk\u0142adki. Ubezpieczenie rolnika w KRUS dzia\u0142a tak samo jak ubezpieczenie w Zak\u0142adzie Ubezpiecze\u0144 Spo\u0142ecznych ( *dalej: ZUS* ), np.: mog\u0119 i\u015b\u0107 do lekarza na tych samych zasadach, mog\u0119 i\u015b\u0107 na zwolnienie, ale zasi\u0142ek dla pracownika na zwolnieniu powy\u017cej 33 dni wynosi 9 z\u0142 za dzie\u0144. Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce w zarzutach dotycz\u0105cych istnienia KRUS, chodzi o to, \u017ce z dzia\u0142alno\u015bci ludzie p\u0142ac\u0105 podatki i przy umowach o prac\u0119 p\u0142ac\u0105 du\u017co sk\u0142adek, a taki rolnik p\u0142aci sobie 400 z\u0142 raz na kwarta\u0142 i jest zadowolony, bo nie p\u0142aci od tego podatku, je\u017celi zdecyduje si\u0119 uprawa\u0107 tylko ziemi\u0119. W innym przypadku \u2013 pracuj\u0105c na minimaln\u0105 krajow\u0105 albo prowadz\u0105c dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 gospodarcz\u0105 - te\u017c p\u0142aci ZUS. Tylko nie patrzy si\u0119 na to, \u017ce b\u0119d\u0105c w KRUS masz zbiory tylko przez kilka miesi\u0119cy w roku. Nie jest tak, \u017ce masz co miesi\u0105c doch\u00f3d, bo sprzedajesz po tonie pszenicy. Sprzedajesz j\u0105 jednorazowo za jak\u0105\u015b kwot\u0119 i ona wcale nie jest taka du\u017ca, bo tona pszenicy kosztuje chyba 700 z\u0142. To co to jest? Tak jak w naszej sytuacji uprawy owoc\u00f3w \u2013 porzeczk\u0119 sprzedajesz z dnia na dzie\u0144, nie mo\u017cesz jej przechowa\u0107. I nie da si\u0119 tego policzy\u0107, bo kiedy\u015b kilogram porzeczki by\u0142 po 5 z\u0142, a teraz jest po 0,30 z\u0142 za kilogram. To si\u0119 nie op\u0142aca. Mamy podpisany kontrakt chyba do 2022 roku, \u017ce musimy odstawi\u0107 jak\u0105\u015b ilo\u015b\u0107 owoc\u00f3w do skupu. Podpisali\u015bmy go w 2016 roku. Gdyby\u015bmy go rozwi\u0105zali teraz pewnie musieliby\u015bmy odda\u0107 pieni\u0105dze za sadzonki. Po zako\u0144czeniu kontraktu prawdopodobnie zlikwidujemy wszystkie owoce, sprzedamy kombajn do owoc\u00f3w i b\u0119dziemy tylko sia\u0107 zbo\u017ce, bo to si\u0119 kosi jednorazowo w roku. Zbo\u017ce nie wymaga tyle czasu, co porzeczki. Uwa\u017cam, ze uprawa ziemi wr\u0119cz wp\u0142ywa na start\u0119 w naszym bud\u017cecie domowym. Wydali\u015bmy bardzo du\u017co na opryski i na nawozy, a to co sprzedali\u015bmy i zosta\u0142o na krzaku tego nie wyr\u00f3wna\u0142o w \u017caden spos\u00f3b. W tamtym roku porzeczki da\u0142y nam tyle, \u017ce mieli\u015bmy 10 tys. z\u0142 na wakacje. I tylko to. Naszym g\u0142\u00f3wnym \u017ar\u00f3d\u0142em utrzymania jest praca na etacie i dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 gospodarcza. Je\u015bli rolnictwo padnie, nic si\u0119 u nas za bardzo nie stanie. M\u0105\u017c zarabia trzy razy tyle co ja. Je\u017celi odejmie si\u0119 od tego podatek, rachunki, kredyt i np.: samochody, kt\u00f3re w tym miesi\u0105cu kosztowa\u0142y nas ok. 7 000 z\u0142, jest na stracie. Ja ze swojej wyp\u0142aty \u017cyj\u0119 od pierwszego do pierwszego, nie wiem ile zostaje m\u0119\u017cowi. Mam jakie\u015b zask\u00f3rniaki na koncie oszcz\u0119dno\u015bciowym, kt\u00f3re wybieram jak s\u0105 potrzebne. Zazwyczaj ja robi\u0119 zakupy do domu, wi\u0119ksze koszty ponosi m\u0105\u017c. Ale przy dw\u00f3jce dzieci du\u017co tego idzie na jedzenie, ubrania, przedszkole, dodatkowe zaj\u0119cia. Op\u0142acam to ja. Meble bierzemy na kredyt. W tej chwili mamy trzy kredyty. W normalnym dniu roboczym wraca do domu po 14, jemy obiad i chwil\u0119 bawimy si\u0119 z dzie\u0107mi. Po czym m\u0105\u017c wychodzi ok. 19:00, bo wtedy mo\u017cna pryska\u0107 i wraca ok. 2:00 w nocy. Wyje\u017cd\u017ca nast\u0119pnego dnia rano, zawozi syna do przedszkola, wraca r\u00f3\u017cnie: po 17:00, po 14:00, jednego dnia nie pracuje. U niego praca jest zr\u00f3\u017cnicowana czasowo, ja staram si\u0119 by\u0107 po 14 codziennie. Pracuj\u0119 zdalnie w domu, ale teraz niewiele. Wi\u0119cej czasu zajmowa\u0142o mi to do kwietnia. To jest m\u0119cz\u0105ce, bo dzieci jest dwoje i ca\u0142y czas kto\u015b co\u015b chce. Teraz sp\u0119dzamy z m\u0119\u017cem czas z dzie\u0107mi po r\u00f3wno. Ten uk\u0142ad jest dla mnie komfortowy. Mam czas wolny godzin\u0119 jak je\u017cd\u017c\u0119 na rolkach i jak je\u017cd\u017c\u0119 rowerem do pracy. Czasem gdzie\u015b wyjdziemy wieczorem ze znajomymi i wtedy mo\u017cemy wzi\u0105\u0107 dzieci.\n\nGdyby nie 500 plus robi\u0142oby to r\u00f3\u017cnic\u0119 w moim bud\u017cecie. Swoje 500 plus oddaj\u0119 te\u015bciowej za opiek\u0119 na dzie\u0107mi. 500 plus to jest po\u0142owa mojego jednego kredytu. Je\u017celi ludzie m\u00f3wi\u0105, \u017ce podnosz\u0105 im podatki, a oni nie dostaj\u0105 500 plus... Z tego co widz\u0119 \u017ale m\u00f3wi\u0105 o tym osoby, kt\u00f3re maj\u0105 jedno dziecko albo nie maj\u0105 go wcale. Rozumiem to. Ale mi te pieni\u0105dze s\u0105 potrzebne i nie wydaj\u0119 ich na byle co. Inni niech sobie robi\u0105 z tymi pieni\u0119dzmi co chc\u0105, ja je wydaj\u0119 na dzieci. C\u00f3rka musia\u0142aby by\u0107 teraz w \u017c\u0142obku albo ja nie pracowa\u0142abym, bo chorowa\u0142aby, a tak oddaj\u0119 kas\u0119 te\u015bciowej, kt\u00f3ra z ni\u0105 siedzi. Skoro ja dostaj\u0119 500 plus, to inni te\u017c. Maj\u0105 dwoje dzieci, wi\u0119c te\u017c im si\u0119 nale\u017cy. Czy to jest osoba biedna czy to osoba bogata. Odk\u0105d urodzi\u0142y si\u0119 moje dzieci, pierwsz\u0105 korzy\u015b\u0107 mia\u0142am za czas\u00f3w PO ( *przyp. Platforma Obywatelska* ), czyli wyd\u0142u\u017cenie urlopu rodzicielskiego p\u0142atnego o rok. 500 plus te\u017c jest dla mnie pomoc\u0105. Z drugiej strony widz\u0119, \u017ce s\u0105 zmiany dla przedsi\u0119biorc\u00f3w, kt\u00f3re maj\u0105 uszczelni\u0107 VAT. JPK ( *przyp. Jednolity Plik Kontrolny* ) na pewno utrudni\u0142o nam dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107. Teraz jest ci\u0119\u017cej o dodatkowe faktury. Zdarza si\u0119, \u017ce kupujemy faktury, \u017ceby obni\u017cy\u0107 sobie VAT. Teraz zap\u0142acili\u015bmy 300 z\u0142 za faktury na ok. 2 000 z\u0142. Zazwyczaj oddaje si\u0119 50% VAT. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce ci\u0119\u017cko im b\u0119dzie ca\u0142kiem wyzby\u0107 si\u0119 tego kr\u0119tactwa, ale ju\u017c jest jakie\u015b ograniczenie. To jest dobra zmiana. Jako \u017cona przedsi\u0119biorcy nie chc\u0119 p\u0142aci\u0107 VAT, ale p\u0142ac\u0119 go, chocia\u017c czasem nie mam sk\u0105d na niego wzi\u0105\u0107.\n\nNie obj\u0119\u0142a mnie reforma edukacji, bo mam za ma\u0142e dzieci. Nie zastanawia\u0142am si\u0119 nad tym. Zastanawiali\u015bmy si\u0119 bardziej nad tym czy wybra\u0107 przedszkole prywatne czy pa\u0144stwowe. Teraz ju\u017c wiemy, \u017ce pa\u0144stwowe. M\u0119\u017ca dzieci chodz\u0105 do prywatnego przedszkola. S\u0105 bardzo inteligentne, ale zastanawiamy si\u0119 czy nie s\u0105 troch\u0119 wycofane spo\u0142ecznie. Nie wiedz\u0105 co to jest \u017cycie. Kto\u015b je mo\u017ce uderzy\u0107, poci\u0105gn\u0105\u0107 za warkocz itp. M\u00f3j syn ma kontakt z r\u00f3\u017cnym \u015brodowiskiem, nie tylko idealnym. S\u0105 dzieci biedne, s\u0105 dzieci bogate, bez rodzic\u00f3w i z rodzicami. Nie uwa\u017cam, \u017ce po\u015bwi\u0119caj\u0105 mu w przedszkolu za ma\u0142o uwagi. Syn musi wiedzie\u0107, \u017ce nie jest p\u0119pkiem \u015bwiata, nie jest sam i nikt nie b\u0119dzie nad nim stercza\u0142. P\u00f3jdzie do szko\u0142y, tam b\u0119dzie mia\u0142 ok. 30 dzieci i musi zd\u0105\u017cy\u0107 si\u0119 nauczy\u0107.\n\nZ dzie\u0107mi korzystamy z prywatnej opieki zdrowotnej, bo pa\u0144stwowa jest beznadziejna. Wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce w pa\u0144stwowej lekarze podchodz\u0105 do tego do\u015b\u0107 oboj\u0119tnie. Syn kiedy\u015b du\u017co chorowa\u0142. Chodzili\u015bmy leczy\u0107 go pa\u0144stwowo i ci\u0105gle by\u0142y jeszcze jakie\u015b syropy, a jak poszli\u015bmy prywatnie, dosta\u0142 antybiotyk. Ja nie jestem za leczeniem dzieci czosnkiem i syropem z cebuli. Je\u015bli widz\u0119, \u017ce co\u015b jest nie tak, jak najbardziej jestem za antybiotykiem. Sama korzysta\u0142am z rehabilitacji pa\u0144stwowo tylko dlatego, \u017ce kolega tam przyjmowa\u0142. Po drugim zabiegu te\u017c by\u0142am pa\u0144stwowo po znajomo\u015bci, bo kolega by\u0142 tam rehabilitantem. Najpierw przyje\u017cd\u017ca\u0142 do mnie do domu, za co p\u0142aci\u0142am, a potem za\u0142atwi\u0142 mi bezp\u0142atnie u siebie. Z ulicy na rehabilitacj\u0119 czeka si\u0119 oko\u0142o trzech miesi\u0119cy. Kolejny zabieg mia\u0142am przy\u015bpieszony. Chodzi\u0142am pocz\u0105tkowo prywatnie do gabinetu. To by\u0142a rodzina mojej te\u015bciowej. I dlatego pa\u0144stwowo zoperowali mnie szybko. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce powinni to zmieni\u0107, \u017ce idziesz do specjalisty i czekasz do niego rok. Jestem pod kontrol\u0105 okulisty. Zapisywa\u0142am si\u0119 w marcu i zosta\u0142am zapisana na 3 wrze\u015bnia. Na rezonans magnetyczny czeka\u0142am rok. Po czym okaza\u0142o si\u0119, \u017ce jestem w ci\u0105\u017cy i nie mog\u0142am go wykona\u0107. Wtedy na rehabilitacj\u0119 bez znajomo\u015bci te\u017c czeka\u0142am rok i nie mog\u0142am z niej skorzysta\u0107. Nie prze\u0142o\u017cysz tego, po prostu termin przepada. Nikt z tego nie skorzysta\u0142. Przetrzyma\u0142am kolejk\u0119.\n\nNie g\u0142osowa\u0142am w ostatnich wyborach. Nie mam preferencji politycznych. Ogl\u0105dam wiadomo\u015bci, ale nie zag\u0142\u0119biam si\u0119 w polityk\u0119. Jedyne co wiem, to \u017ce nie odpowiada mi Kukiz. Rzadko g\u0142osuj\u0119. Miejsce g\u0142osowania mam w innym mie\u015bcie ni\u017c mieszkam, bo nie jestem tu zameldowana. PIS jest jaki jest, ale mi z nim \u017ale nie jest. Bardziej przygl\u0105da\u0142am si\u0119 na afery: pods\u0142uchowe, afery z grami hazardowymi. Teraz te\u017c by\u0142y przypadki, \u017ce nagle u premier Szyd\u0142o zgin\u0119\u0142a ca\u0142a dokumentacja w prokuraturze. Jest r\u00f3\u017cnie, ale jak by\u0142o PO, nic z tego nie mia\u0142am, a teraz mam. Pod wzgl\u0119dem podatk\u00f3w, po uszczelnieniu VATu, wi\u0119cej p\u0142ac\u0119. Z drugiej strony mo\u017ce na co\u015b ta kasa p\u00f3jdzie. Mo\u017ce na moje 500 plus. Nie wnikam w cudze problemy, bardziej interesuje mnie moja sytuacja.\n\nNie chodz\u0119 do ko\u015bcio\u0142a, ale jestem osob\u0105 wierz\u0105c\u0105. Nie chodz\u0119, bo nigdy nie jest mi po drodze. Zazwyczaj niedziel\u0119 sp\u0119dzam w domu z dzie\u0107mi i c\u00f3rka wtedy \u015bpi. Je\u015bli wesela s\u0105 o 15, to te\u017c rzadko zd\u0105\u017c\u0119, bo to czas spania dziecka. Ale moje dzieci znaj\u0105 i odmawiaj\u0105 pacie\u017c. Przyjmuj\u0119 ksi\u0119dza w domu. Irytuj\u0105 mnie ksi\u0119\u017ca i to jak przychodzi po kol\u0119dzie i ma swoje komentarze. Raz mi si\u0119 zdarzy\u0142o, \u017ce syn sam by\u0142 u moich rodzic\u00f3w, kiedy przyszed\u0142 ksi\u0105dz i pad\u0142o pytanie: \u201eco to jest za dziecko?\u201d. Nie grzecznie: czyje to dziecko, tylko takim tonem... wrzutem. Rok temu jak u nas by\u0142 ksi\u0105dz... Niestety nie ma u nas jeszcze kostki. Ksi\u0105dz w takich ub\u0142oconych butach wparowa\u0142 nam na dywan do salonu i: \u201ejak wy tu chodzicie, \u017ce nie macie chodnika?\u201d Nie ka\u017cdego sta\u0107, \u017ceby zrobi\u0107 200 m kostki. Teraz jest g\u0142o\u015bno o pedofilii w ko\u015bciele. Czy prawnik czy lekarz \u2013 ka\u017cdy mo\u017ce by\u0107 pedofilem. Ka\u017cdy mo\u017ce mie\u0107 odchy\u0142y. Wiadomo, \u017ce tam jest tego wi\u0119cej, bo ksie\u017ca s\u0105 bardziej ograniczeni i mog\u0105 wykorzysta\u0107 dzieci. W \u017caden spos\u00f3b tego nie popieram i gdyby mnie to dotkn\u0119\u0142o, po prostu zabi\u0142abym kogo\u015b takiego. Nie wp\u0142ywa to na moj\u0105 wiar\u0119. Nie wiem czy teraz te\u017c to jest tak zamiatane pod dywan jak kiedy\u015b. Z tego co si\u0119 dowiadywa\u0142am z ksi\u0105\u017cek, za Jana Paw\u0142a II by\u0142o jeszcze gorzej. Uwa\u017cali\u015bmy, \u017ce to chodz\u0105cy idea\u0142, bo to polski papie\u017c, a to guzik prawda. Odb\u0119bniam wszystkie mo\u017cliwe \u015bwi\u0119ta, chocia\u017c ostatnio zastanawia\u0142am si\u0119 nad tym, \u017ce najch\u0119tniej wyjecha\u0142abym wtedy; wesela, chrzciny, bierzmowania r\u00f3wnie\u017c. Nie wiem czy to nie jest bardziej tradycyjnie. Zdarza si\u0119, \u017ce modl\u0119 si\u0119 o zdrowie dzieci, ale zauwa\u017cy\u0142am, \u017ce na drugi dzie\u0144 zazwyczaj kt\u00f3re\u015b jest chore... Mama wychowywa\u0142a mnie w wierze, ojciec nie. Zazwyczaj jak je\u017adzi\u0142am w niedziel\u0119 do dziadk\u00f3w, musia\u0142am by\u0107 w ko\u015bciele. Teraz bardzo ma\u0142o m\u0142odych os\u00f3b chodzi do ko\u015bcio\u0142a. To negatywne zjawisko, bo odsuwamy si\u0119 od ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Uwa\u017cam, \u017ce ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 ma za du\u017cy wp\u0142ywa na pa\u0144stwo, tak jak np.: Rydzyk itd. Jestem zwolenniczk\u0105 wsp\u00f3\u0142pracy ko\u015bcio\u0142a z pa\u0144stwem, ale nie na a\u017c takim poziomie. Nie przeszkadza mi religia w szko\u0142ach i krzy\u017ce, bo sk\u0105d\u015b dzieci musz\u0105 si\u0119 tego uczy\u0107. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce zwi\u0105zki wyznaniowe w Polsce powinny mie\u0107 r\u00f3wn\u0105 pozycj\u0119, ale nie wiem czy Polska jest na to przygotowana. Jeste\u015bmy rasistami. Mi \u017bydzi nie przeszkadzaj\u0105, ale zak\u0142adam, \u017ce \u017byd z pejsami po mie\u015bcie \u0142atwo nie przejdzie. Sama na marsz r\u00f3wno\u015bci nie posz\u0142abym, ale ze wzgl\u0119du na bezpiecze\u0144stwo. Nie przeszkadzaj\u0105 mi osoby homoseksualne, ale nie znam \u017cadnego geja ani lesbijki. Ci\u0119\u017cko mi powiedzie\u0107, ale adopcja dzieci mnie wycofuje. Ja jestem tradycyjnioe wychowana. Dla mnie to nie jest model rodziny, jaki by\u0107 powinien. Wiem, \u017ce si\u0119 nie godz\u0105 na marsze, ale nie interesuj\u0119 si\u0119 polityk\u0105 lokaln\u0105.", "created_at": "2019-08-09 06:53:41.382118", "updated_at": "2019-08-09 06:53:41.382118", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2311, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 37.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57420, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10442, "post_number": 2, "raw": "\nBelow is a google translation of the final copy for our wellbeing landing page.

I avoid them, regardless of whether I am looking for work, or have work that I am looking for someone to do.\n\nThe last time I was in a formal process of this kind was in 2010 when a recruiter got in touch with me on behalf of a tech multinational. I should have dropped out of the process when the person asked me for a CV in spite of having found me on Linkedin. But at the time I was so ready to leave the job and sector I was in and it felt like a gift from the universe so I played along. I was very careful to point out that I am not a programmer as this company is known for being developer run and that I have a pretty odd professional profile (including having worked as a cook on a Viking Ship). They asked me to submit a portfolio as well do a creative test developing a concept based on a scenario all the way down to designing the interfaces (the say sketch and don't spend more than 3 hrs but knowing designers...). \n\nThe material was supposedly for people to look at, who would then decide on that basis whether I would move on to the next round which was a series of phone interviews. When I did do the phone interviews with those people it was clear they hadn't even looked at the material. I was asked questions to gauge my proficiency in a number of areas and was straightforward about not being interested in them. After almost six months of this I was flown over to another country for face to face interviews with loads of people. I asked the recruiter if we could do video-conferencing instead and she said no, can't remember what the reason was. On arrival it was pretty clear to me that this was not somewhere I wanted to work, it felt like Dilbertspace...cubicles etc. and I lost interest in the whole thing. Especially after having an honest conversation with one of the employees; it turns out alot of the information I had been told about the role, dynamics and corporate culture was to put it charitably, fluff. \n\nThere were rounds and round of interviews and meetings with loads of people, including a whole day of awkward sessions where up to more than four people would be asking me all kinds of questions that gave the impression that the work was a lot more interesting that it really is. And when I feigned lack of knowledge to test their claims that it was \"potential\", and not specialised tech skills they were looking for- they flunked. In the end what came out of it was that I met some nice people, with some of whom I have stayed in touch. However, it is likely I would have met them anyway as our paths have crossed for other reasons. So the whole thing was a massive waste of everyone's time. \n\nThe last time I looked for people to do some work I thought about posting an ad on one of the job sites. I started writing the description and quickly realised that what I was looking for was someone intelligent, who could figure stuff out and get the job done (i.e. deliver results) without much hand-holding. And that formal qualifications would tell me very little about how the candidates would perform. So I took the easy way out and just asked my social network to recommend someone. It worked out really well, smooth sailing. But I do recognise a number of shortcomings with this way of doing things, the main one being that you miss an opportunity to be surprised by lot of the talent you didn't know you needed! Plus working with new people is an opportunity to learn new kinds of things and meet interesting people that can enrich your experience of being in the world. \n\nToday I came across <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market\">an article in which the author explores the difficulties of matching work and talent or skills</a>. The article itself I think is less interesting than\u00a0 the discussions in the comments from both recruiters, hiring managers and people who are or have been looking for employment.\u00a0 I wonder if there are any points in there that you think are worth highlighting or exploring further in the context of figuring out how to get better matching between work and diverse talents ?\n\nSome points I see in popping up in the discussion highlighted by the quotes:\n\n1.\u00a0 Automated matching:\n\n<blockquote>\" <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470394513\">Last year (or the year before?) the employment system spent $1.3B on </a><a href=\"http://monster.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monster.com</a><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470394513\"> alone. Until employers stop pretending that algorithms find talent, talent will appear to be in short supply. Meanwhile, a small handful of very smart companies are hiring great workers at a discount. </a>\"\n\n</blockquote><blockquote>\n\n\"<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470807121\">I've come to understand is that finding a job through database matches is a complete waste of time. You have better chances winning the lottery than popping up as a good match in an HR database query. Using automated tools to sort through the data may sound like a good idea, but, unless the recruiters are also exceptionally talented, it will just provide an excuse for poor hiring decisions to mediocre medium-level staff who try to not hire others for a living. It is, after all, much safer to claim that you could not find anyone to fill a position, rather than take a decision which may at some point in the future come to haunt you.</a>\"\n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470924602\"> </a>\" <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470924602\">Lchanio: You raise a very important point. \"Poor automated matches, combined with a rigorous selection process\" ...\u00a0\u00a0is what everyone is hiding behind. HR knows the matches are poor, but emphasizes the \"rigorous\" process they use to scour the databases. They debate which databases are the best. But they fail to get their butts up from the chair behind the pc screen to actually go out and recruit. (Remember recruiting? I once did an entire workshop for an association of HR recruiters titled, \"Recruit Is A Verb.\"). </a>\n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470924602\">The rigor of \"the process\" hides the total failure of the process. Older professionals face a double whammy. It's easy to discriminate out of ignorance when you can blame the lack of a match on the database. No need to interview anyone and make a judgment.</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470924602\"> </a><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470924602\">I don't like to sound like a total cynic, but the recruiting and hiring process is overwhelmingly corrupted. When you're spending billions of HR dollars on just one job board, it's already too late. Your infrastructure has been swallowed whole. There is no way out.</a> \"\n\n</blockquote>\u00a0\n\n2. People hiring focusing on potential vs. exactly matching experience:\n\n<blockquote>\u00a0 \" <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-470405968\">This is the first time that I have looked for a job in 34 years. Now there is a \"Berlin Wall\" of HR that must be satisfied before an applicant gets exposed to the person they will be working for. In order to be thorough, HR looks for someone who has actually performed the exact task that the company needs filled.\u00a0 They also make sure that the applicants education is exactly what the position requires. IMHO, we don't hire people based on their potential.</a> \"\n\n</blockquote><blockquote>\" <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/whats_making_this_labor_market.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-whats_making_this_labor_market#comment-471107927\">In fact, any time a technical skill is required for a job I'm willing to bet hr will forward all resumes that have some of the keywords in it. When I have an open position hr sends me every resume they get it seems. I'm the one turning down the ones I don't like. I'm more inclined to believe hiring managers are to blame. They need to be willing to think creatively about candidate potential. If there's an exact fit for a job, you're hiring for yesterday's job opening instead of tomorrow's. I want the guy/gal who can take me someplace better, rather than do exactly the same thing he last employee did before they quit.</a> \"\n\n</blockquote>\u00a0\n\n3.

(the foldscopes are tricky for keeping track of where you are, and we only had one proper scope)  Then, in some cases (for instance a woman who had already had cancer and was scared that she might have serious signs of damage) you really don't want to find *any*...  She got to see some of her own cells looking aok, so I was happy too!  It is still a great learning experience, for sure!

My dream is to have biohackers all over getting good baselines for the ordinary levels of damage then do some sort of intervention (running, eating blueberries, drinking green tea) to see if there is some significant effect.  Ex situ expts are also possible on the cheek cells (gentle collection with a toothbrush provides a lot of cells to work with) - for the comet assay just putting hydrogen peroxide is a very good positive control (but that protocol is still very far from being simple, especially when you try for 'kitchen sink' ingredients).\nThank you for your enthusiastic message!", "created_at": "2018-02-07 21:44:13.159655", "updated_at": "2018-02-07 21:44:13.159655", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 329, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 139.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4260, 4034, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85620, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14491, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Yes, Chiara, we agree.", "created_at": "2020-10-23 08:02:19.439703", "updated_at": "2020-10-23 08:02:19.439703", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85617], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68192, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 10552, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-01-05 14:36:52.966386", "updated_at": "2020-01-05 14:36:52.966386", "deleted_at": "2020-01-05 14:36:55.304493", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49902, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 9009, "post_number": 25, "raw": "Good find, I don\u2019t love it.

Candidates for the connector are finally here! It was a long and strangely difficult process, but it's kind of normal - takes a while to explain edgeryders and then make people trust this is an actual job. Not to mention these are all busy, smart, young people. But it worked! I managed to get us a fantastic list of people from Poland, have a look at their stories and profiles, and talk with them :) \n\n    * [Kasia](https://edgeryders.eu/t/lokalny-lacznik/10079) - very experienced sociologist from the top science institute in Poland, her story will be there during the weekend\n\n    * [Magda](https://edgeryders.eu/t/czesc-jestem-aktywistka-z-lublina/10047/2), an activist doing a LOT of grassroot work with communities in Poland, and an old friend\n\n    * [Asia](https://edgeryders.eu/t/diagnoza-wsparcie-psychologiczne-i-zycie-z-choroba-przewlekla-w-polsce/10046), feminist activist and a hyper-energetic person, also a long friend of mine - her [second story](https://edgeryders.eu/t/prowadzenie-jednoosobowej-dzialalnosci-gospodarczej-w-polsce/10049) is already here as well \n\n    * and [Miko\u0142aj](https://edgeryders.eu/t/budujmy-wspolnoty/10052), a guy I don't know personally and who found me via the advertisement I posted (like Kasia) and who really seems to dig the platform. \n\n    They're all great. I am waiting for three of them to add their stories from other people and we can pick someone soon. \n\n    I am spending a lot of time guiding applicants through the process, the platform and explaining the research (there were many more asking, and they still might apply by the 15th of June) - so it's a lot of calls and emails so far. But it's getting very promising results and now I have 4 people I think I would be super happy to work with. \n\n    Even more, I also have a candidate for Serbia - she didn't introduce herself yet, but she already arranged [the first story](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-new-moral-code-of-21st-century/10030/6). I have one more in my pocket and she will join this/next week. \n\n2. The 6 interviews I did in Poland are in progress - they will be on the platform by mid-June, with 6 brand new, very cool users (I talked with a lady from a working family in her 40ties who has two sick family members and faces losing her home, and votes and works for SLD for years now - a very interesting angle on populism on the different side of the spectrum).\n\n    The 14 others will be coming in the next weeks, I have a very busy friend tasked with them. \n\n3. I prepared the descriptions of the tour and some first draft of the workshop in the fall. I will do the tour alone in the summer (if we approve the texts fast enough, in the dates I mentioned in the draft), probably adding Serbia in August. We will need to find local co-hosts now in these cities (I have some ideas and contacts in the cities I proposed, which is why I selected them). Now we just need to get the social media magic to get many people to see and join them. If you have suggestions on how to improve these texts, let me know. \n\n4. I am planning to do some stories and onboarding at two events at the Warsaw Biennale - it was my idea from the beginning to cooperate with them, as I met the curators in January and they were really open to collaborating with us on the program, but that didn't work out - so we have a chance to join some of the interesting events. \n\n    I got a personal invitation to the [Congress of female farmers](https://biennalewarszawa.pl/konwencja-rolniczek/), happening on the 14th of June, from Poland and abroad. Questions of women's rights and their role in economics, ecology, food security, and identity will be very prominent there - and they're key to our debate on populism. I want to get the international and Polish angle from that meeting. \n\n    And Beyond the Nation-State. Transunions by Jonas Staal. It's a good train trip from Berlin, so I can do both weekends. I would need to have this approved soon to buy tickets before they become too expensive. \n\nOver the next two days, I will continue the onboarding of the candidates and the calls and email conversations with them, tweak the texts and transcribe and approve the next batch of interviews. \n\nWhat needs some help pushing is the call for stories, possibly we should change the deadline again? As we have a social media wizard now, I hope this can get some more traction - @inge, should we maybe change the texts calling for stories and create FB events for that as well?\n\nPS. I'm having personal issues at the moment and they affect my efficiency, for which I apologize, but something very dramatic has happened to me last week and it will take a while to come to terms with it.

I like how all the inspiring young minds are having their thoughts and ideas about more sustainable future with equal access to everyone. For me Open Village Houses concepts are very much practical because it can be an international arena to collaborate and learn with each other. I have studied social work and been involved in many NGO's of my country. Somehow I always wanted to do something which practically helps people, something related to utilizing natural resources and skills, meeting people from around the world and creating an arena where youth can discuss, share and make connections. I have been lucky that my curious mind have lead me to few international conferences where I made good connections with like-minded people and share visions to unleash the potentiality I hold but there are many more whom we together can guide.  Kathmandu is densely populated with students from rural villages, for them getting an opportunity to connect with world or to be supported with resources can be very meaningful. I want to make Open Village House a hub to initiate as well as implement innovative ideas. I see myself believing on those ideas and making them successful or at least try. \n\n**HOW?** \n\"Lack of trust in youth potential\" and \"Lack of resources\" have been great problem. I want to work on SMART vision and relate to more attainable goals.  My goals are very simple,  Co-housing place with sharing kitchen can be great for rural students to get adequate housing facility and enjoy global diversity. (This is very new concept in terms of Nepal).They will have encouraging environment free from stress of landlord or so. They can focus on what they are doing. Co-working space can bring small startups together. It can be IT (Information Technology) students working space. (My brother who is also an IT graduate always wonders if he have some platform where he can casually work with basic facilities to develop app and directly sell apps on market basis like an IT office).  Like @hazem said Open Village can be a local community to solve the local challenges.The co-working space or Our Open House can be open  for all Movers and Shakers.  Coffee roastery will help utilise natural resources and encourage youths to do something in terms of agriculture. \n\nI see many possibilities. One another crazy idea( don't know how much feasible it is) is to help small startup grow on our network. For examples- Online business need spaces to store things, not everyone can have their own space. Our Open Village can help on it by providing certain space for those online business.  I am also thinking to utilise the kitchen more by allowing small companies to use our kitchen for their business. Not for regular operation but for prep and storing like a chocolate/bakery company which don't need regular need of kitchen. They can just prepare a batch according to their sales target and use again according to demand.", "created_at": "2017-09-11 15:05:58.712290", "updated_at": "2017-09-11 15:18:31.187775", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 504, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 155.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [35927], "is_liked_by": [5, 3769, 4196], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56925, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9881, "post_number": 31, "raw": "Noted, @erik_lonroth, and thanks.

If you are developing an app prototype you can use some tools like Marvel to sketch the app screenshots. The idea is not to spend much time and effort to avoid the IKEA effect. When it comes to prototyping less is more and the idea is to not try to create a complete product, so if you are in the wrong path, fail faster to succeed sooner.*\n\n*The technique of design thinking can be used to create prototype especially when you try to improve an existing product or service. Here\u2019s a short video about design thinking: https://youtu.be/_r0VX-aU_T8*\n\n*I received a question from [ **@HIBA** ](https://edgeryders.eu/u/hiba) about the prototype of a service, i.e. a tour/travel service. I answered that since the objective is to test if people are interested in the service, an MVP should be more relevant in that case.*\n\n*An MVP is a way to get a feedback from your customers. You have the choice between a low fidelity MVP and a high fidelity MVP. It depends on the characteristics of your early adopters and the riskiest assumptions that you would like to test.*\n\n*You can opt for various types of MVPs such as a landing page, a video, a concierge MVP, Wizard of Oz MVP, Piece Meal MVP, a single / limited featured MVP etc. In the presentation attached to this post, you can have more details about each MVP type and also examples of companies that have used it in the past.*\n\n*Also, I would advise you to watch this interesting video: https://youtu.be/r4HmIzCmMF8  *\n\n*To answer [ **@HIBA** ](https://edgeryders.eu/u/hiba) \u2018s question, I recommend that she used a landing page. [ **@HIBA** ](https://edgeryders.eu/u/hiba) asked how to do if she has no IT skills and would like to create a landing page. I advised her to use some tools to create websites without having IT knowledge such as WIX, Canvas, Bitrix24, Simplesite etc.*\n\n*We took the example of an online shoe e-commerce app and how to create limited featured MVP. The idea is to create a walking skeleton. You can find more details in the presentation.*\n\n*We had also a very interesting Q&A sessions at the end of the workshop.*\n\n* [ **@ayari.taha** ](https://edgeryders.eu/u/ayari.taha) shared with us his own experience with the video MVP and how it helped him to get insights from potential customers and users.*\n\n*Another question from  [ **@salaheddine** ](https://edgeryders.eu/u/salaheddine) about to whom the MVP should be addressed in the case of multisided app and I answered that he should focus oon the people that will pay for the app, i.e. the business partners.*\n\n*We had also a question from Khadija about the choice of the adequate MVP type and I answered that it should be done taking into account the riskiest assumption. For example, if your riskiest assumption is your revenue stream so you should opt for al landing page and if it\u2019s about the solution itself, other types of MVPs such as the wizard of Oz or single featured MVP can do the trick.*\n\nAs always, a special thank to all the people having attends the lab and I hope that you found it helpful and useful.\n\nBest,\n\nWajdi\n\n [Workshop 1 Presentation.pdf|attachment](upload://up34BgaLgzMYHQy3B3wrSAA7deq.pdf) (3.0 MB)", "created_at": "2020-01-16 10:30:47.285888", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 13:36:06.315991", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 840, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 87.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6078, 3703, 3782, 6132], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35989, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 7020, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Edge Ryders \u0627\u0647\u0644\u0627   \u064a\u0633\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0636\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0646\u0635\u0629 @RAOUD    \n?\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0628\u0627 \u0628\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639\u0646\u0627 ,\u0647\u0644 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u0648\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639\u0643 \u0627\u0643\u062b\u0631  \u0645\u0646 \u0641\u0636\u0644\u0643", "created_at": "2017-09-11 15:35:53.146710", "updated_at": "2017-09-11 15:36:51.270230", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 7.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36702, "user_id": 3613, "topic_id": 7061, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I'm sorry.

Insert: friction between reality and your idea of reality. And it's not just within your smaller community that this is the case, but the whole country feels alien.

But the first time I returned after living abroad for a year, I was shocked with people being upset that the train was a 1 minute late - even though I would've been one of those people a year before that. I was upset that my colleagues at the Dutch Parliament couldn't understand I was giving up my job after a year to move to Ukraine to study a new language. I was annoyed that most of my friends would have time for lunch planned a few months ahead, and would feel uncomfortable if I'd call them to have a drink \"right now.\"\n\nThat was in 2008/2009. And I haven't lived back home since. I just didn't feel home anymore.\n\nBut living abroad you also live in a bubble. And I think that's where the shock of the continued polarization of our worlds lays. It's not that Belgium isn't experiencing its worst rise in extreme right political parties in decades, but you are not affected by it as it \"isn't your country.\" So, you're worried about it, but it hurts more when it's you childhood friend who has fringe ideas about the earth being flat, than when it is your neighbor who you only say hi to.  \n\nI currently live in a country that is extremely homophobic, extremely religious, and extremely patriotic (Georgia) - all the things that I am not (I used to run the joke that my only religion is equality). But its politics and its views \"hurt\" me less than the news that the right wing party in the Netherlands has gained more seats in parliament.

If this design doesn't really fit our needs, we can work with Ola to improve or make additions.\n\nAs for the hosting team, you got yourself a bunch of us coming to Matera in the 26th-27th of October weekend, including Elena Karlsen, Ronen and I, so expect reinforcements :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-01 14:50:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:54.253283", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 286, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68071, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12217, "post_number": 5, "raw": "I dislike hate speech but I think I dislike too many laws and restrictions on speech even more.  If someone wants to out themselves as racist, I say let them show the world for what they truly are.  That does not mean that someone else has an obligation to publish it. That is not the same thing.\n\nBut of course it all gets messier in this world of social media where the illusion is that we have some sort of control over what we see.  Of course we have no such thing.  Not sure about Twitter, but it is well established that Facebook manipulates us all into various polarities so they can make more money off of us.  Their platitudes about free speech and all are just so much bunk.  If they really wanted us to have control we would get meaningful user tools that work with consistency and predictability.  We have neither, and never will under the status quo.  I think Zuckerberg is as bad a liar as Trump.\n\nI remember when more user control was the dominant theme of internet services and I remember when it started to go away, to be replaced by an illusion of control.  I like the better graphics and throughput of today's Net, but in truth I liked the user experience far better in the 90s.  Google and FB has pretty much wrecked it. I will never forgive them for it.\n\nStill, there are places where one can go - this place here being one of them.  We can get a lot of personal and professional satisfaction from using them and other honest sites. But in the larger social context, we're just a blip at this point.  I hope that changes...not giving up hope.\n\nAs for world leaders: I cannot think of a single one I respect right now.  In my almost 69 years, this might be the worst crop of them all.  And right when we need to all pull together to try to stop our collective environmental destruction, which at this point looks like a mathematical certainty.  Now I am sure that some of the smaller countries have good leaders, but I live in the USA.  Until we get rid of the cancer that is Donald Trump and the GOP, this is a wasteland.  And then there is Putin, Brazil, China, India, etc...the big countries all have truly awful leadership.", "created_at": "2020-01-02 20:42:58.583091", "updated_at": "2020-01-02 20:44:48.860371", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 402, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 43.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [67864], "is_liked_by": [5698, 2346], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35990, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 6670, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Looks like a big success for Zyara!

Different from how Discourse is now organized into topics, it would be one location, instead of one person having to set up a topic and then invite everyone. Participants should not get notifications unless someone specifically pings them. Other chat rooms like this public one could also be set up but be made login protected (otherwise people won't really feel chatty, as it's all public again, and like on Twitter you gotta watch out for what you say or you lose your job \u2026).\n\n**Proposed implementation.** I think Discourse is very close to be used like that. We'd set up one single, public topic under Campfire called \"Fireside Chat\" or something, owned by user `edgeryders`  to make it official. Then we need one special line of code that sets the notification level for everyone to \"Normal\" for this topic, right when they sign up to the platform. This  means they only get notifications when they are @mentioned. (Otherwise, after some time in the topic, Discourse would set a user's notification level to \"Following\".) And that chat thread would be linked somewhere prominently, maybe in the horizontal header menu, or even replacing the current \"Campfire\" link on the frontpage.\n\nFinally, to make this use of Discourse even more like a chat we might implement that all messages posted are deleted after, say, four weeks. And also prevent search engine access to this particular chat topic (via a simple `robots.txt` measure at least). Together, that should create an environment where people will feel more free to contribute than in a place  that never forgets anything.\n\n**Suitability of Discourse as a chat solution.** \n\n* you can have multiple topics, to implement multiple chatrooms\n* images, videos etc. can be posted, just like in normal Discourse topics\n* people can freely \"leave\" a chatroom by adjusting their notification settings for the respective topic\n* there are notifications about who else is typing a reply right now, just as in many instant messaging services\n* there are realtime topic updates without requiring reloading the browser page\n* there are desktop notifications (just without sound, but we could try to add that; probably there is a browser extension that allows to do this easily)\n* it's close to Discourse, so we don't make people use yet another platform\n\nOk, a mobile app version is maybe missing. There is a Discourse app, but I don't know what it can do.", "created_at": "2019-09-30 11:25:22.863748", "updated_at": "2019-09-30 18:31:44.532869", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 448, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 23.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 67269, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 12097, "post_number": 2, "raw": "", "created_at": "2019-12-10 16:25:55.554198", "updated_at": "2019-12-10 16:25:55.554198", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 8.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69838, "user_id": 1514, "topic_id": 12581, "post_number": 5, "raw": "As a scholar, Varoufakis should have studied \"virtual\" economies (fake money used in video games).
