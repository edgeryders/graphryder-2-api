In particular, it will become clearer the evaluation criteria issue.\u00a0 That is, given our examples, it will be easier to discuss which kind of analysis will be possible and useful to do. For instance: which kind of conversations are they? Which kind of qualities characterizes them?\n\nTherefore, my proposal is the following:\n\n(1) If possible, Noemi shares with all of us the links with the examples done in the last text.\n\n(2) All of us, in the next 3 days, look at these examples of care-oriented conversations and make some observations, at two levels:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>Considering our sample as a whole</em>, answering questions as: what does this sample represent? How much is it related to the OpenCare specificity? What has been the role of the OpenCare team? \u2026</li>\n\n<li><em>Considering each example</em>, answering questions as: which have these specific conversation motivations\u00a0 been? Which have its results been? In which way is this conversation linked to the OpenCare existence? And, for each conversation main actor, which has his/her values and worldviews been? Did they have these same values and worldviews before to be engaged in OpenCare or did they emerge after that? Which competences and personal resources did they have and utilize? What have their practical commitment and their responsibility been?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n(3) To collect and compare these observations and, on this basis: to discuss the consistency of what we have in our hands and how we could analyze it (in order to \u201cextract\u201d the better from it, considering also what the call-for-papers is asking us).\n\nIn terms of timing, I think we should do (1) and (2) next week (16-20 January), then to draft our observations (3), in the 23-27 January week, and to have a discussion in Rome the 1 or 2 or 3 February. \u00a0\n\nBeyond that, in my view, there is something else to be done:\n\n(A) We should set the basis for a similar analysis and discussion on the infrastructuring activities done by the team. I.e. what the OpenCare team did to create the conditions to make the conversations happen.\n\n(B) to attentively read the call for paper and to discuss how to present our contents in order to fit in the call-for-paper scope. Given that, to discuss the paper interdisciplinary (i.e. the role of different disciplines in it), the main bibliographic references and the language to be used.\n\n<em>Final note: from the 12 February on, until the beginning of March, I will be travelling (and quite busy). Therefore, for me, whatever I would have to do, has to be finished before that date.</em>\n\nLet me know what you think\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-12 15:05:56", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:53.422695", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 569, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33178, "user_id": 3143, "topic_id": 4974, "post_number": 62, "raw": "<b>Can't wait!</b>\n\nHello all,\n\nI'm Alessandro, interaction designer, maker and failed musician.\n\nAs part of the OpenCare team I will be responsible of leading the development of the prototypes offering my tech and design skills.\n\nGuess I will mostly follow the OpenCare activities during LOTE5, but I'm also very curious to know more about the community.\n\nI can't wait to be in Brussels next week and meet you all.\n\nCiao!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-19 12:10:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:02.242160", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 87, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24083, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3178, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Ok I think the second version looks good and ready to share with the rest of the community to ask them if they feel something needs to be added, removed or clarified.

The \u2018City as a resource\u2019 is a proposal to create a network of urban vegetable gardens in the city of Thessaloniki. This project was the outcome of a workshop of the MLA Landscape Architecture School of Architecture of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The concept of the pilot project was to intervene in a residual urban space related to its residents, in a city (municipality) under economic hardship, with no access to infrastructure and funding. After the success of the pilot project which took place in the western part of the city of Thessaloniki (Lachanokipoi district), we decided to cooperate with the Municipality of Thessaloniki and the Department of Urban Environmental Management for the creation of an innovative urban vegetable gardening project in the city center. After mapping all the possible vacant spaces in the city center, the new project finally took place in 2014 at Doxa district, right next to the urban vineyard as a symbolic gesture to the new sustainable lifestyle of the city. The group consists of 10 gardeners, who grow their own vegetables under our supervision and support in a cultivating area of 80 m2 \u00a0(total area 300 m2).The name of the project \u2018Kipos3\u2019 comes from the Greek word \u201ckipos\u201d (garden) which points to the archetypal designed landscape and an aesthetical landscape aspect in the structured urban environment. Our vision is to re-imagine the city through the transformation of abandoned areas, residual spaces within the urban fabric, existing parks in need of renovation and re-design, uncovered terraces and buildings are places that could gain collective use. The city needs its residents. The success of an urban vegetable garden based on collective action depends on its social character and the participatory governance of multi- stakeholders especially the community. Residents cultivate their city!\n\nOur team focuses on enriching original and location-specific ideas with data, information and constant interaction between the local community and the public space. We are connected to many like-minded initiatives all over the world such as the French project \u2018Kipos qui pousse\u2019 and COST Organization for Urban Allotment Gardens in European Cities.\n\nAlthough the whole process meets several obstacles, such as bureaucracy mainly for technical issues, the reservedness of the neighbors due to the fact that they had previous bad experience with municipal actions, we remain focused on our vision, trying to seek collaboration with the municipality, other local authorities and the neighborhood itself.\n\nOur goal for 2017 is to construct a new vegetable garden in the same neighborhood in collaboration with the Municipality of Thessaloniki and create synergies with other like-minded initiatives abroad, learn from experts and adapt best practices grounded in Greek reality. In addition, we are going to preserve precious contacts with artists, architects, and agronomists we have met since the starting points of our project.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Who benefits from Kipos3?</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\tResidents of Thessaloniki getting activated in order to become catalysts of change in their own neighborhood.</li>\n\n<li>\tLocal communities wishing to contribute to social cohesion, participatory governance and upgrading the urban landscape.</li>\n\n<li>\tEveryone who wants to be active and participate in the development and co-formation of vacant public spaces.</li>\n\n<li>\tStudents of all educational levels, who gain environmental education and collective knowledge through field visits.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nKipos3 has run as an urban gardening project within the framework of the Angelopoulos CGIU Fellowship by Angelopoulos Foundation since 2015. So far, the project has attracted the attention of the local press and several European organizations and research programs.\n\nWe are reaching out to citizens through a <a href=\"https://issuu.com/cityasaresource/docs/city_as_a_resource_portfolio\">dedicated website</a> and our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cityasaresource\">Facebook page</a>, which includes all information that needs to be transferred to potential beneficiaries.\n\nFor the participation in the garden activities, no special criteria are required. Everyone is welcome to contribute with his passion and willingness to the garden. Kipos3 \u00a0is an urban gardening project beyond cultivation of land for food provisioning.\n\n<strong>The people behind the idea</strong>\n\nMy name is Eleftheria Gavriilidou and in my early 30s, I have a degree in Architecture, and I am a post-graduate in the MLA Landscape Architecture School of Architecture of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. I work as an architect and I contribute to the \u2018Resilient Thessaloniki\u2019 project as a participant of the \u2018100 Resilient Cities\u2019 pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation. After getting a scholarship as a postgraduate student in 2014, I am in charge of the project \u2018Kipos3\u2019 working with many other partners. All these years, I had the chance to enrich my professional and academic experience participating in seminars, workshops, and conferences at national and international level.\n\nMy partner, Maria Ritou, has a degree in Agriculture, and she is a postgraduate in the MLA Landscape Architecture School of Architecture of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki too. She is in charge of the design activities of Kipos3 whereas I am more concerned in ecological activities of the vegetable garden.\n\nOur professional relationship runs on the basis of trust, respect, and mutual understanding. After two years of collaboration, we realize that we have learned many things from each other\u2019s capacities trying to construct a vegetable garden from scratch to approaching municipal and other local stakeholders.\n\nAlso, we really enjoy this feeling of pleasure and satisfaction when people get motivated by our ideas and share our vision for a sustainable neighborhood/ city. We feel blessed being supported by our families and friends who are involved with fresh ideas and their physical presence in the garden.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em>In what ways are you using a\u00a0</em><em>city</em><em> as a resource?

This set of rooms and bathrooms now function as the residential and work area of the unMonasterians. Please respect our need to rest and work away from the crowd during the gathering. The downstairs part of the building, the \"caves\", include the kitchen, 3 semi-continuous spaces for sessions, and 2 bathrooms. These spaces are public, and just as much yours as ours. We are happy to have you! Please note that the entire building closes at around 11pm, to make sure we get a good night sleep before our morning bell goes off at 7am.\n\n<strong>Beds:</strong>\n\nAll of our beds are claimed (<a href=\"/t/welcome-to-the-unmonastery/3769/5\">learn more on how they were allocated</a>). Unfortunately, we are unable to provide accommodation to more people. if you need assistance, please contact <a href=\"/u/natalia_skoczylas\">@Natalia_Skoczylas</a>, she will help you find something.\n\n<strong>The Kitchen:</strong>\n\nWe will prepare food - breakfast, lunch and dinner - for all LOTE participants between the evening of the 23rd until the evening of the 26th of October. To better estimate how much we need to cook, please sign your name on the list posted in the kitchen for each dinner (and indicate number of guests if applicable). To avoid producing too much waste, it would be great if you can bring at least a cup for yourself, and a plate and utensils also, if it is possible. We will have plastic cups, plates, etc for people who cannot bring their own. If you need a napkin, please bring a textile one.\n\nAs you can imagine, since we are feeding 60+ people, we will need a hand! Here is what we think it will take in terms of hands/time involvement:\n\nGroups/numbers/time:\n\n- SHOPPING (2 people/day = 1.5 hour)\n\n- BREAKFAST CLEANUP + garbage (2 person/day= 30 minutes)\n\n- LUNCH CLEANUP + garbage (2 person/day= 60 minutes)\n\n- DINNER COOKING (as many as possible, at least 5 = 2 hours)\n\n- DINNER CLEANUP (5 person/day = 2 hours)\n\n- DINNERTIME garbage (2 person/day = 30 minutes )\n\nPlease leave a comment if you would like to be added to the list, specifying which group you prefer to help in!\u00a0You will also be able to add yourself to the team on the spot, as soon as you arrive at Lote4.\n\nBathrooms:\n\nTo make sure they are clean, we will have a sign-up sheet to form teams.\n\n<strong>Garbage:</strong>\n\nWe select and recycle all our waste. There is a secondary raw material station with signs in the kitchen - we will also post a more detailed explanation. If you don't know what to do, just ask an unMonasterian.\n\n<strong>The unMonasterians:</strong>\n\nYou probably know some of us, but we will also wear a scarf to be recognisable. Once we have them, we will post a picture, so you know what to look out for.\n\n<strong>Our traditions:</strong>\n\nWe have a morning circle at around 8am, and a closing circle around 11pm. You are most welcome to join. Rules will be explained on site. Morning practice takes place on our balcony facing the gravina at 7.45, also open to all. Should you wish to try your hand at being an unMonasterian, please bring along a small stone - a talking piece* - to accompany your conversations. One of our most important traditions is sharing our meals - this is why we decided to cook for LOTE. We would be honoured if you decided to join us. Another important aspect of our stay in Matera was to make our best effort to meet, get to know, and involve local people. If you have friends in town, please bring them along.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you soon!\n\n(<a href=\"/u/ben\">@Ben</a>, <a href=\"/u/kei\">@Kei</a>, <a href=\"/u/bembo_davies\">@Bembo_Davies</a>, <a href=\"/u/mariabyck\">@mariabyck</a>, <a href=\"/u/julianavanh\">@julianavanh</a>, <a href=\"/u/marc\">@Marc</a>\u00a0- I just typed it up, please feel free to add/edit as you think fit - this is to inform all LOTE participants about what to expect at the unMonastery. <a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>, <a href=\"/u/natalia_skoczylas\">@Natalia_Skoczylas</a>, do you think anything is missed?)\n\n\u00a0\n\n*The talking piece is passed around the circle and the person holding the talking piece is the only one speaking.\u00a0 The holder of the talking piece is speaking with intent and the rest of the circle is listening with attention.\u00a0 Everyone in the circle has an opportunity to speak, and everyone has the right to pass the talking piece without speaking.\u00a0 Choose a meaningful talking piece.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-09 14:34:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:20.595451", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 897, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2334, 2160], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9206, "user_id": 45, "topic_id": 6119, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Extrinsic motivation</b>\n\nYou might find this relevant\n\n<a href=\"http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2006/02/phaedrus-on-church-of-reason.html\">http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2006/02/phaedrus-on-church-of-reason.html</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-02-14 23:12:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:52.993729", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 40, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 5, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-07-09 22:40:21.896654", "updated_at": "2017-07-09 22:40:21.896654", "deleted_at": "2017-07-09 22:40:29.877199", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22332, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5815, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Your call</b>\n\nHey, it's an opportunity.

By putting time and specialized skills (like language or design skills) at the disposal of new small enterprises,\u00a0 we take what we have (skills, time and talent) and use it to fill in the gaps left by what we don\u2019t have: access to investments of financial capital. This is self-help into employment for a largely unfunded generation. We can help each other to help ourselves. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n<strong>Why are we doing this?</strong>\n\nThe crisis deprives us of access to Capital, without which we cannot innovate, because if the innovation does not immediately succeed, we're homeless. A large scale culture of innovation requires a large scale culture of investment, and the money poured out of Education and Health into the banks is not returning to us in the form of access to investment. Our cultures are stuck.\n\nTo get out of this cycle of decline, we need access to \"Countercyclical Capital\" - something which gets more available as economic conditions get worse. Fortunately, this kind of Capital exists - it's called Human Capital. It's talented people without jobs, without incomes, without fully-utilized talents. As the economy ceases to provide work or affordable education, people become idle, and that's our reserve of Countercyclical Capital. We buck the trend!\n\nOur job, therefore, is to organize this Countercyclical Capital - that's us, we under-financed masses, yearning to create - into a form which permits Countercyclical Investment. We form a social organization, like a labour union, which permitsus to Collectivize our strengths, in a form which lets us change the way the world works for us and others. This improves our negotiating position, by making Talent powerful without access to (financial) Capital, and it might allow us to provide the much-needed innovation to help our societies out of their stuckness. The idea is to \"finance\" new positive, local projects using the collective power of an extended social network, with a commitment-based social structure to give us the ability to make decisions in a timely and business-like manner. You can read more about reasoning behind the idea <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-are-going-into-the-banking-business-and-staffing-up-are-you-with-us/1057\">here</a>.\n\n<strong>Is this a time bank?</strong>\n\nNo it isn't. Time banks encourage members to exchange labour. In these systems, participants\u2019 \u00a0time is used as \u201ccash\u201d - as an alternative to currency for small transactions. To the best of our knowledge, the transformative steps to turn participant commitments into a capital resource have never been taken.We ask our participants to commit a few days per year to the SC4SE fund. This time is pre-committed to the fund; That means the fund can value the assets given to it, and assure the enterprises it grants support to that they will get the help they need to get off the ground, unlike time banks which require continual fundraising efforts. A SC4SE Grant consists of a given number working hours. Participants from our network collaborate to self-organize this support in the form most useful to the enterprise. Typical uses might be design, translation or project communications review. It could also be used for remote jobs like scouting locations or giving presentations in a faraway city when funding is too scarce to travel there yourself.\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div><strong>So how are we, together with you, building it?</strong></div>\n\n<strong><em>Phase 1 - volunteers (no money/capital)</em></strong>\n\nIn this phase the Venture Social Capital Fund (VSCF) works as an interface between Edgeryders-volunteers and the clients. Edgeryders-volunteers are people from the Edgeryders community who commit to devote one day of their time + their skills to a project presented by the client. Clients are individuals, organizations, etc. who have an idea that can benefit their local community but who lack support in the form of volunteer work/expertise. At this point the Fund is not institutionalized.\n\nProcess step-by-step\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Creating a base of volunteers. Volunteers recruited to the VSCF indicate the skills they have and want to \u201cdonate\u201d (one day per year). They are grouped in guilds according to the type of their skills (i.e. translators, developers, legal consultants); each guild chooses a guild master and a person that will serve as a back-up for the guild master. The guild master is responsible for collecting information about the skills but also interests and passions of VSCF volunteers. The data collected should then be written down and shared. The role of a guild master is also to facilitate the choice and the connection between a volunteer and a client.</li>\n\n<li>First contact with the client. Client sends the project description to the VSCF and explains what kind of volunteer support is required. The decision on wether the project receives support is done in a way similar to the funding of projects through crowdfunding platforms -- if there are people willing to donate their time to project, the project gets the support. Additionally, a background check will be ran to find out whether there are any adverse or dangerous aspects of the project (or client-related).</li>\n\n<li>Assigning volunteers. Guild masters inform volunteers about the project that needs help. If a volunteer is interested in supporting the initiative, he/she informs the guild master about it (the information should be available for everyone in order to avoid chaos) and gets in touch with the client. The VSCF plays no additional role in the process. The agreement is between the client and the volunteer individually.</li>\n\n<li>Job done - story collecting. After the volunteers\u2019 job is done and the project is realized, the client should send to the VSCF a follow-up information about how the project develops and give feedback to the volunteers. As a result, VSCF should build a database of supported projects and cooperation history, which will later on be used in Phase 2 of the project.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIssues to be solved:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What software do we use for databases and communication?</li>\n\n<li>Who choses the guild masters and how long do they hold the position? Who checks clients and their projects?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong><em>Phase 2 - consultancy (money/capital) </em></strong>\n\nThe ER Venture Social Capital lead to questioning the organizational form of ER. After a first kick-off phase during which the volunteers meet the clients needs through a \u201cguild master\u201d, the creation of an consultancy interface between the ER VSCF and the client would be created in order to take in charge legal, financial intellectual property issues. The costs of the consultancy would be covered by the client (in kind, cash) to which the volunteering service is assured. Process step-by-step Each ER is worth 200\u20ac for his 1 day of work. As a start, the network would count on 1000 ER worth 200.000\u20ac of work value. As the network grows through reputation, p2p advising, ecc., the skill bank is going to be more diverse as well as better mapped. The ER VSCF is characterized not only for the quality of the volunteer work, but for a collective approach to specific client needs: the single needs are introduced into the community skill map, which can feed in and advise although only 1 volunteer will be appointed to the task. Collective intelligence is one of the main resources of the ER VSCF. The growing ER VSCF will inevitably lead to issues linked to funding, business, intellectual property, and tackle the organizational form.\n\nMore issues to be solved:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What is the turning point for the formation of the consultancy interface?</li>\n\n<li>How are the ER in charge of the interface chosen?</li>\n\n<li>Evaluation ex-post of the work</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2013-02-10 19:45:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:04.474043", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1367, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1154, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1121, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Last time I felt like this was when buried in writing my diploma thesis: I just emerged from about 20 hours of web research and I think I found many (most?) immediately relevant scientific research that I can build upon while developing the higher-performance version of the Economy App's network barter algorithm.\n\nHere are the articles which are most relevant articles for developing the algorithm itself.

Open ethnograpic tools for exemple uses the data to see what discussions are well connected.\u00a0\n\nCan healthcare systems work like Wikipedia, StackOverflow or other massively coordinated systems with very limited control and overhead ??\n\nTwo mechanisms at stake:\n\n\u00a01) self selection: individuals get involved in something because they want to, and contribute because they want to\n\n\u00a02) social networks: people and groups which move fluidly across organisations and shaping the norms as they wish\u00a0\n\n<strong>Case studies</strong> of how people access community care:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Clinics in Greece:\u00a0<a href=\"/t/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care-system/4880\">https://edgeryders.eu/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care-system</a>\n</li>\n\n<li>Alternative to 911 in the US:\u00a0<a href=\"/t/creating-a-compassionate-alternative-to-911/695\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/creating-a-compassionate-alternative-to-911</a>\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>What is op3ncare in short:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A place where we can share stories about care</li>\n\n<li>Where you can find people to support projects</li>\n\n<li>Where you can create solutions without being in the same place</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nQuestion by Loic: How to better the ergonomic of a website like edgeryders to be more user friendly? Answer: It is up to each person to better the platform: if you find good ways to better the geolocation for exemple, it is up to the community to work out. \\#Nospectators\n\nA: Facebook is extractive and advertisign driven; For OPENandChange purposes - we are prioritizing interaction as opposed to building a database and repository of projects\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">LISTENING TRIADS: what we've learned</h3>\n\nWinnie: he noticed that every project has some community in it, but communities experience different ways of being in the world, different incentives for being in a community.\n\nLaurent: 3 different projects which have something in common, with people being excluded by the system because they are poor or sick. Empowerment for these populations is at the core of each project. Behind each there is a diagnosis of how the excluded population can have lost access to institutional support.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf something is possible, it is on the edge, where people can regain access to their lives.\u00a0\n\nNadia: a matter of agency.\n\nLotfi: Nous \u00e9tions trois entit\u00e9, je suis avec Selvy, nous avons eu une maison de repos, xander travaille avec des enfants autiste, kacim, il espere qu'il pourait faire son metier de medecin. On a parl\u00e9 d'intergenerationel, comment cr\u00e9er des mini societ\u00e9 ou il y a des \u00e9change. Au dela d'un certain age: il y a pas de suport. Kacim a fait la paralel de comment le systeme de soin ce passe en moyen orient, une culture musulman de l'entraide. On impose de donner de l'argent au pauvre. Tous le monde vie ici dans son, pas de transversalit\u00e9.\u00a0\n\nXander:\u00a0 the community aspect is really important, the human is seen as a kind of predator, humans are also caring beings.\u00a0\n\nKacim: i have question to all of you: where are the families of the homeless people? I never saw anyone homeless in Syria, or living on a mattress.\u00a0How did it happen? He has to talk with Laurent about it.\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>the core family concept has been broken down - after uni and growing up you have to carry yourself; so there is no glue which keeps family together</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>ie in North Africa systems are weak -so there has always been a cultural support; whereas in the West the system is supposed to take care of everything</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Here (in the West) you are free,\u00a0but alone!</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\"Free, but alone.\" vs. \"Belonging,\u00a0 but coerced\" Comparing systems-based\u00a0 vs. family-based cultures of care\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alberto_cottica/status/779632492940783618\">https://twitter.com/alberto_cottica/status/779632492940783618</a>\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nJean: There is a desire of using new ways of technology to organize his place within the society je cherche a me socialiser, trouver une occupation profitable, mais je voudrais rester dans la marginalit\u00e9. Find a meaning in his life,\u00a0\n\nClaire: I want to create something can profide something that can give help to each other. It is very complicated to arrive there. With Laurent, Sophie, we have a point of connection, but we need to know each other better. I worked for several years around the project of selfcare. I want to do something very new. We are creating to work on a project on different levels in December with Laurent, but it is really difficult to find what is most needed: partnership and collaboration.\u00a0\n\nAdeline:\u00a0a part of HUID VDH team and more interested in what it is used to, how to be part of it.\u00a0She was triggered by the open&amp;change project\u00a0Everybody here came with a need, to find ways to come up with a solution,\u00a0tous le monde est venue avec un besoin, elle esp\u00e8re aider \u00e0 trouver une solution.\u00a0\n\nGilles:\u00a0Strongly believes in open source and data sharing solutions - everyone is looking for someone who can help them with a solution eg to develop a website to help the project moving.\u00a0\n\nLoic:\u00a0The core needs he noticed in others is to learn information about what others are doing, get information about collaborations; and second, the need for visibility. Personally he has come here for housing project, but Winnie's story is useful to hear also professionally.\n\nQuote by Kacim used again: WE ARE BOXED PEOPLE (link with Capsulaire Beschaving van Lieven De Cauter)\n\nYannick:\u00a0was in conversation with Kacim,Lotfi - the intergenerational interactions need to be looked into, because it is in only specific circumstances that we spend time together eg living in a house with my grandmother and the positive outcomes which came from that.\u00a0\n\nQUESTION TIME\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>How can communities become more visible and members interact more easily?</li>\n\n<li>How do you make the actions of the community visible to the individuals?</li>\n\n<li>How do you make individuals' actions more visible to the community?</li>\n\n<li>How can we help individuals be independent from official caring services?</li>\n\n<li>How do we invite more people to be part of the process and disseminate the documentation?</li>\n\n<li>How can we find the right balance between keeping the effectiveness of the box with still being able to go out of the box/</li>\n\n<li>What is the metaphor of what we are trying to do?

Because they are fed\u00a0up of all the social help,\u00a0they just want a happy life:\u00a0</em>it is not only important to have an home, but also to create great moments. To create equal relationships. Break racism against the poor.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\"><strong>Rozina: BIDs and building community</strong></h3>\n\nLiving in Bxl for 15 years, an interior designer coming from a corporate background working in the hospitality business. She started her own design company and got more involved in strategic design thinking - now involved with the Belgium Design Thinking. Projects to make the sports clubs more inclusive because they were closed for refugees; also hardly accessible by children with special needs. So with other people they pushed for inclusivity and speaking to the Belgium Football Union, but also preparing a strategy for the next few years.\n\nBusiness Improvements Design Belgium (BIDs): they are about creating a new geographical zone and linking community businesses to it, ideal for private - public partnerships.\n\nShe is lobbying for BIDs and wants to see where stakeholders can meet in the middle; seems idealistic especially since she's not from here.\n\nHas seen encouraging results after talking to her mayor, and right now she's trying to create a youth platform for citizenship and sports - an IDEO design type of commune.\u00a0\n\nWhat changed after the football? People understood there is a strategy and structure, so they get a sense of belonging. If everybody contributes something, we become as a community.\n\nWe educate the value of communication, transparency...\n\nRozina would need help to connect with people working hands on with special needs populations.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Loic: Right to Housing in Brussels</h3>\n\n<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.academia.edu/26771654/LE_DROIT_%25C3%2580_LHABITAT_PAR_LOCCUPATION&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1474883100851000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEF0GRHwYiKuDK65Jr1ZIuos3XvcA\" href=\"https://www.academia.edu/26771654/LE_DROIT_%C3%80_LHABITAT_PAR_LOCCUPATION\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.123rueroyale.be/\n\nhttps://www.academia.edu/<wbr></wbr>26771654/LE_DROIT_%C3%80_<wbr></wbr>LHABITAT_PAR_LOCCUPATION</a>\n\nPreviously office building occupied by the French community which had been vacant for 15 years.

Will we have the printed version of the book?\n\nI need this answers to know how to formulate my reasoning for interviewing people here in Armenia, as in the beginning we agreed on having 10 stories per country(yesterday I heard from some country managers that it is not feasible due to longer time required to complete each case study) thus the book was supposed to consist of 60 case studies in total. However later on we decided to have 14 stories in the book, so I do not want to misinform people by promising them their story will end up in the book, while this might not be the case.\u00a0\n\nPlease, feel free to comment and give your feedback. I think we need to decide on this asap.\u00a0\n\nOn my part I already have 4-5 stories almost ready(some posted, some coming up real soon) and another 4-5 stories coming up as soon as I finish working on the current stories. So I guess I will manage to provide at least around 6 quality case studies by the end of the deadline(beginning of August).\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-19 09:49:51", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 14:53:10.068895", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 378, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 47.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31955, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 4918, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>opencare communication recommendations</b>\n\nFollowing our hangout meeting of Thursday, April 28th [@melancon, @LuceChiodelliUB, @zoescope and @Costantino]\u00a0and according to what was decided on that day, a discussion took place between a small group of partners to come up with a number of recommendations on our communication strategy.\n\nSeveral aspects were taken into consideration:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A number of things were already done on the communication front (great video from LOTE5 rushes, community and research pages on the edgeryders.eu portal, etc).</li>\n\n<li>The activities taking place under the hat of opencare are twofold, they carry an intrinsic duality, that has recently been identified and distinguished under the terms \u201ccommunity\u201d and \u201cresearch\u201d.</li>\n\n<li>Partners all wish to be visible and seen as participating to the opencare EU funded initiative; they also wish the EU initiative to be visible as well on its own.</li>\n\n<li>The funded initiative relates more to the research component than to the community component although we must recognize \u00a0(and stimulate!) the necessary and profitable synergy acting within this twofold structure.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\nOur recommendations include:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>It is good practice, if not a necessity, to use a <strong>unique spelling </strong>for the project name.</li>\n\n<li>Although we are pushing for everything to take place online (in order to collect proper research material), we must not assume the crowd targeted by opencare to be as \u201cdigitally educated\u201d. As a consequence, the use of digits should be avoided as it resonates as some geekness or weirdness to some. This has a number of consequences as discussed below.</li>\n\n<li>A series of channels have been identified (some new, some less new) and could be used in the following manner:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Keep using the @op3ncare <strong>twitter </strong>login account but associate it with the opencare name. An existing twitter account already uses the @opencare login; other accounts use names similar but distinct from opencare (OpenCARE, Open Care with a blank space). This would make the already existing @op3care twitter account compatible with the opencare name spelling.</li>\n\n<li>This is already the case with the <strong>Facebook</strong> account pointing the op3ncare page (login) seen under the name opencare. We are not saying this Facebook account should only be used for research related stuff, we are suggesting it can comply with the above recommendations.</li>\n\n</ul></li>\n\n<li>Registration of these names has not been identified as urgent. When labelling our activity with the opencare label, the category (or class or activity type) rather than the name itself is as important. Because we adopt an open source strategy, we are protected against copyright infringement claims or ownership claims. \u00a0<em>[Edit 02/05/2016 -\u00a0</em><em>By browsing the website for the European Union\u2019s Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), it appears that the trademark <strong>OpenCare </strong>is already bought by a Japanese company for the product class we would be targeting (\u201cconsultancy, technological services and design\u201d). The name <strong>OpenCARE</strong> is also registered by a German company, hence the corresponding twitter account.]\u00a0</em></li>\n\n<li><span>We therefore choose the name <strong>opencare,</strong> which is the simplest version available that also meets the recommendations we listed previously.</span>\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>We maintain the use of the color and fonts that were adopted</strong>. \u00a0\n\nBlue and purple. We\u2019ll need to make this as precise as possible for future use (RGB, HSL encoding).\u00a0\n\nWe should stick to the use of Monserrat fonts.</li>\n\n<li>We need to have a <strong>channel where all project videos </strong>are published and made accessible, although some videos may also be published on other channels (Vimeo for instance, as is the case for the video shot at LOTE5).</li>\n\n<li>We recommend creating a <strong>Google+</strong> account associated with the opencare brand (<a href=\"https://business.google.com/create\">https://business.google.com/create</a>).\n\n- To start a Google+ page, we have to create a <strong>Gmail address first </strong>(<a href=\"mailto:opencare.h2020@gmail.com\">opencare.h2020@gmail.com</a>). This e-mail address shall not be shared / displayed nor used, - except for automatic replies, if the case presents itself.\n\n- This automatically creates an associated <strong>YouTube channel</strong>.\n\n- We may then follow the same @op3ncare / opencare login/name pairing as for twitter and Facebook.</li>\n\n<li>We need a <strong>landing page </strong>making the <a href=\"http://www.opencare.cc\">www.opencare.cc</a> URL visible and distinct from the edgeryders.eu portal.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>We keep this to a single page including:</li>\n\n<li>Project name and \u201cofficial\u201d spelling, project logo (network + heart)</li>\n\n<li>A one paragraph, elevator pitch, on the project</li>\n\n<li>A clearly visible, attractive, clickable and catchy motto bringing people to one of edgeryders.eu landing page.</li>\n\n<li>All EU and partners logos redirecting to each partner\u2019s official website.</li>\n\n<li>This page being distinct from edgeryders.eu makes it Drupal upgrade-proof.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdditional remarks:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The adoption of the above recommendations may have a number of <strong>consequences</strong> on work that has already been done. We need to decide <strong>who can take care of doing a series of things</strong>:</li>\n\n<li>The Facebook profile picture needs to be adjusted (to opencare)</li>\n\n<li>The LOTE5 video needs to be edited, so it shows opencare (and not Op3ncare) \u2013 keep it to a minimum (maybe only make sure the front image shows opencare instead of Op3nCare)</li>\n\n<li>Anything else?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>There does not seem to be any opencare (or OpenCare) GitHub account for now \u2013 just in case it would be useful to also have a GitHub account under the exact project name.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-03 13:38:30", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:53.236457", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1011, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8296, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1102, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Where in Matera is this happening?</b>\n\nIf others in Europe who are\u00a0in Matera this week would like to join, where / how should they meet you Ben?

I will share with you few things in hope it is beneficial :).\n\nHaven't felt depression in years, sadness very rarely and short termed. I believe sadness comes from our inability to accept a certain situation, our resistence to it. If there is a situation we don't like we have only two choices: Accept it as it is or change it or at least try to change it. In both situations we shouldn't be depressed. If de did all in our power and failed to change it, we should be satisfied with ourselves and accept the outcome, since there is no alternative. However i do believe once sadness comes we should not try to supress it, let it run its course because anything else would be commiting violence upon our own nature and sadness would still manifest itself somehow.\n\nGood at school, always calm and good kid, inventive, reading since i was 5, playing chess since my 6th year...i can't really tell how many times i heard my family members say this dreadful phrase to their children: \"just take Jasen's example, can't you be like him\".\u00a0\n\nThan i was 27, married, hated my job, didn't love my wife, i was miserable and had a lot of health issues. I started wondering: \"how did i end up right here at this moment in life?\" I knew i totally went off my path but didn't yet realise how or where is my path.\u00a0\n\nAfter realising\u00a0the community in which i grew up actually applied huge subconscious pressure on me through their projections of myself, through their expectations especially, and that so many of my life's actions were led by those thoughts in my head which were not really my thoughts. (i actually got married because everyone was telling me it's the right time and after some time it made sense...how crazy!).\n\nMy next step was\u00a0selfexploration, i had to get to know myself. I stayed at home reading books for months, Carlos Castaneda's books were an amazing discovery at that time. I went into nature for periods of isolation where i spent my time in silence and thought, and finally after some time i started meditating.\u00a0\n\nAs far as success is concerned i agree with Alberto. Should we measure ourselves in comparison to others or by finding our own system of values and definition of success? For example i have 0 debt, built my own house by the age of 28, a good\u00a0car and pretty much anything i need materially now...most of my friends think i am succesful. I would however consider myself succesful if i could succeed in creating a well balanced family full of love and respect, or if i could be nothing but a positive and inspiring experience for anyone who meets me. Or if i could attain permanent state of meditation for example. Also i have been with many women, and ofcourse friends\u00a0i went out with always considered me lucky or succesful with women. Well again my definition of success is very different: i would have preferred to stay with the first one i loved...or with any i loved. Now, in retrospective i rather think i failed miserably with some of those women and brought really bad kharma on me through those \"successes\" :).\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-26 01:42:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:23.750929", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 604, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7976, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5609, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Very interesting! </b>\n\nThanks for this great report.

Meanwhile, a methodological question that is going around (was mentioned at LOTE5 by Giulio Quaggiotto and Bob Palmer): would there be a way to ask people \"what are you doing to cope with this problem?\" rather than (or perhaps as well as) \"what problem do you have?\". The reasoning is this: if you cast people as \"beneficiaries\" they tend to behave\u00a0as beneficiaries, and put themselves in a more passive position. But if you cast them as problem-solvers, they will behave in a braver, more active way. This is called \"mapping assets, not needs\". But honestly, I am not sure it makes sense with small numbers of people.

As always, it helps! So let's go on with the discussion a bit:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Time:</strong> Yes, you can hand out a voucher for now. Hacking the system like that\u00a0is appreciated even :-) If you include a voucher for a specific product or service as \"debt\", then a train ticket is also debt. And the time between order and shipment of physical goods is also debt. Such debt is essential in trade. It does not create trust problems with the exchange mechanism itself (as debt does in time banks), since it is P2P debt: you know who owes you what, and you chose the seller in the first place based on your trust that he or she will deliver the promised product or service. P2P debt is also not transferable (so, tied to that personal trust relationship and context). While the collectivized debt has neither of these attributes (and creates the fuzzy free rider problem for time banking).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Uncertainty:</strong> Again, the conditional voucher is a good idea to hack the system. Some other implementation of network barter may support uncertainty (like investments, with risk levels) explicitly. Economy App does not, since it's focused on mutual support through goods and services.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Identity:</strong> Let me tie this to the discussion about the Commons, as you already started doing. Following the thoughts of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom\">Elinor Ostrom</a>, a commons is a resource with flatrate access to insiders, who are expected to use it responsibly, but also has or should have clear boundaries regarding who is an outsider without access. This can indeed scale up to manage large amounts of resources, like community-managed forests. However, the subtitling exercise has no \"boundaries of the commons\": no flatrate access rights to unMonastery resources, or sense of ownership, can be derived from taking part. Instead, it was a fun exercise for everyone involved (including myself). That's fine, it just does not scale: everyone of us has only so much resources to invest for fun. This makes us come back to the problem you realized at the <a href=\"/t/should-we-be-working-in-teams-thoughts-after-translating-sams-video/2279\">beginning of this discussion</a>: if we want to facilitate the tenfold or hundredfold amount of Edgeryders' collaboration, we are in need of a compensation scheme. The Commons idea seems of limited use to me, as it only regulates how people contribute to their own commons, not to projects of other Edgeryders. The Harmonious Hackathon approach is ingenious in its own way, as it is a rare direct barter opportunity adapt for inter-project collaboration. But it does not apply to all tasks and contexts (not to a quick need for subtitling for example): it's useful, but not for all our needs. Indirect barter (like in Economy App) is useful for all kinds of stuff though.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nNow many (me included) intuitively do not like the idea of putting price tags on everything when bartering ... it's sounds like the beginning of objectification of all and everything, and like a way in again for interest rates, debt-backed securities etc. again. The alternative would be indirect barter without price tags. It has been tried (like on <a href=\"http://www.barterquest.com/\">BarterQuest</a> or <a href=\"http://www.netcycler.com/\">NetCycler</a>), but in my view nobody got it to work yet: there, transactions require a lot of manual coordination effort and are easily frustrated by one veto in a potential ring barter, so they are way too rare for a well-working economic exchange mechanism. For this reason, we looked for ways to search and close indirect barter deals automatically, and the only solution we have so far includes price tags on offers. That's the tradeoff we made to enable collaboration not just in relatively close, trusting communities like Edgeryders, but also between near-strangers. Which seems like a prerequisite for generally applicable economic exchange mechanims.\n\nIndeed, as you noted, it is not clear who is indebted to whom in the subtitling example. That would only become clear when the transaction logic of barter is applied to <em>everything</em>, including a membership fee to be paid in barter for sustaining the Edgeryders operations like LOTEs and website. I'm pretty sure we do not want transaction logic to penetrate all that. But barter is also open to gift culture: instead of membership fees, Edgeryders could support its platform by donating small amounts of barter value to it (hacking Economy App for it: Edgeryders offers \"digital thank-yous\" with a price tag, donors just order that product). Network barter would now map these donations as income of the Edgeryders platform user to its expenses for sustaining Edgeryders, like paying a community manager in barter value. So in contrast to now, large chunks of work would not need to be volunteer efforts but would be compensated from everyone's small donations. Distributing the load like this is a benefit of the transaction logic ... a benefit you get for accepting price tags :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-21 03:05:10", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:41.563390", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 879, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8640], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5065, "user_id": 2694, "topic_id": 5032, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The first time I talked to <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>\u00a0about finances he mentioned he would love to invite David Graeber to a conference on finance.\n\nI proceeded reading his book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years\">Debt: the first 5000 years</a>\u00a0and discovered everything I knew about finance (not much) was a lie, so I couldn't possible agree more.\n\nLet's try to get in touch!

The Economy App fits in perfectly: values that come from the past (such as the barter culture) enabled and promoted through digital technology. It's not about putting the \"digital\" adjective behfore or behind every word, but it's about using the digital technology to enable and support practices which carry values which we commonly associate to so-called traditional cultures.\u00a0\n\nAs you said, Matera - through Matera2019 - offers powerful metaphor and visuals: this is what is so striking about the city, but alas this also beholds a danger: rhetoric. Antoher theme is \"Connection and contemplation\", understood as a place which allows deep inner contemplation and inispiration and brings to creation and connection with others. This second step (the connection) is not automatic and has not always been done: there have been people which came and went without leaving anything significative but a bunch of empty words. In time, this has created a sense of skepticism. The story of Matera is filled with evocative metaphors and powerful declarations of intents which remained as such.\u00a0\n\nin 2009\u00a0I bumped into the group of youngsters that where advocating for Matera to become candidate city to European Capital of Culture in 2019. At the time I was studying how Matera passed from \"national shame\" (in the 50's) to UNESCO World Heritage. The risk of creating yet another occasion for adding a label to the city with no concrete consequences on the quality of life was real and,\u00a0although diminushed today, still exists. Projects such as unMonastery or\u00a0Economy App are exactly what we need to fuel a healthy sense of pragmatic advocating for an alternative way of making the city.\n\nMatera's Sassi remind us every day the origins of the maker culture. But Matera's external neighbourhoods also tell us how low our building culture can get to when we totally delegate our power of decision to others. I am positive that the EdgeRyder community can empower the local community by showing in what way digital technology can enable processes without waiting for public money, public authorities or political benediction: \"innovation without permission\", as an Italian journalist recently wrote.\u00a0\n\nMatt, if you want to write a blogpost on the Economy App, I am sure that we can then translate it in Italian and the webteam would be thrilled to dispatch it through social network: also, this could give a pragmatic approach to the ongoing discussion on resilience which risks taking a very theoretical turn!\u00a0\n\nMatera: digital making capital!\n\nStay\u00a0tuned!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-01 05:12:35", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:25.286660", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 495, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1615, "user_id": 31, "topic_id": 1582, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<b style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:medium;font-weight:normal\"><span>All Europeans are directly or indirectly supported by public health services.

Making Lote3 has taught us a lot of\u00a0<span>valuable skills how to coordinate all the ingredients of the live meeting</span>, mostly via an online collaboration. It was few months of preparations to make Lote3 happen. We have had regular meetings once or sometimes twice or more times per week to keep all the preparations going smoothly. We have built many things collaboratively, like the event site, the program, sometimes fixing many \u2018little things\u2019 behind the scenes, and making sure everything works fine. And with the joint effort we made it happen.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat we have learned is that making the event is a process, that is not only focusing on the event itself, but also on\u00a0<span>how we are actually making it</span>. It\u2019s a collaborative process.

ideas for project name appreciated)\n\nThe project aims develop agroecological land based livelihoods by providing access to land and skill sharing.\n\nThe project seeks to explore novel collaborative approaches to try to overcome common barriers to developing land based productive livelihoods.\n\nLack of skills\n\nLack of time\n\nLack of resources\n\nLand price\n\nEstablishing and maintaining a land based livelihood independently is extremely demanding of both time and attention.\u00a0 Gaining an understanding of the land and the local market while honing the skills necessary to develop a livelihood leaves little time for other activities.\u00a0 Being able to reside on the land is highly advantageous as it provides constant direct access to the land.\u00a0 No time and money spent traveling, and the ability to easily keep an eye on things.\u00a0 Unfortunately land with accommodation is expensive. \u00a0\n\nHaving a mortgage to pay while developing a new livelihood is not an ideal situation to be in.\u00a0 Especially when the home and livelihood are interdependent.\u00a0 Agricultural land can be purchased and residential planning permission sought, often successfully, but the time, money and skills necessary to achieve permission are significant and take attentions away from developing land based production.\n\n<strong>Acquiring Land</strong>\n\nPurchasing agricultural land without residential permission greatly reduces the cost of the land.\u00a0 By focusing on crops that do not require constant attention, like orchards or field crops, project participants can stay on the land in temporary accommodation as seasonal workers at key times of the year.\n\nLand could also be leased with terms suitable to allow project development.\u00a0 Agricultural land rental is surprisingly cheap - less than \u00a3100/acre/year\n\nSympathetic land owners may sell or lease land at advantageous rates,\n\n<strong>Building a commons</strong>\n\nThe project aims to build a commons around developing agroecological land based livelihoods.\u00a0 Methods of land acquisition, land management and livelihood development will be explored through collaborative processes.\u00a0 This knowledge will be freely shared to foster both continued development of the project and the ability of others to become involved in similar activities.\n\nThe project will also have assets of land, tools and produce that will be held in common and managed through collaborative processes.\n\nThe project will be open for people to become involved with governance, administration or land work.\n\n<strong>Future developments</strong>\n\nThe project could expand, purchasing further land and developing production so that attention at different sites is required at different times of year.\u00a0 Workers accommodation could be moved from site to site as appropriate.\n\nPlanning permission for more permanent facilities could be sought, and possibly more easily justified, to allow activities on a site to be developed more intensively.\n\nIndividuals may choose to develop their livelihoods within the project or use the skills and contacts gained to develop an independent livelihood.\n\n<strong>Finance</strong>\n\nThe project will be financed through open contributions.\u00a0 The exact mechanisms for this needs developing and will be somewhat dependent on the corporate form of the project (also in need of development).\u00a0 Ideally people can put money in and take it out as necessary.\n\nSome kind of timed withdrawal, either repayment at fixed time, as loanstock, or a certain amount of notice, would alternative funding to be secured or land to be sold to meet requirement of investors.\n\nPossible models - cooperative issuing loanstock, community share offer, crowd funding\n\n<strong>Example possible new commoners</strong>\n\nAndrea -\n\nLives and works in the city and has a well paid job but always wanted to live in the country closer to nature.\u00a0 She grows some salad in the window of her flat.\u00a0 She is saving money so that she can escape the rat race.\u00a0 She uses the project as somewhere she feels happy to invest her savings - she knows what the money is being used for and is happy to be supporting the project.\u00a0 She takes time off work so she can get involved with work on the land and meet like minded people.\u00a0 She values the social interaction and feels great when she takes home produce from the land.\u00a0 She is actively involved with the project governance, attending meetings when she can and participating in decision making.\n\nTony -\n\nTony has retired from a job-for-life in the accounts department of the district council.\u00a0 He is concerned about environmental issues.\u00a0 He is active in the local Transition Town network.\u00a0 He thinks it would be better if there were lots more small, local food producers.\u00a0 He supports the project by helping with the accounts and even though he isn't as strong as he was when he was younger he still likes to spend an afternoon doing some work on the land from time-to-time.\u00a0 He has invested some of his savings in the project/ He attends meetings and is involved in decision making.\n\nPhilip -\n\nPhilip has not been able to get a job since he left school three years ago.\u00a0 He likes the countryside and cooking and he regularly goes out collecting wild food.\u00a0 He was very interested to read about the project in the local paper and went to the land for an open day.\u00a0 He stayed on the land for a few weeks during the winter and learnt how to prune the apple and pear trees in the orchard.\u00a0 He has been to a few of the projects governance meetings.\n\nKaren -\n\nKaren has done an apprenticeship in organic vegetable production but has been unable to find the money to set up as a grower.\u00a0 She joined the project and is very happy that she has so much support - she does not have to worry about selling the stuff she grows or how she is going to find the money to buy seeds in the spring.\u00a0 She does not like meetings but is involved in the governance through talking to other people in the project and letting them know what she thinks about what she considers are important issues.\n\nSophie -\n\nSophie is a busy working mother.\u00a0 She does not have much time to get involved with the project but puts money in to pay for expenses and receives a share of the produce that the project grows.\u00a0 She likes to visit the land with her children sometimes when she can grab a spare day so that they can see and be a bit involved in the production of their food.\u00a0 She does not have much time to be involved in the governance of the project but does read the project email list and comment if she thinks something is important.\u00a0 She is set to receive some money from a dead relatives estate and is considering investing some of it in the project.\n\nMark -\n\nMark has been an itinerant farm worker for a number of years.\u00a0 He traveled up and down the country doing seasonal farm work - hop twiddling, apple picking and pruning, daffodil picking.\u00a0 He often worked for low wages and was not sure when he would get work or for how long it would last.\u00a0 He was happy to find the project and get involved.\u00a0 He is glad that he has a say in the running of the project and that he is able to use his farming skills.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-28 00:27:54", "updated_at": "2017-09-25 12:19:19.472290", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1411, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 46.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2334, 209], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24535, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2539, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Shift happens: perspective is everything...</b>\n\nBeka, Nana.

Think of it like a petri dish - what is needed to cultivate care? Though yes, architecture &amp; space have an impact.\u00a0\n\nThe Peckham Experiment sounds a bit like the <a href=\"http://www.bbbc.org.uk/\">Bromley By Bow Centre</a>\u00a0which I visited last year. They have a GP surgery on site but its very much integrated with a range of other activities - from a cafe providing employment and offering food prepared from Fair Share donations to workshop and artists space.\u00a0\n\nIt also stems from our own observations in our <a href=\"http://www.galgael.org\">work</a> - which kind of took a permaculture take on what was working for the people who had been engaged in our project over the years. What was very obvious was that it was the settings and 'environment' created in the workspace that was as important as the work we were doing. So for example, creating spaces 'round a kitchen table' was conducive to peer support as opposed to professional support. I like the notion of 'networked reciprocity' @Alberto mentions. We've been calling it\u00a0frameworks of social solidarity.\u00a0\n\nThis led me to propose this\u00a0theme with a hope\u00a0of\u00a0connecting up with others who share some curiousity about this and related topics. I'm also particularly struck by the amount of energy that goes in to forming or influencing policy. This seems to be an instrument of an old world view that imagined human progress would lead us to predicting everything. What would be a) a more productive use of people's time and b) contribute to improved outcomes in relation to the often laudable intentions behind these policies? In Scotland, I see this happening on a national level - recently there was an academic paper published on the <a href=\"http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2016/11/23/groundhog-day-explaining-50-years-of-failed-renewal/\">failed regeneration policies</a> pursed over the last 30-40 years, costing millions of public money that have left the deprived areas that were targeted still at the bottom of the league table. But also in our own organisation, policy responses to issues such as addiction seem a little useless. What do other responses look like? Citizen led responses that include a rich mix of\u00a0culture, values, new skills, awarenesses and practices. How do we work with this more skillfully?\n\nAppreciate your thoughts and experiences.

Carlo, with his team, has created <a href=\"http://opinionage.com/\">Opinionage</a>- a tool for sparking public debates around issues you care about and making them visible to decision makers and the other way around.\n\n<strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Because in order for an issue to engage a broad range of people in a debate some kind of \u201csimple hook\u201d is needed to get people to state their opinions and argue for them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>How does it work?</strong> In a nutshell <strong>Opinionage is a \"virtual round table for decisions\"</strong> where different people (e.g. citizens, government representatives and observers such as the press, NPOs..) meet to address and discuss public topics. The main objective is to help people break down any barrier with public institutions, share thoughts and let emerge ideas/proposals about needs, expectations and problems.\n\n<strong>The big challenge </strong>is to persuade large institutions to \"sit down in front of citizens\" to start public debates. Carlo says <em>\"I'm very passionated about technology, I built my first program when I was 10 years old. Since I didn't have access to any computer, I wrote my first program on a paper to give to a friend of mine whose father owned... of course it didn't work but I really didn't care because it was so amazing! I'd spent 8 years in building an Enterprise Feedback Management platform before starting Opinionage. When I did my first business trip to the Silicon Valley in 2010 I was so ravished by the \"social wave\" that I turned my focus from \"enterprises\" to \"people\": hence Opinionage started to spontaneously emerge.\"</em>\n\nDo you have any experience to share as to spark a debate about a topic amongst a broad range of participants online?

From a Palestinian perspective, comparing the situation of Palestinian refugees to other refugee populations is to introduce resettlement as a solution to the problem and thereby to compromise their right of return.</span>\n\n<span>Over the years, the demands of the Palestinian national movement and the parameters of international law as they relate to the conflict have converged, such that, in final-status negotiations, the Palestinian positions are grounded in international law, while the Israeli positions are based on the present reality (which is increasingly recognized as an illegal reality) and Israeli security requirements. The official Israeli understanding of those security requirements is also premised on exceptionalism: that Israel will forever face extraordinary security challenges, irrespective of Palestinian-Israeli peace or even a comprehensive regional peace.</span>\n\n<span>These notions of exceptionalism are changing, although in incomplete ways. For the BDS movement, the paradigm is clearly apartheid South Africa and, to a lesser extent, Northern Ireland and the US civil rights movement. For those actors (like the EU) looking to revive the two-state model by denying recognition to Israeli expressions of sovereignty over Palestinian territory (e.g. by disqualifying Israeli institutions affiliated with settlements from participating in EU-funded R&amp;D projects), the paradigm is one of economic dealings with occupied territories: Crimea, northern Cyprus, Western Sahara, etc.</span>\n\n<span>Among the aspects that, I would suggest, are not unique to Israel/Palestine and might be discussed at the conference are:</span>\n\n<span>-the decay of the Palestinian national movement as it has progressed from revolutionary to institutional, and its inability to extricate itself (in a responsible way) from the Oslo Accords, such that it has the schizophrenic twin identities as a national liberation movement and an instrumentality of the Israeli military government in the occupied territory; and</span>\n\n<span>-a singular focus on a geopolitical outcome (two states) without regard for whether that model provides for true self-determination for the constituent groups (Israeli Jews, Palestinians in the 1967 occupied territory, Palestinian citizens of Israel, Palestinian refugees and the diaspora), and thus, I would suggest, without regard for the sustainability of that model.</span>\n\n<span>I hope this makes sense and is helpful.</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-04 17:08:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:27.902530", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 609, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2694, 8, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9254, "user_id": 99, "topic_id": 1625, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Edge Pictures BY MEDHIN Conference/Unconference </b>\n\n<h2><strong>Link to EdgePictures</strong></h2>Day 1\n\nhttps://picasaweb.google.com/109066848383695760844/EdgePhotos14thJune2012ByMedhin14Giugno2012?authkey=Gv1sRgCPCN7_PAif6WygE#\n\nDay 2\n\nhttps://picasaweb.google.com/109066848383695760844/EdgePhotos15thJune2012ByMedhin?authkey=Gv1sRgCKfE1Iaxg4OJ3QE\n\n\\#LOTE\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-17 08:19:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:53.284696", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 46, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26870, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3563, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Feedback on objectives of this video (via email from Riel, 16/9)</b>\n\nObjectives that this video should contribute to:\n\n1.

In the stewardship we explored whether it is possible for networked communities to achieve complex tasks at scale, specifically we asked whether networked communities could take care of public assets like unused buildings.\n\nSo far we have looked at the supply side- that it has a high cost to collaborate, to keep a network going.

It\u2019s been a long known fact that Greece\u2019s agriculture and farming sectors have significant growth potential, especially for organic production and niche products/markets. With the right climate, soil, and geographical diversity, we believe that hemp cultivation can flourish in Greece. As a result of recent legislation, we established<a href=\"https://kannabio.wordpress.com/\"> KANNABIO</a>, the first organic hemp social cooperative in the country, just a few days after the ministerial decision was signed.\n\nKANNABIO has as a mission to promote Greek hemp as a quality product of origin and assist the development of the industry in Greece. Our goal is to get involved in organic and cooperative farming and processing, to produce quality organic hemp products, to promote the social and solidarity economy and protect the environment. Moreover, we undertake participatory research on hemp cultivation and processing, raise awareness about the benefits of hemp for the economy and the environment, while providing expertise, networking and promotion opportunities to local farmers.\n\nOur founding members are involved in hemp trade since 1998 and are at the forefront of the legalization campaign in Greece since 2005. Two of the farmers-partners of KANNABIO are among the first three farmers to receive permission for hemp cultivation in Greece in 2016. Both of them owned hemp shops that were raided by police in 1998 and their products (clothes) were confiscated, while they faced a lengthy trial period for many years before they got acquitted but never compensated.\n\nKANNABIO\u2019s vision for Greek organic hemp is to become an international standard of organic quality through cooperative cultivation and processing. We want to lay the foundations for the promotion and sustainable use of the plant, and we want to actively contribute to the establishment of a healthy and cooperative hemp market in Greece, by supporting sustainable agricultural practices and rural development. As such, we oversee the production of organic hemp oil extraction products, nutritional supplements, and personal hygiene products, as well as the production of hemp-lime for eco-friendly building materials.\n\nWe want to promote cooperative principles and a philosophy of working collaboratively. We don\u2019t focus narrowly on the commercial side of hemp, but our aim is to provide awareness, training, engagement, jobs and social consciousness, alongside the production of quality, organic health and nutrition products. In this effort, we aim to create novel healthy products that can contribute daily to the health of citizens, but also provide natural and accessible supplements to patients of various serious diseases.\n\nCurrently, we are finalizing a business investment plan in order to attract investment for establishing a small-scale cooperative production unit of hemp oils, hemp nutritional and personal hygiene products. Our production target for 2017 is to sign contracts with farmers for 25 hectares. In parallel, KANNABIO hemp co-op has developed a more integrated vision for cooperative hemp cultivation and processing in Greece, to support the establishment of the Greek hemp industry. This includes the creation of a mobile Hemp Caravan Museum that will travel all around Greece visiting different cities, organizing public events with guest speakers and guided exhibition tours for key stakeholders (farmers, processors, traders, public officials) and the wider public.\n\nThis action will bridge the knowledge gap that 60 years of hemp prohibition created and will contribute to capacity building and sensitization of farmers, professionals on the market and consumers about prospects of cooperative hemp cultivation and processing. Moreover, our cooperative vision includes the creation of a large-scale hemp processing unit producing fiber, shivs, flowers, seeds and dust, also including a production line of hemp insulation and construction material.\n\nCooperative business plan\n\nThe social cooperative will employ by priority unemployed, skilled youth and women, 35% of its net earnings will be reinvested in the cooperative, its employees and the creation of new jobs, while it will be governed by its shareholders. The shareholders will hold one vote each in the General Assembly, independently of the amount of shares they own (no more than 5% of the company share value for each shareholder).\n\nWe strongly believe and we have proposed to state authorities that in Greece, we have the capacity and the potential for the creation of 10 cooperative processing units in 10 different regions, that will be able to process at least 2.500 hectares each, by utilizing abandoned industrial facilities all over the country. Our long-term vision is the Cooperative Greek Hemp Industry to cultivate and process 25.000 hectares of hemp in 10-15 years time, converting more land into sustainable practices.\n\nFinally, our cooperative plan includes the establishment of a non-profit Hemp R&amp;D Foundation that will develop Greek hemp breeds by utilizing past and ongoing research and will provide technical support for cultivation and processing. The Foundation will also provide applied research and applications on cooperative schemes and practices for hemp cultivation and processing.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-14 05:30:20", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 14:33:41.361596", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 894, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15552, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 5978, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>invitation + eventbrite</b>\n\n@Noemi\u00a0\n\ninvitation only for the day\n\npublic event (with eventbrite) for the night\n\nps:\u00a0\n\nwhat about master of network? as you know we have limited space here @ wemake\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-18 10:58:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:27.502416", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 47, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 875, "user_id": 3674, "topic_id": 842, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi there!\n\nThe open rampette project has quickly moved forward to the design phase.

Maybe there are other strategies, but this one appers to me particularly interesting and potentially generative.\n\nGiven that, how to go on?\n\nOn my side, I can make some steps in the direction I know better, i.e. A1, leaving others to help me to find bridges with B1.\u00a0\u00a0If this makes sense, the first step is to ask you, to give me some feedbacks on the other parts of my post above (they went \u00a0the A1 vs\u00a0B2 options!).\u00a0\u00a0I would like to have, if possible, some feedbacks on them too.\n\nHere I will highlight some one first, and in my view crucial, point. In my original note I wrote:\n\n\u201c<em>The practical/organizational side of care is particularly important because care is not only exchanging information and knowledge. Care asks also for proximity and action: doing something for each other, taking time and being committed.\u201d</em>\n\nWriting that I want to underline, is that care (by the points of view of who, in a given moment, need care), requires proximity and continuity. These proximity and continuity is, in a my opinion, a major difference with other, mainly information-based activities (that often can work also without them).\n\nTherefore, if as Nadia also says, a care strategy could be the one of \u201c<em>spreading the burden of care over more people\u201d,\u00a0</em>the first problem that appears is that their different bits of care activity have to be perceived, and by all means, be, from the point of view of who in that moment is the care receiver, as deliveres with continuity: the different care giver must appear as one continuous entity operating in proximity.\n\nIn my notes I indicated one case that I think could be interesting by this point of view and that I invite you to invite you see: the case of Tyze, in Canada.\n\nIn my view this case is very interesting but \u2026 it is presented as a private, and therefore, closed, network of care! What do you think?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-18 08:16:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:27.347241", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 582, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9028, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3765, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>I'm in!</b>\n\nFrom the little I know Anne Marie since last year I was expecting a session on this.\n\nI guess what we didn't really go into at Lote3 is the process, namely how is the collaboration with public libraries working out?

In our fluid, hyper-individualized societies, families, village communities and urban neighborhoods are weakening (if not totally disappearing). Individuals, given their life structure, have less and less practical possibilities to take care of others (even when, in principle, they would do it).\u00a0\n\nCare institutions, which were supposed to substitute the traditional community\u2019s and individual\u2019s care, have fewer and fewer economic resources (and often political will) to do it.\u00a0\n\n<strong>The gap between the growing demand and the shrinking offer of care is the basis of the present care crisis</strong>: a lack of care that is <strong>practical</strong> (the caring system do not succeed in coping with the care demand) as well as <strong>psychological</strong> (the sense of loneliness deriving from the lack of sense of care throughout the whole society).\u00a0\n\nTo overcome this crisis brand new care systems have to be imagined and enhanced.\u00a0A first step is to better understand caring activities, considering their nature and diversity.\u00a0\n\nThe practical/organizational side of care is particularly important because care is more than exchange of information and knowledge. Care requires proximity and action: doing something for each other, taking time and being committed.\n\n<em><strong>Care activities. </strong></em>Care activities are quite diverse: they can be performed by whoever could be willing to do it (as shopping for groceries for somebody who is temporarily sick); they can require a lot of time, attention, and assumption of responsibility (as taking care of the daily life necessities of somebody seriously ill); they can require timely actions by highly specialized experts (as performing\u00a0surgery in very specific moments). And so on. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn general terms, these differences are characterized by a set of main parameters:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1917-a873-0b68-ac2722e17ca6\"><em>Time</em>: duration, frequency, flexibility, \u2026</b>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1917-a873-0b68-ac2722e17ca6\"><em>Space</em>: virtual, hybrid, only physical, \u2026</b>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1917-a873-0b68-ac2722e17ca6\"><em>Competences</em>: normal everyday life socialization, specific diffuse knowledge, specialized expert knowledge, \u2026</b>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1917-a873-0b68-ac2722e17ca6\"><em>Responsibility</em>: very low; low, high, very high.</b>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nDifferent care actions should be attentively analyzed and mapped using these parameters. Intuitively, we can already say that different care activities could be delivered by different actors in different modalities.\u00a0\n\n<em>To imagine a new care system, we </em><em>should</em><em>\u00a0recognize all the potential </em><em>caregivers</em><em> and consider them as resources. Either as effective care resources (when they are already active). Or as potential care resources (when they can be\u00a0activated under certain conditions)</em>\n\n<strong><em>Care resources</em>.</strong> In principle, everybody can care for someone else. He or\u00a0she can do it in different forms (depending on his/her expertise and time availability), but all of them require attention. In turn, given that attention is a limited resource (each person has a limit in his/hers capability to give attention), this is true also for his/her capability to care. Care (both the expert and non-expert one) is a diffuse but limited resource.\u00a0\n\nPresently, care systems are built on a mix of three main resources:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1917-5d15-b4d1-29f7e20c6e6d\">Institutional care givers (based on professional actors)</b>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1917-5d15-b4d1-29f7e20c6e6d\">Third sector and charity organizations (based on both professional and nonprofessional actors)</b>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1917-5d15-b4d1-29f7e20c6e6d\">Traditional care communities (as families, village communities, urban neighborhoods ).</b>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<em>We know that, for different reasons, all of them are in difficulty to cope with the growing care demand. Therefore, the issue is to reshape the system in order to permit to new potential resources to </em><em>emerge</em><em> and become effective resources.\u00a0</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<em><strong>Mainstream and countertrends.</strong></em> We have said that, in principle, everybody, depending on his/her time and expertise, could give some forms of care. But we can observe that today, in the contemporary societies, this care potential, clashes with the dominant culture and practice.\u00a0In the name of individual freedom and convenience, our culture\u00a0tends to assume a careless approach to everything and everyone (the throwaway society extended from things to human relationships). And: a mainstream practice of living that makes it difficult to introduce care activities in the daily life (due to work constraints, to the evolution of families and to their being scattered in different places).\n\nTherefore, given the present structures of family and work, few people can commit to offering care, especially if this requires continuity, high responsibility and duration in time.\n\nNevertheless, several examples tell us that there still are several people who could and would dedicate some time/energy/attention to well-defined caring activities - if and when an appropriate enabling system would permit them to do it in an easy and flexible way.\n\nThis limited but diffuse caring availability is the potential resource that the socio-technical innovation should be capable to transform in an effective resource. \u00a0\n\nIn other words, thanks to an appropriate socio-technical innovation, it should become possible to cultivate and harvest the limited individual caring resources of broader groups of subjects. That is, to catalyze and coordinate existing but not used care resources could be the key to overcoming the crisis of care in contemporary societies.\n\n<strong>Hypothesis and vision</strong>\n\n<strong><em>Hypothesis.</em></strong> If the close (social or institutional) organizations of the past cannot cope with the dimension and complexity of the present demand of care, they must be opened. That is: the care activities must be divided in smaller/lighter tasks, and allocated to a large number of actors, each one giving what he/she is capable/willing to give.\u00a0\n\n<strong><em>Vision.</em></strong> Open care is an ecosystem of care-related interactions, characterized by being distributed among a large number of individuals, groups and institutions, with different competence, responsibility and commitment: \u00a0from the highly specialized actors and institutions\u00a0to family members, friends and neighbours with no specific knowledge and limited time availability.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Viability</strong>\n\n<strong><em>Social preconditions and enabling systems. </em></strong>To be viable, open care requires two main social preconditions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-191f-5fe9-ccc0-270e87fbb827\">The existence of a large number of other actors (relatives, friends, neighbors) willing to care for someone, even though they have practical limits (in terms of time and resource availability).</b>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-191f-5fe9-ccc0-270e87fbb827\">The existence of dedicated and specialized actors capable of intervening when their competencies are (really) needed.</b>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nGiven the previous social preconditions, the open care potentialities are made real thanks to the existence of a technological and organizational system capable of catalyzing \u00a0diffuse resources, coordinate them and give their action the needed continuity. More precisely, this enabling system should:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<em><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1922-ad94-a638-d19221924b51\">match different demands with different offers (in terms of competence)</b></em>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<em><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1922-ad94-a638-d19221924b51\">give different care actions coherence and continuity (from the point of view of the care receiver)</b></em>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<em><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1922-ad94-a638-d19221924b51\">promote and support both relational and the highly effective ones (i.e. the most specialized, professional interventions).</b></em>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<em><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1922-ad94-a638-d19221924b51\">be organically part of </b></em><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1922-ad94-a638-d19221924b51\"><em>a larger systems</em></b><em><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1922-ad94-a638-d19221924b51\">: the ecosystem of interactions that represents what today we can refer to as a local community. </b></em>\u200b\u200b</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Social innovation and open care</strong>\n\nThe open care viability is based on the existence of a whole stream of social (and socio-technical) innovation that is already moving in a similar direction.\u00a0\n\nIn fact, in the complexity of contemporary society we can find several promising cases (some of them are still social prototypes, some others have already reached a more mature stage). For instance:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1926-d877-d788-adf3d15854c9\"><em>Circles of care</em></b>:<b> </b>groups of citizen facing the same problem (as: diabetes, allergies, obesity, \u2026 or simply the old age) who mutually support each other, with the supervision of a team of doctors and nurses (a well-known example is the Circle in UK: <a href=\"http://www.participle.net/ageing\">http://www.participle.net/ageing</a> ).</li>\n\n<li>\t<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1926-d877-d788-adf3d15854c9\"><em>Networks of care</em></b><em>:</em><b> </b>coordinated networks of family members, friends and neighbors, who share and coordinate their efforts to care for a person with serious problems (a well-known example is Tyze in Canada <a href=\"http://tyze.com\">http://tyze.com</a> )</li>\n\n<li>\t<em><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1926-d877-d788-adf3d15854c9\">Intergenerational cooperation</b></em>: organizations that supports the encounter of young and elderly people mainly around the theme of collaborative living (a well-known example is Prendi a casa uno studente (Take a student at home), in Italy: <a href=\"http://www.meglio.milano.it/pratiche_studenti.htm\">http://www.meglio.milano.it/pratiche_studenti.htm</a> )</li>\n\n<li>\t<em><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-04231f41-1926-d877-d788-adf3d15854c9\">Collaborative inclusion</b></em><b>: </b>organizations of migrants and residents collaborating to produce both migrant\u2019s inclusion and social values, for both the migrants and the whole community (an example is: \u00a0Dine with us, in Belgium: <a href=\"http://dinewithus.strikingly.com\">http://dinewithus.strikingly.com</a> ) \u00a0\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nConsidering these\u00a0diverse examples, we can observe that they present three common characteristics: (1) some care activities are delivered by non-professional actors; (2) the overall care burden is shared between different subjects; (3) specialized interventions are asked only when they are really needed. \u00a0\n\n<em>These examples are interesting because they give us an idea on how open care components could work.

The overarching logic behind this development and acquisition is generally to enable the provision of public services. In recent decades this model has become overstretched: states have found themselves struggling to find the resources to keep those assets manned so that provision of such services could continue, and had to retreat from many non-core services. Consequently, many such assets lie unused; some are beginning to deteriorate.\n\nIn an effort to correct this situation, some public assets have been turned over to the private sector. This move has had mixed results: while some financial advantages for states have indeed materialized, at least in the short term, many privatization programs suffer unintended consequences. The general consensus seems to be that it might be interesting to explore new avenues.\n\nCommunities have been singled out as candidates for taking care of some public assets, in particular those that can be used to provide services to the community itself.\n\nThere is now evidence available to indicate that communities can indeed provide stewardship. The EdgeRyders community has itself accumulated significant experience in this area. We believe the ability to come together to take care of assets in an unstable context is a key skill for surviving and thriving in the future.</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\n<h1>#LOTE4</h1>\n\n<h2>Stewardship</h2>\n\n<span>23-26 October, 2014\n\nMatera, Italy</span>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\n<img alt=\"image\" height=\"auto\" src=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/lote4/unmonshot.jpg\" width=\"280px\">\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>Detailed program is under construction below.</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-11 18:26:42", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 15:08:10.613592", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 809, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9272, "user_id": 61, "topic_id": 2939, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<span>David,\n\nSorry about this yellow stuff, it won't go away.\n\nI've been waiting for your response to the above.\n\nKei has sent me the sketch of your program for the Kung-fu /Matera Media Project day which extends greatly my suggestion as outlined above.\n\nIt is still do-able, but I'd like your assurances that it won't impede upon our other activities, and that you agree to something akin to my suggestion as to the minimum crew to make things run smoothly.\n\nAs I read the program you are offering an open dinner to everyone (all participants?, the public) at 21:30. \u00a0\n\nOur experience this past week is that our kitchen can effectively manage up to twenty - this has required many active cooks who know the kitchen and with people bringing generously their own contributions.\n\nYour operations needn't be so elaborate - especially if you only use our oven for re-heating (you know the fuse limits).\u00a0 \u00a0However, since you've given indications of 150-300 people, I'd like to get an idea of how you are thinking of solving this before you put out the brochure.\n\n(Did you get the note from Gaia that the Italian isn't up to scratch and that the Month is wrong?)\u00a0\n\nPlease don't print anything until we've agreed.\n\nAs regards the Viral Academy presence at the Map Piccianello activities at the Marketplace - things are falling into line. \u00a0We are still having our regular meeting shortly that you are welcome to come to at 1800. \u00a0If you weren't planning on attending, any written notification would be appreciated as well.\n\nIf the Viral KungFu crowd are still coming, we definitely have use for your mats. \u00a0How heavy are the individual pieces, and do you think three or four of us plus a horde of youngsters could assemble them in the run of half an hour? - I suspect we'll have more than enough helpful hands, but it is best if the kids do it themselves.</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-08 15:32:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:53.381008", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 365, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10126, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4874, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Love this</b>\n\nIt's such a simple idea.

Not for some unknown person in some distant land, either. For friends and family members, people in our communities, right here. Something had to be done.\n\n<strong>We saw people coming together, stepping into the breach.</strong> Communities were taking up the role of care providers, making it work where neither the state nor private business could. They were doing amazing things. Hackers were making open sourced, internet-enabled glucose monitors for children with diabetes. Belgian trauma therapists set up mobile studios and drove them to refugee camps in Greece, to help bereaved refugees. Bipolar 1 patients found and helped each other fight back suicidal tendencies. Biologists and biohackers were trying to invent a cheap, open source process to make insulin. American activists were encouraging each other to eat healthy food and exercise by doing it together.\n\n<strong>We started </strong><strong>a research project</strong><strong>\u00a0to take a good look inside these and many other stories. </strong>We wanted to learn what these initiatives have in common, and how we could make more. That project is called OpenCare; it is now in its second year. Results are still coming through, but one thing is already clear:\n\n<em>It's all about humans.</em>\n\n<strong>Community provision of care services needs humans: \u00a0more, better prepared, volunteers. People prepared to teach each other skills.</strong> \u00a0Therapists to help volunteers in need of trauma support. So, the highest-impact technologies are those that help bring people together. Share knowledge. Distribute human resources across different care contexts. These technologies are connectors: they help string together and coordinate human efforts.\n\n<strong>This intuition is fundamental. It goes even beyond care.</strong> And it makes sense: we are, after all, the 99%. We have little money and power. We have no large companies, fancy foundations, prestigious universities. But we do have each other. We will thrive, if we can collaborate. But there's a problem: collaboration is expensive, and hard to monetise. So, any technology that makes it more efficient is going to make a difference.\n\n<strong>At Edgeryders, we have resolved to put this lesson into practice. We are doing it by hacking the most fundamental connecting technology of all: the home.</strong>\n\n<strong>We dream of a new kind of space, that can be the </strong><strong>hearth</strong><strong> for our families but still be open to the broader world.</strong> Where the door is not a barrier to keep the world out, but a gateway to a global network.<strong> </strong>Where we can live, and work, and sometimes work with the people we live with, and live with our co-workers. Where people are welcome to stay for one day, or a lifetime. Where spending even just an hour in good heart ensures you will never be a stranger again. Where we can develop our talent, learn new skills, get better at what we do. Where we can create for each other a healthy, friendly, cosmopolitan environment and, yes, take care of each other.\n\n<strong>We have dreamt this dream before. In its previous iteration, we called it the unMonastery. </strong>We prototyped in 2014, in the Italian city of Matera. That experience taught us much. We learned that a live/work space can not be too close to the needs of a single client. Neither can it be dependent on the grant cycle. It needs to be financially self-sustaining, and benefit several projects and lines of business. We also learned how important it is to be diverse, open and outward-looking for fresh air and fresh ideas to circulate at all times.\n\nThe unMonastery also got many things right. The most important one is this: we went ahead and tried it. Planning and due diligence are necessary, but trying things out makes for richer learning.\n\nSo, we are not going to keep dreaming about a new space. Instead, <strong>we have decided to roll out </strong><strong><strong>a second</strong></strong><strong> iteration. Right now.\n\nWe are calling it The Reef.</strong>\n\nCoral reefs are structures built by tiny animals, corals. They serve as the home, anchoring point, hiding place, hunting ground to thousands of species. Algae, seaweeds, fish, molluscs all cooperate with, compete with, eat, feed each other. As they do so, they benefit the corals, who gain access to nutrients (reefs exist in nutrient-poor tropical waters).\n\n<strong>Like coral reefs, our new space will draw strength from diversity and symbiosis.</strong> Different people will bring in different skills, access to different networks, different personalities. And Edgeryders itself (a social enterprise, so a creature of a different species) will live in symbiosis with the space and the individuals that live in it. It will pay rent, subsidising those who live there; in return, it will be able to use the space for its own purposes: office, coworking space, venue for small events. We also want to offer some form of access to a broad network of people right from the start.\n\n<strong>We ran the numbers and we are sure we can make it work.</strong>\n\nWe are going to start with a small-scale prototype: a Brussels loft, with four bedrooms, common living area, office, courtyard.\u00a0<a href=\"/u/noemi\">@Noemi</a>\u00a0,\u00a0<a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a>\u00a0and @Alberto are going to be full-time residents; one more room will host temporary residents. We are going live on May 1st 2017, and try it out for one year. We are already looking for a (much) larger space to move into in spring 2018 if the experiment goes well.\n\n<strong>If you are considering being part of the experiment, or curious about learning more, get in touch.</strong> We are planning a \"<a href=\"/t/building-the-reef/6205\">Building the Reef</a>\" track within the \u00a0OpenVillage Festival where we, together, will design the physical space, its financing model, and the activities therein \u2013 from business to fitness and personal development. The track is open to people who, like us, are willing to put some \u201cskin in the game\u201d by becoming founding members.\n\n<strong>Why become a founding member?</strong>\n\nWhat we individually get out of a membership in the Reef is access to\u00a0unique opportunities to develop skills and behaviours needed for living and working well with others. Partner organisations gain access to early stage opportunities for investing in new ventures born out of global network of 3000+ hackers, scientists, social entrepreneurs, artists, activists and more:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Use of our coworking space and guest room (incl. public transport &amp; sim card)</li>\n\n<li>Project development &amp; partnership-building support</li>\n\n<li>Invitation to participate in Skill Development Masterclasses</li>\n\n<li>Invitation to networking dinners, parties,\u00a0and adventures</li>\n\n<li>Full unlimited access passes to our Annual Community Summits (e.g. OpenVIllage Festival)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>What you will learn</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>how to present &amp; sell your ideas</li>\n\n<li>community building and management</li>\n\n<li>mastering\u00a0intercultural communication skills</li>\n\n<li>resolving and limiting damage from conflicts</li>\n\n<li>building practical skills like permaculture, carpentry and plumbing</li>\n\n<li>improving nutrition and physical wellbeing\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>recognising and dealing with common psychosocial problems e.g. depression</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>What each one of us contributes</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>When becoming a member:</strong>\u00a0money to\u00a0cover running costs (for a breakdown of these go here)</li>\n\n<li><strong>While in the house</strong>, as resident and/or visiting: share costs of collective meals\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>On the online community platform:</strong>\u00a0feedback and knowledge to support one another's work</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Our approach towards community and support-building implies trust and a spirit of generosity, rather than transactional relationships.\u00a0</strong>Members are contributors and not service recipients.

The SDG Agenda 2030 has been presented in some news coverage at the microblog social networking service, namely\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com\">Twitter</a><span>. \u00a0Although -- for all of the bureaucratic institution of the United Nations, and the concerns of national missions to the United Nations, among all UN member nations --\u00a0it may not seem to be very much an immediately effective agenda, but I believe that it represents a sense of a unifying principal for humanitarian development, in the world.\u00a0</span>\n\nIt \u00a0may seem that there is typically more coverage about the SDG Agenda 2030, around times when there are meetings of the United Nations in which the Agenda 2030 is being addressed in discussion. I would not wish to discredit the idealists of the United Nations, that it may not seem to be \"Reaching the ground,\" between those few UN meetings. Personally, I think it is a rare and positive kind of agenda, however, an agenda with a uniquely practical manner of focus.\u00a0\n\nThere is a formal document describing the UN Sustainable Development Goals, but it is not a short document, <em><a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\">Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>. </em>In the nomenclature of United Nations publications, the document is titled \"A/RES/70/1\".\u00a0The text is available in a number of languages:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=A\">A/RES/70/1 in <em>Arabic</em></a>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=C\">A/RES/70/1 in <em>Chinese</em></a>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E\">A/RES/70/1 in <em>English</em></a>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=F\">A/RES/70/1 in <em>French</em></a>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=R\">A/RES/70/1 in <em>Russian</em></a>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/70/L.1&amp;Lang=S\">A/RES/70/1 in <em>Spanish</em></a>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThere are a total of 17 formal goals of the 2030 Agenda -- the text of the goals, focusing on topics such as for ending poverty, promoting gender equality, addressing social concerns with regards to estimates of global climate theory, and promoting health and education. Perhaps the Sustainable Development Goals may seem to provide an ideal number of topics for focus in discussions, if not moreover o provide a manner of ideal direction as with regards to sustainable innovations in real world developments.\u00a0\n\nIn the interest of following the news about the \\#2030agenda, personally I created a <em>Twitter list,\u00a0</em>as it being a list primarily of Twitter channels created by UN member institutions. The list is titled <em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/spchamp/lists/post2015\">post2015</a></em>. Although it may not be a \"Complete\" list of UN member institutions, but I believe that it may serve to present much of the news in the ongoing progress of the development of the UN sustainable development goals.\n\nThe SDG Agenda 2030 has been denoted at Twitter with a various number of \"#hashTags\", in social networking over time. The first such <em>hash tag</em> by which I had seen it denoted with, at Twitter, it was the \"#post2015\" tag. Later, there was the \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/agenda2030\">#agenda2030</a>\" tag, more recently the \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/2030agenda\">#2030agenda</a>\" tag.\u00a0The \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShareHumanity\">#shareHumanity</a>\" tag has also found some application, at Twitter, sometimes in a context of the SDG Agenda 2030 and otherwise as with regards to humanitarian concerns, broadly in news of world events.\n\nIn order to develop an approach for development, such that may be established in addressing a set of common goals, I believe that the UN SDG Agenda 2030 is \"The best thing going.\" Perhaps the United Nations, as an institution, may seem to exist as an institution largely independent of individual national, commercial,\u00a0political, religious, and ethnic concerns, as the UN representing a forum established for civil society.\u00a0\n\nOf course, the Agenda 2030 is so broad that it may be difficult to illustrate for how it may relate singularly to any specific, practical, \"Real world\" projects. Personally, I would not want to suggest as though the United Nations was all of only a bureaucratic institution, though I understand that much of the proceedings of the UN occur at a pace of a slow-going bureaucracy. I understand that the <em>Humanitarian Clusters </em>of the UN are making a definite progress in the real world.\u00a0\n\nPersonally, I am of an impression that <em>Communication</em> is one of the most important resources in humanitarian development -- communication, in any single kind of media, whether of the Internet, of print publications, of radio news, or otherwise communications. Though I think it is not easy to find an opportunity to develop a project outside of the global commerce of commercial enterprise, I am certain that it is \"Where the future is developed,\" all of the world outside of the \"Enterprise Silo.\"\n\nPersonally, I hope that Edgeryders may ever be more formally a part of developing in a context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Even if without any formal association, though, I think this is a cheerful forum for communication.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-19 10:30:16", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 08:15:28.165305", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1039, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 26.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4056], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5229, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5196, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<em>This is a wiki.

What's going to happen?</h2>\n\n<a href=\"/u/thomas_goorden\">@Thomas Goorden</a>\u00a0will be leading an experiential, experimental\u00a0and intensive workshop loosely based on Joe Edelman's \"<a href=\"https://quip.com/kc4jAKO83gUD\">Hyperactive Listening</a>\" format, sprinkled with a dash of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_Intensive\">Enlightenment Intensive</a>\" (the ultra-light version) and punctuated with an intentional walk.\n\nYou can participate as either \"<strong>Story</strong>\" or as \"<strong>Co-counsellor</strong>\":\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Story/project</h3>\n\nYour \"story\" (a\u00a0project, idea or problem)\u00a0will become the center of an investigative group exercise. The messier your \"story\", the better the workshop will be. Perhaps you are working on a project, but aren't really sure what it is or have difficulty explaining it to people? Perhaps you are stuck in some kind of dilemma or conflict that you find difficult to get past?\n\n<strong>Perfect.</strong>\u00a0We will take a significant amount of time to figure out what is going on and help you get on your way (again).\n\nThe outcome of the workshop (for you) could be text, diagrams, video and pictures that you can use to explain your story when those questions come up once more. But most importantly, some fundamental insight into your own story.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">Co-counsellor</h3>\n\nA good co-counsellor is in the first place someone who can\u00a0<em>listen</em>\u00a0to someone's story (even if it is your own). You'll then get to ask questions, investigate, analyse, try to distil the essence of a story, receive feedback and start from the beginning again. Until we get it \"right\".\n\nYou'll learn and practice all sorts of skills valuable for telling your own stories when they need it. And of course you will discover all sorts of projects other people are working on. But mostly, you will have the deep satisfaction of having been able to help someone.\n\n<span>Please note that part of the format will relate directly to discovering</span><span>\u00a0who\u00a0</span><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19.200000762939453px; line-height: 26.112003326416016px;\">you</em><span>\u00a0are, so you may expect some personal insights as co-counsellor as well.</span>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">B. Registration</h2>\n\nThe workshop can normally only accommodate a maximum of 8 people, of which 3 people can bring a story. Should there be a lot more interest, we'll try to figure out how to handle it. Please indicate in the comments if you would like to bring a \"story\".\n\nDate: 2016-02-28 13:00:00 - 2016-02-28 17:00:00, Europe/Brussels Time.", "created_at": "2016-02-15 10:53:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:30.679439", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 636, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3025, 2569, 1543], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7696, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2311, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>updated status: Done</b>\n\n.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-27 17:43:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:44.887062", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33203, "user_id": 3187, "topic_id": 4974, "post_number": 68, "raw": "<b>I'd love to come!</b>\n\nI'm a student in Leuven and am really interested in all dimensions of the reception and integration of refugees.

Es hat alle unsere Erwartungen \u00fcberschritten, da wir nicht nur \u00fcber Prekariat, soziale Ekslusion und Armut diskutiert haben, sondern auch dar\u00fcber, wie Regierungen uns allen und besonders jungen Leuten, in dieser Krise helfen k\u00f6nnen.\n\nDieses Mal haben unsere Aktionen mit Edgeryders 2 einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Umfang und ein neues Mandat: den Aufbau eines europ\u00e4ischen Aktionsnetzwerks f\u00fcr die Unterst\u00fctzung lokaler Projekte, die wirklich etwas bewegen!\n\nDeine erste Chance um bei diesem Aktionsnetzwerk mitzumachen ist am 6-9 Dezember in Bruxelles.\n\nDU MUSST DEIN TRANSPORT JETZT ORGANISIEREN!\n\nWir k\u00f6nnen deine Reisekosten leider nicht finanzieren, aber wenn du jetzt einen Ticket reservierst kannst du von den meisten L\u00e4ndern in Europa einen Ticket hin und zur\u00fcck f\u00fcr unter 100EUR, und auch h\u00e4ufig Tickets f\u00fcr unter 50EUR finden.

Aber wenn du weisst, dass du mitmachen m\u00f6chtest, buche jetzt deine Reise, w\u00e4hrend es noch g\u00fcnstig ist. Viele Edgeryders 2 Leute werden sehr viel reisen \u2013 ein Netzwerk ist nur so stark wie seine Gelenke \u2013 also gew\u00f6hn' dich daran im Voraus zu buchen.\n\nAlso, was werden wir eigentlich bei Edgeryders 2 machen?\n\nDie sinnvolle Antwort lautet: das h\u00e4ngt von dir ab! Der Europarat h\u00e4tte gern, dass wir uns auf drei Bereiche konzentrieren:\n\n* Unterst\u00fctzung, Fortschritt und Erfolg f\u00fcr lokale Initiativen und das beinhaltet auch die M\u00f6glichkeit neue Projekte an neuen Orten zu beginnen.\n\n* Wie kann man vom Anfang an Netzwerke und europ\u00e4ische Zusammenarbeit nutzen, um Ver\u00e4nderung zu schaffen?\n\n* Fokus auf eine politische Implementierung von dem, was wir in Edgeryders 1 gelernt haben\n\nWas wir sehen wollen sind ein paar dutzend Projekt Teams in verschiedensten Bereichen, quer durch Kulturen und L\u00e4nder, die alle an ihren spezifischen lokalen Agendas arbeiten. Sie kooperieren mit anderen, um effektiver zu sein, um Ressourcen zu teilen und wollen damit Aufsehen erregen, um die Art und Weise, wie die Politik uns dient und Dienstleistungen zur Verf\u00fcgung stellt, dauerhaft zu ver\u00e4ndern.\n\nUnsere Ziel ist es, eine kraftvolle, tiefgr\u00fcndige, nachhaltige Innovation \u00fcberall in der Welt zu schaffen.\n\nUnser Budget ist gering, aber wir haben ein Kern-Team, dass mit der Hilfe des Europarats T\u00fcre \u00f6ffnen kann, um Kontakt mit lokalen Beh\u00f6rden zu etablieren. Und wir haben euch: herausragende Talente mit wertvollen Wissen, so dass selbst die Fortune 500 Unternehmen uns nicht das Wasser reichen k\u00f6nnen.\n\nAlso, lasst uns die Party beginnen!\n\n1.

Lately i walked more than 25 kilometers in one day.\n\nNext steps are <a href=\"http://stages-survie-ceets.org/stages-survie-calendrier/\">survival stages</a> (220-300\u20ac), raids that are quite cheap, you just need equipment, maps, and enough food and water.\n\nThe idea is to enstrenght the body and soul step by step without forcing too much.\n\n\u00a0\n\nConcerning equipment cost, i already have a few things, and each month, I invest depending on my budget.\n\nTo equip myself, i take a lot of inspiration from Vol West, he made a series of videos about <a href=\"http://lesurvivaliste.blogspot.fr/2012/05/le-sac-devacuation-conclusion.html\">evacuation bag</a>.\n\nAs i'm not fully equiped i can't tell what it will be at the end, but i can tell what i bought last month.\n\nI mostly buy from decathlon, it's cheap and good equipment.\n\nSleeping bag (40\u20ac), hiking towel (10\u20ac), hiking shoes as i just destroyed my old shoes (130\u20ac).\n\nI also invested on hygiene and health (soap, etc).\n\n\u00a0\n\nI invest little by little, depending on my needs and my budget. I already intend to make a full inventory when it will be self sufficient. Maybe in a few months.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI don't know much about community farms or urban farms, but there are <a href=\"http://www.reseaucocagne.asso.fr/\">jardins de cocagne</a> in my town.\n\nThey produce a wide variety of bio vegetables, every week you get a basket with some cooking advices. My parents have used this to get vegetables for years and it was pretty cool. Every week season vegetables, and often uncommon ones. It's local, cheap, and one more thing, the jardins de cocagne are a reintegration center. So the workers are oftenly long time unemployed people, or suffering people.\n\nBio, local and humanist !\n\n\u00a0\n\nI also have some interest about indoor gardening.\n\nActually, we plan to try indoor permaculture on our open university project to get a self sufficient indoor eco-system in case of urban integration. Can't say much more about it, i need to make some stages to learn permaculture, and try it before i can tell more about it, but it could be a mix of technology and permaculture technics, maybe using a bit of hydroponic systems, it will depend on the place, the budget...\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-02 11:41:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:19.953472", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 517, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19064], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23830, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2636, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Finished caring for commons Mission Brief</b>\n\n/t/spot-the-future-caring-for-commons/559\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-03 09:59:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:12.221148", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 34, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-07-08 23:46:14.710155", "updated_at": "2017-07-12 18:11:50.322570", "deleted_at": "2017-07-12 20:32:43.925452", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14823, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3091, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Humbled</b>\n\n@Ben, I intentionally postponed reacting to this post because it takes a rested eye (not that 11pm is the best time :))\u00a0\n\nThanks a ton for this thorough update, it is so rich one can hardly try an articulate feedback.\n\n<strong>I am amazed at the wealth of knowledge that you guys produced in less than 4 months!</strong>\u00a0and feel a bit at a loss in terms of the little that surfaced throughout in terms of milestones achieved (some like Marc's seem quite well packaged for outreach)- bits here and there, proof that so many things were progressing at the same time, which in itself it's not bad. It also depends on where one looks - and I obviously look through ER horizons which some have rightly pointed out is far from THE channel or YOUR own channel (you meaning the unMonasterians). But I think it is why it feels harder for some of us working on different projects (eg futurespotters) to make connections and seed collaboration.

Where did some of my personal expectations fail to be met?</span></span>\n\nI became involved with LOTE5 because i was interested in learning more about the people behind the network. I also wanted a reason to reach further into the Edgeryders platform which i had previously only scratched the surface. I immediately signed on to the food team because i knew that was an area i understood, could be of immediate benefit to, and would guarantee me a series of\u00a0tasks and a ready made group of people that i could talk to. I wasn't disappointed. I actually found it a very quick and easy way into the understanding what the whole of LOTE would be like. There had obviously been a lot of hard work and effort gone into making sure we had a space, equipment and the correct ingredients but a slight disconnect between the preparation team and the delivery team (perhaps this is an analogy for the whole\u00a0weekend). My assumption (like Quinn) was that was intentionally built into the weekend and so i carried that assumption through the weekend with me (Alex)\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>===========</span></span>\n\n<span><span>Story 4: How I became involved with LOTE5?

What I seen as the main difference was that this one was more open to newcomers. But each has different expectations. It was not clear what was going on. LOTE4 was about unMonastery, not Edgeryders - people were mostly communicating through the platform; if we look at interactions online we may be able to see that. I think some people were lost till the very end day. | </span></span><span><span>Mostly the onsite stuff I agree with - it needs a bit more centralized info point. </span></span><span><span>I\u2019m guessing the sessions online weren\u2019t promoted too much, maybe because they weren\u2019t rich in information. | Have an onsite problem solving team; eg Quinn is responsible for keeping the time, but only for one day.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Your two pillars are the grid and the culture.</span></span>\n\n<ol style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\n\n<li>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span><span>Grid: architecturally speaking, we can only have open events - micromanaged events take too many resources and we don\u2019t have them. Open events don\u2019t have to be chaotic - you have a grid before and the freedom is in filling in the grid. Eg you have a long coffee break in the morning for sessions that are late. Coffee breaks are a good redundancy.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span><span>Culture: the shared culture - in previous events (a little smaller) we had the online channel of onboarding that worked in a comprehensive way. In this case we had an influx of people that were not onboarded. People imitate what others do - if you are in a room where people don\u2019t wash their teacups, they assume it\u2019s how it\u2019s done and won\u2019t clean. (Alberto)</span></span>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nI think Hazem's idea above (info team) is a very good one. I come from an events organisation background and so i know that people need to be reminded of the basics (or the things that we find 'culturally' acceptable/unacceptable in each environment) If people aren't explicitly told to 'turn off your phone' or 'turn on your phone, take pictures and tweet them' then they don't know what to do and they default to what they would normally do 'at home'. This needs to be explained regularly, at the beginnings and ends of sessions/days/events\u00a0to catch everyone.\n\nI think even if you had a rotating team of people who were easily identifiable as 'helpers' or 'problem solvers' for each day that would help if you have a lot of new members (like myself) or you have interested locals who have stumbled onto us, or are there to meet one specific person.\n\nI also think that people don't like hierarchy when it comes to setting agendas, or controlling conversations etc, but they love it when it comes to cleaning toilets. I think that people would overlook a more centralised structure within the organisation if it was clear that it was in order to ensure these basic areas of hygiene\u00a0are covered for them.

We didn\u2019t even have a stub of a program when we started fundraising in October - which is 4 months before the actual event. This is a challenge - you want to have the program shaped by participants, but you also need something concrete to show to potential funders. Solution: need a high level program when we start organising an event (fail contributed by Noemi)</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>A speaker\u2019s flight shouldn\u2019t have been sponsored when said speaker is resourceful and the expectation to prepare more isn\u2019t made clear. Working closer with speakers to make sure they don\u2019t do lectures, but more like workshops (Kira)</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>On the first day we were adamant on arriving on time, saw people being late, and by the end of it we weren\u2019t coming on time (Quinn)</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Starting at 9:30 is too early, by all cultural norms apparently when you have this much diversity. There is a built in element of delay, and you have to design for it (Alberto, Noemi agrees)</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\nSuggestion: start each day with a short keynote speech (15mins) that can happen over coffee and happens in a communal area. John's keynote was the lens through which i viewed everything at LOTE5 and i found that a really useful start to the Friday conference. I'm sure if i had another on on Saturday from someone else i would have really appreciated that too. Sometimes it's nice to start the day with someone talking to you and not having to respond.\n\nThis would draw peoples attention at the beginning of the day, encourage them to arrive on time and also allow you a chance to introduce the 'support team' for the day in person/explain the ground rules for the day and generally cohere everyone together. Think of it as the opposite of the end of day feedback and sharing plenary. (Alex)\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><a href=\"/t/food-team/4960\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Food team</span></a></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>While this was the perfect and best example of how you can coordinate online in advance to assemble a team, we failed at ensuring that responsibility in the team was shared equally - having one or two people slaving in the kitchen and missing out on sessions is not OK.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\nFood = mess. For every person on the food team there needs to be someone on the cleaning team. Anywhere that we cook needs to also have the correct facilities to clean and wash afterward too.\n\nIt's inevitable that people involved in these areas will have to miss sessions before or after lunch. There needs to be a way of balancing this loss, either by making up for it in another way, or by mitigating it. (personal note - as one of the people who was in the kitchen a lot i never felt left out, unappreciated or unhappy with my situation - kitchens attract people who like being in them. I would be really interested to see what happens next with the idea of FoodOnTheEdge - i think we could run a mini conference strand that took place in the kitchen next time and operated as a cross between a normal session and the disco\u00a0soupe model) (Alex)\n\n<span><a href=\"/t/venue-travels-and-accommodation-team/4956\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Logistics: venue, travels and accommodation team</span></a></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Brussels Art Factory didnt give us any instructions for keeping the space \u201cthis is how to handle it\u201d; it is an easy thing to do. If someone gives us the venue, I didn\u2019t stop to think that it means taking someone\u2019s time in full, that you are asking for the people\u2019s time who are behind the space (Kira)</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>EWB also has a national conference annually; while the chairs of the conference were paid, but most organizers weren\u2019t - mostly student chapters. Normally people would be excited about an event planning volunteering opportunity. The idea of collaborating for conference tickets is great.

The coffee area, and the events space(souk?) were lovely areas to meet and relax, but they were too far away from the front entrance. This meant that new people were already lost by the time they found us &amp;\u00a0it made having a front desk for information difficult and Kira and Irene had to keep running off to open the door (Alex)\n\n<span><a href=\"/t/documenting-lote5-call-for-fail-unfail-reporters/5211\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span>Documenting LOTE5 - call for \\#fail \\#unfail reporters</span></a></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2 style=\"list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 21.3333px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline;line-height:1.38;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;\"><span><span>3.

You can in case put on the boxes my name (Natalia Skoczylas) and the name of Sunoj Shreshta, and send me confirmation that something has been sent and when it is expected to come. Airport is very close, I can come pick it up. And a lot of it gets stuck in the airports. Things needed are tents, water filters,medicine, blankets, torches, solar batteries, chargers, and people: medical care, rescue specialists, specialists who can evaluate if the building is liable or not.\n\n<div class=\"text_exposed_show\">\n\n2. Send money and things to this address - this is not a scam, but people i know and started working with, they're right now in one of the affected villages. Also, most probably, we together will be leaving for a mission to another small town in Nepal this week by jeep - and this requires some funds.

It looks that I overslept quite a lot of smaller earthquakes these days, which is a good sign:) There is a great spirit here, people help each other, smile a lot, keep the sense of humor and try their best to help. There is\u00a0 plenty of food in shops (this doesn't help much those who are left with no home and money outside, though), and the biggest problem is that most of the shopkeepers are scared to re-open due to the bad state of the buildings. There is also a campaign to change it. Bad news is that maybe the shaking is not over yet, and it rains quite a bit since two days, and soon this all might lead to a spread of diseases. So far let's be optimistic. I gained a lot of strength from the last four days - it feels like I've been here forever, though. I will write something bigger soon.\n\n</div>", "created_at": "2015-04-28 11:59:39", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 14:25:10.200844", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 552, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 810.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2717, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2684, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Yesterday evening, Daniel, Dorotea and I had one of those calls. You know where you give yourself time to reflect on what it is you and others really enjoy and want to do, and go on to identify how you can go about doing it together. Including how you could work out the practical bits like making the work economically self-sustaining so everyone is paid and no one is burning out. \u00a0\n\nWe brushed on several different topics starting with how we each prefer to work, what we like and what we want to do differently now that everyone has has time to get a feel for how things happen in Edgeryders. This post presents them one by one and ends with a list of what we have agreed to do, where and how.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Storytelling for valuable participation</strong>\n\nOne of the priorities of the Agency is to develop the storytelling around Edgeryders company, and the topics of interest in the community to an external audience for whom a lot of the things we discuss are new. Some of this is done in a centralised way e.g preparing a standard presentation that anyone can use in pitching their ideas to others whom they want to engage in an initiative in or through Edgeryders. Most of it is decentralised: helping Edgeryders community members get better at communicating the themes or issues they care about in a way that makes them accessible and engaging for the world at large. This is done by preparing a guide for storytelling as well as processes for members to help one another develop posts, articles, project presentations and calls for participation.\n\n<strong>Developing Living on the Edge events into sustainable conversations</strong>\n\nWe want to develop the LOTE format so that it is even better, engages more people and carries itself money-wise. We are not interested in dog and pony show formats with one person talking, but events as shared learning journeys where you come together and figure things out with peers from different walks of life. The way we see them unfolding are as longer conversations around topics that matter betwen people who are\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Interested in the field\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Interested in developing their own ideas</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nEdgeryders role in this is to make the conversations technically possible, building and maintaining diverse communities around the topics as well as driving collaborative prototyping of the ideas that come out of the conversations. A solid model is one which allows conversations to be hosted by individuals who are very knowledgeable about the area, but does not play into the digital sharecropping prevalent online e,g, Huffpo.\n\n<strong>Managing information load and time/energy costs of coordinating a distributed team</strong>\n\nWhen discussions get going on Edgeryders, they REALLY get going. This means lots of notifications in your inbox which can be overwhelming if you haven't adjusted the notification settings in <a href=\"/user\">your profile</a>. \u00a0The other issue we discussed was how to allocate the 2000USD available for the Agency. The agreement was to put it aside to pay for the Agency to meet or for other expenses if needed. Basically we just earmark it for later.\n\n<strong>Daniel:</strong>\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>is up for tasks that are focused and require 4 hour bursts every now and then- not the day to day management of Edgeryders social media presence, or interaction in the platform.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>is taking charge of producing a presentation of the Edgeryders company that tells the story of what it offers prospective clients in a convincing way that positions it well.</li>\n\n<li>Possibly connecting it to relevant/right prospective partners/clients.</li>\n\n<li>he would like to develop the lote event format into something sharp that will also be economically viable together with Dorotea</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Dorotea:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Is up for more regular basis work with the aim of helping Edgeryders get better at storytelling to an external audience around topics that are of interest/ within areas of specialisation of community members.</li>\n\n<li>feels Edgeryders are predominantly good at discussing with each other: Some work needs to be done to help community members develop their stories for people who do not understand the topics so well.</li>\n\n<li>would like to try things like produce a\u00a0guide for storybuilding, or one on one story development help.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>would like to drive the work of Making Lote4 happen.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Said:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Is implementing the social media plan he proposed and will have little time for anything else over the next three months</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Nadia:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Is doing the coordination, ensuring everyone is participating in ways that work for them and supporting everyone however she can in her capacity as CEO of Edgeryders LBG.</li>\n\n<li>Prefers communication in writing on the Edgeryders platform or email.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>What we are doing ahead of the next hangout</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Set up permanent skype chat channel for the Agency group, for more fluid and restricted communication off platform\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Build presentation of Edgeryders company\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Prepare list of links to possible topics to explore further for \\#lote4\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>", "created_at": "2014-04-07 18:18:56", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:14.298589", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 924, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16662, "user_id": 2566, "topic_id": 4598, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Amazing, very straight to the point.\n\nI assume that Mamoun does this on the side, as in he has a primary job/line of work?\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/u/driss\" style=\"font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\">@Driss</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-28 06:07:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.216847", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 47, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4284, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4251, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<i>Below is a kind of \"checklist\" of key things to include in our proposal aggregated from various sources.

Eventually, this extended awareness can also be a tool to support experimentation and implementation of new social and economic models [35] (e.g., social currencies based on social reputation, distributed P2P finance, microfinancing, etc.). </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Increase citizen\u2019s confidence and trust in statistics, forecasts, simulations, and scenarios</span><span> by reconciling data from official and unofficial sources [36]. </span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span>Enable more accurate predictions of social, economic or environmental trends</span><span> based on feeding data, contributed by distributed human and environmental sources, into complex integrated ecological, social, and economic models including feedback loops, thus bringing them to the level of sophistication of weather and climate modeling.

The \"what's in it for me\" question is, as\u00a0always, the central one of engagement.\n\nYour list of use cases is, as far as I can see, fundamentally splittable into two parts.\n\nOn case 1, I have no answer. Your experience is much deeper than that of any of us in the consortium. If <em>you</em>\u00a0can't solve it, no one can. Zoe is almost certainly in the worldwide top 10 experts on this issue.\u00a0We go back to the Commission and say \"not happening.

I have done my best to share this experience with you all, many times, but it seems it is so counterintuitive that you cannot bring yourselves to try it :-) I think this is why Guy finds this conversation theoretical: practices that (sort of) work are already there, generating the data for this\u00a0project, in exactly this context.

However, we propose that, in practice, most of the attention and resources of people and organizations wishing to convene smart communities are concentrated solely on ICT artefacts.

Very much related to resilience, which is were it looks like I'll be helping out next: <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/resilience-session\">the Resilience session</a>.\n\nWhat I've been doing I can't talk much about yet. Imagine a severe crisis, a global systemic one like the worst you've thought, and then it rains (or doesn't, whatever's worst). How do you react to that? No planning is possible, and if it's possible, it is never done in practice. So you must forget about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop\">RoboCop</a> option, which is about arming yourself with expensive, specific, fancy, and heavy tools. You're left with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver\">MacGyver</a> approach, which is about looking at your needs, then looking at your haves, and using your ingenuity and skills to hack your way out as safely and quickly as possible.\n\nSo, yes, I've been looking at resilience but I haven't had the energy to catch up on EdgeRyders, shame on me! You can help me by pointing out the must-reads about the subject, both at <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaign/resilience\">the campaign</a> and <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/search/node/resilience\">looking for the word across the full site</a>. Or at other sources you find important. Thanks in advance!\n\nAlso, I know roughly what the session will look like. Say there's a hundred of us on that Friday morning, and six sessions. That means maybe 17 people (a sixth of the hundred total) - or of course more or less than that - will get together in a room, for 2.5 hours, with the aim of looking into <strong>issues perceived by Europe\u2019s youth as important and what young entrepreneurs, activists and innovators are doing to tackle them</strong> ... <strong>bringing in their own experience and vision</strong> ... all about \"resilience\" <strong>as a key element of the transition of young people to an independent active life</strong>.\n\nAfter that, <strong>each workshop will be giving a 5 minutes (3 slides) report to the plenary</strong> ... to<strong> bring to the plenary an actionable idea, not just general principles</strong>. This means that <strong>preparing well in advance, coordinating with other team members, will be a key to success</strong>. Our kind hosts say they <strong>will probably hold a competition between breakout sessions, so make sure your team wins!</strong> Those 3 slides, is suggested, would have this content:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong><font face=\"Arial\">What is an important challenge identified</font></strong></li>\n\n<li><strong><font face=\"Arial\">Who are the stakeholders in ensuring that the challenge is resolved and their relationships to each other and the challenge</font></strong></li>\n\n<li><strong><font face=\"Arial\">A creative solution for how to solve the challenge and get stakeholders on board to help make it happen</font></strong></li>\n\n</ol>I'm sure we can build good stuff. You know, because we're motivated, and because 17 (+/-) people in 2.5 hours is <em>huge</em> brain power.\n\nIn fact, if we're lucky to be so many, we might even want to split up for brief sprints, or whatever works.\n\nIn any case, I'll be thinking about how I can help to make the most of this, and I'd appreciate your help.\n\nAgain, thanks in advance, and - gasp - see ya there!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-16 16:32:44", "updated_at": "2018-02-09 07:41:58.504624", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 668, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 76.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31144, "user_id": 932, "topic_id": 2859, "post_number": 48, "raw": "yep I'm checking the network now and It still misbehaves when dragging the slider, I'll have to dig deeper tomorrow morning (but we're close now :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-04 17:44:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:51.371102", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31141], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6711, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1970, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>posted it on lanyrd just incase </b>\n\n<a href=\"http://lanyrd.com/2013/unmon/\">Here</a>\n\nI know, lanyrd is for online and offline confs, but why not posting a twitter conf too.

He is also involved in the organisation of a community food growing project in the city.\n\nThis example I find particularly heartening as he not only produces most of his food but he shares his skills and knowledge via the community food project.\u00a0 This project engages with schools and adults with learning difficulties and via these activities he earns a living - well that part of it that he does not grow :)\n\nOf course land is scarse and in demand around cities, which makes it more difficult to find a piece suitable for growing.\u00a0 Which in turn increases the probability that you would have to travel further to get to your growing space with the additional travelling time increasing the efforts that have to be expended.\n\nThe classic example, much loved by the Transition Towns movement is of Cuba - the film 'The Power of Community' (which I've sadly yet to see) details how Cuba had to drastically increase food production after the Soviet Union split and Cuba lost the massive food and oil supplies that had been sent.\u00a0\u00a0 The film apparently paints a somewhat rosey picture, but with massive state support domestic food production increased dramatically ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Period ) .\u00a0 People grew much more in the city - being creative with their use of space.\u00a0 Also movement from the cities back to the land was facilitiated.\n\nThere does appear to be a growing interest in food growing, I certainly see it here in the UK.\u00a0 There is much on television, a massive demand for allotments (which are sadly massively under supplied - particularly in cities) and for the first time since WW2 vegetable seed sales have recently out stripped flower seed sales.\u00a0 The planning system combined with the property and vegetable markets make it extremely difficult for new enterants to move into food production. \u00a0 There is a big financial outlay (and probably debt - which will require servicing) to aquire and gear up for production.\u00a0 Then a new entrant needs to have the growing skills and all the skills to keep their new business afloat and market their produce in a market with extrememly competative pricing.\u00a0 Its a tough start going it alone - which is one of the reasons I like the idea of food production which is a community enterprise - supported by, and in the service of a community.\n\nAlthough many more self sufficient people, growing much of their own food would, in many ways, be a good thing, I dont find the thought amazingly attractive.\u00a0 I think much that is wrong in the world is due to the fact that people have become more and more insular.\u00a0 I think that food is a good way to bring people back together.\u00a0 At the community food projects where I volunteer I meet all kinds of people who I would never noramlly meet, let alone get to know.\u00a0 The sharing of food (at all the projects food is prepareed and shared) and labour creates friendships.\n\n<u>Benefits of a more resilient food production</u>\n\nI've covered some of this already,\u00a0 I'm going to outline benefits under a more resilient food system based upon the model I've tried to describe, although I think any resilient food system would share many characteristics.\n\nto throw up a quick list -\n\nFor community -\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>increased resilience to supply chain disruptions (possibly due to financial or energy disruptions)</li>\n\n<li>increased community 'strength' (greater community bonds)</li>\n\n<li>reduced imports (more wealth kept in community)</li>\n\n<li>less food transportation (pollution, congestion, energy)</li>\n\n<li>reduced energy consumption (fetilizer/peticide production, tractors)</li>\n\n</ul>For individuals -\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>increased resilience (not totally reliant on a job to put food on the table)</li>\n\n<li>increased mental and physical wellbeing (working the soil, being in fresh air, collaborating and socialising with others, eating fresh vegetables, supporting yourself)</li>\n\n<li>greater understanding of the resources required for, and the impact of, the production of your food</li>\n\n</ul>\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-30 11:12:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:39.199025", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 807, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19290, "user_id": 3559, "topic_id": 4834, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Nice Title Bem</b>\n\n.", "created_at": "2015-11-13 23:22:00", "updated_at": "2017-09-10 23:18:13.721266", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14639], "is_liked_by": [2580], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16786, "user_id": 2470, "topic_id": 5953, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>The meeting</b>\n\nTino\u00a0will represent EHFF in Milan.

Help members of this community and others to liberate ourselves by replacing the proprietary tools we use with free software alternatives and finding ways to drive support to the free software community as a natural part of our work with clients, other partners etc.\n\nStarting with setting up an alternative to google drive for secure storage of files and collaborative editing of documents.\u00a0\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\">Exploring our option - Centralised vs. Distributed</h2>\n\nCentralised is more versatile because having a single point of contact allows people to do things like collaborate on shared files. Think of it as renting space in one computer managed by either a person or organisation. The options we are exploring are: <a href=\"https://owncloud.org/\">Owncloud</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rollapp.com/\">Rollapp</a>.\n\n<strong>Distributed is more collaborative and resilient</strong> because your files are broken up into smaller chunks, encrypted and spread throughout a network of thousands of computers with spare storage space. Think of it like renting a little space on people's hard drives. The options we are exploring are: <a href=\"https://www.tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs\">Tahoe-Lafs</a>, <a href=\"http://maidsafe.net/\">MaidSafe</a> (not released yet), <a href=\"http://www.symform.com/\">Symform</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.getsync.com/\">BitTorrent Sync</a>...\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/-T_uV2giecI\n\nWith BitTorrent Sync we can set things up so that everyone who is signed up on edgeryders (and signed in) we can set up a secure network so that only people in the community are accessing our files. And maybe even offer secure file hosting for community members concerned about their privacy and risk of loosing ones materials should any of the proprietary services we all use go down.\n\nWhat do you think, any other options we should check out?\n\nWe'll ensure that any software we decide to use is free and we will audit it. So now's your chance to propose something you are interested in but unsure about.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-13 11:37:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:26.468197", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 649, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 171.4, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 2551, 2580, 2787, 2334, 2747, 1856, 5083], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24176, "user_id": 83, "topic_id": 1449, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>My ride with local food</b>\n\n\"1) A permaculturist once asked me: \"why don't <strong>you</strong> grow food?\". That one is easy. \"I don't know how to. I don't have land. I don't have time. I make money doing things I know and that pays for the food others grow.\" Also, I took a short course on ecological agriculture, but it clearly didn't break my current reality: I'd rather do other things.\"\n\nWow! That leaps out at me!\n\n\"I feel really silly suggesting other people might farm when I clearly won't do it myself.\"\n\nHmm, hard not to be offensive here, but I think that is pretty silly.\n\nI've got a multitude of pressures on my time (though I wouldn't presume they are comparable with yours). An allotment might not be a farm but it's taught me more in 5 years of amatuerish gardening than any amount of data and reading journals ever could, I'm pretty sure.\n\nYour answers sound like the textbook explanation for how 'civilisation' (I'd prefer to be more radical and say 'hierarchy') emerged from agriculture - when the many can grow food for an elite few, suddenly things change. New possibilities emerge, more time for culture, invention, etc, but also the development of a stratified society - where a lucky few rely on the toil of others.\n\nI don't think this will last if food security becomes the issue I think it will be - at least, I'd rather it didn't, because if it does, it will be backed up with violence (I think we see the beginnings of this in gated communities and Israel's Wall claiming land and water)\n\nI've also seen - and screened - the Cuba film, and are glad that the same part prickled you as me - of course these people developed interesting community food systems - THEY WERE STARVING! Necessity is the mother of invention... similar things appear to be happening now in Greece, and allotments in the UK were originally to help working class people continue to survive in the exploitation of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nI've posted elsewhere about the Transition Stroud 'Edible Open Gardens' project, to inspire people to grow their own food, and to grow more of it, and to grow - and share - with others (http://www.transitionstroud.org/wpedibleopengardens/). We have also started an annual Potato Day in February - where we sell over 20 varieties of seed potato in the local shopping centre, encouraging people to use this as a first crop (after all, you can grow potatoes in anything, and they help clear ground for other crops) - and celebrate the humble spud! Then there's Apple Day in October, which has developed into the 'Apple Town' project to maintain, publicise and plant orchards of apples and other productive trees in and around the town. A related local group has a Get Growing project in the local primary schools, which through collaboration with students growing food at their schools produced a recipe book last year. We've also started a Local Food Strategy group, including a few farmers - trying to reach more - which aims to develop the back of the envelope calculations estimating whether Stroud could feed itself, done a few years ago: http://community.stroud.gov.uk/_documents/34_Food_Availability_in_Stroud_District.pdf\n\nI hope those links, and the references in that last one, help you - and make up for any initial offensiveness on my part! What you've done sounds great too, and I look forward to getting a better look at the links you provided. The last thing I'd mention is diet - have you considered this? If you haven't read it before, I'd start with Simon Fairlie (a committed meat-eater and farmer)'s article Can Britian Feed Itself (the basis for the Stroud version above) http://www.thelandmagazine.org.uk/articles/can-britain-feed-itself, and then - again, if you haven't read already, move on to his book \"Meat: A Benign Extravagance\" (see, told you he was committed), and compare and contrast with the less theoretical, more practical 'Growing Green' by Iain Tolhurst and Jenny Hall http://www.goveganic.net/spip.php?article20. You might also like the international magazine of the same name, which reports on projects around the world - and hence surely with some microclimates similar to those near you, and the videos on the above site.\n\nI look forward to meeting you!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-07 11:11:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.078579", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 769, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3384, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3351, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The event takes place during 23rd - 26th, with the hackathon on 21-22.

Despite the fact that I'm not always an unbridled enthusiast of the public gathering, \u00a0ours was unusually constructive. \u00a0\n\nThe launch was not the feared long-winded cutting of a ribbon featuring endless toasts of increasingly power-sapping vino. \u00a0It was something very much more potent: a strategically recruited constellation of citizens with a common will to realise their dreams for their community. \u00a0Judging by the tangible energy generated by the mapping process, they have every chance of succeeding...\n\nIf I try to trace my assumptions as to what I took as the installation of the greatest hits of a Edgeryder collective, convergent vision upon a rather unsuspecting community, the proposal looked admittedly fragile. \u00a0The revelation today is that what I took as an embassy for foreign ideas, is far from an action of imperialism or evangelism. \u00a0We won't be walking into endless confrontations with non-comprehending locals. \u00a0Instead, my worse case scenario has been radically altered. \u00a0After the exposure to some 40 or so concerned, active voices who sacrificed the first Saturday of spring to be put through the paces by Ben and the formidable Gaia via what can sometimes become a rather flimsy mapping procedure, a sufficiently diverse group of people are primed, hungry \u00a0and engaged in making our presence a vital catalyst. \u00a0We will not be fighting for attention, we will be quickly coming in contact with a vibrant group of people eager to run with whatever relevant stimulus they may derive from our presence. \u00a0Much could indeed be managed without us, If however you are at all flexible during the period we shall be in residence; I urge all Edgeryders to perform a pilgrimage to this truly inspiring community.\n\nFor a peek at the physical environment:\n\n<a href=\"http://%E2%80%8Bhttp://www.materacittanarrata.it/homepage.asp\">\u200bhttp://www.materacittanarrata.it/homepage.asp</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-03-24 20:45:47", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 05:38:25.692917", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 371, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 45.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [13], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12176, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1382, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Real potential medecine reducer is quantum healing</b>\n\nI am glad that you mention good food as having a potential for reducing medecine.\n\n<span><span>Good</span> <span>food is good,</span> <span>because it</span> <span>allows for a</span> <span>good</span> <span>lifestyle</span><span>,</span> <span>which</span> <span>in turn can</span> <span>lead to happiness</span><span>.</span></span> <span><span>Cooking</span> <span>is good</span><span>,</span> <span>because it</span> <span>allows to use</span> <span>creativity</span>,<span> share</span> <span>with others,</span> <span>live</span> <span>in the moment,</span> <span>etc.</span></span>\n\nHowever, the real medecine reducer potential lies not in food, but somewhere else. <span><span>The solution is</span> <span>really very simple</span> <span>and</span> is <span>not expensive</span><span>.</span></span> <span><span>If this solution were </span><span>applied to</span> <span>our societies</span><span>, spending on</span> <span>health care would be</span> <span>reduced to</span> <span>virtually</span> <span>zero</span><span>.</span></span> <span><span>It is in</span> <span>health</span> <span>that government budgets</span> <span>are the highest</span><span>,</span> <span>and yet</span> <span>there is</span> <span>still no</span> <span>overarching</span> <span>vision</span> <span>that can </span><span>help people</span> <span>be healthier</span><span>.</span></span>\n\nNone of our medical interventions either get to the root cause of disease, or make a significant difference in mortality or morbidity.

However, thoughts and a harmful lifestyle are the real root for unhealthy people.\n\nIf someone eats bio food and takes extra care about what he/she eats, but has discursive thoughts all day long, and almost all year long, is filled with hate, <span><span>maintains</span> <span>thoughts</span> <span>of</span> <span>greed</span> <span>and</span> <span>selfishness, </span></span><span><span>has a</span> <span>heart</span> the size of <span>a raisin</span><span>,</span> <span>whatever he/she puts </span> <span>in his/her mouth</span><span>, it </span></span><span><span>will</span> <span>not maintain </span><span>health over time.</span></span> A harmful lifestyle is caused by a loss of simplicity and loss of trust (disconnection from oneness). The experience of alienation, fragmentation, isolation (the experience of the separate self) ultimately leads to all the problems, like contamination of the environment, hostility towards each other, poor nutrition, and too much work. A work-oriented society, a success oriented society, in which we believe that material objects are the only source of our happiness, is preventing individuals from reaching a state of happiness.\n\nWhen it comes to healing, it is unfortunate, but science doesn't have an idea yet of the role that spirit plays. Quantum healing involves healing one mode of consciousness, the mind, to bring about changes in another mode of consciousness, the body. And this is possible by letting the spirit come into action.\n\nWhen someone feels intensely happy, or ecstaty, or feels that he/she knows what needs to be known on that moment, this person is connected to spirit. There are three signs of a connection with spirit: love, you feel connected to everything, you feel an intoxication of love; second, knowing this, you feel that you know what you need to know (creativity); and the third is happiness, being happy enough to reach a state where a dormant energy gets unleashed (by the spirit). When someone feels an intoxication of love, has the intuition and creativity (because that's part of knowing this), or when feels happy, then this person is close to spirit.\n\nWhen someone has these experiences in consciousness (meaning triggers the happiness process), then the body starts to secrete simultaneously serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin and opiates. Serotonin and dopamine are called the 'happy hormones'. When people are depressed, they are given serotonin. Opiates are the hormones that make us feel high, sometimes when we run or exercise, or even during sexual experience. Oxytocin is the hormone which causes secretion of milk in mothers when they breastfeed a baby. Scientists have shown that oxytocin might be secreted also during sexual pleasure, in particular during orgasm. While the body is secreting the 'happy hormones', the immune system is also being regulated (ie healing is taking place at the quantum level). All cells of the body become 'happy' and therefore, someone is less inclined to contracting viruses or developing long term illness, or using medecine.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-09 16:30:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:09.600617", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1058, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15479, "user_id": 145, "topic_id": 1787, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>macro and micro</b>\n\nhi alberto, sounds like a good idea overall, but lets not overemphasize so-called tracks and services over sessions, or even just personal introductions and stories just to start...there needs to be encouragement and support for people just to enter in the front door (maybe look around a bit), warm up to this larger organizational potential and just feel inspired to even share one small thing to start...\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-17 11:32:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:27.118984", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 76, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14593, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 5801, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Sure, any time this week is good for me\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-09 14:18:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:22.347249", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10917, "user_id": 443, "topic_id": 1266, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>difficulties</b>\n\nWell,\n\nI've been applying for jobs like: Promoter or Waiter.

We seem to not fully understand the system we're building here :D Maybe we can gather some more insights in a discussion starting from these draft thoughts:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Basic property: no scarceness of medium of exchange.</strong> In our money-based capitalist system, money is expensive because of interest: it's only handed out if you can promise to bring back more, in the short term. That is, it's only handed out for activities that produce short-term high ROI. While there's a lot of activities that would create ROI on the long term \u2013 creating forests, for example. But they take 100 years to grow, and then deliver a \"meager\" ROI of 1% per year. Now the diminishing economic growth rates, decade after decade, indicate that we hit a limit of short term ROI options (after we've burnt through most of our natural resources, that is ...). A quick \"solution\" was the virtualization of economy into financial products, creating much of the current mess. In barter however, there's no interest, and also no scarcity of the exchange medium itself. If a deal can happen depends only on peoples offers and demands, not on the added consideration if somebody has cash or credit available to spend. Given that this money scarcity affects esp. the unemployed, barter trade should help here the most: they can start to be economically active again.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Making \"gain\" is possible.</strong> Multi-party barter does not exclude gain: you can set prices according to market dynamics, which allows to set prices of offered goods higher than the efforts you need for producing them, or letting them produce. Which means, because you barter 1:1 in value, that you have some incoming \"surplus\" effort: your gain, which you can use for whatever you like. Meaningful or nonsense. In this sense, Economy App does not eliminate capitalism; which can be seen as an advantage for its voluntary adoption. We will see that it does away with significant problems of capitalism nonetheless.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Labor in high demand.</strong> In current money-based capitalism, there's a striking internal contradiction: to make more gain, businesses try to employ less people; individually, this makes sense, but on system level this leads to large-scale unemployment in coexistence with an economy that can nonetheless produce everything for everybody; but, because of unemployment, far from everybody is able to buy this stuff, limiting the growth or even causing the demise of business.\n\nIn barter economy however it's different: in the example of \"making gain\" above, the seller has to provide demand for products and services of the same value as the products he wants to sell, or no deal will happen. Which provides compensated work to those interested to buy a product from them.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Big business can still exist.</strong> Because of scale effects, industrial scale production is said to be more efficient, which means making lower prices. So it can still exist in barter economy, but it can no longer use a limited individual economic perspective of \"just wanting to sell for money\" without caring where people's money will come from after they replaced more and more workers with machines. Because there's no money as intermediary storage for value (and, more importantly, no interest based money investment opportunities as self-multiplying storage for value), they have to invest their gain into products and services of others <em>completely</em> and <em>simultaneous to making that gain</em>. A barter deal economy thus should always \"go round\", not being affected by boom-and-bust cycles.</li>\n\n<li><strong>But price of labor increases.</strong> I'm quite sure that it does, because the demand for labor increases to 100% of the value of products and services provided. When demand increases and supply stays the same, price increases. But I can't find the exact meachnism how this would happen in this specific case. In effect though, it should be a liberation of workers from the wage dumping present in late-industrial societies.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nNow I'd like to more clearly understand the economics of this system. Better terms, clearer thoughts, connecting to economic concepts ...\n\n", "created_at": "2013-04-14 16:36:15", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:02.112277", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 732, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 230.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11623, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5669, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Any time</b>\n\nOf course, my friend, and it sucks that you even have to do this stuff.\u00a0\n\nIf you want me to, I'll come to the Brussels meeting as well.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-03 12:58:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:06.830894", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 39, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9201], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27047, "user_id": 809, "topic_id": 1407, "post_number": 40, "raw": "<b>Dear Matthias,</b>\n\nThank you for very, very useful reply.\n\nI am indeed aware of option 4.

Remember how long it took mechanical engineering until the development of the universal <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_metric_screw_thread\">ISO thread standard</a>, and all the different solutions they had before? Same with e-mail. It takes time, and happens after a phase of exploration. The (mainstream) Internet spent the last 20 years with exploration, and it's good to see that you and others promote standards actively now ...not to say aggressively :D\n\nIn the case of Makerfox however, we're still well in the phase of exploration (in a space of 648 proposed features ... not kidding). So far nobody knows how to do network barter right, not even in a silo, much less in a decentralized system. We currently care for getting it right on one platform. Getting it right as a decentralized system has some hard tech problems for later: for example, we can't simply agree on a data format for asset sharing \u2013 barter trades are made fully automatically, so if we want to grant that capability to any party in a decentralized network, we need to develop a distributed database with distributed atomic transactions to avoid selling / buying the same thing twice. That's well beyond our capacity for now.\n\nSo, sorry but we have to postpone the standards development for now. At this time, other work on network barter creates more benefit; because from the view of both a platform and users, a standard that has zero adoption has zero benefit compared to a silo. And that's where a standard starts. Compare Mozilla Persona: for most users, at this time, only one of their websites offers Persona login. I still like Persona, and we support it with edgeryders.eu, but you get the point: investing in interoperability is an <em>investment</em> for a platform that may pay off some time in the future, but not immediately. And for investments, you need the resources to invest ...\n\nBut I agree that we could start with something simple into the direction you propose: product and service offer imports and exports <em>in and from the silo</em> using an open catalogue data standard. Maybe you know what would be the most adequate existing standard for this?\n\nP.S. re. source code: As promised, we'll release the core part (network barter algorithm) as free software. But give us a little headstart before the open source release \u2013 I've been competed out of business by big capital before (Amazon and eBay getting into <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/ankauf-webshop-eroeffnen\">\"our\" electronics remanufacturing market</a>).

This all started when the US mortgage market collapsed in 2007. Prior to that, the US and elsewhere had been engaged in a practice called securitization (Mortgage Backed Securities primarily), which allows banks to make loans and then sell them as investments. A large number of those securitized loans were sold to European Banks. \n\nThose loans rapidly became worthless, as the US housing market collapsed, and the European Banks lost a lot of money. (Or perhaps to be more precise, should be receiving money now from the US that they're not.)\n\nThe now weakened European banks then got hit by the separate European crises. Some of which is caused by securitization of loans here, especially Ireland, Spain, Belgium, and I believe Italy, and some of which is caused by something by more insidious, which is that inside the Eurozone, the money supplies of the various countries, because of differences in their banking systems are expanding at different rates.\n\nNone of the Banks that I'm aware of were in breach of Basel 2, which is not exactly a very strict set of requirements when you really understand it. It basically requires that Banks have a certain proportion of capital, to back their outstanding loans, and the proportion of capital required depends on the type of loan being made. Critically, loans to Governments with AA* rating and above have a 0% capital requirement which essentially means they can lend as much money to the Government as they want. Keynsian economists rejoice.\n\nOf course, if you're lending to the Government with a 0% risk weighting, or to somebody to buy a house which you're then going to sell off to a pension fund (so also no risk), the one person you are not going to lend to is some cap in hand entrepreneur who has an idea for starting a company, or even an established business that wants to expand. So over time, there goes the industrial base.\n\nSo then specifically to Italy. If the short term commercial lending market has frozen up, that's very bad. That's basically what the US had to intervene to prevent in 2007 and was what led to the TARP program (which may well be what Europe now needs to do). Although, I do question the business sense of the people involved, in relying on borrowed money for short term liquidity.\n\nLooking at the Bank of Italy's latest statistics, here:\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/cmv8esj\n\nit's not entirely easy to wade through, but it looks like there is a very slight contraction over the last couple of months in the money and loan supply, and probably more significantly they are not expanding as fast as they were. But this shouldn't effect the short term market to the extent you're said. It probably is enough to cause problems to one specific class of business, which is the economic niche occupied by people who borrow money, and make just enough profit to pay the interest on their debt, and take out a new loan to avoid repaying it. The 50% bad debt ratio on the securitized loans is rather eye popping too.\n\nWhat's really interesting is on p18, the reserve requirement appears to have been dropped, as of February 2012, and on p19 the negative Intra-European Net claims. This gets nasty to explain, but basically banks have their own accounts with each other, and when our deposit money is moved between banks, this is what's used to actually transfer the money. From that table it looks like there's a fairly sizeable net flow of money out of Italy, and that will cause fairly major problems with lending by the Italian banks, because they have to also take that into account when the make loans. If you want to get into the guts of how that  works, I just posted a very technical paper trying to explain it on arxiv:\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1583\n\nSo if i were to guess, and that's all it would be, it's that that's where the real problem is. But who really knows. When you get into it this, this thing is a monster, and i don't honestly think anybody really understands it properly.", "created_at": "2012-05-02 14:13:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:45.949160", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 741, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3771, "user_id": 30, "topic_id": 3738, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/922dde059cc20fbe3c75c5cd4f16294b4627a005.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"461\"><br>\n\nOver the last couple of months I\u2019ve had a very odd experience of having some of my core political certainties shaken to the core, and others confirmed in a way which feels almost dirty in its precision and gloatworthyness. I\u2019ve been wrong, and I\u2019ve been right, and I\u2019m here to tell you all about it. I've been wrong about Belarus, right about Bitcoin, and these two experiences represent, for me, two ends of a spectrum, two sides of the world, which have both have recently taught me big lessons.\n\nMuch of my life is politics, both the long term goals I have (like abolishing poverty as we know it through voluntary cooperation and open source engineering) and the short tem day to day actions to support those goals; more and more I'm called to decide, not to do. Age, I suppose. I like to think of myself as a fairly politically sophisticated thinker. Bruce Sterling once called me \u201c<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2009/10/and-yet-another-pirate-manifesto/\">some guy with a relatively coherent interest in conventional fringe politics</a>\u201d which I thought was rather a fine compliment from a notoriously harsh judge. I kinda thought I had this under control.\n\nBut I\u2019m not a real scholar like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anarchodin\">Herbert Snorrason</a>\u00a0 or a political doer like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smarimc\">Smari McCarthy</a>. I\u2019m in a slightly different gear, a pragmatic theoretician, a <a href=\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004123.html\">researching political engineer</a>. To me, politics is the art and science of causing change to occur in conformity with will. There is a continuum of political decision-making from the small politics involved in being the director of a small enterprise, through to the larger and larger political calls that have to be made.\n\nThe space of choices is huge, and to make it easier to cooperate with each-other when trying to create large scale change, we work together in teams. Call these teams, parties, ideologies, even countries, these teams are about the core values and action principles which enable us to get things done. If one is an anarchist or a Conservative, certain decision procedures and axiomatic beliefs act as steering points so that people know roughly how we will analyze problems, manage data, and respond to a crisis! Patterns of belief are helpful stereotypes, nothing more... and nothing less. Ideally they help us cooperate, giving us an edge against the Collective Action Problem. At worst, they meaninglessly divide us.\n\nBut what happens when these stereotypes turn out to be wrong?\n\n<strong>My images of the USSR</strong> came from two places: dim memories of the Cold War era, when they were The Enemy, and a few visits to Berlin over the past few years. In Berlin I spent most of my time in East Berlin or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreuzberg\">Kreutzberg</a>. In East Berlin marvelled at the architecture - the grand scale, the boldness of Alexanderplatz and the TV Tower, all permeated with the stories of the Stasi and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=west+berlin+east+berlin+standoff&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=zYR&amp;channel=fs&amp;gl=uk&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5sQuVJjmLMThaNH7gbAG&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ#channel=fs&amp;gl=uk&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=jump+over+line+west+berlin&amp;facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=gg2S_WWJt0jDMM%253A%3BOPGkaFK-jrpBnM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Flegalinsurrection.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2014%252F09%252FWoman-makes-if-over-line-between-East-and-West-Germany-Historical-Pics-589x442.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Flegalinsurrection.com%252F2014%252F09%252Fthis-photo-will-mean-absolutely-nothing-to-college-students%252F%3B589%3B442\">people jumping over painted lines into West Berlin</a>, or jumping out of second floor windows on to piles of mattresses as The Wall went up. I used to joke about Aldi being an East German supermarket chain, then realized it probably was and, hey, good enough. It was all a very long time ago.\n\n<strong>Then I went to Belarus.</strong>\n\nI almost deliberately didn\u2019t do exhaustive research first; I checked the basics as I would before any trip - currency, visas (got that one wrong; but that\u2019s a long story) and health insurance. All fine, no problems. Low crime stats, safe society. Same leader in charge for 20 years and a government that is described in terms that start at \u201crather stern\u201d and proceed from there in no uncertain terms.\n\n<strong>I\u2019m ashamed to say</strong> that some part of my mind thought I was going to <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=1970s+albania&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=jv6&amp;channel=fs&amp;gl=uk&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=asUuVKGbF9Dtar-OgrgH&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=671#channel=fs&amp;gl=uk&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=communist+albania\">1970s Albania</a>. I had a graven image in my mind, a fixed and rigid preconception that authoritarian socialism could only produce unhappiness, poverty and a stuck-in-the-past social rigidity.\n\nI could not have been more wrong.\n\nOne of the things I looked at first was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29_per_capita\">GDP per capita</a> - \u201chow much money do the Belarusian have, on average?\u201d There are all kinds of problems with GDP per capita as an index, even if you <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita\">PPP-adjust your GDP calculations</a> (purchasing power parity) to take account of difference is the price of tortillas from place to place. You need the <a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/belarus/gini-index-wb-data.html\">Gini coefficient to measure inequality</a>, ideally you\u2019d like to differentiate between averages and means, get a sense of the ownership of property and so on. Belarus had a GDP/capita of around $7000 per person, PPP adjusted to $15,000 or so. That\u2019s right around Mexico, Botswana, Turkey. By comparison, Georgia has much lower GDP per capita than Belarus, and PPP-adjusted standards of living are about half that of the Belarusians.\n\nI\u2019d been to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_%28country%29\">Georgia</a>, my other encounter with the post-Soviet world, only a couple of months before, for <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-helps-undp-spot-the-future-in-armenia-georgia-and-egypt/2470\">Spot the Future</a>. <strong>Georgia was a real shock to my system</strong>: ride from the airport in a 1950s Trabant taxi that bought gas a dollar at a time (and this was not the last of our taxi adventures), potholes the size of asteroid craters, driving styles straight out of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4vQzQwcZ1Y\">Mad Max</a>, escalators with half inch gaps, one of which nearly crushed my a finger in a loose guard rail, the whole bit. This might sound like I\u2019m just grousing about transportation infrastructure, but the feeling it gave me was that Georgia was an actively dangerous place to be, not because of crime or violence, but simply because the infrastructure was decayed, and the social norms very, very different - as with the taxi driver who simply got out of his cab at an intersection and wandered away (maybe to ask directions?) leaving us sitting in the cab in the middle of a busy intersection. I was really not in Kansas any more. These are trivial objections, but I'm an <a href=\"http://resiliencemaps.org/\">infrastructure nerd</a>, and they rattled me. The flip side of Georgia is that on paper they\u2019re as poor as Swaziland or Guyana on paper, so they\u2019re doing pretty damn well with it - it\u2019s a real, functioning society with high quality of life. The food, music and civic engagement are superb: it\u2019s a place of deep culture, and I greatly enjoyed my time there. In short, I was troubled by the infrastructure, a little shocked by the poverty among the street beggars, and filled with joy and excitement about the cultural environment: the sense of action, of a culture that runs on profoundly different rules to the Euromerican norms I\u2019ve basically spent my life inside of. It was <em>other\u00a0</em>but <em>good-other</em>. And, yes, I\u2019m not much of a tourist.\n\nThat was Georgia.\n\n(<em>You may all now proceed to laugh at somebody who doesn\u2019t even drive a car talking about how scary the road transport is. I know, I\u2019m sorry, this is just a big thing for me given how common a cause of death road traffic accidents are globally. This is a tough scene. These things scare me</em>.\n\n<em>Also, let me put in a word for the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DiveTbilisi\">Dive Bar in Tbilisi</a> which, once I realized that it was modeled on an old west saloon with furniture made out of crates and beer pong instead of poker, was about the funnest drinking hole I have ever had the good fortune to experience</em>.)\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Anyway, this was my experience and preconception of the post-Soviet world</strong>, and I\u2019m framing it carefully because it\u2019s probably not all that different from your preconceptions of the post-Soviet world, and I\u2019m here to tell you not only are those preconceptions wrong, but there\u2019s a good chance that your entire understanding of the Soviet union was also wrong, and largely based on our own Euromerican propaganda.\n\nBelarus was a real shock to my system.\n\nOf course, I should have known. Minsk was one of the sacred cities of <a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2587515574/perelmann-jerohman-judah-leib.html\">Jewish culture</a> before the Holocaust, much like Vienna. Yiddish had once been an official language of government in the area. The place had <em>culture</em>. You don\u2019t wind up with Jews that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Belarus\">deeply integrated</a> into a society which isn\u2019t fundamentally cosmopolitan at some level, and of course Russia, before the Revolution, had always been the business end of a lot of what we now think of as \u201cEuropean\u201d culture. Before the Cold War, it was a real cultural power whose values and ideas were felt across a continent.\n\n<strong>So I arrived in Belarus, with my idiot brain thinking 1970s Albania, and walked out into 2014 West Berlin.</strong> Broad streets, prosperous people, new cars. Deeply efficient municipal infrastructure, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=apartment+building+belarus&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=tSm&amp;channel=fs&amp;gl=uk&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b8guVJnQBozeaoDWgrAI&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg#channel=fs&amp;gl=uk&amp;tbs=itp:photo&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=minsk+architecture+night\">stunning architecture</a>, and the excellent beer that I\u2019ve come to expect outside of the Anglosphere, but particularly points east.\n\nI think about the GDP numbers: $15,000 PPP-adjusted, $7000 straight, and it viscerally hits me that not only do the numbers not tell the real story, they hardly tell the story at all: my own combination of bad statistics and bad history have left me completely wrong footed and disoriented. It looks like the nicer parts of West Berlin. On $7000 each. <strong>This is, to my mind at the time, impossible</strong>. I must understand how this is happening!\n\nThis starts a real investigation, a political inquiry, into how Belarus works. Obvious questions get asked, and only not of official sources, but of civil society actors and activists: is the rest of the country terrible? \u201cNo, it\u2019s much the same, no worse than the drop off between London and Liverpool.\u201d Is there some terrible buried social problem that\u2019s the price of all this prosperity? \u201cNo, everything\u2019s basically fine.\u201d This comes even from the activists, who are preoccuped by the need for bike lanes that will work well in winter and similar issues. Things are fine.\n\nOf course, they don\u2019t vote on the same basis we do. The KGB is still called that. The government is called very rude names by the international community. But the ground truth is that Belarus, like Cuba, appears to have created an enormously functional society in economic conditions that could easily have left them ground into the dirt growing potatoes on every square inch of spare soil and looking for massive international aid just to keep the basics of society running.\n\nSo how does it work? I\u2019m not going to address the political questions now: they are there, but that story you\u2019ve heard already, every time somebody mentions the place on television. Economically, there seem to be three angles.\n\nFirstly, <strong>half the population work in state run enterprises</strong> or the government itself, and they really don\u2019t get paid very much. $500 a month was bandied about, but I haven\u2019t been able to find detailed stats.\n\nSecondly, there\u2019s a ton of \u201cdo the right thing\u201d<strong> investment in mass production of social goods</strong>. Need more housing? Build more housing. This kind of approach takes a huge amount of the pressure out of the society: over-all I\u2019d say people were happier than in London, and fundamentally more relaxed and less afraid. When social goods are produced on this kind of scale, there are massive economies of scale, and the economy adapts around those problems being solved. It seems to work, give-or-take political issues.\n\nFinally, <strong>Belarus has ancient culture. Minsk is still Minsk, regardless of who is running it</strong> or what the political system is. A massively educated population (it was a major centre of science and technology in the USSR) have depth and sophistication and intellectual capital sufficient to make things work out under whatever system they are working with. The city was rebuilt after being razed after WW2 and immense resources were spent into making it look like the best of what it had been before. Deep culture and the patina of a place which has been a cosmopolitan center for many centuries gives a richness to life which is largely independent of many other factors. It's Minsk.\n\nThe turning point for me was in a discussion with a social enterprise about how hard it was to get buildings for bottom-up social good projects in Belarus. They told a story of how difficult and expensive it was, and I shared my tales of trying to solve the same problem in London, and it was the same story: there, bureaucracy, here the ferocious expense of our property markets and the disproportionate power of landlords in our society. We were doing about equally well, against different obstacles to accessing the same basic class of resources. Maybe out situations weren't so different after all?\n\nI am not convinced that they have it worse than us, and Britain on a GDP of $15,000 PPP each would be hell on earth. The Belarusian modes of production make relative abundance far beyond their apparent financial means, and reduce the fear, insecurity and precarity which are so much parts of our experience of life here. It made me wonder where the UK would be if the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_miners%27_strike_%281984%E2%80%9385%29\">Miner's Strike had brought down Thatcher</a> and pushed us far left of our current position. Would it have been so bad? Is Socialism possible?\n\n<strong>But what of political rights? </strong>I am not going to speak for either our system or their system: I can\u2019t do justice to that without a much better understanding of the country. I will say this, though: I suspect that, given what we know from the Snowden revelations, including technical issues, I was functionally under <em>less</em> surveillance in Belarus than the UK. The UK and American state has not been playing by the agreed rules of our own societies, and it\u2019s not at all clear that we understand what rules our own governments have been playing by these past twenty years. Much as I suspect I would not do very well in Belarusian society in the long run,\u00a0 we have still lost an awful lot of ground on civil liberties in the Anglosphere in the past few decades, and Belarus is one of the few places I could go to get a genuinely different point of reference to consider those issues from. Consider the rhetoric of our societies, and their reality.\u00a0\n\nBelarus is hard to discuss for the same reasons that Cuba, China or Israel are difficult to discuss, but no traveller comes back from these places unchanged, simply by virtue of seeing how a completely different society, that questions many of our fundamental ways of thinking about the world works. There is profit in it.\u00a0\n\nThis brings me to bitcoin.\n\nAn American friend of mine ended the Scottish Socialist phase of my life with a single phrase: \u201cSocialism requires a central government with arbitrary powers.\u201d I became a Libertarian a few days later. But what I\u2019ve observed since that time has left me with a much more complicated relationship to that observation than I had at first. At the time, in those days, I was fresh out of Scottish Socialism. I\u2019d been raised on the working class Unions And Benefits culture of the Scottish working class; raised on the family mythology that one of my ancestors, an agitator, had avoided becoming a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolpuddle_Martyrs\">Tolpuddle Martyr</a> by leaving 15 minutes early to go to the pub.\n\nAmerica did not have an income tax until 1913 or so. It was instituted to fight WW1, essentially, and<a href=\"http://www.rightwinggranny.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/outlays-GDP.png\"> the Federal Government increased in size by dozens of times</a> by the present day. In the first century and a bit of American history, they could only raise taxes by import/export taxation and a few other mechanisms: money was hard to come by for the Federal Government, and it really was small enough to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Norquist#Views_on_government\">drown in a bathtub</a>, should the need arise. Since then, the Federal Government has grown until it is, frankly, probably of comparable size to the Belarusian one if we could find a good instrument to measure. Budget won't cut it, alas, as I was so acutely reminded by my experiences there: GDP is a poor measure of value indeed, but if we calculated the size of the US government (including all contractors and monopolies it has created) I suspect the scale might not be far off, measured in manpower rather than fraction of GDP.\n\nThe Bitcoiners were, initially, and largely remain hard line <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/blog/quotes-from-satoshi-understanding-bitcoin-through-the-lens-of-its-enigmatic-creator\">anti-State Libertarians</a>. Being able to produce money itself as a private good (and fie to the people who say bitcoin isn\u2019t money: quack quack!) was an unbelievable breakthrough in Libertarian practice. Gold served that function in many minds, but gold has an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_bug\">enormous history and legacy</a>, and the actual processes of mining are brutally environmentally destructive and often rely on near slave labour conditions for the workers, never mind the toxicity of the chemicals used in the industry. A lot of that is very hard to square with good Libertarian practice, unlike racks and racks of shiny boxes turning coal into hash collisions to \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin (computer manufacturing and energy production notwithstanding.) You can perhaps understand those computers are automated roulette wheels, proving to each-other that you have won some bitcoin: gambling against a house that everybody agrees pays you when you come up Green-00 eight times in a row.\n\nProvably fair gambling where you get paid to spin the wheel, and can provably transferably assign your winnings to others if you like.\n\nSocialism was, at the time, an enormous political innovation. Many implementations failed, although having seen the gap between the public perception of life in Belarus and the reality, I\u2019m now questioning much of what I think I understand about the Soviet Union, and China itself. Some appear to succeed, and I think Cuba (haven\u2019t been yet) and Belarus appear to be evidence of that. It\u2019s obvious to me now that the Libertarians are going to get their State, one way or the other.\n\nThe<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_State_Project\"> Free State Project</a> might succeed in changing the way America works over 20 or 50 years, that\u2019s one angle: a Libertarian fork of the Republican Party could get a president in a few decades, and implement something which is as much a jump from the current Thatcher/Reagan basis as Thatcher/Reagan was from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurin_Bevan\">Bevan</a>/FDR Welfare State. Or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasteading#The_Seasteading_Institute\">Seasteading</a> will bear fruit over a shorter time period, based on bloated bitcoin bank accounts, or somebody will take some other, <a href=\"http://athousandnations.com/2009/04/21/free-guptastan/\">even more eccentric ideas</a> seriously. Pre-bitcoin, Libertarianism was largely theory. Post-bitcoin it is clearly a theory, practice and orthopraxis. You can get things done with Libertarianism.\n\nHowever, as many predicted, Libertarians are getting a real lesson in how the world really works, finally having been handed (or, more correctly, having constructed) the whip hand. As I\u2019ve <a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/beyond-new-york-lies-ahead-bitcoin/\">rattled on about elsewhere</a> (scroll down for the Bitcoin Foundation's take on this line of analysis) the classical anarchist critiques of Libertarianism have always revolved around the formation of monopolies and cartels, and the bitcoin foundation is effectively a monopoly on political legitimacy in the bitcoin space - you talk to them if you want to talk to \u201cbitcoin\u201d as an entity. In this role, it is The State and is, of course, hated for it - but how naturally it formed! Likewise, ghash chooses to be less than 50% of mining capacity in the bitcoin network, but on any given day is one phone call and a kind word away from being able to facilitate double spending at any time. The anarchist critique of Libertarianism looks<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KybZAEm0stY&amp;list=UUmZ94fbKKGoBDY_g4hzR-MA\"> pretty realistic to me</a> right now.\n\nAn awful lot of what happened in the worst ends of State Socialism were predicted by critics, although I\u2019m not sure that anybody really predicted the sheer scale of some of the problems (historians: did anybody?) Likewise, the formation of cartels and natural monopolies inside of Libertarian space was predicted, and happened. We find it relatively easy to poke holes in things and find it quite hard to make things without any holes, but somehow, from time to time, perhaps inspite of ourselves we build things that work.\n\nIt\u2019s very clear to me that the Libertarian experiment is going to get tried, and that the anarchists are going to stand around saying \u201cI told you so.\u201d Cuba, Belarus and the Social Democracies/Welfare States have made it pretty clear that the Socialist end of the spectrum is not without its virtues either (compare Cuba to Haiti, say.) But I am still left with a core question: <a href=\"http://www.ianwelsh.net/a-new-ideology/\">can any political ideology we have face down the twin terrible threats of climate change and uncontrolled technological innovation</a>?\n\nWe may have to<a href=\"http://www.ianwelsh.net/the-role-of-character-and-ideology-in-prosperity/\"> innovate in ideology</a> faster to fix our real problems. Any idea how we could start?\n\n<strong><a href=\"/search/content/belarus?f%5B0%5D=uid%3A6159\">Read more about EdgeRyders in Belarus and Spot the Future here!</a></strong>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-03 16:39:42", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 10:15:07.461287", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4212, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 35.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 892, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 859, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6071/6149715662_92a3d5f9b4_z.jpg\" title=\"Workshop Weekend at Supermarkt in Berlin, August 27-28 2011\" width=\"640\"> On August 27 and 28 respectively, I\u00a0 co-facilitated a workshop session and hosted a full day workshop in Berlin for the Youth In Transition project called Edgeryders.

Insights from the workshop:</h2>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>That in designing a platform for collaboratively drafting enabling policies and practicies to help manage different aspects of <a href=\"http://edgeryders.bmeme.com/9-2/\">the transition</a>, we are in a sense designing a platform for peer to peer learning outside institutions. If we want to build something that will be a tool that generates value for it\u2019s users regardless of whether or not policymakers end up adopting the policy recommendations, we need to ask how, in our platform, we:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>identify, learn and record our experiences?</li>\n\n<li>connect with others and to learn?</li>\n\n<li>get feedback for what we've learnt?</li>\n\n<li>balance what we want to learn with what we need find space for continual learning amongst work, family and other life responsibilities?</li>\n\n<li>connect our personal learning experiences with our formal learning opportunities?</li>\n\n<li>negotiate the transitions between online, international learning and our local context?</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li> That it may be better to frame the initiative/ platform as an interactive experience, rather than a social network or game or school. It is a story space with some game elements in it.</li>\n\n<li>That we should keep the design and implementation process as open as possible, and that there is an engaged community waiting to happen around the project if we let them in and give them a say in how it is run. This also means we have to put some time and effort into finding and using tools for design, development and requirements gathering/ feedback that enable this openness as well as allow us to engage and build a community starting immediately. \u00a0[Do you have suggestions for how to do this? I\u2019m happy to give everyone access to the Mybalsamiq account if you want to go ahead and modify the wireframes I\u2019m producing, or post alternatives- ]</li>\n\n<li>That an important value added would be to help facilitate and support participants in our journey of self-discovery. If we can help participants in surfacing their values, hidden dreams, goals. motivation and personality that would be great. If we can help them to synthesize their unique combination of talents, skills. strengths, drivers, knowledge and what they really love to do into an outwardly coherent personal narrative that would be a big contribution.</li>\n\n<li>And that we need a means for the community to express gratitude to individual community members who make \u201cquiet\u201d contributions to it, as well as reciprocity and a pay it forward ethic to be embedded into the DNA of our project.</li>\n\n<li>There is a big desire for good news, and that the tone of our project should not be one of gloom and doom but of solidarity in the face of adversity.</li>\n\n<li>Role models should be presented as individuals with strengths and weaknesses, successes and failures and they should feel accessible \u2014 people who rise to a challenge as opposed to people who are extraordinarily gifted etc.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<h2><span><strong>Want to help?

Unfortunately the entire downstairs area still suffers from a lack of heating and is essentially unusable. Hot water works in all bathrooms upstairs and made an appearance in the kitchen for a day and then disappeared again.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\nIt turns out that the underfloor heating present in the building, is the first of its kind in the area - so comprehensive documentation and knowledge on how to resolve all issues is lacking. </span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span><span>Internet</span></span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span><span>We have for the moment a generally unreliable internet connection, shared with Matera2019, which has been down now for 72 hours.

No matter the many\u00a0versions of who bears the responsibility for losing such talent and youth, the place, like many of our generation's\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tausance/posts/10153193959482135\">underground</a> cultural spaces, was really ill equipped to deal with any incidents and had been nonetheless approved for business (only one exit, no fire extinguishers, and highly flammable materials covering walls). After shock and excruciating pain, we're in an awakening of sorts, since this was a tipping point after a previous accident where politics contributed to loss of human lives. For the last days we've been gathering, marching and demanding resignation of public officials and change of government, political class, system change, \\#changeeverything basically.\n\nOur PM resigned yesterday, as well as the mayor of the sector (Bucharest districts are called \"sectors\") where the club was based. Clubs and cultural venues everywhere are closing for fear, or being shut down as we speak. We've moved from a sense of collective guilt in the first days to cashing in on years of crappy politics. 70K people yesterday on the streets they say, craziest mobilisation in decades.\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/34605c425de155f0976c7fc5c1828b3885eeedc9.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nBut what does the future hold and can we do something about it?

Reading its live feed is somewhat painful, as you can see people trying to self-organise massively with no plan or rules whatsoever, and most of those proposed have no political competences, for good or bad.\u00a0\n\nSome elite groups that I know of are sitting on the sidelines, non-committal in so far as building a new political movement is concerned. They seem to know that whoever speaks first is discredited along the lines of \"only he who is not interested in governing should govern\". Maybe there's not enough will, capacity, and too much realism about all that can go wrong.\n\nThen there is you, me and everyone else who is not too young or naive to eat crap, not too old or cynical to stay home, but clearly part of a generation who cares enough to be willing to go the extra mile and back a political alternative if needed. My friend Zoli <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kelemenzoltan/posts/1056181994415551?fref=nf\">says it</a> well <em>\"If people who protest do not get involved in politics, in 2 years we will protest again against the Government and the PM, which will be formed of current Opposition. The establishment needs to be changed, not the government.\"</em>\n\n<strong>..have patience.</strong>\u00a0From where I'm standing, there is a pretty sophisticated understanding of the opportunities and odds among the crowds, but navigating this level of complexity takes time.

Whilst I was growing up my mum stood for council and was an active member of my schools parent/teacher association. Then she had what I had now; a desire to be able to make the world a better place. She raised me to believe that I could achieve whatever I put in my mind to do, and without that support, and political knowledge my interests and career wouldn't be where they are now.\n\nI have, for most of my career, worked in the public sector - usually local government and government sponsored bodies. Regardless of the area of expertise, I always found it reassuring that there was someone in the world who knew how to understand the laws and practices of government, as to your average person there is very little chance they have to understand the motivations of government and how their decisions effect the daily lives of the general public.\n\nMy work is mostly a support worker mostly involved in administration and communications; the ability to communicate in a way that is open and understood by everyone is something I feel very strongly about, but I've always been interested in the policy sector that I find myself supporting more often than not, yet I have longed to find my own way in to being more actively involved in this area but due to my lack of a university education I've never really got anywhere. Then I met Vinay, and I was invited along to his Truth and Beauty events. There I was able to discuss things that mattered to me, and others, without feeling that my lack of education restricted me in anyway. My passion was what was important. I know plenty of learned people who can fill in the details for me, but without passion, very little gets done.\n\nFrom Truth and Beauty, I discovered Edgeryders, and having this forum to be able to speak, and to read others inspiring stories has allowed me to realise that I can be a part of a movement that can change the world, and where my opinion is respected and in some cases, sought out. It is a truly inspiring project to be a part of and I look forward to meeting up with a lot of you in Strasbourg where I could well create projects and relationships that may bring about yet more positive change to the lives of those who may not have as much of a voice for whatever reason. Hopefully then I may inspire others to take up their own path to being the change they wish to see in the world.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-13 11:56:55", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 06:36:21.677233", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 531, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19775, "user_id": 1633, "topic_id": 2394, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>I'll investigate</b>\n\nI'm planning to map 'below the radar groups' in Matera anyway so i'm happy to\u00a0look into it.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-02-07 14:33:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:50.123789", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 28, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14107, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5545, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>The engagement strategy in the Grant Agreement</b>\n\nIn the Commission's language, this is called the Communication Plan. You will find it on page 29 of the proposal, as attached to the GA.\n\n======= EXCERPT FOLLOWS ===============\n\n<strong>OpenCare aims its communication activities at \u201cdeep engagement\u201d</strong>. Due to the natural diversity across partners and their communities, it is important that project communications be tailored accordingly, favoring decentralization and ownership of content production by each, instead of a situation where one partner runs all OpenCare information through their own channels. Accordingly, WP0 - Learning, engagement and dissemination - involves all partners.\n\nIn addition to this, we adopt a \u201cworking out loud\u201d culture for all project activities: public blogging of each step on the way. This has advantages in terms of better quality and more search-engine friendly documentation; it teaches the whole team to be better communicators, making all partners comfortable with sharing work in progress, not only results, online and in the open. This practice has an immediate consequence in interactive environments: once anything is published, it can be shared by anyone else, therefore making it easier to plan communication flows and coordinate across partners for maximum reach.\u00a0\n\nOur approach aims to birthe deep engagement rather than visibility for the sole sake of promotion: we communicate to invite people to participate in OpenCare, not to have them admire our work. \u201cEngaging\u201d in this context means taking part in discussion groups on the OpenCare platform and in participatory design workshops or hackathons. Everything that happens offline is carefully documented, and the documentation is fed back to the online conversation. Mainstream social media (Facebook, Twitter etc.) are used to broadcast material from the conversation, and carry links for people who grow interested to head back onto the platform, where the conversation is continuously enriched and can be harvested. Communication channels are:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Open web and mainstream social networks</strong>. Throughout its duration, OpenCare leverages its approach of \u201cworking out loud\u201d and carefully documenting all of its activities to generate content to be reshared on the open web and through the mainstream social networking services. This is greatly facilitated by our distributed approach to collective intelligence: any contribution to the debate can be re-shared simply by clicking on a \u201cshare this\u201d button on the Edgeryders platform, and not just by the team but by anyone.\u00a0<strong>Activities</strong>: narrative building (by ER): blog, design calls for participation, record videos, produce digital flyers to convey the nature of OpenCare and the values contained in the online conversation.\u00a0<strong>Objectives</strong>: an average of 2000 visits a month to the project\u2019s dedicated space throughout the 24 months of OpenCare. An average of 12 signups a week on the platform.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Community calls</strong>. OpenCare continues the Edgeryders tradition of periodic VOIP appointments, where new users are welcomed and onboarded and a team spirit amongst the most active community members is forged. <strong>Activities</strong>: schedule, promote and run community calls (by ER). Participate in them as appropriate (by all partners).\u00a0<strong>Objective</strong>: \u201cdeep engagement\u201d of 5-10 members present at each call (we normally use Google Hangouts, which has a limit of 10 participants).\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Workshops and hackathons</strong>. OpenCare will organize a series of open workshops events (roughly every three months) to share knowledge and skills with its community. For example, LaBRI will run hackathons on network science as a facilitator of collective intelligence, WeMake workshops on 3D printing and CNC milling for prototyping care helpers, and so on.\u00a0<strong>Activities</strong>: events preparation &amp; follow up (by ER, WeMake, MI): create concept notes for the events in collaboration with the community; send out invitations to mailing lists and other online and offline fora where existing partners are active; document and feed back.\u00a0<strong>Objectives</strong>: \u201cdeep engagement\u201d of 25 participants per event. Rich media documentation of each one (video, blog posts, software code etc.), to be reshared on social media.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Participation in events of other communities</strong>. The OpenCare endeavour feeds into a global debate about change for sustainability, of which care redesign is an important part. In a spirit of openness, we participate actively to events where existing communities gather around related issues. We already have ties with some of those communities. Examples include Chaos Communication Congress (hacker culture), OuiShareFest (sharing economy), INSNA Sunbelt AND IEEE/ACM Intern. Conf. Adv. in SNA and Mining (social network analysis), Makerfaire (rapid prototyping and maker culture), DrupalCon (encouraging adoption of Drupal-based tools for collective intelligence) Open Hardware Summit and more. This activity will continue after the project. <strong>Activities</strong>: network weaving (by ER, WeMake, MI, SF, LABRI): roll out engagement campaigns; spread out calls and project materials to communities of hackers, makers, designers, patients and citizens in general, with potential to contribute expertise in the prototyping phase.\u00a0<strong>Objective</strong>: enhanced awareness of OpenCare in those communities, also through getting their most respected and active members to follow our social media channels.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Final conference</strong>. We will organize a conference in the final six months of the project\u2019s life. This will be organized like a barcamp, with the program being assembled from community proposals (including those from the OpenCare team); and aimed at bringing the community together and putting it in contact with stakeholders in the care debate. Its ultimate goal is to share the project\u2019s draft final outputs under Objectives 1 and 2; create demand and expectation for its final outputs; and foster a dialogue with more traditional stakeholders on care. The template for this type of conference is the Living On The Edge format, experimented by ER since 2012.\u00a0<strong>Activities</strong>: conference preparation &amp; follow up (by ER and SF): create concept notes in collaboration with the community; send out invitations to mailing lists and other online and offline fora where existing partners are active;\u00a0<strong>Objectives</strong>: 150 participants, 24 sessions.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Followup</strong>. During and after the project, ER commits to bringing the OpenCare results to the conversations it is already involved in around change for sustainability. Such conversations happen typically around consulting for inter-governmental organizations or large non-governmental ones. At the time of writing, ER finds itself in dialogue with UNDP, UNESCO, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Shuttleworth Foundation.\u00a0<strong>Activities</strong>: advocacy (ER, SF); dissemination of research results in academic fora (LaBRI, SSE).\u00a0<strong>Objective</strong>: mainstreaming the OpenCare approach.</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2016-07-07 17:02:32", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:43.214985", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1108, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24901, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 6321, "post_number": 16, "raw": "@Nadia, only\u00a0nnegash is on the list.

If people don't come, the neighborhood is isolated, economically fragile and ultimately unable to resist gentrification. If they do come, the locals do not like it and push back. Also, this creates tensions among the locals: Luca told me that the shopkeepers were happy to see new people (new customers! yay!), but the local people who are not shopkeepers were upset.\u00a0\n\nSo here is a big question: when caring for a neighborhood, do you think that at some point you'll have to take sides?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-21 17:05:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:51.331076", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 227, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6652, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1665, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Forced fees?</b>\n\nHi Karl, thans for sharing your experiences around the OU.

A designer wants generate new problems to set a brief. A businessman wants to generate business ideas.\n\nIn terms of coming up with a new idea, prototyping it, implementing it, scaling it and each stage of that process requires a different kind of\u00a0<a class=\"alrptip\" href=\"http://www.designmethodsandprocesses.co.uk/2011/03/six-thinking-hats/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; background: transparent;\">thinking</a>.

We begin with donated space, profit from production and sales of our viable housing alternative and inject the profits into our own land commons. From there we offer space to those committed to expanding the commons - providing security to those who would expand our ability to secure a quality of life for all.\n\nAnyway that's general plan, there's also partnering with the elderly, farmers without heirs (or interested heirs), and those wishing to leave a positive legacy (most donations made in will - why not land?). The elderly are ill served in our present society, they have knowledge and assets and a need for community recognition and participation.

Back there I found a guy that told me about this movement: the biohacking. Basically, a bunch of tinkerers started to use their garages as biotechnology laboratories with the aim to make those biological technologies available to everyone.\n\nFrom that moment I started a path that led me to follow many movements and initiatives that are trying to create alternatives to existing power infrastructures.\n\nMy name is Damiano Avellino, I'm 24 years old. I\u2019m one of the founders of Fairbnb and of other non-profit initiatives that seek to create a more inclusive and fair society.\n\nDuring my years at the University, where I studied biotechnology, my curiosity was fed by great Professors during the day and by biohackers geeks on the internet during the night.\n\nMy first attempt to create a biohacker space dates at my freshman year, as you can imagine the excitement of my colleagues vanished due to the pressure of our studies and the difficulty of the journey.\n\nThe problem wasn\u2019t related to the goodness of the project, both other colleagues and professors seemed thrilled by the idea of having an open source lab for biotechnology. What stopped the initiative was the lack of support and guidance from existing organizations incapable of grasping and helping to fund new ideas.\n\nIn general, there\u2019s a tendency for new initiatives to struggle in the initial fundraising. It\u2019s easier to get funded if you are already big or active enough.\n\nIf you have applied for any grant, you know how competitive these things can be, and\n\nprobably you understand how the abundances of projects and the lack of funding\n\ntend to lower the diversity of the ecosystems and sometimes discourage innovative ideas - This doesn\u2019t apply to for-profit start-ups that can rely on other types of financial support (VC, Business angels, etc) -.\n\nAnyway, this part of my story is not what I\u2019m here to write about.\n\nI\u2019m here to write about emerging opportunities we have to finance bottom up initiatives, that are not exploiting, related to a viable strategy to transform existing sharing economy platforms in a mechanism to perpetually fund non-profit projects and grassroots initiatives.\n\nThis story is about an ongoing project that could pilot a new model of sharing economy that by succeeding could lead to the flourish of a new collaborative economy.\n\nFairbnb is in an early stage, we didn\u2019t launch the beta yet, but I\u2019m convinced for some reasons that I will briefly explain at the end, that it represents a huge opportunity to change the digital economy.\n\nWhy should we attempt to change the digital economy?\n\nWell, during the last ten years our economy has\u00a0been completely \u201cplatformed\u201d: the largest taxi company doesn\u2019t own any cars\u00a0(Uber), the world\u2019s biggest media owner creates no content (Facebook) and so on. In almost every sectors a single player with a \u201cplatform business model\u201d dominates.\n\nThere are two main problems with this:\n\n1) Platforms that succeed are the best for investors not for users\u00a0 (the growth is achieved thanks to massive investments), therefore are extractive, so Amazon takes % on the little bookstore sales, Airbnb takes % on your house, etc.\n\n2) Platforms tend to become a natural monopoly due to the network effect.\n\n(I\u2019m not mentioning how we lost our privacy and the possibility to have control over\u00a0the data that we generate because it could lead us too far)\n\nMy intention to create an alternative to this model grew with time and thanks to some precise experiences.\n\nI firstly became interested in platforms thanks to Eugenio Battaglia (Platform Design Toolkit) with whom I share the passion for biohacking.\n\nHe gave me the Pentagrowth report and fulfilled my head with other absorbing materials and thoughtful conversations that shaped my platform thinking.\n\nThe second crucial event happened last year when I was selected to participate in the Global Changemakers summit.\n\nThe rough idea that was floating in my mind, since probably a couple of years, had the chance to become a real project.\n\nThe idea to use part of the money generated by our online activities to redistribute wealth to local projects as an opposite model to the present one, that uses part of the wealth generated by our online activities to enrich billionaires, was simple and not probably not even that original.\n\nBut the fact that I had to attend a summit with 60 young activists all very influential in their communities and from all over the world gave me the chance to think concretely about a model for a particular platform that relies on crowdsourcing, and that could work.\n\nThe event took place in June 2016; there I brought the rough idea of a project called Solbnb (Solidaritybnb).\n\nSince then the project merged with two other initiatives, which were also trying to create an alternative to Airbnb in Amsterdam and Barcelona, under the name of Fairbnb. Nine co-founders from five different countries and with an age range that goes from 24 to 50 are working together to build the platform along with a growing community.\n\nThe platform with shared ownership and control will be non-extractive, inclusive and cooperative.\n\nThe peer2peer accommodation market produces every year more than 1.5 billion dollars of revenues (the extracted part).\n\nIf Fairbnb will be able to take even a little share of the market, an incredible number of non-profit initiatives could be funded.\n\nWe want to use as little as possible of the revenues to keep up the platform and give back the majority of this money to communities through local projects thanks to a crowdfunding-like mechanism.\n\nIf we succeed thousands biohackers spaces, social streets, art exhibitions, solidarity initiatives, refugees projects, etc. could be funded.\n\nAs Janella Orsi highlight in this article https://goo.gl/0XK6Nu\u00a0 \u201cThat rumored $20 billion company valuation relies largely on the loyalty of users. Like I said, thin air.\u201d\n\nYes.. a non-extractive P2P accommodation platform most likely is the best opportunity that we have to pilot a new model of sharing economy that could produce positive externalities at an unprecedented scale.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-05 20:40:47", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 03:40:21.756757", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1106, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 51.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12017, "user_id": 3500, "topic_id": 6063, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Thank you!</b>\n\nDear Noemi,\n\nThank you so much.

Then it will become a source of local enterprise from the sales of the filter and drops.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n<strong>Interesting read</strong>:\u00a0http://innovatedevelopment.org/2014/05/13/the-madidrop-an-affordable-easy-to-use-water-purification-tablet\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/xpsAJ9Bqcmo\n\nAccess to potable water is a severe and increasingly pressing issue for countries in the Global South. Due to a confluence of factors including overuse, population growth and climate change, an estimated two-thirds of the world\u2019s population will be living in water-stressed areas by 2025. One recent innovation that could potentially revolutionize water purification in poor, rural communities is the MadiDrop.\n\nThe MadiDrop is a porous ceramic disc that has been infused with silver or copper. When dropped in water, the tablet releases ionic silver or copper that strips away bacteria and pathogens to produce clean, drinkable water. Each tablet is capable of treating 10 to 20 litres of water for up to six months. The result is an affordable, easily distributable and long-lasting alternative for families who lack access to a safe, potable water source.\n\nThe MadiDrop is the second water treatment technology developed by PureMadi, an organization formed by a group of interdisciplinary students from the University of Virginia. Their first project was the creation of a ceramic water filter factory in South Africa. The filters use local labour, readily available materials (clay, sawdust and water) and are treated with a dilute solution of silver nano-particles that effectively filter out common waterborne pathogens. The PureMadi ceramic filters were designed to create a cheap and sustainable point-of-use water purification solution for low-income households. To date, they have been well-received and highly effective among families in Limpopo province, South Africa.\n\nThe impetus for the MadiDrop was to apply this successful model to create an even cheaper point-of-use water treatment technology. The MadiDrop can be used in a variety of water storage containers, and at only a few dollars per drop, can provide families with purified water for an extended period of time. Lab results look promising but extensive field testing is still required to determine whether the MadiDrop is a sustainable and culturally appropriate solution. With any luck, the MadiDrop will eventually be widely used to improve clean water access and curb the spread of waterborne diseases in low-income communities.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-31 22:10:07", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 04:35:47.792213", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 479, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4470, "user_id": 2638, "topic_id": 4437, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<strong>Hey there EdgeRyders,</strong>\n\nHow many of you are happy of yourselves and your surroundings? I think that change and evolution comes ultimately from dissatisfaction. Being constantly blissful only brings self sufficiency and platitude. That`s what I feel constantly, not able to stay put because standing still doesn`t get you anywhere. More than that, it makes one feel depressed over every minute that passes by without seizing it and squeezing whatever is available at the moment. One should constantly ask himself in the evening, as Benjamin Franklin did - <em>'What good have I done today?'</em>. That both helps the community and oneself.\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2312d69f08a074f432a76e0271351c518b5903ce.jpg\" width=\"265\" height=\"265\"><br>\n\nBut here I am rambling about all sort of frustrations, instead of introducing myself. My name is Iulian, a 26 y.o. man, living in Bucharest. This is not my home town, but whenever I meet new people, especially foreign, I like to tell a little story, in order to quickly put them in the right mood and mind state. I start with \"Well, I`m from the SE Europe, which is already talked about on western news channels as some sort of retrograde 3rd world country, belonging to the former soviet block.\"\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/693c7ba53cc8fc98857e0e52e1b500d9a81b9c39.jpg\" width=\"615\" height=\"409\"><br>\n\nI\u00a0then continue with a rather insinuating smile on my face that\u00a0<em>\"I`m from Romania, which, next to Moldova and Albania seems to provide some of the most frightening immigrants, even making documentaries and campaigns against our beggars, human trafficking individuals, thieves and overall organized crime masterminds.\"\u00a0</em>Then, I start to get to my favorite part, <em>\"I come from the region of Moldova, which is nationally talked about as the motherland of boozer drunkards. In Moldova, I am from Vaslui, which has been the poorest county in Romania for 8 years in a row. We were then surpassed by Botosani, but we quickly got on our feet and recovered the next year and have been undefeated champions ever since.\"</em>\u00a0You thought that was it? Nope. I would continue with <em>\"In Vaslui, I come not from the county 'capitol' city, but from a provincial town of Barlad. A town with all factories dismantled and sold for parts with the greatest unemployment rate in Romania. Yup, and you guessed it right, in Barlad, I didn`t live in the city\u00a0center, but at the outskirts, looking out of my\u00a0window towards the field.\"</em> Yep, most of my childhood friends have become drug dealers, pimps or online scammers, but also the high school I attended constantly got national Olympians at various subjects every year, people who work at CERN, Twitter or are revered lawyers, medics, etc. <strong>So provenience doesn`t mean anything.</strong> It just shows how a human being grows and develops, following their own dreams and desires towards self fulfillment.\n\n<u><strong>However, horizons need opening, perspectives need to be widened and hopes and dreams must be believed to be genuinely achievable.</strong>\u00a0</u>Especially when we`re talking about vulnerable groups - either concerning inequality in the job areas for women, children left stranded by parents working abroad, pupils being exposed to all sort of inadequate role models or simply individuals not having the same chances to be involved in projects.\u00a0\n\nThat brings us to today. Your questions regard what is worth <strong>investing time and energy</strong> into.\u00a0\u00a0The groups mentioned above must be supported into witnessing what are the current\u00a0possibilities\u00a0and how creativity and hard work can help bring projects to life. Time and energy should not all be non-profit. Perhaps I am a more practical / pragmatic kind of individual, hence the entrepreneur side of myself, but it takes money to make money. It takes something built in order to build and it takes great human beings to develop other great human beings. Believing in whatever\u00a0endeavor\u00a0one undertakes and treating it with passion will surely end up in success. Anyway, back on the subject of investing time and energy. Even the word 'investing' has a relative in ROI - the return of investment. Let us not develop projects for already or future corporate individuals to find a 'extra-curricular free time' activity, but something that has a reason to believe, that actively involves and helps others.\n\nFor example, some of the projects I am working on and am trying to develop:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><u><strong>Pay with answers </strong></u>- we already have a 1.5k people subscribed in a consumer panel who answer questionnaires from time to time and are\u00a0compensated for their time and effort. Imagine a 40 y.o. mother from Suceava, whose child, getting all A`s, is graduating\u00a0high school. She is\u00a0\u00a0proud, and would like her daughter to wear the best looking dress at her graduation party, to make her happy at least once. However, they can barely pay the bills, let alone offer that little piece of joy. What if there was a way that online shops could offer the possibility to customers to pay with cash for products or provide services for points which would be exchanged for products. She could answer questionnaires for a few weeks / months, in order to raise the points and then have the wonderful dress delivered at home.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><u><strong>A soup truck</strong></u> - Romanians are eager for fast food and have a tradition in soups. Obesity, however, started to be a problem within the public, so we thought to come up with a solution offering nutritious, healthy and diet food to fast paced individuals. Also, considering the fast developing trend of street food, the soup truck was the clear idea to create into a business. With a variety of recipes and both traditional and international tastes, a gourmet dish could be offered to clients in order for them to enjoy a fast and healthy meal. The social aid starts with the concept of 'Waiting soup'. Clients can purchase their own product and also pay for one 'waiting', so the poor and needy can come and have something to fill their\u00a0stomachs.</li>\n\n<li><u><strong>Tzolique </strong></u>- a business in which we can revitalize traditional rugs, made out of rags. This way, we can\u00a0recycle textiles, we can\u00a0\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/874da894bf54b776f5cd3dfe94c8388b66a37571.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"312\"><br>bring back the habit of doing rugs using the weaving looms, as our grandmothers used to do it. And in return for our wonderful elders, a percentage of the profits would be used for the benefit of nursing homes.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThese are just few of the ideas I have that can provide jobs, that can help recycle and help the needy without fearing the profit which will suggest to youngsters that their lifestyle can be enhanced by helping others. Being selfish is not a antonym of being selfless, but the two concepts can be easily\u00a0intertwined\u00a0for\u00a0better results for the community.\n\n<u><strong>Thus education through involvement and example is the best direction to invest time and energy.</strong></u>\n\nBeing a good educator is difficult, and truth be told, it seems like people have lost their patience. It is challenging to be able to pay the bills and at the same time to show interest into creating a good habitat for future generations. The most important challenge I seem to face at the moment is a lack of call to action. A lot of talking, complaining, being disappointed in certain aspects of one`s life without taking matters into one`s hands. There is little protesting attitude, little self-development mood and energy and a high a sense of ridicule that seems to fade away as one heads west. A lot of thinking about oneself and not the one within the group. We live in a socially disrupted context, with social media filled with selfies, fueling each ego.\n\nUnfortunately for the EdgeRyders initiative, my presence on social media is 0 (zero), with no photos,\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5e2f1616d46ac7ec86852a2de33844f011c48095.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"><br> no check-ins or comments, likes or others. However, despite that, I have a large group of intimate friends in all sort of domains, from art to constructions, from clothing designers to professional chefs, salesmen to priests, policemen to junkies. I, myself, am a specialist in branding and qual market research with connections in marketing, advertising, PR or consultancy.\n\nI can teach people to be anchored in reality while not wasting their creative nature or spiritual side. These do not exclude, but complete each other. I am an entrepreneur in a highly data centered business (market research) who is taking dancing/acting/painting classes, goes rafting and skydives, travels without a direction, an avid biker and curious into meditation. We are complex and we should discover as many facets as we can, or else depression is sure to get us through regret or disappointment of not trying this or the other. In case you haven`t figured it out yet, I graduated from sociology, with a high interest for social psychology, therefore the clear and loud conclusions. :)\n\nAlso, I don`t usually apply for things. My resume is kind of outdated because I don`t change jobs, all involvement in various projects was triggered by talking to those who wanted it done and showing some skills instead of letting them read a piece of paper. <strong>That is why EdgeRyders should know that this initiative to Spot The Future is really beneficial and there was a real need for it in Romania.</strong> I know there are more people of the sorts you are looking for but have not been brought together under the same entity in order to have a specific voice, to follow certain objectives to bring about genuine change. <u><strong>I would be deeply honored to take part and help as best as possible.</strong></u>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/158c21fa55a57c3cad2e55c3cb0566c3cdf0e077.png\" width=\"348\" height=\"500\"><br>One of the ideas of sharing your story starts with a project that has already been going on for several years, a wonderful initiative which my associate and I help organize each week: <strong>Fundatia Accumm invites you all every Wednesday at 19:00 for free of charge concerts of chamber music at Palatul Sutu (History Museum, University Square). </strong>If you can all wear a colorful scarf, we can get together and organise the first meetup. Of course, also, Roaba de Cultura, which can be found at the Pescarus entrance of Herastrau Park is also a fabulous place to meet.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo put it in a nutshell, it was a pleasure writing this post and I hope you take me into consideration for your part time because the awesome job will be fulfilled and I will be fulfilled by meeting people of your sorts.\n\nBest regards,\n\nIulian\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-22 23:15:39", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:25.880740", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1946, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 46.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 984, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 951, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We never got the time to go through the wealth of material from the big Edgeryders event in June as we have been in full speed ahead mode ever since. While doing research \u00a0for preparing the Policy Heroes track of \\#lote2 on Dec 6-9, I came across this video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/hFMMz4ADIGg\n\nIt brought to mind a recent conversation with someone who works within one of the European institutions during which I was asked \"Are not we the establishment enemy?\" I was reaching out and welcoming them to join us at \\#lote2, to come help flesh out the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/policy-heroes\">policy recommendations we collaboratively produced</a> as a result of thousands of conversations on and off the platform over the last year. The question took me by surprise. To me it is so obvious that we are all in a fight against inertia and impersonal distant forces. Just ask any one who has ever tried to change anything involving a large number of stakeholders. You just cannot do it alone. And why would you want to anyway when there are so many capable, hard working people with whom you could collaborate ? From whom you can learn and who in turn stand to learn from you?\n\n<blockquote>\"You don't want to create a\u00a0<strong>facebook</strong>\u00a0of democracy, you want an<s>\u00a0</s><strong>internet</strong>\u00a0of democracy\"</blockquote>\n\nBut above all else I would argue it is both in your best interest and part of your responsibility towards the future. Why? To be able to engage in collectively shaping the future we want to be a part of, we need to understand how our present institutions work. After having spent a year working at the Council of Europe it is clear to me that it is when you actually try to get specific, concrete things done that otherwise invisible obstacles, challenges and new questions that need answering surface. And a lot of the time unlocking inertia requires active collaboration and mutual exchange in an environment which does not penalise divergent thinkers, new approaches.

The commons boundaries are what's needed to prevent tragedies of the commons. I had proposed that treating Edgeryders' work as a commons resource will only work when having these boundaries ... this proposal still holds, even though I mixed up the definition of commons and their management institutions ...\n\nAbout using Economy App when there is money available: don't :) There's no problem in this case that it could solve. Just, the other case (absence of money) will probably be the more frequent one in Edgeryders, given that there are always more projects in their starting phases than mature ones. (For those interested in hacks: if money is available, Economy App can still solve how to distribute it to where it's most needed. Just offer the money as a product, say \"1000 EUR for 1000 EUR\". Then it's not necessarily paid as direct compensation for somebody's service to the project, but indirectly. For example: Bob provides social network services to Alice's project for 500 EUR; Alice provides the money product to Alberto; Alberto provides one day of consulting work to Chris; Chris provides a mountain bike for 500 EUR to Bob.)\n\nOn the tax issue in barter: Yep, there's some stuff to be worked out still. We intend to have a full manual for all European member states one day, but not for the beta phase. It seems that, in most states except Sweden where bartering is illegal, the taxman wil be ok if you both have an invoice for your business expense, and also an invoice for your business income (the mountain bike sale in this case). Both invoices will appear as if paid in cash, which is also legal. If the mountainbike was your private property though (meaning its resale does not have to be taxed) but you are a solo entrepreneur, it gets complex already: what document you need <em>now</em>?\n\nAbout using Economy App as a gift compensation system or not: Economy App would not be used to track and acknowledge who donated what product or service to whom. Let me try to explain more clearly the benefits of donations in barter (even though you understand the network barter concept's \"magic\" already). Say, you offer one day of consulting for 500 EUR and one broken phone for 100 EUR. You want to donate 200 EUR to Alice's project, means technically you order \"200 EUR worth of donation receipts\" from Alice's project account. You also happened to have contracted a freelancer for another web dev project on your blog; of this, 700 EUR are still due.\n\nThen in network barter, something like this would happen in one single trade, that is, simultaneously:\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>For Alberto</strong>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 400px;\">\n\n<thead>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Get</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Give</th>\n\n</tr>\n\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>Alice's donation receipts (152 EUR)\n\n(still due: 48 EUR)</td>\n\n<td>1d consulting (500 EUR)</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>web dev worktime (448 EUR)\n\n(still due: 252 EUR)</td>\n\n<td>broken phone (100 EUR)</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><strong>sum: 600 EUR</strong></td>\n\n<td><strong>sum: 600 EUR</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>For Alice's project</strong>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 500px;\">\n\n<thead>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Get</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Give</th>\n\n</tr>\n\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>blog post copywriting from Nadia (120 EUR)</td>\n\n<td>donation receipts to Alberto (152 EUR)\n\n(still due: 48 EUR)</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>video subtitling in Polish from Alexey (40 EUR)</td>\n\n<td>donation receipts to Chris (27 EUR)\n\n(still due: nothing)</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>video re-encoding fix from Matt (19 EUR)</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><strong>sum: 179 EUR</strong></td>\n\n<td><strong>sum: 179 EUR</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n(In addition to those mentioned, in practice such a trade would include 10-20 other people, and all would have such a little balanced box for income and expenses.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo the key attributes of Economy App as a donations management system are:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Donations are indirect</strong> (if you donate value, it does not mean you will work for the beneficiary project; instead you do what you're best in, and the project uses your donated value to cover its needs from others' projects and services; in contrast to the direct donations of time and resources from people like now, this is more flexible: we see donations used to purchase services and products from those who did <em>not</em> donate to this project, at least not as much as their services are worth).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Donations aggregate</strong> (extending on the above point: in contrast to direct donations we practice now in Edgeryders, with indirect donations it is possible for, say, 40 people to donate 100 EUR in barter each, and to \"pay\" a fulltime community manager from this for two months; while the community manager would not have been able to donate all that time herself without compensation; note how this allows to mix the \"nonmonetary kudos\" and \"material compensation\" modes that you proposed: now Alice can spend many small donations on a big chunk of work, or one big donation on many small chunks of work).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Donated amounts are unrelated to offer prices</strong> (if you offer one day of consulting for 500 EUR as a package, you don't need to donate a full day; it can be an arbitrary amount).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Donations are paid from any of the offers, not from specific ones</strong> (in the above example, the consulting and phone <em>together</em> paid for your donations and web developer <em>together</em>, but it's not possible to determine in more detail what paid for what; and you did not know before and could not influence that you paid with these two to get the other two; the only thing to look out for is that values match on both sides).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Donations are redeemed incrementally</strong> (a 200 EUR block is not used up in one instant, but is managed as a \"fluid\" product as we call it internally; this helps the network barter algorithm to close more trades).</li>\n\n<li><strong>Donations are redeemed on demand</strong> (if Alice's project gets 10.000 EUR in donations and simply cannot register enough orders for services and stuff to use them up, some remain unredeemed and that's ok; it's not like having 10.000 EUR donated cash on an account, so it should not feel like \"being in debt to others\" so much).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nGood point about the visibility of hourly rates. We did not think about this so far, but are kind of lucky to have a feature that hides the rates. It works by contributing to somebody's project and being compensated for it with a privately agreed rate, instead of making a public offer for selling a day's worth of your time.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-26 15:23:47", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:42.447184", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1247, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12558], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4418, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4385, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a20dd0da5b793ed8a833f12947c5c9e7062292f0.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"><br>\n\n<em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.7;\"><span>The Edgeryders team in Nepal! \\#Futuremakers</span></em>\n\nThe main news from us is that the work of getting \\#LOTE5 off the ground is now up and running.

La notion de cratos, donc de pouvoir me g\u00eane profond\u00e9ment. On a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu nombre de syst\u00e8mes se pervertir \u00e0 cause du pouvoir, comme le communisme. La d\u00e9mocratie a tenu le coup jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent car elle donne une illusion de participation au citoyen.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIl est grand temps de balayer nos erreurs pass\u00e9es et de mod\u00e9liser un nouveau syst\u00e8me dont le seul pouvoir possible serait un pouvoir sur soi-m\u00eame. Le leadership et l'entrepreunariat qui sont si chers \u00e0 nos dirigeants y auraient tout \u00e0 fait leur place, mais ils n'auraient plus le pouvoir d'en abuser.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMes travaux de ces huit derniers mois ont \u00e9t\u00e9 focalis\u00e9s sur la recherche d'une alternative. Cela m'a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e du site <a href=\"http://demopolitique.com/\">d\u00e9mopolitique</a>. Je l'ai pens\u00e9 tout d'abord comme un levier de changement. Son principe de base est d'appuyer le d\u00e9bat sur des sources sures et gratuites. Car un discours politique doit \u00eatre document\u00e9 et appuy\u00e9 sur des connaissances pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9, et non pas jouer sur les croyances et la manipulation comme cela est bien trop souvent le cas actuellement.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAu fil des rencontres, recherches et d\u00e9couvertes, le concept a \u00e9volu\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 une mod\u00e9lisation et un serious game auquel j'ai pens\u00e9 \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence Edgeryders et que j'ai pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lors d'une session o\u00f9 les personnes pr\u00e9sentes m'ont apport\u00e9 une aide plus que pr\u00e9cieuse :\u00a0<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/you-me-and-everyone-we-know/mission_case/edgecamp-unconference-report-sessions-about-demopolitique-a\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/you-me-and-everyone-we-know/mission_case/edgecamp-unconference-report-sessions-about-demopolitique-a</a>\n\nSon principe est de crowdmod\u00e9liser une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 alternative compos\u00e9e de micro et de macro communaut\u00e9es, locales ou virtuelles. En posant des questions simples aux citoyens, dans un environnement inspir\u00e9 des jeux ommunautaires, o\u00f9 les actions sont r\u00e9compens\u00e9es l\u00e0 aussi de mani\u00e8re locale ou virtuelle, il serait possible de mettre en relation les offres et les services, les connaissances et les d\u00e9sirs d'apprentissage...\u00a0Ce syst\u00e8me permettrait de mettre en relation des personnes tr\u00e8s particuli\u00e8res et de les inciter \u00e0 se regrouper en communaut\u00e9, mais aussi de mettre directement en relation les besoins et les services offerts par les citoyens.\n\nDe soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de service, que j'appelerais plut\u00f4t esclavagisme, nous passerions \u00e0 un soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9change, d'action et d'efficacit\u00e9.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIl est inutile de s'apesantir sur l'inefficacit\u00e9 probante de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 actuelle. Je ne prendrais qu'un exemple, la sant\u00e9. Comment justifier que des laboratoires travaillant sur des sujets aussi sensibles soient concurrents ? C'est impossible, et ce syst\u00e8me, outre les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 publique et d'abus de tout genre dont nous sommes bien inform\u00e9s, est inefficace.\u00a0Dans cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de services o\u00f9 chacun ne remplit bien souvent qu'un seul r\u00f4le, le g\u00e2chis d'\u00e9nergie humaine, de ressources, de comp\u00e9tences et de savoir-faire est gargantuesque.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLe monde est d\u00e9j\u00e0 en train de changer, et les dirigeants ne pourront rien y faire. La r\u00e9silience devient un mode de vie, et le capitalisme va peu \u00e0 peu s'assainir en changeant de mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique pour se tourner vers la base. Financer les bons projets plut\u00f4t que d\u00e9velopper un projet pour ensuite l'imposer.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCe changement n'est plus qu'un histoire de temps. Ca tombe bien, tout s'acc\u00e9l\u00e8re, et je ne serais gu\u00e8re surpris de voir des changements profonds dans les mois \u00e0 venir.

You were then awarded an additional 12000 Euros for this from OBE county enterprise funds. You did the fundraising in collaboration with or under the organisationional umbrella of Foroige and now Foroige is the organisation within which your inititive lives. This is problematic because you argue that their policies and direction are unproductive. You give two examples\n\n1. As part of the initiative you aligned (what does that mean- got different youth caf'e to sign up to the platform/ formally agree to collaborate? Built the platform? Something else?) a social media-based project to enable self-organised suicide awareness and prevention efforts of young people, free of cost. Foroige as an organisation objected to the initiative on the grounds that it would make children vulnerable to being approached or accessed by \"the wrong kind of people\" (how ?). You think that this person's objection has something to do that Foroige is somehow tied to the RCC in Irish Youth Organisations.\n\n2. The project has been awarded an additional 4000 Euros from a suicide awarenss and prevention group that wished you to produce and distribute leaflets and stickers. Your objection to this is that is might be counterproductive instead contributing to more suicides \"\u00a0 jung's enantiodromia, a things completion by its opposite, like 'don't think about a blue elephant'.\u00a0\n\nInstead you want to organise an event that would gather a broad range of stakeholders and expertise on the psychology of suicide, a creative communication project that focuses on the experiences of those affected by loss through suicide in the local community, as well as develop a model for long term initatives and\u00a0how to sustain them and present it at the main event. These\u00a0include a year long program of activities in an environment that enables the entire community to be involved in and contribute to suicide prevention.\n\n\u00a0So if I've understood the above correctly Im curious \u00a0which of the initiatives is up and running \u00a0or closest to being set up and how would you see others, e.g. individual Edgeryders members contributing to it?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-23 12:29:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:37.183136", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 486, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10379], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29360, "user_id": 2394, "topic_id": 5358, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Distributing data without (visible) peer to peer / block chain</b>\n\nI did a bit of thinking about <a href=\"http://jimmytidey.co.uk/blog/building-a-better-twitter/\">why Diaspora failed</a>.

First of all, thanks @ilariadauria for taking the time to share the budget. The transparent attitude is great.\n\nThat said, I think the budget could be improved \u2013 also in the sense of making it more consistent with the CheFare project, at least the parts that I myself helped write. The idea is that we <em>already</em> have some residencies, and the CheFare grant might be dedicated to (1) making the unMonastery <strong>sustainable</strong> and (2) making the unMonastery <strong>scale</strong>. I don't think I have to argue that what [immaginoteca] calls \"the lack of a clear economic model\" is possibly the biggest question mark hanging over the whole operation. Achieving sustainability in Matera might involve activities to group under headings like:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>increasing the unMonastery self-sufficiency </strong>(starting a serious garden to grow food, investing in insulation and solar to reduce energy consumption and generate some of it outside the grid etc.)</li>\n\n<li><strong>developing some of the \"first batch activities\" into prototypes</strong> for marketable goods and services. For example, [Marc]'s solar tracker could potentially become a sellable kit (product) or a small company that installs solar trackers for clients (service). Doing this requires some benchmarking, tests, coaching etc. This could be done in collaboration with Sviluppo Basilicata and its incubator next door.</li>\n\n<li><strong>developing the unMonastery's fundraising muscle</strong> for the activities that are to stay nonmarket. This is closest to the \"lay mendicant order\" originally dreamed up, and would involve recruiting someone to do the fundraising.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAs for scaling, that means essentially telling the tale \u2013 having Ben and others wander Europe spreading the unword, looking for possible partners in starting other unMonasteries, building up a reservoir of candidate unMonasterians etc. \n\nAt the moment, essentially all the money is spent on more residencies. I understand the logic, but there is a serious risk that, after 12 months, people will complain that \"hey, one year is not enough to get this thing off the ground!\" and then you are back into a narrative of dependency.

If you use\u00a0<em>dynamic</em>\u00a0microphones (cheaper, tougher etc.) you get the added bonus of a much shorter range (<a href=\"http://www.videomaker.com/article/14111-which-is-best-a-dynamic-microphone-or-a-condenser-microphone\">explanation</a>, based on video production rather than quake relief, but the engineering principles are the same). \u00a0Shorter range means a dramatic reduction in ambient noise. Sound sources that are not close to the microphone and directly facing its membrane will not be picked up by a dynamic microphone. This is why the (hi-res) 2000 EUR microphones are only ever used in soundproof recording studios, and even major stars sing into 100 EUR Shure SM58s.\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/u/trythis\">@trythis</a>: you seem to have an amazing network, and you are very generous with sharing your contacts, for which you have my personal thanks and, I am sure, those of the community at large. The reason why we may seem hesitant to follow up on your advice and reach out to the people you are pointing us in the direction of (just in this thread: the delay tolerant networks crowd and Europe Aid) is, as far as I am concerned, the following: these are high quality connections, and need a lot of maintenance. It's not OK to shoot an email in their direction and then forget about it; if you engage, you have to be ready to follow up, again and again, and to show proper respect for the people involved and their project. If those people get really wired up and start writing you ten email a day, you have to reply to ten emails a day, until mutual trust has had time to harden. Doing otherwise would be irresponsible, as it would deplete\u00a0<em>your</em>\u00a0social capital. Therefore, engaging properly entails a significant coordination cost; it needs to be done wisely, in full awareness that a team like Nepal's can probably handle only one newly opened such connection every month or so.\u00a0\n\nThis is not to discourage you. On the contrary, I repeat, I think you are doing great work, and doing it very generously.

In Greece there is already many cooperatives, especially created as a result of the economic crisis, either under a legal form or remaining informal, and we want to support their networking as well as to expand the network through creating new cooperative initiatives.\n\nOne of the tools to connect those and at the same time to untie ourselves from the banking system is alternative currency networks and FairCoin is already doing this on a global level. However the currency is just a tool, what is most important is the vision and the values that incorporate the efforts. In Thessaloniki, we started quite recently but there is already some places that joined and we hope to see more of them joining very soon. In Greece there is more places in Athens and the island of Crete, where FairCoin is further connected to the local currency of Herakleion. @Noemi you can find a global directory with all the places using FairCoin <a href=\"https://use.fair-coin.org/\">here.</a>\n\n@WinniePoncelet this is certainly not an easy task, especially when the effort is being made on a global scale and you are trying to create change in a global scale. But we hope that cooperation can help with all the progress. The biggest challenge I see is trust and empowerment, people to trust each other and believe that collectively they can change things. So trust to each other and trust to collective power, rather than being disconnected and antagonistic. From so many sides we are being trained to not trust each other and our collective power, but I believe that culture is gradually changing and people are becoming more inclined to create communities and cooperate. Technology and to a certain extent the economic crisis have supported that.\n\n@Simonedb I agree with you that it is extremely important to remain open to other ideas and projects, and this is why we were so happy to participate at the Edgeryders workshop in Thessaloniki where we met this amazing community of people! At the same time, it is also important to have clear values and objectives, so that people trust you. So openness, cooperation and values can go a long way and can bring very creative results, especially on a large or global scale.\n\nI invite people interested in our efforts to visit <a href=\"https://fair.coop/\">FairCoop</a>\u2019s website and if you wish to be more actively involved or have ideas to share, please leave a message or join our telegram groups which we use for networking and communication, by sending an e-mail to: coop@fair.coop!\n\nPS: @Noemi, I don\u2019t think we have met before, do you mean the Festival of Solidarity and Cooperative Economy in Athens? I have been there, but since I live in Thessaloniki I am not part of the organizing team. However our group here is connected with the people in Athens and also people organizing the festival.

In fact, for the unconference part of our upcoming <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/conference\">conference</a>, I'm using the couch of a local resident of Strasbourg!! :)\n\nMy experience with the people in the community was and is great!!! I made a lot of\u00a0acquaintances and friends from all the world (America, Europe, Asia and Africa). With them I shared countless stories and\u00a0laughs. We learn from each other our cultures and traditions. We heared and felt about our problems, hopes and all those feelings that accompany us on our journey as human beings. My exchange with them was basically based on sharing and respect .. a tale about basic human decency ..\n\nMy experience with the way that the decisions are taken by the people at the \"management\" side of the community .. it was another tale,\u00a0but a tale where there was disrespect regards\u00a0the value of our voices and opinions as a members of the community .. and this disrespect for me is clearly a behavior in the line with the lack of basic human decency. \u00a0One day, without our consultation, in an arbitrary way, we were \"sold\" .. \u00a0our community from being organized as a non-profit structure built with our sharing and money donations, \u00a0became a for-profit organization, a\u00a0\u00a0B Corp I agree, but anyway a for-profit organization and nobody asked us if we want that .. at this moment I was involved with other people about this fact (the results of this involvement is another long tale worth of discuss in another thread!),\u00a0and some of the points that I was arguing with them were:\n\n*****\n\nI do not disagree with people trying to make money to have a decent life. In our society we all agreed (implicitly or explicitly) that money is our medium of exchange, so we need money to live. So, if the \u201cmanagement\u201d is needing the money to maintain the site and to maintain themselves (assuming that they are spending all their working time to the site), for sure they should seek the honest alternatives to get that money. But, from my point of view, to the thing that the management haven't right is is to undertake the implementation of a solution in an arbitrary and nontransparent way. Because, although its true that they initially organized the site, the current success of the site isn't of them, but belongs to the volunteer work of all of us (without pay, as opposed to management), and through this volunteer work (which accounts for most of the work that makes the site successful), we all implicitly become site's shareholders. And as shareholders, we have the right to decide the fate of our community, i.e. be consulted when the management want to make a decision that affects our future\n\nWhat has been happening these days in the community of Couchsurfing functions as a sort of replica of our wider environment, our society. We can see that bad things are constantly happening in our society, and what is worse, our society (we) passively accepts this things. When something bad happens, if we're lucky and the bad thing get some coverage, then a small storm of protests is formed. But, as in the short term, this bad thing does not affect the status quo of most of society, this initial storm of discontent is not going to be more than a small shower with no real consequences.\u00a0I guess that the initial problem that produce this behavior is a mix of our conformist education, our lack of vision in the medium and long term, and of course our own personal comfort. People in general moves when reaches an extreme situation, but while they are thinking that their situation will improve or at least remain the same, it is really difficult to motivate them to action, although in the medium and long term this very lack of action likely will lead to a worse situation.\u00a0The other problem of course is our lack of structures to organize and coordinate the response of the society in a way that promotes an effective action, while at the same time prevents the concentration of power that inevitably lead to abuse, as well as the apathy and loss of valid voices tired of the crying and fighting for power.\n\n*****\n\nWhat was happening at Couchsurfing was clearly reflected in the following article: \"<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/30/humbug/\">A Billion Dollars Isn\u2019t Cool. You Know What\u2019s Cool? Basic Human Decency</a>\" \u00a0 .. where it is stating basically the same thing .. in the new economy that is arising (that could be named \"cognitive capitalism\"), the new business are being built with our social effort and values, with bits of our own lives the 24 hours a day\u00a0.. with our pictures, thinking, comments, tags, friends and so on .. and we are not having voice about how all this value created by our effort is managed. Worst! we are not shapping how the incredible technology we have at hands (mostly arised from research paid with public money) is being used in the society .. the crude economic interests guided by short-term financial results is shapping its use.\n\nSo, I'm fully agree with the mindset framed by \"mine become ours\" .. but I want fair play .. I want a politic and economic context that is also framed by \"mine become ours\" .. not by \"yours become mine\" \u00a0as that sadly permeates the economic forces dominating our current context .. for this reason I belong to Edgeryders and for this reason I'm inviting you to join, talk and act about these issues at the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/living-together-session/mission_case/implementing-real-social-project-case-european-commission\">living together</a> session\u00a0\u00a0...\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-06 19:13:51", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 13:09:33.224625", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1059, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 2380.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14503, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1473, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Degeneracy of IPR</b>\n\nI was aware of the problem, but I guess I am not typical.

This is just one more effect of the \"extremism\" of the (mostly American) media industry, as explained by Clay Shirky in the video below.\n\nThe map is really useful, thank you!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/GsxvGL5hJgE\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-02 09:16:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:21.896369", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 251, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15370, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3756, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>I cannot attend</b>\n\nBut I have more or less done my homework on curation standing in for Ben.

C'\u00e8 una linea sottile in cui queste due sensazioni si toccano e si attraversano. La sfida verso s\u00e8 stessi, dal mio punto di vista viene sempre prima, comunque; prima di tutto stare, o sentirsi,\u00a0da solo in qualunque luogo, anche senza comodit\u00e0 e\u00a0immersi nella natura, oppure semplicemente\u00a0rinchiusi dentro s\u00e8 stessi anche in un contesto di apparente socialit\u00e0 allenta alcune tensioni, ma ne produce altre a livello psicologico. Qualunque sia l'isolamento che una persona che fa una scelta di isolamento decide di vivere, lo fa nei confronti di quello che offre il contesto in cui \u00e8 abituato a vivere, del quale si vuole provare a spogliare, a liberare.\n\nOgnuno di noi quando fugge, o semplicemente se ne va, oppure resta e si ribella ( a seconda delle et\u00e0 i tipi di ribellione possono anche cambiare, ma sussiste la scelta in s\u00e8)\u00a0lo fa perch\u00e8 non si ritrova in quello che la realt\u00e0 in cui vive la propria esperienza, offre.\n\nLa vera sfida, anche laddove comunque qualcosa c'\u00e8 come ricorda Alberto riferendosi al contesto che garantiscono le istituzioni che\u00a0governano ad esempio l'arrivo di fondi finalizzati a non fare spopolare le zone montane\u00a0o a far continuare alcune tradizioni popolari, \u00e8 il voler uscire dalla propria esperienza per provare nuovi paradigmi, senza pregiudizi, con l'apertura mentale di chi sa che per forza di cose la propria esperienza \u00e8 cos\u00ec piccola e unica che ovunque ce ne sono altre che lo aspettano e che, potenzialmente, sanno o possono accoglierlo meglio.\n\nDa questo punto di vista mi piace ricordare la complessa semplicit\u00e0 di J.Krishnamurti che affermava proprio la necesssit\u00e0 di\u00a0un cambio di paradigma come modalit\u00e0 di evitare di restare chiusi dentro a steccati preconcetti siano essi di carattere politico, religioso, sociale evitando i guru o le vie semplici guidate da altri che non siano s\u00e8 stessi; o Bruce Lee che vinse le chiusure del mondo orientale nei confronti della condivisione dei segreti della propria arte, inventandone una sua che voleva insegnare a tutti....\n\nVoglio ricordarvi per questo una splendida canzone di Eddie Vedder per salutare con gioia la voglia di cambiare nei confronti della propria societ\u00e0 di riferimento....lasciando stare come \u00e8 finita perch\u00e8 non era certo come il protagonista voleva che finisse...solo per assaporare insieme il profumo della libert\u00e0 di scegliere....\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqcd-YI7WDM\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqcd-YI7WDM</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-05 20:44:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:30.771365", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 471, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 579, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 546, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2017-06-16 12:10:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:01.596101", "deleted_at": "2017-08-01 15:32:17.578556", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19956, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3231, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Moved this to the Public Speaking group</b>\n\n... where it belongs!\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-03 14:28:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:51.158257", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 15, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9997, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1684, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>What does the RSA do?</b>\n\nHi Gaia!\n\nHow are you?

It makes sense since individually each NGO is really isolated. While the funding is creating competition and some perverse effects in protecting specialist areas, the platform mentality is starting to grow. It's never easy though, as you're hinting, Inge, in the trust issues and the apparent monopoly position of a big player vs much smaller organisations. Specific issue focus has been successful here: different women's groups lobbying parliament during the consultation on the constitution. I think a shared focus of interest and reward can stimulate that collective spirit: an earlier draft of this included monitoring and evaluation - perhaps a shared pool of monitoring data could stimulate collaboration? And build the call for open data...</span>\n\n<span>For volunteering, personally I think it's about the meaningfulness of that volunteering: make that clear and positive vibes of volunteering will flow! So, the focus suggested on social media, promotion and communication stream between NGOs looks great.</span>\n\nI'm trying to learn how all this is working here too!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-15 18:29:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:51.736246", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 247, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16198, "user_id": 30, "topic_id": 1683, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>How good to see you here, Mr. Vickers</b>\n\nSo I have a couple of questions.\n\nAnd these are things on my own mind, for which you are the foil, rather than questioning your work, if you see what I mean.\n\nSo it's occurred to me that the \\#Collapsonomics thing is moving towards being a little cottage industry - there's an Opera, http://toxicdreams.at/collapsonomics/\n\nthere's going to be a book eventually, there's this course we're doing at Schumacher - but here's the question.\n\nIs it sustainable and/or ethical to be making a living teaching people how to manage not being able to make a living?

Throughout our exploration exercise asking how you interact with new arrivals or people already living in a space, we refrained from applying the consecrated labels from the policy field, particularly to capture a fresh view outside the institutional constraints; we have designed this so that everybody feels welcomed to share their experiences, whether their part of a majority or a minority of any kind.\u00a0</em> The advent of far right political movements and the wide support they benefit from, even in solid democratic societies, is deeply worrying. Most often, the targets of this rhetoric are migrants, foreigners, ethnic minorities, those people that \u201cdo not belong\u201d to the \u201cdominant\u201d culture in a society. What does this mean in today\u2019s globalized, extremely mobile world, when we talk about<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_European_Union\"> European citizenship</a>, when London is home to more than<a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/270-nationalities-and-300-different-languages-how-a-united-nations-of-workers-is-driving-london-forward-6572417.html\"> 270 nationalities</a>, or when the people we call second generation immigrants are in fact our peers, born, raised and taught in the same language, and sometimes are as much citizens as the rest of nationals? More than a mere movement of labor force driven by surplus and demand, migration has a cultural dimension that includes the mentality, ways of being and living between newcomers and host communities (<a href=\"http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/socialpolicies/socialcohesiondev/source/GUIDEMIGRANTS_EN.pdf\">CoE\u2019s Guide on Migrants and their descendants</a>..). The categorizing of individuals, even on a legal basis, into migrants or foreigners (see the <em>extracomunitari </em>in Italy, <em>\u00e9trangers</em> in France, <em>Ausl\u00e4nder</em> in Germany) most often enforces an \u201cus\u201d/ \u201cthem\u201d dichotomy. When translated into human relations, these categories can dangerously result in a culture of stereotyping, hostility or exclusion. Even what was intended as a positive outlook on migrants or minorities \u2013 integration policy \u2013 is now criticized for bearing stigma and normativity, and unequal power relations. Some authors argue that given the multitude of lifestyles within a society, there is in fact no national identity to stand as baseline for shared norms and behaviors, such that the integration process is transformative in itself, it is a creative exchange that builds into a new \u201cus\u201d (CoE 2010, pp.65-70). Looking into this dynamic and learning to overcome not just marginalization, but also individualization in constructing identities, is at the heart of this Edgeryders Living Together campaign. ---------- -&gt; Go back to mission page: <span><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/living-together/rules-space\">The rules of the space</a></span> -&gt; Or if you\u2019re ready to share your insights with the community, <span><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/node/add/mission-case?gids%5B0%5D=481\">Start this mission now</a></span>!

But I find that it is more general than mine. And that my one can be seen as a step forwards in the line indicated by the Federico\u2019s one.\n\nIn fact: the Federico\u2019s question \u201c<em>How do we mobilize to obtain a change of the processes of caring thanks to the web\u2026\u201d, </em>\u00a0could already have an answer in the way my question is formulated and in the working hypothesis on which it is based (and that, in my view, are also the OpenCare working hypotheses).\n\nIn short, if the general question would: \u201c<em>how do we mobilize to obtain a change of the processes of caring thanks to the web</em>\u201d, we could state that our paper (and the whole OpenCare research) has been developed on the basis of 2 +1 working hypothesis:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>(first hypothesis):</em> it is possible to create a (care-oriented) digital space of possibilities where different kinds of self-organized (care-oriented) conversations can emerge and evolve towards (care-oriented) conversations for action.</li>\n\n<li><em>(second hypothesis):</em> it is possible to embed in the digital space of possibilities some specific affordances, thanks to which (care-oriented) conversations have <em>higher probabilities</em> to emerge and evolve towards conversations for action.</li>\n\n<li><em>(third hypothesis):</em> the experiences in open systems and the hackers approach, considered in a radical way, offer innovative guidelines also when the care issue is concerned.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nGiven these hypotheses, and given the prototype of care-oriented space of possibilities OpenCare realized, the paper core research specific question is: What can we learn from the first months of experience? Are the 2+1 hypotheses verified?\n\nIn order to do answer this question, OpenCare team observes how full scale prototype od space of possibilities worked, considering: (1) the dynamic of the conversations and (2) the role of the space of possibilities and its affordance in making that dynamic happen.\n\nThe paper presents these observations and verify the the assumed hypotheses validity. \u00a0\n\n<em>What do you think?</em>\n\n<strong>Theoretical background</strong>\n\nThis one, in my view, is the most difficult point. We must be (and to show to be) interdisciplinary. But, at the same time, every paper should have a theoretical core and utilize a set of theoretically grounded conceptual tools. \u00a0Therefore, where could our theoretical background be?\n\n<em>Ethnography. </em>Could ethnography be our main theoretical background (as, I think, it is for the whole Open Care research)? Have we possibility to use it at this scale of observatons? Could we refer to both the digital ethnography and the traditional \u201cphysical\u201d one? Who could take the lead on that?\n\n<em>Language/action perspective.</em> Writing the abstract I used the notions of \u201cconversations\u201d and, implicitly, of \u201cconversation typologies\u201d.

We would like to pay someone to help us with booking travel and accommodations for members of the Edgeryders team:</strong>\n\n<strong>Are we allowed to do this under the grant agreement, and if so does it fall under direct or indirect costs? </strong>\n\nYou have two possibilities<em> (this answer will match the previous one I gave to Noemi)</em>:\n\n- Either you can pay for this service under the indirect cost budget (because there is no mention of such a position in the GA - Description of Action).\n\n- Or, if Edgeryders doesn't plan to use the staff costs reimbursed by the EC to directly pay salaries of the staff working on the project, ER may further use this budget for other purposes.\n\nIn that case, the further use of funds will not be taken into consideration by the European Commission for reports nor audits (free of use). The counterpart is that you need to prove the costs related for the staff working on the projects (as you will have to do for all the staff declared for the project), by keeping time-sheets and work contracts.\n\n<em>Example: if you are declared on the project, but paid on other source / already paid by another contract, you can on the one hand\u00a0use the EU grant Edgeryders\u00a0received to reimburse your time on the project and\u00a0to cover for other participants' expenses. But in order to be able to do this, you will have on the other hand\u00a0to report to the EC only the time you spent working\u00a0on the project by providing time sheets and work contracts.</em>\n\n<strong>Is this expense to be covered from the budget for travel?\u00a0\u00a0 </strong>\n\nNO - travel budget is only meant to pay for the fares, not for the service\n\n<strong>Do you have a model contract and or invoice for this kind of service? </strong>\n\nNO - the contract is to be made as Edgeryders' would usually do, and comply with the British law, since it is registered in the UK. Alberto previously showed me a model which might also be suitable for this purpose. (To be confirmed by a lawyer, in my opinion).\n\n<strong>2. We would like to award small grants to some participants who make significant contributions to the project:</strong>\n\n<strong>Can we run a competition?</strong>\n\nThis point is still to be confirmed by our project officer.\n\n<strong>And give away cash prizes under the grant agreement? If so, what paperwork and information about recipients is needed?</strong>\n\nNO - you are not allowed to distribute funds as such to other persons.\n\n<strong>If we cannot give away cash prizes, can we pay small amounts of money for specific deliverables to \"competition\" participants? If yes, do these fall under direct or indirect costs?</strong>\n\nNO - you cannot 'redistribute' some of your tasks to other persons (if I understood well what you meant by \"specific deliverables\"). However, you may reward their contribution by buying them goods/services, which could be eligible as the needs listed under the \"other goods and services\" budget costs. Or by using the indirect costs budget category, which will not be audited.\n\n<strong>How can we best go about covering the travel costs for a lot of people not officially on the research team without risking breaching the grant agreement? Is there an upper limit to how many people we can reimburse for their travels to our events? What information/ documents do we need to have prepared before, during and after the event to be on the safe side?</strong>\n\nThere is no limitation as to covering the travel costs, but we recommend that for each funding you summarize information about the beneficiary, the context, the purpose, the expected impact of the travel (by filling a form). This will be useful in case of justification for reports.\n\nBest,\n\nLuce\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-24 09:34:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:51.134395", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 715, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24846, "user_id": 33, "topic_id": 1345, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Cultural conditioning</b>\n\nKalimera Chara,\u00a0\n\nI like your phrase: \"I would prefer to have half the theoritical knowledge and double the practical\". Very nicely put!\u00a0\n\nI do not think there is an easy way to answer your question about how feedback should be given to both employers and employees. In my experience you can only do this effectively by talking to people at their own level and this is only possible if you analyze the situation to the prism of the respective culture. As we discussed with Lyne as well, it takes a life time to learn how to optimally communicate with people. In your situation, I would imagine that there the <a href=\"http://geert-hofstede.com/greece.html\">Power Distance Index</a> is fairly high, meaning there's a well-established hierarchy and messages weasel their way through the chain of command. I can imagine that getting a message across demands its fair share of effort and you have yo fight your way past people's egos just to say what you want to. Correct me if I'm wrong.\u00a0\n\nSince I am not particularly familiar with your situation I will provide a generic answer, a theoretical one, which nonetheless can be translated and applied very efficiently in every-day situations. I would dare to say that the need for recognition, inherent in every human being lies at the heart of every interpersonal conflict. The sociologist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Honneth\">Axel Honneth</a>\u00a0covers it extensively and Fukuyama also devised his own form of <em>thumos</em> and called it Megalothymia. It's a theoretical approach, but bear with me :)\n\nIn Denmark, this way of communicating is standardized, the paedagogical approach is used in every layer of society from Kindergarten to jobinterviews at Vestas and even in political debates. The trick is to ALWAYS start out by underlining the other person's positives (maybe they made a good point or said something that could inspire you, etc.) and then you ease into the critique points. It's a part of their nature here and it works splendidely.\u00a0<em>Caressing</em> the other's ego creates an opening for discussion and makes them want to listen to you. This sounds very harsh and manipulative but basically, for me it's understanding human nature.\u00a0\n\nWhile I was in Berlin doing my internship, my employers were most often than not open to insights and feedback but you had to catch them in the right moment and formulate it in a certain way before the communication bore fruit. I also experienced a couple of times that I unwillingly challenged my bosses' power position despite my good intent and while trying to do my job well. It's very important to be self-aware and find out when you press other people's buttons just by meaning well.\u00a0\n\nDepending on your status in the organization you work in, you can shape the discourse by e.g. proposing a weekly or monthly feedback session. Try to initiate a meeting with the goal of opening the channel of communication between leaders and subordinates. It will be hard at first but I would imagine that setting an agenda of introducing a list of problem areas could get the discussion started. Set off with simple organizational evaluation patterns/forms. Find out who's happy/unhappy in the organization and why. How can those issues be resolved? etc.\u00a0This sounds a little rigid but it's necessary to employ a method that suits the respective organization and culture.\u00a0\n\nAre you the only one who has conflicts with your superiors or are your collegues in the same situation? This is important to know if you want to make headway. If I had a problem with my superiors, I would try getting some one-on-one time with them and calmly formulating my worries using nonviolent communication and telling them how I feel. \"I love my job and that is why I wish to improve my work experience, and I need your help / I feel that you sometimes undermine my capabilities / I don't feel appreciated and therefore can't do my job as well as I wish\" and so on. And then ask THEM to offer a resolution to the problem before you utter your own solutions.\u00a0\n\nI don't know if this helps at all. Maybe Alberto could be able to give you some better advice on the issue, considering he's much more experienced than I am.\u00a0\n\nThank you for recommending Giacomo, I added him as well.\u00a0\n\nAnd thank you for the McQuinn link :D I'm going to have to consider posting my thesis on Edgeryders seeing that so many people are interested in the topic.\n\nNa se kala ;)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-22 11:29:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:17.513086", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 834, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17131], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31080, "user_id": 87, "topic_id": 1298, "post_number": 44, "raw": "<b>Good night!</b>\n\nLooking like\u00a0a great start Nadia!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-10 22:47:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:50.926038", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11138], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19275, "user_id": 14, "topic_id": 1712, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>People vs. organizations</b>\n\nHi Alberto,\n\nI see your point - often individuals and groups of people working independently of organisations can be highly effective. However, I would also suggest that the key is for funders to ensure that the intent of people is very closely aligned with the objectives of a particular intervention. It's easier to define the intent and interests of an organisation than an individual - usually non-profit organisations have a written constitution, aims and objectives etc.\n\nIt seems to me that we're running up against two ways of understanding how intervention approaches work:\n\n(1) Get the model right - the people don't matter so much.\n\nThis way of understanding presumes that interventions are an organisational matter.\n\n(2) Get the people right - the model for the intervention doesn't matter so much.\n\nThis way of understanding supposes that the right people, well intentioned and focussed, will do some good, with whatever specific intervention model is to hand.\n\n<em><strong>I believe in neither of these narratives!</strong></em>\n\nHere's my sugestion:\n\n(3) Get a \"good enough\" model (one that's reasonably effective and flexible) and get \"good enough\" people. (I am an example of a \"good enough\" person - I'm not a great manager, nor am I the most knowledgable technical expert, but I have a wide range of awareness and knowhow, leadership skills, and ability to get the job done.) <u><strong>NOW MAKE SURE THAT THE INTERESTS AND IMPULSES OF THE PEOPLE DRIVING IT, AND THE INTERESTS AND INTENT OF THE INTERVENTION ARE VERY CLOSELY ALIGNED</strong></u>.\n\nThis alignment is crucial to success. Many, many projects crash because the people running them are \"really quite interested\" in their intent. That's not good enough - projects need them to be <em><u>totally dedicated to the project's success</u></em>. Funders can only acheieve this by understanding well how the particular project dovetails with people's career plans, other interests and jobs, hobbies, family life and professional development.\n\nI believe that this alignment is one of the things that has been crucial to Access Space. My portfolio career as a socially engaged artist, researcher and lecturer align very well with the best interests of Access Space. So I, personally, am<em><u> absolutely determined</u></em> that Access Space succeeds - not just for its own sake, but ALSO because it helps me progress my personal agendas.\n\nI have seen many projects come to grief because the key people driving them have agendas other than the success of the project in play. Their interests gradually diverge from the interests of the project, and the whole thing starts to fall apart. <em>(Were they really interested in regenerating this community? No - they were intersted in building a career in community regeneration!)</em>\n\nHope this helps!\n\nJames\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-25 13:55:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.448845", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 503, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10303, "user_id": 653, "topic_id": 1309, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I'm not enough of an economist to comment on the Euro and how it's going to pan out. To me, some of what's going on in Greece and Italy looks awfully familiar (albeit less terrifying) from many of the past examples Naomi Klein gives in the Shock Doctrine \u00a0- and that goes for the UK, too.\n\nStill, that's not what I'm here to talk about.\n\nHaving spent most of my life living in the UK and a bit of it living in France and Germany, I'm terrified that we're drifting away from Europe in this country. This isn't just something that's restricted to the right wing of politics; while they rail against Eurocrats imposing regulation from afar, lefties are battling against health reform to save a 60-year-old system. France and Germany seem to do just fine without a centralised Health Service, and that doesn't seem to be something anyone's willing to explore.\n\nThe main narrative we get about the EU in the UK, though, does come from the rightwing press, and it's inevitably one that attacks the EU for doing well-intentioned things. How we've got to a point where human rights legislation is a serious point of controversy is beyond me, as are things like the Working Time Directive (I personally don't particularly want to be flown by a pilot or operated on by a doctor who hasn't been conforming to something like that for a good long time before we cross paths). I can't imagine that most people, having thought about these things for five minutes, would be strongly against the European regulations - after all, if Abu Hamza doesn't have human rights because we don't like him, why should you have any?\n\nWhat really bothers me is that collective European institutions arepossibly the only bodies we have that are capable of standing up to big (often US-based) multinationals which abuse their power. It might take a while to grind into action, but it's taken on Microsoft and will probably get around to the social networks sometime soon; it's gradually beating mobile phone operators into submission over roaming charges and doing a whole raft of other consumer protection stuff. This isn't stifling business or innovation or any of the other Republican-candidate bullshit, it's making the world a better, safer, cheaper place for ordinary citizens to live in, and no-one seems to care that it's coming from Europe.\n\nI've had some amazing opportunites thanks to the EU - like the ERASMUS programme, low-cost air travel, free passage across borders to wherever my girlfriend happens to be, you name it. I'm glad this site exists - hopefully it's evidence of a new commitment on the part of our transnational institutions to communicate just what it is that makes them worth belonging to.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-16 16:23:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:59.394907", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 503, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 16.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26515, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4255, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Why two directors? </b>\n\nTo answer Katalin's question, there are two reasons why we have two non-executive directors instead of, say, 18.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>We are adamant in paying (a trip and a nice meal)\u00a0for non-execs to participate in at least one board meeting/retreat a year.

When things got quiet back, I asked to one why the fight ? \"I just said \"hello\" to his girlfriend on facebook...\"\n\nYou can't get the whole story behind something like that, but it reminded me a story about a guy kiling his ex-wife be cause she changed her profile to \"in a relationship\".\n\nSome young people especially don't seem to realise how their virtual acts can have consequences.\n\nI could share more about this, but I wanted to react on your conclusion :\u00a0\n\n<blockquote>The dangers of centralised social networks is that it gives too much power to only a handful people who have access to several of your personal details, pereferences, making you again only a number in a statistic, just a consumer profile, \u00a0as it always happens when the interests of the few lead the interests of the many.\n\n</blockquote>\u00a0\n\nThat's something we really need to think about. The technologies are improving and emerging at a pace that goes far beyond our possible understandings, especially with internet, because it touches to social, psychological and many other aspects. There will be consequences at every level.\n\nCentralised social networks like google or facebook have access to enormous quantities of social and psychological data material. At the moment, it's obvious they use it to get money thanks to advertisments, they are also trying to centralise a lot of services to make it easier for the user. I use google apps daily, mainly because I'm lazy and I like to work fast.\n\nBut I'm quite scared about what they can do with all the data they collect. They are gaining a power that we can't yet imagine. No one knows what powers these few people can already hold in their hands but I'd prefer to see these powers in the hands of scientists from all horizons, common people. Not in the hand of a few. I would for sure feel a lot safer about it.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-10 18:49:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:51.059913", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 530, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23757, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 5901, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Interview with Antonella next Tuesday 11am</b>\n\nThanks franca for posting the info,\n\nas some of you may have guessed I am drwning here with loads of things that keep me away from properly interacting ...

[\u2026] it became clear to me that I needed a big change. I could not see myself working as an economist outside of the university. [\u2026] I decided to start studying again, and I went for the most risky of all options: art academy. The first obstacle was to get in. I wasn't sure at all that I had sufficient talent and skills to be accepted, and got the help of a friend to practice drawing. It turned out I was not that bad so I decided to face the challenge. <strong>I had to pass a selection to be accepted and that went well</strong>. I was in. The journey started. At the same time I kept working on my PhD dissertation and then you can immagine what the next obstacle on my way was: managing to divide my time between two impossible tasks at once, and still not forgetting to eat, drink, sleep and of course see some friends every now and then. The challenge was too big for me. I did managed to finish my dissertation and to defend it with succes, but immediately after I got sick. Kidney stones. Terrible pain. Even though not a dangerous disease, it did put me out of running for a while. And even when I got better, I still could not work at full power as I used to do before. [\u2026] It took one year and some more months before I was back to my full capabilities. My new life had started for real. I needed to earn some money in order to pay my studies and the rent of my flat. <strong>So I took a job at an international call center</strong>, helping customers maintain and use their GPS systems. The salary was low, and the customers where often angry and unrespectful on the phone.\n\n<strong>I managed to find a better job after one year thanks to a friend of a friend</strong> who worked in a factory where they needed someone to model 3D drawings of chocolate bonbons. This was a nice opportunity. I could use my technical skills and creativeness together. I learned to use the software very quickly and was able to keep the job for three years. After that came the financial crisis. <strong>My job went lost, so I got fired even though I was a very good employee</strong>. In the meanwhile I finished the studies at the art academy, but I did not have any working experience in the field of my choice: graphic design. Every single job offer in this area required at least three years of experience, in that period (in the middle of the crisis).\n\nThis gave me no choice in fact. <strong>I had to start on my own and give myself a chance.</strong> I got some financial support from the government to get started, but it was clear that it would be tough. And it still is. <strong>After almost two years I still do not manage to make a living out of my work as a designer, even though I do have some assignments and I really love my work.</strong> Part of the problem is that I do not like to sell my work, [\u2026] I am a creative person and my creativity is bound to authenticity. I do not fit the majority of the market, that is looking for commercial, cheap, standard kind of design. I always look for content and I prefer to work for ideals than for the money. That's why <strong>I am very happy I have found a nice side job at the local theater</strong>. I sell tickets for a couple of days in the week and this way I am able to pay the rent. In my atelier I make design and free works of art. I also sometimes give lessons to art academy students of graphic design. I teach semiotics. I live month by month, always wondering whether I will be able to keep \"surviving\" as an independent graphic designer and visual artist. Somehow, after the first really terrifying weeks I got used to this situation. Until now I managed to keep going on and the feeling is that <strong>I am learning and that I do get a lot of satisfaction from my work</strong>. So I hope that I will be able to do it for much longer.\n\n<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/tudor-maft-small.jpg\"><img align=\"left\" alt=\"Tudor\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1046\" height=\"52\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/tudor-maft-small.jpg\" title=\"tudor maft small\" width=\"52\"></a> <em>In reply to Ale\u2019s story, Tudor sends a thoughtful comment that same evening</em>: \"Hello Ale! Congratulations for doing what you felt to do. Really, there are people out there that consider the 3-4-5 years investment in something a reason to continue all their life on the wrong path. Now I think you have a few simple options. Graphic designers are working: For big companies (like specialists, on the graphic departement usually with well trained individuals), for studios ( which are doing their work focused on the creative part and not on the business part) , or as a freelancer so working project based for different companies/projects. I really think that working in a Graphic Studio will suit you. Someone told me once that when you think or feel or something at some moment there are at least another 10 people that ar thinking/feeling the same things at the specific moment. So don`t lose your sight. Try to find that people, they`re out there. \"\n\n<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ale.png\"><img align=\"left\" alt=\"Ale\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1088\" height=\"52\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ale.png\" title=\"Ale\" width=\"52\"></a>\n\n<em>She replies by slightly picking up on Tudor\u2019s sheer optimism:</em>Thank you Tudor.

You made a choice, paid for it in blood, and you carry it on. You do many things in your life, but you are a graphic designer, full stop. My question to you would be: do you feel anybody or anything provided you with useful resources to make the leap from academic to designer? By \"resources\" I mean opportunities, or assets (like a place to stay near the Art Academy), or even just recognition, encouragement, respect? (I have many more questions, actually...)\"\n\n<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ale.png\"><img align=\"left\" alt=\"Ale\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1088\" height=\"52\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ale.png\" title=\"Ale\" width=\"52\"></a><em>Ale:</em> Dear Alberto, thanks for your feedback and encouragement. About your question, I actually do not feel I was much supported in my choice. I had to bear the costs all on my own, and not only the financial costs (college fees) but also the \"management\" costs if I may call them so. For instance, when in my third year at the art academy I was expected to do an internship in a graphic design studio, nobody in school helped me find one. I think there is much to win there, by creating more connections between the school and some studios. And not just that, the school also did not provide me with time to actually spend in an internship: they expected me to keep working on my school assignements as usual (the hardest in fact, in your third year) while doing an internship and at the smae time paying college money (and supporting myself, which is impossible with just an internship of course, so I had to keep my side job as well). I think there is a lot to win there, for instance by providing good information and advice on how to finance and time manage such a situation, and by giving students actual time to do an internship. ...\n\n<em>Obviously, this conversation will continue, and we are curious to see whether people in graphic design have advice for Ale, maybe direct her to an employer; or maybe people who need to buy design will convince Ale to accept payment for her work. Why expect this? Because Edgeryders relate to your story on some level, they are facing their own transition\u00a0don't they? Finally, they are interested and pay attention.\u00a0</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2011-10-31 10:23:08", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 13:57:46.236973", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1873, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20737, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2707, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>We missed you at the workshop!</b>\n\n<span>Hi Mariam, I was looking forward to meet you in person, hopefully next time?\n\nI'm sure Inge is probably in touch with you, but wanted to invite you to stick around anyway and join the local action group that came out of the workshop - with meetups scheduled every other week in Tbilisi.

This is the case of Lee-Sean's community which consists of around a decade of emails.\n\n- The numbers on the right side (no of edges/modularity...etc) is calculated on the whole network, it is something to be aware of when hiding sub-communities because the numbers are not recalculated according to what's shown.\n\n- For the 1<sup>st</sup> use of Edgesense by those with no background knowledge on network science and analysis, the tutorial helps to have a basic understanding of the structure underlying a network of interactions.\n\n- Moderators are always the black colored nodes (this wasn't mentioned anywhere)\n\n- The general network is useful in explaining the community to people (\u201coutsiders\u201d) or for fund-raising purposes. It gives an idea on how big/complex/alive is the community, even without trying to deeply interpret the network. (Noemi)\n\n- The network could look very complex so trying to reduce the visual complexity is an issue. Although Noemi and Hazem said that once you know the network it's not that complex any more, because they know it so well, first hand.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">On sub-communities</h3>\n\nThe algorithm is neutral in identifying the sub-communities, most algorithms do something similar to the Louvain, which is basically clustering people based on the links connecting them, this gives a better vision on who is actually talking to whom, rather than clustering them according to the groups on the platform.\u00a0Alberto explained that the modularity value adds more info to the picture as the algorithm will always find some kind of sub-communities. In the case of Edgeryders network which is relatively modular (0.35) the number of sub-communities makes sense visually but in the case of a network with low modularity (0.1 for example) a lot of sub-communities will be there with a lot of different colours which could be confusing.\n\nLee-Sean mentioned that colours are sometimes confusing because it is similar in all the interface (same colours in the network and in the boxes around it).\u00a0There is <span>no clear cut number of sub-communities</span> so there is no specific number of colours but\u00a0it is possible to use a colour palette for the network which is not used in the boxes in the interface.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">On zooming</h3>\n\nIn order to zoom, you need to press the unlock button on the top right of the screen.( this wasn't mentioned anywhere) Also zooming works better with a mouse.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">On search feature</h3>\n\nWhen searching for someone, the node itself isn't highlighted differently inside its network which make it hard to identify, you must figure out which one it is manually.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">On time slider</h3>\n\n<span>It would be useful to have an analysis and visualization for the last period of time (year / six months),</span> in addition to the all time network. It gives an idea on the status quo and who is active now. Also it is useful for older communities as Sabrina explained in InnovatoriPA there were a lot of old nodes from the beginning which are not active any more and the shape of the network could be somehow different now with the only active ones. Also it is needed for activity management and in showing how each activity changed by time.\n\nOne of the missing info that could be helpful from a community management perspective is the <span>time of changing the user to a node, or the little active node into an active one</span>. Specifically, this is about finding a way to distinguish visually between more active users and less active ones, for a benchmark no. of edges, say 1, and for a given time since registration, say first month. Having this info in real time would be helpful in on boarding people and saving this info to check if there is a pattern in between signing up and contributing which could be helpful to know when to intervene as a community manager. The challenge would be the representation of this data in Edgesense. <span>The live ones could be a separate floating box but what about the old data?</span>\n\nHaving 2 time sliders technically is a computational problem but there are some alternatives that could work keeping the requirements on the server as low as possible.\n\nOne is to have an option to <span>ghost out the nodes the nodes that are not active for a year for example.</span>\n\nAnother one is using tabs for different representations of the network. One of them could <span>use colours to show the freshness of the node/edge</span>. Using green colour for the new ones and fading to grey when they are dead/inactive.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-10 19:46:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:24.348903", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1004, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6326, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 6293, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<i>Coming to EdgeRyders to work on social media I have taken a look at what kind of insights our analytics data from the past year can provide us with -\u00a0in terms of where our audience is coming from and how effective our social media strategy has been in reaching new users. With this blog post we will start by establishing a general overview of our social media presence and the contribution it plays towards the development of the platform.</i>\n\n<i><strong>Measuring social engagement</strong></i>\n\nA simple place to start is to compare the number of visitors coming to <a href=\"Edgeryders.eu\"><em>edgeryders.eu</em></a> via social referral to the total number of sessions on the site. Using <em>Google Analytics</em> we can gain a better understanding of how these metrics correspond to one another.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d569b34ca9683eb8b8e1ec8012b57a43cc831151.png\" width=\"673\" height=\"378\">\n\nIf we look at the past month (in this case, from March to April 2017) we can see that the two are working closely in tandem, with a spike in traffic from April 30th to May 6th driven by a greater number of social media referrals (2276 visitors, or 61% of total traffic) than usual.\u00a0\n\n<em>Buffer</em>, our main social sharing service, offers further insight into how the frequency of our posts contributes to overall engagement with the site.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bc954a3742f7d2ba7ecec3d0e0b7871fe07b4a6a.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"312\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a598ec37181fd92a10831641b42b301d91c6e8c0.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"311\">\n\nLooking at a 90 day period this time, there is a direct correlation between sharing frequency and links clicked. This may seem obvious at first,\u00a0but we do not want to run the risk of oversharing content to an absent audience -\u00a0the frequency of posts plays an important role in controlling this\u00a0signal to noise ratio. Twitter for example is a high frequency medium, with a near constant flow of information and discussion, so posting once a week will not draw much, if any attention. Conversely, publishing a blog post or sending out a newsletter on a weekly basis alone can provide\u00a0a strong signal boost. The key is to find\u00a0the optimal frequency range for each service, which I will write about in\u00a0my next post.\n\n<i><strong>What platforms are being used most effectively?</strong></i>\n\nThe Social Overview report (found under the \u2018Acquisition\u2019 tab in the sidebar) in <em>Google Analytics</em> provides us with information on which social networks are sending traffic to the site, and more importantly to us, what <i>kind</i> of traffic.\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e91e3ef8541b33b5c3e1684de6785fc2da730d0b.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"227\">\n\nLooking at the top 5 traffic providers, Facebook leads the field and is responsible for 3067 visits in the month of April, or 80% of social referrals. While this tells us that Facebook is sending a large number of users to the site, it is just as important to understand what these users are doing once they get here. Twitter contributed far less traffic, with about 14% of all referrals, but we also see that the average time spent on the site is longer (by <em>3 minutes and 9 seconds</em>) and the average number of pages visited on the site higher (<em>3.12 to 1.6</em>) than the average Facebook user.\n\nWhile the difference may seem small, these statistics reflect the central tendency of a group of users - with half of Twitter users spending\u00a0longer than <em>4 min 34s</em> on the site, this is a very decent average. The reality is that visitors from Twitter will spend more time engaging with the site than those from Facebook. While a smaller audience, it is also a more targeted group of users that we should continue to invest in.\u00a0\n\n<strong><i>What data matters?</i></strong>\n\nWe\u2019ve had a brief and very general overview of how much weight social media carries in bringing users to the\u00a0<em>Edgeryders</em>\u00a0community and a general breakdown of the services providing the most amount of traffic.\u00a0\n\nIn the search for meaningful metrics we can easily lose ourselves\u00a0in a statistical stew of data such as reach, conversions, leads, impressions, engagement, amplification percentiles and so forth. In my next post, we will be looking at the data that matters for <em>Edgeryders</em> and what this should tell us about our long term objectives for the community.\n\nFor now though,<em> what are your thoughts on these metrics and how do they fit within our social media strategy?</em> <em>What audiences should we be targeting that we are not already, and how can we improve engagement with our existing users?</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-15 16:29:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:36.702099", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 983, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 643, "user_id": 2938, "topic_id": 610, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Boundless Futures seeks to build an international network of writers, artists, journalists and editors who can collaborate, share ideas, and feature material in different media.

Available data tell us that welfare services are directed to a minority of citizens, creating a gap with all the others.\n\n<strong>But what are the main changes taking place?</strong>\n\n- The aging population;\n\n- The reduction in resources due to the economic and financial crisis;\n\n- The changing role of the family, its components and its characteristics;\n\n- The question of the role of youth in society;\n\n- The increasing multiculturalism.\n\nIn particular in Milan:\n\nSENIOR CITIZENS\n\nIn Milan, the ultra elderly residents aged over 60 are 394 673 (about 30%), mostly women (233,863). Of these 25% are people alone, who then often they face the last part of life in solitude.\n\nAmong these are the \"very elderly\" (over 80) are 94,330.\n\nThe elderly non self-sufficient are about 40,000 and they have a lot of care needs and the main caregivers are \u00a0familiars (usually sons) and health and social services.\n\nThese numbers also explain the growing significance of the phenomenon of the informal care market, the caregivers for elderly people.\n\nThe phenomenon is significant in Milan if you consider that in the city are estimated around 32,000 caregivers, both legal and illegal.\n\nIt 'also important to note that only 25% of the 39,000 non self sufficient elderly people living in Milan receive formal care provided by Municipality.\n\nWHERE ARE THE OTHERS?\n\nTHE ROLE OF WOMEN\n\nThe role of women/ mother in Milan \u00a0is increasingly complex. Just think that in Milan, in 2011, appear to be residents 383,221 women aged between 25 and 65 years and that the female employment rate in the city is 62.70%.\n\nThe above described demographic change also determines a situation where women who are 40 years old today can expect to share about 22 years of their lives with at least one elderly parent, 4 years longer than those born in 1960 and 10 years more than women born in 1940.\n\nThe Milanese women are, therefore, for most working women, whose problems of conciliation between family and work are even more marked than women of other cities of Italy.\n\nChildren in Milan between 0 and 6 years old are 83,605 of which only 6,902 are enrolled in pre-schools or nurseries and only 5,600 are enrolled in pre-school services and after-school primary school.\n\nWHERE ARE THE OTHERS?\n\nFRAGMENTATION OF RESOURCES\n\nWe also found a strong fragmentation between public funds used for care and a \u00a0lack of coordination. 43% of these resources comes from the State, Region, Municipality and Local Public Health Agency, \u00a0the other part are cash resources that come from INPS (National Insurance Contributions).\n\nThe project \u201cWelfare of all\u201d\n\nThe idea is to create the conditions to make sure that everyone has access to opportunities provided by the welfare, regardless of economic conditions, and that anyone can have an active role \u00a0in the welfare and thus responsible for the improvement of society. Therefore the name of the project: Welfare of all.\n\nThis approach seems to us really innovative. Adolfo Ceretti and Roberto Cornelli (partner of our project with the <a href=\"http://www.cnpds.it/eng/index.php?link=\">National Centre for Prevention and Social Defence</a>) told us: \"The claim of recognition of civil and social rights, after having supported the gradual expansion of the Western democracies, becomes more and more an individual claim that tends to exclude, in the name of \"my own right\", those of others. \"My\" right to public housing, the provision of \"my\" child daycare, and even the right to receive adequate medical care is seen in contrast with the rights of others. We prefer to support the removal from the list of those who \"are not as much citizen as I am \"- rather than to claim services that reach everyone.\n\nIn a context where human relationships are more rarefied, the solidaristic relations are weak, the gap between social segments is dangerously exploding. Insecurity and uncertainty have made the idea of \u200b\u200bcommunity something relative and fragile. \"\n\nWemi is developing an online platform that enables simple access to home care services of the City, making it possible for citizens to request new services, or in different ways, creating new solutions together, giving you the chance to find personalized answers.\n\n<a href=\"http://wemi.milano.it/\">http://wemi.milano.it/</a>\n\nWe realized also two territorial platforms, ie two listening spaces for citizens in the aim to promote the sharing of offers and needs among citizens. The territorial platforms perform the same function of the digital platform but in three different physical locations.\n\nIn these spaces people are helped to find the services they need, but also they are encouraged to share needs and services between groups of citizens, in the aim to aggregate the needs and provide shared answers . These services then work directly with families and traditional third sector associations.\n\nOnline and physical platforms are innovative tools because they force the entire system to rethink: the City of Milan has to change its vision of citizens and the world of the third sector needs to open up to new citizens and think again an adequate business model.\n\nFinally thanks to some ideas \u00a0received during some design sessions WEMI is implementing two pilot projects: \u201cApartment Block Welfare\u201d, with apartment block caregivers/home helps, and \u201cSchool Welfare\u201d, working with local schools, with a view to better integrating welfare provision.\n\nApartment Block Welfare\n\n<img alt=\"Screenshot_3.png\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Oi7QuWlB0Rb57UEkpqSyhhe0hVHz_gs3fBX655FVr6KwBBPiNX2Pg3YtjTu_IqcyMi2vBZUISgGAVka9L1AWyvTT2QqXSpL_Mpl7dDdfp5azYnPR3RDpOvSbZuXTUMMHI7K3WPFf\">\n\nFinancial education for social operators\n\n<img alt=\"Screenshot_4.png\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ie9ZQmuFJj9sOEnqh2cTIzv7YQHBXg5ZYjCGPymZVdcahqZIDDh58RjSVqYmRp1kfdJ0v0ZaLujlSw7RdcyRif1Z6h1roVbiiGhCTYkconDmTpC9m5cZrc_CLNuGKjg2UOm_Hgf4\">\n\nWhich are the main difficulties that we found?\n\nWe found different kind of difficulties.\n\nFrom the point of view of the City of Milan we\u2019re working with new tools that are very different from the typical ones. For example, we had to think about a new way to communicate services to citizens, trying to build a new visual identity system with the Department of Design at the Politecnico. Moreover we need to build a new language with the traditional actors (cooperatives, NGOs..) that can be understood by citizens \u00a0(not technical language).\n\nAnother difficulty has been to help no profit organizations to think new kind of products, beyond their traditional services in order to be able to answer to new and different needs. \u00a0\n\nSo the biggest challenge is to get out from traditional logic, in relation to how we think, how we communicate and we distribute services.\n\nWe believe that this new way of thinking services might lead to great opportunities, but we still need to prove that this idea is true. So we need to be brave and really believe and work on this idea.\n\nIn this sense the role of the Municipality is important because only Municipality can take the risk of innovation and make an investment that the private social agencies alone could not do, as they are forced to face objective difficulties also linked to a long economical crisis.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you know similar projects? Do you have suggestions for us?\n\nAll comments will be useful for building together this difficult road of Welfare innovation.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-16 14:49:51", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 06:24:43.287157", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1398, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 100.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3406, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 3373, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<style type=\"text/css\">.tftable {font-size:14px;color:#333333;width:1100px;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}\n\n.tftable th {font-size:12px;color:#FFFFFF;font-weight:800;background-color:#f1472b;padding: 8px;text-align:left;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse;}\n\n.tftable tr {background-color:#ffffff;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse;}\n\n.tftable td {font-size:14px;border-width: 1px;padding: 8px;text-align:left; vertical-align:top; }\n\n.tftable tr:hover {background-color:none;}\n\n.tftable img {}\n\n.tftable2 {font-size:14px;color:#333333;width:1100px;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}\n\n.tftable2 th {font-size:14px;font-weight:800;color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#f1472b;border-width: 1px;padding: 8px;border-style: solid;border-color: \\#729ea5;text-align:left;}\n\n.tftable2 tr {background-color:#ffffff;}\n\n.tftable2 td {font-size:14px;border-width: 1px;padding: 8px;border-style: solid;border-color: \\#729ea5;width:30%;vertical-align:top;}\n\n.tftable2 tr:hover {background-color:#ffff99;}\n\n.tftable2 img {width:100%; height:auto;}\n\n.tftable2 h3 {color:#f1472b; font-weight:800;}\n\n.tftable3 {font-size:24px;font-weight:800;color:#333333;width:100%;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}\n\n.tftable3 th {font-size:34px;color:#f1472b;font-weight:100;padding: 8px;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse;text-align:left;}\n\n.tftable3 tr {background-color:#ffffff;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse;}\n\n.tftable3 td {font-size:24px;font-weight:800;padding: 8px;border-style:border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse;text-align:left; vertical-align:middle; height:30%; }\n\n.tftable3 tr:hover {background-color:none;}\n\n.tftable h1 {color:#666666;}\n\n.tftable h2 {color:#f1472b;}\n\n.tftable h3 {color:#f1472b; font-weight:800;}\n\n.tftable3 h1 {color:#f1472b;font-weight:100; }\n\n.tftable3 h2 {color:#000000;font-weight:800;}\n\n.tftable3 h3 {color:#f1472b;font-weight:100;font-size:142px;}\n\n.tftable4 h1 {color:#666666;font-size:70px;}\n\n.tftable4 h2 {color:#f1472b;font-size: 45px;line-height: 15px;}\n\n.tftable4 h3 {color:#f1472b; font-weight:800;}\n\n.rtxt {color:#f1472b; font-weight:800;}\n\n.gtxt {color:#666666;}\n\n.gtxt2 {color:#666666; font-size: 16px;}\n\n.lg-txt {text-align:center;font-size:16px;font-weight: 800;}\n\n.brack {color:#f1472b;font-weight:100;font-size:142px;}\n\n.name {font-weight:800;}\n\n</style>\n\n<table border=\"0\" class=\"tftable\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td class=\"tftable4\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"350px\">\n\n<h1>#LOTE4</h1>\n\n<h2>The Stewardship</h2>\n\n<span>23-26 October, 2014 // Matera, Italy</span>\n\n</td>\n\n<td><span>We believe the ability to come together to take care of assets in an unstable context is a key skill for surviving and thriving in the future.\n\nThis event aims to set the foundations for a global Stewardship ecosystem encouraging free flow of information, knowledge and actors between different contexts, sectors and leadership roles.<em> Program is preliminary</em>.</span></td>\n\n<td style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\n\n<center>\n\n<img height=\"170px\" src=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/lote4/er-logo.png\" width=\"170px\">\n\n<center>\u00a0</center>\n\n</center>\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th width=\"350px\">\u00a0</th>\n\n<th width=\"350px\">\u00a0</th>\n\n<th>\u00a0</th>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><img src=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/lote4/fabrizio-s.jpg\"></td>\n\n<td><img src=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/lote4/benvickers-s.jpg\"></td>\n\n<td><img src=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/lote4/robin-s.jpg\"></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Fabrizio Barca</span> General Director at the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance.</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<strong>Ben Vickers</strong> Curator of Digital at Serpentine Gallery,unAbbot at the unMonastery.</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<strong>Robin Chase</strong> is the founder and CEO of Buzzcar, a peer-to-peer car sharing service, board member of World Resources Institute, World Economic Forum's Transportation Council, and US National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship.

The overarching logic behind this development and acquisition is generally to enable the provision of public services. In recent decades this model has become overstretched: states have found themselves struggling to find the resources to keep those assets manned so that provision of such services could continue, and had to retreat from many non-core services. Consequently, many such assets lie unused; some are beginning to deteriorate.\n\nIn an effort to correct this situation, some public assets have been turned over to the private sector. This move has had mixed results: while some financial advantages for states have indeed materialized, at least in the short term, many privatization programs suffer unintended consequences. The general consensus seems to be that it might be interesting to explore new avenues.\n\nCommunities have been singled out as candidates for taking care of some public assets, in particular those that can be used to provide services to the community itself.\n\nThere is now evidence available to indicate that communities can indeed provide stewardship. The EdgeRyders community has itself accumulated significant experience in this area. We believe the ability to come together to take care of assets in an unstable context is a key skill for surviving and thriving in the future.</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<center>\n\n<h1>#LOTE4</h1>\n\n<h2>Stewardship</h2>\n\n<span>23-26 October, 2014\n\nMatera, Italy</span>\n\n<center>\n\n<img height=\"auto\" src=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/lote4/unmonshot.jpg\" width=\"280px\">\n\n</center>\n\n</center>\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>Preliminary: Program is under construction <a href=\"/program\">here</a>.</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"tftable2\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th style=\"width:10%;\">\u00a0</th>\n\n<th>Day 1</th>\n\n<th>Day 2</th>\n\n<th>Day 3</th>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">08:00 - 09:30</td>\n\n<td>Welcome breakfast</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">09:30 - 10:00</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Fabrizio Barca</span>, General Director for Development at the Italian Treasury // <span>Ben Vickers</span>, unAbbot at the unMonastery</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Amelia Andersdotter</span>, Chair of the European Pirate Party// <span>Giulio Quaggiotto</span>, Pulse Lab Manager at UN Global Pulse</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>David De Ugarte</span>, Grupo Cooperativo de Las Indias // <span>Nadia El-Imam</span> Co-Founder and CEO, Edgeryders</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">10:00 - 10:30</td>\n\n<td>Coffee break</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"tftable2\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">10:40 - 11:05</td>\n\n<td style=\"background-color:#ffded8;width:90%;\">\n\n<span>Who are the key actors and trends in Stewardship?</span> Overview of the three parallel sessions</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"tftable2\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">11: 05 - 13:00</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Participants:</span> <span>Hazem Adel</span>, Edgeryders Egypt community manger// <span>Alessia Zabatino</span>, Project coordinator for Open Pompeii// <span>Dougald Hine</span>, Founder at Brixton Pound// <span>Ela Kagel</span>, Founder at Supermarkt// <span>Pier Francesco Maran</span>, Alderman, City of Milan//<span>J\u00f6rgen Hermansson</span>, Deputy Vice- Chancellor at Uppsala University // You.</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Participants:</span> <span>Annemarie Naylor</span>, Common Futures// <span>Simone Cortesi</span>, Founder of Open Street Map// <span>Matthias Ansorg</span>, Founder of Makerfox and Earth OS.// <span>David De Ugarte</span>, Socio de la Sociedad de las Indias Electr\u00f3nicas // You.</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Participants:</span> <span>Robin Chase</span>, Buzzcar// <span>Daniel Vaarik</span>, Memokraat// <span>Caroline Paulick-Thiel</span>, Founder of Prosumetime// <span>Petros</span>, Founder at Freedomlab // <span>Aidan Eyakuze</span>, Associate Regional Director at Society for international Development// <span>Vinay Gupta</span>, Associate at UCL Institute for Security &amp;

Many relevant themes. We've tried a bit of restorative circles too - though the people we work\u00a0with nicknamed it 'Conflict Kitchen' because of the way the guy who\u00a0introduced it to us described it - in that conflict is natural we just need somewhere to go with it - just as eating is natural and we go to the kitchen when we want to prepare food. We're still figuring out how to bed it in. I've also worked a bit with NVC and follow <a href=\"http://thefearlessheart.org/\">Miki Kashtan's</a> work most. I think the question you highlight in relation to Opencare is very pertinent - \"how we engage with our own and each other's well-being\". I'm also wondering if you're already tuned in to Laloux's <a href=\"http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/\">Reinventing Organisations</a> - the passages on wholeness practices seem particularly relevant to what you mention about growing a culture that supports collective &amp; mutual wellbeing. \u00a0\n\nThanks @Noemi for the link to the Enspiral Stewarding Circle - it looks like it'll shed light on something we've been wrestling in to reality for a while - we've been envisioning it as a 'network of fives' like a beehive. The question we've been aware of is how to create enough framework around peer-to-peer care without overformalising it and so it's interesting that others have been working with\u00a0this balance too.\n\nMental health is an ongoing focus within our working community too. @Woodbinehealth - I'm guessing you've come across the\u00a0<a href=\"http://theicarusproject.net/\">Icarus Project</a> - I love their work and came across it when issues around how we define mental health became overwhelmingly\u00a0real for my family. I love the way they frame their work as \"by and for people who experience the world in ways that are often diagnosed as mental illness\". I feel that this way of describing what we all experience at times when our mental health is stretched creates enough space so that people are not defined by their diagnosis.\u00a0\n\nIts contributed to my ongoing reflections on an organisation's mental health. I wonder if this is what you refer to when you say \"collective mental health\"? I've noticed that the organisation's mental health seems unwell when there is too great a distance between various peoples perceptions of the organisations reality and its relationship to the world. It feels too big a gap and too likely to contribute to mutliple organisational personalities that can often be at odds with each other. We've recently concluded a year long collaborative process that has generated really embedded alignment in core things like values, the assumptions and context we're responding to. The mental health of the organisation is noticeably improved.\n\nI hope that these conversations will continue up to and during the event in October. Much to glean...\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-28 13:44:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:33.498987", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 527, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24106, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2943, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Interesting idea</b>\n\nBut I still don't understand.

I'm a bit unsure what you mean, following our debrief of LOTE3 with the ER board, we discussed in brief [Alberto]'s role going forward - he said he'd continue to carry the project, and assist with any interfacing needed with the city, presumably wearing both an EdgeRyders and MT2019 hat. What that means in relation to ground rules, the shaping of unMonastery etc isn't much, the running of the space, the social configuration and the development of some long lasting model is our responsiblity as unMonasterians.\u00a0\n\nAs for the daily schedule, being the Master of the social kitchen [Bembo] I expected you'd post it online soon for collective review and then through some discussion we'd set it in (sand) stone for alteration following the first week of the unMonasteries opening in Matera. This could be aided by the post I'm about to write, summarising next steps.\u00a0\n\nIn response to thoughts on the unselection process. yes this has been causing much friction but I thought we'd established why we need to pass this first hurdle, the way I see it is this: we select the initial 10 unMonasterians, then everything else comes on top - starting the process of everything else on top now would be a good way of meeting the restrictions of such requirements. This might take the form of fleshing out what a residency program looks like for individuals to come for shorter time periods during the time of the unMonastery, to share skills and input, or [David B.] idea for unMonasterians living in the community or specific week long events that could take place in the four month period.\u00a0\n\nAs for your application [Bembo] it was never submitted officially through the online form here:\u00a0<a href=\"http://unmonastery.eu/index.php/join-us/unmonastery-application-form/\">http://unmonastery.eu/index.php/join-us/unmonastery-application-form/</a>\u00a0which lays everything out. That aside it feels more to me that it's a box to tick, and a better way to affirm your place at unMonastery is through alternative routes since you're part of the core build and are unequivocally essential to the success of the project - so [Alberto] how do we do this? Can we split my role in half with [Bembo] or can we confirm a place if a form is filled out?

Pre-welfare states (19th century), welfare was basically invented by European mutual assistance societies, in turn part of the workers' movement. I imagine that, in the early days, these societies were small enough that the choice of treating someone would visibily drain the common pool of resources. So, in those days, maybe European factory workers thought a bit more like the Amish. A modern-day version of that, though I only know anecdotes about it, is implemented by @lasindias .\u00a0\n\nI think autonomy\u00a0is also an interesting scenario in terms of policy, and fits well into @Lakomaa 's and @Tino_Sanandaji 's institutional economics framework.\u00a0\n\nMy summary from the article:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The Amish refuse to have insurance. \"When someone gets sick, the church collects alms to help the patient cover expenses.\"</li>\n\n<li>This might happen at a time when the community has other objectives as well (\"setting up a farm for a young couple\"). You can ask of the community to support your treatment, but its\u00a0costs are not simply discharged into an anonymous \"system\": they are borne by your own brothers and sisters. As a result, everyone focuses on not spending more money than is necessary, and\u00a0\"[Amish] communities are highly interested in health education and disease prevention\".</li>\n\n<li>For this reason, the Amish use genetic screening of children. Prevention is so important that its benefits trump the disadvantages of dealing with the world at large.</li>\n\n<li>They develop their own treatments (one for burns is described in the article). They navigate, with some difficulties, the interface with the mainstream medical world: clinical testing etc. These treatments tend to be very cheap.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Communities negotiate discounts, which hospitals are willing to offer in exchange for payment in full at the time of service. In one example (a child treated with surgery for colon cancer) price was negotiated down to 19,000 USD from 172,000, a 90% discount. \"For Americans with health insurance, it may come as a surprise that hospital costs are negotiable\".\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>The Amish don't sue. \"When the Amish told [a doctor]\u00a0they understand doctors are human and make mistakes, he had to pause to let that sink in. To them, he was not simply a member of the medical establishment, but an autonomous individual doing his best, given the choices and information before him.\"\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2016-08-06 08:24:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:19.580229", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 460, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13987, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 660, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Labels and grids, again (and Darwin)</b>\n\nIt looks like Raul is\u00a0advocating the removal of special categories (\"labels\") tagging underprivileged people. This means giving up our standard way of seeing the world by categories \u00a0that have administrative and\u00a0legal relevance\u00a0(\"grids\" in the language of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State\">James Scott</a>). \u00a0It seems to be a letimotiv in OpenCare.\u00a0\n\nI do see the potential for lock-in when administrative grids become involved. You get organisations that \"own a problem\": my\u00a0organisation deals\u00a0with blind people, yours\u00a0with teenage pregnancies etc. As long as these categories have currency in the policy document and in the strategies of donors, the organisations serving them will prosper. \u00a0\n\nWhat I don't see is why label removal should be so hard intellectually. We have something we can replace categories with: frequency distributions. Instead of saying \"we need to accommodate the disabled\" we can say \"3% of humans cannot go up more than one step, and the step needs to be lower than 200 millimeters\". They can be disabled, but also simply old, or exhausted, or drunk. This is irrelevant. What's relevant is that it's just plain stupid to design a building that will not work every time!\u00a0\n\nThis is the classic Darwinian move.\u00a0Linnean biology tried to characterize a species by characterics: birds have beaks, pelicans have very large beaks, humans walk on two legs... wait, that would mean Raul is not human, since he does not walk. But neither is he a fish, though he presumably can swim. So what do we do? Do we make him his own species?\n\n\u00a0Darwin said \"look, a species is simply a frequency distribution across certain characteristics. For example, most ants do not have wings, but some (males) do. About 98% (I'm making the number up here) of humans walk on two legs, but a 2% does not.\" The frequency distribution captures all the information a designer needs. What's so hard about using it?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-16 10:15:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:19.058498", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 360, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15085, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 5385, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>I edited the post</b>\n\nnow with the link ;)\u00a0\n\nsorry\u00a0;)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-08 17:31:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:25.007121", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 744, "user_id": 3410, "topic_id": 711, "post_number": 1, "raw": "In the 1980s, my mother has been working as an educator in the prison of my hometown, Trikala. As a result, I have been countless times inside the prison premises, and I am accustomed to this environment since the age of 10. Coming from this background, with my family aware of the power of education and creative action for those who are serving in a prison, I always knew I would end up doing something within this field.\n\nOur societies usually perceive inmates as people that deserve a second chance. Instead, I believe that inmates need to be convinced to give to society a second chance, and trust it again. Having a clear understanding of the challenges, and having a background in visual arts, I wanted to make museums understand that they have a social role, complementary to the preservation of cultural heritage. They ought to get out of their box and get in closer contact with the society. The National Museum of Contemporary Art already has already been working with communities inside the prison system. In April 2015, as part of my thesis on designing a museum outreach program that is open to vulnerable social groups, I started the project in the prison of Trikala.\u00a0\n\nSince inmates were not allowed to visit museums, we started designing our own, inside the prison. We\u00a0collected all art pieces from the last 8 years -ranging from photography, sculpting, pottering and audio to texts and design. And we did standard museum work, such as documentation or writing captions for each piece.\n\nThe name \u201cMESA\u201d (= \u201cinside\u201d in Greek) came through elections, which involved campaign speeches and polls. It was a very empowering process, because, for most of the people, this was the first time they voted. Once the name was decided, we offered information and guidance about things like logo design. But the logo was designed one night by the inmates themselves inside the prison wing. As a second step, we thought it would be nice to open the museum to other structures, acting as curators. We approached other prisons and some of the artwork was sent to the National Museum of Modern Arts in Athens, the whole process designed and executed by the team.\u00a0\n\nThis was the first opening of the National Museum of Modern Arts in Athens, and I was very proud that this large museum was open to the work of a young curator and that of a very stigmatized social group. The project team comprised of 12 artists and architects, but there were about 40 contributors in total (visual artists, volunteers, museum staff, etc). Including the inmates at the Centre of Therapy for Addicts, this number was raised to 100. In the prison school, we realize aspects like the notion of collaboration and democracy, through art. In total, we work with four prison structures and a Centre of Therapy for Addicts (KETHEA), which receives addict inmates, with the prospect of detoxification. Eighty percent of our community is younger than 35 years old. Another fifteen percent is up to 50, and five percent up to 70 years of age. This has mainly to do with the fact that we work with prison schools. Ninety-five percent of the inmates we are working with are immigrants, but we are also working with the Centre of Therapy for Addicts (KETHEA) which hosts mainly Greeks.\n\nWe collaborate with the Ministries of Justice and Education, the Centre of Therapy for Addicts (KETHEA), the National Museum of Modern Arts and the Municipality of Korydallos, the city hosting Greece\u2019s largest prison. The schools are operating under the auspices of the prison system of Greece, and there are always certain procedures to be followed. The Ministry of Justice needs to offer permission to enter the prison premises.\n\nWe didn\u2019t face many institutional problems, because as the project gets established, the resistance drops. There are, of course, problems. For example, most times I find myself at the center of everything, having to manage from finances to human resources. However, such operations involve activities that cannot be handled by one person. This is why we are now talking about creating an operational team, that will be able to take decisions and execute the project. The members are already identified and we are now meeting to discuss future plans. \u00a0\n\nMESA is currently an informal team, but we are now in talks about the creation of a legal entity, so we can manage funds and scale our projects. Meanwhile, Greek authorities have declared that they would give priority to education over security - something that is a very strong commitment. We are waiting for replies from the Ministries, in order to see whether we can be part of any public programs.\n\nWe don\u2019t consider MESA as a lesson, but as a collaborative creative office. Everything is decided in the circle - my opinion doesn\u2019t count more than theirs. We always try to have our own rules, but we also know how we have to behave according to the rules of a confined prison environment. If some of them look dumb, then we know we need to try change them slowly. This doesn\u2019t mean that we compromise our action in order to avoid conflict with the authorities, but it is a relationship of trust that has to be built very carefully. For this reason, we are also offering meticulous training to our team.\u00a0\n\nThe authorities are very open, but there is still lots to be done. I would like, for example, to be able to get the team out of the prison, in order to join in the exhibition. It was very difficult for me at the opening of the exhibition at the National Museum of Contemporary Art, since the team was not allowed to participate. My team was inside the prison, and I was there, in a different environment, and had to talk on their behalf.\n\nThrough the project, the team is able to build several life skills. Maybe the most important one is leadership since everybody is responsible for something and the team is co-managed collectively. For inmates, the project cultivates the sense of collaboration and taking up responsibility. These might not be skills per se, but are important for those who are inside the prison. Another important aspect of working together is the ability to exercise crisis management, something that is important to them, but also to me. It is important that everyone understands how to bring the result to the team. And then, there is a set of skills related to the arts and other social issues.\n\nWorking inside the prison is not an easy task. You need to always maintain a distance. Not between humans, but you need to understand your limits and protect yourself emotionally. One way of achieving this is not to talk about or listen to personal issues. Surely, this becomes increasingly difficult over time. You need to have respect and trust, and everything needs to be clear to everyone from the very beginning. To be able to set the goals transparently, and not function, nor to be considered as a \u201cteacher\u201d but as a collaborator. As a principle, we never ask, and never want to know, about what type of crimes have resulted in somebody ending up in prison.\n\nThe biggest challenge is, maybe, how to mobilize the society. The best way is to do this slowly and gradually, with actions like this at the National Museum of Contemporary Arts, that attract publicity. We have tried to come out with quality art, backed up by solid artistic work and curation, so the initiative doesn\u2019t receive a \u201cthumbs up\u201d just out of compassion, but because of the integrity of the results. Our aim was to communicate with the society equally and to be proud of it.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-15 16:16:44", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 14:52:59.973766", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1334, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32128, "user_id": 84, "topic_id": 1782, "post_number": 32, "raw": "Wow, this is a really interesting thread. I agree very much that the space should facilitate a structure of spiritual progression, as well as work and living. I am glad you have included a meditation space. I don\u2019t feel meditation should necessarily be limited to one-two people as group meditation can be a great way to introduce people to the practise and can really create a good atmosphere. In this light perhaps every unmonk plus guests, should have a sitting pillow.\n\nA couple of practical points; it would be good to combine washing area (eg sink) with hanging racks above as cleaning up will be a daily thing that will not want to be a distraction. Having hanging space for cooking equipment will help insure that it is not left out dirty or damp or put the wrong way up, and there will be no need for drying, or many cupboards to keep things in (which will also require cleaning).\n\nAlso I think the rooms should be divided by gender. Perhaps people who will struggle sharing sleeping space should have there own if possible.\n\nI have many examples of re-purposed materials in my computer as it is a big interest of mine. But like the true design of how a work space works I doubt the helpfulness of sending these ideas in, because the use of waste materials should be dictated by those materials. So if there are pallets, oil drums, water barrels etc then it is obvious that is what you use, if there is old furniture from residents they would like taken away then that is what you use. If you have an email and are interested maybe I could send you a folder of small pictures to inspire.\n\nmy opinion is that unmonks will need very little in the way of furnishings. To take into account ergonomics, I took to using a board of wood on my lap as read or write as the semi reclining position is better for your spine that upright at a desk.

With you being in the US I'd recommend having a look at <a href=\"http://www.tencate.com/amer/geosynthetics/products/geotextiles/default.aspx\">this</a> for a few minutes and then just ring up <a href=\"http://www.tencate.com/amer/geosynthetics/contact-us/tencate-geosynthetics-americas/default.aspx\">Tencate</a>. They should have the necessary materials, and you won't induce disaster because you're skimping on quality.\n\nPersonally, I'd still be a little afraid of using this above the 1st floor but I'm no expert. The other thing is that it probably is a lot of work (food calories) to raise such a structure, and you'd maybe rather re-use the rubble in some situations - but that is something people on the ground can decide much better. Two more advantages would be that you can airlift A LOT of the stuff for a song all the way to Nepal.

As it is <em>very </em>general I've thrown in the quotation marks. It'll probably take me some time to come up with something useful and concrete.\n\nFor now I'll try this:\n\n1. Evolution is not concerned with the well-being, or avoidance of suffering of \"subsystems\" such as humanity in a wide sense, or individuals. We generally are adapted to a relatively specific set of circumstances and rate of change. Too much or too little openness to openness and our coping mechanisms are more likely to fail I'd expect. Here I am more concerned with rate of global change not so much with local extent of diversity.\n\n2. Does 01 (openness to openness) imply reversibility? I think it does not. I wonder if it would be a good idea to privilege reversible aspects.\n\n3. One of my standard questions: What precludes a rerun? Is this perhaps just how a later stage of this could/would probably look like?\n\nIn other words, if this turns into a (limited) success - how is it likely to develop?

Coupons are a generalized \"fully fluid\" type of network barter, and the performance simulations indicate this is the right way. The Makerfox algorithm always struggled to include fixed-price product even though we had included quite a bunch of tricks (automatic alternative orders, subjective pricing, automatic price flexibility etc.). Network barter is just not the right tool for buying a specific product spontaneously. For that, we now recommend money :D\n\nAbout scarcity, I had started to write this out in more detail in the post above, but then thought it's too much detail for an introduction. You are of course right, coupons are backed by your time (or whatever else you want to trade away), which makes them naturally scarce. Makes sense on a finite planet I guess :-) What I should have said more precisely is this: coupons are not artificially scarce the way money can be. With money, a group of people with mutually beneficial offers cannot trade if they lack liquidity (paradigmatic example: the jobless). With coupons, they can, since everyone creates their own value tokens (\"coupons\") that are just as scarce as the resources they want to trade. That does not hurt trading. Only if your liquidity is scarcer than what you want to trade, trading is gradually inhibited.\n\nNow coupons are not a new idea of course. The closest\u00a0 thing to using coupons as currency are probably trade exchange bills (German \"Handelswechsel\"), which circulated like cash currency until they matured and could then (hopefully) be exchanged for products of the issuing company. They were however cumbersome to handle, since every intermediary merchant accepting them needed to know which ones are trustable \u2013 even of those they wanted to just pass on. What network barter does is taking this system but letting the whole trade chains happen in one instant (from issueing coupons to them arriving at the consumer who wants to spend them for products or services). So, as everyone only ever holds coupons they intend to redeem, the whole trust issue is resolved: coupons are not used as a replacement for cash money any more, and trust in the issuer is implied for coupons the holder intends to redeem. So somehow we got the best of both worlds: the better liquidity of a mutual credit currency, without either the need to trust and handle hundreds of intermediate currencies, or the \"solution\" to socialize them into a single currency (and getting the collective trust issue that prevents mutual credit currencies to scale beyond ~150 people). (Hmm interesting, I have to expand this line of thought into another blog post \u2026)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-19 23:27:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:34.752528", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 450, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 8.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16711], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23237, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1236, "post_number": 16, "raw": "<b>if we have a space when you dcide to travel</b>\n\nYou're always welcome to hang out at our place...Just saying :)\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-08 19:24:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.079489", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27092, "user_id": 1423, "topic_id": 2313, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>RE: Deadlines coming soon!</b>\n\n[Alberto] and [Rita O] this morning we went to unMonastery and we talked with the construction company and the technician of the municipality of Matera and they said that they will end up 17 Friday.

I already pitched this to Matera (<a href=\"http://community.matera-basilicata2019.it/content/resilient-cities-un-progetto-matera2019-unmonastery\">my pos</a>t, in Italian).\n\nMatera makes sense, since it is the seat of the first unMonastery, and resilience is one of the themes of the city's application to European City of Culture 2019; also, I like it a lot. But we should not wait around. Edgeryders LBG is up for doing the heavy lifting of preparing the applications, making sure competent people in the resilience space are lined up behind the city's proposal and that, in general, the application is a strong one. We are easily among the most credible teams in Europe that can do that \u2013 because we can involve you, hiring the experts on resilience among you to deliver.\n\nSo, I encourage entrepreneurial edgeryders who care about resilience to get in touch with cities they have a good relationship with and pitch the idea to them. If you need a corporate shell, you are welcome to use ours. If you find a client, we'll back you up, on a first come-first served basis; we'll hire you as project manager and we can move forward.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-09 18:03:12", "updated_at": "2017-09-15 10:20:17.969267", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 507, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 45.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14907, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 676, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>So is it problem solved?</b>\n\n\"Within a matter of hours, the team can turn a dusty schoolhouse, or whatever building is available, into an equivalent medical ward where sight-restoring surgery is carried out to comparable standards found in the developed world.\" (<a href=\"http://www.cureblindness.org/work/what-we-do/direct-services\">source</a>)\n\nThis looks like a good fit for community-driven care.

It is, however, very legal in Europe. For those that don't know, equity crowdfunding attempts to solve one very specific problem: how to create\u00a0a vehicle for smaller investors to legally and safely receive equity compensation in return\u00a0for investing sorely needed funds. Equity crowdfunding is a more democratic, accessible and inclusive way of of investing and doing business. I don't think I am so much concerned about which project ends up benefiting from\u00a0this model, so much as I am interesting in seeing EdgeRyders take on the idea. 1,000 members strong, EdgeRyders is in a great position to infuse any project with all kinds of energy. The crowdfunding just accelerates everything and gives an immediate and tangible\u00a0proposition to prospective stakeholders. The truth is not everyone has the same style as elf, a guy who has chosen to liberate himself from financial restraints. For everyone else, working with equity provides a huge motivational boost. It certainly beats a .gif merit badge. My level of dedication for projects goes through the roof when I am a part \"owner\" -- be it profit-motivated or otherwise. Anything else is just asking for handouts and in my opinion, that may sometimes be a noble thing, but it's also\u00a0not very sustainable.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-02-23 08:59:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:15.055509", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 341, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24090, "user_id": 1658, "topic_id": 3298, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Propose a session Christine?</b>\n\nhi <a href=\"/u/christine_timebankat\">@christine-timebankathens</a>, good to see you on the platform :) I think you could provide the Lote4 with valuable energy and knowledge particularly informing us about the initiatives around the concept of stewardship that the Festival of Solidarity and Social Economy will be presenting and building in the future as well as feedback from the UBIE summit you organised last weekend in Athens.

In the positive case, we should find the theoretical background and use the corresponding language. From your (Alberto\u2019s) feedback I understand that your specific background cannot help for the hypotheses 1 and 2. But maybe you could give some ideas on the +1, that is a strong Edgeryders\u2019 point and the one that should make our proposal unique: would it possible?\n\nIn this framework, (for everybody) a very specific, but for me urgent question\n\nHaving a digital space of possibility, what could be the most general term to name <em>everything </em>happens in it?\n\nUntil now I referred to \u201cconversations\u201d (and I like this term), but I don\u2019t think that everything that happens there can be defined a conversation. In the OpenCare website, when somebody upload a case, this is called a \u201cstory\u201d: is this a term usable by us, with some theoretical background? Other times other terms are used, as texts, interactions, behaviours, \u2026 \u00a0\u2026 \u2026\n\nWaiting for your feedbacks, here a na\u00eff proposal <em>(it is na\u00eff because I have not seriously verified the terms I will use - I just invented them for the sake of going on in our conversation): </em>\n\nOpnCare is a care-oriented digital space where a constellation of care-oriented <em>events</em> happens. These events have different characteristics. In my understanding they could be roughly divided in this way:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><em>indirect on-line encounters </em>(up-loading a post or a story -\u00a0 reading a post or a story<em>)</em></li>\n\n<li><em>direct on-line encounters </em>(direct interaction between two people online)</li>\n\n<li><em>online conversations for knowledge</em> (sequence of interactions aiming at getting information online)</li>\n\n<li><em>online conversations for action</em> (sequence of interactions aiming at doing something together online)</li>\n\n<li><em>online/insite conversations for action</em> (sequence of interactions aiming at doing something together online and in the physical world)</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIt is important to observe that these categories are fluid: they can evolve, from one to the others. Therefore, if today we would observe them in the website and register them, this would only be a frame of a movie. It would give an idea of the state of things at this given moment, but we know that everything will change immediately after that.\n\nThis observation permits me also to give an answer to the@Noemi point on which kind of examples do we want to consider. In my view, beyond the fact the events 4 and 5, at the moment, are not so many and not so strong, I think that, in any case, it would be better to consider all the kinds of events to observe their evolutions (and what made this evolution possible). Therefore, what we should explore is:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>when and how events evolve from 1 to 2 and then to 3; when they become 4, and when and how some of them evolve in 5, moving from the digital space to the hybrid, digital/physical space. \u00a0</li>\n\n<li>What have been the explicit or implicit affordances that made the different events happen and, in case, evolve from 1 to 5.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nOn the other hand, we should better understand what the OpenCare space really is and how it works. Again, my na\u00eff interpretation is that it is <em>space of possibilities</em>, favorable for different oriented events to happen and \u2013 possibly \u2013 evolve towards \u201cdoing together\u201d. I.e. towards conversations for action in the hybrid digital-physical space.\n\nIf this proposed conceptualization makes sense, we should find criteria to analyze not only the examples of different kinds of events, but also our OpnCare space, considered as a space of possibilities\n\nDo we have the possibility to do it (if by chance you will not have already done it)?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-30 13:15:49", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:53.693069", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 705, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4798, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4765, "post_number": 1, "raw": "As our beautiful stunted mutant of a <a href=\"/company/home\">company</a> seems to be taking roots, I am looking around for possible incubators/acceleration programmes.

Especially in mental health - they managed to get a centre open besides the hospital (see <a href=\"/t/freeflow-creativity/779\">Cosain</a> for more info).\n\nThat\u2019s by getting into anything that is public participation, getting lots of groups together.\n\nGalway City Community Network (CCCN) - they tried to influence the council. Galway got a Greenleaf award - there were events promised, funding,... and nothing happened. Currently all the environmental groups are putting pressure for something to actually happen, by going international: \u201cBecause we\u2019re officially registered we wrote to the Council through Galway\u2019s CCCN. The next stage is to go directly to the Greenleaf in Europe\u201d.\n\nGehan: what is comes down to is dropping this idea that creating jobs is important, and explore\u00a0decoupling work from jobs.

Lancaster co-housing. Not working. But builds in lots of protection for you. Sliding scale - when you live with people, how much are you keeping for yourself. It really comes into play when you have kids. That\u2019s when it gets interesting. The parenting dynamic can become tense. It\u2019s always a conversation between the individual and the collective. It might be interesting to hear more about how they\u2019ve doing.\n\nCommunity in Milano - Bovisa Co-housing. Post on Edgeryders. Premise when we got there was not as anticipated. Lack of understanding at the beginning that this was a communal project. Spectrum between family and \u2018sociality\u2019. Moved over time to sociality but not deliberately. Self-selection. Very organic.\n\nConnected to sharing everything - vs - sharing common values. Design, expectation, governance.\n\nWHAT WOULD BE AN ASPECT OF COMMUNITY SPACES LIVING/WORKING/LEARNING THAT YOU WANT TO LEARN AT OPENVILLAGE?\n\nBernard: Water supply - testing water. Trying to live with off grid. Reed beds. There are people working on this that we can network with. Several proposals have touched on the importance of water, there is energy to work with. or is it also more practical - like plumbing - that you're after?

Collective policing versus authoritarian policing - still limited; how to go beyond the reach of policy - perhaps by creating working principles that guide day to day interactions and relations?\n\nJohn: underlying theme would be just asking them what are ways to form alliances without a pre-defined outcome.

I mostly remember him for knowing probably all brand new, absurd Twitter accounts, and being able to quote quite a lot of their content.\n\nThen I have learned a bit more - and the more unveiled, the more impressive it got. There is a great reason for us to team up and work on the challenge together: Hacking, internet security, and medical devices. He knows a lot about that stuff.\n\n\u00c9ireann with his friend, Dr. Marie Moe started investigating the security of pacemakers - as Marie's life actually depends on a little instrument that generates each of her heartbeats. And runs\u00a0on a proprietary code. This means she has to implicitly trust the programmers, and despite her and Eireann\u2019s years of assessing devices for security holes, they wouldn\u2019t normally be \u201callowed\u201d to investigate the security of such devices.\n\nThis implies how little a regular customer of similar devices is informed about the ways they work, what protocols and tools they use, where their data is stored, etc. It has everything to do with person's safety - and still, companies keep most of the key information secret from the users, making them more vulnerable.\n\nI suggest you watch this <a href=\"https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7273-unpatchable#video&amp;amp;t=68\">great video</a> from 32C3, where Marie and \u00c9ireann tell about their journey.\n\nObviously, the issue of safety transcends this case and applies to a whole range of tools that increasingly improve our quality of life and longevity. The security flaws are potentially causing exactly the opposite, making for a health/life hazard. There are concerns about privacy too, where your medical data flows around the world to companies that may or may not be taking measures to protect it.\n\nBut that's not all - \u00c9ireann works also as an advisor for European Network for Cyber Security (ENISA), has founded http://www.concinnity-risks.com/, and works as a Senior Risk Researcher at Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies. He is loosely affiliated with <a href=\"https://www.iamthecavalry.org\">I Am The Cavalry</a>, a cyber security movement, whose motto is \u201cSafer. Sooner. Together.\u201d\n\nHe contributes to our <a href=\"/en/openandchangecare\">OPENandChange</a> application vast expertise in the security of medical devices, and embedded devices. He will be helping DIY makers, programmers, and engineers with training on how to build safer code, and what standards they will want to comply with to produce products for different markets. He's also offering insight into vulnerability research and standards-based research, contributing safety and transparency knowledge to this huge, open swarm OPENandChange wants to become. Lastly, he loves the idea of preparing a consumer training and equipping people who rely on medical devices with knowledge and clear questions they can ask about their own devices.\n\nFinally, \u00c9ireann has just been announced an <a href=\"https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/open-web-fellows/fellows2016\">Open Web Fellow</a> for Privacy International and he will be taking the word out about our idea while advocating for open cyberspace.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-03 11:41:57", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 06:01:02.405404", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 549, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 91.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12635, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1371, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Clueless, but still...</b>\n\nInternational school?

And on the other there is a plethora of organisations, causes, initiatives, processes and projects that try to engage people in supporting them with time, knowledge and or skills.  Many if not most of these calls for participation will fail. I would argue that at the heart of the many reasons as to why is the lack of solid social contracts that both ensure that objectives and responsibilities are met and high quality results delivered AND make credible commitments that protect participants from exploitation as free labour. No matter how many times I come across it, it never ceases to amaze me how good intentions and normative thinking blinds people to investing serious thought and effort  into giving an attractive (as perceived by those whom you wish to engage) answer to the seemingly simple question: how can I justify spending time or other resources on this instead of the many different things pulling me in other directions- what are you offering that is of value to me that could not be gotten anywhere else? Why do I care about this?<strong> Spaces that bring people together to interact, learn from and support one another are valuable and much needed</strong>.  I think with Edgeryders 1.0 we did a reasonable job of a tentative first step and it's starting to show some signs of being sustainable given a little more time. That \\#lote2 is at all happening is one of the many signs that support that statement- a community organised event that happens because community members decide it is time to meet and just get on with making it happen. I  have been thinking long and hard and have come to the conclusion that the failure of so many initiatives to engage people to actively participate in them is intimately tied to three issues that have been raised time and time again in the discussions we had during the last year. They fall into two categories. The first has to do with the ways incentives are aligned and Im not going to get into this here because it is beyond my influence. The second category is one where I feel there more space for me to make a positive contribution addressing 1) differences in understanding of the value of work and what makes it meaningful 2) gaps b<a href=\"http://blay.se/edgeryders.html\" target=\"_blank\">etween how some understand and encourage participation and how those who they wish to involve in their efforts wish to go about doing so</a> as well as 3) building little awareness of how to build participatory online spaces so that they are not contributing towards what Clay Shirky refers to as digital sharecropping. More often than not it is not feasible to pay everyone to contributed (limited resources or other  external constraints on how resources can be allocated). We cannot claim to be making a contribution to improving the situation for ourselves and our communities on the one hand if we with the other unreflectingly contribute to a culture of exploitation which is exacerbated when times are hard (dead-end unpaid internships being exhibit A). I think we can and should do so much better.\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Number one in my rulebook (which is always evolving) is<strong> build for re-usability</strong>. And to build it in such a way as to at least not make it impossible for those who see a value in it to keep it going or building on it. Edgeryders Sweden is a membership based organisation not formally tied to the original Edgeryders project or platform but as you can see from their <a href=\"http://www.edgerydersweden.org/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> it's clear that they were inspired by it as they are remixing the graphics we produced for the platform. Not only does this make me personally very proud, it also means that the investment made into graphic design is a much better one because someone else is reusing it. Releasing all content including visual material under sharing friendly licences such as Creative Commons removes a large barrier from others adopting and building on the work you do. Using open source alternatives when you can and releasing the codebase (with good documentation please) on repositories like github and setting up sandboxes for people to use is another.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Try to give back to the people who contribute.</strong> Put some effort into making whatever you do beautiful, interesting and emotionally rewarding for those who are generous enough to give you the time of day. Especially if the people you are dealing with are having a hard time in life.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Don't put valuable resources into one-offs and \"pilot\" projects</strong>. If you have to at least make sure you don't spend it all up front but put aside a significant chunk away so that you can act on the feedback and or ideas that participants contribute. That way maybe you'll end up leaving behind you something that contributes in a direct way to solving a real issue or problem for the people. Lowering the costs of coordination is one such real problem.</li>\n\n<li>And finally <strong>put some (of your own) skin in it</strong>. Don't ask or expect people to go out on a limb, take risks and or be generous with their time, skills and other resources unless you yourself are willing to lead the way in doing so.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nGreat. Another list of generic how-tos that don't solve THE problem :) What does all of this really mean, how do we live up to this in deed as well as in intention? A good place to start is by collaboratively crafting a social contact that is credible because it is perceived as being fair, pragmatic and allows for flexibility. If we want to make any participatory, collaboration oriented online community space healthy and  sustainable we need to weigh all kinds of different factors in. Because the different stakeholders in this will have different objectives, priorities, working rhythms, access to resources, ways of recognising impact and results.. A lot of work and attention to detail went into designing the social contract for Edgeryders 1.0. And it went reasonably well. So I though I would take a crack at designing a new social contract for future iterations of Edgeryders and or other projects to use as a basis for constructive discussions at \\#lote2.

o della tutela - nel difficile contesto del vivere pienamente e realizzare compiutamente un progetto che vada oltre la \u201ccura\u201d da parte dei propri cari, oltre a quella delle istituzioni. Successi e difficolt\u00e0 che tuttavia solo in questi ultimi anni hanno visto agire nei processi decisionali con un riconosciuto ruolo di protagonisti le persone direttamente interessate. Un cammino spessissimo difficoltoso, che richiede abnegazione oltre che motivazioni solide ed acquisite competenze sul campo, attuato da pochi in favore di molti spesso non consapevoli, iterando almeno per i secondi una sorta di continua delega in bianco in merito al proprio futuro.\n\nUn colpevolmente atteggiamento passivo, che caratterizza tutt'ora l'esistenza di chi bisognoso di particolari attenzioni, che la forza \u201cdestabilizzante\u201d del Progetto pu\u00f2 mutare risvegliando le coscienze di quei molti che potrebbero e dovrebbero veramente mettersi in gioco.\n\nIl secondo elemento intimamente correlato al precedente riguarda il ruolo dell'associazionismo \u201cdi categoria\u201d, del terzo settore in generale, che in questi anni \u2013 ma anche oggi ed auspicabilmente domani \u2013 hanno garantito alle fasce deboli della popolazione una vita dignitosa e rispettosa attraverso la creazione, il consolidamento ed il faticoso mantenimento di soluzioni e processi sociali ed assistenziali in sostituzione di un apparato pubblico sempre pi\u00f9 in difficolt\u00e0 e molto spesso privo di sensibilit\u00e0 e visione rispettose dei bisogni individuali quanto povero di capacit\u00e0 strategiche in relazione ai profondi cambiamenti dei quali sono oggetto il sociale e l'amministrazione della cosa pubblica. Lo sforzo pluridecennale di queste realt\u00e0, che racchiude esperienze sia di gratuit\u00e0 che di iniziativa imprenditoriale e che attualmente \u00e8 interessato da una profonda riforma istituzionale e normativa, nel correre del tempo ha prodotto purtroppo anche alcune storture, \u201cdeviazioni\u201d, che se non in rarissime eccezioni contribuiscono nel complesso alla sopravvivenza di una cultura paternalista ed assistenzialista certamente responsabile del sensibile ritardo con il quale oggi affrontiamo le difficolt\u00e0 globali e nel contempo cerchiamo di cogliere le opportunit\u00e0 offerte dalle tecnologie e dalle metodologie ampiamente utilizzate in molti ambiti delle nostre complesse societ\u00e0.\n\nIl Progetto OpenCare scardina completamente questo \u201cvisione\u201d, ribaltandone completamente l'approccio, introducendo nei delicati ed un po' sclerotizzati meccanismi dell'assistenza e del supporto alla persona concetti e paradigmi mutuati dalla cultura generale delle risorse aperte e liberamente condivisibili da tutti, in una sorta di \u201cfai da te\u201d riveduto ed aggiornato attraverso la disponibilit\u00e0 di strumenti flessibili e potenti a costi estremamente contenuti, che in modo radicale consentono di riposizionare il singolo individuo nella centralit\u00e0 dell'azione trasformandolo da semplice oggetto fruitore di prodotti e servizi generalizzati e spersonalizzanti, oltre che poco economici nelle complesse implementazioni, a soggetto creatore di un sapere accessibile, condivisibile ed esportabile nella sua essenzialit\u00e0.\n\nUna via percorribile, questo \u00e8 il presupposto e nel contempo l'obiettivo del Progetto, che deve sicuramente sorprendere, sollecitare e coinvolgere soprattutto il \u201cmondo\u201d del bisogno, oltre a quello istituzionale ed economico sociale, per garantire un terreno \u201cdi coltura\u201d favorevole all'avvio di iniziative e progetti che naturalmente rispettino l'integrit\u00e0 delle persone e delle loro legittime aspettative, che debitamente tengano conto del supporto e dell'impegno della collettivit\u00e0 e che ne garantiscano l'azione solidale attraverso le buone pratiche di indirizzo e di governo locale, nazionale e transnazionale.\n\nLe pi\u00f9 che consolidate tecnologie della comunicazione ed il movimento che si alimenta e ne contribuisce la diffusione e la pervasivit\u00e0 consentono infatti oggi di realizzare una \u201cdemocrazia liquida\u201d, che sfugge completamente ai vecchi canoni conosciuti dalla storia, attuando con maggiore puntualit\u00e0 e concretezza possibili percorsi e processi virtuosi per la qualit\u00e0 globale della nostra vita.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIl terzo ed ultimo elemento riguarda la mia dimensione personale.\n\nDa alcuni anni, per via di una curiosit\u00e0 congenita e di una affinit\u00e0 professionale, osservo il mondo dei makers con crescente interesse alimentato costantemente dai \u201cprodigi\u201d dei prodotti complementari che consentono agli \u201cartigiani del xxi secolo\u201d di realizzare oggetti o soluzioni sorprendentemente efficaci quanto semplici. Arduino, orgoglio autentico del nostro \u201cfare\u201d italiano, insieme ad altri nomi e progetti di caratura internazionale letteralmente \u201crimorchiano\u201d quanti, come lo scrivente, ad un primo stupore e ad una prima titubanza dettata dalla presunta inadeguatezza reagiscono con un progressivo coinvolgimento in azioni ed in attivit\u00e0 che conducono ad una nuova percezione della realt\u00e0, via via pi\u00f9 plasmabile a misura dei \u201cbi-sogni\u201d.\n\nLa mia disabilit\u00e0 fisica motoria congenita non mi consente di fatto l'azione diretta tramite la manipolazione fisica degli oggetti precludendomi una ampia serie di sensazioni ed emozioni che percepisco vissute nelle persone intorno a me. Tuttavia la mia intelligenza, la mia sensibilit\u00e0 e la mia creativit\u00e0 sopperiscono in buona misura ai miei limiti dandomi comunque la possibilit\u00e0 di vivere compiutamente l'incontro con questi inaspettati compagni di viaggio, l'Associazione WeMake prima ed il Progetto OpenCare dopo, che potenzialmente potr\u00e0 tradursi anche nel compimento di un sogno coltivato sin dai tempi della prima giovinezza \u2013 divenire creatore di oggetti funzionali oltre che esteticamente validi \u2013 insieme a quanto desiderato oggi \u2013 realizzare prodotti e soluzioni di alta tecnologia nell'ambito della residenzialit\u00e0 autonoma per le persone con vari deficit fisico motori e cognitivi \u2013 nutrendo inoltre la segreta aspirazione di trovare finalmente una strada sulla quale realizzare questa mia importante dimensione esistenziale, a lungo in attesa di una autentica rivoluzione.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-03 21:39:36", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 16:13:23.497712", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1512, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 777, "user_id": 3448, "topic_id": 744, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\"><strong>Alzheimer\u2019s Wristband &lt;3</strong></h2>\n\nIdea is about helping the families of the patients who have alzheimer's at last stage.

After Nepal lost 60 % of its naturally built forest and faced several conscequenses, this lead to the mass plantation of easily and cheaply available pine forest with the help of govt backed funding.\n\nThese days we see pine forest almost every part of Nepal especially being owned by community. These kind of dense forest have been a trouble to many users because of its nature. \u00a0The green leaves are not being able to use for villagers cattle, the dry leaves are fallen down not allowing the pasters to grow, the forest also doesent allow other diverse plants to live around even not absorbing and protecting the waters for springs. The villagers are forced to do extra work cleaning the forest for good pasture.\n\nThe concept of community forest was developed to help make peoples life easy and people takes care of the forest by preserving, but this forest turn to be opposite\u2026that people took care of forest and had to work extra cleaning the dried pine leaves and loosing the spring water. I guess this problem is not only in Nepal so These days people have developed a ecological designing of the forest called permaculture, a designed forest creating \u00a0the eco- system.\n\n\"green forest nepals wealth\"famous saying in nepali\u00a0 a true idea on how important is forest in Nepal. A forest should be diverse itself in nature and allows diversity of use supporting many lives through and in it.

I have no experience in that except when I\u2019ve watched friends and family members who free themselves from smoking, start doing exercise, etc. It\u2019s hard but in many cases doable.

In this view, \u201cpatients\u201d are, as the name implies, the inert sand at the bottom of the pyramid. He favoured a completely different view, based on the history of diseases and people: at the very beginning, there was this child who fell off a tree, and his mum came to take care of him.

Sorry I've been gone for a while.\n\nSo, two points I'd like to mention which could perhaps be added somewhere into the perspectives here.\n\n<strong>1)</strong> This could be just a personal preference, but when talking about Education models with people I'm always very fond of highlighting how the Trivium/Quadrivium model used to work from the Classical World until the 17th/18th Century.\n\nThe Trivium consisted of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric. Grammar taught you the mechanics of language. Logic taught you to think critically and construct reasoned thought. Rhetoric taught you the means of communicating your thoughts effectively to others. Then the Quadrivium covered learning particular topics (at the time Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy) in detail. So, the idea was first teaching them how to learn and communicate in the best possible ways (Trivium) and only then introducing them to data-dumps (Quadrivium).\n\nEven without reinstituting this system in its entirety, the general approach is worth considering and is, I feel, sorely lacking in modern education. We don't teach students <em>how to learn</em> anymore. We go straight into filling them with facts which we expect them to vomit up on examinations. I firmly maintain that arming students with the skills that will allow them to approach in-depth knowledge with greater facility is an important, and currently missing, first step.\n\n<strong>2)</strong> We don't really seem to have an acknowledged place anymore to accomodate 'Renaissance Men'/Polymaths in any meaningful way.<a href=\"http://appliedhistory.co.uk/?p=93\"> In a piece I wrote a while back</a>, I used da Vinci as an example. Leonardo was formally trained as a painter. In his life, in addition to working as an artist, he was an anatomist, architect, engineer, mathematician, and diplomat to name but a few of his occupations.\n\nCan anybody imagine a city commissioning a painter to build a bridge nowadays? Nor can I. Yet it happened in the past, and successfully at that.\n\nWe don't seem to have a place in the world/the workforce for someone who, though bearing credentials in one thing, also happens to be incredibly competent at something else as well. Furthermore, people seem to be frequently discouraged from exploring multiple disciplines and are rather encouraged to specialise. This doesn't strike me as terribly wise.\n\nAnything we think we can do about that?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-09-06 01:11:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:12.306004", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 432, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13498, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 517, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>funding</b>\n\ndo we think that we could find a funding agency willing to cover some of the costs related to pulling this project together?\n\nI look around and see many people on here who have 1st hand experience of dealing with crisies and disasters around the globe.

I\u2019m currently working on a condensed write-up of the weekend for another site, but thought I would share some more specific (and longer) thoughts here that were generated by my/our experience.\u00a0\n\nAs Jimmy mentions in <a href=\"http://jimmytidey.co.uk/blog/lote4-the-stewardship-matera/\">his blog about the event</a>, the \u201csharing\u201d economy was a running theme throughout various sessions, and the conundrum of how to tap into excess resources while not disenfranchising those who rely on existing economic systems was at the center. Classic examples that arose include the way that car services like Uber benefit certain groups of people by letting them take cheap rides \u2013 plus potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 but it also saps taxi drivers of their livelihoods and change community dynamics. Another is of course Airbnb, which allows certain groups of people (incidentally similar groups to those who use services like Uber) to make a living to support themselves \u2013 but in the process it has driven up subletting costs in neighborhoods over the past year, and has also changed the emotional landscape of many cities by converting interpersonal interactions into profit models. Those models may benefit some in the short term but may not in the long term; in any case in the long term we can assume they will profit Silicon Valley.\n\nOne recent (bummer) example of a situation in which formalized sharing economy meets self-organized local community serves as a parable of this conundrum for me. It\u2019s <a href=\"http://uptownalmanac.com/2014/10/bros-try-kick-kids-soccer-field\">the video</a> that surfaced online of a bunch of Dropbox employees (sporting the logo on their shirts) showing up to a community soccer field in the area of San Francisco where they live and insisting that a bunch of (mostly Spanish-speaking) guys move out so they could play on the field. The justification was that there\u2019s a new system in place \u2013 which is apparently accessible via an app \u2013 by which the soccer field can be reserved in advance for a bit of cash. Up until that time, the sharing of the field had been governed by people standing around, waiting their turns, and challenging each other to games to take over the field. Stewardship in action.\n\nThe part of the example that I don\u2019t intend to draw out is that the start-up dudes act like assholes. That's not the point. The interesting part stems from the obvious irony in the fact that DropBox is a service that allows people to share files freely (for a profit, probably with surveillance on their data, but anyhow) and so directly supports the concept that rationalized, formalized systems for sharing and allocating resources are the way to go to create fairness for all. And on the surface, saving time and making things more fair via an app that allows everyone to sign up for a time slot to use the soccer field in advance is an idea that makes sense. But what looks like it could be a happy way of giving everyone access to a community asset in an organized fashion in fact creates several barriers to entry for the people who are already using the community space. To use the new system, a person would have to possess the following:\n\n1. Tacit/social knowledge that the service exists\n\n2. Access to the communication routes or technology that make participation in that system possible\n\n3. Knowledge of the English language in order to use the system\n\n4. A bit of cash in order to participate (reserving the field in advance apparently cost the DropBoxers $27)\n\n5. Belief that the new system will work and be more fair than whatever ad-hoc systems are already in place\n\nThose five factors more or less align with the factors that allow someone to become a steward of his or her community assets. To talk about stewardship is not only to talk about what the assets are and how they can be stewarded, but also who should be in charge of maintaining those assets by whatever means they see fit, whether or not those methods are deemed convenient or even fair by outsiders. Those wishing to help others learn to be stewards need to carefully balance their goal --removing barriers to entry by creating new platforms -- with the possibility of inadvertently imposing systems that create <em>new</em> barriers to entry.\n\nMany sessions at LOTE revolved around general concepts that affect all groups attempting to steward communal resources: from scaleability to replicability to membership to (non)profit models. But the tricky bit that we kept coming up against was the fact that any outside concept of stewardship invented artificially (meaning formally and with protocol) that does not arise from the community it serves, or at least in direct and long-term collaboration with that community, has implicit structural problems that cannot be tackled except for case by case.\n\nI learned a lot from Jimmy and Gaia\u2019s <a href=\"/t/using-online-tools-to-map-serve-render-visible-offline-communities/3682\">generative presentation</a> on their current project gathering information on community access to resources via both ethnographic (on the ground) and digital (data collecting via social media) means. They were gaining a complex and multifaceted understanding of a neighborhood on the periphery of London, where there apparently exist some measure of community resources \u2013 but residents did not know about or have access to them. Thus they felt isolated from each other and also from the larger metropolitan area. The researchers are now trying to find a way to apply their findings to the way the community does/doesn\u2019t organize itself in order to empower the residents, either by providing them access to information, improving communication among them, or examining the informal structures already in place and formalizing them. That last option seems to be the one that the session participants were most interested in, with possibilities including anything from turning a small informal gathering at a mosque or a park into an advertised public meet-up, or creating a transit app so people understand their own transit system better.\n\nDuring this discussion a participant from Matera brought up the issue of public transit in the city where we were all sitting. He pointed out that, while a public transit app for the Matera community does sound like a good idea from someone not familiar with the place, in fact the transit routes there are so idiosyncratic and unreliable that the lack of access to information isn\u2019t necessarily the problem; it\u2019s the system itself. Furthermore, many Materans don\u2019t have smart phones and don\u2019t want to get them, so they don\u2019t have access to the technology. He told us that what many people have already been doing for some time is organize car shares themselves via an open Facebook group. An existing social network, which formed offline, found a way to use an existing online<em> </em>social network for their own means.\n\nThe downside is that Materans who don\u2019t use Facebook (no online access) and/or who don\u2019t already have social ties to that group of people (no offline access) can\u2019t find out about or use the network. Therefore, the question became: how would it be possible to take this situation in which a community is already stewarding its own assets via an imperfect but self-organized method (just like the community who is already stewarding its own soccer field via an informalized process) and make that existing system more accessible <em>without imposing use of a particular technology or social system</em> on residents? Is there a way someone could access this service who doesn't have a computer or doesn\u2019t want to give one\u2019s personal data to Facebook? (Suggestion: what if a member of the existing group was just paid 50 bucks a week by the city government in order to create awareness and then utilize the service on behalf of residents over 60 years old? A technological solution might not be the key.)\n\nI bring up these examples \u2013 however particular they might be \u2013 because they\u2019re exactly that: specific examples. Throughout LOTE we were consistently reminded about the importance of context, about the fact that no top-down <em>or</em> bottom-up organization is going to be universally applicable. A car-sharing service in Berlin is not necessarily a good fit for London, or San Francisco, or Matera, and it shouldn\u2019t be, because that would mean that local culture is being flattened into a lump of the international creative class. That differentiation between localities means that in order to generate productive stewardship for communities it\u2019s necessary to start with the specifics and build a platform based on them, rather than the other way around. A lot of problems stem from creating umbrella models to address situations perceived to be universal. The tough part is that it takes a lot of time to gain the tacit knowledge needed to understand what makes a given situation so particular. The importance of speaking the local language cannot be understated in this regard.\n\nMany mentioned that it would be ideal for unMon to stay rooted in Matera for many years to come \u2013 so it could not only learn from its mistakes (which it is doing with Bembo &amp; Katalin\u2019s beautifully written and comprehensive Book of them) but apply them precisely within the context in which they were discovered. While it\u2019s useful and important to learn from others\u2019 experiences, the same lessons learned at unMon aren\u2019t at all template to be applied elsewhere. Many sessions were occupied with the scale-ability of the unMonastery (as well as EdgeRyders in general), as well as the question of what to do with the unMonastery name in the event that it becomes perceived as a brand that anyone could potentially slap onto their communal living project.Should it be replicated? Is there a responsibility that the original members have to make sure it\u2019s replicated in a certain way? Would that necessarily define an inside and an outside, or a dogmatic way of doing things? How can knowledge about stewardship be shared without imposing that knowledge as a rule across very different communities? The ethical implications of those decisions on existing local communities will have to be considered.\n\nPS\u00a0 - The <a href=\"http://https://lote4.hackpad.com/Art-Vs-Science-WCxT1nE8unW\">hackpad</a> on Helen/Jimmy\u2019s discussion on the art/science binary gets to a lot of this.\u00a0thanks guys.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-29 17:22:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:21.135078", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1840, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 8, 1687], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12292, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5036, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>No other way that I know of..</b>\n\nCurrently I see the social media feed picks <a href=\"/en/admin/structure/views/view/social_media_feed/edit/feed\">both</a> posts and events type content, so conversion into events seems to be great.

So let's rediscover the wealth we have: hidden in our homes and abilities, there's a lot we can provide that others need, and a lot that others can provide that we need. Such large-scale barter was impossible to organize until now, but just reach into your pocket and you'll find a tool that is very good in connecting people, and has the computing power to provide cashless economy: a smartphone.\"</em>\n\n<strong>Imagine \u2026</strong>\n\nImagine we could solve most of unemployment by letting everybody download a working economy as an app that we can just start to use. We\u2019re not yet there, but we\u2019re working on it :-) Here\u2019s a typical scenario:\n\nImagine a group of 30+ economically deprived but tech literate and motivated people. For example, the young and unemployed in a self-governed social center in crisis-struck Spain. They might find the Economy App by themselves, or a visitor might tell them. A group of them meets one evening to start trying it out. So everybody downloads and installs this app, and people might help each other out with their old spare smartphones.\n\nNow they celebrate the begin of their alternative economy, as everybody is literally pressing a big green \u201cStart the Economy\u201d button in their Economy App.\n\n<strong>Connecting Offers and Wants, but Without Cash and Credit </strong>\n\nThe apps on all the interconnected smartphones immediately begin to work, and start to ask their users some questions each: about what they could offer in a local economy \u2013 and that can be anything from home-made cheese to carpooling, used furnitures, computer support and any other product and service that can reasonably be provided in a home or small business setting.\n\nUsers can also add more offers any time later, and the app plays its full strength by supporting this with special tools not available on regular computers: adding a product photo in five seconds with the internal camera, scanning books and other barcodes to get product descriptions from a product database. Offering 20 services and 200 items would be a good average per person, and should not take more than one afternoon. Note that offers can have one of a few simple types, for which additional features are provided: \u201cfor sale\u201d, \u201cfor lending\u201d, \u201cfor sharing\u201d, \u201cas a gift\u201d, all either geolocalized or with shipping.\n\nThen also, the app starts asking the users what they <em>want</em>. What their economic needs are. This is done by users registering their interest in the offers that others entered before.\n\nNow, the magic happens: The software connects people to fulfill each others needs by each others offers. But not by direct barter, which is mostly impossible because of the \u201cdouble coincidence of wants\u201d problem, but by what we call \u201cnetwork barter\u201d. One or two network barter deals will be generated per day, and in each one the software includes all people who can be fit in based on their current offers and wants.\n\nThe software keeps the value of products and services provided and accepted in balance for every person in this economic network: so compensation happens in kind and just in time, and no money ever needs to change hands. This economy is free from limitations of personal liquidity and creditworthiness, and thus can also work for the financially poor. And to some degree, all economies under austerity measures are financially poor: austerity made money a much scarcer good, and is a burden for money-based economies.\n\nIn total, this would provide compensated jobs for everybody involved \u2013 it can\u2019t completely replace the formal money-based economy, but should generate enough income as a main or side job to allow again more decent living conditions.\n\nA nice side effect that this app will produce is to make work \u201csocial\u201d again: you\u2019re no longer captive in your cubicle, knowing only your colleagues, but you will regularly interact economically with new people, mostly from your local area. Along the way, you can make new friends. And the software supports it by offering people potentially fitting new offers \u201clike a dating site offers new matches\u201d, and by celebrating deals and other business activity as a social experience, like exemplified by <a href=\"http://en.dawanda.com/\">DaWanda</a> for craftswork.\n\nIf the bottom line is that ordinary people can not only work their way out of widespread economic crisis, without money, but even have fun doing so, that\u2019s more than a simple app could ever dream about \u2026\n\n<strong>Hidden Complexity</strong>\n\nOf course, this description, and the app itself, hides a lot of complexity. That\u2019s good, as it makes this \u201cNew Deal\u201d economy simple to deal with. But for those who want to know how it all works, here\u2019s some technical background:\n\nA serverside application to which all the smartphones connect to has the complex task to generate \u201cmulti-party deals\u201d based on the economy members\u2019 network of offers and wants. The basic idea follows the <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmb/files/cmb-general.pdf/download\">idea of Circular Multilateral Barter</a> (CMB), but with two additions. First, the multi-party barter does not have to be circle shaped, but can be any kind of graph structure that fulfills this \u201cbreak even\u201d condition, including so-called \u201csplit and merge deals\u201d. Second, these added barter types allow the system to operate completely without credits, also without P2P credits among friends, which can be problematic depending on culture. So in every barter deal that somebody gets involved in, the amount of good and services to provide and to get is always the same; that is, except for a low user-configurable \u201cacceptable loss\u201d that allows to get more deals by not requiring exact value matching.\n\nFinding multi-party barter deals in this network structure of wants and offers is a challenging algorithmic problem. There\u2019s still a lot room for optimization (and we welcome contributions from interested mathematicians), but it seems that we are able to produce a sufficient solution already. It involves <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking\">backtracking</a>, evolutionary algorithms and a solid amount of computing power.\n\nWhile this app can work reasonably well in groups of 30 and larger, it is more useful the more people use it (so-called network effect). Spreading this app is one of the key challenges, if we really want to change the future of work in Europe to a brighter one. We\u2019ll start small, prototype in local projects, but will also try achieve the viral spreading through creative and unconventional \u201cmarketing\u201d and good storytelling.\n\nSome more tools and techniques are needed in addition to CMB magic, but luckily, there are many existing initiatives which can be connected: community gardening projects for local production; a P2P reputation system; cooperative structures for founding and managing larger projects that emerge from a local economy.\n\nThe app will be aware of the legal regulations at each location, and informs the users accordingly. In Greece for example, all alternative economic activity is tax-exempt, as they realized that LETS local currencies etc. are valuable tools to ease an economic crisis. In other countries,the legal situation is more complex, but there is always a way to comply with tax regulations. In most cases, registering a small business and paying tax for your barter deals, documented with regular invoices, is a working option. If then you need cash money only to pay your taxes, it\u2019s still a huge improvement over the current situation where you need cash money for near everything.\n\n<strong>More information, and an invitation to an open project</strong>\n\nThis idea is under constant further development, which happens at the webspace of the friendly grassroots think and action tank <a href=\"http://www.edgeryders.eu/\">Edgeryders</a>, in group <a href=\"http://www.edgeryders.eu/economy-app/faq\">Economy App</a>. I have been working on alternative economy systems for some years now, but I have to admit that I still constantly can find improvements for these ideas. And I welcome your feedback and contributions \u2013 this is an open project, and the app will be open source! For example, I\u2019m seeking more input for cultural aware design of this Economy App idea (see this <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/interview-struggling-with-crisis-in-spain\">interview on my blog</a> for a valuable example).\n\n<span><strong>Image credits:</strong> Original image of smartphone image by flickr user fd, published as <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/john/4029847429/\">flickr image 4029847429</a> under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial 2.0 Licence</a>.

Building an alternative, inclusive \"social security system\", that defies state and traditional labour market mechanisms, thus ending the dichotomy \"Employed/unEmployed\" in the long term.

Identifying or building alternative currencies (based on real value, or, to use an older term, \"use\" value, whilst not excluding the traditional currency (Euro, Dollar, whatever) from the outset. I'm not thinking of returning to\"local\" currencies but of creating purpose-bound, but nonetheless transnational \"currencies\", building massive resistance to the ongoing trend of commodification of everything you can think of.\n\nA currency that doesn't get in the way, or blocks potentials, like money so often does, but rather clears the way, unLocking potentials.\n\n3.

Identify groups\u00a0 (communities) that have already made efforts (voluntarily or forced into) to build alternative safety nets (in the old days, those were unions, today there are unEmployed and homeless associations, precarious workers, the victims of wage slavery put in place by outsourcing and temporary work agencies, etc.), talk to them, build on experiences that they have made, what does work, what doesn't.\n\n6.

Vinay, through hexayurt building, and Darren through an Open-Source Hardware mailing list.\n\nDarren needed someone who could do arc-welding for version 0.2 of the biochar-rocket stove, and i put him in touch with the most effective welder i knew.\n\nVinay, i met through building a hexayurt for Hackney City Farm, and we've been gossiping about technology since.\n\nI'll update my biog, when i've got time. Trying to condense over 30 years worth of professional activity into a couple of paragraphs isn't exactly easy, if you want it to be accurate.It's even more tricky when you've been working in the variety and range of the fields of endeavour that i've been exploring... :))\n\nOver the last five years, i've been working on tool-making. As i said earlier, making the tools to make the tools that we need to thrive.\n\nNote, i used to say \"to survive\", then someone pointed out to me, that if you're just covering the bills, you're eventually going to lose, as you won't have the energy surplus to deal with the inevitable entropy that'll\u00a0 be affecting whatever infrastructure you are using. That's why i say \"to thrive\" rather than \"to survive\". Build in the future-proofing, and the capability for future upgrades, from\u00a0 the start, and it'll make the upgrades along the tech-tree you're following, simpler to realise.\n\nPractical example: I've been a member of the London Hackspace\u00a0<a href=\"http://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk\">http://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk</a> for nearly five years, and i spent a large amount of time working on the workshop infrastructure. This was purely an example of enlightened group self-interest. I needed a workshop that could do specific things, so i helped build it, and because it was me that was building it, we ended up with a workshop that was mostly ideal for my purposes.\n\nI've been working on a wind-turbine design on-and-off for a few years. I needed to build an alternator that would work for the low-wind conditions that were the optimum for this design of turbine. (NB, i've been doing this entirely self-funded and self-boot-strapped, hence the making it, rather than buying components in. It also means i learn more when doing this.)\n\nI needed to use the mini-lathe at the hackspace, in order to make the frames for the alternator coils. The lathe was a mess, as it hadn't been used for 3 months, and hadn't been cleaned for 6. My reaction was \"Cool! Here's the opportunity to learn how to maintain a lathe.\" So i downloaded a maintenance manual for this lathe from the manufacturer's website, stripped it down, cleaned it, put it back together, then when testing it, found that there were a couple of parts that needed replacing.\n\nLathes are interesting devices, in that you can use a lathe to make another lathe, so in theory, i should have been able to make the spare parts.\n\nIn practise, i could have ordered the parts from China but they would have taken 6-8 weeks to be delivered, and they would have cost real money. Instead i used the kiln that was in the hackspace workshop, spent two days learning how to use that, bought some jeweller's crucibles from a local suppler, then spent the next 7 days, experimenting with melting aluminium, using scrap from broken bike wheels, and the cases from broken hard disk drives. We also had to take another side-track to make some of the moulding equipment for performing sand-casting, and the moulding bench, so we could pour it safely.\n\nWe then, 3d-printed the parts from a lathe design i'd found on Thingiverse,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12472\">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12472</a> and used them as forms for sand-moulding, and cast the new parts out of aluminium.\n\nSo two weeks after starting, we ended up with a working lathe, a set of metal-casting equipment, and the practical experience in how to use this stuff.\n\nAnd then i finally made the coil-frames i'd originally set out to make... :))\n\nI also, ended up teaching four members of the hackspace, how to do basic metal-casting, and started building a furnace to be able to cast larger things. Version 0.1 ended up looking like this, <a href=\"https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Project:GingeryFurnace\">https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Project:GingeryFurnace</a>\n\nIt was made completely out of recycled materials, <a href=\"http://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/File:ItsMadeOutOfRubbish.jpg\">http://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/File:ItsMadeOutOfRubbish.jpg</a> The body of the furnace was a broken bucket, lined with fireclay, that was made from skip-found builders sand, vermiculite that we were given by a grower i knew, and spare clay from a local pottery. The air intake was a piece of rusty scaffolding tube that i'd rescued from a skip. The air blower was a spare computer fan that was roaming around the workshop, and using an air-focuser, similar to a Venturi nozzle, that was knocked together out of a PVC pipe that i'd found in a skip. The power system was made from the entrails of a broken vacuum cleaner, and the entire thing was fueled using FSC charcoal from Lidl's which cost \u00a32 a bag!\n\nBecause the furnace was made from recycled materials, and the charcoal was FSC certified, it meant that the entire thing was carbon-neutral, and cost nothing but a little time and effort. Add in a battery-powered 12V fan, and a solar-panel to charge it, and you have a system to make machine-tools that can work off-grid.\n\nWith version 0.1 of the furnace, we were able to get mild steel up to 950C, which is mid-orange-with-a-touch-of-white, which is a effective temperature for hammer-shaping steel. Once we repaired the vacuum-cleaner motor, we were able to use that for version 0.2. We were able to get a flame that was nearly 5 feet high, and reached temperature of over 1250C, which is the sparkly stage where the carbon in your steel catches fire. \"I've just destroyed the last hour's work, but we've built an excellent furnace\"\n\nAnd we were getting those temperatures with just an open bucket! :))\n\nI've been working on version 0.3 using a skip-found beer barrel, and with better air-flow, we'll be able to cast bronze. It's a material i not played with before. More to learn... :D\n\nAfter meeting Darren, and helping him with the biochar-rocket-stove, it's going to be possible to improve the charcoal supplies, so it can be completely carbon neutral, and self-sustaining, for as long as you're able to maintain the land you're running the forest on.\n\nAnd this was just one of the bright idea's we've been working on... :D\n\nThere's a whole 'nother range of wyrdness there... :))\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-17 14:32:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:34.384873", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1282, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6541, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6385, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>ping Owen</b>\n\n@Owen did I get it right?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-16 13:53:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:38.404592", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4165, "user_id": 264, "topic_id": 4132, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n<span><b>FLOSS4P2P: Call for Participation</b></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>A 2-day London workshop in March, gathering <b>FLOSS projects</b> that are building software for <b>peer production and organization</b>, with a focus on <b>distributed</b> platforms.\u00a0</span><b style=\"line-height: 1.38; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;\">Scholarships</b><span> to attend are offered to grassroots communities.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>** Context **</span>\n\n<span>We know that the Internet was </span><span>originally decentralized</span><span>, with protocols and services built by hackers.

Loosing ourselfs in the routine of daylife. Most of us even forget the impact our actions. Driven by an extrinsic motivation, pushing people into the need of \u00a0\"gainful employment\u201d.\n\nWe've created and still supporting a system which turns out beeing kind of psychopat. It's a system based on the fear. The idea of not becoming enough. For what else reason should I then trade, istead of sharing? I'm not wanting to condemn, but whiching to have a view on trading itself in condicion of time groups.\n\nThis article isn\u2019t claming to be scientific. Just tryn to questionizing some strongly ancord habits. :-)\n\n\u2026.but before having a view on trading I would like to go a step further. Because what is needed before beeing able to trade is property. Property itself can be understood as something taken from the comon. It\u2019s a resource holded by private/group until accepted trade occurs. Two maigor(possible) problems can be apier from that. Obviosly as soon as there are enough people trading, it creates a force. Resources you\u2019re mainly able to resieve are needed to be in exchange. It\u2019s creating a \u201cneed\u201d to search for trading oportunities for your own service. Which is then aswell creating a extrinsic motivation, which then turns in modern markets in a direction where people following \u00a0\u201coportunities for a trade\u201d instead of activities intrinsic motivated. Like that I find my self where a lot\u2019s people doing jobs they would never do under \u201cnormal condicions\u201d. Having more \u201cmarketpower\u201d is then directly related to having more power over people.\n\nThere might be many solutions to declining this trend. Me personly resonate quiet strongly to those related to the gifteconomy. Somehow I have the feeling while creating a gifteconomy it\u2019s at the same work on all the habbits which let the world look like how it is now.\n\nIt\u2019s about sharing and collaboration instead of sensless competition. Same as it creates trust and connections towards each other.\n\nTaking care about something (someone) \u201cjust\u201d because you want to. You do because you love to help and because you\u2019re passionated about.\n\nBut what if not enough people think like that? The world is already full of volunteers. And once more resources are free available again, more could do so.<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n\u00a0\n\nStarting with food:\n\nEverything you\u2019ll like to do not alone you need people. Nothing more brings people that easy together then food. Everybody needs to eat. To have this resource free available could be a big step.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile 30-40% of all produced food is wasted a good start is about preventing the waste while sharing the saved food freely. In Germany there\u2019s since about 3 years a movent existing called foodsharing just doing exactly this. In this very moment we\u2019re working on to turn it international. While this movment started from the idea of saving food, there\u2019s still the main focus on. Step by step I would like to create a bigger focus direction eatable cities, community supported agricultre and freeGardens.\n\nIf anybody is interested in here, just conntact me. :-)\n\nSharing everything (you like to). For that we\u2019re working on a open source multible sharing platform called yunity.org. But it\u2019s not \u201conly\u201d about creating a plattform, it\u2019s on the same about creating/supporting a social architecture brining people together with a focus on collaration.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce the MVP of the plattform is finished it will be used in first to turn foodsharing into a international movement. \u00a0\n\nStatement about communitys:\n\n...just some in every contry with the same intention, well connected could easily create momentum.\n\nCreating community/movement:\n\nI\u2019m \u00a0looking for a team of 9-30 activists, interested in playing oasis game simliar settings, while traveling together and being filmed.\n\nI will start with in Europe. (if someone likes to do same/simliar somewhere else: DO IT! :-))\n\nDo we need money?\n\nOne of the only reason why we may feel like, is of having a lack of connections. Once a network is big enough it\u2019s self-supporting. :-)\n\nThat\u2019s something I\u2019m highly interested to work on.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-27 07:01:18", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 14:19:29.551213", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 772, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5226, "user_id": 3021, "topic_id": 5193, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I would love to share the story of Veg'N'Fast with you .\n\n<em>It all started with a crazy idea.</em>\n\n<em>Let's take a Fast-Food, keep the working business concept (Snacks delivered rapidly) and rework everything around it, more than that, make it all energy efficient/cycled, Veg' and Local.</em>\n\n-The project is to re-imagine the supply chains of the joint to guarantee a Local, Traceable and Organic (up to 150km in winter, less than 20km in summer) supply.

I am a curious observer, networker and \u00a0architect. I have always loved to travel and get surprised by people and things. What I am in this moment is a mix of my professional background (architecture degree), my personal attitude (curiosity and openness to people) and love to explore the world. I started to travel around the world when I was 12 years old. I started going to UK for 4 weeks for an english summer course. From that moment I am still on the way. I studied (Australia/Perth and Chile/Santiago), and worked abroad too (China/Shanghai and UK/London). In 2005 when I finished university I won a grant to be part of Unidee / University of Ideas at <a href=\"http://www.cittadellarte.it/\">Cittadellarte / Fondazione Pistoletto</a> in Italy / Biella. Working on ideas and creative projects about responsible change in society. It last 4 months then I got the opportunity to work with the \"Maestro\" Michelangelo Pistoletto.\u00a0But I was still on my way to understand what I wanted to do and I gave space to my \"architectural\" part and for some years I worked at international firms. I found myself too much limited inside these environments. No space to express myself, too many boundaries toward possible ideas.\u00a0 With the big economic crises of 2008 I was made redounded twice in one year and I decided to start to work on my ideas with no limits. While running a project for a private client, I was looking for some information on <a href=\"http://www.worldchanging.com/\">Worldchanging</a> and came across the idea of <a href=\"http://the-hub.net/\">The Hub</a> as a different kind of co-working place. They were opening a space in Milan and I wrote them. They invited me to be part of the process of the co-design and that gave me the opportunity to share, learn and experiment new ideas on how design a collaborative environments. Going through different co-design projects, like the <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2011/06/19/the-hub-rovereto-by-andrea-paoletti/\">Hub Rovereto</a>, The <a href=\"http://hubbayarea.wordpress.com/2011/06/07/hub-co-design-big-bang/\">Hub San Francisco</a> and The\u00a0Hub Oaxaca, I understand that they are long term processes and no one can teach you how to design them, you must learn by doing. That's really about my attitude!\u00a0The co-design method requires a mixed and participatory approach involving people from different fields. This approach acknowledges complexity and seeks not to simplify process and outcome but to explore the set of unpredictable and surprising ideas that emerge from combining different ideas and points of view. Furniture and space design plays a critical role in determining how people behave and can have a hugely positive effect on encouraging collaboration and serendipity. Space can be a tool to fuel the creative process by encouraging and discouraging specific behaviors/actions and by creating venues for emotional expression and physical negotiation. The space can be designed to build excitement and inspire creativity in work people. And through this process, businesses can get inspired, connect and evolve. Living in San Francisco I started my own <a href=\"http://uuushh.com/\">blog</a> where I visited various companies the wrote about their collaborative environments and now I would like to start to visit European companies and social innovation spaces in order to help them to develop their workplaces. Working between entrepreneurs stimulated my creativity towards creating my own projects. I matched my love for outdoor activities and food and I started a catering <a href=\"http://lacascinabianca.wordpress.com/\">project</a> that use vegetables grown and harvested by my father in our vegetable garden and prepared by my mum. A sustainable project that works with the nature. And in these days I am working on a new project about co-working surrounded in nature that I want to start in south Italy and spread around the world.<strong> </strong>I still do not know \u201cwhere\u201d I am going, but I fully believe in what I am doing, <strong>I follow my guts</strong>, gotten inspired by people and the world around me. I have no security at all but share has become the base of my life and everyday I learn infinite things. Awesome!\u00a0My first big question at the moment is \"Would you like to go into the nature and work from there? What kind of service do you think you would need and why?\". Second big question...\"which company would you suggest me to go visiting because of its collaborative attitude? Or which company do you think they would need to become more collaborative in order to implement their success (that doesn't mean only from the economic point of view!). Waiting for your suggestions!\n\n", "created_at": "2011-11-19 22:16:37", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 09:38:59.945302", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 827, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1368, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1335, "post_number": 1, "raw": "For this mission \"<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/making-living/spotlight-social-innovation\">Spotlight: social innovation</a>\" of Making a Living Campaign, here is what was asked: <em>\"Find and describe a socially innovative company, initiative or project near you (if possible, interview the social innovator who made it possible) that you find inspiring. Do you think it has a chance to actually make the world a little better? Why</em>?\"\n\n*****************************************************************\n\nThere is COMMUNAUTIQUE (<a href=\"http://www.communautique.qc.ca/\">http://www.communautique.qc.ca/</a>) , in <u>Montreal, Quebec, <strong>CANADA</strong></u>. Communautique is a community organization whose mission is to support citizen participation by promoting information literacy, ownership of information technology and communications and contributing to their development.\n\nI already went there, and spoke to one of their researchers and to the administrative leader of this organisation. I think that open government issues should be promoted via this channel. But they don\u2019t have enough human and financial resources to accept one more project. It did not fit their method of internal operations, which seems somewhat closed.\n\nIn the past, I found myself in a situation where I did all the field work with an organization of a more experimental nature (AADRAV), because the existing organization in place did not handle the work, did not get involved (RAAV). The result was that the government provided half a million dollars to RAAV as assistance to solving the problems that I raised during two pretty intense years of lobbying, with annual funding extended to lifetime, and managing my projects that I could no longer continue to lead, because there was a legal problem. We disputed this legal problem all the way to Superior court: AADRAV against RAAV. And we lost, because the law stated that there can only be one artist organization. The winner was not the one who did all the hard work and mobilized the entire community. The winner was the one who was the older structure and did nothing.\n\nI would rather die than see this happen to me again.\n\n*****************************************\n\nMy heart still strongly belongs to GOVERNMENT IN THE LAB (<a href=\"http://govinthelab.com/\">http://govinthelab.com/</a>), in <u>Wintrop, Massachussetts, <strong>UNITED STATES</strong></u>. Parting with it was pretty heartbreaking. I shed many tears. This Summer, we had to postpone our plans, because of lack of funds. If there was somewhere on this Earth, a government institution that could provide financial support to open government initiatives, and hire us as consultants, I would love to go back to TheLab. If, if, if.\n\n*****************************************\n\nThere is the GOVERNMENT OF QUEBEC, in <u>Quebec, <strong>CANADA</strong></u>. I really enjoyed my conversations with Deputy House Leader Henri-Fran\u00e7ois Gautrin (<a href=\"http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/deputes/gautrin-henri-francois-1051/index.html\">http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/deputes/gautrin-henri-francois-1051/index.html</a>). We get along well (my humble opinion). We even discovered that our fathers worked together on building the highway 40 connecting Montreal to Quebec City. We have previous genealogical connections. If the government could decide itself to launch an open government initiative, perhaps there would be room for me somewhere in their teams, or in a firm of consultants, like Loran Technologies. But there is no current open government project. Business opportunities are very slim. If, if, if.\n\n*****************************************\n\nNext to this, there is the OPEN GOVERNMENT AND FRANCOPHONIE project. If Innovation and Economic Development of the City of Three Rivers (<a href=\"http://www.idetr.com/fr/index.aspx\">http://www.idetr.com/fr/index.aspx</a>) could miraculously change its mind, or if some other or several funding organizations could give a hand, and if several Francophone governments agreed to collaborate, we might be able to consider the financing of a new social business, to carry this multilateral partnership project. And we even could consider building a relationship with the existing Open Government Partnership (from United Nations). If, if, if\u2026 Sigh. (<u>This project only exists in dreams.</u>)\n\n*****************************************\n\nAnother project floating in my mind is OPEN GOVERNMENT 2060. I would like to attach this project to a group of governments, government organization, research laboratory, whatever. As far as it allowed to look toward what open government should tend to, trends, avenues and solutions, how it can be transformed in beneficial ways. (<u>This project only exists in dreams.</u>)\n\n*****************************************\n\nAnother path I would love to explore is finding a way to get involved in a community like the INSTITUTE OF NOETIC SCIENCES (<a href=\"http://noetic.org/\">http://noetic.org/</a>), in <u>California, <strong>UNITED STATES</strong></u>. This institute was founded by Apollo 14 astronaut <strong>Edgar Mitchell (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Mitchell\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Mitchell</a>). </strong>As he approached the planet we know as home, he was filled with an inner conviction as certain as any mathematical equation he'd ever solved. He experienced Oneness. This experience radically altered his worldview: despite science's superb technological achievements, he realized that we had barely begun to probe the deepest mystery of the universe\u2014the fact of consciousness itself. Within two years of his expedition, Edgar Mitchell founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences in 1973.\n\nThis institute gathered thinkers from all over the world this summer, like Dr Deepak Chopra (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepak_Chopra\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepak_Chopra</a>), and I just would have loved to attend the 14th international IONS conference. A positive shift in human evolution is underway and beginning to reshape our future. And while humanity faces numerous unprecedented challenges, it has the tools at hand to find resolution, renewal. Connectedness is no longer the exception to the rule. New technologies have created new expectations about how we engage one another, how we work, how we learn, and even how we play. They gathered a stellar collection of inspiring, thoughtful, and visionary people to address this unique moment in our collective unfolding. Chopra gave a keynote on \u2018Harnessing our power to change the world\u2019. \u00a0\n\nI would like to meet this collection of people, talk with them, explore with them.\n\n(Please don\u2019t laugh) One day, I would like to work with people like Deepak Chopra on open government projects.\n\nI would like to meet the astronaut who founded this institute, and other people who had experiences of oneness, who are in a physical state of consciousness, like me. I don\u2019t have anyone to talk about this stuff right now, besides reading in books and daily watching Deepak Chopra on YouTube. I need a master. Someone that can help me, guide me, to pursue my exploration of consciousness. I could still figure it out by myself, but a guide would be great.\n\n*****************************************\n\nAnother option, that strangely really attracts me, is becoming a monk. Going to a MONASTERY, <u>somewhere on a lonely mountain</u>, sit and be. And don\u2019t talk. This would be wonderful! This lifestyle would be absolutely perfect for me, and I would probably reach in no time the last step of spiritual development that awaits me. Learn the trick of the cloak of invisibility by intoxication of love and raising my body vibrations. Vanish from the face of this Earth (houla, stop feeling out of the box), and connect with individuals exploring higher states of being. But I must however scrap this option, because I am a single mother of a 6 years old son, and I am solely responsible for his development. Maybe this option will become possible for me in 20 years from now. There is the possibility that I can still reach the last level of consciousness without becoming a monk. I did \u00be of the way without even doing one hour of meditation. It was a spontaneous experience. I can also postpone this goal to another life incarnation. I know now that I was destined to become what I am since I was very little. I felt higher vibrations and energy running through my veins at a very young age. Naive as I am, I thought I had very poor blood circulation...\n\nAs long as I can remember, I strove for awakening. Personal development is my Number One priority. The more I position myself in projects with global reach, international projects, and the more my thoughts are busy trying to help others, the more my body mental vibrations rise.\n\nPut me in the right context, and I might have the chance of reach the last level. I really would like to achieve the final beatitude. And once I get \u200b\u200bhere, I will have access to even more knowledge and consciousness, and I will have more love, and I will be able to help even more.\n\n<em>And the two will become One Flesh. So they are no longer two, but One. Mark 10:8</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-08 19:26:24", "updated_at": "2017-09-20 17:12:58.135976", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1544, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2816, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2783, "post_number": 1, "raw": "If you skipped those, here's a recap..\u00a0\n\n<em>This page is a wiki, so if you were there feel free to edit\u00a0it.

As we were in the usual Monday online call for Building the unMonastery track at LOTE, it came up that their organizational team is now [pulling itself together](/t/1910). @ilariadauria, @paolo_d_ercole and Fabio @invisigot are the new facilitators of Communication and Community.\n\nSo the obvious question arose: can and should we be coordinating between unMonastery and LOTE3 social media updates? The unMonastery already constitutes a large part of building engagement around LOTE and communicating the event to the people in Matera, and there is common content pushed out through the Edgeryders and unMon individual Facebook and Twitter accounts. The event in Matera is bringing all of us together, and so it makes sense that we work as one team, rather than duplicating efforts. \n\nSo Ilaria, Fabio, Paolo, I dont know if the three of you are already coordinating, but if you need a space and a built in infrastructure here's a proposal:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>We have a <a href=\"/lote-social-media-team\">social media group </a>here on Edgeryders where everyone who wants to help spread Lote3 news is invited. Over 40 people registered for Lote have said so. You too can join the group, <strong>Subscribe</strong> to be officially part of the team and press <strong>Follow</strong> to be notified with updates.</li>\n\n<li>On the <a href=\"/t/lote-3-social-media-calendar/1809\">social media calendar</a> wiki any of us can suggest daily items of content - new Edgeryders blog posts, Lote session proposals, what a community member is saying about Lote that makes the event look exciting, unMonastery international call etc.</li>\n\n<li>There is a mailing list with everyone of the social media volunteers, including those who are not active in our platform group, where Dorotea sends the daily news to be spread, based on the calendar with a unique goo.gl short link so that we can monitor reach of our efforts (through number of clicks). see <a href=\"/t/team-performance-13-19-august/1866\">example</a> </li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI would love to see you guys making use of all these channels and ask for help where you need it - eg maybe someone here can help you build the press pack for unMonastery if they see a call? Also, there are lots of Italians here, and it would be useful to have some Lote updates translated in Italian when they are relevant to the community in Matera. The default encouragement is to use \\#lote3 #unMonastery AND \\#MT2019 when pushing out content, but I am surely not doing a great job following the \\#MT2019 conversations, so any liaison between us and Materani that is highly visible on social media would be a great addition to how the team works.. \n\nSo, what's it gonna be?

I monasteri benedettini hanno ricoperto l\u2019Europa intera in tre secoli senza un piano per farlo, perch\u00e9 le comunit\u00e0 che usavano la Regola tendevano a sopravvivere, prosperare e riprodursi distribuendo copie della Regola da usare in nuovi monasteri. Allo stesso modo, unMonastery scala concentrandosi sulla produzione di una non-Regola per fondare e gestire altri unMonasteries. Essa contiene specifiche sui ruoli da riempire, il design degli spazi (che influenza le interazioni che in quegli spazi avvengono), le tradizioni da osservare per ottenere insediamenti prosperi e inseriti nelle loro comunit\u00e0 locali.

Riutilizzo, condivisione, autoproduzione sono il tipo di attivit\u00e0 che orientano la ricerca di un modello autosufficiente economicamente, in cui i ricavi sono ricavati inizialmente dal dono o in cambio di consulenze;\u00a0poi grazie alla vendita, a minor costo, dei beni e servizi sperimentati durante le residenze. Siccome questi rispondono a sfide locali segnalate dai cittadini, \u00e8 plausibile che essi abbiano mercato. Esempi dei primi progetti selezionati: un app che d\u00e0 informazioni in tempo reale sul trasporto pubblico, una rete mesh progettata, gestita e posseduta da una community (community digital assets); un programma open source per orientare i pannelli solari.

Al lato, altri soggetti si stanno facendo avanti: sviluppatori di software (per la documentazione e la messa in rete con altri unMonasteries), facilitatori e connettori (per guadagnarsi il supporto della comunit\u00e0 locale), fundraiser e sostenitori che costruiscono loro stessi le condizioni per auto-impiegarsi: i contratti sono equi perch\u00e9 vengono scritti dagli stessi lavoratori.

The arrested people in the police stations were all charged with hooliganism and their phones are taken away so they have no contact with the outside world. Their requests for a lawyer have not been satisfied. @Enli offered her services as a lawyer in case someone need it.\n\nSome journalists and cameramen were arrested too and lots of equipment was broken/damaged or confiscated. Lots of injured people in the hospitals. The whole city is full of police both in uniforms and under cover.\u00a0\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e9f85eeb7453421e4a1f589eb41883f64c0a5593.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"458\"><br>\n\nWe are gathering at 6 PM at the Freedom Square (alternatively Northern Avenue or Russian Embassy if Freedom square remains blocked by the police as of now) and continue the protest against the rise of the tariff on electricity by 17-22 percent from August 1, 2015. The rumor is it is going to be violent(i hope not as I'm going to be with my 2 y.o. daughter) and people want to demand the resignation of the current government of Serj Sarkissian which is corrupt and manipulated by the Russian government<span>.</span>\n\nThere is a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1416322305362535/1416337462027686/\">facebook group</a> for the meeting tonight but other than that people are not organised and there is no plan for action. There is <a href=\"http://organize-now.am/am/2013/02/25/3536/\">a website in Armenian</a>\u00a0explaining how to behave in case one is arrested during the demonstrations and other useful information for activists.\u00a0\n\nIf someone has a constructive idea of what can be done, do not hesitate to share.\u00a0\n\nI will keep you posted.\u00a0\n\nAnna\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-23 09:54:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:25.937029", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 466, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 105.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1334, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1301, "post_number": 1, "raw": "As I think back on my allies in making my transition from teenager to independent adult and beyond, I can distinguish two phases.\n\nIn the first phase, my main ally was my family. They only did one thing, but a very important one: they supported me while I was at university, until my first degree. So far so good.\n\nIn the second phase, starting at age 21-22, I found allies in a string of university professors that encouraged me to try out some out-of-the-box thinking, and helped me to create a context in which that could happen. It all started when I was still an undergraduate. My Industrial Organization teacher, <a href=\"http://www.economia.unimore.it/sezioni/pag319.aspx?id=726&amp;liv=3&amp;numpag=319\">Sebastiano Brusco</a>, asked me if I already had a supervisor for my thesis. Actually yes, I had been speaking to one of the teachers. \"Do what you want - he said - but if you want to it with me, I would be interested. I would put you to work on environmental economics, which I am becoming interested in.\" I could not pass on that. Environmental economics was almost unheard of in a peripheral university in 1987! So we did the thesis together. As the work came to a close, he asked me what I was going to do once I graduated. I said I wanted to go into journalism (I worked as a part-time journalist during university). \"Do what you want - he said - but I think you would be making a mistake if you did not go into research. When you are through with your army service look me up, I think I can find you something to do.\" I did, and ended up a researcher in environmental economics. Later, Sebastiano and three of his former students (me included) started a small research company in that area that still exists. Later still, when I decided I needed to go back to school, Sebastiano helped me look for a scholarship and recommended I do a certain M.Sc. course at University College London.\n\nMuch later, after a long foray into, uh, <a href=\"http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Cottica\">rock music</a>, I decided to go back to economic research. My old teachers, whom I had stayed in touch with, invited me to a seminar held by an American historian-mathematician-statistician (!) called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Lane_%28scientist%29\">David Lane</a>. At first I was extremely scepical: I just could not even understand his terminology. Ontological uncertainty? Agent-artifact space? Scaffolding structures? But I\u00a0 was intrigued enough to look it up, and so I came into contact with the radically interdisciplinary approach to science associated with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_fe_institute\">Santa Fe Institute</a> (whence David comes). David did not mind me nosing around his stuff, and told me I was welcome to go along to his Ph.D. courses, though I was not enrolled. For a while I tried to put David's thinking into practice with my own work as an independent economist. That went reasonably well, but it was clear that I needed a more structured way of thinking: I needed theory. And I conceived this completely crazy idea that you can design emergent social dynamics in online communities. \"Designing emergence\" is almost a contradiction in terms, a little like \"whitening black\" or \"cooling heat\", but I was able to come up with a research strategy that sounds promising enough: it entails creating a software for augmenting online community management that I call <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2011/09/15/dragon-trainer-begins/\">Dragon Trainer</a>. So I talked to David, and he went: \"Great! I am not sure you can do this at all, but let's try anyway\". He offered me to bake my idea into in some research projects he had in mind; we did so, our bids for funding were successful, and we managed to fund my scholarship.\n\nThanks to an old classmate of mine turned professor himself, <a href=\"http://merlin.fae.ua.es/giuba/\">Giovanni Ponti</a>, I found an University willing to take me on as a Ph.D. student without insisting in me doing yet another master in Economics (no more sitting in a classroom for me, thanks). Since Dragon Trainer requires doing a lot of network anaysis, Giovanni hooked me up with one of Europe's most prominent network scientists, <a href=\"http://www.eui.eu/Personal/fvega/\">Fernando Vega-Redondo</a>.\u00a0 I attended Fernando's Ph.D. course on complex social networks, and he amazed me by asking me to collaborate on yet another research project, that builds on a simple, but groundbreaking idea derived from my \"designing emergence\" framework!\n\nI am not an academic, and probably never will be. I started to follow that career path in the 90s, but then discarded it. But, along my journey, academia has been a very useful place for me to find space and help to think radically, beyond day-by-day work. The pattern has been to approach first-rate academics with specific and ambitious requests: I found out that they enjoy the intellectual kick they get from hanging out with people different from their own departmental tribes; and that they will help if they can.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-06 15:37:25", "updated_at": "2018-06-05 08:22:53.024054", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 916, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27662, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1467, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>A device to measure the degree of life energy in the body</b>\n\nAlberto, I agree with you that it is probably a lost cause... and alternative paths are the solution.\n\nHowever, Ginevra raises a very good point.

In total around 12 people turned up, some very familiar faces and others we met for the first time. Among the EdgeRyder ranks were @ArthurD and @hexayurt. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>I hadn\u2019t anticipated a format, since I thought it would be smaller but it was evident we needed it, especially after moving location 3 times trying to find a quiet enough spot to speak. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>So we began with a round circle of introductions, posing the questions; <strong>Who are you? What are you currently working on? and, What does Stewardship mean to you? </strong></span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>With a desire to keep this succinct, I\u2019m going to try to share only the key points and quotes that arose, but it was very rich discussion. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>***</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>In response to <strong>What does Stewardship mean to you?</strong>, some interesting ideas and responses emerged - both myself and Lauren have encountered a lot of ambivalence and confusion in asking individuals to respond to it, so this conversation was refreshing for it\u2019s engagement and effort towards a working definition.</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Mamading for me summarised this ambivalence succinctly when he said \u201cI don\u2019t ever think about Stewardship as a discrete concept in of itself, because it is too deeply ingrained in the philosophy of what I do\u201d. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Nick Stewart\u2019s comment followed this \u201cStewardship for me aims to work against the sense of just working for today\u201d. Which was backed by Muhammad Jaffer\u2019s desire to act as carrier of the learnings of what we develop around Stewardship to communities we he believes could benefit. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Further punctuated by a sense of urgency expressed by Pamela, a generational proclamation that \u201cYou are the last chance at doing this better\u201d, a comment worthy of the Anthropocene epoch we find ourselves in. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>This was followed by Sophia\u2019s introduction of her work in (\u201cminor\u201d) behavioural change, relating to Creative Labs - which located the work of Stewardship in the realm of mental health, as a taboo subject, but essential in working towards creating conditions for real support and mutual aid, the mind can be the only starting point for any real potential for deep change. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>As expected by those of us familiar with his work, @hexayurt bought the heavier, geopolitical dimension to the table for the Stewardship debate, firstly by describing necessity of Stewardship as the \u201cresponsibility of stewards to ensure something doesn\u2019t get fucked up by externalities, through the creation of defence models outside of what currently exists\u201d, those externalities being; Patent Systems, Capital and the failings of \u201cThe State apparatus of stewardship\u201d. \u00a0</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>General consensus of those attending seemed to amass to; the state isn\u2019t interested in investing into the capacity needed to make stewardship of assets possible. [Which might be something that <a href=\"/u/commonfutures\">@CommonFutures</a> </span></span><span>would contest, although the imagery of salmon swimming up stream does come to mind.] </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>If it were though, an interesting historical example was given of what a state engaged in skill sharing and co-working would look like. In Cuba upon the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Cuban army was instructed to disseminate knowledge and skills at speed, in the space of weeks they trained a large chunk of the population in skills needed to prevent the potential collapse of an economy without oil money.</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>*** </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Having not really structured an agenda for the meetup, after the round circle we decided to start from scratch by asking: What are the prime questions for routing into an understanding of Stewardship? </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Given the broad base, this resulted in a scattering of opinions, references and ideas. Which included; the assertion that any idea of stewardship should encompass a birds eye view of the biopolitical, an understanding of rare earths and other depleting resources, as a prerequisite of sound judgement. Reference to the \u2018Helsinki\u2019s Design Lab\u2019 paper on </span><a href=\"http://www.helsinkidesignlab.org/legiblepractises\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span>Legible Practices</span></a><span>. Examples of pre-existing concepts of Stewardship in recent work of the past decade, specifically \u2018Power to Change\u2019, Learning Journeys, Communities of Practice and Open Space Technology. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Which branched into an interesting discussion, about the nature of Networked Institutions, organisational forms based on living systems and a sobering account of examples that have failed. Reading back over my notes this part of the discussion seems to relate directly to the Track: Stewarding Communities. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Sophia led the discussion, in recounting her experience of working through the development of a community who aimed to practice a new culture (specifically) - a group who started with shared objectives and ended in a split. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Recounting various aspects of this experience, she summarised what provoked the community\u2019s breakdown:</span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Principally it was found that the sale of skills and the practice (provoked by the desire to be sustainable) to third parties, that had been developed within the community led to a poisoning of the well.</span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>It wasn\u2019t a simple antagonism that led to its collapse though, instead it was death through separation - as well as a loss of energy. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>With a particular unit of the community focusing on the commercial aspects of operation, many of the charismatic core stopped turning up to meetings that weren\u2019t relevant to commercial activity. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Increasing the skill base which had developed ceased due to slowed onboarding of new members and reduced sharing of skills. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>And this was it\u2019s death, through separation. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>In some ways I felt as though this experience was shared as a warning, relating directly to aspects of what it is we\u2019re trying to do and a past experience worth acknowledging and interrogating. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>The discussion opened out and some useful points were made: </span></span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Hierarchy may not explicitly exist, but hierarchy of experience is still hierarchy. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Competence can not be divorced from the notion of Stewardship </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Is it possible to coach tactical incompetence? </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Communities should strive towards \u2018semi-permeability\u2019 to ensure resilience over time. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t<span><span>Legible organisational structures = Mousetraps for competence. </span></span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span><span>Rounded off in discussion by the proclamation that any networked institution/community should be capable of losing it\u2019s founders in exchange for emerging competent individuals. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>\u201cIs the organisation capable of pushing out the early founders in exchange for more competent, usually younger individuals?\u201d </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>The suggested cure being to ensure continued modification of roles and positions are encoded into the organisational form from the start and at each point of it\u2019s evolution. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>*** </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Towards the end of the 2 hours we spent in open discussion at Royal Festival Hall, we found ourselves at a point where we could really get into the meat of the subject at hand. Through a comparison of what we\u2019d discussed that felt like Stewardship at a guttural level and that which certainly didn\u2019t, we took a stab at a working definition/framing, led by Mamading. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Stewardship manifests as the gardening of an ecology. In so much that it is not curation or archiving. Stewardship can only relate to that which is active - it acknowledges and works towards the preservation and growth of use value, exclusively. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>I hope that I\u2019ve conveyed that in a way that can be understood clearly, any refinement or active move to elucidate it further is appreciated. Rebuttals are also welcome. </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>In the closing of the meetup, this definition suggested to us a powerful tactic for advancing our understanding. The critical question being: </span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span><strong>\u201cHow do you identify long term existing examples of things in the wild that have stewardship implicitly embedded in them?\u201d </strong>\u00a0</span><br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<br class=\"kix-line-break\">\n\n<span>Now in order to grasp the core of this question think about gardening allotments and begin looking around you for the ancestors of Stewardship, because it\u2019s likely there is a deep gulf of understanding between us and them. </span></span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-11 08:44:25", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 12:33:36.411746", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2974, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4748, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 4715, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">\"Tbilisi is beautiful.\" says Tinatin Asatiani. \"But you can't see it. The billboards and banners ruin our city's outlook.\" And that is why she, and father and son Levan and Giorgi Kuchukhidze, decided on\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.projectcity.ge/indexeng.html\">ProjectCity</a>,\u00a0integrating architecture into the advertising business.\u00a0</h3>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/656939b24dead2b80c61d37c4b5291208b037764.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">The idea is simple. You take a projector, you find a nice wall, and during night times you project visuals on said wall.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">And not only that.\u00a0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">In a few months they hope to have apps on their website working which will enable you, the user, to make you own GIF advertisements. Hereby, making way for small business owners, non-profit organizations, and individuals, to cut the middle man out and advertise for low costs.\u00a0</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">I said down with Tinatin, one of the founders, on skype to talk about ProjectCity.</h3>\n\nMe and my friend Giorgi Kuchukhidze, he is an architect, we came up with it.\u00a0\n\nI always have a lot of ideas. And I always write them down. But we don't have the resources to do these projects.\u00a0\n\nGiorgi had the idea for a project, to advertise for someone via a projector. That is how it started. I was working on a project for a television station, so I told them about his idea. They told me that the idea was interesting, but that it was too expensive. We also went to a bank, and they also said it was too expensive for them.\u00a0\n\nSo we transformed the idea. Why go to one organization? Instead, perhaps it is smarter to organize it ourselves and get several different paying clients? We would decide on the locations, and the clients would just be buying time.\n\nThough, we realized it was an expensive idea. But not as expensive as video billboards are. And billboards make the city ugly, they are rough, they are not integrated into the architecture.\u00a0\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">After working for a year, writing the business and finding foreign investors, they are now settled in office in town. They have two working projectors, a third one coming up soon, and are planning to expand to other cities as well.</h3>\n\nBut it is not just Tinantin and Giorgi who are part of the team. They have two designers, Sandro (Tete) Chinchaladze and Gio Mikhiashvili. And Shotiko Shatberashvili is responsible for IT. \"For now we have few staff. But as you can see we don't have a sales department, marketing. Because we are trying to cut this part out of the equation\".\n\nTechnically almost everything is done. Our goal is now to fill all the time-slots, at night, with advertisements. We are shooting our own advertisement to put on TV, a tutorial. To inform people how they can use our website and apps and put the advertisement on the projectors. It should be very easy.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/754a7de9a8c936c86d6e9b7d20291a5f05d57476.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nYou know, when you go online and you order your own t-shirt? You can choose the color, design, graphics, text. We will offer this for advertisement, this idea.\u00a0However, we will check adveristements before we put them on, because we don't want people to write something vulgar. So we will need two days to review them. Right now we bought some videos from a hosting website and using them as background. We are making GIFS with them, making transitions.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/i5aUCnF0AlE\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">The one thing Tinatin really enjoys about her work is seeing the end result.\u00a0</h3>\n\nIt is impressive.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, Outdoor.ge has a monopoly on outdoor advertising. And Georgians are not very good in new things. When we meet with larger companies who are distributing products here, they don't want to change. They receive a large budget for outside advertising. They don't care. They don't care what it looks like. They spend the money, and that's it.\u00a0\n\nIt's hard to make companies understand that our project works esthetically much better.\n\nWe have to show them that it can be different. To change their mindset.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What they need besides money, is perhaps a better working municipality. As Tinatin explains me, the local government loves the idea, the ministry of culture loves the idea, but decisions take long times.</h3>\n\nIt was not very difficult to get permits from city hall. But right now we have some small problems with them. They are unable to make decisions, they say that they want to, but then they don't.\n\nWe are waiting forever to communicate with them.\n\nThey like the idea a lot, we had a meeting with the mayor's office. The ministry of culture as well. They all really like the idea. But when we need something, it takes a long time, too long, to make a decision. A lack of professionalism. Perhaps managerial problems.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">And what does ProjectCity have to offer others?</h3>\n\nWe want to promote visual art. So, what we are planning to do is have an online competition. We put the work of visual artists on our website, and people can go and choose an artwork. They pay for it to be played, to give it a time-slot. The price for this will be cheaper.\n\nOur staff, they make a lot of videos for our website.\n\nBut we want to involve visual artists, we want to give them an opportunity to have their work shown. We want to help visual art, support this field.\n\nIn general, we want people to see how the city influences them. How the city is disfigured because of the billboards and the advertisements. It seems like nobody cares, but no one actually likes it.\n\nGiorgi, as architect, he knows public space. My background, I have worked with and around the arts for a long time, as journalist.\n\nI want to say, the city looks really ugly, and I want to make it a better place.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fad867f39ff7ae36a29d993ff1968bcbdea59c6a.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nWe are not disfiguring anything. During the day time there is no projection, the city looks like it is, but at night you can see the advertisements projected on walls and buildings.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">As far as Tinatin knows, there aren't any similar initiatives locally or internationally.</h3>\n\nI searched and there are no similar initiatives anywhere, I couldn't find anything similar. As business project, that is. Because there are promotions of certain projects, for example Mitshubishi had a very good campaign, but they have a different approach.\n\nTbilisi is a city where the landscape is actually perfect for a project like this, you can project on many different surfaces. In cities with less interesting architecture, it will be a bit more difficult to do a project like this.\n\nOne of our investors is from Azerbaijan, the other is from the USA and one is from England.\n\nTbilisi is a good start for this project.

There are only two criteria:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Do I have the resources necessary actually produce an implementation, and</li>\n\n<li>Does the suggested feature empower end-users and vulnerable populations more than it empowers service providers or large institutions?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWith respect to number 1, if I do not have the resources (knowledge, time, money, shelter, mental well-being, etc.) necessary to actually produce an implementation then I create an enahncement/feature request ticket on the GitHub issue tracker. You can <a href=\"https://github.com/betterangels/buoy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement\">see all of these tickets (which effectively represent a to-do list) on GitHub here</a>. If, on the other hand, I do have the required resources to implement a given feature, then I apply the second criteria.\n\nWith respect to number 2, I make a personal judgement call about what I believe the impact of creating the feature will be. As part of this, I consider who is asking for the feature. If the feature is being suggested by a white man who works at a tech company and does not engage in much activist practice themselves, then I am bluntly far less likely to give that suggestion the benefit of the doubt. For example, almost all of the suggestions to \"integrate 911 and let people call the police\" have come from people matching this description. In contrast, when the suggestion comes from someone who I know as part of a local activist collective, as the example I gave in my previous reply about the Celly replacement, then I may not even bother to create a GitHub ticket because I simply immediately begin working on the feature.\n\nAnother part of this number 2 criteria relates to how the implementation actually works. For example, the SMS/txt broadcast channel uses IMAP behind the scenes specifically so that non-Google/non-Microsoft email services can be used. While I expect most people will still use a GMail account or similar to enable this feature for their own teams, it's important to me that features built into Buoy do not force end-users towards proprietary, and thus obviously predatory, services. In other words, feature suggestions that necessitate the use of proprietary/predatory services over the use of technologies that can be self-owned and self-operated are more likely to find themselves unimplemented, because I will reject them philosophically.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-17 00:02:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:08.454455", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 469, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [20730], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13711, "user_id": 3025, "topic_id": 5222, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Hack that pad ...</b>\n\nHello @Alberto and @Noemi\n\nI like the suggestion, since I guess you're suggesting it, because worked at previous LOTEs, so go ahead! Why change a running system. Just some comments &amp; questions:\n\n1. Sounds good, will you post every single link to the wiki then in advance, too (or is it one link for all sessions, referring to \\#3?)? Will there be a little time in the very beginning of the event when everyone is gathered so that you could walk people through a short introduction into Hackpad? I expect lots of people to join the documentation team kinda spontaneously on the spot, so they might appreciate a short \"how to\", if they never heard of Hackpad (the name alone can be a bit intimidating, as it *slightly* implies you gotta be techy). I'm thinking of the pen and paper crowd here and of how to best invite people in case this is a new form of doing things for them.\n\n2. Good idea for people who like the communal documenting idea. I'd like to add that people should still be encouraged to find a good balance between trying this if they like, but not feel pushed if they prefer to do it in another way. For me, it would be very distracting to listen to the session while co-documenting with others. I would easily get lost in trying to read other people's contributions - and have a lot of fun doing it - but get distracted. So yes, point to the Hackpad, and leave space for alternatives, so that people can do it the way they do it best.\n\nWho would do this \"pointing out\", then? Can the speakers be asked to refer to the Hackpad link / Documentation thread in the beginning? No one of us will be around at every session, so how can this work best for all?\n\nWould it help to have a \"how to document / Hackpad\" poster in the room as a backup plan, so people can look up the basics there? Like this, for example:\n\n- Like co-documenting with others? Go to: https://lote5.hackpad.com/ and find the session. Group Hackpad on!\n\n- Like to document individually? Enjoy. After you're done, please upload this here: \"link in forum to be defined where the postings about sessions will be set up\" and find the session you'd like to contribute your documentation to.\n\nOr so ...? Don't know. How did you do it in the past so that it was clear where the documentation goes to? Before every session? Once at the very beginning of the event?\n\n3. Would that mean that it's one large hackpack-document in the end? Would it then still be possible to link to individual parts of it, for example to add a link to the hackpad for session X to thread about session X?\n\nMore on general documentation/harvesting questions/coordination in next comment.\n\nCheers\n\nKaja\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-17 17:37:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:17.486242", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 520, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6693], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32564, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4918, "post_number": 29, "raw": "<b>Multiplicity in unity</b>\n\nI agree with most of what you are saying, Guy. It is very true that a EU project\u00a0is two things, and this not only for us but for everyone, at least in theory. It is its own thing: a project with a pulse, practices, a management structure, rules etc. It is also a stepping stone to wherever its partners want to go. There are some organizations that treat EU funded research as a market, and see themselves as active in this market. They do projects just to do projects. From what I hear, the Commission is not happy about this at all, because the lack of ambition of these organizations translates into a lack of impact of EU taxpayer money poured into research.\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, the EC is a rule-based organization. Therefore, we do need to tick all the boxes. This leads to running two projects at once: one is, as you say, institutional and funded, and it will end on December 31st 2017. The other one is\u00a0entrepreneurial and not funded, and it will live on or not. The two share some activities.\u00a0\n\nThe activities most central to the entrepreneurial side of the project should, wherever possible, overdeliver.\u00a0We committed to delivering 1,000 pieces of content (posts + comments) by the end of the year. We are already over 1,500 \u2013 no problem for the institutional project, the box is ticked. But for the entrepreneurial project, we would love to overshoot the goal: get to 3-4,000.\u00a0\n\nHow is this achieved? By mobilizing people. ER is committed to mobilizing its own community (broadly intended). We believe this is, for us, the best use of our limited communication resources. And it's working out, given that most of 113 people who have contributed content to OC so far come from that direction. But everyone else is more than welcome to go fish for people and content in other spaces. We appreciate they may require different communication styles \u2013 even different philosophies of engagement. @Costantino says \"user experience works\", and he is right. @Noemi says \"people are interested in people and their stories, not in websites\", and she, too, is right.\u00a0I have no problem with any of that \u2013 it probably means that Costa can reach out to a crowd that will react to Ux, and No to one that will react to stories. So, it makes sense that Costa is free to build a landing page he likes, and No to share links pointing directly to individual challenge responses. We will have more people, more diversity, better collective intelligence. Whatever works.\n\nThe style guide is impressive work. We are grateful for it,\u00a0and we will use it. But we will only use it when the benefits of doing so exceed the costs.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-19 11:07:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:58.823216", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 493, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32531], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4732, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 4699, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">If you ask anyone where you can see live bands in Tbilisi, they will all direct you to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rifferbar\">Riffer bar</a>.

And the idea all happened one drunken night.</h3>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">I set down with Giorgi Marr, one of its founders.</h3>\n\nSo we are four guys who started Riffer: Nika Kocharov (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eyCSH47PQ\">Young Georgian Lolitaz</a>), Sandro Salukveridze (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gO9-fV9SbA4\">Lady Heroine</a>), my brother Vazhiko (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lShAMkTrmdY\">Me And My Monkey</a>), and me (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnIIzUTCoG8\">The Black Marrows</a>). We are musicians.\n\nAnd one day we were sitting and talking about where you can play. And we just heard the news that <a href=\"http://divan.ge/\">Divan</a>, the club, was shut down.\n\nIt was sad, because we had no idea where to play now. Because, you know, there are only two or three places you can perform as a band.\n\nNika said he has this place, a basement, which belongs to his father, like a cellar, and maybe we could ask him and use it and do something there. It was just a drunk conversation.\n\nBut the next day we were like, it's actually a really good idea, maybe we should start it? And so we discovered that this place is still there and it belongs to Nika's father. And he said you can have it, and do with it whatever you want. We were quite lucky.\n\nSo we started to build the place up. Clean it, and do everything.\n\nThe main idea was to make a place where young bands could practice playing in front of a crowd. Where they could play. Just a place where you can gather and talk about music.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7465951be7a4afd77f8f15f1a738be9b57d25d62.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"250\"><br>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">So why is it different?</h3>\n\nIn Georgia you always have places, you don't have concept bars, everything is always mixed somehow. So we decided to have a place where you only have rock, a more narrow way, such as the 90ies stuff. More alternative music, grunge, etc.\n\nIn the beginning we were a bit afraid, because in Tbilisi there are not a lot of people and if you specialize: will enough people come? But it actually turned out quite well.\n\nAt the start only our friends knew about the place, only they came. But after two months we decided to do alternative karaoke, hosted by a famous singers, or a guy from a band, and people really enjoyed that, it became really crowded.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Although Riffer started with the idea in mind that it should be a platform for young and new musicians, unfortunately they had to narrow it down.</h3>\n\nWe try to have nice bands. When you have bands that don't know what to do, they don't use the equipment well. The first year we let everyone play, but it was a disaster. We had to fix or replace equipment twice a week. So we changed it, and now we only have bands who already have some experience. I don't mean that we don't let anyone play, but we became a little bit more strict on who we accepted.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What about the team, who's involved? What are the roles and responsibilities?</h3>\n\nSo, we are four of us: me, Vazhiko my brother, Nika Kocharov, and Sandro. So, Sandro is more responsible for financial and equipment stuff. Nika is the main owner, because the place belongs to him. When we decide something, he is the boss. And my brother is the one booking the bands and responding on facebook to people who write to us. And I am doing design stuff, inside the club, but also posters, invites, anything visual.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Any partnerships?</h3>\n\nLast year we took our bar to <a href=\"http://www.tbilisiopenair.ge/en#lineup\">Tbilisi Open Air</a> festival, that was kind of a collaboration, we had a small stage.\n\nTbilisi Open Air is the biggest open air festival in Georgia. A lot of international bands are coming. This year it's really huge because Placebo is performing. And the festival is going to be five days, the ine-up is really nice. Already five or six years it exists.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/52e768e0d061dd17953b026f60a5ee19994d2e3a.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nLast year we had the chance to bring our choice of bands. We had small stage and bar and it looked like our bar. We had acoustic bands playing during the day and we did Karaoke as well at night. This year we are not sure yet if we will be there.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Riffer does not have a long term perspective, but they would like to expand. However, you always encounter problems.</h3>\n\nRiffer is quite small, but I would love it to be my main job. We still have to do things next to it to live. It would be nice to extend, to have another Riffer in another district, so we can live of it. Because it is really popular and crowded, so crowded that I don't even want to go anymore because it is too crowded.\n\nThe problem is that when it is going well, like now, we sometimes just stay at home and think everything will be alright. We get lazy. But as soon as you are there, it will go better.\n\nBut we are learning from this, we don't have any experience like this, we are musicians. But we hope that this can be sustainable business for us.\n\nThe problem is that you still need money to get what you want. So we have plans to renovate small things in September. There are somethings we want to change, for example air conditioning. We want to change the equipment, and yeah, I don't know. I don't really know what our longterm plan is. We have the option to get some sponsors to do some small renovations,.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">What does Giorgi enjoy most about his work at Riffer? The one thing he is responsible for: the visuals.</h3>\n\nI enjoy most doing things inside the place, like painting and reconstructing. Like, everything is handmade here, the bar, the stage, all the style things that you have. I like the design, it could be better, but what we had financially, we made it, and I like making it.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/df595ee62900f7413775aa3e6ce7b422d891f063.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"255\"><br>\n\nIf you remember the tiles on the background of the stage? We put stickers there, and I change these every month. And at the entrance we have stencils. And now we decided to have a new stencil on the wall every year.\n\nI also really enjoy doing the posters, because you always have new bands playing here, new things are happening, so all the time I am at home.\n\nBut I don't like talking money, the bureaucratic stuff. And talking to the manager and the bartenders. If you don't pay attention to them, they may do something wrong. You always have to be in control and it's quite difficult.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">The schedule, according to Giorgi, is quite chaotic now and then. But while he explains the tasks they do you do on a regular basis, it becomes clear they do have some structure.</h3>\n\nEvery week we have to book someone for Friday night. And so, my brother is booking, then Sandro is talking to them for what they need, so he can prepare, meanwhile I am preparing a poster and Nika is preparing the bar itself: how many people should fit and what should be done.\n\nWe do the same for Karaoke night. We have three nights a week Karaoke, and we usually know two weeks ahead who will host the night. We have a schedule for that. And I have my designing things for that ready, just need to change somethings, but every day I do work on it.\n\nLately we also have had jam session nights, where the musician comes with their equipment, and then people can join and play together whatever they want. It worked quite well.\n\nBut we don't plan 3 months ahead, it's Georgia, it is impossible.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Although Giorgi mentioned money is always an important factor, when I asked what support they could use besides money, it was clear that someone with the right kind of knowledge would be very appreciated.</h3>\n\nIt would be really nice if we could have a person who is experienced in this, because we are new to this and it takes a long time to learn. So someone who can give us advice.\n\nNobody works with us for 1000GEL if they are very experienced, so it's really hard to find a manager who is experienced, but also very dedicated. You always get someone who is interested in the beginning, but then they get tired of it.\n\nAnother thing we would like is a new location, it would be great to have two locations. In other countries this also happens, and it's always nice.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">And what does Riffer offer?</h3>\n\nWhen the bands come, they have a gig, we sell tickets. And the tickets go 50/50. In most places you go and no-one gives you anything,. You spend more money than you get out of it. But in Riffer you play, get free drinks and you get ticket money.\n\nOther places, in Georgia: there used to be Divan, which was quite good. Then there is Magti club, but I don't really like it. I know they have good equipment, but it's not a nice place to sit and have a drink. I heard something about raven bar, where bands can also play, but I've never been there.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">For future plans they are thinking of taking Riffer to the seaside for summer.</h3>\n\nWe really wanted to do something in Batumi (seaside town), because in summer there is absolutely no-one in Tbilisi. So we wanted to take riffer to the sea. But somehow we could not manage it for this year, it is quite expensive, so maybe next year we can try.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">And a fun fact on a last note:</h3>\n\nThe four of us, we are all musicians, and we started an all-star band called Riffer. We started a promo band, and we became quite famous for a while. We had two videos and won an award at the caucasian rock awards. It was quite fun, you can imagine. And it also helped with the popularity of our bar.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/oNT5yzSd5QM\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-24 23:44:52", "updated_at": "2019-01-15 20:31:24.194865", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2025, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 60.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25501, "user_id": 1890, "topic_id": 2679, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Thanks Matthias!\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-07 15:53:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.860213", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25327], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2424, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2391, "post_number": 1, "raw": "If you remember last year\u2019s exercise of building Edgeryders shared vision, one of the recurrent ideas was to leverage the establishment for our own projects.

Building an alternative, inclusive \"social security system\", ending the dichotomy \"Employed/unEmployed\" in the long term.\n\n**Hypothesis:** Reframing and changing the cultural and institutional mindset is possible.\n\n**Testing it involves:**\n\n* build the system around (existing) alternative currencies as safety nets: purpose bound, unlocking potential, transnational\n\n* start small and scale up when possible\n\n* reframe completely what we consider exclusion and measure the gains of a changed mindset in non-financial ways\n\n* an open platform to collect labour experiences: \u201cThe Academy of the excluded\u201d?\n\n* redefine ways and conditions to understand work: precarious or permanent, employed or unemployed, business or voluntary\n\n* ensure diverse participation of informal networked groups\n\n* learn from groups already doing that; e.g. research [digitallabor.org](http://digitallabor.org/)\n\n* who's already interested: @thomasviscom, @thanasis\n \n\n## 4. Build community cooperative networks\n\n**Hypothesis:** Higher social impact can be achieved by connecting potential coming from Ireland, the living lab direction (unMonastery) and from social cooperative development of key models such as CSA and cooperative property guardian co-ops.\n\n**Testing it involves:**\n\n* using a rhizomatic model being prototyped in Ireland: community exchange based on sale and supply of the local food system, generating cooperative enterprise models\n\n* OS alternatives to proprietary software we currently employ\n\n* finding partners in key participant countries\n\n* research into building multi-stakeholder cooperatives\n\n* who's already interested: @eimhin\n\n* deadline for signing up to submit to the Horizon 2020 call: [TODO]\n\n\n## 5. Take up of ethic, social and environmental responsibility in ICT business\n\n**Hypothesis:** Higher impact of the ICT business if societal issues are seen as opportunities not as threats.\n\n**Testing it involves:**\n\n* label mechanisms to identify responsible ICT businesses\n\n* a focused consortium bringing together researchers from both ethics &amp; ICT field, SMEs that want to differentiate by an ethic positioning, consumer associations and citizen communities.\n\n* adoption of the label by SMEs and recognition by a broad community\n\n* from team: professionalism and strong reactivity in the proposal writing phase\n\n* who's already interested: @bcpx\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The list is of course open, but gives us enough to work with in order to move on to identifying which calls are suited (list available <a href=\"https://www.euresearch.ch/en/european-programmes/call-for-proposals/open-calls/\">here</a>) and locating resources</strong>: building Gantt charts and timelines, and strategizing for partnership building. So I guess what is needed now is either another hangout to follow up properly on this conversation, or an actionable like [noelito] just <a href=\"/t/summary-of-the-first-horizon-2020-hangout-please-answer-the-questions/2363/13\">suggested</a>: <strong>#formstorm</strong> to map research institutions or partners altogether, looking at those who would be compatible with the specific topics above. How about that?\n\nAnother thing which rose from our conversation, especially with [Caroline Paulic...], is that we\u2019re keen on working in smaller teams driven by a common interest, so one of the next steps should be grouping ourselves around some of the above. As @ilariadauria pointed out a while ago, one can only have resources to deploy around their own interest and background. Chances are you know who is already doing stuff and maybe even have some contacts to build partnerships around it.\n\nFinally, back in December when about 40 Edgeryders helped shape <a href=\"/t/sharing-visions-of-edgeryders-the-first-community-survey-responses/2278\">our vision</a>, a dozen of us have made ourselves available to get involved in helping with collaborative EU funding applications. <span>[pacheca], [aden], [Jeff Mowatt], [Ursula], [L14B] does it still hold true? if yes, is there something above which interests you? how do you see yourself helping and do you have any suggestions at this point? Do mention if you are a researcher, an administrator, if you\u2019d like to join as an individual, as a company etc.</span>\n\nLet\u2019s do this :)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_P.S.: If you wish to participate in building a joint Horison 2020 application for any one of these options, leave a comment below indicating which one you are interested in. **Deadline: February 20.**_", "created_at": "2014-02-04 14:25:41", "updated_at": "2019-06-22 16:11:34.691946", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1023, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 26.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25592, "user_id": 2407, "topic_id": 4158, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Yes and No (but OT) :-)</b>\n\nYes :\n\nI agree that :\n\n\"Austerity policy are sold politically as a necessary waypoint towards more, and more sustainable, growth in the long run \u2013 a bit like a medical treatment, painful in the short run but the obvious thing to do.\"\n\n\"In Europe, it seems to me, this discourse takes on a more moralistic spin than usual.\n\n...\n\nWhen they insist other European countries bite the austeritarian bullet, they point to their own efforts to raise labor productivity in the 1990s. \"It worked for us.

In short : there are arguments for austerity 'in the long run', but austerity during a depression aggravates the depression. You must first, short term, get out of the depression, before tackling the long term problems. This is standard keynesian macroeconomics, has been told beforehand and been confirmed in practice.\n\nI think it is important, for the general purpose of understanding in which world we live, to understand why after 4 years of pursuing a policy that results, mostly, in the opposite of what it claims as its goal, that policy is not (officially) questioned.\n\nI am open to counterarguments.

Keep your eyes on the ball: if your goal is cheap insulin, or shoes that reap the health benefits of barefoot walking, you win even if it is Novartis or Nike delivering it. In open source, most people consider that open source is winning exactly because business uses it (and, now, contributes to maintaining it).

You can still go ahead and undercut them.</li>\n\n<li>That said, you can take a \"free\" as opposed to \"open\" approach, and use nc or nc-sa licenses. This means people can reuse your data, but are prohibited from doing anything commercial with it; additionally, with sa (share alike) any new entity that incorporates your data inherits their license, so all \"children\" dataset stay noncommercial forever. The Creative Commons website has a handy <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/choose/\">wizard</a> for choosing your preferrred license.\u00a0These days, noncommercial licenses are\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0considered open licenses according to the Open Definition. With Creative Commons licenses, additional usage rights can always be negotiated with the rights holder. So, you can put out data with a nc license; if Novartis thinks they are so valuable and want to use them to develop a drug, they have to come to you and ask for a different license. At that point you decide what to do. Of course, it is difficult to monitor that they do not just syphon the data up and do whatever they want anyway, but hopefully the regulation is tight enough that they will consider not worth the risk of being caught out.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nI'd love to help with your data strategy.

I do that (and have the time to do that) largely because I didn't build a nuclear family - no kids hauling on my arm when I'm trying to nerd something. I didn't choose to do this <em>instead</em> but it's something that was available to me because I didn't have kids.\n\nThe vast majority of that captital is <em>rightly</em> invisible. It's the ability to mail any one of two dozen people and get \u00a3500 or \u00a35000 worth of specialized professional advice because we have history, and because over time they've started to understand the difference between a scene where I'm present, and one where I am absent. A very substantial chunk of ER's culture, and most of the core team, come from the work I did as an engagement manager on the first ER project. Because I'd filled my life with people who get things done and have the potential to do more, when that network integrated into ER it became a very substantial part of the infrastructure of the project.\n\nBut the nature of this kind of work is to be kind of thankless and invisible, because <em>the reward is the caliber of people you get to spend your time with.</em>\n\nIt cannot be monetized, lionized or rewarded because then the field becomes contaminated with people who are doing it for the money or the power - <em>political actors</em> - rather than the genuine conviviality which Ivan Illich is such a fan of. It has to be done for the love of it, and the love of it has to be its own reward.\n\nI have taken money for running networks three times, for Hub Westminster, Limewharf, and EdgeRyders. In each case, it bought me a slab of time to spend with my friends, and a chance to make enough noise to meet some new friends - I owe Limewharf a permanent debt of gratitude for being the venue where Leo D. showed up, for example - we've all greatly benefitted from that, but me most of all because I made a new friend.\n\nBut the price of running as a largely demonetized actor is that, while you have the integrity to act, you don't have much money. If we were a real wealth-and-power network, we'd never know if the people trying to get close to us wanted to be our friends, or wanted to be in the loop of people we faciliate access to money for. We'd treat each-other as people treat each-other in Hollywood, or in finance. Now I am not against money, indeed I'm a little fonder of the stuff than I probably should be, even if I'm not willing to compromise for access to it. But I do think a lot of the equality and integrity of the EdgeRyders space comes from our relatively limited access to funds: you can do this work because you love it, but (so far) it's not easy to maintain a middle class standard of living doing it. <strong>Everybody involved is either too poor or too busy, and mostly both.</strong>\n\nThe conclusion I draw from that is this: <em>EdgeRyders as a company is really hard work.</em> EdgeRyders as a community is a lot easier, but then we all have to go and get day jobs, rather than getting posted to exotic locations to help out the UN :-)\n\nThe strength of EdgeRyders.com (vs. EdgeRyders.org) has always been that EdgeRyders.org motivates people to get involved, to resolve their differences constructively, to cooperate rather than defect in the long-iterated version of prisoner's dilemma which is so often a part of life in business. Because of the community feeling (which there are much better words for in Dutch, German and Swedish than English!) we're incentivised to keep everybody in the boat, even when we feel like throwing them overboard.\n\nBusiness and business decision-making eats social capital, the fabric of community, like a harsh abrasive. That's why we need to pay people so much to work in areas like finance, or Hollywood - those lives are lives dominated by distrust, power-gaming and unfair rewards for throwing your compatriots under a bus. For this reason, and amid all the pressure we have to make Matera an event which helps to ensure that ER has the ability to pay people to keep the show going, I want us to remember that the only real asset <strong>WE</strong> have is the community, our social fabric. There is no money to speak of - there's just enough potential to make it seem like careers and world changing projects might start here. But there is a very real and special thing, and we need to be aware of it - only celebration really gets to the heart of what makes this space of ours special.\n\nIf success finds us, we must not become TED. We must not become like the Theatre, with its star system. Some will be famous, some may be rich, but if we lose what we have in the process, we'll all be so much poorer. And there's the paradox: to be paid for social captial creation changes our motivations in ways which tend to kill real, authentic social capital.\n\nI think we can find a way through this, but it's next year's task, the thing to work on after Matera, when we know roughly where the big moves are. Does that make sense?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-30 11:41:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:58.132415", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1037, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32395], "is_liked_by": [8, 1450, 5, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20537, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3658, "post_number": 4, "raw": "I think I wouldn't mind doing it, but if you want it, sure.

Allergies, autism, stress, and different health and well-being related issues were among the topics that students listed as topic to tackle through OpenCare solutions that they will implement during the workshop. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis is an interesting opportunity to see how students will combine their freshly learned tech skills with the concepts of care that they target. \u00a0We are currently in our second week of the workshop, and it is intended to leverage the student's tech skills, and better form stories around products that they intend to develop. \u00a0\u00a0 Stay tuned to more updates by the end of the week.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/54788b5c62f92cb0cd6b3c0d6174bbb0f2abc78d.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/044b3d4e80a4116f9e6df41ab5fe16d6376b4708.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"390\">\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-29 09:08:20", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 13:52:06.030780", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 313, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3069, 3074, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27968, "user_id": 125, "topic_id": 1635, "post_number": 7, "raw": "many thanks for such a pleasant and considerate reading, Ben.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-24 20:14:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:34.266063", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16377, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4684, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>The collective action problem</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/saksham_suvedi\">@Saksham_Suvedi</a>, I think you clearly identified one of the biggest development challenges in Nepal. I've seen it \"live\" for a bit in a village in Dhading we visited shortly after the earthquake to bring some relief goods. The village had women, old men and children, but very few to none working-age men. Ten days after the quake, they had not even started clearing the debris or to rebuild anything. And how could they?\n\nHowever, I think it's also very much understandable what drives people abroad. Because on an individual level, it makes total sense: everyone else is leaving, and the work of building a better Nepal is way too much for those still in the country (or the young becoming adults now). So they try to leave as well, as all the better options are abroad then. However <em>if</em> everyone else would suddenly decide to stay and work for building a better Nepal, those tempted to leave would also stay. Because suddenly, it becomes realistic that the work can be done.\n\nThis is an example of what I'd call the <em>collective action problem</em>: it's where an individual's reasonable decision depends on what the group is doing. Since the group is harder to influence than the individual, individuals will follow the group and not vice versa.\n\nWhat you get is typical herd behaviour, which is very hard to change. Emphasizing values and appealing to peoples' morals (as in the article above) can support a change once it happens, but not cause it (imho). In the case of Nepal, because it's <em>so much more reasonable</em> to go than to stay \u2026 for each individual.\n\nHowever what <em>could</em> help is collective decision making at the smallest scale that pays off for participants. It's a bit similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding\">crowdfunding</a> and its funding thresholds. People would make conditional promises like \"I will stay (or come back) for at least 3 years if 300 other people from my village also stay for as long.\" Then, once the campaign collected enough support for the condition to come true, everyone has to keep the promise. And it makes sense for everyone to keep it, because with some hundred people working together, a village can for sure fix its infrastructure, develop its \"business plan\" etc..\n\nThe best (and only \u2026 duh) real-world example for this that I know is <a href=\"https://freestateproject.org/\">Free State Project</a>. I don't share their ideology, but the way they organize is inspiring. They are now close to their target of 20,000 people promising to move across the U.S. to the \"most free state\".\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-22 11:14:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:31.807554", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 482, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22282, "user_id": 1680, "topic_id": 2243, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>intentional communities</b>\n\nYep. Same wavelength.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd I think (I hope) we are going to see an explosion of this type of thing in the near future. Once the first groups start to show that it is really feasible, and document the process, more and more people will get the inspiration and nerve to try it. Looking back, people will wonder why the revolution didn't happen sooner. 'It was so simple. We just got together and lived the way we wanted to live'.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut why now? Haven't people always had this dream? Of course it's not a new idea; there have been hippie communes, kibbutzism, squatted social centres, etc. So why now? Why no explosion before? I guess it's some magical point where all the right things have come of age: The internet, social media, hackspaces/maker culture, 3D printers,\u00a0 DIY bio, hydro/aquaponics, bitcoins... etc\n\n\u00a0\n\nunMonastery has a lot in common with our thinking.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs I see it, the differences are:\n\n1) We want the long term future to be secure from the start. Borrowing a space for a year is really cool, but I'd be even happier if we owned the land. (And I'm confident that we can find the money to do this). In any scenario where we don't own the land/space, I'd want a solid plan for keeping the community together if we had to give up the land/space. I'd hope that the core of the community would intend to stay together long-term. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI wouldn't say I was closed to the idea of 'working with the establishment', just wary. I see anything that takes power from 'our' hands as a risk.\n\n\u00a0\n\n2) I wouldn't put so much emphasise on helping the local community. The goal is \u201cmake the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological damage or disadvantage to anyone\u201d. (which may involve helping/interacting with the locals or it may not).\n\n\u00a0\n\nPersonally I think our best shot at this is to begin by making/acquiring a lot of money by using our brainpower. If we do not become the next google/facebook/microsoft, I'll think we have failed. (I mean become that big/successful. I don't mean we want to copy anything else about them). (Others I've been talking to say we can change the world without money, but I struggle to imagine a situation where you offer an altruist 4 billion BTC and they don't bite your hand off saying 'yes! I could do a lot of good with that!' and instead say 'nah, we don't really need it, we can do everything with the power of love' or whatever). However, if we fail to make this amount of money, I won't give up hope, and I'll try the other ways, but I don't want to fail. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n3) Higher priority on farming / sustainability / self sufficiency.\n\n\u00a0\n\nProbably similar to http://sharewiki.org/en/Antwerp_Collective (we're already talking with Dante).\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnyone else we should be talking to? I'd also stress that all the things I've written are general feelings. I'm very open to people trying to change my mind about anything. (And if I find myself traveling; I'd love to visit Matera. But for the meantime, unfortunately we will have to make do with the internet :-/\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-03 15:01:56", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:04.101317", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 613, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21176], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26078, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 2522, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>The best community managers in Netezenland</b>\n\nThis is a very, very cool and generous idea on your behalf!\u00a0\n\nWe, as edgeryders, are so very lucky to have you guys propose this: I guess we couldn't ask for more: a tailored, human welcome as a walk around the platform.

Gilda a con\u00e7u ce projet avec l'aide d'un des meilleurs experts en collaboration ouverte, <a href=\"http://it.linkedin.com/in/albertocottica\">Alberto Cottica</a>, et s'est battue pour qu'il soit financ\u00e9 et pilot\u00e9 par le Conseil de l'Europe, conjointement avec la Commission europ\u00e9enne. Gilda continue de se battre pour faire rayonner son projet, et pour qu'il soit accept\u00e9 comme prototype mod\u00e8le. \u00c0 la mi-mars, le projet a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lors d'une table-ronde regroupant des participants Edgeryders et des gestionnaires du Conseil de l'Europe. La vision de Gilda Farrell et d'Alberto Cottica, d'une gouvernance ax\u00e9e sur la participation citoyenne, est en train de se concr\u00e9tiser. Tel un caillou que l'on fait ricocher contre la surface de l'eau, nous verrons bient\u00f4t les ondes de cette exp\u00e9rimentation se r\u00e9percuter infiniment au sein du Conseil de l'Europe et ses \u00c9tats membres, et m\u00eame au-del\u00e0 des fronti\u00e8res europ\u00e9ennes.\n\nJour apr\u00e8s jour, Gilda pose des gestes, ajoute une nouvelle brique \u00e0 la construction de sa vision. Elle s'est donn\u00e9 pour mission de transmuer la perception n\u00e9gative que les gouvernements et les entreprises se font des jeunes. En permettant aux jeunes de collaborer avec le Conseil de l'Europe, en leur offrant un espace non contr\u00f4l\u00e9 et par cons\u00e9quent, la libert\u00e9 de s'exprimer, Gilda fait en sorte que soit r\u00e9colt\u00e9e l'\u00e9vidence, ou une partie de la preuve justificative, que les jeunes ne sont pas du tout \u00e0 l'image de ce que certains indicatifs traditionnels nous indiquent (comme le NEET).\n\nPour se distancer encore davantage de ces indicatifs, elle a propos\u00e9 le 15 mars 2012, de se d\u00e9partir de l'acronyme NEET, qui porte une lourde connotation n\u00e9gative, et de le remplacer par SOFIR, \"<em>solution finders in search of recognition</em>\". Cela lui permettra d'ouvrir un nouvel espace, dans lequel pourraient \u00eatre introduites des solutions alternatives.\n\nPar cons\u00e9quent, Gilda insuffle son intention de transmuer la perception d'une proportion de la population en nous proposant de d\u00e9laisser les id\u00e9es obsol\u00e8tes, en introduisant dans l'espace cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la nouveaut\u00e9, la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et l'innovation, la possibilit\u00e9 que ce regard nouveau donne lieu \u00e0 une nouvelle fa\u00e7on de composer avec ces probl\u00e9matiques et favorise le d\u00e9veloppement de solutions appropri\u00e9es. Ceci devient possible parce qu'elle a fait le choix de laisser de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le mod\u00e8le d\u00e9suet. Mais cela ne signifie pas qu'il faille ignorer pour autant les statistiques et les analyses pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes.\n\nL'enjeu et les d\u00e9fis sont titanesques, mais Gilda sait o\u00f9 elle s'en va. Elle mettre en place le contexte qui permettra un changement profond et durable.\n\nElle s'appuie sur la force transformatrice du regard neuf.\n\nSa force r\u00e9side \u00e9galement dans une ma\u00eetrise de l'art du compromis.\n\nPuisqu'elle est capable d'apercevoir que la perception des jeunes est fauss\u00e9e, elle arrive \u00e9galement \u00e0 apercevoir que la perception qu'ont les citoyens des \u00e9lus, d\u00e9cideurs et gestionnaires gouvernementaux pourrait elle aussi d'av\u00e9rer erron\u00e9e. Gilda nous aide \u00e0 balayer nos pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s, et nous secoue, en esp\u00e9rant que sera compris le potentiel de chacun. Elle nous invite \u00e0 nous d\u00e9partir de nos vieilles lunettes pour contempler les gens sous leur v\u00e9ritable jour, de part et d'autre de la m\u00e9daille.\n\nAinsi, tous les d\u00e9cideurs gouvernementaux ne sont pas peut-\u00eatre aussi mesquins et mal intentionn\u00e9s que nous pourrions l'imaginer.\n\nGilda nous rappelle qu'il faut verser de l'eau dans son vin et donner chance au coureur. Sans doute qu'une majorit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cideurs ne parvient pas encore \u00e0 embrasser le changement. Mais il y en a qui s'efforcent de le faire, souligne-t-elle.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-24 19:06:18", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 04:40:03.079672", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 861, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28084, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2859, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>I LOOOOOVE IT!</b>\n\nCan I haz urls to user profiles on the nodes in the page here on Edgeryders pleez?

This means that we enable our community to develop solutions rooted in people's everyday realities, needs, and lifestyles.\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">VALUES</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Try to support and build on what is already there.\u00a0</strong><em>We start by sharing experiences and research.<strong>\u00a0</strong>We do this to discover what is already out there, what is needed by initiatives and the communities they serve.

Read, comment and post responses to challenges:<em>\u00a0</em></strong><em>We\u00a0</em><em>share stories of individuals and groups who are building alternative alternatives to existing health- or social care, as well as of others whose attempts were frustrated. The purpose of this is to build a shared repository of stories, each one embedding strategies for improving health- and social care. Some will resonate more than others with participants, and that will signal to the community that a grain of truth has been found. Collectively, we will build knowledge about new approaches towards health- and social care. </em><strong><a href=\"/en/op3ncare-community/helping-one-another-to-discover-what-is-already-out\">ONGOING: PARTICIPATE HERE!</a></strong>\n\n<strong>2. Make sense and build new knowledge:\u00a0</strong><em>Whether it is because you want to solve local problems, keep governments accountable, avoid expensive mistakes or learn new things about the world in which you live, \u00a0knowledge is power.\u00a0This phase links OpenCare stories to the social, economic, political and legal context in which they happen: were they enabled by something in particular? Were they hindered by it? What change in could have made the alternative happen, or happen more successfully? By asking and tentatively answering these kinds of question, participants in the process will build shared knowledge and goals.</em><strong><em>\u00a0</em><a href=\"/t/how-do-we-interpret-the-degree-of-interest-graphs/6136\">ONGOING: PARTICIPATE HERE!</a></strong>\n\n<strong>3.

Update: I (Alberto) am deleting the Guardian's questions and reference links. They can be found in the revision history.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe unMonastery draws inspiration from 6th century\u2019s monastic life to encourage radical forms of collaboration and innovation: a sort of lay, off-grid mendicant order striving for a society that can better withstand present and future systemic crises. The social phenomena behind this project are the rise of hacker culture and the deepening of the crisis in Europe. Taken together, these two trends mean more and more educated, connected and generous young people. Of these, many aspire to a deep societal fix, and do not think they can bring it about by joining the public service, nor by working for the private sector. They don\u2019t buy into the \u201cgonna change the world\u201d Silicon Valley rhetoric; for them, innovating means tackling the fundamental problems of expanding individual freedom, establishing a fair social deal, crafting an environmentally sustainable society \u2013 not inventing gadgets. Their walks of life seem unsettling, even dangerous to most of us: they are no strangers to nomadic lifestyles, squatting, cryptocurrencies, hardware hacking. They are technologically savvy, idealistic and almost always poor. The unMonastery offers them a deal similar of that of the monasteries of old: lodging, board and time to think and realize their ideas, relatively free from the need to make money.\n\nJust like the early monasteries, the unMonastery does not seek economic sustainability through business planning: rather, it tries to be as self-sufficient as possible (for example through urban farming practices) and to embed itself in a local community with which to trade in kind rather than in money. This move allows unMonasterians to sidestep the unemployment problem completely: a happy, meaningful life is about making something that others will find useful, rather than one in which someone buys your time against money. At the same time, it encourages unMonasteries not to depend too much on the money economy \u2013 which is a good thing, since you cannot trust it to stay up in a systemic crisis.\n\nA first breakthrough was simply finding each other. A year ago 27-year old Londoner Ben Vickers connected with an Europe-wide online community called Edgeryders, and through it to kindred spirits in Sweden, Italy, Norway, France and elsewhere. This created a first core of founding unMonasterians that could develop the project. The second breakthrough happened when Edgeryders developed a partnership with the Italian city of Matera, that agreed to host an unMonastery prototype as part of its own future building strategy. Matera added to the mix a very interesting unused building\u00a0 and, even more importantly, an interface to a local community that wants to evolve and has some meaty problems to deal with.\n\nThere is much talk about smart cities, but many local communities are left on the sidelines if they cannot pay for expensive (usually proprietary) technologies. The unMonastery provides an alternative path: put the smarts in people rather than in artifacts, and use networks of individuals (mediated locally by the physical unMonastery building, and globally by the unMonastic \u201corder\u201d) to store and grow such knowledge. Imagine having a place where you can ask for help in developing social innovation initiatives in your local communities. It would help young people by providing them with opportunities for creative engagement in their communities, particularly in areas of deprivation. Also, it would enable local people to use their understanding of their communities to improve both their own skills and their place.\n\nunMonastery Matera is accepting applications for residencies: https://edgeryders.eu/blog/unmonastery-matera-now-accepting-application-for-residencies.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-23 13:33:58", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 04:25:06.036277", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 669, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18004, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1620, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Twitterlike consumer coop sounds cool</b>\n\nIm wonering why everyone is on twitter then, not on http://identi.ca/ for example which is open source.\n\nBetter marketing?

Makes sense: in a time of crisis, the ways young people transition over to adulthood have changed, and that might call for new policies. The expectations were not too high: split up the transition topic into issues (employment, education, family etc.), assign each one to a credentialed expert and task her with writing an essay, stitch the essays together into a report. Your taxpayer euro at work.\n\nExcept that, right from the onset, our group at the Council of Europe decided to do it differently. <strong>We recast citizens, regardless of age or credentials, as experts</strong>; asked them to share their life experiences and wisdom on an open source online platform; and refused to treat them as \"targets\" or \"respondents\". Instead, we considered anyone who chose to engage as a co-researcher. We bestowed upon\u00a0them the title of Edgeryders, in recognition of the difficult work done by those who explore the edges of a deep economic and societal crisis.\n\nThe result surpassed all \u00a0our expectations. An incredibly diverse community of changemakers rose to the challenge: we realized that a vast, distributed operation of sensemaking, research and development was (is) underway. People were trying all sorts of cutting-edge innovation <em>on themselves</em>: open source software, eco-friendly communities, non-transactional economies, protest movements, urban agriculture, nomadic lifestyles, mutual emotional support in the face of a tough environment, sharing economies, you name it. <strong>Some of the smartest, most generous people I have ever met showed up, apparently out of nowhere. Most of them are not wealthy; some are struggling. Everyone found the time to compare notes, share, and help.</strong> We were humbled by such an open, generous attitude.\u00a0<span>Less than a year later, we had one thousand users from over twenty\u00a0countries;\u00a0five hundred blog posts; four thousands comments; and a 200-strong unconference,\u00a0Living On The Egde, in Strasbourg, France. That was\u00a0about three thousand pages worth of high-quality content.\u00a0We aggregated them\u00a0into a report via ethnographic methods. Mission accomplished. </span>\n\n<span>And then something extraordinary happened: <strong>the community refused to go away</strong>. We see collaborations springing up everywhere (<a href=\"/list-of-past-and-present-collaborations\">work-in-progress list</a>), in complete disregard of\u00a0national borders; many more, undoubtedly, we are not seeing. Suddenly, it felt like everyone was engaged in constant interaction, having a go at big, scary, interesting\u00a0problems in a semi-coordinated way. This was way too good to let go. So, some of us spun off the website, started <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-should-we-morph-into-a-social-enterprise/1033\">a corporation</a>\u00a0to act as a scaffolding and energy source to keep the community going, and here we are now.\u00a0</span>\n\nOne of the projects that resulted from this interaction is called the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315\">unMonastery</a>, a new kind of institution that borrows elements from monastic life in 10th century Europe and repurposes them as a platform for collaboration and open innovation. It summarizes what I find so valuable in Edgeryders: the out-of-the-box thinking, the focus on delivery, the ease in making\u00a0alliances (in this case with the Italian city of Matera)\u00a0without giving up autonomy. Conceived at Living On The Edge, the unMonastery went from idea to prototype in less than a year: the building to host the prototype is being renovated as I write this. If we still needed any, this is living proof that we are willing and able to do the job that we came together for: colonize, expand and improve society, starting at the edges, because that's where the action is.\u00a0\n\nIt is clear that we \u2013 the Edgeryders already in the community, and those we will meet along the way \u2013 are powerful allies for each other. Just as importantly, we are<span>\u00a0a comforting presence</span> for each other in times of exhaustion, pessimism and defeat, which are frequent. <strong>So, here's the plan: we all meet in Matera for the next Living On The Edge</strong>. Our goal: tooling up and skilling up to get better and better at moving from talk to action. We have new tools at our disposal (Edgeryders-the-company and the unMonastery itself, perhaps others), but even if we did not one person's usual\u00a0tools and practices are new to another.\u00a0<span>We\u00a0do it in</span><span>\u00a0the unMonastery itself:</span><span>\u00a0it is a spectacular building and what the hell, we can use the energy boost that comes with seeing something like that come true. It will be like a pilgrimage: the unPilgrimage of Edgeryders from everywhere.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Whoever you are, wherever you are, if you see yourself in all this, consider coming over.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone's welcome, the best Edgeryders are those we have not met yet.\u00a0</span><span>The food will be good and the weather mild (this is, after all, Italy).

Elle d\u00e9signe ce qui nous manque dans notre courte vie sur terre. Elle embrasse la justice exigible.

Sans cette justice, aucun bonheur n'est possible pour aucun d'entre nous.\" (Jean Ziegler, <em>L'empire de la honte</em>)</li>\n\n<li>The second is far more ancient philosophy, but still working nowadays. Special thanks to the Roman imperator and Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius (Marc Aur\u00e8le in French), who let us know his <strong>three powerful rules of life</strong>, translated by the late Pr Pierre Hadot for Philosophie Magazine:\n\n\"Voir la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 telle qu'elle est, aimer les hommes et se mettre au service de la communaut\u00e9 humaine, accepter son destin.\" (Marcus Annius Verus, 121-180).</li>\n\n</ul>From utopy to human reality, these lines are a good introduction to the work of the cartographers of our changing world, aren't they, my friends?\n\n...See you on the Map !

He sent me a screenshot of the opening screen:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/50394d4c6153fb1643eecfe0094d5414a99664d4.jpg\" width=\"430\" height=\"331\">\n\nConvenience? Not by our standards. And yet, it flourished. What's more, the different forums (\"conferences\") had the exact same interface,\u00a0but very different cultures. The parenting conference\u00a0was caring and nurturing; the political conferences tended to be virtual places of aggression and shouting at each other. This story is narrated by @Howard_Rheingold in a fantastic book called <a href=\"http://www.rheingold.com/vc/book/\">The Virtual Community</a>.\u00a0\n\nSo, I think you are wise not to bank on the direct democracy software to sort everything out. In fact, I fear there is something in deliberation that erodes community... but this might just be me being too cautious. What are your experiences?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-13 19:11:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:20.299971", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 319, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7857, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1874, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Well, that's a surprise!</b>\n\nHy Lucyanna, and welcome back onto Edgeryders!

The star of the debate was fellow Edgeryder [Pietro Speroni di Fenizio], who has been devoting serious amounts of work to this in the past years.

Now I could paint this picture all roses &amp; sunshine, but I have to add that I was quite disappointed with the turn out. When we held the workshop over a month ago, there was mutual agreement that these meetings were something the participants, you, desperately needed. I have been facilitating this, because I agree it would be very beneficial for all. However, as the weeks go past, the turn out has been less and less. So, just a minor side note, I am not organizing this for me, or for Edgeryders, or for UNDP, I am setting these meetings up for you all, so you can benefit from it. If you don't show, you can't benefit from it. And the less people show up, the less beneficial it is for those who do: these meetings are there for you to share your project and ask for help where needed</span>.</span>\n\nNow, the good thing is that people have been showing up, and maybe not to all meetings, but there has been a consistency which I am grateful for. At this past meeting we discussed the following issues: Venue for the International Event, Social Activities, Hosting a session and Horizon2020.\u00a0\n\n<strong><span>Venue</span></strong>\n\n<span>Khatuna and I have found two venues! One is CCA, the center for contemporary art, a non-profit organization which aims to educate people and give artists a place to exhibit their art. They have a special program for underprivileged students to get an MA there for free and other projects. The chairperson, Wato, said he would also love to host a session on this linkage between education and art. The place itself is gorgeous, think Brooklyn Loft meets minimalism, meets georgian old architecture. The other venue is ISET, the economic department of Tbilisi State University. It is very central, has a beautiful garden, and has several different smaller rooms besides a conference room. Today Khatuna and I will decide and we'll let you know.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span><strong>Social Activities</strong></span>\n\n<span>There has been a lot of discussion what kind of social activities we could organize. The ideas we had previously: picnic, something volunteerish, like cleaning the park, a mapping activity, etc. Now, Bauhaus had offered us to cook at their cafe, they would provide us with a place to cook and we could bring the ingredients ourselves, we could all go to the Bazar and buy veggies and other ingredients. However, unfortunately Bauhaus has been having major problems with their neighbors and they'll be moving to a new venue in July. They are now discussing whether or not they can host us end of June... I will keep you updated about this.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Luckily, Nika from Vake Park offered to host several social after workshop activities at Vake Park. He will discus what interesting activities we can do, but ideas so far are: having games, make art/music, clean the park, have a picnic there. The great thing is that if we spend the afternoon/evening at Vake Park we have a solid after workshop program. Preferrably this would take place on the second day, the 25th.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Jeff, from Open Street Maps Georgia is interested in hosting a small mapping party, however, is not sure yet whether he'll be in the country around those dates. He will keep us updated.</span>\n\n<strong><span>Hosting a Session</span></strong>\n\nNika from Vake Park offered to host a session on community building. But he was a bit afraid of doing it, as he has never done it before. I told him I could co-host it with him, he will upload the event description soon! I am excited about his story and all other's regarding activating people for a cause, how to do it and what challenges everybody faces in their countries.\u00a0\n\n<strong><span>Horizon2020</span></strong>\n\n<span>Unfortunately Eric from Jumpstart is out of the country, but promised me he would take a look at the current proposal. Nika from was very excited to hear about this as well and would also give his constructive criticism soon. A very lucky coincidence is that Ninutsa happened to have contacts of the EC's person responsible for Horizon2020 in Georgia. It will be very easy to set up a meeting, but I would really need some more input into the document from others before I can go ahead and meet. Also, I would like Eric or someone else from Jumpstart to be there with me. <span>Mamaduka had also his two cents regarding the proposal. To him it seemed nonsense to ask money for setting up a program to teach a free software. According to him it goes against the ideology of open software to be paid to teach people.\u00a0</span></span>\n\n(ps: I can't seem to ping anyone, I have seen a post on it on the dev group, but it still hasnt been resolved?)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-03 08:07:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:17.389528", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 990, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 20.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 576, "user_id": 3422, "topic_id": 543, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<div class=\"content-area\" id=\"primary\">\n\n<main class=\"site-main\" id=\"main\" role=\"main\">\n\n<article class=\"post-11 page type-page status-publish hentry\" id=\"post-11\">\n\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\nIn 2014, I, Alberto Rey, had a solo museum exhibition at the Burchfield Penney Art Center. That project outlined the history and present conditions of the Scajaquada River. The river was buried under the city of Buffalo in the 1800\u2019s as a way to keep from dealing with the smell and pollution found in the water. Parts of the river remain buried and it continues to be polluted even as it is monitored by state and federal organizations.\u00a0 My research and installation took about three years to put together, and it presented the complexity of how economy, government policies, lack of planning, lack of accessible information and climate change can dramatically erode an environmental and cultural asset while creating insafe health issues to underserved populations.\n\nIt was during this installation that I was approached to consider doing a similar project about the Bagmati River that flows though the middle of Kathmandu, Nepal. After initial discussions with professionals, museum staff and community members in Kathmandu, it was clear that there was a great deal of interest in starting a new project investigating the Bagmati River. I was granted a residency at the Kathmandu Contemporary Arts Center a few months later, and my research began in earnest. Jason Dilworth, a colleague at the State University of New York and a graphic designer, joined the venture early in 2016 and his work has been integral to the project\u2019s success. During Jason\u2019s and my first trip to Kathmandu in March of 2016, we were able to strengthen past connections to the project while building a larger network of individuals and groups committed to improving conditions in the Kathmandu Valley and the communities outside the valley who live along the river. Support for the <em>Bagmati River Arts Project</em> has grown steadily from the beginning through the assistance of Hatchfund donors, travel support through SUNY Fredonia and a Burchfield Penney Art Center grant. It has continued to grow through the sales of the project\u2019s publications and the sales of my artwork.\n\n<span>The <i>Bagmati River Arts Project</i> (</span>http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/) <span>includes exhibitions, lectures and a website that houses a project\u00a0 overview, daily of blog of research in Kathmandu, sketchbooks, data, videos and links to the project's publication and documentary:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>an exhibition at the Siddhartha Art Gallery at Barbar Mahal Revisited in Kathmandu opening on November 20th, 2016. My artwork, water data from the Bagmati River and the video documentary will be presented on the second floor. The first will include artwork by Nepalese artists whose attention focuses with issues related to the Bagmati River and related health concerns in the area. We are also working with the fine art faculty and students at Kathmandu University who will be creating work related to their cultural connections to the river.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/project-publication-2/\">\u00a0a book</a> ,<em>Complexities of Water: Bagmati River, Nepal and Beyond</em>, is a publication that will examine how the holiest river in Nepal became spoiled by decades of pollution and policies that did not address issues related to climate change. It\u2019s present condition is a result of is the result of government mismanagement and oversight, lack of concern for underrepresented communities who live along its banks, and extreme flooding and droughts due to climate change. Recent reports have ranked Nepal as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change due to the high rate of urbanization, unchecked industrial development, severely low water supply, high pollution levels, increasingly frequent extreme floods and droughts, predictions of worsening conditions and lack of appropriate planning to mitigate or adapt to these conditions. Reports also list Nepal as an LDC (least developed country), which indicates its potential limitations to address these issues. This project hopes to bring international attention to this issue and hopefully some support to help provide finances to assist in addressing these issues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While examples of pollution and the effects of climate change can be found throughout Nepal, there is no better example of how bad the situation has become than what has happened to the Bagmati River. The river is the most sacred Hindu and Buddhist river in Nepal and its banks border the holiest Hindu temples and several UNESCO heritage sites. Yet, it is the most polluted river in Nepal. The Bagmati River is also a prime example of how adversely climate change can affect a community while, at the same time, highlighting the resiliency and commitment of the residents to continue the fight to mend their river. The importance of the river to the people of Nepal and residents of Kathmandu had resulted in inspiring city-wide community events that have tried to restore the sacred waters. While their efforts are admirable and have motivated government action, little has been done to mitigate climate change causes or to adapt communities to their present conditions or to future projections. The proposed book, documentary and related programming connects the science of water quality and climate change to effects of urban migration, social norms, economics, industrial development, and government policies. The book will also investigate how the river\u2019s condition has affected religious rituals and culture. The inclusion of interviews and artwork by professional artists whose work deals with the Bagmati River will provide a unique visual perspective on Kathmandu\u2019s cultural connection to the river. While the issues investigated are specific to Nepal and the Kathmandu Valley, the general causes of the pollution, degradation of the water and its connection to climate change is reflective of many rivers and communities throughout the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through aesthetically-interesting and related imagery, maps, and graphs, we hope to provide a new perspective on the interconnectedness of science, economics, environmentalism, health issues and art as it relates to the complexities of clean accessible water and the related social issues.

The poster and brochures will be distributed to the communities that live along the entire length of the river in Nepal. Members of the Bagmati River Expedition 2015 team, who created a comprehensive report about the river\u2019s water quality, microinvertebrates, avian population and plastics data, have already established connections in these communities. We have worked with Sujan Chitrakar and his graphic design students in designing the posters and brochures. Sujan is the Academic Program Coordinator and an Assistant Professor for Kathmandu University\u2019s School of Art, Center for Art and Design. We will be collaborating with the students at SUNY Fredonia to finish the design of the brochure and poster.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAll elements of the project listed above were finished and presented at the opening of the exhibition on November 20, 2016 at the Siddhartha Gallery in Kathmandu, Nepal.\n\nAn exciting extension to this project is to have the artwork, publication, documentary, brochures and posters tour the United States and internationally. The Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, New York is very interested in the merits of the project and they have volunteered to promote and organize the touring exhibition.Water issues are a worldwide concern and the Bagmati\u2019s perils are not unique. Our hope is that, by touring the exhibition and by combining it with site-specific exhibitions, audiences can create connections between their region and other global communities. There is a good deal that can be learned from the history of the Bagmati as well as from the grass roots efforts that created the Saturday Bagmati River clean-up program and the successful community health initiatives supported by the non-government organizations. All of these efforts has unified the underserved residents of the Kathmandu Valley to address the basic needs in their communities while creating hope and motivating government involvement.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor more information please contact <a href=\"mailto:alberto@albertorey.com\">alberto@albertorey.com</a>.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<hr>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Project Leaders</strong>\n\n<strong>Alberto Rey</strong> \u2013 Distinguished Professor in the Department of Visual Arts and New Media at the State University of New York at Fredonia and for the past 18 years has been the Director and Founder of Children in the Stream Youth Fly fishing Program (https://albertorey.com/s-a-r-e-p-youth-fly-fishing-program/).

I think it would be great to combine the Mapping the Commons toolset into a sort of methodology for unMonastery, which can assist developmental innovation (such as unTransit) to target issues that are perceived as critical by local people by conducting interviews on the ground, and also come up with \"let's make it together\" activities which extend it to skill sharing and so make it empowering. Kind of a padding around the actual hackathon.\n\nI don't have numbers at hand, but I would say, 4 months of expenses for 2 people (8 months total) to stay at the unMonastery\u00a0in exchange for conducting the offline research, in the forms of interviews, required conditions: summary of each interview (and if people allow, full material) published online, and a longer analysis of method and findings, at the end; involve local initiatives; together design (and write up) workshop(s) or other activities that would embed the outcome of the HaHa in the local community and write a report on the workshop outcomes in the end.\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/u/mariabyck\">@mariabyck</a>, <a href=\"/u/lucia\">@Lucia</a>, <a href=\"/u/anon\">@Bezdomny</a>\u00a0what do you think?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-24 16:53:45", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:46.769722", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 209, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2161], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7643, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5876, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>No.</b>\n\nMost of our team will be on the road next week. :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-22 13:05:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:44.641030", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1434, "user_id": 27, "topic_id": 1401, "post_number": 1, "raw": "At the Assembl\u00e9e nationale, Salle Lamartine, Paris\n\n<strong>What was it?</strong>\n\nYesterday there was a very interesting conference aiming to promote open government in the French-speaking world. There was a very diverse group of citizens, democracy advocates, local elected officials, members of parliament, researchers (sociology, political science, economists, etc.) developers, activists, civil servants et al. The choice of venue in the Assembl\u00e9e nationale suggested a real desire to connect grass-roots and high-level policy makers. There were representatives from a range of countries: Tunisia, Switzerland, France, Belgium and Quebec.\n\n<strong>Basically</strong>\n\nParticipants want more open data, more open government and more participative processes in the search of:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><span>Transparency</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Participation</span></li>\n\n<li><span>Collaboration</span></li>\n\n</ol>The candidness and honesty expressed in regretting the slow uptake of open government principles in the French-speaking world should be applauded for its self-awareness and high potential for sparking change; as should the rigour and analysis of both the impact and implications of open government in their respective countries.\n\n<strong>Tools showcased</strong>\n\nThese factors of resistance explain to some extent the tentativeness and nervousness of projects aiming to introduce more open government into French-speaking politics. There are undoubted benefits to the tools on display:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><span>greater access to information that influences decision-making and lawmaking via a very navigable, aesthetically pleasing website that also enables comments and contributions from one and all (Parlement&amp;Citoyens); </span></li>\n\n<li><span>better informed and reasoned choices in election campaigns through a visually stunning website comparing candidates and all their declarations, statements, interviews, debates etc. (</span><a href=\"http://www.voxe.org/\"><u>www.voxe.org</u></a>) (as an aside \u2013 hackathons organised by Voxe push the boat out a lot more, searching for innovation in open government);</li>\n\n<li><span>enhanced, more widespread, and accessing normally unheard opinions of social networkers, while breaking down the policies of candidates into understandable chunks, (</span><a href=\"http://www.tuttivox.fr/\"><u>www.tuttivox.fr</u></a>) makes the democratic processes of elections more enticing to a wider public.</li>\n\n<li><span>(</span><a href=\"http://www.propx.fr/\"><u>www.propx.fr</u></a>) goes further in my opinion by enabling participants to go beyond the politician\u2019s narrow framing of debate, aspiring more to promote collaboration in politics rather than the implicit encouragement resulting from the three other tools.</li>\n\n<li><span>In a different way, </span>Tunisia\u2019s PDP\u2019s Open Congress website promotes collaboration within the existing policy debate by explicitly encouraging debate on major policy themes (<a href=\"http://www.vousparticipez.com/\"><u>www.vousparticipez.com</u></a>)\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol><strong>And so</strong>\n\nThe thirst and enthusiasm for open government is clearly there, as is impressive technical skill and design.

Alberto fears that some people might perceive LOTE as a closed event. The problem is the participant-only policy of the event: registering doesn\u2019t mean filling in a form but getting through a much more complicated streamline of information. Alberto suggests that the participant rule can be more relaxed as we go towards the event, at that point the most active people already engaged and we might as well allow more people in.\n\nA solution could be to write to several people/organizations that already heard/are interested in LOTE this:\n\n<em>hey, we're very keen on meeting more people in Brussels. Let us know if you're coming, and here's what's on the menu. And by the way, come meet us at the Apero.</em>\n\nI mean more elaborate but this is the message.\n\n<strong>Logistics onsite</strong>: how do we arrange rooms so that can host the right amount of people? The same for lunch/dinner. Noemi: how many go to which session is not so big a deal, you have assigned rooms and people go where they fit. They can always move chairs around if there's need. Meals are at fixed times, so what we'll need to do is approximate the number of participants every day the best we can. Irene: Rooms are on different levels, it might be messy. For foods ok but we cannot afford a 50% error on the expected number. We still need to go for groceries before.\n\n<strong>Documentation task</strong>: <a href=\"/u/nadia\" style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19.2px; line-height: 43.52px;\">@Nadia</a>\u00a0is involving video makers for the Storytelling workshop.

Welcome to point out if not :)\n\nThe fact that it's named LETS (Local Exchange Trading System) is because the idea of keeping money local makes it less scarce for everybody involved. For example, there can be high transaction costs to convert the alternative currency into Euros, motivating people to spend it in the LETS community rather than for (a bit cheaper) external products and services. And the second working principle behind LETS is that now everybody, not just banks, can create \"money\", again making it less scarce. (\"Money\" in - cashless - LETS is still a contract about debt, just as when banks create it.)\n\nNow there seems to be no principal problem to apply LETS to a larger scale - \"local\" actually means \"the community where the currency circulates\", not necessarily geographical neighborhood. So far, I know the following widescale LETS equivalents:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.community-exchange.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Community Exchange System</a>. A meta system containing hundreds of LETSs worldwide, with an ability to convert between all these currencies. Just like forex exchanges in the world of legal tender.</li>\n\n<li>Internet based barter platforms that use a credit point system, with no way to convert between credits and Euros. A relatively well-known example from Germany is <a href=\"http://www.kleiderkreisel.de/\">kleiderkreisel.de</a>.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_monetary_system\">Ripple</a>. Ripple is a web-of-trust extension of the LETS system, avoiding the group trust necessity that keeps LETSs local.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.multiswap.net/about/\">Circular Multilateral Barter</a>. An ingenious idea for circular bartering without local restrictions, a bit like Ripple, but with more flexibility in transactions. The idea is a bit hard to get, I only did after <a href=\"http://ma.juii.net/blog/time-banking-software-recommendation#comments\">a discussion with the developer on my blog</a>.</li>\n\n</ol>Of course there's also <a href=\"http://bitcoin.org/\">Bitcoin</a>. It's attractive on its own terms (and yes I have some), because it does not depend on any central authority (like central banking) and has zero transaction costs worldwide. Yet it does not have any of the advantages of LETS over money: Bitcoin and Euro etc. are readily exchangeable, and Bitcoin is not created from P2P credit. Both limit its supply, meaning it is just as hard to earn Bitcoin than it is to earn \"real\" money.\n\nSo unlike LETS, Bitcoin as a system does nothing to overcome money scarcity (to the contrary, it even includes built-in deflation). Yet again, it could readily replace LETS within a community that decides to keep the currency local, because people <em>want</em> to be an autarkic group rather than being nudged to that by LETS principles. This latter case seems optimum to me: where you voluntarily decide to buy your community's products, to build up your own community economy and help improve these products, rather than spending it for big business products that are nominally cheaper but bring dependence on earning money in the formal economy with all its regulations and wastefulness.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-17 21:16:34", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:42.490878", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 551, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12713], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13435, "user_id": 31, "topic_id": 1662, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>AN ASIDE ON FLU: numbers, fear, alternative medicines, and plans</b>\n\nI'll try and keep this short and to the point. I find flu fascinating, but wouldn't want to drown in it!\n\nI honestly don't think the official <strong>numbers</strong> were wrong. Here's what I know about it:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Flu viruses cause a wide range of symptoms, from no-symptoms-at-all in maybe 30% of all infections, to death in maybe about 1-2 in 10000, and severe cases are counted more easily. Countries differ widely in diagnostic capabilities, which also change along time (once the pandemic was \"certified\" there was no point in sending many samples to the virology labs, which were overwhelmed anyway). So official numbers - at least with flu - are known to be <strong>only part of the picture</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>Even so, starting in 2009, people in the know (including those of us who worked with our local systems to count cases and make the best possible estimates), started building a coherent picture pretty soon (October 2009?): \"this flu is abundant, not as deadly as feared, but it disproportionately kills the young\". New figures, if I read them correctly, have brought solidity and comparability.</li>\n\n<li>All of this proved hard to communicate: the full picture about the present was distorted by part of the media (those who focused on the relative small number of deaths, without mentioning the very large number of mild cases), and probably by everyone's uncertainty about the future. One key lesson is numbers can't be given alone, without sharing the understanding of how those numbers are arrived at.</li>\n\n</ul>You mention \"panic\", and I agree it's not a useful term. <strong>Fear</strong> can be appropriate (if say 5% of those who fall ill die, do I send kids to school? most likely not!), and public attention is best guided to real data, real uncertainties, and open talk about sensible <strong>behaviours</strong>. Not always done, I know! I think what matters most is behaviours: slowing down the spread of the virus, helping food supplies move along, etc.\n\nRegarding what we might call <strong>\"alternative medicines\"</strong>, I know different people have different views of what works and doesn't work. Personally I prefer to stick with the scientific method as a way of inquiry, and apply it to all alternatives:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>To start with an example from \"official science\", it has been suggested that some generic pharmaceuticals might be useful in the next pandemic, and some studies have been done, but apparently we can't be sure yet. If a bad pandemic were to start before those better studies are done, we'd start flying by the seat of our pants.</li>\n\n<li>I claim no knowledge about what's been labled as \"alternative medicine\". Some of those alternatives will work (and then become official!), but some won't (if their effects are better attributable a) to natural variations in diseases and people, which let us believe almost anything from the same data; or b) to the very real placebo effects). As with the other options, we'll use whatever makes sense to us.</li>\n\n</ul>Regarding <strong>planning</strong>, the recent papers on how bird flu might become transmissible (at least in ferrets) might signal a renewed interest, but we'll see.\n\nBack to the financial meltdown scenario?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-27 23:49:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:15.967814", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 585, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 25.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 5, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2593, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2560, "post_number": 1, "raw": "The calls to action on the Spot the Future website and social media will translate key issues highlighted by participants in the Post2015 consultations translate them into research questions.

One angle which could be promising for Spot the Future is making a case about entrepreneurship in Armenia, beyond business as usual, so as to include innovation.\u00a0\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<strong>Research Questions :</strong> What are the risks experienced by Armenian entrepreneurs? what are some of the tested successful paths beyond the discouraging/ disadvantageous government deal?\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<strong><a id=\"unemploymentunderunderemploymentpoorworkingconditions\" name=\"unemploymentunderunderemploymentpoorworkingconditions\"></a>2)\u00a0Unemployment, u</strong><strong>nderemployment or poor working conditions</strong>: most vulnerable are women and youth; incompatibility between employers\u2019 requirements and the way the education system prepares young professionals.

In \u201cTranslation\u201d, we explain how this affects the Spot the Future audience, and how the approach of consulting them has to be adapted to the unique features of this demographic group. Then in \u201cResearch questions\u201d, we come up with adequate questions that can guide what we do in the Spot the Future research project.\n\n<h3>Instructions for online community builders</h3>\n\nPlease select (or add) those challenges and research questions that you want us to dig into with the Spot the Future Egypt project (we simply can\u2019t do all of them properly, so we ask for your priorities; 2-4 items from the list will do, ordered by priority). Note, both challenges and research questions are only proposals. You are more than welcome to add to them or propose different ones, according to your priorities. We recommend to frame research questions so that they focus on hands-on activities, initiatives and experiences \u2013 metal-level talk is disengaging for, well, all of us :)\n\n<h4>\n\n<a id=\"unemploymentandeconomicdeceleration\" name=\"unemploymentandeconomicdeceleration\"></a>(1) Unemployment and macro-economic deceleration</h4>\n\nEgypt\u2019s current difficult macroeconomic situation is largely attributed to the difficulties of adjusting to the post-Revolution situation. The wave of increasing violence that followed caused tourism and foreign business activity to decline and makes investors reluctant to start business activity in Egypt.\n\nIn effect, the unemployment rate increased from 8.9% (2010) to 13.4% (2013). Unemployment disproportionately affects youth: 3 out of 4 unemployed persons are youth (18-29), a group with a total share of 1 of 4 of the population. And within youth, esp. women: 21% of young men, but 50% of young women are unemployed.\n\nWith unemployment comes labor migration: 39% of the unemployed intend to migrate abroad [1, p.7+4]. Also, high corruption was cited as something that causes the costs of doing business to be often prohibitively high. Employers complain about the quality of technical professional education, and the work ethic of the young (\u201cThey all want a desk job and a high salary\u201d) [1, p.12+4]\n\nTranslation.\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<strong>Edgeryders approach: </strong>The employment statistics of the formal economy usually do not fully acknowledge the existence of the underground economy (\u201cSystem D\u201d), which comes with its own set of challenges and solutions. Since unemployment affects the young disproportionately, it could be worth a look what unorthodox solutions to economic exclusion they try and find.\n\n<strong>Research questions:\u00a0</strong>How do entrepreneurial careers of young people look when they have to start from economic exclusion? How do they find support and a market for their work, products or services, and what role does the informal economy play in that? What support (also esp. by government policies) is needed by these persons with self-managed, informal careers?\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><strong><a id=\"poverty\" name=\"poverty\">(2) Poverty</a></strong></h4>\n\n<blockquote>\n\nPoverty is seen as damaging the human security of affected households, but also (in the form of regional inequalities) as a threat to Egypt\u2019s development path itself. More than 75% of the young (up to 29 years old) reside in rural and frontier regions, so youth is disproportionately affected by poverty.\n\n<strong>Edgeryders approach: </strong>Poverty is often gauged by monetary household income, which is convenient for statistics. However there are other, only partially overlapping approaches: subjective poverty (self-designation as \u201cpoor\u201d) and poverty qualitatively defined by access to different tools, services and infrastructure. In the latter approach, more money is not the only way to meet ones needs and emerge from poverty. It seems promising to track the ways how the young try to access the resources of a non-poor life (apart from the usual but often defeated attempt to find a well-paying job).\n\n<strong>Research question: </strong>What non-monetary means have young Egyptians found to meet personal needs? How does this inform questions about Egypt\u2019s development potential and its strategies for food and water security? Special focus should be on the tech community: hackers and makers, esp. in areas like agriculture, urban farming, sharing economy, renewable energy, alternative dwelling.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>\n\n<a id=\"environmentaldegradation\" name=\"environmentaldegradation\"></a>(3) Environmental degradation</h4>\n\nThis is seen as a problem inter alia because it makes food and water security hard to achieve and sustain for Egypt\u2019s growing population. Lack of political commitment and poor natural resource management are seen as the main reasons of environmental degradation.\u00a0<strong>Energy scarcity</strong> is an issue that is expected to exacerbate in coming years, since energy consumption of Egypt is extrapolated to triple by 2030 [1, p.21+4].\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<strong>Edgeryders approach</strong>: Again, the research should probably start by discovering direct action by individuals and groups (because that is what is left to people when they are removed, or disenfranchised, from large-scale political discourse and decision making). Not stopping at this, we can then inquire for their ideas for a nation-wide solution to environmental problems. This could inform solutions that work in spite of lacking political commitment.\n\n<strong>Research questions:\u00a0</strong>How do young Egyptians take up and express their concern for their natural environment? How do they see a large-scale solution for pollution, littering and environmental degradation? What initiatives are experimenting with small-scale solutions?\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2><a id=\"Georgia Topics\" name=\"Georgia%20Topics\">POST 2015 - Topics for Georgia</a></h2>\n\nThe post2015 consultations report presents findings resulted from the application of a mixed methodology: web and household survey data and facilitated group consultations. Over 10000 people were engaged in the process, out of which 725 in physical group discussions.\n\nOverall, Georgians\u2019 priorities do not differ much from the citizens\u2019 at global level: good education (prioritized among urban youth), better healthcare, better job opportunities + support for people who cannot work, honest and responsive government. Georgians also rank high protection against crime, affordable &amp; nutritious food, physical and social security (among elderly), access to clean water and sanitation.\n\nObservation: Survey data makes it unclear whether these are the things Georgians care most about or the areas they think need most urgent intervention/improvement. The information on the detailed perceptions of citizens, outside formal ranking of pre-designed options, is a good food for thought for Spot the Future, because it offers a plethora of opportunities to challenge it. Could it be that a less determined choice of alternatives and especially different framing of \u201cpriorities\u201d yields different results in terms of how citizens identify with issues?\n\n<h3>From challenges to research questions</h3>\n\nThe following topics are priorities as perceived by the UNDP Georgia team. Please prepare one mission brief per topic in English and Georgian. Perhaps you feel something is missing? If so add another mission brief (s) for the new topics.\n\n<h4>\n\n<a id=\"Participationindecisionmaking\" name=\"Participationindecisionmaking\"></a>(1)<strong> Participation in decision making</strong>\n\n</h4>\n\nCivic engagement: \u201caccording to respondents such involvement required a secure and empowering environment, \u00a0the ability and possibility to speak and to be heard, an agreed vision of \u00a0where to go and how, and \u00a0having at least medium living standards. An honest and responsive government was perceived as a precondition for creating such an enabling environment. Participants also named other necessary conditions for their engagement - responsible citizens and well developed civil society as well as institutionalized channels for participation.\u201d (source: Georgian preliminary Post2015 consultations report). The UNDP country team suggests further research on the real degree to which people participate, beyond social networks and off to real social activity\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<strong>Edgeryders approach:</strong> It used to be that youth policy around participation was focused on bringing youth into the institutional forms of participation. In Edgeryders we are seeing how youth are active in creating their own initiatives and spaces that work with different kinds of procedures and practices than institutional politics. And civil/ political participation is not some activity or engagement separated from the rest of their lives - youth become political as thoughtful consumers or boycotters, as adopters of alternative currencies (sharing as opposed to buy-sell practices), as users of particular digital tools (eg the free software movement) etc. We make choices that are in themselves political and lie outside formalized, institutional spaces. That is also civic participation (source)\n\n<strong>Research Questions:</strong> What initiatives are individuals involved in, practically, to influence decision making or get a political point of view across? What are the spaces and channels they deem most trustworthy? What kind of projects have succeeded in building empowerment and re-building legitimacy among citizenry?\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><strong><a id=\"responsivegovernment\" name=\"responsivegovernment\"></a>(2) Responsive government</strong></h4>\n\nThis seems an encompassing issue, the general feeling being that without government things cannot change: \u201cgovernment bred passivity in people, as a result people had little trust in it\u201d, \u201dAn honest and responsive government was perceived by all the participants of the consultation as the central issue necessary for solving problems in any other sphere\u201d (source: Georgian preliminary Post2015 consultations report). The rather singular point of view different was of a returned labour migrant: \u201cThe government helps you, but you also should try yourself. It\u2019s not like the government is apart and we are apart, we are all together.\u201c\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<strong>Edgeryders approach:</strong> Citizens distrust in their governments is a generalized issue that is common to European citizens everywhere, and beyond. Nothing new here. What if we turn it upside down and invite local government people to share their experience? A sort of \u201cGovernment with a human face\u201d mission to break the silos between what people perceive as the big black box of government and the (sometimes) well intended public servants? This could also contribute to a valuable perspective on the issue of building trust in government, which was mentioned by participants as a step forward.\n\n<strong>Research Questions: </strong>Are there civil servants who are innovating from the inside?

Basically the gum is a \u201ctime killer\u201d, the no boredom forever is guaranteed! This factory has a set of shareholders and a board of directors. The shareholders live from the rent coming of their actions and decided that every year the company must increase its revenues by 10%. The board is responsible for directing the activities of the company and control that the goal of increasing annual sales by 10% is met. To help them to fulfill their purpose efficiently, they are receiving very high salaries, and also they receive an annual bonus according to the compliance of the year.\n\nThe factory has a finances, human resources, marketing, production, and systems department, which are all coordinated to meet that goal of everlasting increasing of revenues. As an example, the marketing department strives to design and develop communication strategies that aim to increase consumption of the gum. The finances department wants to reduce the different costs of operation, including the distribution, so they asked the system department to develop new software in order to better control the distribution.\n\nI'm working at the system department as a software developer, so, I'm working hard with the distribution software asked by the Finances department. Right now, the pressure cause we must finish the software in a given date, so I'm stressed, tired and with really scarce free time. In fact it is being a long time that I'm not almost seeing my family. I'm seeing them one hour at morning and another one at night, the weekends are worse, cause I'm going out also to work. Really I'm dreaming with the normal times, when I had enough time to expend with them, a time where we sat together and chew the gum that entertains us so well. Or better yet, take a vacation and spend all day chewing this wonderful gum, really I can not imagine what people did in the past without this gum.\n\nI heard rumors that the gum production is devastating the planet, that with the current growth rate in production we are using more and more land and resources, and that at some time in the future there will be not enough and that our resources will be degraded. But surely that is what alarmist say, they are no using enough the gum so they are not enjoying enough, no seeing the undoubted gum's benefits. I guess that the best thing in life is to become a shareholder of a company like I'm working now. In that case, I will not need to work anymore, and I'll have all the time for me. What will I do with this time? Hmm, I don't know, I guess I will be chewing more gum .. I don't know, I'll think about that at this time. I must admit that I'm a bit bored with my job. I don't know why, I'm working in a good company and doing an important and recognized work. Besides, if I'm going to another company, I would be doing basically the same. There aren't chances to do different things over there. Things are more or less organized, and we should be really lucky for that.\n\nThus, this is the way that my life is going on, working the best part of my life in a company that produces a gum that people is using in their free time, to kill this free time. And it will remains the same until the day I'll be able to retire. Then I'll be as a shareholder, I'll have all my time free and I'll be able to chew the gum all the day, until finally at some point, I will be going to my eternal rest, cause I guess that is what I want, because otherwise, why I was killing my time all my life?\n\n<strong>***** The end of the little tale ****</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\nGenerally speaking, the little tale depicted above is more and less what is what is happening to most of us who are fortunate enough to not to be fighting daily for the basic needs to live. And what I can say is that there is something deeply disturbing in a society that is making of this tale its lifestyle and even it is considering it desirable. So, what we need is to reinvent ourselves from the bottom up. We need need innovate from the bottom-up in order to redefine our relationships, in how we are relating to each other with the aim to give everyone a chance to a fully life, but not a life as is described in the tale, but a fully life with autonomy, mastery and purpose, a life where each minute has real value and we just aren't killing the time.\n\nSo, how we are redefining the relationships structure of our society from the bottom-up? The only way we can achieve something is to <b>organize and act</b>. Or what is the same, we must <b>institutionalize the power</b> that all of us who want that change have, of which the Edgeryders community 's members are a small sample. But just in the process of institutionalizing the power, i.e. creating the structures necessary for it to work, it is also where resides the greatest danger. Because if we are using the same structures as always, the most likely to happen is that if the movement succeeds, when it reaches a certain volume, the same structures created to mediate the power are becoming disconnected from its base, which is ourselves, and begin a domination process that ultimately distorts all the original intentions for which those institutions were created.\n\nSo it is true that we have to organize by creating the necessary structures to manage our power to reinvent ourselves as. But the priority first step on that path, is to innovate in the shape that these structures will have to avoid the danger that they are becoming through the time divorced from its true power base, us. The humanity has been innovating at a fast growing pace on technologies and other areas, but there is no innovation in our power structures, they remain in the same basic design from when we started to organize in groups. And it is this that staticity that we must challenge finding better ways to institutionalize our political power. That is the very first thing to think before any change, because otherwise, in the medium to long term we will be again in the situation that we want to escape right now. We have the desire, the tools and know that<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/new_structures.jpg\"> <b>obediential power</b> and <b>healthy hierarchies</b>/<b>heterarchies</b></a> are the way if used well, then <i>how do we develop the context and structures to institutionalize a real power obediential?</i> And using these new structures we can organize ourselves to reinvent our relationships from the bottom-up, <i>how should we organize ourselves to achieve that change from the bottom up?</i>\n\nCome to the<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/living-together-session/mission_case/implementing-real-social-project-case-european-commission\"> Living together</a> session to start to answer these question through a <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/new_deal.pdf\">conversation</a>, but not only talking, also help to start a little practical experiment that allows us to answer these questions through real life changes, and also serve at the same time as a seed to start to redefine the relationships structure of our society from the bottom-up. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe have the desire, the tools (Internet, the co-philosophies, etc.) and the required knowledge, we must start to organize those pieces and experiment with them in order to discover through conversations and actions in real life the way for the change; a society where everyone has the opportunity to live a full life.

My very first tour this week goes to Ghent, where I already have connected with potential participants. It will be a chance for me to see in what ways I can connect with groups. How to talk to people about trauma? How to equip them with knowledge and capacity to deal with their own experiences? And what could \u00a0be a possible model for sustaining the project, as I really want to go far with my tour, reaching the Balkans, Greece, visit communities out there.

I\u2019ve already taken a step towards promoting awareness and dealing with the problem - I wrote a book about trauma last year. The book became quite popular, and it\u2019s now being translated from Dutch to English. It will be available in January, and it is based on common licence, along with the exercises included.

Based on the experiences from last year, it seems to me that:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>We should commit to \"loose and fast\". Since Edgeryders has an \"in situ\" culture, which simply clashes with the CCC way of planning sessions and workshops. On top of that, there might not even be a food-hacking base to latch onto. I propose that, instead of trying to force ourselves to pre-plan everything, we ask for an open space to run \"in situ\" stuff. Failing that, I would suggest we think of ways of organising activities in \"unplanned\" spaces. Think picnic in the hallway, mini-stage-performances/talks during the breaks, etc. Hacking the hackers, so to say. Yes, the Germans will probably flip their shit a bit, but if we're nice about it, we'll all survive, no?</li>\n\n<li>Communicating \"where we do what\" is a challenge both in-group as towards the rest of 32c3, especially if we commit to doing \"ad hoc\" activities. I'm thinking having only one channel where we keep all communication could be beneficial, so we can point everyone to the one and only \"true source of truth\". Not sure what would serve this role best though. Digital/non-digital? Our own or 32c3 (wiki) tools?</li>\n\n<li>Content-wise, I'm thinking of focusing on fun, process-oriented activities, rather than specific topics. I definitely had fun organising Agape meals and there's so much more like that. Joe Edelman (who ran one of the Agape tables) made a fantastic overview of ideas here:\u00a0http://nxhx.org/societies/\n\nI know at least half a dozen other things we could do. We could organise \"guided tours\" to specific talks, with before/after workshops, etc etc.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<span>Overall, I think bringing a heavy dose of humanity, combined with expertise in \"spontaneous organisation\" would be best suitable for being present as Edgeryders. Obviously this is not something I can do by myself, so the question is: anyone out there willing to truly commit to this? I think running one activity per day per Edgeryder is more or less the baseline for having some consistency.</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-09 12:38:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:41.506643", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 408, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10114, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1412, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>The stuff of dreams</b>\n\nHello Aubrey, and thanks for sharing this.

Our vision is to see an engaged, able and empowered student body that are active in shaping the future of Ireland.\n\nMyself and a friend started the society in September 2011 and our aim of empowering students has really shaped our year.\n\nFirstly I want to tell you a little about me and then I will explain our society, what we have done so far and what is next!\n\nSo, I come from a poor, working-class area of Dublin and I have a lot of views and opinions on everything, from society to politics to the environment. In Ireland people generally don't discuss major worldwide issues, which is a pity becuase our youth are so intelligent! I'm studying a business degree through the medium of the Irish language. I love the Irish language and culture and it makes me angry and sad that our indigenous language is not our primary one. Someday I believe it will be revived and I hope I live to see that day. I have strong values and I love reading inspiring quotes. Two quotes that I have built my values on are; 1. Consider it the greatest sin, to prefer life to honour, and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living for. 2. May the best years of your life be the ones that you are living now. I think that a lack of honour and conviction are one of the biggest problems in Irish society today, something that is very evident in our government! I also think that one should constantly be trying to grow and improve as a human being, always staying open minded, ready to accept that your ideas or opinions may be wrong but also be strong enough to fight for something knowing that you might be wrong but hoping that you will learn. Learning should never stop.\n\nIt is with these values that I founded my social initiative. It is one which aims to give Irish students a wake up call. THE WORLD IS NOT OK! Things need fixing and it is us that needs to fix them. We need to become more socially aware, more economically aware, we need to wake up! This is what we want to achieve, we want to wkae people up, show them the issues in the world that need to be dealt with and then give them the skills to go and fix the problem, grasp the oppurtunity or address the need.\n\nOur motto is, Engage, Equip, Empower. This is how we work. We engage students, for example we ran a Boxing fundraiser in the college, students trained and then fought each other, We raised over \u20ac6000 euro and we made people aware of who we are and our aims.

We ask young Europeans if they are members in a political organization and how they feel they can make a difference or if politicians listen to what they have to say. The reasoning behind this inquiry is that surveys point to a growing lack of involvement on youths\u2019 part and a gloomy future of party politics. A decreasing participation at the polls and a widening age gap in turnout are no news when it comes to youth in established democracies around the world (a graphic example from Canada can be seen <a href=\"http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2010-19-e.htm\">here</a>). Only 5 percent or Europeans aged 15-29 were involved with a political organization at the end of 2011. The general decline in youth party membership was obvious years ago and led scholars to conclude that <em>if young people abandon youth organizations of political parties now, it will become more likely that, in future decades too, political parties will find it increasingly difficult to attract new members</em>.<sup><a href=\"http://profs-polisci.mcgill.ca/stolle/Publications_files/youthpartypolitics2004.pdf\">1</a></sup> \u00a0So it makes sense to talk about formal participation, and even more so in times when it competes with new channels available to influence decision-making. Research from the 70s and 80s consistently showed that a young person with good socio-economic background, coupled with some extra-curricular activities in school is more likely to become interested and actively involved in politics as an adult than her counterpart with a lower status. \u00a0A generation after that, it appears that education or civicness no longer help us anticipate who becomes political and who doesn\u2019t, or what to do when not enough of us young people participate. <strong>What causes youth not to follow the steps of their parents and grandparents?</strong> There are several hypotheses scholars and observers rely on to explain decreasing poll numbers, here are some I find most convincing<sup>2</sup>:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Later maturation</strong>: from a generational perspective, young people today get married, become full-time employed and have children at a later stage in life, after a longer schooling period than before. The mechanism through which they build community ties and become acquainted with politics is postponed to a later age, and conversely so is their growth into citizens engaged politically. In a way, if they\u2019re not tax payers in their early twenties, they don\u2019t see participation as having direct impact on their lives.<sup><a href=\"http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/13614/2010_SMETS.pdf?sequence=2\">3</a></sup></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Disenchantment</strong>: low turnout is but the tip of the iceberg in the so called disenfranchisement of young people. Youth perform badly over other dimensions of political engagement as well: recruitment numbers are low, same are levels of political knowledge<em>,</em> efficacy and trust in both institutions and politicians; sometimes they are labeled as cynical or frustrated because of refusal to engage, but this is not the same as apathy or disinterest. The argument that follows is: if there is indeed disengagement, this is with dominant forms of political participation and often occurs after attempts to matter. <em>So it\u2019s not about total lack of interest, it\u2019s that they do not trust to make a difference through electoral politics</em>.<sup><a href=\"http://www.tasa.org.au/conferences/conferencepapers07/papers/63.pdf\">4</a></sup></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Personalization of politics</strong>: this regards the hypothesis that although youth associate politics with institutional hegemony, they do engage, but in a less conventional way, by choosing what really interests them; young generations express their identities in individualized ways, for example by taking part in single-issue campaigning or New Social Movements (like environmentalist groups) rather than mainstream politics; some forms of social activism, namely those non-normative (e.g. violent, illegal protests), can even be negatively correlated with voting; also, qualitative studies show that the locus of politics may be found in the private sphere, in everyday doing, solving community problems, voluntary work and other activities which are political per se.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Diversification of media channels and technology</strong> have changed how youth are socialized into politics, the speed and scale of mobilization etc. but depending on their use they can nurture participation or can have a backsliding effect. In 2008 the American author Martin Wattenberg argued in his book <em>Is Voting for Young People? With a Postscript on Citizen Engagement </em>that young people lack the political information and interest necessary to show up at the polls because they are not newspaper readers and don\u2019t watch news television, so they are less exposed to political matters as older voters are. Studies on internet use, on the other hand, yield inconsistent results, probably because it\u2019s more difficult to measure different types of uses.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhich of the above resonates with you or is more convincing? <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/user/register/\">Join</a> the platform and talk about your experience directly with the community. Also, if you are aware of alternative logics for youth disengagement with electoral politics, please comment below and help us get a fuller picture! Finally<strong>, why is it important to talk about youth participation?</strong> Literature is consensual in that participation is a stable behavior after the onset of adulthood. Assuming that young people don\u2019t bother to go to the polls today means they won\u2019t do it in the future either<sup>7</sup>, and so the crisis of representative democracy will deepen even further. Who will elect our officials if not a small minority?<sup>8</sup> If indeed they are turning away, institutions are responsible to look into why this happens and how to bring them closer.\n\n<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/we-people/reactivating-democratic-institutions\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9957029cbeeb746da54673a2e2aa5752369fc32f.png\" width=\"557\" height=\"499\">\n\n</a>\n\n<span>Notes</span>\n\n<sup>2</sup> These hypotheses have been launched and tested in relation with North American and Western European countries, much less is clear in Northern and Eastern Europe. The later maturation in particular has only been tested at aggregate level, so it may not explain individual choice of not voting.\n\n<sup>7</sup> According to the habitual voting theory, some people always vote and some people always don\u2019t vote, it\u2019s a habit acquired particularly in the first two or three elections a young individual is called to participate in. To put it simple, the easiest way to predict if someone will vote or not is to look at whether they voted in the previous election. Scholars have turned to this developmental model of voting so as to find an explanation to the paradox of rational choice: in our decision to vote we weigh the cost and benefit of influencing results and so rationally speaking we would always abstain, as our vote is not likely to make a difference.

However, in my opinion there is a difference\u00a0between asking people to reflect on their choices, and institutionalising the ability to make the decisions for them. Or demanding that people stretched thin put time and effort into building consensus before moving in any direction,\u00a0which is hugely time and energy consuming (unless 1) you are willing to design, prototype and implement a lightweight mechanism for doing so and are successful in engaging everyone in the community in it\u00a0 2) can present compelling evidence that doing so would increase the community members'\u00a0ability to achieve their\u00a0objectives).\u00a0Especially at the stage where we are balancing the work of keeping the community going and\u00a0figuring out how to effectively use the corporate shell to enable people to bridge the gap between the need to build\u00a0(for them)\u00a0meaningful\u00a0things and support one another in making a living, together.\n\nMy primary interest is a corporate shell that\u00a0enables\u00a0us\u00a0to both interface with mainstream society AND\u00a0do and build things with others in free-floating constellations and self-organising swarms.

This time there will be very limited budget, no official funding so we've to figure out some things on our own.<strong> Mainly how to get there and where to stay.</strong> We are trying to organize this so it'll be as cheap as possible for everyone who wishes to attend. <strong>Are you coming?</strong> <strong>Let us know, as soon as possible!</strong> We'll need to have a good idea who's going to show up as soon as possible so it'll be easier to organize everything!\n\n<strong>How to get there?</strong>\n\nThere are cheap flights, bus and train tickets available to Brussels, but you've to <strong>book now</strong>. If not, carpooling, hitch hiking and websites as <a title=\"Mit fahr gelegenheit\" href=\"http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de\" target=\"_blank\">Mit fahr gelegenheit</a> could be a viable option for some people.\n\n<strong>Where to stay?</strong>\n\nWe'll try to fix a free or at least cheap accommodation for everyone. Do you have a place to stay in Brussels? Do you think it could host few more Edgeryders? Couch surfing and Airbnb will probably be your best friend, otherwise we'll try to find a cheap accommodation in Youth hostels. Let us know as soon as possible!\n\n<strong>What are your ideas?</strong>\n\nEdgeryders is a chance to express what's been going on in your mind lately. Is there something in particular you want to discuss? Anything interesting you've been working on lately and want to share with us? Let us know, we'll organize something!\n\nI have put up a <a title=\"Google Spreadsheet\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHRpR0w5YVlJWGdJRzF2Qk1hY1UxUmc6MQ\" target=\"_blank\">Google Spreadsheet</a> document where you can fill in your contact information.

If you want to raise awareness\u00a0and draw\u00a0more engagement into it, you may want to consider making use of the twitter storm we discussed during yesterday's\u00a0community call for focusing participants attention on fleshing out the program (check next summary of the community call for more info).\n\nRe: the visual\u00a0documentation, maybe ping [Sam Muirhead] who is running this <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/video-documentation-and-upskilling-at-lote\">session on video documentation</a>?\u00a0\n\nAfter a week in South Africa of preparing the Edgeryders presentation to would be clients with Arthur's help, gathering their feedback and then iterating the presentations I have come to some conclusions. These apply for me, others will have different interpretations:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Edgeryders is at it's core a platform for enabling collaboration on a massive scale around alternative responses to\u00a0systemic crises : ecological, economic and political (without focusing on ontology).\u00a0It does so on three levels:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Connecting people experimenting with solutions with their peers in other places.\u00a0Basic level collaboration is sharing of experiences, knowledge and advice</li>\n\n<li>Enabling hands on, place-based\u00a0collaboration between people with hands on skills from experimenting with solutions and those with detailed knowledge of the issues at hand through unMonastery residencies. More intensive\u00a0collaboration through people moving from one part of world to another where they work in teams with people from the areas which recieve them.</li>\n\n<li>Many people sharing many experiences of problems and solutions = patterns begin to emerge. Third level collaboration is collective intelligence about alternative responses to systemic crises, grounded in hands on experience. This can then be used by community members for purposes of interacting with power and resources on basis of hard evidence and scientific rigour, but also as a means to become better at what we do together.</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>Edgeryders is a do-ocracy: the rules of engagement are designed to enable people to collaborate in free-forming\u00a0constellations and self-organising swarms, not build consensus about what needs doing before people can act. We have no idea how to fix the big issues, so we need many many experiments happening in parallel and knowledge flowing between them.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>There is a core of people that have more central positions in the network\u00a0by virtue of having done hands on community buiding and\u00a0management for the most amount of time. Or\u00a0because they\u00a0craft thoughful\u00a0posts and comments that contribute\u00a0interesting/useful \u00a0information or\u00a0knowledge that\u00a0<span>resonate</span><span>\u00a0with other community members. And because they are\u00a0active in promoting their posts on social media.</span>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nDon't know if this helps.\n\n<span>\u200b</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-05 06:13:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:34.568111", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 531, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3085, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3052, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/3bTqWsVqyzE?rel=0\n\nThe first iteration of the unMonastery is not yet over, and already it has produced highly valuable knowledge. I submit we are ready to have a first stab at an unMonastic Rule, a modern equivalent of the document that scaffolded the rise of the Benedictine movement since Benedict himself.\n\nI have been thinking long and hard about this. I am supposed to be a policy expert, but I cannot anymore bring myself to underwrite the accepted notion of what policy is. The 20th century idea of a powerful machine, armed with scientific knowledge and driving society and its economy to some global optimum on behalf of the people seems to me fundamentally flawed. The only way forward I see is policy as local interaction rules. I mean here the word \"local\" in two senses: one, that they tell you how to interact with your (network) neighbours, not with the global system; and two, that they are locally agreed upon and enforced. Complexity science has taught us how interesting global patterns can emerge from the \"right\" kind of local interactions. Local interaction rules expand by natural selection: a constellation of individuals who happen to be endowed with a \"good\" set of rules will prosper and grow, at the expense of groups that don't. This, I believe, is exactly what powered the rise of the Benedictines: at the time of Benedict, monasticism was already all the rage, and the most influential figure was that of Saint Anthony, an Egyptian anchorite and hermit. But Benedictines had the Rule, and Anthony's followers did not. System dynamics did the rest.\n\nIf the unMonastery is to continue and prosper, working on its version of the Rule is clearly a good idea. Initially we codenamed this idea \"unRule\", but I don't like the associations. In Stephenson's brilliant <em>Anathem</em> he calls it the Discipline, and that's better. But I propose to call it <strong>Protocol</strong>, to recall the notion we have been working with that the Rule itself is a protocol in the software sense of an algorithm that does not serve a specific purpose, but regulates the low-level interaction of pieces of code that can serve a great many purposes. As all interesting artefacts, Protocol should have three conflicting purposes: <strong>encourage free, independent thinking and action for good</strong>; <strong>enable unMonasterians to coordinate and deploy each other quickly as opportunities arise</strong>; <strong>evolve and adapt (but not too quickly)</strong>. Who Does The Work Calls The Shots, for example, is there to encourage free and independent thinking, but \u2013 as people have noted over the months \u2013 does not take care of the coordination issue. This tells you there is a minimum viable size for Protocol, and it is greater than just one rule.\n\nTo <em>write</em> a Protocol 1.0, I propose the following program.\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Study the Rule. I have read it a couple of times, but I feel the need to study more in depth.</li>\n\n<li>Study models of evolution of cooperation we know from complexity science. I am particularly fascinated by the simple algorithms dreamed up by Craig Reynolds and others in the 1980s to produce <a href=\"http://youtu.be/3bTqWsVqyzE\">lifelike flocking behaviour</a> with just three rules (collision avoidance, velocity matching, aiming for the local centre of mass, in this order). We can also draw on Steven Strogatz's and related work on syncing, and even Axelrod's famous tournaments \u2013 tit-for-tat is a two-lines protocol for winning the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma tournament!</li>\n\n<li>Draw on methods from computational biology to simulate society-level consequences of adopting different local-level rules. I recently came across <a href=\"http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003618\">this paper</a> and it knocked me off my feet: it is a totally accessible (which does not mean easy) method to think rigorously about this stuff. You can probably model some of the effects with NetLogo.</li>\n\n<li>(As always) Release early and often, and iterate.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nTo <em>deploy</em> Protocol, I propose the following program:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Test it on iterations of the unMonastery, making its acceptance conditional to admittance. I don't think this qualifies as abuse of power: people would simply be asked to be a part of a social experiment. They would find themselves doing things that they would not otherwise have done for a little while, but that's supposedly the whole point of joining an unMonastery. In passing, note that Benedict wrote \"test\" periods into the Rule, with novices serving two test periods before they were allowed to make a permanent choice to become monks.</li>\n\n<li>Encode it in technology as much as possible \u2013 knowing that it will never be possible for tech to do all, or even most, of the heavy lifting. At the very least, technology-mediated interactions should have the right affordances (not prevent good things to happen). Here I use \"technology\" in a generalized sense: a large kitchen is technology \u2013 it is in fact ICT, because it provides a communication infrastructure.</li>\n\n<li>Devise ways to monitor for what works and what does not in Protocol. It could be as simple as surveying unMonasterians and members of the local community: for Edgeryders, online ethnographies are a natural way to do this.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIn the spirit of Who Does The Work Calls The Shots I would like to spend a little time in unMonastery Matera myself in July, maybe a week or two. I would spend most of the time on other stuff (including unMonastery-related stuff), but simply by being there I would collect valuable data. I commit to humility and look forward to accepting the humblest duties. I would also support my stay, probably with an in-kind donation.

In doing this I am not seeking some exact higher truth. I do feel that facing together in generally the same direction is valuable and is worth making some kind of effort.\n\nEdgeRyders can take on many shapes and meanings in the hearts and minds of many people. Yet I am seeing a recurring underlying theme that comes up time and again and I'd like to call it out in words:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\"The purpose of EdgeRyders is to build bridges between the edge and mainstream societies.\"\n\n</blockquote>\n\nTo me, everything seems to revolve around that.\n\nI have been and will continue to live on my edge regardless of EdgeRyders. Living on the edge means I have in some ways chosen to step back from mainstream society. This makes it difficult for my discoviers to find their way back. I have very little need, motivation or skills to reach back and share my discoveries with mainstream society.\n\nI have very little interest and faith in \"online communities\" because they are a mediocre means for people to connect. The Edge, for me, is not about mediocrity, it is about an almost obsessive draw to quality. I would like to have more connection with people but I do not seek or expect that to happen online.\n\nMy initial online experience of EdgeRyders (reinforced by being physically present at Lote3) is that for me EdgeRyders is a great place to go and meet/connect with other people but not a place I'd choose to hang around and be at / work in. Technically speaking there are better (and specialized) online places/services to go to to actually get work done (and it is unreasonable to expect the EdgeRyders platform to become all those things).\n\nEdgeRyders has very little to offer me as an EdgeRyder amongst other EdgeRyders. It has worlds to offer me as an EdgeRyder living away from mainstream society. I am excited at and moved (all the way to Matera, Italy) by the thought that there may be people out there who can both see and appreciate me for who I am AND represent me and my work to mainstream society AND carry value BOTH WAYS (ie: not only being appreciated but getting paid for what I do ... woah!).\n\nThe name EdgeRyders can be, and has been for me confusing. EdgeRyders (as an online and offline platform) is NOT as the name implies at the edge but in the space between. Though its individual members may indeed be people who live on the edge, the online/offline gathering, I believe, is not, can not be and should not pretend to be at the edge (I have much more to say about this and hope to do so in another context).\n\nThe unique offering EdgeRyders brings to the surface is its bridging capacities. I offer that here as a core purpose/objective for future design efforts. A good design, in this context, would be one that helps us to build bridges.\n\nWhat say you?

In this report we detail an initial analysis of the network that evolved around the online \u2018EdgeRyders\u2019 platform, and discuss what our findings suggest for the platform and for the proper development of networks-aware public policy.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>1. Introduction: A note on networks.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>Networks are not a thing, they are a way of understanding and representing the world. A social networks perspective seeks to understand the way in which discrete units \u2013 nodes \u2013 are connected and affected by the relationships between them. In </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> our nodes are people and their outputs: individual edgeryders and their mission reports. The relationships that we measured and represented are the online discussions that originated around the mission reports. Thus the networks we highlighted are networks of shared interest and inquiry.</span>\n\n \n\n \n\n<span>1.1 Networked Ryders?</span>\n\n \n\n<span>EdgeRyders</span><span> is unique in being an online platform in which individuals speak from personal experience to a dual audience of peers and policy makers. The networks we analysed arise in the conversations around these individual experiences, via the process of writing a mission report - a personal account of ideas, experience or knowledge - grouped under specific campaigns. Each personal account expressed on the platform aspires to be useful to other users and peers; </span><span>whilst overall the platform seeks to render ideas</span><span>, experience and projects in such a way as to make them accessible to policy makers.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>We sought to understand who was using the</span><span> EdgeRyders</span><span> platform, the ways in which they were connected to each other, the ways in which these connections evolved and came about, and what this means for the proper evolution of the </span><span>Edgeryders</span><span> project. </span><span>Beyond analysing and visualising the </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> networks that we had access to, our enquiry was structured around three main questions</span>\n\n<span>        </span>\n\n<ol class=\"c15\" start=\"1\"><li><span>        </span><span>What should the structure of a crowd-sourced think tank be?</span></li></ol><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> </span><span>is a platform unlike any other, although it mimics and seeks to achieve similar objectives to traditional think tanks; by informing policy. Its vastly distributed, open access and participatory approach means that applying pre-existing organisational structures is neither logical nor practical. By analysing the current structure of the network, we have focused on what an ideal organisational structure could be.</span>\n\n \n\n<ol class=\"c15\" start=\"1\"><li><span>        </span><span>Can network analysis be used to help the growth of the network, and if so, how? </span><span>        </span></li></ol><span>Individual edgeryders have repeatedly expressed a desire - both during the conference and in comment threads online - for the platform to i) play a greater role in connecting individuals for the purposes of collaboration and ii) establish higher visibility for the activities of EdgeRyder members and the platform itself. We believe that network analysis can play a critical role in both supporting the development of networks and in functioning as a realtime guide to them. This is further discussed in our recommendations.</span>\n\n<span>        </span>\n\n<ol class=\"c15\" start=\"1\"><li><span>        </span><span>How does </span><span>EdgeRyders </span><span>fit into the concept of opendata and open democracy? </span><span>        </span></li></ol> \n\n<span>EdgeRyder members have frequently signalled desires for opendata, greater transparency and open participation in the way processes of governance are structured. Whilst publicly available, the data analysed in this report is by no means \u2018open\u2019: in its aggregate form it is only currently available to the research team. We address this in our recommendations, focusing on how this data may be made available in a useful way to others; whilst questioning what open network analysis could become in this context. </span>\n\n \n\n \n\n<span>2 </span><span>Methodology</span>\n\n \n\n<span>We used a combination of network analysis and qualitative methodologies. We analysed written content on the platform and used open-ended interviews and ethnographic research before and during the </span><span>EdgeRyders </span><span>conference to understand the motivations behind usage of the platform and the project more generally.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>At the time of the main body analysis - early June 2012 - 80% of registered users were inactive. As such, our network analysis details the communication between the 20% of users who were active. We used a combination of data that was extracted directly from the </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> website, and manual data collection.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>That which could be directly extracted from the platform at the time of analysis included a list of all users, directional interactions between users, the amount of interaction between individuals and the frequency of interaction between users and specific mission reports. Whereas extracted data was complete, the additional attribute data that was manually collected from the website was only present where users elected to give us such information. As such, information about gender, locality and totem-animal preference# is incomplete. The networks have been analysed at four time-points. These have been used to illustrate structural evolution of trends in each instance.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>On the whole, we used open-source software for our analysis including: Open Office Calc (free to use open-source Excel equivalent) for cleaning datasets and Gephi (free to use open-source network analysis tool) to analyse and visualise the data provided.</span>\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n<span>3. </span><span>The </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> Social Network</span>\n\n<span>In this section we analyse: the overall structure of the EdgeRyders network, the way in which this structure evolved over time, factors that affect the network structure, and social networks external to the EdgeRyders platform. </span>\n\n \n\n<span>Key Findings</span>\n\n \n\n<span>- Beware the lurkers: as of the 4th June 2012 the network comprised 913 users, of which 194 were actively participating by posting reports and commenting on other user reports, whilst 719 remained observers</span>\n\n<span>- 60% of users are male and 40% are female (*where given)</span>\n\n<span>- </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> come from 20 different countries (*where given)</span>\n\n<span>- The \u2018top\u2019 three countries are: UK, Italy and France (*where given)</span>\n\n<span>- Edgeryders who live in </span><span>multiple cities throughout Europe</span><span> outnumber those who claim to reside in a single city </span>\n\n<span>- </span><span>The network shows signs of moving from being community manager-led to being community-member led.</span><span> </span>\n\n \n\n<img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/7/782a8a3f794e63887ebc7695030a7e6743920025.jpg' width=\"70%\">\n\n<img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/9/99e3e4b79087d1c5cbd261673a94efbb0e9e6916.jpg' width=\"70%\">\n\n \n\n<span>There are many ways to understand what a network </span><span>should look like, </span><span>all of which are contested. For the purposes of this analysis, we will be utilising the following concepts: i) Network Weaving and the four stages of community networks (Krebs and Holley); ii) the way in which information travels through bridges; iii) the action-spurring effects of dense networks and the ways these lead to the reinforcement of social norms </span><span>(for ii) and iii) see </span><span><a class=\"c0\" href=\"http://jaylee.business.ku.edu/MGMT%20916/PDF/The%20Network%20Structure%20of%20Social%20Capital.pdf.\">R.Burt, 2000 </a></span><span> </span><span>For iii) note that since Durkheim, it has been held that dense networks lead to less social norm violations. Coleman (1990) is the most cited contemporary thinker to have proved this. There is a nice discussion by Port\u00e9s in Port\u00e9s, A, 1998</span><span>, SOCIAL CAPITAL: Its Origins and Applications in Modern Sociology, Annual Review of Sociology. 24:1\u201324. </span><span><a class=\"c0\" href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.1\">Online</a></span><span>. [Accessed May 2012].</span>\n\n \n\n \n\n<span>One way of understanding the development of community networks is to so see their evolution in terms of going from scattered fragments, through to a hub-spoke shape into core periphery models (</span><span>for offline networks see </span><span><a class=\"c0\" href=\"http://www.orgnet.com/BuildingNetworks.pdf\">Krebs and Holley, 2006</a></span><span>). What we suggest is that an effective network that covers many communities of interests and wide ranging geographical communities should have an overall core periphery structure, that can be shown to be composed of many small core periphery communities.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>This vision of interconnecting core-periphery structures is one that could be a natural progression of how </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> has developed so far. To start with </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> was a series of scattered fragments with community managers who acted as hubs: the community managers were charged with weaving connections and the invitation of users with specific communities of interest meant that groupings emerged from the offset. With the progression of the project the structure become very core periphery, with highly connected community managers acting as the core of the network, and in the run-up to the Conference the structure became more complex, with far more inter-community member interaction. The question now is: what next? </span>\n\n \n\n<span>Some quick network concepts:</span>\n\n<span>Hub-Spoke </span><span>is a network formation that visually resembles a chariot wheel, the hub acting as a centralised node that connects with a series of other nodes by spokes or ties; within the </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> network this is easily recognised with Mission Reports as the hub node and those commenting acting as the spoke nodes.</span>\n\n<span>(See </span><span><a class=\"c0\" href=\"http://www.orgnet.com/BuildingNetworks.pdf\">Krebs and Holley 200</a></span><span>)</span>\n\n \n\n \n\n<span>Core-Periphery</span><span> </span><span>is a simplified way of understanding to the extent to which a social network is centralised or decentralized. A network with high core-periphery will have a greater number of clustered communities located at the edges of the core network, referred to in this report as sub-communities.</span>\n\n \n\n \n\n<span>B</span><span>ridges</span><span> </span><span>are a type of social tie that connects two different groups in a social network, that may not otherwise be connected. In the EdgeRyder\u2019s networks that we have analysed both Mission Reports and Individuals that could be seen as being network bridges.</span>\n\n<span>(See </span><span><a class=\"c0\" href=\"http://jaylee.business.ku.edu/MGMT%20916/PDF/The%20Network%20Structure%20of%20Social%20Capital.pdf\">R. Burt 2000</a></span><span>)</span>\n\n \n\n \n\n<span>Density </span><span>can be read in the </span><span>number of relationships or ties between nodes in proportion to the number of theoretically-possible relations or ties. Dense networks have significantly higher direct ties between all members.</span>\n\n<span>(See discussion in </span><span><a class=\"c0\" href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.1\">Portes 1998</a></span><span>)</span>\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n<span>3.1 What does the network look like?</span>\n\n \n\n<a href=\"1_http://www.immateriallabour.com/ER-REPORT/large/wholenet-eyeofEU.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5b12b0e92a848364337b99d291f161dbe8c471de.jpg' width=\"70%\"></a>\n\n \n\n<span>Above is a birdseye view of the whole of the </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> community. With 913 registered users as of the 4th June 2012, the 194 active participants are shown clustered densely in the center, as indicated in blue; the inactive users are shown circulating the perimeter of the network, as indicated in yellow.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>In our analysis we analysed two types of networks: edgeryder-to-edgeryder networks and edgeryder-to-post networks:</span>\n\n<span>Ederyder-to-edgeryder networks: </span><span>that network which emerges when you take account of comments between </span><span>EdgeRyder </span><span>members on the same mission report. If edgeryder Ann comments on edgeryder Bob\u2019s mission report, then a directed tie is created from Ann to Bob. If Bob responds to Ann's comment, a tie is created from Bob to Ann. </span>\n\n<span>Edgeryder-to-post network</span><span>: that network which arises when you take account of which edgeryder commented on which report. In the above example, a tie is created between Ann and Bob's report 'of mice and edgeryders'; and between Bob and Bob's report 'of mice and edgeryders'.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>Analysing edgeryder to edgeryder networks</span>\n\n<span>Before the conference, the </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> network seemed dominated by </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> staff, although with clear indications that certain community members were beginning to take on a community weaving role. They were not changing the overall shape of the network, but communication between community members was clearly intensifying rapidly. </span>\n\n \n\n<span>To start understanding the shape of the overall network, we looked at its various stages of evolution at different time-points, detected those nodes with the most connections, did research to understand why the nodes were so connected, visualised the overall network using a force atlas algorithm and used modularity to start detecting sub-communities. These two algorithms work in tandem: force-atlas places the nodes in the sociogram as a function of who they are connected to, and modularity</span><span> </span><span>can be used to understand how strongly a network divides into \u2018modules\u2019: groups, clusters or sub-communities. </span>\n\n \n\n<span>Using various iterations of modularity measures, we </span><span>identified the emergence of 7 weakly bound sub-communities in which the key nodes - the individuals central to each of these sub-communities - were </span><span>E</span><span>dgeRyder</span><span>s</span><span> staff who were tasked with the role of community managers: Alberto, Hexayurt, Nadia, Chara, Lyne, Noemi and Albertomz. We found that these individuals accounted for the majority of comments left on the platform, but that there was evidence that their role was in flux, with new non-community manager nodes emerging as weavers. Indeed, in the last time-slice we analysed it seemed clear that the community was diversifying into further sub-groupings that went beyond the paid community managers.</span>\n\n \n\n<a href=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/ER-REPORT/large/structure_4_MOD_NL.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c49e21a36e973cf746671da9e7de6529d7a11d51.jpg' width=\"70%\"></a>\n\n \n\n<span>Mission Report Network</span>\n\n<span>The analysis of the ties between EdgeRyder members and specific mission reports were less centralised and less reliant on </span><span>EdgeRyders </span><span>staff, showing that frequency of interaction between users doesn\u2019t directly correlate with the formation of sub-communities of shared inquiry.

Page view numbers seem to show that reports circulated through mediums external to </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> receive a greater audience than would be possible solely within </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span>. </span>\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n<span>Evolution</span>\n\n \n\n<span>In order to understand how the network has evolved from its inception up until June 2012, the database has been extracted on 4 separate occasions. The time-slices are dated early February 2012, early April 2012, late April 2012, and early June 2012.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>To date, the community has grown through a snowball effect: growth happens when community members and managers invite their friends, contacts and communities of interest to join. At this stage in the analysis, it appears that we can talk about one and a half \u2018snowball waves\u2019, and about the effect of different communities of interest having been invited onto the platform. For example some of the earliest </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> were John F Moore, founder of the open government organisation \u2018The Lab\u2019, and other open government proponents. By the last time slice we analysed, we start to see that the primary driving force in the growth of the platform is through recommendations to friends to join- the network starts to look like it\u2019s on its way from hub-spoke to core-periphery! </span>\n\n \n\n<span>The emphasis on peer-to-peer invitations is a potentially positive way of fomenting the formation of networks: if individuals continue to invite those they are already connected with, it will ensure pre-existing networks and conversations are brought online, which benefits the platform. However, to avoid the </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> platform exacerbating existing cliques - or filter bubbles - this form of network growth requires a greater focus on diverse network weaving by community managers and/or the introduction of new functionality</span><span>.</span>\n\n \n\n<a href=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/ER-REPORT/large/7_structure_1_evolution.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e7cef437c3483194770aa0859f37ea5d43edab17.jpg' width=\"70%\"></a>\n\n<span>The nodes for time-slice</span><span> 1 are indicated in blue - extracted February 2012 </span>\n\n \n\n<a href=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/ER-REPORT/large/8_structure_2_evolution.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f04ea7a0d6e8ece0d2dcefd6e0c3a511308dc096.jpg' width=\"70%\"></a>\n\n<span>The nodes for time-slice 2 are indicated in orange </span><span>- extracted beginning April 2012</span>\n\n \n\n<a href=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/ER-REPORT/large/9_structure_3_evolution.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ecc1e9fb3d247db197c4b93a4e5ef844b848d00b.jpg' width=\"70%\"></a>\n\n<span>The nodes for time-slice 3 are indicated in aqua blue </span><span>- extracted end April 2012</span>\n\n \n\n<a href=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/ER-REPORT/large/10_structure_4_evolution.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7d9961c27ab39917b0d6ce0f7fd198bff13c5064.jpg' width=\"70%\"></a>\n\n<span>The nodes for time-slice 4 are indicated in black </span><span>- extracted beginning June 2012</span>\n\n \n\n<span>What affects structure?</span>\n\n \n\n<span>1.

It is logical that those employed by the Council of Europe have been most active so far in the network, since there is an obligation to commit a more substantial amount of time. We have also examined how community managers have been encouraged to engage with EdgeRyder members to ensure continued interaction and aggregation of content.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>This type of community management - understood here as an example of network weaving - has increased the density of the network; it has been common practice for community managers to connect users with shared interests and overlapping lines of enquiry. The success of those community managers in forging new connections is shown by how community-member-only networks become exponentially more dense over time, with less of a reliance on the initial network hub/core of community managers. This can be substantiated and better illustrated by removing community managers from the network and comparing time-slices 3 and 4. </span>\n\n \n\n<a href=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/ER-REPORT/large/structure_NEWMod_nopaid_4.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/1/12abfcf24b917ce38d348517fe6ad584e9b29ff5.jpg' width=\"70%\"></a>\n\n \n\n<span>The way in which individuals\u2019 characteristics affect the network</span>\n\n<span>Where given the gender-balance on</span><span> EdgeRyders </span><span>was</span><span> 40%</span><span> women and 60% men, with 4 organisations redacted. In these visualisations women are pink, men are blue.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>Communication between the sexes in the initial phase of the platform, as shown in time slices 1 and 2, was found to be disproportionately restricted to same sex dialogue. This is indicated in the visualisations by the width of ties; which are sized according to EdgeWeight - number of comments-; the directional flow is illustrated by arrows. </span>\n\n \n\n<a href=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/ER-REPORT/large/11_gender_1_arrow.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/9/905c04cb82d18ced59bfb4ace0df800d13e0bd3e.jpg' width=\"70%\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/ER-REPORT/large/12_gender_2_arrow.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/a/af52a140eac5905acbdafe3e8876c91b307d1c36.jpg' width=\"70%\"></a>\n\n \n\n<span>When we get to time slice 3 this negative trend has begun to correct itself, with time slice 4 we see that a healthy balance of intergendered interaction has emerged throughout the network. We also found that, on average, women have written on a wider range of mission reports than men.</span>\n\n \n\n<a href=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/ER-REPORT/large/13_gender_3_arrow.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aed89ee3a419ad0be45e05ad16493615d58d06de.jpg' width=\"70%\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/ER-REPORT/large/Gender_4_arrows_NL.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/7/71d08342343e5ea5c06de8d115730528c9a11c92.jpg' width=\"70%\"></a>\n\n<span>Beyond the Platform</span>\n\n \n\n<span>EdgeRyder members are not just connected on the </span><span>EdgeRyders </span><span>platform: it is clear that communication outside of the website is playing a pivotal role in influencing the structure and growth of the community. No one has yet analysed the full effect of the \\#LOTE conference but inevitably the acceleration of face to face interaction has increased online and offline activity.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>Online</span>\n\n \n\n<span>Twitter:</span><span> </span><span>has played a major role in communication between users. This is not all that surprising given the type of individual likely to be attracted to a networked online platform such as </span><span>Edgeryders</span><span>, but the enduring nature of the conversations on twitter are worthy of note. The hashtags \\#LOTE and \\#EDGECAMP were used to facilitate fast moving conversation during the</span><span> EdgeRyders</span><span> conference and unconference. The conversations around these hashtags led to new twitter relationships between </span><span>EdgeRyders members</span><span> and between </span><span>EdgeRyder members</span><span> and non-</span><span>EdgeRyder members</span><span>. The discussions started during the conference are still active, albeit with a more reduced following, and are being used in some instances to build up to offline post-conference meet-ups. </span>\n\n \n\n<span>Facebook: </span><span>doesn\u2019t seem to have played such a significant role as Twitter. The lack of visible connections could be in part due to the privacy settings inherent in Facebook\u2019s interface. We have however observed the creation of Facebook groups for discussion and this is likely to lead to a greater number of connections being made.</span>\n\n \n\n \n\n<span>Offline</span>\n\n \n\n<span>Pre-existing Networks: </span><span>i</span><span>n the comments thread of our initial report and in conversation with </span><span>edgeryders</span><span> we asked the question </span><span>Who did you already know on EdgeRyders before joining the platform?</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>Who from your pre-existing networks have you invited to join the platform?. </span><span>Without clear quantitative data it is difficult to establish the exact impact of these offline networks on the platform, but the snowball effect indicated in the evolving structure of the network would indicate that this is playing a fundamental role in its development.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>Future network analysis of the community should seek to better understand the relationship between online and offline networks, to ensure a full picture of the networks growth.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>Meetups: </span><span>breakout sessions staged at EdgeCamp led to the creation of Europe wide group meetups, operated through meetup.com, in a number of capital cities. The intention is to use these offline meetings to carry forward the momentum generated during the conference.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>We have put together a series of visualisations to illustrate these new clusters \u2013 as a first step towards understanding the relationship between online/offline networks and the convergence of the two.</span>\n\n \n\n<a href=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/ER-REPORT/large/meetups.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"70%\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cba97c8f3eb9d3a7f4493c24d7cc48a9c53ca861.jpg' width=\"70%\"></a>\n\n \n\n<span>These developments could mark a significant shift for the network: from a knowledge discovery exercise, in which users express their personal experiences on the platform in relative isolation to a knowledge creation exercise in which users increasingly meet on and offline to work together.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>At what point does the </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> community network end and other online and offline networks begin</span><span>? As </span><span>activity increasingly takes place away from the website - on Twitter, Meetups and Facebook - it\u2019s important to take a decision about how these networks should be analysed, or if they should in fact be analysed at all. </span><span>Autonomy has been an important theme throughout EdgeRyder\u2019s mission reports, and any attempt to analyse, collate or extract this data should be highly sensitive to these values. </span>\n\n \n\n<span>Conclusion</span>\n\n<span>What should the structure of a crowd-sourced think tank be? </span><span>The platform is currently displaying emergent structural trends that could indicate healthy growth. However, it is essential that we return to the question of the ideal structure for what is ostensibly a crowdsourcing research exercise, </span>\n\n \n\n<span>The trend towards a denser and more diverse core-periphery structure would suggest that the network is becoming more resilient and will become less reliant on community managers. If the network continues to grow in this way, a fundamental question of sustainability should be asked; current functionality is limited in not giving enough visibility and navigation for users to easily establish their own relationships with other users - connections and awareness are generated primarily through community managers. This is a problem: if </span><span>EdgeRyders </span><span>were to experience a sudden spike in its user base, the infrastructure for managing the community would fall over - both in terms of technical functionality and in community management strategies. </span>\n\n \n\n<span>This signals the need for a critical decision to be taken in supporting the continued growth of the platform, with two routes that can be adopted, exclusively or in parallel, with divergent effects, those are; the introduction of new functionality that allows users to better find and make connections themselves, thus further decentralising the network through a self generative effect, or alternatively the introduction of more community managers tasked explicitly with the role of network weaving and supporting the formation of sub-communities, leading to a distributed but organisationally centralised network.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>The network analysis conducted here should be used to support and inform any allocation of resources in either one of these directions; going forward, continued analysis will be required to ensure maximised use value for the content generated. To this end we suggest the adoption of a monthly cycle of data extraction with continued public analysis.</span>\n\n \n\n \n\n<span><strong>Recommendations</strong></span><strong><span>   </span></strong><span>     </span>\n\n<ol class=\"c15\" start=\"1\"><li><span>        </span><span>Teach EdgeRyders to Network Weave</span></li></ol><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> already has an organisational structure in place that would allow individual community managers to be taught basic network analysis and techniques for effective network weaving. We suggest this should be taken one step further, having identified the emergence of network hubs external to those currently employed; we recommend these individuals be equipped with the skills and mandate to take a network weaving role within their respective community. This could be executed most effectively if focused on specific topics or campaigns.</span>\n\n<span>        </span>\n\n<ol class=\"c15\" start=\"1\"><li><span>        </span><span>Analyse other online and offline networks</span></li></ol><span>It is clear from our analysis that an increasing amount of activity is taking place offline and on alternative networks. In order to better understand these developments it is clear that a structured methodology should be employed to analyse the structure of these networks and their relationship to the platform itself. In the interest of views expressed by</span><span> </span><span>EdgeRyders </span><span>members </span><span>this approach should be discussed and developed publicly with the community</span>\n\n<span>        </span>\n\n<ol class=\"c15\" start=\"1\"><li><span>        </span><span>Monthly         Data Extraction and Public Network Analysis</span></li></ol><span>Currently the extraction and analysis conducted has happened primarily for the benefit of the Transition Handbook, for the next phase of </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> we believe it is important to implement a structured approach to organising and presenting what is found. This could be best achieved with an ongoing public routine on the platform that allows the community to participate and understand the analysis conducted.</span>\n\n<span>        </span>\n\n<ol class=\"c15\" start=\"1\"><li><span>        </span><span>Promote the platform as a </span><span>successful </span><span>model for Open Democracy</span></li></ol><span>EdgerRyders has shown that very high-level and real communication is possible on an online platform that links citizens to institutions. This has clear ramifications for for open government; and for moves to support accountability and transparency at all levels. What would a UK parliament version of </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> look like; connecting young people to Whitehall through Blackberry messenger and an IPhone app? What would a hyperlocal </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> look like?</span>\n\n \n\n<span>Platform Functionality Recommendations</span>\n\n<span>        </span>\n\n<ol class=\"c15\" start=\"1\"><li><span>        </span><span>Introduce a user tagging system</span></li></ol><span>Currently there is a severe lack of functionality on the platform for edgeryders to use to make connections between users. The first solution to this is to introduce a tagging system that alerts individuals when they\u2019ve been mentioned in conversation. Facebook uses similar functionality to allow for high visibility and comment relevant connections between users.</span>\n\n \n\n<span>With this in mind the landing page for logged in users should be focused on the way in which others are interacting with you. </span><span>        </span>\n\n<ol class=\"c15\" start=\"1\"><li><span>        </span><span>Embed and Integrate other networks into the platform</span></li></ol><span>In the </span><span>Beyond the Platform </span><span>section of this report we highlighted a selection of other networks that the community are using to communicate and collaborate. These include; Twitter, Facebook, Meetup, Google Docs, Google Groups, Pirate Pad, Status.in; the majority of these platforms provide open API and embedding ability. To support and make visible to all users in the </span><span>EdgeRyders</span><span> community, these tools should be made part of the overall information infrastructure of the platform. </span>\n\n<span>        </span>\n\n<ol class=\"c15\" start=\"1\"><li><span>        </span><span>Introduce mandatory attribute data fields </span><span>        </span></li></ol><span>Our analysis has been restricted by a lack of data concerning locality, gender, age and other attribute data. In order resolve this we suggest that required registration fields be implemented, with preset options; to ensure consistency in the data. This functionality should come with the explicit ability to opt out, as there are many on the platform that may not wish to share this information with the Council of Europe. The inclusion of these fields should come with a clear explanation as to why they are being asked for this information and what it will be used for. It should be highlighted that it is in the interest of community for creating a directory for collaboration and to be included in geographically relevant groups and events.</span>", "created_at": "2012-07-13 00:10:28", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 06:09:36.198561", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5880, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 102.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1087, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1054, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h1>About this document</h1>\n\n<em>This is a wrapup of the organization subsession in the Policy Hero Challenge in \\#LOTE2. Facilitators: Philippe Verstichel and Kat Borlongan. Policy makers-in-residence: Prabhat Agarwal, Fabrizio Sestini, Rory Smith at European Commission DG Connect. Thanks to Prabhat Agarwal for helpful comments and edits. </em>\n\nThe parent session from which this sprung up was the \u201cRewiring Innovation Policy\u201d. The original question was: what would innovation policy aimed at supporting innovative networked individuals, rather than organizations, look like? In the course of the session, Edgeryders itself has been used repeatedly as an example of a network of innovative (to variable degrees) individuals. One hypothesis, confirmed by the early discussion, was that public support needs an organizational shell, for accountability reasons. Our sub-session looks at what organizational form might Edgeryders take to best support the innovative individuals participating in the network. Lessons were learned along the way.\n\n<h1>What the terrain looks like</h1>\n\n<h2>CONTEXT</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>About 95% of public financial resources spent on innovation are spent at the national level. The EC is an important player, but by no means the only one.</li>\n\n<li>The EC is a public body subject to pretty strict accountability rules: every cent that is spent needs to be traceable. In this respect it is a defensive organization. It has several oversight mechanism breathing down its back; therefore \u201cit is in the paper trail business to avoid being shot down\u201d. In fact, most bureaucracies are defensive to some degree.</li>\n\n<li>When you think about what you want to achieve consider <em>output, outcome, impact</em>. Suppose your project is to buy a 3D printer, use it to develop some great new product, and sell it on the market. Output is that you actually bought the machine, and you have an invoice to show for it; outcome is that you did develop some product; impact is that the product was actually great, and led to your company successfully taking off. Most oversight is at the output level, which is the easiest to check for. On impact \u2013 which is really what the policy is trying to buy in the first place - typically (so-called \u201cex-post\u201d) evaluations are carried out, not accounting checks.</li>\n\n<li>Risk-taking behavior (in the style of venture capital funds, that are designed to support companies that will mostly fail but sometimes win big) needs to be explicitly called for and acknowledged publicly. Pure accounting errors are targeted to fall within a so-called <em>acceptable error rate</em>. For the EC, this rate is typically a few percent. This refers to errors on outputs. Some funding schemes explicitly accept risk in outcomes and impacts, e.g. Future and Emerging Technologies. But even compared to those, Venture Capital investors tend to accept much higher risks on outcomes and impacts, sometimes up to 95%. In other words they are happy that many of their companies fail (though with sound accounts).</li>\n\n<li>As a result of all this, giving public money for strange, inherently risky activities like innovation has a high administrative cost (the administrative cost of procuring standardized goods/services, like toilet paper, is much lower, because given specifications the agency can simply choose the contractor with the best price). This cost is more or less fixed: evaluating and managing a 50K euro proposal costs the same a evaluating a 2 million one. So, public agencies gravitate towards funding the large ones.</li>\n\n<li>These constraints are much less severe for private funding: trusts, foundations, philantropists etc. can give you money on a handshake provided their board of trustees has a hands-off approach.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2>KNOW THY ENEMY</h2>\n\nWhere there is public money up for grabs, there is a risk of fraud. The danger is highest for activities like innovation, in which \u2013 by definition \u2013 you don\u2019t know if what you build is going to work until you have built it. Fraud is discouraged by building a repossession mechanism into the policy: if someone can\u2019t account for money, they are sued and their assets (buildings etc.) can be repossessed.\n\nFraudster are your enemies. They poisoned the well, building a climate of distrust. To interact with funding institutions, you must look different from a fraudster. To the EC, a typical fraudster looks like this:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>recently constituted \u2013 no history</li>\n\n<li>no employees</li>\n\n<li>no capital or minimal capital</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIn other words, exactly like Edgeryders and other networks of peers. If you are a network and you want to interact with institutions, you have to signal that you are different. Given that interaction happens through bureaucratic procedures \u2013 you can\u2019t go have a beer with the EC and show them what a cool person you are \u2013 that can be difficult.\n\n<h2>DISTRIBUTED AUTHORITY IN ORGANIZATIONS: TWO EXAMPLES</h2>\n\nSome networks have managed to style themselves as \u201cdistributed authority organizations\u201d. Two examples that might be worth investigating:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>the Open Knowledge Foundation. Great interface with the EC.</li>\n\n<li>the Pirate Party. That\u2019s more interface with the political space rather than the policy space.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nHypothesis: these are the result of a top-down decision to distribute [Ideas for this section (from PVerstic63) : I think OKF is good at tackling solutions whereas Piraty Party is good at tackling problems - problems space and solution space are two different animals - it looks to me that Edgeryders is neither in problem space nor in solution space, it is rooted in action space with a view to provide tools for the transition to a better future. So, with the buzzwords in mind, it is trying to have a social impact without pretending to have the solution - which is what in my humble opinion social innovation should be about. Hence the question of distributed authority is more a question of leadership rather than power relationships - the OKF in Italy is a typical example of authority by expertise (one individual is a great hacker in GIS). Of course it should not become a technocracy (which is another form of bureaucracy), there is a need for a kind of authority that leaves room for egalitarianism together with diversity.]\n\n<h2>THE DISTRIBUTED LEGITIMACY PROBLEM</h2>\n\nReforming organization in distributed power social contexts has a legitimacy problem. Can Alberto decide that, starting tomorrow, Edgeryders becomes an organization and just register it? Can Nadia, or anyone else? Who gets to be on the board? Who gets to be the figure head, the CEO, the President, the High Priest(ess)? Where do we incorporate it? The question is not technical, but relational: it is plausible that, if anyone makes the move, people will spend the next month discussing it. In a bad scenario, the community might even be destroyed by mutual accusation of appropriation... silly, yes, infantile, yes, but we\u2019ve all seen it before. Mythical founders are typically the right people for the job \u2013 like Jimmy Wales morphing Wikipedia from for-profit to non-profit.\n\n<h1>Possible solutions</h1>\n\n<h2>WITH ZERO FUNDING</h2>\n\nNo, we don\u2019t do an Edgeryders org. ER remains a network of people; its purpose is to empower individual Edgeryders to do their thing. The network does not seek funding: we help each other access funding as needed. The ER network is not costless to run. We can sustain it for a year, by committing to each other the time to keep the online network lively; we can work towards at \\#LOTE3 in 2013 with near-zero funding, as \\#LOTE2 showed. This brings a lot of political capital: we can actually sit down and interact with funding agencies, because we (the network) don\u2019t want anything from them, so everybody can relax and speak the truth. The session with the DG connect people was extremely frank and illuminating for many of us.\n\n<h2>WITH SOME FUNDING</h2>\n\nYes, we are going to seek a small amount of funding. For the first year, we should probably try to raise philantropic money, because the organizational profile of a newborn NGO is too weak for gov or certainly Euro funding. Also, a newly formed NGO can manage 20K, but would disintegrate under the pressure of accounting for 1 million. This requires someone to take charge \u2013 probably with the unconditional support of the more senior and influential members of the community. An alternative funding strategy is to bundle the network conversation with some kind of activity (like the idea of systematizing the emergent pattern of collaboration into some kind of distributed consultancy) and run a Kickstarter campaign.\n\n<h2>ACTIONABLE: PROJECTS INVENTORY</h2>\n\nWhatever the fundraising decision, it makes sense for people to write in the platform what they are working on. This facilitates mutual recruitment: knowing someone is working on something.\n\n<h2>ACTIONABLE: EUROPEAN SOCIAL INNOVATION PRIZE</h2>\n\nIt would make sense to write an application to ESIP. Alberto (one of the judges) will declare conflict of interest and will not vote, but there is the off chance that we\u2019d get 20K no strings attached. Consideration Structure - now Edgeryders is migrating from being a Council of Europe project to something else - there is a greater potential for misunderstandings among the participants. Clarity and some kind of defined structure (social contracts?) is necessary to avoid this.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-04-18 15:54:30", "updated_at": "2017-10-03 12:07:05.291598", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1580, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 16.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10823, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 2261, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Not a mailinglist.</b>\n\nAs great as MailPile is, from my current understanding it is a web-based e-mail client.

We practice a sort of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science\">open notebook science</a>.\u00a0We don't publish only results, but also questions, doubts, within-team disagreements, half-baked ideas. This is made more effective by a specificity of OpenCare:\u00a0the community and the team are in separate \"rooms\" of the same online platform, edgeryders.eu. People who hang around it\u00a0can't help noticing the stream of research project updates. Some of them engage.\u00a0\n\nThis was expected. But I was not expecting the magnitude of the effect. 81 people have contributed at least one comment to the research team space. The team's own numerosity fluctuates, but it's about 20. The others are just people from the community who drop in to ask questions or make suggestions. And they outnumber us three to one.\n\nIn the network diagrams, nodes are color- and size coded by in-degree. You can think of in-degree as a measure of the interest that the person's contribution elicits in the conversation. By this metric, it is clear that self-selected community members who just jump in\u00a0are making a major contribution to the OpenCare research effort. The highest in-degree individuals who are not affiliated with any of the partners are @Federico_Monaco (ranks 7th by in-degree), @Rune (ranks 13th) and @Francesco_Maria_ZAVA (ranks 16th).\u00a0\n\nThe conversation about\u00a0OpenCare as a project (to the right of the picture)\u00a0is of the same order of magnitude as that about open care as a potential pathway to societal well-being (to the left). It needs to be said, however, that the former has a lot of menial content: agreeing about a time and place to meet, requesting administrative information etc. \u00a0\n\nWhat are the consequences of all this activity? More diversity in research. More space for participation. With a bit of luck, more and higher quality scientific output.\u00a0My favourite story is this: a community member, the already mentioned Federico Monaco, has proposed we do a paper together. He had found a call for papers in a journal he follows, and thought it a good fit. His proposal stirred the rest of the team into action. His <a href=\"/t/call-for-papers-political-forms-and-movements-in-the-digital-era-deadline-for-abstract-submission-february-28-2017/6059\">thread</a> received over 50 comments. A\u00a0draft abstract was then uploaded onto <a href=\"/t/abstract-for-political-forms-and-movements-in-the-digital-era-final-feedback-gathering/6103\">a public wiki</a>\u00a0for community scrutiny and feedback.\n\nMany people sent contributions large and small. The large ones (example: that of\u00a0Ezio \u2013 <a href=\"/t/call-for-papers-political-forms-and-movements-in-the-digital-era-deadline-for-abstract-submission-february-28-2017/6059/47\">here</a>) did most of the heavy lifting. But the process had a role also for smaller ones. People like myself, who did not feel confident to step in as co-authors, were able to offer <a href=\"/t/call-for-papers-political-forms-and-movements-in-the-digital-era-deadline-for-abstract-submission-february-28-2017/6059/48\">some small help</a>\u00a0without having to take responsbility for the whole thing. Federico led with a firm but light touch, asking everyone who volunteered any thought what role they wanted to play in the paper. For example, @Yannick \u2013 also\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0a member of the OpenCare team \u2013 was offered co-authorship (but <a href=\"/t/call-for-papers-political-forms-and-movements-in-the-digital-era-deadline-for-abstract-submission-february-28-2017/6059/17\">declined</a>). All of this happened out in the open. As you\u00a0read the whole thread, you can see ideas form through the discussion of the co-authors. Collective intelligence about collective intelligence!\u00a0\n\nInterdisciplinarity happened quite naturally as a result of the open process. The final submission listed five authors: Federico himself (a medical anthropologist); @Ezio_Manzini (a designer for social innovation); @Noemi (a social scientist); @Amelia (an ethnographer); myself (a network scientist). How cool is that?\n\nAnother advantage of doing things this way is increased accountability to the people who take part\u00a0in the main conversation, the one about care. Through the research team forum, they can ask question and make proposals. This should mitigate the perceived risk of researchers taking an exploitative attitude towards people's contributions. The operative word here is \"perceived\". We have the best intentions, but we recognize this is not enough. We are determined to demonstrate them to the community, and transparency goes a long way towards doing it.\u00a0\n\nI think that, together, we are making OpenCare... open. I had never had the luxury of running a research project with such transparency. I like it a lot, and hope to keep doing so in the future. What do others think?\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-02 14:03:29", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 06:30:23.196154", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 877, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 222.8, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3310, 3362, 157, 3, 3880], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32509, "user_id": 3324, "topic_id": 5879, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>yes</b>\n\nhello @LucechiodelliUB\n\nok for today at 2.00 pm!\n\nI'll be there.

Re what you wrote above. I've yet to meet anyone who's worked in commercial comms that doesn't have the same ambivalence towards packaged information. And when you are so used to \"speaking\" it can be very very hard to listen, you're somehow in the role of sending out information...rather than taking it in. Perhaps it is \u00a0a skill one that comes easily for some, for others it has to be learned.\u00a0\n\nRe the nervosity of talking about your own projects. I am no expert but I do ALOT of presentations. My approach is to prepare them in advance, write a script, time myself doing the presentation. Cut it down to about half the length I am allowed, practice again.\n\nAlso for me writing about them is very helpful. Because it forces you to find those sentences, simple and elegant metaphors, for what you want to describe. And this simplicity fosters confidence because you see you are not \"losing\" people. If you're charismatic you can engage people anyway without all the preparation, but it can be really exhausting.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-05 07:39:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:55.538463", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 211, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2580, 2725], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24597, "user_id": 113, "topic_id": 1668, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>A Farm for the Future</b>\n\n<div>I have just watched this video: <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/18161854#\">A farm for the future</a>\n\n</div><div>Absolutly amazing :)</div>", "created_at": "2012-06-09 07:08:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:16.240299", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 31, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31874, "user_id": 212, "topic_id": 2371, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>opensource unDocumentary</b>\n\nNice idea Jeff.\n\nI think this is an idea that @nicobis has been working on with the unDocumentary.

I'd also like to localize as much sovereignty as possible, but the more the globalization the more we need some sort of coordination, let alone the word centralization.</span> In this sense, I believe that we need new forms of governace at the state and global level, which let <em>other </em>people - with <em>other </em>interests <em>- </em>to be in charge. The problem is right on what you said: \"power struggle\". Present day politics and political institutions are patterned on centralizion and incentive struggle to gain power. We need to start from the assumption that power in democracy must be achieved as a result of coordination, not of competition. But this is another story...\n\n\u00a0\n\n@<span><span><a href=\"users/lyne-robichaud\">Lyne,</a></span></span>\n\nYou're extremely right when you says that \"<u>Citizens often feel disconnected, or disengaged</u>, about what the governement is proposing\", I wonder how can be possible! If there is such a large GAP, the answer is just one and \"double-face\": representatives are not representing (they are at least ruling), and society is not (able to) governing. In my opinion, this situation is unsolvable because of the structural distinction between politics and society. Nobody hold the Holy Grail and this must be crafted together. In this sense, the solution is in both \"deliberative\" and \"participatory\" democracy because they let the people enter more into the governing process through their \"representative\" groups.\n\nIn this sense, <u>PB can by no means be a source of (more) conflict (than now)</u>, because people learn the exact amount of resources (then the cuts) and deliberate directly on it (rather than delegate the responsibility to policy makers). And if they feel that the rule of games are really democratic (they provide with effective redistribution), despite the cuts, they are more willing to accept the results. What if the contrary happens: would people feel less frustrated?\n\nSo, you're doubly right: the policy makers have to release their power: I think they must behave like \"<strong>facilitators</strong>\" to empower citizens and their governing capacity. But to do so, democratic institution and participation has to change as well. PB is a method.\n\n\u00a0\n\n@<span><a href=\"users/ginevra\" title=\"View user profile.\">Ginevra</a></span>,\n\nThere are several cases of PB in Italy as well as over the world. But more than 2000 cases were recorded in total, many of those in <u>Latin America</u> of course, but many others in Europe as well. I believe that <u>Portugal </u>is definitely the most active country up to date (Lisbon, Cascais, Odemira). <u>Spain </u>used to have many PBs (Seville, before the financial crisis and the collapse of the Left. In my opinion, the most interesting (western) cases are spreading right now in <u>USA</u>: <a href=\"http://participatorybudgeting49.wordpress.com/\">Chicago </a>and <a href=\"http://pbnyc.org/\">New York </a>first of all, where Aldermans give their personal budget at disposal to the citizens.\n\nWith regards to <u>Italy</u>, to be honest, I do not really know the exact number of PBs, especially the quality. In any case:\n\n<ul><li>there used to be much more experiences in 2000 than now, when the Left and Social Movements were stronger, in the wake of the emerging global movements and the extraordinay experience of the World Social Forums. <em>Pieve Emanuele </em>(also called <a href=\"http://www.mesaverde.it/mesaverde/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=19&amp;Itemid=20\">Pieve Alegre</a>!) achieved huge notoriety on that time. Many other cities in Lombardia (Bergamo, Vimercate, Cernusco s/n), and Emilia Romagna also committed themselves in experiments, but I do not know their actual status. Anyway, as you know, since the Berlusconian regime came, there has been a rapid decline of initiatives. Among all, <a href=\"http://www.comune.grottammare.ap.it/contents/Bilancio+Partecipativo/50\"><em>Grottammare </em></a>was perhaps the first and the most interesting case, as PB were settled in 1994 by a civic list wo gathered people coming from the civil society and won the first elections after the scandal of corruption \"Mani Pulite\";</li></ul><ul><li>Tuscany has <a href=\"http://www.consiglio.regione.toscana.it/partecipazione/default.aspx?nome=home\">a regional law and an independent authority </a>which funds local projects of participation, so that there are many Municipalities which are trying to implement PB, like <a href=\"http://www.comune.capannori.lu.it/node/9066\">Capannori</a>, Arezzo, etc. Cascina was also funded by the Region;</li></ul><ul><li>participation has never been high: it's about 1-2% of the citizenry. In my opinion, this is because PB has always been seen as a form of <em>direct democracy</em> based on (sometimes <span><span><span>exhausting) </span></span></span>meetings and assemblies where people elaborate proposal directly and vote them.</li></ul>In any case, <u>the problem is </u>that nobody really knows what PB exactly is as any initiatives which involve citizens to decide over the public expenditures is labelled as such: so, everybody call their own participatory initiatives as PB but many of those are not really PB! Participatory urban planning area sometimes called PB, but it is not. Even consultative assemblies (people are asked to propose, but not to decide) are called PB.\n\n<u>I don't really know </u>about Italy because I started studying PBs in 2007 (so I lost the first wave of them) and in UK. However, I deliberately decided to focus on the original and most important one - Porto Alegre - in order to understand the social and political dynamics behind it which could have been replied somewhere else...like Italy!\n\n<u>What I found </u>is that PB is a cool way to involve people from civil society, gather citizens around their interests and let these people to emerge as representative of the urban life.\n\n<u>My strong critique </u>is that PB is by no means considered as a <em>radical democratic shift </em>to take it seriously, but just like a nice tool in the hand of politicians to better involve citizens, and not the contrary. It is not concidence that PB is more sponsored by City Councils or Mayors rather than citizens of civil society. Therefore, citizens come to award them, rather than themselves, and keep thinking PS as a service offered ranther than a right achieved! That is, in my opinion, the reason why even in Spain as well as in Italy, PBs collapsed at the same time that a political party flopped.\n\n<u>My aim </u>is turn it upside down and spread PB from the bottom-up. That's why we are building a web platform where citizens can set up a their own PB and try to be so much as to convince their Municipality to realize it (or, at least, their projects). As long as the majority of citizens become aware that this could be a new form of political participation (like - and perhaps more than - elections and referendum, etc.), PB will never produce positive effects. I think time is mature: a new wave of participation is emerging and I think it is because of the large diffusion of the web. So, we must seize the moment!\n\n\u00a0\n\n@<span><a href=\"users/bembo-davies\" title=\"View user profile.\">Bembo </a></span>,\n\nI also think that <u>Mix</u> has been extremely powerful and amazing! That's why I believe on the power of relations and I don't believe on ideologies at all! I am looking forward to know your antidote too!

And that allows you freedom to talk about things in a different way that you can do if you are talking about in the present\n\nAlioune Sall\n\nwhen we talk about using the future we should say: using the knowledge that we have about the determinents of the future.\n\nRiel Miller\n\nSo in a Knowledge Laboratory, that is aimed in developing people future litteracy as a learning process, learning by doing, we engage people to think about their future, something they care about.\n\nJudith Aidoo\n\nLet me give you an example: In Ghana we are getting a group of people together every month- creatives, thinkers, lawyers, architects, artists, musicians\u2026anybody who\u2019s creative by nature. And we\u2019re getting them together to think about, to explore what\u2019s happening on the ground , how are people imagining or reimagining our culture, our art, our buildings with a particular purpose in mind: we know that Africa is going to almost double in the next 20 years. It will be the youngest continent in the world, and no one has thought through, at least no one that we can see, how to address this huge opportunity and some people call it a challenge. So this means that anybody who can think creatively out of the box, who can imagine something that\u2019s never been seen before and come up with creative solutions is addressed. We wanna give these people room, we wanna incourage people.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJohn Sweeney\n\nSo I was on a team that went to Myanmmar, or Burma, and we put together the Myanmmar futures exchange which was at the time the largest and actually the first foresight event to get people together and to give them tools to think about the future. And what we found in those contexts was that it really allowed to have new conversations, it allowed them to challenge the existing norms. In a place like Myanmmar Burma you have all sorts of norms related to elders so initially if you have a conversation the older would speak and everybody else would listen. But the tools and exercises that we used and created allowed for more collaborative , more participatory means that examining things that are happening today and also the future context\n\nRiel Miller\n\nAs they talk about and they think about, they realize that they have assumptions, they realize that they are using the future for planning or for preparation\n\nJessica Bland\n\nWe worked with an open engagement group on social life but also with technology and engineering companies like our, and also with some scientific fiction authors to imagine different kinds of londonists in decades time, so in ten years time. We thought not just about londonist who are hi flying businessmen and women, but also about londonists who really care about the city, that want to create new kinds of communities, and finally we talked about londonists who could really be suffering in the future. So we talked about very different kind of londonists, people who embody very different kinds of trends and we didn\u2019t just create this in precence to\u00a0 policy makers. we directed a campaign about this future London a policy makers which required to respond. So we use the future as part of the campaign, we didn\u2019t just use it to do an exercise, we publish in a journal, or in a paper , in a corner, somewhere, and we were very noisy about the future.\n\nTanya Hichert\n\nSo I was really very privileged and lucky to work on two cases: Nairobi and Chennay, where the job was deliver scenarios for how these cities could look very different or could have different futures and in given to those futures one of the decision that people in the informal sector could take to empower themselves. And the project was not just about generating scenarios about how things could be different, it was very much structured around: what if you got these scenarios and you experience what the life could be like, what do you do in and on the basis of that generating ideas and actually prototyping and showing ideas, building ideas, materially, on how to iprove lifes given this incredible constrain of being poor being in the informal sector, being outside of the regular system.\n\nRiel Miller\n\nAnd they begin to question their assumptions, they begin to realize that if they change their assumptions they change their idea of the future and they begin to see that there are different ways of thinking about the future. And this builds up people\u2019s future litteracy.\n\nFred Dust\n\nwe were working with Greece, just before the beginning of the significant crisis and we were working on kind of thinking about the future democracy frankly that was used out but the reality was the real future, the crisis was actually only dated out so in fact the question of what is democracy didn\u2019t like matter when you basically saying: does the country even exist.\n\nKewulai Kamara\n\nUsing the future in crisis situations help actually to deal with crisis, deals with difficult situation.\n\nPeter de Smedt\n\nSo in a way you can strenghten people, you can build up resilience in your society by providing people tools to acknowledge that the first reaction is fear, that there are other possibilities and that they can, by taking a step back, and using future thinking, allow them to have hope, to think about possibilities, and also to share these tools. Resilience is also about being connected with people so doing the future thinking , sharing the future images with other people will also help you to accept what is happening now and to have kind of shared dreams of better futures.\n\nClaudia Juech\n\nWhy is that concept critical for us? Because I mean, people particularly poor, vulnerable people face constant challenges, crisis and chronic stresses and resilience is a concept to think about how can we strengthen the ability to deal with those challenges in a better way and to emerge from them more strongly. One of the elements to think about resilience that strengthens the resilience of individuals and communities is the ability to anticipate.\n\nRiel Miller\n\nSo the point about different ways of using the future and different anticipatory systems is that we are beginning to understand that all around us there are many kind of anticipation including \u00a0a form of anticipation that\u2019s not preparatory, that\u2019s not about preparing, that\u2019s not about planning. Which is saying: I will allow my idea of the future to change continuously so that I can see the present in different ways.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRiel Miller\n\nAnd we can begin to shift the contradiction that is really central to the current context we live in between diversity and freedom and planning and determinism, and we can become more confortable with the idea that the unknown and the unknowable are central to our values of liberty but are also fundamental to our reality. The Continuously creates the unknown and so instead of the unknown being an enemy, because it\u2019s detrimental to planning we can find a way to be more balanced between planning and preparation and emergence and novelty.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-28 23:23:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:20.289140", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1450, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33108, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3206, "post_number": 26, "raw": "<b>Enhancing collaboration skills</b>\n\nCollaboration and sharing are the master technology, the main tool for the 99%.

Here let me try a rant.</b>\n\nI got increasingly annoyed reading the paper to the point that I had to let off steam in the form of a rant :) It is far from perfect and I would appreciate holes being poked into it :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n<h2>It\u2019s not your fault. No one knows how to fix it. We\u2019re trying to figure it out together. Come help.</h2><div>Unpaid internships. Minimum wage work with little prospects for personal or professional development. A freelance lifestyle of working around the clock to chase contracts, produce the work and then chase the clients to be paid. It is true that there is a lot of exploitation on the labor market, that many are in a situation of work subordination without rights and are excluded from the privilege of \"having a steady job\". At the moment a \"steady job\" is out of reach for many people. Perhaps the job paradigm of our parents generation is running out of steam, perhaps it isn't.\u00a0 Actually let me rephrase that. The Job paradigm is already not accessible to many of us. This has implications for how we think about society and the role of the state in ensuring that the basic conditions for ensuring that we can enjoy the priveledge of going about the business of living our lives in peace, relative prosperity (read you have a roof over your head, garments to protect your body and are not starving) and personal freedom. Peace, relative prosperity and personal freedom. Things that most people in western Europe take for granted.\n\nWe all know that many of the challenges we are facing in our daily lives are heavily influenced by large structural challenges that act on a global scale. The pace at which conditions are changing is a key factor in our ability to react appropriately: many people are caught in the middle as they have neither been prepared for what is to come, nor had enough time and experience to be able to navigate it successfully. Formal education was pushed as the main ticket to a promising future, but in many directions formal educational institutions are coming under attack and access to them is becoming constrained. Whatever the underlying reasons we\u00a0 cannot rely on formal education to equip our young, and not so young, with skills required to make a successful navigation to autonomous adult lives.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Well can\u2019t we just get more young people to innovate, start companies and create jobs? </strong>\n\nWell, there are three major problems with that line of thinking. The first is that it assumes that we as society, and especially traditional markets are good at recognising, supporting and rewarding our innovators. The second is that it assumes that tomorrow\u2019s innovations increase or at least do not lower the demand for human labour. The third is that tricky little issue of our only having one planet of natural resources to sustain us and the reasoning above presumes that the young have no right to devise alternatives to the growth paradigm that threatens their very ability to survive.\n\n<strong>Markets &lt;3 radical innovators? </strong>\n\nGiven that we all agree that we need a lot of innovation to solve large urgent challenges like global warming,\u00a0ensuring food security, dealing with the fallout from financial crisis, upgrading our educational systems to better prepare our young...we can\u2019t afford to lose any of the talent and skills we have. In fact radicalism is a cheap way to try new things that with small probability may work. But it costs a lot in personal terms as the sources of support that are practically accessible to new kids on the block acting outside the formal spaces are few and far in between. Whether or not promising initiatives can come to fruition depends on many different factors. So we need to learn to recognise the value of this work and come up with ways of supporting it which do not rely on market value.\u00a0Because the traditional markets are just not doing the job.</div><div>Five cases:</div><ol>\n\n<li>Doing good for the common good: especially in the cases where the output of the work is a contribution to the commons or the common good. E.g. Hexayurt and or occupy as taking care of</li>\n\n<li>Doing something radically new or that threatens the market position of an established player: Private sector you have IP lawsuits threatening the hell out of everyone and raising barrier to entry. Monoculture and risk aversion:\u00a0 Lack of access to funding/ financing opportunities (compare to China\u2019s black finance market) with banks preferring speculation to risky investment in radically new initatives.. Jacky and the model.</li>\n\n<li>Lack of social maneuvering space: criminalising squatting, killing of social infrastrucutre and projects which have community support, argument making clear that enclosures of commons as a threat to innovation friendly ecosystem.</li>\n\n<li>Sorry state of finance: Lack of access to financial support [See Michel Bauwen\u2019s article on underground access to finance in China..]. (Tie to banks not investing in innovation) and general distrust of\u00a0 exploring alternative currencies like bitcoin.</li>\n\n<li>Most labour policy targetted at incentivising employers making it easier or cheaper for them to hire people but not rewarding individuals to explore alternative paths.</li>\n\n</ol><div>\n\n<strong>Where are the real allies? </strong>\n\nIn part due to the professionalization of education we see that formal educational and research facilities face decreasing autonomy and access to resources. Some argue that this is due to education having been a playground for different political and technocratic interventions and changing priorities (see Swedish jounalist\u00a0 Maciej Zaremba\u2019s excellent investigative series on the <strike>sorr</strike>y <a href=\"http://www.dn.se/Stories/stories-kultur/hem-till-skolan\">state of Swedish public education</a>). Others would point the finger at more political presence in education with members of the scientific and academic communities increasingly having to dance to the tune of funders political objectives: places that\u00a0 fact that once served as sanctuaries for the priveledged few giving them the resources autonomy to pursue groundbreaking work and make great contributions to culture in Europe. Others till would fault the formal education community for failing to adequately equip young people with the skills neccessary in order to be able to\u00a0 form frames of enquiry and means to test the relevance of what they were being taught to help them navigate their way in the world. They are made to feel as though they are somehow to blame if they don't manage to live up to older generations, and the immediate social environments, unrealistic expectations of constantly ascending career trajectories.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><strong>Europe needs a space program?!</strong></div><div>So Jacky mentioned this during Edgecamp, that Europe would need the equivalent of a space program to stay together. And around a month later I heard someone from the European Commission (Florent Bernard, Innovation Policy Officer) say the same in his <a href=\"http://tedxulg.be/tedxulg-lance-son-programme-dauditions/\">TEDx talk</a>: what will the big achievement of our generation be? The European Project 1.0 achieved peace. By interweaving economic interests of member states but the big driver was centralising the administration of\u00a0 steel production.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>I think a sense of purpose is a core issue. Beyond the narrow focus in phases. For example in Education that manifests in the progression: being good equals the progression: get the grades, graduate, get into university, pass the exams, get the degree, get a job, shut up, put up and pay your taxes.</div><div>\n\nIt is true that there are many people with autonomy and integrity who are doing important work contributing to the social, physical and mental well-being of people in their communities. They are doing things like exploring alternative ways of living and better coordinating between what we produce and the needs that are out there. Some, Like Alessia, are fighting political battles against enclosures of common resources that better equip us to be able to weather more dire economic prospects. Some, Like Licas, are committed to addressing needs such as ensuring food security in urban environments or equipping communities to better coordinate volunteer efforts to keep health systems going in areas where essential services are cut. As the state retreats on parts of the social contract we need to be asking ourselves who is responsible for ensuring that our communities are providing for our basic needs? And how do we get resources that are currently, or should be, put aside for this to people doing the work?\n\nThe reason I ask is that it seems that at the moment our young, and the Edgeryders among us, are currently bearing a disproportionate amount of the cost but are offered little support in return. They are pushed to become more \u201cemployable\u201d in a shrinking market where demand is contracting, i.e. there are not enough jobs to employ everyone period. They are also pushed to be \u201centrepreneurial\u201d and \u201cinnovative\u201d and faulted for not \u201cstarting new businesses\u201d. So is it possible to start asking some bigger questions that frame all the smaller policy hacks or initatives that we can patch together? What would your big questions be? And would you be up for trying to get answers to them?</div>", "created_at": "2012-08-24 09:43:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:32.695484", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1604, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21714], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30843, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 2130, "post_number": 21, "raw": "<b>Nice work Sam</b>\n\nThats a great video :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-01 15:43:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:49.743574", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11632, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4527, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Tuesday for interviews please</b>\n\nHi Samar, you mean tuesday right?

Perhaps a Future Project?</b>\n\nHi @Alberto,\n\nI suspect that we should understand these two projects as running in parallel, rather than collaboratively. MakEY (the project we're a partner in) is 100% focused on early years kids, devising workshops to help teachers gain confidence and skills to lead higher value making sessions for 5-8 year-olds, hopefully enthusing them with STEM. We're looking to have fun with robots, drawing, moulding things, playing with conductive materials and electricity; then we aim to develop best practices which we can disseminate to other school environments. A further objective may be to understand what kind of \"makerspace\" could be accommodated inside a school. As you'll no doubt be aware, there's an EU-wide problem with retaining young people in STEM learning, and this will put us in a poor position to compete globally, and make best use of the new transformations in manufacture.\n\nFrom our point-of-view at \"Makers\", our interest in making extends into the enterprises that making enables. We welcome the strategic engagement with making that MakEY suggests - but we also question whether the new, high-tech jobs that relocalised manufacture suggest are really real, or another digital illusion. If relocalised manufacture means nothing more than an \"automated manufacture pod\" attached to each supermarket, that robotically creates objects on demand from a centralised database, then, frankly, it is of little interest. While it may have some environmental advantages, it will only serve further to centralise wealth and employment. Only if relocalised manufacture reinvigorates locally-owned enterprises, bringing high skill, high quality jobs into neighbourhoods, will it have a positive economic effect, and only if it can help to relocalise the act of invention itself will it be a positive force on a cultural level.\n\nMeanwhile, of course, I have studiously avoided the implications of the B-word. However, as Britain dusts off its application to join the Third World, it'd be a very positive thing for us to build some bridges with our friends from the future.

The same word \u201cpre-judice\u201d means that we judge and label someone before knowing her/him. If a prejudice is shared and widespread among a group of people or, in a bigger scale, inside a society it becomes discrimination.\n\nWe live in a society ruled by the fear of the \u201cothers\u201d where clich\u00e9s and stereotypes are often the first step to racism. That\u2019s why in order to fight prejudices and fear the most important thing to do is talking with people and informing people. And this is even more essential when we think about new generations, especially teenagers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs volunteer I\u2019ve carried out \u2013 together with other 6 volunteers \u2013 many workshops inside secondary schools in Venice. My organization work to promote an anti-racist culture in many ways and the work that we do inside the school is probably the most important activity that we realize.\n\nWe\u2019ve met students from 10 different school aged from 14 to 19 and we\u2019ve talked about prejudices, discrimination and migration.\n\nOur workshop are made of three different sessions . During the first one we face the topic of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d trying to touch the real life of teenagers. \u201cHave you ever been discriminated?\u201d; \u201cWhy have you been discriminated?\u201d. We try to let them find out how discrimination affects our lives and how prejudices are \u201ccomfortable\u201d and \u201cmonotonous\u201d because labeling people is the fastest way to solve a problem and to put the blame on somebody else.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen \u2013 in the following two sessions \u2013 we talk deeper about racial, ethnic and religious discriminations analyzing the situation in Italy and in Venice.\n\nWe realize two different \u201cpaths\u201d: the first one focused on the \u201chistory of racism\u201d and the second one focused on the \u201cmass-media racism\u201d.\n\nIn the historical session we show information (texts, pictures, videos) about the different kind of \u201chunting\u201d during the human history against black people, Roma, Jewish, women, disabled, homosexuals and we show the similarity between the racism against Italian immigrants in America in 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> century and the racism against immigrants that arrive nowadays in Italy.\n\nIn the other sessions we focus on the languages used by mass-media (newspapers, internet, TV, advertisement) talking about the \u201cconstruction of the enemy\u201d through words and images; at the same time, we show the connection among \u201cinstitutional\u201d racism, \u201cpopular\u201d racism and mass-media racism explaining how these three elements are often related and are part of a larger system that wants to use migrants and ethnic minorities (like Roma) as scapegoats.\n\nDuring our session we also give a lot of space to do interactive and theatrical activities with youngsters. One of these are \u201cnei panni di\u201d (if I were in your shoes) in which participants should try to get into the shoes of some disadvantaged people (asylum seekers, orphans, economical migrants, etc.) imagining what they can do or they cannot do in their daily life (using internet, going out with friends, studying, renting a room,\u2026). Another activity asks them to create a group that will become \u201cthe community\u201d and the rest of the class should try to get into that community (as a migrant does when comes in a new country or as a student does when she comes in a new school) persuading one member of the community to welcome her/him (e.g. showing her/his abilities or her/his needs). Another activity is representing with the body concept like power, welcome, safty, ...\n\nThis experience is realy interesting becouse youngsters react in different ways but at the end they are never the same as at the beginning...\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-10 14:00:57", "updated_at": "2017-09-09 03:06:04.798600", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 641, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32979, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5163, "post_number": 33, "raw": "<b>Cool, joining us?</b>\n\nIf so and you need a ticket...documentation tasks for a ticket :))\u00a0<a href=\"/t/documentation-harvesting-of-lote-what-why-how/5222\">https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/documentation-harvesting-of-lote-what-why-how</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-25 16:43:47", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:01.017111", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 47, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [32952], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13200, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 1946, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>ok </b>\n\nok, (about 'call a human\u00a0')\u00a0so for now let's do it as Noemi said, I can add the names to the view.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-16 15:28:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.744817", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13162], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30438, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 5571, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>June 21 till June 23-24 is more accurate</b>\n\nIt would be a pity that some of us come in on June 21st and escape the next day on June 22nd.

But this is no longer the case. During \\#31C3 1C3, biometrics researcher Jan Krissler showed how he had created usable fingerprints of Germany\u2019s Federal Minister of Defense, Ursula von der Leyen \u2013 without coming into physical contact with her in any way. With the help of software available to everyone, like VeriFinger, Krissler used a digital camera to photograph the minister\u2019s hands during a public speech. As she moved her hands about during the speech, Krisler captured high resolution images of von der Leyen\u2019s fingertips. He manipulated those images with the commercially available software, \u201cVeriFinger,\u201d to create fingerprints that can fool biometric authentication.

We should not do it for our own security, which is perceived as low priority by most of us as we have nothing to hide; we should do it for others, like the courageous journalists and whistleblowers keeping our society marginally truer and more free, who need more people to use crypto so they can \"get lost in then crowd\": and for ourselves, as a shared learning journey to upskill all of Edgeryders. In other words, we should do it not as individuals, but as a community. Crypto never went mainstream because it is hard, but (1) the tech is getting easier and (2) the more skilled edgeryders can help the less skilled ones. While at 31C3, we started the <a href=\"/t/community-crypto/425\">Community Crypto</a> project. A little hacking by Massimo brought us within spitting distance of a user-friendly solution: if we can get a reply from the Mailpile team we are in business! We could maybe join forces with <a href=\"https://degrowth.co-munity.net/ecobytes\">Ecobytes</a> for the provision of mailboxes, I have a hunch they might be interested.\n\n+1 from <a href=\"/u/elf_pavlik\">@elf_Pavlik</a>\n\n4. <strong>Setting up community kitchens and food/drink based activities are great way to bring a diverse group of people together and serve the community at events</strong>.\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f0bab9738a6a29a3a1c60e1834f63be7f6d80afd.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n<em>Makgeolli workshop during \\#31C3 lead by Algoldor, photos by Lotte Smelik</em>\n\nAs Alberto points out the congress experience \"was made so much better by having a \"home\" in the broader 31C3 space\". From the experience of building and running the unMonastery and our annual LOTE events, we have collectively learned how important food is for health and well-being of communities and individuals. Not just eating good, healthy food but the activities of preparing it and how we go about eating it.\u00a0 So collaborating with a <a href=\"http://foodhackingbase.org\">community of hackers and food and drink enthusiasts who run activities at hacker events</a> like ccc camps and OHM was a no-brainer. So we joined the Food Hacking Base assembly: <a href=\"/u/thomas_goorden\">@Thomas_Goorden</a> and I led a weMixology/Agape workshop with help from <a href=\"/u/sammuirhead\">@SamMuirhead</a>. Also a tea corner was set up by Thomas <a href=\"/u/msanti\">@msanti</a> and <a href=\"/u/dorotea\">@Dorotea</a>.\n\nOver the years the Food Hacking Base community has managed to collect equipment to be able to set up a fully functional kitchen for a large number of people with stoves, ovens, sinks and lots of work surfaces plus all the smaller stuff like knives, cutting boards and even more advanced equipment. The kitchen is used both 1) to run experimental or pedagogical food related activities like cheese making, or Korean Fermented food and beverage production workshops...2) to cook healthy, delicious food by event participants for conference/camp/event participants. This is also very helpful for people who wish to have a bit more control of what they eat (and how much it costs) than is allowed by e.g. commercial catering services. I (Nadia) ended up spending a lot of time at the FHB during \\#31C3 and am considering setting an Edgeryders food hacking group in Brussels this year. let's see. A huge thank you to Frantisek, Marcel, Ingo, Brabo, Daan, Lotte and the rest of the FHB community, it was great!\n\n5. <strong>Workshop \"The Machine To Be Another\"</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.themachinetobeanother.org/\">http://www.themachinetobeanother.org/</a>\n\nAs a follow-up of the talk: <a href=\"http://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/events/6385.html\">http://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/events/6385.html</a> they organized a Workshop on day 4.\n\nIt was supposed to test the equipment, but some hardware problems stopped the demo.

So each one sees from the other's perspective. This setup works best with, i.e., dancers that ave a high perception of their bodies and are able to rapidly immerse in this experience.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nIn general, they are searching for suggestion for new application of the actual prototype or to possible improvements.\n\nby <a href=\"/u/msanti\">@msanti</a>\n\n6. <strong>2015 is going to be an important year for copyright reform</strong>\n\nOne of the more interesting talks was - for me - <a href=\"http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6350_-_en_-_saal_2_-_201412291400_-_correcting_copywrongs_-_julia_reda.html#video\">Julia Reda's \"Correcting copywrongs\"</a>\u00a0(Well worth watching.) The short version is that there is a gigantic need in the EU to consolidate copyright law over the different member states, simply because it has become nigh impossible to know what copyright law you might be breaking in any random EU country by doing simple things like taking panoramic pictures or quoting people. The current chaotic situation is - probably above all else - commercially unattractive, which is why we may expect reform soon. Cynicism aside, this is cause for cautious optimism, as we may use this opportunity to finally get some more decent copyright law in place (assuming the simple fact that it is probably not going away soon). One big advantage for the general public is the big success that was the EU copyright consultation, in which it became clear that the copyright industries' desires are often highly conflicting with civilian uses of authored work. Since copyright has been skewed so much against consumers, we might actually see a correction in the other direction and Julia Reda seems *very* ready for that discussion.\n\nBy <a href=\"/u/thomas_goorden\">@Thomas_Goorden</a>\n\n- Amen to that by <a href=\"/u/alberto\">@Alberto</a>\n\n7. <strong>Most cell phone (GSM) networks are incredibly insecure</strong>\n\nOne of the more shocking demonstrations of the security vulnerabilities of cell phone networks was \"<a href=\"http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6249_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412271715_-_ss7_locate_track_manipulate_-_tobias_engel.html#video\">SS7: Locate. Track. Manipulate.</a>\" in which the presenter showed that pretty much any cell phone can be located or redirected, even if you only have the number. This is due to fundamental security flaws in the telephony system which was originally designed with \"benevolent state actors\" in mind, which is to say incredibly bad at protecting any modicum of privacy. Unfortunately, there is very little one can do, save for just turning the cell phone off (but your number and probably SMS's can still be redirected then). There are a few cell phone companies that are taking measures to prevent some of the worst infractions, but it's hard to even verify that.

Everyone welcome to contribute or comment (needs a signup though).</em>\n\nLike every community, our barter economy community needs a way to found and grow it. In our case, we weill start lcoally with a pilot community in Matera, southern Italy, alongside the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/\">unMonastery</a> project. But how?\n\nHere are our current ideas for local community development modes, excluding the pure Internet and global ones. Since we have no practical experience with community building in the team, we appreciate all input from networking and communications people which of these ideas are applicable in Southern Italy, and how. This is just an idea collection \u2013 we don't have a plan for Matera yet, but you can help us make a plan :-)\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><strong>Starting from existing communities.</strong> As pointed out by <a href=\"http://matslats.net/\">Matslats</a> from <a href=\"http://communityforge.net/\">Community Forge</a> when discussing alternative economics with him, it is better to support existing communities by providing them with tools than to start a new one. I would add, it is also more time-efficient. What communities are there in Matera who might want to add barter exchange for mutual help? Candidates are, among others, coworking spaces, weekly agro markets, hackerspaces, community gardens, collective consumption groups, ... .</li>\n\n<li><strong>Integrate with a makerspace.</strong> This should be a nice hangout place for the young unemployed. So basically it has to be open a good part of the week, as an open access space where no membership is required (except maybe a fee in barter, which the makerspace may then use to purchase common tools from members etc.). The social dynamics of makerspaces are of course non-transactional for a start, with lots of generous free help, and this should be kept. However, when people need a lot of help with own projects, it's socially unacceptable to ask for that, and here barter exchange has its place. There should be a way how the people and resources in this makerspace can collaborate with and contribute to other projects of the unMonastery, and community projects for the city \u2013 see some <a href=\"/economy-app/collaborative-barter-economy\">proposals for that</a>. Accidental business idea generation in this space is  \"allowed\" :-) Some people might be able to earn a living in barter after some time of hacking away on their ideas, and that's exactly what Economy App wants to facilitate.\n\nHopefully, unMonastery could provide the physical space for a makerspace. Economy App would provide an initial collection of the most important tools, and people would bring in more tools and materials over time. Oh I just see that <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MateraArduinoUG\">Matera has a hackerspace</a> already. And of course there's also <a href=\"http://www.benetural.com/\">Casa Netural</a>. Nice. No need to duplicate efforts.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Maker parties.</strong> Parties are a good way for seeding and growing a community, as <a href=\"/t/the-unmonasterians-guide-to-matera/1119/9\">proposed by Alberto</a> where he mentions that parties are one of his fav tools of public policy ... :-) The themes would be somehow connected to the \"productive fun / enjoyable work\" of the barter economy as we envision it. A natural way would be having regular parties when having a makerspace anyway, something where people from Matera and farther off can gather to show their creations. This can be anything from pure fun stuff to artful things and products for daily use, and all can be offered in the barter economy software so that people can wish for them and get their own ones afterwards.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Neighborhood parties or something?</strong> What are viable modes to connect with the immediate neighborhood of the unMonastery in the Sassi?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Maker warehouse / brick-and-mortar barter shop.</strong> Something that, again, would well integrate with a makerspace: a showroom where (1) makerspace raw materials are for sale in barter, like defective electronics for parts etc., and (2) where people's makerspace creations are permanently shown and can be acquired via network barter, either the very objects or equivalent ones that are made to order. The same concept could be possible in a small publicly accessible brick-and-mortar shop somewhere in the city, or in the unMonastery building itself (then combined with a hangout space). A physical presence might be quite a strong invitation to get to know the network barter concept, and possible to get engaged in it. It's like a \"shopping experience\", just that you can \"only\" look around and wish for the products (by scanning a QR code with your smartphone), because they are only for barter, not for sale in money. This might be \" a feature, not a bug\", as it's ok to just look around, not feeling compelled to buy anything. The products, which might include a good part of unusual and creative handicraftswork like on <a href=\"http://etsy.com/\">Etsy</a>, would be interesting to look at and to test out, and would frequently change, so people would hopefully stop by frequently.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Community mapping.</strong> It may be that the many people like the barter economy idea, but lack the time or motivation to indeed start with it (similar to how most people know it's good to encrypt your e-mail, and still don't do it because they don't find the time to set it all up). This problem could be fixed if the platform operators or enthusiastic users visit those interested in joining, and set up their account, offers and wishes in half an hour of interviewing them. But what would be a good way (for Southern Italy) to find such interested people who need this last bit of support to join?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Local exchange meetings as community magnet.</strong> This is an idea practiced in a direct producer-to-consumer agricultural market in Volos, Greece: they hold a bi-weekly meeting where orders are fulfilled. Doing something similar in a local barter economy would (1) fix the problem of having to trust the seller for delivery, as everyone knows they will both receive and give at the same meeting, (2) solve the delivery logistics very efficiently via a central hub and (3) would provide a nice community event that interested people can join, without committing to the barter economy yet.</li>\n\n<li><strong>The month of barter.</strong> (This one is inspired by fellow Edgeryder @sammuirhead's <a href=\"http://yearofopensource.net/\">Year of Open Source</a> \u2013 look it up, it's very ... inspiring :-) The idea is to persuade a (relatively small, maybe 5-10 people) subgroup of unemployed people in an initial, larger pilot barter community to try living from barter alone for one month. Then evaluate and publish the results \u2013 if it works, it would be quite spectacular and could make it into national press. With this added publicity, repeat with larger and larger groups and for longer times. When it works out well and is published well, people might finally switch to living from barter permanently.</li>\n\n</ol>", "created_at": "2013-07-07 10:20:52", "updated_at": "2018-03-04 10:37:04.484700", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1207, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 430.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9520, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4201, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Posponed</b>\n\nDone, but there are issues.

Apparently, there have been moments in which people with some kind of mission do heavy movements - think UK\u2019s National Health Service \u201cfrom the cradle to the grave\u201d redesign back in 1948 <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/nhs.aspx\">http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/nhs.aspx</a>. But after that, just like after moving the family to a new home, it looks like things interact with the rest of our lives,\u00a0pile up, deteriorate, or are at most minorly mantained or redesigned.\n\nThe result, in Europe (lots of adjacent countries), is that\u00a0there\u2019s a variety of national healthcare systems, each the result of their own national circumstances. They are very different (more or less money, more or less services, different ways to link payment with services, etc) and I\u2019m sure we could learn from each other if we are to have meaningful conversations. A Swedish evaluation (I\u2019m not linked to any of that, and my scientist trainers insisted that we should to try and look at the methods before believing in conclusions) looks at 35 such systems (<a href=\"http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=2\">http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=2</a>) and even dares to rank them (<a href=\"http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/Report-EHCI-2012.pdf\">http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/Report-EHCI-2012.pdf</a>). I haven\u2019t read any of that in full, mind you: it\u2019s just a window into the diversity of systems, probably with a view to answer the questions given by whoever paid\u00a0for the evaluation, and not necessarily useful for us.\n\nIn any case, I\u2019m personally interested in these systems\u2019 failure modes. In Spain, we\u2019re seeing how a system designed for a younger pyramid of people, mostly healthy and paying taxes, more or less worked for a number of decades, and seems to be rapidly deteriorating due to a number of factors:\n\n- Demography: more elderly people (I read somewhere that people over 65 years old spend a lot more than the younger ones, so an increase of 1% in the number of older people hits the common wallet disproportionately) and a smaller proportion of tax-payers (same effect).\n\n- Technology: more newer and more expensive medications and surgical procedures that are applied more often. This is a good thing (\u201chey, replace my hip so I can learn to play golf at 95 years old\u201d), but it\u2019s also more expensive. Also, it grows exponentially, while money grows linearly at best - or it used to, anyway. And that differential creates tension and pain: \u201csure I\u2019m only going to have x-rays, and not that other fancy dynamic computarised image in full colour?\u201d.\n\n- Management: healthcare systems are wicked. Two examples from a few years ago are: if you reduce waiting lists in surgery by having surgeons work also in the evenings, you increase waiting lists in the services in charge of post-surgery care, and the motivation; and if you pay them to work in the evening then they are less motivated (and more tired) to work in the morning. And management is part of that mess.\n\n- Economy: not just through demography, technology and management (factors which have been at work for a few decades now), but now as a result of the economic mess Europe is in right now. Those with their hands on the common purse\u2019s strings use their best judgment to effect deep cuts - which are then hated by everybody else. As in \u201ccan\u2019t you see that if we don\u2019t prevent cancer we\u2019ll have to cure cancer and that\u2019s more expensive?\u201d.\n\nIn short, at least in Spain, healthcare systems seem to be biting more than they can chew, changes are being pushed without much time for consultation (which would be messy at best), and it\u2019s the weaker who pay for it more (too many examples). A clinician I know described the situation as one of disease in the healthcare system itself: it\u2019s insufficient in the same way a heart can be insufficient, when it can pump blood forward, but less than is needed, so you get swallen legs (waiting lists), pain for lack of fresh blood (lack of resources), etc. If the aethiologic (causational) factors are still there, then the disease won\u2019t go away, etc.\n\nEven the World Health Organisation has been looking into it very recently. <a href=\"http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/event/oslo-conference-on-health-systems-and-the-economic-crisis\">http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/event/oslo-conference-on-health-systems-and-the-economic-crisis</a> Maybe they could use some help. \\#justsaying\n\nThings could get magically better, but there could also be at least two basic failure scenarios: we muddle through with this economic/peak-everything crisis and we boil slowly and frog-like, or something faster (an economic crash, a war, a pandemic) gets in the way and we\u2019re toast rapidly. Chronic vs Acute *systemic* failure. In an acute failure, we\u2019d have to <em>go all catastrophologic and think about reducing deaths (1), mostly the easily avoidable ones in the younger ones, using whatever it takes</em>. With chronic failure, we can also include pain (2) and disability (3) - and look into<em> wisely redesigning some subsystems for maximum effect</em>. (The classic fourth priority, aesthetics (4) is either social pain/disability or luxury.)\n\nWhat to do? What can we do as edgeryders. I\u2019m completely lost here. The way Alberto puts it: \u201cimportant problems, lots of opportunities, but little capacity\u201d. But there are some ideas anyway:\n\n1) There's the idea to create a wikipedia for health-care systems. Maybe one project would be to describe our different healthcare systems using some kind of grid?\n\n2) Some folks are working on \u201copen data policy for health care\u201d. We\u2019d also need \u201copen thinking on open data\u201d.\n\n3) Maybe the kind of thinking outlined in our pandemic booklet can be deepened for chronic scenarios? Needs x Jurisdiction?\n\n4) Maybe we need to have better aims? What\u2019s the worst pain that we should prioritise? Any good leverage point for systemic intervention?\n\n\u00a0\n\nOk - this ends my \u201cbrain dump\u201d at the moment. As I said, I\u2019m as lost as anyone, and I feel I can\u2019t even pose meaningful questions for us to answer. So, open space!\n\n", "created_at": "2013-05-03 11:10:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:50.420368", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1150, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23005, "user_id": 2945, "topic_id": 5222, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Hackpad also figured out\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-20 13:03:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.740330", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21676], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2712, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2679, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>A big part of the reason the Edgeryders community manages to get such ambitious initiatives off the ground with few resources is because we collaborate well online through the platform.

Firstly I think it is a phase in which we do need to have a few more calls to find a common direcition and this early phase in the project. At th consortium meeting we did the first part of setting the foundations, but that is only the first step. We now need to tackle the actual content of the research, how we will weave this all in together...and think together really :) Last week we did have the first of the open calls and it was very helpful. We tested a software that was not really up to the job, se we will stick to google hangout from now on. Now for the \"meat\" in the comment:</em></div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>Yesterday Ezio and I met in London to think together around how to proceed with our part of the research. I had been struggling to understand the distinction Ezio was making the sense in which we are exploring \"Openness\" in the context of care. I\u00a0 think I understand better now, and think I am algined with Ezio, and away from Alberto, that it is the first which is more fruitful/interesting. For me the openness has to do with more porous interface between what is inside a cateogry or institution or practice, a place..etc and what is outside. And what happens in those situations where there is a fuzzy, or een decomposing boundary between them. Professional caregivers, vs others. Between <a href=\"/en/opencare/open-care-as-radical-socio-technical-innovation-reflecting-on#comment-22010\">insiders and outsiders of a community</a>. Between users and builders of technologies.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>Less so the collaborative, participatory nature of our research project. Which for me is given. The very fact that we are having this conversation like this, in the open, with all the difficulties of comprehension that it involves mean that we are already doing this. Seen from here, the conversation we are really trying to have is one of research curation, where to direct our gaze and why. As well as the filter through which we look at it.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>During yesterday's conversation Ezio and I reflected on how Europe had reacted to the Paris attacks. How a small number of individuals could shut down two countries for a two days. Similarly it is remarkable that in the world's wealthiest continent, a relatively small number of refugees can destabilise the entire system. Can this\u00a0 be tied to people's sense of being vulnerable, even with nice jobs etc? Can it be there is a sense of lack of social protection because of not being firmly anchored in caring communities?\n\n\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>But what does this term community actually mean in a contemporary, urban situation? Ezio's work at Central Saint Martins has been exploring this. His students have been looking at weaving together people and places in situations where connections are fleeting and ephemeral (not like in villages where you are stuck with one another in the same place for better or worse). Noemi, Alberto and myself have been working with related things with Edgeryders, creating a sense of place and community that remains even though the relationships which make it (who is there, who interacts with whom, what people connect over etc) are constantly changing. John, before us with other settings and constellations of people. It seems Ezio and I have arrived at the same intuition and this is where his interest in Opencare lies:\u00a0<em> </em>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div><em>How can we use design to reconcile this need for the individual to be free to choose their level of engagement in care, with the need for the care recipient to feel continuity, local anchoring and coherence design these factors into existing or new initiatives?</em></div>\n\n<div>\n\n<em>Can having an option to spread the care over more people nudge more people to engage in caring activities? And if so, under which conditions\u00a0 does this happen or not </em><em><em>(which are the critical factors)</em>?</em>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>There are three situations within which it may be especially generative to focus our research attention:</div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Social and or health care of refugees in Germany/Europe</li>\n\n<li>Prevention of Suicide in the hacker community</li>\n\n<li>Helping both caregivers and care receivers in dealing with dementia in urban environments</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<div>These three areas we choose because they are situations in which the crisis of care in modernity is very\u00a0 visible. I think (please forgive my fumbling approach to articulate intuition into words with my limited understanding of your areas of expertise and interest):</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>All three involve people in vulnerable situations where dynamics in community connections, or lack of, play a significant role.</strong> Can Guy/Alberto's network science perspective help us to make visible and understand these social flows?</li>\n\n<li><strong>All three also involve some interaction with the formal health and social care system, conditions as well as norms/behaviors in society at large</strong>. Can Erik and Tino's approach help us make sense of this and translating it into institutionally comprehensible language?</li>\n\n<li><strong>All three also involve and require a deep understanding of healing and medical practice, especially the ethical considerations for both caregivers and care recipients</strong>. Can Marco, Massimo's and other's work in the field and in the lab help us to identify and understand how to deal with these issues? In the research as well as in the intiatives themselves?</li>\n\n<li><strong>The city as a place and institutions is where all of these interactions and relationships live (or do not). </strong>Can Lucia and Rossana and others in the city of Milano help us understand how a city can make visible and enable promising approaches and nurturing the people who drive them?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Can we design interventions offer workarounds to the obstacles these intiatives, and the indivuals they attempt to support (caregivers and care recipients)?</strong> What forms could these interventions take in order to unlock more care in the different situations (artefacts, communication, services, processes, upskilling, administrative and legal hacks, policy changes and or something else? Here I think the ingenuity and very particular skillset of Costantino, Zoe and others in the weMake constellation could make a very important contribution.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThoughts?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-18 11:24:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:50.670363", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1134, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8884, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1620, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>HOW to transform a culture to make room for individual voices?</b>\n\nJorge, it is wonderful to discuss with you...\n\nDominating forces.

The references that were given to me were mostly males, except for one woman. What does this mean? That I'm a 'bad' open government activist??? Hey, I protest!\n\nIt does not make any sense to me to imagine implementing a new style of governance based on collaboration, if we don't get rid of the dominating attitudes first. It will just never work, it won't flow well. Success would probable not be at the rendez-vous. There are other models of leadership (power) that exist, based on different sets of values and different attitudes. In order to have these different attitudes, we must understand the nature of power, and realize that there is another way of obtaining power than by steeling away the energy of other people by domination or manipulation. Dominance is a way of getting energy from others, or money, or steeling their power. It is always an attempt to get from someone else, instead of being self-sufficient, or relying on inner strenght.\n\nHow come the 'good' open gov guys do not get this? It's crystal clear to me. One explanation could be because they are males. Or because they tend to rationalize everything, and leave out the possibility that there exists an intuitive approach to personal and professional relationships, business management and even governance.\n\nI score very high on a GROP psymetric test (<a href=\"http://www.psymetrik.com/html/fr/questceque.php\">Guide de Recherche d'une Orientation Professionnelle</a>). It is fascinating to realize that there actually exists a test for professional purposes, that measures intuition. Therefore, intuition must be some sort of 'good' skill to have, otherwise one would not bother to measure it, right? Intuition applies to professional activities (not just personal lives, in between 4 walls, hidden alone, so that nobody sees you doing it).\n\nThe way the decisions have been taken by governments and organisations leaves out the citizens, or leaves out the voices of a community, as you explained so well. To reverse this, what should we do? How do we transform a culture of government, of businesses, to make room for more respect for individual voices, and the collective intelligence?\n\nI have been trying to imagine these past months a model of an ideal Man, that would not live by the dominance standards that we have known for a couple of milleniums. I called it a Luminous Man. My model, it is perceived as too disruptive from the status quo. Maybe I did not use enough negative words?! I stayed on the positive side too much, on the opposite side of the current spectrum, and people perhaps have a hard time understanding this perspective, because they stand on the 'dark' side. They swim in the dominating world everyday, and it's just the way it goes, and should go. I protest! There is another way. And for open goverment, there should be this other way. There are people standing outside the dark room. There are people who understand the mechanisms to avoid dominance. I believe that it is possible to live together in a more balanced world.\n\nKeep talking about this stuff. We need more discussions like this.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-06 21:51:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:51.346412", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 757, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1370, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1337, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u201c<em>Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school</em>.\u201d\n\n\u201c<em>The only real valuable thing is intuition</em>.\u201d (Albert Einstein)\n\nAs far as I can remember, I have asked myself what is the mind, what is the body, what is the exact nature of reality, but more importantly, what I am doing here, where do I come from, and where am I going. NONE OF THIS IS TAUGHT IN SCHOOL. Yet, these are the most important things that one can learn in life. The rest is so not important that my memory immediately clears it. In the Art history university program, I was unable to remember dates and names of works of art. Everything had to be memorized, and I found it was ridiculous. With much effort, I managed to retain enough to pass the tests. But as soon as it was over, I forgot the information.\n\nI wandered in the educational system, from the beginning till the end. In first grade, I was already bored to death, and instead of focusing on what the teacher said, I spent my time observing with detachment my remaining years of education until university. I was six years old.\n\nIn 1st grade, I was also fighting between the teacher and my parents, because I preferred writing with my left hand, and was ordered to use my right hand. \"<em>Why</em><em> cannot I use the hand that I want?</em>\", I kept wondering. After all, this is MY hand and that is MY brain. Why cannot I do what pleases me with my own body? Adults had no explanations for this. I had to comply, it was the rule. Very early in life, I was faced with an excess of rigidity of systems. Each time, I responded by transcendence.\n\nThey refused me to be left-handed (ie being myself)? I became ambidextrous. I found the compromise and applied this formula to pretty much everything.\n\nI knew, from as long as I could remember, that I am not just a skin encapsulated ego in a container of flesh and bones. I spent most of my life trying to learn, adjust and live in another reality.\n\nOne thing I learned over the years\u00a0 - THIS IS NOT TAUGHT IN SCHOOL - is that perception, what I see, hear, touch, taste, and smell, is the least reliable test of what reality really is. The senses give us a distorted view. Therefore, what should we think of what is taught in school? Our current understanding is that the world is made up of matter that exists in space and time, and that our human bodies are nothing other than bits and pieces of matter.\n\nEven though we have developed highly sophisticated educational systems, it does nothing to help us understand who we are and what happens to us in life.\n\n\u201c<em>I caught a cold.\u201d \u201cI can not stop scratching, my body is covered with a rash.\u201d \u201cWhen I got up this morning, my hip was locked and I do not understand where it comes from.\" \u201cMy knees are worn and I'll have to get surgery.\" \u201cI had an accident, I broke my leg.</em>\u201d I listen to people talk about their illnesses and injuries. In the majority of cases, they understand nothing of what happens to them. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT TAUGHT IN SCHOOL. Most of the time, I explain (in my head) what are their life conditions that probably led to their current health condition, and I usually tell them none of this, because I know they would not understand anyway. When people get sick, they go see a doctor, an \"expert\", who spent x number of years in school and got x number of degrees. We are expected to trust our lives to these people, because they supposedly have magic bullets for the treatment of illness. If you can't sleep at night. No problem. There's a sleeping pill. It will cure your insomnia. If you are feeling anxious. There is a tranquilizer. It will give you tranquillity. If you have an infection. There is an antibiotic. It will cure the problem of your infection. Etc. These relieve symptoms, they camouflage them, while the underlying process remains UNCHANGED.\n\nWe do this with our own health.\n\nDo we apply another formula to cure problems of larger systems? Not really.\n\nSomething is wrong! Education systems and their contents do not allow us to alter the overall expression of disease in population, or to alter the deeper problems of our society. It merely changes their expression. The overall picture does not change because the model that has been structured (of the human body, of reality, etc.) is not the correct model.\n\nScience is discovering that we are a thinking body, ie that every cell thinks. Every cell is a mind. Every cell has its own desires and communicates with every other cell. We have a body-mind simultaneously everywhere. If we project this to a larger scale, every citizen thinks for himself/herself, every citizen has his/her own desires and should be able to connect to All, and collaborate to processes.\n\nWith the open government philosophy and possibilities offered by new technologies, it becomes possible to apply this scientific new finding to governance.\n\nIn conclusion, what I needed to learn in life, <em>the important stuff</em>, I never learned it from school.\n\nWhat I need to learn now,<em> the important stuff</em>, that will help me in my personal and professional, this knowledge does not exist yet.

(However, it is starting to look better now with some sort of hybrid mini flea market with barter elements.)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI tried to identify possible reasons for this and mainly complained about two factors:\n\n\u00a0\n\n- high level of individualism and need for authorization (low swarming levels, if I get the word \"swarming\" right),\u00a0\n\n- and about identity: fear of looking like a poor.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThings which were\u00a0so far helpful:\n\n\u2022 Basic research: talk to people and try to figure out the best ways to present bartering so it is acceptable for everyone to engage in. This answers the identity question. Clear invitation for \"sustainably getting rid of old crap\" gained consent.\u00a0\n\nThis also allowed me to find equally interested people, without whom I inevitably feel like an idiot.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022 Keep this stuff iterative:\u00a0\n\n- obvious: nothing gives you more insight than a prototype.\n\n- don't push for barter as such, market it as a flea-market and identify early adopters of barter. Funny enough, barter naturally starts for two reasons: shortage of small cash money and the moral difficulty to set the price on something that you think is a piece of old crap.\u00a0\n\n- everyone under 18 prefers barter due to the limited access to currencies.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022 Assumptions which turned out to be completely wrong.\n\nI assumed that people will find it more comfortable to keep it online (create a wordpress gallery). It turns out that people are more willing to participate to the real life event.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis might happen for several reasons: uploading your old stuff to an online gallery makes you permanently engaged in the bartering activity (which is might be regarded as a sign of destitution), which is more identity challenging. Flea market model is less identity threatening.\n\nSecondly, an online gallery entails a need to engage in the actual bartering process at any time (when someone wants to swap something on something you have), and requires rather extravert mindset. It is easier with city-wide FB groups, as you feel less obliged to answer than to your immediate neighbors.\n\nAlso, pictures of ones private old sofa presented for exchange online makes some feel a bit of an exhibitionist, I suppose.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, no, people in the house I live, don't want to have their old stuff in the online gallery.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI can think of combining the two: going forward with the online gallery (just keep old stuff), but keep it mainly for promotion of the RL barter day in spring.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-20 15:18:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:42.284090", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1155, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21112, "user_id": 2805, "topic_id": 4611, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Who we are and what we do</b>\n\nWe are a small NGO founded back in 2011 and we are very interested in exploring and promoting heritage.

The option here is, then, for you and interested parties, like @fortyfoxes, to start using it for smaller decision making tasks and display its long term value.\n\nIn the current state of things, it seems the mailing list has become the predominant form of communication, with Trello relegated to a tool to point to other documents - images, spreadsheets, and proposals - with less and less frequency, rather than as a task management system. Perhaps earlier in the project, during our daily planning sessions filled with initialed post-its (a system also deemed inefficient), it made more sense to use a tool like Trello to organize tasks. While I don't think communication tech directly mirrors organizational structure, it is much easier to encourage the use of specific tools when a daily, IRL infrastructure supports them. This, too, however cannot come from the top down - we have to try several forms, people have to find a planning structure they like, otherwise it will crumble when it's no longer enforced by a few people.\n\nMy concern lies in that I am not sure exactly where our organizational planning is getting done. With the Piccianello events approaching, I can only find a few documents scattered on the drive detailing its organization. While I'm certain that it's in brilliant hands, if this is an event to be reiterated in several locations, the record of its progress - how Piccianello came to be, as an idea and logistically - is quite unclear externally. We face a similar case with unMon in-a-box - our correspondence has sprawled across several formats, and now we face the task of compiling it into wikis. This could be inevitable, but one benefit from improving our communication channels, by degrees, could be that we no longer need to act as historians to our own work. This is a much more compelling case to me than the need to improve our signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nThat said - my initial, light suggestion would be to move away from the proprietary formats for tech we already use, perhaps prototyping the open source version of Vanilla forums @nathanairplane <a href=\"/t/unmon-in-a-box-it-infrastructure/2928/3\" target=\"_blank\">mentioned</a> and start from there to plug in APIs for other formats we come to find useful. I'd be happy to start using this, and see if it catches on.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-19 12:13:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:16.562870", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 522, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 25.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2161], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20238, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 5714, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Very interesting indeed.

Hopefully it gives you a peek inside the very personal experience of being part of a sort of grand thing \u2013 a network of people becoming active in the healthcare provision chain and caring for each other despite not having met. \u00a0</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Noemi:</strong> <strong>Introduce us to the time when the cytostatics network came about. Was someone ill able or unable to access treatment from healthcare providers? How did they go by?</strong>\n\n<strong>Sabina</strong>: It was the fall of 2009 when it all started for me: the dizziness, the fatigue, trouble breathing, walking, doing\u00a0 basically anything. In October, I just put it on my crazy life style: mother of two, finishing the PhD, teaching at the Music University.\n\n\u00a0In November it was clear something else was going on. So I went to a private lab- the thought of a state hospital was too scary- and had a blood work done. Except it did not work the usual way: the results could not be read due to a strange characteristic of the sample.\n\nI knew it was a bad sign, so I turned to my adoptive grandmother, dr. Mirjam Bercovici. <ins cite=\"mailto:N\" datetime=\"2016-07-24T10:03\">S</ins>he figured it out in minutes, wrote me a recommendation letter and sent me to a real hospital. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia \u2013 a very rare blood disease- was confirmed and three years of fighting it in Romania and Austria followed.\n\n<strong>How did she know and how does this relate to the problems of cytostatics in Romania?</strong>\n\nFor many years, Mirjam, a hematologist, was the chief of the Pediatric Department in the oncologic ward of the biggest hospital in Romania: Fundeni. She was now long retired, but still having nightmares about kids who could not be saved. Because, you see, even though the treatment had clear indications about when and how to give the medicines, they were not always available. The doctors in her section did miracles. Curing cancer without the necessary drugs is indeed a miracle. The always missed some important dose, they could not offer the kids the standard treatment their colleagues in the West were used to. It was the communist era and everything was very difficult, even for the most important health care center in the country.\n\nSo when she sent me there, she knew that I would receive the best possible care, but she was also aware of the limitations of a poor system, as populated with amazing doctors as it was.\n\nDuring my time in Fundeni, I spent lots of time with people dealing with forms of blood cancer. I was \u201clucky\u201d: only had to buy once dexamethason\u00a0for myself, but they were not so lucky:\u00a0 either filling tones of papers to get the newest drugs (the usual line was: we are giving to you, but only with \u201dthe dossier\u201d), either they had to figure out how to obtain certain medication themselves.\n\nBut two bone morrow aspirations and numerous transfusions later, when my condition worsened, there were talks about a treatment\u00a0 reserved for Hodgkin's lymphoma, Mabthera, or Rituximab. Rituximab was not approved in AutoImmune Hemolytic Anemia in Romania at that time. It still isn\u2019t.\n\n<strong>Was anyone inside hospitals listening or fighting back?</strong>\n\nThe situation was rather strange. The drug was expensive, not approved for my AIHA, but\u00a0available in theory. My roommates\u00a0 with Lymphoma could get it based on the dossier (so not standard). But they were missing other drugs, cheaper cytostatics like Bleomicin, compensated 100% from the state! It was like in the times when Mirjam Bercovici was active, all over again. Like nothing had changed in 40 years. Frustration was working both sides, because treatments sessions were postponed, sick people and doctors being equally worried.\n\nAll I knew was that doctors advised patients to figure out how to get the drugs. I had no idea how the people got it, as I was preoccupied with my own, at that time unsolvable, health issues.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bded37e36f49f69a333631a40e306029068e345e.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Tell us how</strong><strong style=\"line-height: 1.7;\">\u00a0one would send or get medicine, about the network and how it worked. Were people afraid of the (il)legality of all this?</strong>\n\nDrained both mentally and financially, I moved to Vienna, became self employed, paid a high tax on healthcare, tried Rituximab with very little success, worked throughout my illness and also got a splenectomy when a terrible\u00a0 relapse made it clear there is no other way out of this. A few months after, I read an article on a website: How I became a member in the cytostatic network. There were many similarities with my struggle: people not having access to medication as cheap as dexamethason, a description of the oldest Pharmacy in Vienna, which I knew so well, and most of all, the solidarity.\u00a0\n\nA few weeks later though, I joined the network of Cytostatics.\u00a0 I was going home for a concert and my good friend Simona Tache shared a status form a Youngman\u00a0who asked if someone is going to Bucharest from Vienna. I knew exactly what it was about, the dots were easy to connect.\n\nI met Vlad Voiculescu that evening, and the next day I followed the instructions and took the\u00a0 transport to Bucharest. Basically, transportation worked like this: You take the medicines in a thermal bag, put it in the fridge and take them out only when you leave the house for the airport. At the security, you take it out and tell the officers you have sensitive medicine there. Sometime they ask you who is it for, sometimes they don\u2019t. You are only allowed to have it for your self or\u00a0 your family. For me, anyone suffering in Romania is family\u2026.so it never felt like lying.\n\nIn Bucharest, you had Valeriu waiting for you at the airport, or you met him later in the day. Valeriu is a taxi driver who delivers the cytostatics to the Pavel Association \u2013 a NGO working for the children in Fundeni, or directly to the ones in need, sick people or caregivers. The news about the Network circulated by word of mouth. Some people knew about its existence, some didn\u2019t. The only thing they knew is that there is someone in Vienna who buys medicines if you give him the prescription and that you can pay him when you can. There was no financial gain, on the contrary. Vlad would receive the prescriptions, buy the cytostatics out of his own pocket and then got the money later. Or much later. No deadlines, no pressure. Just the will to help.\n\n<strong>Were all members sufferers or family of sufferers? Was anybody other than Vlad in charge?</strong>\n\nWhen the article about the Network emerged, over 300 people joined the network through the website medicamente-lipsa.ro and found ways to bring home what was missing. Not all of them had sick members of their families. For most, it was just the little they could do in this horrible situation. The website was Med-Alert \u2018s Association\u2019 initiative, where Vlad is a founder, and there were more people involved in obtaining the cytostatics and other medicines. Still, Vlad is the one who got the dice rolling. He has the gift of inspiring others to do good, and it\u2019s contagious. Even though the majority of people involved did not now about each other, and many still do not know until this day, as little contact between the carriers of the medicines has happened. Still, the ones who met in real life bonded immediately and I will always state that the main gain of the Network was the amazing friendships resulting from it.\n\n<strong>How did things eventually change and what\u2019s the situation so far?</strong>\n\nAfter the article on Hotnews about the Network, a\u00a0high number of interviews with the authorities filled the tv news evening after evening. The situation was indeed outrageous: you pay the taxes, you have medicine 100% compensated by the state because you pay those taxes, but when it comes to it, they are nowhere available in Romania, and you have to buy them outside the country.\u00a0 Cornered by jurnalists, the Minister of Health made hundreds of promises, with some results. Things were sometimes better, and sometimes worse. <em>The whole System in itself acted like a cancer: remissions and relapses.</em>\n\nAt the moment, Vlad Voiculescu is the new Minister of Health. After a tragic event in October 2015, known as the <ins cite=\"mailto:Muzicel%20donose\" datetime=\"2016-07-25T12:07\"><a href=\"/t/when-mass-protests-can-barely-begin-to-solve-it/4923\">Colectiv fire</a></ins>, where 64 people died, the whole Government was changed and a lot of young \u2013 under 45- dynamic people were named in key positions.\n\nOne of the actions that Vlad took in the short period of time he\u2019s been in charge is to make a\u00a0smart alliance with\u00a0 more countries: Bulgaria, Moldova, Croatia, Latvia, Macedonia, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and Slovakia,\u00a0 in order to get better access to medication. More countries means more people, so a much\u00a0 bigger market, a fact that would discourage the Pharma companies to ignore it by withdrawing a medicine\u00a0 by citing\u00a0 small numbers in sales.\n\n<strong>What do you think was the reason for people to participate so actively? If it were another problem and not a deadly disease, would they mobilize as much?</strong><a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>\n\nThe Public opinion in Romania is, unfortunately, used to crises and bad situation concerning healthcare. The media is full of fundraising events for children or young people who need to get treatment abroad, the news are full of reports of malfunctions of the healthcare system.\n\nIn all this mess, there will always be people willing to contribute in any way to the wellbeing of others.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e566a4833cb770e310baf5a297336ea4dab4eee8.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"499\">\n\nBut maybe the reason of this high rate participation in the network of cytostatics is older than we think, with roots in the communist era. Back then, there was a solution for everything: from lack of food to lack of clothes. Everyone knew someone who could help. The only area not available for this kind of help was healthcare. Both doctors and patients were helpless against a system that didn\u2019t truly provide for its beneficiaries. So people developed a true phobia of hospitals, seen as horrible places, dirty and dangerous, a place where some medical act was provided, but where the family took care of the sick person in the most common sense of the term: from bed sheets to food and hygiene products.

It was organised by SIDA\u00a0 and Julia Gruppen (especially Marcin De Kaminski, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/dekaminski\">@dekaminski</a>) and gave participants a much appreciated opportunity to discuss experiences, challenges and opportunities, with a special focus on the developments in the Middle East and North Africa. It was an intense day, and what follows is one of two long posts on the discussions and reflections that took place during the event\u2026\n\nThe accounts of Salma Said (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/salmasaid\">@salmasaid</a>), Sultan Al Qassemi (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/SultanAlQassemi\">@sultanAlQassemi</a>), Maryam Al Khawaja (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/MARYAMALKHAWAJA\">@MARYAMALKHAWAJA</a>), Dima Khatib (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/Dima_Khatib\">@dima_khatib</a>),\u00a0 Sarrah Abdelrahman (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/sarrahsworld\">@sarrahsworld</a>) and Hamza Fakhr, Jacob Appelbaum (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/ioerror\">@ioerror</a>) and many others are a reminder to appreciate how fortunate I am to be able to work on affecting change without having to put life or limbs on the line, and that this exception is a delicate and fragile one worth fighting to keep and afford to others. Because the \u201cothers\u201d could be you or me, good people just trying to get on with our lives and fix what\u2019s broken in our world. It is increasingly clear how intimately our ability, or inability,\u00a0 to do so is linked to technology.\n\n<blockquote>\u201cWell we have a dictator and we need him away, we need your help\u201d \u2013 Phonecall to Telecomix- Stephan Urbach,\n\n</blockquote>From Jacob Appelbaum I learned that \u201cSecurity\u201d and \u201cprivacy\u201d are simplifications of complex interactions between people and technologies- and the underlying expectations are seldom expressed more than in abstract. If the underlying expectations are unrealistic or based on false information, it follows that we end up with bad laws. Like Jacob and many others, I am concerned that the laws and policies regarding surveillance are undermining not only the integrity of the decisions we make online as consumers; they are undermining our ability to be active and engaged citizens without fear of threats and harassment as individuals.\u00a0 Jacob states that a lot of people tend to associate the discussion about surveillance with censorship in dictatorships, and engage in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other#The_idea_of_the_Other\">othering</a> it; falsely assuming that unlike in dictatorships elsewhere in the world, in our (western) democracies we have nothing to fear from surveillance ;\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\u201cFor example, Sweden is trying right now to jail <a href=\"http://blog.brokep.com/about/\">Peter Sunde</a> . He\u2019s a friend of mine and it\u2019s funny because I feel sort of aligned with him. He\u2019s kind of a dissident in Sweden in kind of the same way that I have become accidentally in the United States. The united States says hey everybody, we care about democracy and freedom. We care about activists having an emergency button to destroy the contents of their cell phone. And then we get met by military people at the airports. Or they try to jail us for speaking. Or for helping people in these other countries.\n\nSo it\u2019s important to remember that while we want to help people abroad, we should look to the local communities and contexts that we have and figure that jailing Peter maybe, is exactly the wrong thing. And its wrong for exactly the same reasons as it\u2019s wrong when someone tries to jail Sarah in Egypt.\u201d\n\n</blockquote>Because of the ways our communications infrastructure is built,\u00a0it is not feasible to expect technology users to have knowledge in order to be able to do the right and safe thing. The Internet is a massive surveillance system, as are mobile phones- the more we use them the more they surveil us- and often <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/04/iphone-tracks/\">without our knowledge or permission</a> . The Web browser is no longer just a tool to access the web,\u00a0 it is now a means by which our online behavior is packeted and sold as a product to entities that collect massive amounts of data about what we do on the web. This allows things like <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703294904575385532109190198.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">shops selling you a product at a higher price than your neighbor because they think they know you earn more, or a bank refusing to lend you money to buy a house because you visited online poker sites</a> \u2013 without you being aware it is happening or being able to control it. <a href=\"http://copyriot.se/2011/10/26/anteckningar-fran-net4change/#comments\">Copyriot</a> reasons that this also applies to Browsers built with open source software, since they too adapt to current web standards and are riddled with scripts that compromise security.\n\n<blockquote>\u201cDo you know why vendors don\u2019t make good privacy decisions for users? It\u2019s because you are their product.\u201d- Jacob Appelbaum\n\n</blockquote>Through methods such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_%28computing%29\">Backdoors</a> and DNS filtering, a variety of stakeholders can change the contents of our actions online and attribute things we have not done or said to us or at least skew them out of context with potentially devastating consequences for us: remember a little white lie you might have told to avoid hurting someone\u2019s feelings or to avoid causing trouble for them- what if that were presented as proof of your dishonesty say by an insurance company trying to get out of compensating you ten years down the line? Or an an ironic remark sent in a private message to a friend who understood the context then and there, being revealed to others in an entirely different context by someone wanting to write you off as a bigot?\u00a0 Entities that maintain and build our infrastructures, especially private actors that sell surveillance, cannot be trusted to protect our privacy because\u00a0 the information we would like to keep to ourselves is their most valuable product.\n\n<blockquote>\u201cIf we don\u2019t want to do everything, we need to transfer technological knowledge &amp; tools to non-geeks.\u201d Stephan Urbach, Telecomix\n\n</blockquote>Our institutions and laws are too slow to adopt and evolve to protect us against unscrupulous behavior by actors that put profits or political agendas before people; any attempts at regulation that require us to trust some or another entity to voluntarily sacrifice potential profits in order to protect our privacy are bound to fail. By extension any policy that is based on the premises that a user is knowledgeable of, and can be held accountable for what goes on in the networks she uses, is one that puts the individual at risk from those who might wish to silence her from exercising her democratic rights. Both in <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,790944,00.html\">Europe</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-31/iranian-police-seizing-dissidents-get-aid-of-western-companies.html\">beyond</a>.\n\n<em>SO, What can we you or I do about it ?</em>\n\nJacob suggests a combination of changes in policy and in how we behave online. On the policy side he suggests that our policymakers demand data from vendors on how how network monitoring/CALEA systems are compromised and to reject <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawful_interception#Illegal_use\">lawful interception</a>. His advice to users is to contextualise our security arrangements [how? got links?] our\u00a0 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging\">OTR</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cdt.org/policy/role-privacy-design-protecting-consumer-privacy#1\">Privacy by design</a>\u00a0 (as opposed to Privacy enhancing technologies) and widespread adoption of <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">TOR</a>.\n\nStephan Urbach (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/herrurbach\">@herrurbach</a>) stresses the need for disseminating knowledge about technology to non-geeks. Know of any initatives, maybe your own maybe someone you know, that are active in this?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-02 11:21:48", "updated_at": "2017-09-13 23:23:31.059234", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1409, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31157, "user_id": 2169, "topic_id": 2921, "post_number": 31, "raw": "<b>Coming to Tblisi!</b>\n\nLooking forward to being there in person June 24-26.

No major ilnesses, no important injuries, skeleton still intect.

I suspect this is\u00a0has been critical in keeping me going: not smoking, drinking very moderately, watching my weight, not doing drugs, not doing junk food, exercising regularly. I have my own ideas as to how you could motivate people to do that. Is this off topic or do we talk about it?</li>\n\n<li><strong>vaccination</strong>. Done that - and never caught TBC.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>diagnosis and treatment of minor diseases</strong> like flu (sorry, Lucas - I know it can be a killer). My immune system seems to work quite well: flu for me is generally not more than a couple of days of feeling tired and in a bad mood. Each three or four years I get fever and treat it with aspirin and the like. A few times in my life I had to resort to antibiotics, especially as a child.</li>\n\n</ul>The good news is that all if this stuff can be quite resilient, because it does not require large facilities and doctors with ten years of training. It does require cheap pharmaceuticals. So perhaps a resilient system would involve a knowledge base around the basic stuff like flu that can be transferred to a few people in each community with some very basic training; and no-patent cheap drugs (painkillers, antibiotics etc.) or, even better, a knowledge base to make your own from raw materials readily available in nature. Everything that looks non-standard is passed on to some real-deal doctor, but screening out the basic stuff would, I suspect, reduce a lot the load on the health care system.

Many people think the problem is now income, rather than employment.\n\nWhat I think about this is not particularly important: it s a fascinating topic, but not one that I ever thought I could make a difference, even a small one, about. Since you ask: it seems to me that the numbers add up in the aggregate, i.e. we are now producing enough wealth to be supporting everyone in a dignified lifestyle (by \"everyone\" I mean everyone in the West, conveniently leaving it to the Chinese state to move 300 million people away from subsistence agriculture and illiteracy and over to the cities). But the redistributive plumbing is not there, and I really don't see how we could build it by democratic means.\n\nBasic income just makes sense. At a social level, it has zero cost, because people need to eat and take shelter anyway, and I don't notice anybody starving or freezing to death in the Netherlands. Even the poorest eat more or less every day, and they go to sleep somewhere at night. With basic income, the resources to do so would come from the State rather than others (charitable organizations, or families in the case of\u00a0 young people); not much difference, it is the same population supporting the same poors, with the added value of more human dignity and a better sense of security. I have even argued that <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2012/02/16/basic-income-as-innovation-policy/\">basic income might be regarded as innovation policy</a>: promise a young person her bills will be paid for a year or two, and that person will (with some probability) use the time to build something of value: voluntary work, a company, a work of art. No brainer, right? Wrong, apparently.\n\nIt would be incredibly important to get beyond the job paradigm. Realistically, however, I don't see it happening any time soon - unless by the semi-autonomous nomadic tribes imagined by Bruce Sterling in his visionary book <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2011/10/07/338518/the-book-that-predicts-occupy-wall-street-bruce-sterlings-distraction/?mobile=nc\">Distraction</a> (recommended).

Known locally as the Acholi Quarter, Kireka hill is also home to one of the city\u2019s largest stone quarries, which offers low paid and back-breaking employment to hundreds of traumatized hillside residents.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Twenty five years ago, the local king of the Buganda tribe offered Kireka hill to the Acholi people who were fleeing from the north for as long as they needed a safe place to stay. Since the rebel attacks stopped seven years ago, the people here have been trying to figure out how to scrape together enough resources to move their families home. In mid 2013, Acholi Quarter residents were informed that the hill they are living on has been sold for commercial development. Though going home is what they have dreamed of, that hope is now infused with the very real fear that these fragile families will once again be forcibly displaced. \u00a0In recent months there has been some unrest\u2026. it\u2019s really time to go home.</span>\n\n<span>Once a week, 35 women who live in the Acholi Quarter gather at the small Life in Africa (LiA) community center near the bottom of the hill. They bring in products made from paper beads to fill orders from abroad and to sell at their small community shop.

Come help <a href=\"http://wp.me/p2aFKl-8b\">here</a></li>\n\n<li><strong>Housing:</strong> Empty spaces exist but community members have no access to them as  landlords/owners prefer to keep them empty for various reasons.

How could we even make a business from it?

How do we manage to get around language barriers so people do not feel alienated in their home; what possibilities are there in the Kiez to pick up a new language and have fun? Why does this matter at all? Discuss <a href=\"http://wp.me/p2aFKl-8P\">here</a></li>\n\n<li><strong>Sanitation and Hygiene:</strong> Someone mentioned that not everyone in the hood has access to proper sanitation.

I was in town to do a presentation on \"The Rise of the Citizen Expert\" with Alberto Cottica as part of Social Media Week in Berlin. Susa and I had discussed the situation on numerous occations also because I have a special relationship with it. This city hosts many people I have come to love; over time it has become my second home, but I have always been hesitant to really move there because of the work situation. With <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.de/money/20120802-44133.html\" title=\"\">property prices in the capital having risen by nearly 40% between 2003 and 2011</a>, it is clear that unless creative ways can be found to better share the city, many of its less affluent residents will eventually be driven out. Some are reacting by blaming the tourists and bohemian hipsters and openly showing their rage ...\n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/16116523?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\n\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/16116523\">Offending the Clientele</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/retsina\">Sender FN / Retsina-Film</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI am not sure that placing the blame on newcomers alone is really fair or constructive. The existing residents are themselves partially responsible for the social exclusion of others; as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_%26_the_City\">China Mieville puts it</a>,<em> all city-dwellers collude in ignoring real aspects of the cities in which they live \u2014 the homeless, political structures, the commercial world or the stuff that\u2019s \u2018for the tourists\u2019</em> .... In a community where there are underlying tensions we need ways of constructively raising to the surface conflicts of interest between different community members. Rather than approaching this head on in terms of unmet needs one way of doing this is by surfacing the perception and the potential in terms of well-being in the community. To do this kind of work requires a sense of shared responsibility. And awareness of others sharing the same physical spaces .\n\nSusa wants to explore sustainable ways of using her knowledge and hands on skills in goldsmithing, product design and yoga to build community projects that fight social exclusion and poverty in her neighborhood. But together is better :) So this weekend we organised a workshop to find others who also live in the area that are also interested in finding creative ways of <a href=\"http://sharingthecity.com/\"> sharing the city</a>.\n\nIt was fun: we met some lovely people and got to know about a lot of interesting initiatives going on already! I'll write more about it as a comment as soon as I've synthesised my thoughts and impressions (hopefully later tonight). On another level the process of doing this got me thinking about the future of Edgeryders now that we are coming to the end of the first iteration...I know from many conversations we have been having during and after \\#lote and \\#edgecamp that more community members also want to move towards actionables. How could we improve the platform so it better facilitates our helping one another, p2p, to realise or support existing initiatives that contribute towards happier, healthier and more inclusive cities for everyone?
