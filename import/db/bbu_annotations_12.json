Molly realised, because this was the second disembodied finger she'd seen today, that both this finger and the previous finger, were specific fingers. One was an index finger and the other was a so-called ring finger. They clearly belonged to the same hand. Questions abounded. The happy doggy was dissuaded by Molly to pick the finger back up within its mouth and moved along the riverbank, with its equally happy owner, leaving Molly behind with the digit. Molly wondered, if the fingers came from the same hand, how had they been disassociated from it? Was the hand still attached to the arm? Why were the fingers not in the same location, unless the happy doggy was unusually selective? And why was it that no one was alarmed by fingers anymore? The war had been some time ago and the depredations it had visited upon the village were minor. There were stories of what the occupying powers did to the local women who refused to 'co-operate' with them, but they were not at all related to the severing of fingers. Molly looked up at the mountain and thought of what might be an apocryphal fact. Yakuza members cut their own fingers off when dishonoured. That had nothing to do with this!
