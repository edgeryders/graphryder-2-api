Our contribution consisted in helping them set up a citizen innovation network, where all strata of society \u2013 not just artists or culture professionals \u2013 pooled ingenuity and resources to make Matera into place humming with human creativity. \n\nPeople responded with passion and skills, because that's what people do when given the chance. They organised activities around data, [coding for thousands of children](https://youtu.be/mxd9SlmWrqM) and green energy. They [walked for weeks from village to village](https://youtu.be/yNfM8K5_3v4) onto Matera, to let everybody know that the whole region supported the city and wanted to be a part of the Capital of Culture project. They switched off public lighting and replaced it with [tens of thousands of candles](https://youtu.be/RXSjEEbChGs). They reclaimed public spaces, such as [never-completed railways](https://youtu.be/3BrrDW55L5o). In all this, the [unMonastery](https://youtu.be/O3t2MRB-rn8) \u2013 a residency programme for hackers and social innovators \u2013 stood as an exciting new model for a city to build international relationship around civic innovation. \n\nThe city did win the title. In late 2014 it was proclaimed European Capital of Culture for 2019 amidst an [explosion of joy](https://youtu.be/tG9r51QhY98). \n\nAfter the celebration came a long and difficult reorganisation. A Matera 2019 Foundation was rolled out. Staff was hired and office space was reclaimed. Now, the city feels it is time to re-open the door to bottom-up initiatives. The Foundation has involved Edgeryders in designing and animating a community supporting people that want to create projects to contribute to Matera 2019's programme. Fostering new creative partnership between Matera locals and other people and groups, both in the region and all across Europe and the Mediterranean, is part of the remit of this new community. \n\nLook out for updates on this front, and be ready to get involved.

Steps for Edgeryders O\u00dc](#heading--4)**\n\n------\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\">1. Introduction</h2>\n\n**Process overview.** Edgeryders' decentralized accounting happens on [edgeryders.freeagent.com](https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/). Every regular collaborator has an account there, using it to request all their payments from Edgeryders. This refers to both payments for invoices (when you invoice for your services on a contractual basis) and payments for the reimbursements of expenses (treated [here](/t/id/9078)).\n\n**No urgent payment requests, please.** Make your payment requests early, because we don't want to hurry our process for \"emergencies\". (We will do so to avoid formidable catastrophes, but we will be annoyed :smiley:) Your regular payment request needs up to a few days to be authorized by your project manager, until the Monday after for the payment to be made, and the usual time for bank transfers for the payment to arrive. (One bank working day to EU / SEPA countries, more to others.)\n\n**The process documented below is our suggestion for the default process.** Project managers are largely free to organize their projects as they want, so they _can_ choose a different process, esp. with good reasons. The only constant element is that bills have to end up in FreeAgent together with the \"AUTHORIZED\" note by the project manager (see below), because that is the interface to the Edgeryders payment manager.\n\n**Complain early about bad process.** Whether it's the default process documented below or a different one chosen by your project manager \u2013 if it works badly, it is your duty to complain early so that adaptations can be made before a project becomes an unenjoyable mess. Remember, it's never the person, it's always the process that is at fault. :)\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Steps for regular collaborators</h2>\n\nFollow the steps in all sub-sections, in the order they appear. The first three sub-sections are only relevant for the setup, during the first time you submit a bill.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. Setup: Get a Dynalist account</h3>\n\nFollow our [Dynalist Manual](/t/id/7618), section \"2. Getting started with Dynalist\". This will give you access to the \"Edgeryders Tasks\" dynalist, which you will need in the process below.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. Setup: Get a FreeAgent account</h3>\n\nAsk an Edgeryders director (preferably @matthias, @alberto, @noemi, otherwise also @johncoate or @nadia) to create a FreeAgent account for you. Just message them here on the platform and include your full name, e-mail address and if you need to send reimbursement requests or also invoices. Once your account has been created, you will receive an automated notification e-mail with an activation link to set your account password.\n\n(_Note to directors:_ Only Edgeryders directors can create FreeAgent accounts as creating FreeAgent accounts requires permission level 7 \"Tax, Accounting & Users\". To create the account, go to \"[user menu \u2192 Settings \u2192 Users](https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/company/users)\". Set the new account to permission level 2 \"My Money\" for reimbursements only or 5 \"Invoices, Estimates & Files\" for reimbursements and invoices.)\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-3\">2.3. Setup: Add your payment info</h3>\n\n[Log in](https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/login), find your name under \"[main menu \u2192 Contacts](https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/contacts)\", and click on it.  Add a \"Note\" and add your bank account data there. It should look like this:\n\n> Bank account information\n> `-------------------`\n> account holder: \n> bank name: \n> bank address: \n> account currency: EUR\n> IBAN: \n> BIC / SWIFT: \n\nThe currency of the bank account should be included so we can decide on the payment method that offers the lowest fees. For non-EU bank accounts, replace the IBAN line with your account number and sort code, or whatever your national bank account scheme uses.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-4\">2.4. Write your invoice</h3>\n\n**Invoice template.** You can copy or download [our invoice template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uTZl6ZC-zJSDsQY9-sdmGkv762ECcI5HytktNk9cshE) and fill in your information, or put the same information into your own template. The EU provides [a good overview](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/eu-vat-rules-topic/vat-invoicing-rules_en) of all regulations that apply to information required on invoices.\n\n**No cross-project invoices.** In one invoice, only invoice for services provided for one Edgeryders project. Otherwise we can't properly add it to our accounting software.\n\n**VAT amount.** In almost all cases, the correct way is to put zero VAT on your invoice. Details: The VAT to include depends on what type of supplier you are, and your country of residence. Good authoritative sources of information are (from simple articles up to the full portal):\n\n* [europa.eu: Cross-border VAT](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/taxation/vat/cross-border-vat/index_en.htm)\n\n* [europa.eu: VAT invoicing rules](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/eu-vat-rules-topic/vat-invoicing-rules_en)\n\n* [europa.eu: Where to tax?](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/eu-vat-rules-topic/where-tax_en#supply_services)\n\n* [europa.eu: VAT Portal](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat_en)\n\nThe major cases are:\n\n* **Add no VAT** if you are invoicing for **any services from a member state** of the European Union except Estonia (where Edgeryders O\u00dc is registered). Edgeryders will apply the reverse charge procedure for this case (see below). This applies independently of what type of service is considered (electronic, digitally supplied, or not) and where the service is provided (in the country of the service provider, of the customer, or another country). Source:\n\n    > The place of taxation is determined by where the services are supplied. [\u2026] The supply of services between businesses (B2B services) is in principle taxed at the customer's place of establishment. ([source](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/eu-vat-rules-topic/where-tax_en))\n\n    There are some **exceptions** from this rule, [documented here](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/eu-vat-rules-topic/where-tax_en). The most relevant cases from there are for us:\n\n    * > **B2B and B2C restaurant and catering services**, other than those supplied on board ships, aircraft or trains during the section of a passenger transport effected within the EU, are taxed at the place where the services are physically carried out [Article 55 of the [VAT Directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32006L0112)]\n\n    * > **B2B services in respect of admission to** cultural, artistic, sporting, scientific, educational, entertainment and similar **events** will be taxed at the place where those events actually take place [Article 53 of the [VAT Directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32006L0112)]\n\n    (**What are services anyway?** In general, consider anything a service that is not just about selling a physical product, or a product and its installation. Catering is a service. Not sure if a print job is a service. We did not yet find any official EU definition of \"service\".)\n\n* **Add no VAT** if you are invoicing for **services from outside the European Union**. Relevant so-called \"authoritative\" information has been found [here](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/taxation/vat/cross-border-vat/index_en.htm#shortcut-13-buying-services-from-outside-the-eu):\n\n    > If you receive services for business purposes from a supplier based outside the EU, you should usually pay VAT at the applicable rate in your country, as if you had supplied the service yourself (using the reverse charge procedure).\n    >\n    > You can usually deduct this amount later on when you make your VAT declaration.\n\n    It does not matter if the services are \"[digital services](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-vat-rules-if-you-supply-digital-services-to-private-consumers#defining-electronically-supplied)\" or not, that distinction is only relevant for B2C sales.\n\n* **Add no VAT** if you are invoicing for **physical goods from a member state** of the European Union except Estonia **and you send the goods across a border** ([source](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/taxation/vat/cross-border-vat/index_en.htm#withintheeusellgoodsanotherbusiness)). To write us an invoice without VAT for this case, you need to include our VAT ID: `EE101972833`.\n\n* **Add no VAT** if you are invoicing for **physical goods from outside the European Union** and **you send the goods across a border**. This is an import / export trade, where usually no local VAT is applied but we'll have to pay EU import VAT at the point of customs.\n\n* **Add your country's VAT** if you are invoicing for **physical goods from a member state** of the European Union except Estonia **and you do not send the goods across a border** (derived from [here](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/taxation/vat/cross-border-vat/index_en.htm#withintheeusellgoodsanotherbusiness)). Example: Edgeryders ordered a print job in Belgium, for delivery inside Belgium. In this case, Edgeryders O\u00dc will not be able to get the VAT back, as we are not registered in Belgium.\n\n* **Add your country's VAT** if you are invoicing for **physical goods from outside the European Union** and **you do not send the goods across a border**. For example, when we purchase items in person in your shop.\n\n* **Add 20% Estonian VAT** if you are a company **registered in Estonia** and your company is not exempt from VAT.\n\n**Reverse charge info.** If you are invoicing Edgeryders from outside Estonia for services, Edgeryders O\u00dc is liable for the VAT payment due to the [reverse charge procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_value_added_tax#Intra-Community_acquisition). [According to EU rules](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/eu-vat-rules-topic/vat-invoicing-rules_en), you must include the following additional information on your invoice:\n\n* The VAT ID of Edgeryders O\u00dc: `EE101972833`\n* The words \"reverse charge\". Embedded in a sentence of your choice, if you want.\n\nDue to reverse charge, in these cases the VAT amount does not depend on the VAT status of your business: you zero-rate VAT on the invoice and Edgeryders will pay (and get back) Estonian VAT corresponding to your invoiced amount.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-5\">2.5. Submit your invoice for payment</h3>\n\nFor that, you have to add your invoice in FreeAgent (there called \"bill\") and create a Dynalist task for its authorization:\n\n1. **Go to \"Bills \u2192 [Add New Bill](https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/bills/new) in FreeAgent.** (In detail: click on \"[Bills](https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/bills)\" in the FreeAgent main menu, then on the \"Add new bill\" button in the top right.)\n\n2. **Fill into \"Supplier Contact\"** your name, selected from the dropdown.\n\n3. **Fill into \"Reference\"** the number or reference on your own invoice. This is needed to facilitate auditing of accounting data. \n\n4. Fill into \"Comments\" a short description of the services you performed, for example: \"_community management_\". Usually, do not include the project name, as it will be included in its own field already.\n\n4. **Fill in the \"Bill Date\".** Usually you leave it as it is, the default being the present day. However, if you created your invoice in the past, fill in that day of course.\n\n5. **Fill in the \"Due Date\".** Set it to the current date (where you upload the invoice to FreeAgent) to indicate that your invoice is due immediately. Otherwise, if you leave it at the default \"invoice date plus one month\": that's nice of you as it means you are ok with us paying you a month later :wink: \n\n6. **Fill into \"Total Value\"** the invoice amount in Euros. If your invoice is in a different currency,  convert the total to Euros. For that, use the [X-Rates Historic Lookup tool](http://www.x-rates.com/historical/) with the date of your invoice. Keep the link of your conversion, you need it later. (Other suitable but less great tools: [XE Historical Currency Rates](http://www.xe.com/currencytables/) and [ECB Currency Converter](https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/curConverter.do).)\n\n7. **Fill in the contained Estonian VAT amount** that is contained in your invoice. The field will default to 0% VAT and ***0% is almost always the right value***. Because this field is _only for Estonian VAT_, not for example for Nepali VAT in case Edgeryders purchased a physical product from you inside Nepal.\n\n8. **Select in \"Category\"** the entry \"Cost of Sales \u2192 Collaborators\". (:warning: This is important since it has affects if Edgeryders can deduct the expense from its taxable profits.)\n\n9. **Fill into \"Comments\"** relevant additional information about the bill, if any.\n\n    * If your original currency is not Euro, include the link to the conversion you did. It has to include the date, and if possible the amount ([example](http://www.x-rates.com/historical/?from=USD&amount=2000&date=2017-11-01)).\n\n    * If for some reason you want your invoice to be paid later, make this very visible by putting something like \"NOT TO BE PAID IN 2018\" at the beginning of the comment (and also adapt the \"Due Date\" field accordingly).\n\n10. **Select in \"Link to Project\"** the entry for the project you are working on.\n\n11. **Leave the default \"This Bill recurs\" value** which is \"Does not recur\".\n\n12. **Upload in \"Attachment\"** the file of your invoice in PDF file format.\n\n    If your invoice is about a Horizon 2020 project, note that it has to include a timesheet, according to [this process](/t/id/9143) (in there, section \"2.2. Creating an invoice for your worktime\").\n\n13. **Click on \"Create and Finish\".**\n\n14. **Create a Dynalist task for authorization.** Visit the \"[Core: Administration \u2192 Current: Payment Tasks](https://dynalist.io/d/7aI9WsBWMMgCS2aablD9uIjT#z=bZgNg9EixfYlw1nIYBNjhM-3)\" node in Dynalist and add a task there according to this example:\n\n    > !(2018-12-01) Approve https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/bills/123456 . #matthias\n\n    The task has to contain, in this order:\n\n    * **A deadline.** Usually the next Sunday, because Monday is our payment day. Enter the deadline by pressing <kbd>!</kbd> and choosing it from the popup.\n    * **A task text with link to the FreeAgent bill.** To find that link in FreeAgent, go to \"Bills\", right-click on the reference corresponding to your bill, and choose \"Copy link address\".\n    * **An assignment to your project manager.** This is a `#tag` using the edgeryders.eu username of your project manager, for example `#matthias` to assign to @matthias. Our system makes sure that your project manager is automatically notified of the new task.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Steps for occasional collaborators</h2>\n\nThis is a simplified process for collaborators who will, as far as it can be foreseen, send us at most three bills in total. It does not need them to get a FreeAgent or Dynalist account, and can also be used by all collaborators while they do not have either a FreeAgent or Dynalist account.\n\n1. **Create your invoice as a PDF.** See the instructions for our regular collaborators ([above](#heading--2-4)) for a template and details about what VAT to charge.\n\n2. **E-mail the invoice to your contact person at Edgeryders.** This is simply the person from Edgeryders who contracted the service from you. They will care to enter it into the Edgeryders accounting system and authorize it, and the Edgeryders payment manager will then pay it.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Steps for Edgeryders O\u00dc</h2>\n\n(If you only wanted to submit your bill to Edgeryders for payment, you can stop reading here. The following is only for staff of Edgeryers O\u00dc.)\n\nThe project manager is the person managing the Edgeryders project to which a bill refers. The payment manager is the Edgeryders management board member executing the payments from the bank account.\n\n1. **Project manager: Make sure you are registered on Dynalist Companion.** Otherwise, you will not get the automatic notifications about new payment authorization tasks for you. See our [Dynalist Manual](/t/id/7618) in section \"4. Get notifications about new tasks\" for instructions.\n\n2. **Project manager: Register the bill in FreeAgent (if needed).** This is only necessary for bills submitted via e-mail by occasional collaborators, our accountants etc.. Everyone else registers it as a bill in FreeAgent themselves. Use the \"steps for regular contributors\" in analogy to register the bill in FreeAgent.\n\n3. **Project manager: Check and approve the bill.** Check that the invoiced service has been delivered, any forex conversion is correct, and that the bill is correctly recorded and linked to your project in FreeAgent. To approve it, edit the bill record in FreeAgent and add to the beginning of the comment field, with the current date and your firstname:\n\n    > (APPROVED _[yyyy-mm-dd]_ by _[name]_)\n\n4. **Project manager: Check off the Dynalist task.** The one that told you to approve the bill.\n\n5. **Payment manager: Pay all approved bills on the next Monday.** But do not just pay blindly: ask the project manager for explanations if there is anything you do not understand.\n\n    You can find all open bills around the top of the \"[Bills](https://edgeryders.freeagent.com/bills)\" page, and see which ones are approved right on that page, without having to visit each bill. Tip: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> and search for \"approved\" to highlight all approved invoices.", "created_at": "2017-10-10 10:08:10.062425", "updated_at": "2020-10-05 10:23:33.883137", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2930, "wiki": true, "reads": 63, "score": 887.4, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791, 5, 3, 3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86579, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 14769, "post_number": 16, "raw": "[quote=\"thom_stewart, post:12, topic:14769\"]\nbeen working on establishing Community Land Trusts in Ireland\n[/quote]\n\nVery curious about this.

At the same time the community is growing at a steady pace, as are the number of projects and collaborations coming out of it. My personal mission (as one of the founders) is to build infrastructure for p2p collaboration around work that is meaningful. Social, organisational, technical, economic and physical. On a global scale. And it seems there is something we are doing right-Just getting something like the unMonastery, a physical space that is inhabited by community members from all over building incredible projects is quite an achievement.\n\nSo the delicate balance lies in harnessing the social media presence to support this mission, and not contributing to wasted energy and attention in facebook and twitter conversations. It requires us to collaborate and share the work of making the platform better, crafting engaging stories about community members and their work, drawing support to various projects so they are more likely to succeed, helping others learn how we get things done and inspiring them to build more amazing things...you get the idea :) It's not something anyone can do alone, it requires us all to help....So we decided to make it easier to help.

Sorry Alberto, I missed your\u00a0comment and noticed it only now. As Alessandro points out the project is divided in several phases.\n\n<strong>In the first phase we want to make it really easy and doable.</strong> So the system will contain lists of foods and their degree of histamine, as for example:\u00a0\n\nCarrots, Broccoli, Fennel = Low Histamine\n\nTomato, Orange, Kiwi = High Histamine\n\nCoffe, Garlic, Grapes =\u00a0sometimes tolerated\n\nThis are informations\u00a0that\u00a0anyone can find online but while at the supermarket or while choosing\u00a0your ice cream flavour, it is handy to have it quickly ready all together in an app.\n\nThe first phase of the app will also contain a list of\u00a0Common symptoms: Headaches, migraines,\u00a0Vertigo, dizziness,\u00a0Abdominal cramps ecc.\n\nAnd it will allow the user to check symptoms and associate them with foods into a diary/calendar system.\n\nThis is handy in case the user wants to reintroduce a food or wants to monitor the effects\u00a0of some food that are sometimes tolerated.\n\nIn the first phase of the app the system will not ask many questions nor give too many informations.\u00a0It will mostly be a structured tool for annotation that will empower the personal\u00a0awareness of the user.\n\nThe app \u201cClue\u201d (menstrual cycle tracking), is a very good example in this terms, it doesn\u2019t\u00a0do much next to allowing women to structurally note down dates and\u00a0symptoms, yet it is a powerful tool of awareness.\u00a0\n\n<strong>The\u00a0data-analisys will only enter \u00a0in the\u00a0second phase.</strong> For this there will be some work to be done to design the interaction between what we find trough the data, the assumptions we already have, our approach on care, and the collaboration with practitioners and medical experts.\u00a0\n\nI\u00a0hope\u00a0that\u00a0I\u00a0have answered your questions and please let me know,\u00a0I am happy to answer if there are more questions.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-29 23:22:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:56.308242", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 399, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5370, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5337, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Sam Muirhead will be shooting video with the OpenCare consortium team members at the times below.

The purpose of this is to build a shared repository of stories, each one embedding strategies for improving health- and social care.

This phase links Op3nCare stories to the social, economic, political and legal context in which they happen: were they enabled by something in particular? Were they hindered by it? What change in could have made the alternative happen, or happen more successfully?

Also i wonder what is the age spectrum of the inhabitants - i personally feel when majority of inhabitants at such a space are in their early-twenties to early thirties (like 22 to 32) - this model might become wobbly (i think such idealistic commerco-residential space needs level headed mature individuals both as inhabitants as well as workers).\n So its not just about the willingness to start (as advised to 'Xavier') but also finding the right people willing to stay / work at such place.\n\n1. I wonder - if people staying in the Reef really have an emotional bond with each other or not. Do they have any sense of belonging-ness towards each other.  I suppose everyone of you might say - \"Yes I like my co-sharing flat-mates\". But is their willingness to spend time together or its more of a once or twice a week formality\n\n1. i am also curious about the ethnic diversity about this prototype and their behaviors. i assume everyone is  Europe-born- bred(??).

This move has had mixed results: many privatization programmes have suffered from unintended consequences \u2013 exhibit A being the creation of a powerful oligarch caste in Russia in a very short time. The general consensus seems to be that it might be interesting to explore new avenues.\n\n----\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/why-we-care-about-stewardship/3460/1?oe=1\n`challenge: state struggle`\n\nOver the centuries, nation states all over the world have developed or acquired control of assets of all kinds. The overarching logic behind their development and acquisition is generally to enable the provision of public services. In recent decades this model has become overstretched: states have found themselves struggling to find the resources to keep those assets manned so that provision of such services could continue, and had to retreat from many non-core services. Consequently, many such assets lie unused; some are beginning to deteriorate. They are extremely varied in nature; many are buildings, gardens, parks. Others are utilities (networks) or even digital assets (data).\n\n----\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/why-we-care-about-stewardship/3460/1?oe=1\n`communities`\n\nCommunities have been singled out as candidates for taking care of some public assets, in particular those that can be used to provide services to the community itself. In at least one European country, the UK, community owned/managed assets have become an important policy issue. For example, plans are emerging that could result in up to 500 public libraries being turned over to local communities, together with seed funding, allowing each local community to find a sustainable operation model for its library or see it die. Locality, alone, has received over 6,500 enquiries from communities that are keen to acquire, develop and/or manage land and buildings over the past 5 years\n\n----\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/why-we-care-about-stewardship/3460/1?oe=1\n`communities`\n\nThe Edgeryders community has accumulated significant experience in this area. Many of us have been experimenting with ways to communally manage diverse assets including: spaces like the unMonastery, digital mesh networks, geographic databases or software projects as public or common goods, oriented towards the community\u2019s well being. There is now evidence available to indicate that communities can indeed provide stewardship, re-using assets, exapting them for new uses, and preserving their functionality and beauty over time. However, issues of fairness arise around any reallocation of right-to-access that are not completely solved, and this makes policy making in this area potentially controversial.\n\n----\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/why-we-care-about-stewardship/3460/1?oe=1\n`concepts: diversity`\n\nWe are already in deep conversation with many people and groups working on this matter \u2013 from key policy advisors in the UK, to cooperative consultancies in Spain, to hackers and squatters in Poland and intentional communities in Ireland and Greece.\n\n----\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care-system/4880/1?oe=1\n`crisis`\n\nIn 2011, some senior doctors started comparing notes, and they saw a perfect health care storm brewing at the horizon. \u201cWe knew something very bad was coming, and people would die \u2013 says Maria \u2013 so we decided we must do something.\u201d\n\n----\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/worldwide-1-in-5-people-has-a-respiratory-disease-we-co-create-freely-available-respiratory-health-games-and-devices/702/1?oe=1\n`design intervention`\n\nBreathing Games (www.breathinggames.net) promotes respiratory health by encouraging the appropriation of care by each citizen.\nWe create a common \u2013 collectively managed resources that are freely accessible and can be used and enriched by everyone \u2013 by spurring collaboration between all interested stakeholders to build on collective intelligence\nThe project concentrates on healthy behaviours and has been developed collectively with patient associations, health institutions, universities and other organisations.\nThe games produced participatorily are meant to improve the quality and life expectancy of people with respiratory problems \u2013 by educating, transforming therapy into games, and promoting healthy habits. They can be reused and adapted by everyone to address local problems and needs, as long as the free/libre and open-source licences are maintained. We also develop open-source hardware such as flowmeter for domesic use. This material shall enable everyone, in all countries, to get indicators about his health (lung capacity tests), and shall also provide decentralized, anonimyzed data to advance public health research (blockchain/IPFS).\nOn top of that we have been building a community of people to further develop and distribute the games. We successfully organized gamejams about cystic fibrosis and asthma in Switzerland and in Canada, and plan other events on breathing health and chronic respiratory diseases in the next months. The audience is huge: 1 out of 5 people in the world suffer from chronic respiratory diseases, and half of them do not follow the therapy as agreed with their caregiver.\nKey to the success of this initiative is the socio-economic, non-exclusive model we developed, as well as the platform we use to log contributions and redistribute to the contributors the raised funds. We use agile development methodologies and allow members to self-organise, so that we build on the collective intelligence and transform ideas into sustainable, scalable products and services.\nThe participatory, inclusive approach enables us to build research-backed games that also are attractive and fun to play with.

Self-organised people with no money and no organisation that beat credentialed, moneyed professionals at their own game? We've seen this before. It was Wikipedia outcompeting Encyclopedia Britannica. It was OpenStreetMap pushing to the curbs Garmin and TomTom. It was Facebook groups coordinating disaster relief after the Nepal 2015 earthquakes and the Tbilisi 2015 flash flood, way before the government and NGOs could get their act together. It was Internet-coordinated young newcomers changing the rules of the political game, and even bringing down entire regimes who seemed to have all the power and all the money, in Egypt, Tunisia and Ukraine.\nWe have a word for these phenomena: we call them disruption. They are associated with supplying goods or services in a new way, that substitutes collective intelligence and distributed effort for vertical organisations. This new way happens to be vastly more efficient than the old ones.\n\n----\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care-system/4880/1?oe=1\n\n`disruption`\n\nrespectab\n\n----\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/rete-g2-the-incredibly-true-adventure-of-a-group-of-foreigners-in-their-own-home-i-hate-long-titles/1482/1?oe=1\n`diversity`\n\nSuch a group decided to work together on two fundamental points:\n1.

Either they're homeless, or they are living in insecure, or temporary accommodation.\nWe had more than 2000 people use the space in 2011, which added up to more than 12000 hours of usage. Helping and facilitating this number of people, particularly when some of them have difficulties, is a huge job.\n\n----\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care-system/4880/1?oe=1\n`donations (of goods, not money)`\n\nIt does not accept donations in money.

For example Nepal is not terribly far away from Pakistan where we know there is lots of drones loitering around. Many of them could have hopped over to Nepal with at max one stop-over for refueling in no time flat. I may have missed some (thanks for the link @Alberto ), but so far I haven't seen many of the unambiguously beneficial uses exploited a whole lot. And some of them have been blindingly obvious in the last couple of weeks, and really not difficult to get at least working on.\n\nI don't want to belittle the fact that there are many small initiatives all over the place, and in most cases there is a LOT more work going on inside than meets the eye. One of the problems I have though is that if large sums of government money are to be spent on such a technology - that obviously has a significant and very complex societal impact - we don't seem to bother to discuss it in an effective manner. Such an attempt would include the people that make the tech, the people that operate it, and - very important - the ones affected by it. Before we produce all the facts. With drones we are looking at a very wide range of outcomes we could end up with, some of them very difficult or impossible reverse. Also we should be aware of a problem's roots, even when we feel compelled to fight the symptoms. We need to keep track of the externalities of a technology, and stay realistic.\nAt the moment all money pretty much goes exclusively to the usual suspects. How can civil society, at least parts of the \"global south\", or women's voices be heard and considered in such a process? When would this be done if not in the early stages of making the concepts? Are the current practices established in industry conducive to such a process (large mil ind complex organizations elbowing for money)? How is their track record of managing such programs, that need to stay flexible and permeable to tackle a field full of unknown unknowns (and un-unknow some knowns in the process) - to say it with the words of Rumsfeld and \u017di\u017eek, respectively.\nOf course it won't be simple and it won't be without friction, but if I weigh this against the societal cost of opportunity, and ER's chance to help connect and guide many center actors through a very dynamic edge - the problem has our name written all over it. I would love to hear other people's perception on this before I publish the next steps I could envision this taking. I am not only looking at @Marc @francesco210173 @Baptiste Labat but expressly into the social/gender direction (@noemi , @SamarAli , others - it is not super urgent but perhaps you know someone you can nudge when you are a little less busy than you must be now?)\n\n----\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/why-we-care-about-stewardship/3460/1?oe=1\n`Edgeryders`\n\nThe Edgeryders community has accumulated significant experience in this area. Many of us have been experimenting with ways to communally manage diverse assets including: spaces like the unMonastery, digital mesh networks, geographic databases or software projects as public or common goods, oriented towards the community\u2019s well being. There is now evidence available to indicate that communities can indeed provide stewardship, re-using assets, exapting them for new uses, and preserving their functionality and beauty over time. However, issues of fairness arise around any reallocation of right-to-access that are not completely solved, and this makes policy making in this area potentially controversial.\n\n----\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/main-session-the-edge-of-funding/6427/1?oe=1\n`financial models`\n\nOPEN VILLAGE SESSION: Sustainability - funding and financial models\nA panel curated by @Gehan | @WinniePoncelet | @Noemi\n\nOpenVillage, 19-21 October, Brussels\nYou want to sustain the good work you are doing.

The overarching logic behind their development and acquisition is generally to enable the provision of public services. In recent decades this model has become overstretched: states have found themselves struggling to find the resources to keep those assets manned so that provision of such services could continue, and had to retreat from many non-core services. Consequently, many such assets lie unused; some are beginning to deteriorate. They are extremely varied in nature; many are buildings, gardens, parks.

How much can one worker sort per hour (under bad, average and good working conditions)?\n2. What is the typical error rate of humans when sorting coffee? (Look up \"double picked\" and \"triple picked\" coffee, which means the coffee goes through human sorting twice or thrice. There have to be statistics how much it improves through these added steps, and ways to calculate the error rate of the previous steps based on that. Can you try to make these calculations please.)\n3. What do workers in manual coffee sorting earn? 10-20 wage examples covering different countries and different employers (family farm, coop, large business) will give us a good impression already. Converting the wages in PPP (purchasing power parity) in addition to showing the in the local currencies will help us comparing them.\n4. How many hours can a person work per day for sorting coffee, and how does it affect the speed and error rate of the sorting if people work more or less than this?\n5. What are health issues experienced by people sorting coffee manually as their job? (I assume posture problems like neck tension, back pain etc.)\n6. What about work satisfaction? (Anecdotal evidence / stories are ok.

As this \"threatened societal cohesion\", the king would have all clay tablets recording private debt thrown into the Euphrates, and the cycle began again. Of course, these were _local_ whole societies.\n\nWhat did not happen is those folks deciding to stay out and build a different society, but then what could they have done? Once they were back into the field and farm, and once their families had returned home, they were living in a more or less  state-of-the-art society.

Default gets rid of the malcontents. Cheaper than coming down on them. But 50% walkaway may not be an equilibrium. Perhaps even 10% might be too much. One of the characters warns another:\n\n> [...] This isn't stable. There isn't going to be default world and walkaway world trading people forever.

There  is no \"central command\" Mostly, it's about property rights: anything worth something is fenced and forbidden to walkaways. They are befriended by First Nation people (who have been left onto the very worst lands on the American continent); at one time a group is living on a nuclear accident site \u2013 [an involuntary park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_park) \u2013 and they need to wear anti-rad gear whenever they go outside. Still, Doctorow takes the view that human labour + open tech can go a long way. Especially since this is a SF novel, and nothing is stopping the author from imagining super-advanced recycling, Von Neumann robots, and DIY biotech that can make food from basically nothing. The latter reminded me of @winnieponcelet and edible mushrooms that can grow just fine on wet cardboard! \n\nAs for your final consideration, @markomanka, I would say this: I do not see how walkaway must be all-or-nothing. You can turn your back on some aspects of default living, and yet maintain some economic communication with them. An example are the Amish: they grow their own food, they build their own houses, but they do not make their own diesel engines. There are Amish sawmills, but but no Amish steel mills. Some stuff from the non-Amish world goes into the Amish world, which means that some stuff comes back out, and the ledgers are balanced.

They weigh in the empirical evidence with as little hypothesis as they can get away with.\n\nWe are looking at a service design take on making an analytical tool (this taxonomy) which is very actionable. Can we validate this by coming at it independently? With 2 enthographical approaches: offline observation, and digital ethnography. To the extent that it is validated, it is immediately actionable to be used as a policy instrument.\n\nEzio: methodologies in design action-research are partly different from those of other disciplines.\n\nPossible outlets for dissemination.

You play the script I prepared for Federico, grab the tags as they pop-up and map them. I understood the replay would be articulated into phases (that's how I read the matrix -- as trajectories).

Insights that were useful for the team at WeMake to start prototyping a new interface, a digital tool to make the regulation procedure more intuitive, easier to fill out, faster, pain and frustration-free.\n\nIn order to guarantee accessibility, cross-compatibility and to enable easy iterations and future implementation we decided to prototype a tool in the form of a web app.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cb9ab675aa829a3252d66680a6cd15bff0f44492.jpg\" width=\"521\" height=\"500\">\n\nHere are the key factors that led us to designing a tool that was user driven instead of bureaucracy driven:\n\n<em>Complexity</em>\n\nIt\u2019s very common for bureaucratic procedures to be designed in a way that first off satisfies bureaucracy needs. In our case, for instance, the way the information is organized doesn\u2019t really take into considerations the way Minerva (our shop owner) would think about solving the accessibility problem, but it put things into the perspective of solving a bureaucratic issue from the point of view of the person who would review the filled module.\n\nAs a consequence, the first thing we did was creating a logic chart of the questions that Minerva would ask herself while approaching the accessibility problem.\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9a613777d0431bccbdada123312b4a7ad8233e1c.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"228\">\n\nThe questions that would more easily push Minerva out of the procedure were put upfront. This might sound strange for some of you, as if we are helping shop owners skipping the procedure, but of course this is not what we want... Let\u2019s try to wear Minerva shoes for a sec, would you be happy or frustrated to be notified that there is another procedure for shops that are currently under renovation after the procedure have asked you to measure the sidewalk, the obstacle and you have looked for a ramp online? Something tells me you would be quite frustrated...\n\nIt\u2019s with this approach that we did our best to guide Minerva exactly to the areas of the procedure that would fit her specific situation and to let her skip all the rest.\n\n<em>Comprehension</em>\n\nA big issue of the procedure that resulted from user research was technical language.\n\nAfter reading and re-reading all the documents the approach we have taken in this case is two-folded:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tFirst we wanted to understand and interpret what really was the point of the question and then formulate a new question that would more easily go to that point using a language that would be closer to Minerva\u2019s one</li>\n\n<li>\tSecondly we followed the rule that \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words\u201d and we accompanied text with pictures and illustrations everywhere possible \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<em>Assistance</em>\n\nIn line with the simplification of the procedure\u2019s logic and the restructuring of the data flow, we decided to give the tool the form of a series of questions, just as if Minerva was being interviewed and assisted by an employee of the municipality during the filling of the procedure.\n\n<em>Pleasure</em>\n\nLast but not least, we wanted to give the interface a fresh but very simple look.

With these particular attention from a purely technical point of view, it is necessary to evaluate the human resources (from the Community or not) and instrumental resources that Edgeryders actually has the possibility to put in place in order to allow the whole infrastructure to grow harmoniously and in compliance with its own aims.\n\nAs far as the choice of the database is concerned, rather than supporting the application of a specific product, it seems to me at the moment more interesting to reflect on the approach and the technological solutions that can better respond to both the Platform's urgency and its medium-long development term (eg big data, data mining, machine learning, semantic data, tagging date, blob data, etc.).\nIn this regard, I would like to suggest reading the following resources, with particular care not to overlook the projects and / or the open source initiatives:\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_data_model;\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing;\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL.\n\nRegarding the choice of tools for management and cooperation within and outside the Platform, considering that the current solution implemented with Discourse can not respond to these next venture needs, I think it is appropriate to consider all those solutions technology thoughts and constructs around the paradigms of user interaction and cross-platform cooperation.\nIn this sense, I still want to point out some of the solutions that have attracted my attention in recent years, always with the utmost care not to overlook the projects and / or the open source initiatives, but referring to an interesting page (https: // en .wikipedia.org / wiki / List_of_collaborative_software):\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfresco_(software);\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liferay.\n\nFinally, it would be the question of the ict service infrastructure that, in PaaS or SaaS mode, should guarantee the overall operation of the Platform in the light of the choices made in the first two points.\nThe solutions are different, of course, and I think you deserve a different decision-making moment.\n\nI close this my (long) intervention arguing how choosing a technical solution necessarily involves building an organizational system that plasms and affinates the built-up infrastructure in turn. In addition, as I write, I reflect on the opportunity to think at least of an external communication platform strategy that illustrates the ways in which it is to be adopted and the goals to be achieved both in the analytical field of data generated by ethnographic tools in the most exquisite management sector.\nI guess a sort of campaign for resource and skills connectivity that is complementary to what can be organically found in Edgeryders.

It is a big and important topic in Europe what with an ageing population and a general rise in costs. But it didn\u00b4t register on my radar until a friend in Berlin mentioned that he doesn\u00b4t have health insurance as the costs were too high ( something like 300 Euros/month) and that he is far from alone in this. It\u00b4s pretty scary because as a craftsperson he handles lots of dangerous equipment and at least one of his friends had had an accident recently while not being insured. As you can imagine the consequences were pretty awsul, both from a psychological but also finacial point of view.\n\nWhile exploring the concept of commons and what work people are doing in this space the topic of healthcare popped up and it felects the provision of helathcare as percieved from the perspective of \"recipient\": <a href=\"/t/healthcare-for-all/1419\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/healthcare-all</a>. I think the reflections in this post that you shared on twitter are a good overview of the discussion from a metalevel: <a href=\"http://healthafteroil.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/goodbye-to-bad-knowledge/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://healthafteroil.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/goodbye-to-bad-knowledge/</a>. But there is no real conversation or discussion of solutions.\n\nI grew up in a household with \"Where there is no doctor\" as the first point of refence for dealing with health issues courtesy if a geeky Dad from a rural community in the middle of nowhere in Sudan. And I am pretty convinced that we can do a lot of peer-2-peer innovation to free up resources for critical health care provision. But to be honest I would prefer alternatives where we are not put at the mercy of private interests. And so I would really like to explore feasible alternatives and different approaches that seem promising. Anyone know of relevant initatives, ongoing or past, we could learn from? They could be failures too, you can leqarn alot from exploring what went wrong :)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-04 09:30:50", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:11.886813", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 401, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39211, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 7638, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@matthias I'd love your thoughts on the database when you can mercii\n\n@johncoate @cindys @chrisjcook @francesco_maria_zava @nabeel_p Would very much appreciate any thoughts you may have also :cherries:", "created_at": "2017-11-09 15:32:33.350902", "updated_at": "2017-11-09 15:32:33.350902", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 29, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 15.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39274, "user_id": 200, "topic_id": 7638, "post_number": 4, "raw": "@matthias and all, colleagues of mine are developing a service we are calling [TrunkDB](http://www.trunkdb.com/) which may help.

Thinking about it more deeply, it makes sense to me to place what you're doing in a spectrum from monodisciplinary research to transdisciplinary research.\u00a0<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KCHRLWsPe6Wx7EOsTuC5zWN52X2BESlkIvs38028UZI/edit?usp=sharing\">This excerpt</a> from my workshop on interdisciplinary collaboration &amp; communication explains a little.\u00a0It seems to me you're doing the interdisciplinary thing, but not yet to the extent it can be considered a new field?\n\nFor me this classification in terms of mono, inter, trans is tied to communication efforts. In the mushroom material research, Elise and I went\u00a0from multidisciplinary to interdisciplinary and ultimately transdisciplinary. Now we're at the point where we actively involve society in the research through workshops &amp; outreach. Initially our communication with each other had to improve, then to other professionals (eg. designers, biologists) and ultimately to the public (hobbyists, children, ...). It took progressively more effort in terms of communication and practical things: translating experiments into digestible, accessible\u00a0activities for people to interact with). I feel like the payoff is there (we get ideas, connections, an audience, ...), but going that far with communication does take a lot of time. We can do it because I'm not involved in the lab research anymore, only as project manager for outreach\u00a0and missions.\n\nThere is of course also the argument that what has been researched using tax money should be made accessible and understandable apart from there being a payoff for your research by\u00a0involving society.\n\nMaking complex information understandable takes time, so the most economical solution is to define your audience and write for them, rather than for any\u00a0audience. The latter means taking into account the group that has the hardest time understanding, without compromising in content or form\u00a0too much for any group. That is hard and you always end up losing detail or nuance. You wouldn't write so that an 8 year old could understand you, even if you were perfectly capable, unless your plan is to go specifically to them with your post.\n\nA\u00a0technical person is okay with a separate glossary page. For engaging a non-technical person, who perhaps has no experience with technical texts and their structure, having to check words in a glossary may break the story and their attention. Your post on your own blog about the results of the Horizon 2020 research is pretty good overall. I see the distinction between result (good potential to be\u00a0relevant for a non-expert) and analysis tool (less potential to be relevant for a non-expert), yet it comes down to your own ambitions, judgment and\u00a0what you want to say to whom.\n\nSo all in all, I understand the communication aspect in this context in terms of\u00a0where you're at with the research (new field\u00a0or not? Multi, inter, transdisciplinary?), where you want to go (Multi, inter, transdisciplinary?) and how you want to do it (who to involve and why?).\n\nMaybe @NiekD or @Scigrades can pitch in as well.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-14 08:53:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:03.701228", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 634, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33370], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85371, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14602, "post_number": 9, "raw": "I am set up.

This situation was created by her choice to treat poignant words in the text as codes, and by Open Ethnographer itself not forbidding users to do so. I have since decided this is a bug and not a feature. \n\nHowever, @jason_vallet has taken the initiative of assigning the value of the `note` field of the codeless annotation to their `tag_id` field. So the graph is still solid, in the sense of reflecting what Shweta did. The problem is, by reusing the words of the informants, her coding drifts towards a folksonomy instead of inducing an ontology. \n\n\n### The trouble with folksonomies\n\nFor example, we have six different codes around \"workshop\":\n\n```\nworkshop\nworkshop.\nworkshops\nopen village workshop\nmena workshop\nedgeryders workshop\n```\n\nAt a first glance, it looks like these are really six ways to say the same thing, and should be merged. \n\nLook at \"technology\":\n\n```\nmultinational technology and media companies\ngeo-localization technologies\ntechnology of design\nawe technology\nself-supply technologies\nit/digital technologies\ntechnology\nzewail city university of science and technology\nfreedom enabling technology\ntechnological experimental labs\nopen knowledge and technologies\n```\n\nThere is more diversity here, but again some might be merged. Also, it is interesting to note the use of \"and\". If you are working with semantic networks, codes should perhaps not contain \"and\". If a post mentions a connection between widgets and gadgets, the ethnographer might create an annotation with `widgets` as the code, and then a _second_ one with `gadgets` as the code. The network will then show the codes `widgets` and `gadgets` as connected, as they co-occur. On the other hand, open knowledge and technologies seems to say \"this post is about the relationship between open knowledge and technologies\". This is fair enough, but it risks missing out, because open knowledge might come up elsewhere in association to, say ethics. In this case, we would have two disconnected codes, `open knowledge and technologies` and `open knowledge and ethics`, instead of three _connected_ ones, `ethics` connected to `open knowledge` connected to `technology`.\n\nMaybe this can be taken care of by a second pass. \n\nAs a result, the structure of the graph is not as connected as the ones that Amelia was producing for OpenCare. When k = 1 (nodes= 645, edges =1,720):\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f0b78167e5aad805cd31df23620188885fdb7069.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"395\">\n\nFiltering for k= 2 (nodes = 63, edges = 109) we even lose the giant component:\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5b59af5864547a6012cfebf52337b0ec72a5a89c.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"395\">\n\n\n### What we do now \n\nImmediately:\n\n1. @daniel goes through the codeless annotations, and copy the `quote` field onto the `tag_id` field. \n\nLater:\n\n1. Shweta herself, helped by @amelia, may reconsider some of those annotation (second pass).\n\n2. Jason or I re-extract the graph, etc.\n\n\n### What we have learned\n\n1. **There are huge _and tacit_ differences between the coding styles of different ethnographers**. Despite being trained to use OE by Amelia, Shweta adopted a completely different interpretation of how the software should be used. We were not aware of the issue until we actually looked at the graph. Ethnographers do not appear to feel a strong need to document their field practices, perhaps because in general they work alone, so the only thing they share is the finished paper. @akmunk rightly pointed out that some ethno research projects have a strong need to protect the privacy of informants, so that open data and open notebook science might be an issue.\n\n2. **Different styles of coding induce different network structures**.  Yet another reason to have clear and explicit guidelines for what constitutes \"good coding\".", "created_at": "2017-12-02 12:04:34.821386", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 00:36:32.490692", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 647, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 43.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33385, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 6379, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Thanks, added</b>\n\nFantastic, thanks!\u00a0I added the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_51GdQ-X3Jzei1LNDNTb043eEk\">notes in pdf format</a>\u00a0to the wiki.

However, as quite some changes are needed anyway, we can also start from scratch with a FreeCAD model. The major constraints are a max size of 540\u00d7360 mm for the large side of the machine (see BoM in the first post), and to only use rectangular sheet material pieces in the next version of the design. This allows manufacturing with a table saw, no CNC etc. needed. Connecting the wood / plastic sheet material pieces would be done with L profile angles or similar (which do not have to be put into the model in the first version).\n\n2. **Publishing that model on [P3D](https://p3d.in/).** This allows visitors to inspect the design in 3D in the browser in various modes (textured and shaded, textured only, wireframe, x-ray etc.). The challenge, as always with browser based 3D content, is how to efficiently make the model a low-poly one.\n\n    When doing this task, we'd also like the process documented in a tutorial :) (Publishing the tutorial as open content on a suitable Stack Exchange platform is usually a good idea; here the [superuser.com](https://superuser.com/) platform seems the most suitable).\n\n3. **Build instructions in 3D.** Not sure about this one and / or how it can be done, but it would sure be nice :)", "created_at": "2018-03-28 17:23:25.561855", "updated_at": "2018-03-28 17:23:44.215830", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 305, "wiki": false, "reads": 30, "score": 56.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4428, 3811], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81132, "user_id": 6505, "topic_id": 14183, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello, everyone! My name is John O\u2019Duinn and I want to start first by saying a big **THANK YOU** to @nadia , @MariaEuler  and @RoRemote  for making this event happen. \n\nIt was my honor to give the opening talk at **EdgeRyders Next Generation Internet Event.** This is part of **EU Next Generation Internet** - and the outcomes of what we discuss here will help inform what focus, investments and policies Europe will choose to build a next generation internet that supports the wellbeing of citizens, organisations and ecosystems. With that in mind, it struck me that over the years, we\u2019ve evolved from **Internet connectivity**, to **Internet for businesses**, to **Internet of Things** and now to the **Next Generation Internet for Humans**. The obvious question is - why now? \n\nI'm glad you asked! \n\n1) We are at an interesting inflection point in society, with several large tipping point changes happening at the **same** time:\na) Technology changes - smartphones, free streaming video, high speed internet on smartphones. Internet usage is now mostly on mobile devices - not desktop. \nb) Changes in Social contract - no more job for life. Average job tenure keeps shrinking. Even \u201ctemp/contract work\u201d is shrinking to per-task/gig work.  \nc) Generational changes - Millennials became the largest segment of US workforce in 2016, GenZ will become the second largest segment of workforce this year (2020). Also people who would \u201cnormally\u201d have retired by now are staying in the workforce because they lost their pensions/saving during the last big recession, so have no choice but to keep working. These factors together mean this is the first time we have five different generations all in the workforce at the time.\nd) COVID-19 has been an accelerator of this trend, but it\u2019s important to keep in mind that these trends have been going on for years before covid-19. We dont know how long will COVID-19 be a concern into the future, but I believe it is not measured in days or weeks. \ne) Many companies in Silicon Valley already announced not moving back to offices this year; some already said not until mid-2021, and many announced moving to \u201cremote first\u201d workforce. While this might sound extreme, this is not \u201conly\u201d Silicon Valley. To show how mainstream this is, in City of London, 30 largest employers already talking about only 20-40% occupancy *at most*. One example I found recently was: \u201c*I think the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past, and we will find ways to operate with more distancing over a much longer period of time,*\u201d Jes Staley, CEO Barcley\n\n2) The \u201cold normal\u201d was not working for most people. \na) Traffic and commuting is so bad that demand for housing near offices is causing a housing crisis as well as gentrification-and-displacement disruptions for others who don\u2019t work for that employer yet still need to live there for their job.  \nb) People were spending more time commuting to work. This caused the creation of \u201ccommuter towns\u201d and \u201cbedroom communities\u201d, built for people who live and sleep there, but commute to work in a different town.\nc) The environmental impact of all this traffic is significant. According to the California Air Resource Board, people driving cars, mostly to and from work is 28% of total emissions. 28%. Everything else, truck, planes, agriculture, electricity stations are each under 10%. \nd) Those who lived outside of commuting distance of employer offices have higher rates of long-term unemployment. Over time, they accurately felt more sidelined from the \u201cbooming economy\u201d, which in many cases led to resentment of the economic and political status quo.\ne) No surprise that two weeks ago, a Yougov survey in England found only 6% wanted life to be exactly the same as it was before COVID-19. \n\n3) **Traditional Economic Development** is when a jurisdiction gives money to a large employer so they move to your town. The company will pay corporate taxes, so eventually the jurisdiction gets its money back. Additionally, the company hires local humans, trains them as they progress up the career ladder and work there for life. But the social changes mean that formula no longer works.\na) Because of \u201cno more job for life\u201d, employers only want to move to a location where there are pre-trained unemployed candidates waiting to be hired. If not enough are there, a sudden influx of people can cause gentrification and displacement of existing humans.\nb) Because of \u201cno more job for life\u201d, humans don't want to relocate for a new job. Relocating is expensive and disruptive to family life. Trend to dual-income families means someone has to give up their job to become trailing-spouse. Especially when you know you\u2019ll be switching jobs again in a 1-2-3 years.\nc) Encouraging companies to relocate is hard, expensive and takes a long time. As Amazon discovered in NewYork recently, \n\n4) If Traditional Economic Development is no longer working, now what? How about trying something different - Distributed Economic Development. This is the heart of a law I helped write for The State of Vermont. This \u201cRemote Worker\u201d law has these essential parts:\na) Encouraging knowledge workers / creative class workers to relocate is easier, cheaper and faster then encouraging corporations.\nb) Each employed knowledge worker creates 4.8-5.7 jobs in the local community.\nc) Remember that humans are a social species. Even if we have high speed internet at home and can work from home all the time, we need social interaction with other humans to work online over prolonged periods of time. \nd) Find an existing unused building in a formerly-walkable neighborhood and convert it into a mixed-use neighborhood coworking space. Think of this as a node on the Next Generation Internet of Humans. @nachorodriguez , @jamieorr  and others here are also doing this.\ne) Remodel the building with a specific layout - different to the typical coworking spaces seen in larger metro cities and which helps increase foot traffic to nearby businesses to help them also survive!\nf) Provide incentives for some knowledge workers/creative class people to move to your community to help introduce these new concepts into daily life and start the movement in that location.\n\n\n5) How does this work? \na) People move to live in your neighborhood, bringing their **existing** jobs with them and start working from your small neighborhood coworking space. Even when they change employer jobs every few years, they still live in the same neighborhood and still walk to work online from the same neighborhood coworking space. \nb) These people diversify the tax revenue for your community, which is important to avoid the \u201call eggs in one basket\u201d risk.\nc) The more people do this, the more their neighbors see they also can find real meaningful jobs online. This helps reduce \u201cbrain drain\u201d caused by people graduating school/university and leaving town looking for jobs elsewhere. \nd) Because they are all walking to neighborhood coworking spaces, they are not commuting in cars or public transport, which helps the environment immediately and for low cost.\n\n**Does this really work? YES!**\n\nThis was an important part of the State of Vermont\u2019s \u201cRemote Worker\u201d law I helped write; it was wildly successful and I\u2019m now working on similar laws and policies for other jurisdictions. It\u2019s not just me. In the US, others have done similar initiatives for places like Tulsa OK, Savannah GA, Alabama and Utah. \nHere, today, @jamieorr , @nachorodriguez , @FayeScarlet  and @mayursontakke  (and others!)  are each doing this, in slightly different ways, with their neighborhood community coworking spaces. Each is successful in their own business. Each has been successful in supporting other businesses in their community. Each is helping their local economy. Please listen to what they have to say during today\u2019s various sessions. See if this would help in your own local community. \n\nPlease join us in this movement by spreading the word or sharing any ideas you have to help with others here on the resilience.edgeryders.eu forums. After all, this Next Generation Internet of Humans might, just might, save the planet. \n\nThank you.\n\nJohn.", "created_at": "2020-07-29 06:22:12.866838", "updated_at": "2020-12-13 08:20:42.070081", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1372, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 149.0, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 6442, 2915, 3, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39894, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 7764, "post_number": 11, "raw": "May I ask @jason_vallet to share with us his data (claiming \"hundreds\" of tag_id = null annotations).

Do we need to maintain different sets of images of good and bad beans for different types of beans?[/quote]\n\nYes, I think different image sets would be the way to go. Think of the image set as the \"configuration\" of the optical sorter. Optical sorters from industry also need configuration, typically by entering parameters. We want to go for image classifiers, so our configuration would be example images. You would sort maybe 1-2 kg of beans by hand first, set the sorter to configuration mode, feed it the good beans (and tell it these are the good ones), feed it the bad beans (and tell it), and then set it to sorting mode and let it sort.\n\nThe image set we have so far is of semi-natural processed Arabica from upper Gorkha, Nepal. It's meant as a test dataset to prove that image classifiers work at all.\n\nIf you want, you could contribute your own datasets. It's quite some work to create them before you have a sorter, though. We now [made a script](https://github.com/edgeryders/coffee-cobra/tree/master/utils) to automatically extract individual bean images from pictures of ~50 beans though. So the above instructions using GIMP plugins are outdated now.\n\n[quote=\"wyang, post:3, topic:8335\"]Or any way, we still share some of the images sets?

I was positively uplifted by reading your testimony just now.  Your description of the experience brought it all back to me with that warm feeling that was present in the group at all times during the entire time we were gathered in Brussels.  I can't think of a single moment during the whole thing when that was not true.  It is a huge reason why I feel so at home here.\n\nThat feeling of dilution is inevitable after such a gathering.

A commons is something built with the attention and energy of the participants and clearly you have a clear sense of value.

I'm actively still trying to digest and marinade the experiences shared and those that I desire post-conference; and how that fits into my existing practice and my desires to work with others.\n\nFirstly, finding the network approximately a year ago brought me a sense of solace and arb belonging as I learnt about the overarching aims of Edgeryders and learnt about its membership through the stories shared. I believe in the power of storytelling and that every single person has the capacity to tell and share their story, if desired. This, for me, was monumental as I've actively resigned from my job as a project manager and researcher in the context of Public Engagement and Safety in South Africa. I actively chose not to pursue yet another job title that robs both me and the communities I work with of agency, creativity and any semblance of freedom. Yet, this elusive and imaginary network remained some steps away from me, not nearly close enough to actively engage with. Until the Festival! Bear with me here...\n\nSecondly, learning about the upcoming Open Festival 2017 ignited a spark. _\"_What if I could be in the presence of this community of likeminded souls who have a desire to create for a greater meaning and desire to contribute toward life, community and transformation from varying angles... _What if Nabeel.... What if?_\"__. This network may not be as elusive as I imagined. And this may be my chance to derail myself from my current trajectory...It was in that moment that I decided to find a way to be in London a day before the Festival in Brussels, so that I could attend. Bear in mind I'm from South Africa and after being unemployed for that long, I had no disposable income after selling my belongings for  a cause. Being unemployed did not mean being inactive. I sold my belongings to test an approach that struck me as important in the context of urban poor and public health. So how does this connect to my experience, you ask? Well finally I'd be in the presence of others that value what I value...possibly?  \n\nSo arriving in Brussels on day 1 of the festival while the initial presentation commenced, I looked around the room as I tiptoed to a space to let down my hair, remove my stinky jacket after being on a train station at 4am in London, drop my backpack and accept that I've finally arrived in a space that may just change the trajectory of my life, perhaps for a short period or perhaps forever... Fundamentally, my gut told me \"_Ok you're in a space with a bunch of urban hippies, much like yoursel_f.\" Internalizing the space and the interaction of participants with presenters and myself made me smile, laugh, and in an arb way validified my own work and meaning-making which is basically an undefined social transformative process based on interaction and collaborations with varied parties for a common goal. Immediately, I realised that my own work mirrored the [un]conference and my excitement increased! Until the cooking began, and I needed to focus. Cooking for 100 persons is not joke, but that doesn't mean it wasn't fun and contributed to my learning and my experience.\n\nNaturally I was struck by the transparent means in which the company and Festival was managed. I was then immediately struck by an \"openness\" not only in reference to work and data, but in reference to the genorisity of expression and interest displayed by every single participant. More so I was struck by this very dense  almost tangible and contagious feeling that enveloped the venue of collaboration, contribution and sharing. I've missed this and currently miss it. Needless to say the most energetic and re-assuring feeling was meeting others who believe in a collective cause, themselves and the network itself. I was given care, simply by being involved. And John Coates words echo in my mind's heart as I write this...\n\n _\"I wanted to be more like them and learn more, more than wanting to be the same\"_\n\nThis, for me sums up my emotions and professional desires since being introduced to the network. This inherent connection between participants was and is phenomenal. All of us, without speaking about it, appears to have been guided by similar principles, ideals and beliefs on community, collaboration and sharing. It's what brought us together and what I believe will maintain us as a collective. And I keep imagining the beauty that would be created if we were present in the same venue for a prolonged period of time. For now, that venue is the www.edgeryders.eu .\n\nI kept thinking that the calibre of persons in the venue are such, that if any of us were asked to pack a bag in order to directly contribute to a great good...that it's probable that all of us have done so before and if asked we would do it again. \n\nNow, that I'm back in South Africa this sense of belonging is mildly diluted. I, for one, will actively strive for ways in which our skills and resources could be pooled together for collaborative proposal writing. No single person should own projects. These relationships and our collective efforts and works has the inherent capacity to elevate and extend our impact in so many directions to so many persons. So although the sense of belonging is diluted, it does not undermine the sense of \"family\" I've felt and continue to feel. And I can foresee that I will be stepping out of my comfort zone into this familial space whenever asked. \n\n_\"I am because we are\"..._ \n\nOne thing that baffles me is the meaning of the little Angel (literally) lying my drawer (Caring Through Uselessness 2017). I very much treat it as a reminder that unknowingly this community is where I've come from, and this Angel is a reminder for me to return when needed!\n\nI am completely grateful for the conversations, interactions, guidance, laughs, giggles, conversations and drinks shared!

Behavioural science is often seen as a fuzzy and fluid within the tech community with some enthusiasts propagating for key ideas or principles. This contributes to a feeling of behaviuoral science as quite \"faddy\" or fringe - while in reality it is not. Tech companies who in some way are working with or towards a user is really operating within an area where understanding human behaviour, aka. behavioural science is a central part of the product/solution/service. In short, tech believes behavioural science is fringe, but where there are humans, behavioural science is central.\n\n2. The behavioural science scope is narrow. Within applied behavioural science I come across a lot of requests to implement \"nudges\" in line with the famous [fly nudge](https://worksthatwork.com/1/urinal-fly) within both private and public sectors of business. Now projects I am involved in range from building PR campaigns to promote healthy behaviours, to optimising digital platforms for education to producing guidelines for human centered design within product and service design. What I see is often lacking is the vocabulary and insight into that there is so much more than simply \"nudge\"-implementations to be made from the behavioural science prespective.\n\nIn sum both of these points I see are due to a lack of understanding, which in turn stems from a lack of available information in regards to what BS is and how it can be applied.\n\nThank you for this question!\n\n/E", "created_at": "2020-12-16 14:05:29.225908", "updated_at": "2020-12-16 14:05:29.225908", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 263, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 61.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [88766], "is_liked_by": [4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86926, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 11193, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Yes that was before she joined.", "created_at": "2020-11-14 01:43:35.017891", "updated_at": "2020-11-14 01:43:35.017891", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [86886], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39730, "user_id": 3704, "topic_id": 7755, "post_number": 7, "raw": "As a woman keen on citizen science and biohacking I would be glad to help in this effort: but I am very much learning still about the MENA region and issues!!

My friends and I had amazing freedom to 'go out and play' usually with the instruction to simply return home for dinner. And there were no bike helmets either.  It's almost unheard of now. \n\nBut - that was a world where the mothers in the neighborhood (urban and suburban - I lived in both as a child) did not usually have jobs. That meant that as a kid if you had a bad problem or an injury, there was a mother at home nearby.  Even if you didn't know her, it is almost certain that she would have helped you.  So, there was more risk, but more help was usually available.\n\nNow most mothers work, usually at a job away from the home.  And they still have to keep the home scene together, unless they have unusually supportive husbands.  This means they don't have much time to understand, and then monitor, their kid's online activities.\n\nAnd much of today's info/communication tech - especially smart phone/tablet apps - is so easy to use that any enterprising kid, even very young, can tunnel their way into almost anything, such as hardcore porn, which just tends to ask you if you are over 18, to which you can simply click 'yes.'\n\nThe European trend seems to be to more heavily regulate technology, plus put in options for parental control.  But regulation always seems to play catchup when it comes to tech. And these days, companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon have so much money they can, and do, constantly create new ways to influence and even manipulate behavior.\n\nCan these problems be solved, or even much helped, by technology?

My first and a bit unstructured thoughs on the topic:\n\n1. We see that regular education can lack the ability to meet the child at their level and adapt the learnings into something that is actually interesting and useful to the child. For example, private finance education in schools for children is often found to have no effect on the financial literacy of the children. Digital tools can be made more flexible and as such meet the childs needs and adapt the learnings into something that is useful.\n\n2. The children of today and tomorrow will most likely live in completely digitalised economical landscapes and as such policy makers need to work with this in mind.\n \n3. I would like to advice policy makers to embrace the digitalisation of both the financial world as well as education. However, we must not forget that where we are in the development of the area right now is that these are tools to help us rather than complete systems that will give us all encompassing solutions. In short, tools that can and should complement other best practices in the fields.\n3. Digital tools and services in their own are not inherently \"bad\" for children and youth, and children of today and tomorrow will most likely be what some call digital natives. With this in mind I believe strongly that we cannot cut corners when it comes to the evaluation of potential benefits and harms.\n\nDo you have any more specific questions regarding this I am more than happy to continue digging deeper and reason with you!\n\n/Erik", "created_at": "2020-12-09 17:16:47.407880", "updated_at": "2020-12-09 17:16:47.407880", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 268, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 47.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [88617], "is_liked_by": [4934, 5059], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39744, "user_id": 4179, "topic_id": 7756, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Hello Anique.

We can raise the daily limit if needed. For the limit per minute, we could raise it to 30, but rather let the script sleep a bit in between the calls to be careful with the server.\n\nHowever @jason_vallet it seems that the real solution to reduce the number of API requests is to not get topics from a Discourse tag, then annotations for these Discourse topics. Instead, request the annotations pr Discourse tag, as well (like #ethno-opencare::tag). See our [preliminary API docs](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/97#issuecomment-338816804).\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:1, topic:7764\"]> Many annotations have no associated ethno tag [i.e. code][/quote]\n\nThis should not happen, and surely it is not possible to create such annotations within Discourse. So it is either an artefact of how coding happened in Drupal (perhaps indeed \"this word is meant as a code\"), or it is an error in our import routine.

In order to understand the meaning and role of participatory governance in culture, it is important to explore: changes in the socio-political context, cultural and social effects of new models of governance, modes and levels of involvement of all relevant stakeholders in decision-making processes and the (re)organization and relevance of their roles. Consequently, the Conference aims to explore the domain of participatory governance in culture from various angles, involving topics such as: 1) the implications of participation for democratic values in public (cultural) policies; 2) the complexities of power relations and authority devolution between different stakeholders; 3) differences among private, public and common interests of all relevant stakeholders; 4) ethics of participation; and 5) institutional and policies change and innovation.\"_\n\nI was there to present on \"Generative participatory governance: from organizational culture to inclusive citizenship\" as a part of my work with [Percolab](http://www.percolab.com/) and in collaboration with Nadine Jouanen. You can read my presentation in full [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cglItJ_UNemODjanF9K5uq9YmuPF21gazCQi1WoEnI4/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nI wasn't able to go to many sessions in the end but you share notes of those I went to [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JKLoP6oSz5iYP9SxJ46XRMhzCcS6s7EweV1aAxS9bJ0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nFor me the key takeaways from the whole thing are:\n\n1. \"Participation\" needs to be defined clearly anytime it is engaged as a technique or put forward as a strategy. There are too many types and it is too ambiguous to simply espouse it for the sake of its presence.\n\n2. Every context calls for different kinds of participation and a significant review of the cultural, social and political sensitivities of participation. For example, in Croatia, the history of former Yugoslavia means that participatory methods can be a reminder and trigger of the many forms of former communist control. Initiatives in Croatia and other former Eastern Bloc countries are walking a tricky but opportune line when it comes to incorporating participatory governance practices into their cultural initiatives. Situation specific approaches are necessary.\n\n3. For participatory governance to be truly effective it needs to be activated across the spectrum of partners and collaborators involved in a project. Many manifestations of participatory governance are still top-down, particularly in the case of the European Capitals of Culture, where responsibility is still held in the hands of government departments.

Blivande is the coordinator, and we received 19,000 EUR for the project.\n\n[**Here is the application.**](upload://AcK3M2smcjLB28yFD1hvddMdoI.pdf) (74.1 KB)\n\nShort-term network funding is granted mainly for travel and exchange between cultural institutions in the Nordics. Since the room for funding salaries would be minimal anyway, we decided to forgo it and just fund travel and accommodation for a total of 9-11 people from these organizations, for three \"embassy weeks\" in these cities - one week in each location, spread out over 2021.\n\nOur goal with this project is:\n\n> To develop cultural centers founded on principles of do-ocracy and participatory design. Such centers decentralize decision making and have different needs than centers with centrally curated programs. They also rely on unhindered convening in physical space which has been hard in the pandemic, calling for development of participatory processes online. We bring together three participatory cultural centers, one partner in online community building and one network of 80+ cultural spaces.''\n\nOur deliverables are minimal - we carry out these three embassy weeks, and round it up with writing a short report of a few pages, and present our findings in an online seminar. \n\nFor now, there are no action points. Just keeping you in the loop about that this is happening, and that the Edgeryders logo will be on the materials. If you can think of synergies with other projects, let me know. I am already tying this in with the proposal to Kulturbryggan for convening and online conversation on how to reform funding in the culture and arts.\n\nThis might open up some opportunities, and it goes to show that these funds are a viable option for the sort of things we do.

I made a quick tour of the website and you guys seem kicking ass. It warms up my heart even more each time I see active people like you guys. I hope I can contribute somehow along the way.\n\nSo my experience here, right?\n\nI'm not sure if you are aware but there was a rainbow gathering here around 6 months ago, in a very special beach south of Tulunggagun. A few people stayed and connected with some locals, even the mayor of the villages where the rainbow gathering was help was personally involved. Eventually most of the projects started dying slowly, some are still alive. I'm no rainbow and wasn't part of that. I just came to volunteer in one of those projects, a big permaculture project that eventually failed. Anyway, this is all not as important as all the people I have met since then, here, in jogja, in madiun, in surabaya... People are waking up and taking control of their lives, many projects, many amazing people, communities (I even met a guy who's runing an x-men community with disabled people). The shit I've seen here Natalia! These people are quite something. Anyway, there is this will of changing things, of starting from the people for the people, of community that I haven't seen as strong as this in any of the other places I've been to. I don't know if you have come to realize or experience, but this land is very special. The history, the spirituality, the community spirit, the generosity... And there's the term Wanatani that I came across a couple of months ago. It's an old sanskrit word that means plant-forest, or say farming by imitating the forest. I researched the term a bit more and I realized that it was not only about farming but all aspects of organized societies. This is their old way, which is probably the old way in most places, but here it is backed up by a strong history and spirituality. And there are other levels being at play here, geo-political, spiritual, prophecies... But let's not go too deep in generalities and go more practical.\n\nMy idea is very simple, connect every one in a smart localized way? Why create huge international structure when people can do it together on a local scale? I've seen the will, I've experienced it. Let's give them better tools and a little bit of structure. We have tried to start a coffee shop, a library, a farm (with a university and a meditation space) and it all hit a road block, or many, at some point. It's like something stronger than us was telling us: \"wait! this is too soon, let it ripen...\". I am also a foreigner and I didn't want to be \"the leader\" or \"the savior\". I believe change should come from the people themselves. Myself and others are just here to accompany, to encourage, to get our hands dirty when the time is right.\n\nBut before all of that, I believe one of the first steps that should be done is to create a website, or a website template. I have the template in mind. I have already started working even before coming here.

At the same time, customers, companies, and governments are panicking over the privacy implications of such rapid growth. These concerns are especially troubling given recent news revealing how worldwide internet traffic is often being illegally monitored and manipulated.\n\nFurthermore, most of whatever positive benefit that results from the rise of IoT will be disproportionately allocated to those already most well off. This can already be seen in the current state of the internet, which has left over 4 billion people disconnected and has crippled the average middle class consumer with a monthly phone bill of over USD 100.\n\nUnplugged provides the IoT with an alternative way to share information by leveraging a wireless communications network built off the connectivity (eg Bluetooth, wifi) in modern smartphones and soon to be integrated into all smart devices. With Unplugged, information travels encrypted, device-to-device, until reaches its final destination. By completely eliminating the need for centralized communication, people can communicate freely.\n\nIn order to achieve this goal, not only does Unplugged optimize the v4.1 Bluetooth Mesh Specifications for scale, but it also creates financial incentives that help encourage the network to grow. This is accomplished by sharing the connection fee that users pay to access the network amongst the intermediaries that helped pass along the information. In total, over 50% of all revenues are recycled back into the community through these intermediaries. Not only do these cash transfers help offset the cost of traditional data plans, but they also serve to help re-democratize the way we communicate in a way that is not possible through the traditional internet.\n\nResistant to natural disasters and spikes in network usage, Unplugged provides a solution with benefits for people from all socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-22 20:59:38", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 08:57:02.323747", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 364, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 8, 2160, 2424, 3433], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86662, "user_id": 6899, "topic_id": 14766, "post_number": 32, "raw": "Hi Leonie,\n\nThe SyRI legislation infringed privacy rights in several ways.

Also removing the current restriction that parent and child codes have to be by the same author. This would allow staff users to \"tidy up\" ethnographic coding work long after it has been done, and re-use codings for analysis by placing them into a different hierarchy (perhaps temporarily). It would also allow ethnographers to effectively re-use work of prior ethnographers by grouping them below own, currently used codes like this:\n\n    own code\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 code by other ethnographer #1\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 code by other ethnographer #2\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 \u2026\u2026\n\nWe would however not have \"parallel hierarchies\" as once proposed, because that seems like a total mess in UI terms and an overcomplication in the database, given ethnographers are not using the hierarchy feature much at all so far.

I'm not really young. I'm mid-life, so have had some years to get some things right. I made a decision 7 years ago to leave an institutional job so that I could live more freely and yet also more closely to my family. I like working from home, with my partner and child involved in what I do. We eat three meals a day together. My daughter is home schooled and my partner is an artist who works from home too. We bicker a little bit and sometimes I wish for a little more separation from my work and domestic tasks. But, generally, it works quite well. If we feel unwell or sad, we're there for each other. We can eat healthy food that we like. We can organise our day and our space as we like.\u00a0\n\nSome people ask why we only have one child. It doesn't seem normal. But, I feel it's responsible in a crowded planet to have no more than one (or maybe two) children. And I'm glad that it's more acceptable to choose to be childless too. I'm happier with the one child than my partner and daughter are, but I think they see the benefits.\u00a0\n\nI get a little frustrated with the conventional media assuming that there are women's roles and men's roles, and clearly delineated issues associated with those roles. Apart from the actual bearing of a child, everything else is interchangeable. My (male) partner has always played an active nurturing role, with childcare and home. All the tasks of making a thriving life are equal. It happens that some of the tasks I do bring in more money but the money doesn't assign more value to those tasks. In theory and most of the time, in reality. Sometimes, when we rub up against conventional thinking it doesn't feel so equal.\u00a0\n\nWhen I was growing up, my mum was the main full time worker outside the home, as well as the main domestic worker. My dad was an artist and involved in politics so he did have an active life outside the home, but it wasn't so much contributing to financial stability of the home. However, it did contribute to our education and social connections. It did have value. Sometimes, when we rubbed up against conventional thinking, it didn't feel so valuable.\u00a0\n\nThe key task of making a thriving home life is to disregard conventional thinking and to innovate, to find new ways of arranging your living space, your daily routine and your collaborations with your family members. Because my mum now has dementia, we're continually adjusting her care and routine as her condition changes. As the world becomes more changeable, we will all have to continually adjust and shuffle how we express our care for each other and our daily routines. We have to be open to change and try not to judge other people for their choices.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-04 18:20:22", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 09:59:25.575101", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 524, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41499, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 8029, "post_number": 4, "raw": "@anique.yael, sure about putting this into the \"[Culture Squad](/c/workspaces/culture-squad)\" cat :cat2:?

My name is Zach, and I am going to be leading a charge to reorganize the Wiki. @alberto and I have made a plan to get everyone mobilized to make our community the best it can be and have everything be easier to find. Feel free to check out my profile [here](https://edgeryders.eu/u/zvanstanley/summary). We have some awesome information, but we can make it even better. First order of business is that we need to make sure that **all** of the entries on this page are uniform and complete. For example, the entry for Walkaway under Novels is a full entry, in the form of (*Title*, by Author. Summary paragraph.) If an entry only has a title and author, it needs a summary. An entry is going to be a lot more useful if someone can read what it is about. \n\nWe also have a lot of things in the replies here and in other topics that can go in the main wiki text. If we can get the works mentioned there in the wiki (in the right format), we can get a lot more people to see them. Please get any media that you see that should be here onto this page, or flag it for us to take a look at. So, please edit the wiki. As long as you have a trust level of 2, you can edit. If you don't, you can message me @alberto to get a shiny new promotion.  \n\nAfter that, I think the wiki will be pretty large and might need to be broken into segments. My idea is to have it broken down into themes, like a page for economic science fiction works and a separate one for economic theories. Each page could then be tagged so it is easy to find. It might need to be broken up more, depending on the size. The goal is to have this easy to access and read. But, this is the secondary goal for after we get it more complete. For now, let's get this page looking great. \n\nI would also like to get some feedback on what people want to see. You are all the community, and these pages are largely for you. Alberto and I want them to be accessible and useful. What do you think? Should we keep the wiki as one page so it is easy to find? Should we split it up? Should we do something completely different?

I'd be especially interested in storytelling workshops delivered by women from MENA region to their European friends, finding interesting and suitable modes of preserving and presenting stories. \n\nThis way we could offer support based on the projects we would for sure like to concentrate our energy on in the future. \nLet me know if it makes sense @anique.yael and @alberto if you find it useful - for now, the application is very brief, but I could assist a bit with the vague idea for the first submission and then join for the second stage as well.", "created_at": "2017-12-13 09:47:28.419956", "updated_at": "2017-12-13 09:47:28.419956", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 276, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 2.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2379, "user_id": 1423, "topic_id": 2346, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi everyone;\n\nI am writing to update you on the construction work\u00a0progress.\n\nThe construction company\u00a0has finished to realize the electrical system.\u00a0They realized the internet facility on the first floor.\u00a0They have some problems on the ground floor, because it is difficult to create Internet facility in the caves.\u00a0\n\nThe company has clean from weeds external stairs and the first floor balcony.\n\nThe bathrooms on the first floor are complete.\n\nWe\u00a0did move a step to the eventual realization of the kitchen on the first floor.\u00a0At this time we have attacks of the kitchen in both plans.\n\nThe carpenters are repairing the broken fixtures.\n\nFinally today have started to paint the rooms of the first floor.\n\nP.S. sorry guys but I had some troubles updating the previuos post so I had to make a new one :-))\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-15 15:20:15", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 03:41:34.230322", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 345, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40024, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 7797, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Oh and **Sample Advisory Board**\n\n* Nanjira Sambuli \u2013 researcher, policy analyst, advocacy strategist and Digital Equality Advocacy Manager at the Web Foundation (digital colonialism, gender equality, policy)\n* Cindy Regalado \u2013 University College London (citizen science, collaborative network infrastructures)\n* Malika Hamidi \u2013 theorist and activist (Muslim gender studies, policy advocacy)\n* Beth Simone Noveck \u2013 GovLab (digital governance, public interest)\n* Michel Bauwens - P2P Foundation (open data, commons, peer-to-peer networks)\n* Baram (Ramy) Kim - Open Oakland/Code for America (open data, smart health) \n* Rachel Aronoff - Hackerium (researcher, educator, biohacker)\n* MENA civil society / policy TBD", "created_at": "2017-12-06 19:05:07.816430", "updated_at": "2017-12-13 11:52:47.181109", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 88, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 23.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [40023], "is_liked_by": [3704], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40084, "user_id": 3704, "topic_id": 7797, "post_number": 14, "raw": "just one more point: if water quality is really the main goal, we should try to also get some chemistry collaborator(s), in order to look into other elements besides microbes, like lead and arsenic, which are of great concern.\nI would love to find a DIY lead detection method!\nno need to apologise, Alberto!\n:)", "created_at": "2017-12-08 06:05:46.208986", "updated_at": "2017-12-08 06:05:46.208986", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 55, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 57.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22069, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3620, "post_number": 6, "raw": "you know, I hadn't even realised this list existed.

I see them as developing stuff _for their own use_ , and then releasing it as open source. FLOSS is not powered by altruism, simply by not being a jerk: once I have written the code, why not let you use it too? It's not like I lose anything, my code will still work for me, no matter how many people use it. In some cases, people might coordinate a bit: if we both need some piece of code, you might take on a part of it, I might take on another, and we both end up having running code faster and at lower effort. And finally, for over 10 years large tech companies (IBM, for example) are main contributors to open source projects. Linux, for example: it's cheaper to contribute to Linux than to develop their own proprietary OS. \n\nSo, I struggle to see a direct conflict between helping your uncle and writing open source code. You are going to write the code anyway, for your work. Writing it takes the same time. Question is only, will you let others use it.\n\nAside: in some projects ( Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap... but that's not software) you have a minority of very committed people that enter a lot of the content. They _do_ have a conflict with helping their uncle.

Spoiler: you are not going to like it. Stross goes straight to the endgame which is an economy where software agents produce for, and sell to, other software agents. No humans needed, we are just too slow.

I have the same reaction you do to trying to follow the details, especially on the \"left hand\"/central bank clearing side.\n\nI'll just put this here - and warn that it would need a lot more work to substantiate - but the clearing relationships are really a legacy of the older gold standard relationships, and effectively represent the vestigal statistical multiplexing that used to go on between gold and physical notes. When i inadvertantly \u00a0built a simulation of the banking system that didn't include them (so bank transfers were just direct transfers of deposited money) the system was a lot more stable. However, whether it would be practical to implement that, and what it would do to the economy is anybody's guess.\n\nBut yes, i think it's vital we understand this system properly - especially if we're going to be asked to periodically bail it out to the tune of billions, and i don't honestly think we do right now.\n\nI'm not really sure at this time, exactly how the behaviour of the multiplexing arrangement between the bank's clearing mechanisms, and the customer deposits, really interacts with the economy. My strong suspicion is that it mostly acts as a rather artificial bottleneck on whatever would have happened anyway, but I need to build a more detailed simulation to explore that.\u00a0\n\nThe bottom line though, is that it's relatively easy for the central bank to intervene to sort out the liquidity problems that the Target2 represents, and it's also comparitively cheaper owing to the leverage between the clearing mechanisms and the customer deposits in the systems. (Although i think it also raises a huge, what is money? question as well.)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-03 16:56:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.003189", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 318, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12018], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30452, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 1662, "post_number": 23, "raw": "<b>Plant uses</b>\n\nYes searching by uses would be most.... usefull ;) - and I guess maybe go beyond just plants?\n\nI guess part the reason for whisky is its anti bacterial action (they use alcohol hand gel in hospitals here in the UK now rather than washing hands with soap and hot water).\u00a0 I regularly use salt water on wounds - crushed garlic is good once bleeding stops.\n\nI wonder if there is something out there that is already doing this?\u00a0 There are certainly lots of good data sources available on the net - just need collating/curating\n\nThe Plants for a Future database linked in my last post does provide search by use (I just tried a search for antiseptic in their search box) Sadly you cant add new entries to that database.\n\nMaybe a good project to start on Appropedia???\n\nI guess Appropedia is doing this already - just for all uses - not just medical???\n\nI leave this here for now as my head is starting to hurt.....\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-11 09:44:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.679644", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 183, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13462], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40263, "user_id": 4063, "topic_id": 7833, "post_number": 1, "raw": "During the \u201c2018 UNESCO Chair Conference on Technologies for Development\u201d I will co-chair the session on \u201cOpen science: an opportunity for the global south?\u201d I guess it can be good if edgeryders and members of the community to submit an abstract.

This categorization is mostly my own fault: when I read the book, it looked like Le Guin had simply dragged-and-drop Anarres's economic system from the planned economy playbook, and focused on imagining a story set at the interface between a \"capitalist\" planet and a \"socialist\" one. She writes in the early 1970s, when planned economies had their own university courses and journals. They were also not sci-fi at all, as about a third of the planet run a planned economy of one type or the other. Then, no one has bothered to edit the wiki and move the book up into the \"SF economics proper\" section. But my opinion may be a minority one: the entry has a link to [this blog post](https://www.humansandnature.org/economy-giorgos-kallis) with an economic analysis of Anarres.

We are also going to be able to say --- people need a place to work (and live) that gives them a sense of community.

Basically, it is a collection of long articles that try to address the ideas of Language and how it is shaped by the markets/communities it develops in and how certain communities put more value in certain forms of language (Do you know a friend who writes grant proposals ;)) than others and how this investment in language  sort of erodes the natural and spontaneous language that was existent and still is where language is left to develop on its own and not artificially fed to children.\n\nAnother of his articles deals with the concept of velocity and speed and how speed defines the movement of those commuting at that speed, discussing the risks and expenses of having faster commuting at the expense of more slow travel, also how as society gradually ups it's speed it becomes necessary to indulge in high speed commuting as well in order to keep up thus leading to the increase in speed leading to an increase in the welfare of those who are commuting , it actually leads to a decrease in the welfare of those who are now forced to commute longer to reach further distances to do their day to day routines and life. He also argued that above a certain speed (around bike speed), the process of commuting actually had a negative effect, while highlighting the entirely different experience of slow travel.\n\nThere is also a nice book called The Shallows by Micheal Carr, where he discusses the effects of social media and computers and devotes a section looking into the effect of the reading and writing medium on the reader and writer and their brains, which in turn leads to changes in the content that users read/write as an effect of adopting the new medium(s).", "created_at": "2018-01-16 12:18:59.671737", "updated_at": "2018-01-16 12:18:59.671737", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 319, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 93.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3811, 3293, 1935], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41266, "user_id": 3293, "topic_id": 7840, "post_number": 13, "raw": "thank you a lot for sharing this knowledge, will get into that later :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2018-01-17 11:52:10.945311", "updated_at": "2018-01-17 11:52:10.945311", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 7.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [41236], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41267, "user_id": 3293, "topic_id": 7840, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Hey @noemi i love Mary & Max, one of my all time favorite animation movies.

You could probably talk about, I don't know, Markov chains in \"natural and spontaneous language\", but that would be crippingly slow. I used \"crippingly\" in full awareness: science makes progress by consolidating earlier, more basic intuitions into handy concepts (like \"Markov chain\") that can be reused as building blocks for the next level of complexity up. That includes inventing specialized language. If you did not do that, you could not move beyond concepts two or three levels  up the very simplest ones. An engineering equivalent is: requiring people to build any device starting only from a block of metal and an energy source, instead of assembling pre-components such as microchips and then re-using them into phones or cars or musical instruments. \n\nI am aware that some specialized languages are only connotative (\"I use these words, therefore you can trust me to be a certain kind of person\").

That server contains the edgeryders.eu website and about 10 other, smaller websites. The Discourse package prices are for \"managed instances\", where you don't have to care for setting up and updating the Discourse software.\n\nIn your case, if you want to self-host Discourse and not spend much effort on setup etc., a Docker based host like [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) seems a good idea. Because DIscourse is supplied as ready-to-install Docker images officially, while installing it yourself on a vanilla Linux system is possible but took us some time to figure out.

For small hosted communities  like your forum, this does not require us to get a larger hosting package. So I would imagine that we only charge an initial fee for the whitelabelling setup and a per-hour rate in case any support / development / installation work is requested by the hosted community during the hosting.

The books are my own personal journey of learning and discovery, so I don\u2019t claim any of what I have to say is new. But this is it. \n\nThe core insight I discovered is that the only reality is life and death and the natural cycles and systems that arise from mortality. Everything else \u2013 the concept of a \u2018Fair Land\u2019,  or any other vision of how human beings interact with each other and the rest of life on Earth, arises from human imagination. It\u2019s a story. It\u2019s only reality derives from the fact that a sufficient number of people believe the same story that it has agency in human society. It is \u201ctrue\u201d because we behave as if it is \u201ctrue\u201d.\n\nSo \u201ccapitalism\u201d is a story, and \u201ccommunism\u201d is a story. The whole body of economic theory is a collection of stories. \n\nIf economics were a science, the stories would be continually challenged by rival theories. We would be looking at what happens when those stories are enacted, and how closely aligned the lived experience is to the theory. We would be continually adjusting the theory in the light of new information. But once we drew battle lines between the rival camps of \u201cleft-wing politics\u201d and \u201cright-wing politics\u201d that was never going to happen. Each side claimed ownership of the \u2018truth\u2019 and saw theories which disproved their own tenets as enemies to be shot down, suppressed or denied. \n\nThat\u2019s not science. That\u2019s religion. The \u2018continual growth\u2019 theory of capitalist economics and the rampant, nihilistic consumerism it drives has the same hold on human imagination as any other heirarchical religion which sets up groups of humans as interpreters of God\u2019s will. It cannot be challenged. Criticism is blasphemy. Dissent is a punishable crime. If the lived experience does not fit the theory, those in power (which, in a democracy, can simply be the majority of ordinary people) would rather deny the lived experience than adjust the theory. \n\nThe first thing we need to do therefore is to make economics a science, rooted in reality. We need to define its aim \u2013 which I suggest is to create a system that enables human beings to survive, and live peaceably alongside each other (since we have the capability to destroy ourselves and the planet if we don\u2019t live peaceably alongside each other.)  The economic system we create to achieve that needs to continually be taking soundings against reality to adjust the theory so that it functions as a chaotically adaptive system able to work within the constraints of the chaotic adaptive system we call \u201clife\u201d. Kate Raworth\u2019s \u201cDoughnut Model\u201d captures this far more learnedly than I can. \n\nHowever, to lose the stranglehold of consumer capitalism and make the human  behaviour change necessary for the survival of life on Earth, we need to be telling ourselves different stories. We need to go back to the root of reality, and re-discover our spiritual connection to warp and weft of life and death. \n\nThe story I subscribe to is that every human being is a sovereign individual. But we can only realise our potential as sovereign individuals by acknowledging that we are part of the chaotic adaptive system of life on Earth. That is what should govern our actions.  When our actions negatively impact others and the natural world around us, they negatively impact on us too. We feel it in our bodies. It creates anguish in our large brains, to which different personality types respond in various ways \u2013 arrogant and aggressive denial, helpless despair and cynicism, or a courageous resolve to remain true to reality and re-write the stories we\u2019re telling ourselves. \n\nHumans are social animals - we cannot function as individuals without connecting to each other and to the culture shaped by our ancestors. But sovereignty cannot belong both to an individual and a nation. Thinking of ourselves as British or American, French or Russian, black or white, male or female, is helpful for building a sense of community, for understanding our past and how we belong together, but it is not helpful when it becomes exclusive and arrogant, when it starts telling a story that my group is superior to your group, or, worse, that my group has a right to steal the future from every other group. Culture and community should be about celebrating our humanity, not about oppression and dominion. \n\nThat\u2019s about as good a summary as I can come up with.", "created_at": "2020-10-20 14:27:48.839710", "updated_at": "2020-10-20 14:27:48.839710", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 765, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 43.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85312], "is_liked_by": [4, 6639], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40969, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 7856, "post_number": 9, "raw": "YEAH SUPER SAP:\nhttps://entropyresins.com/product/super-sap-100-1000/", "created_at": "2018-01-05 03:15:53.848858", "updated_at": "2018-01-05 03:15:53.848858", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 29, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24898, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2272, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Uh-oh</b>\n\nDamn.

The idea is to *not* maximize the discounted expected value of wealth, but rather \"what will happen to my physical wealth as time goes by\". This is because the expected value is computed as an average of what happens to the same individual, who is taking a gamble, across multiple universes in which the gamble influencing her wealth (a random variable, a priori identical in all parallel universes) had different a posteriori realizations. \n\nIn ergodic systems, the discounted expected values (the discounted value of the realization of the random variable average across all these parallel universes) and the average over time of the individual's wealth are the same. But most systems  are not ergodic; systems in disequilibrium are almost always non-ergodic. \n\nI will leave you to the article to enjoy the argument.

But, two anecdotes that stayed with me:\n\n* Anecdote 1. Company X sets up a secure intranet. You log in with a username and password. The password has to be complex: at least 16 characters, at least one small letter, one big letter, one number, one symbol, one pentacle with an invocation of Chtulhu, a drop of blood of the users' firstborn, and so on. Result: employees write their passwords on post-its and stick the post-its on their monitor's frame. \n* Anecdote 2. The computer system of the Swedish public health has a burdensome secure login (see above). Logged in users are also automatically logged out if they do not do anything for 10 minutes. Swedish doctors respond by instructing their nurses to move the mouse every 9 minutes, so they will remain logged in. \n\nTentative conclusions:\n\n* Security is expensive. Think before you add any security. Do you really need it? \n* When the makers of security are not also its users, there is a \"reverse moral hazard problem\". If the strong password was not enforced, the infosec technologist  gets the blame for breaches. If the secure system is so difficult to use that people circumvent it to use insecure solutions, the *users* get the blame for breaches. If you are the infosec technologist, making an unusable system is the dominant choice, because it lets you off the hook. \n* Computer systems (absolutely *not* only their security aspects) are often seen by their intended users  as instruments of oppression, like in the Swedish example. When that happens, rather than making them secure it would be a good idea to ask why that is, and if those system could not be redesigned or disposed of altogether.", "created_at": "2020-11-22 21:33:31.566299", "updated_at": "2020-11-23 09:02:58.032544", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 314, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 21.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [87380], "is_reply_to": [87380], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87460, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 14909, "post_number": 2, "raw": "California has 24 hour liquor stores.

By that I include the already planned projects (around coffee, surf...). But could be included also quite everything linked to both the local community and ER commitment to the #commons.\n\nIt also is the opportunity to link a little more and further with Owen's post about creating a content/media platform.\nBecause, and this was in the core of the initial project, we still intend to document as much as possible the project, anthropographically, in the most various ways we can.\n\nFor instance, I'd like to map the local fresh food cycle: resources, places, people, companies, prices, and perspectives.\nFor that I would have to check markets, talk to people, learn things, collect data on all that. And I want to document what I'm collecting.\nThat way it will be possible for anybody in the team/ER community/local community use that data (open data) or methodology for another project or to continue the current one. That, as some point by extension to all the projects of each members of the team, create a network of some sort (data + media content), the very old school way.\n\nWhich leads us to the final point: the creation of a meshnet and festival around that might be one of the key project in the future. As soon as we collected and worked on several projects with the ER and local communities, I'm pretty sure that such a network will appear as the main step forward to gather everything in a decentralized, collective and shared way. It's just a question of time.\n\n\nI also wanted to confirm that this project will be carried without any ideologies, meaning that we won't use any terms and words that implies a political stand or another. Even if, of course, we stand and care about the values they might carry somehow. We need this neutral-as-possible stand in our terminology, and we need it in the way we document the project.\nThis is the best way to me, for the local community to get involved fully and to feel free to take the handle on the project and appropriate it for itself.\nIt is also needed to avoid as much as possible the interference/ingerence effect that we, as \"exotes\", could have on the local community and ecology. It is important to get and keep in our minds, tools, terminologies and methodologies, that we're here not to disturb but to enhance. (Sorry to sound like an moral preak... But nobody, including me, reminded this crucial aspect of any project since we started this one)\n\nI'll rename this thread and posy details about the liner, things to have to be done, schedule, and

Alternative Economic  Development:\n*Social Aspects of sustainability I SDGs - * including the issue of value capture and future of work (e.g. data as labour)* as well as fundamental rights and social sustainability, as well as polarisation, not only in terms of market power, but also in terms of North- South, rich-poor, haves and have-nots*\n\nOur entry points: Economies , Profit and Power , Policy tensions between resilience, sustainability and growth\n\n<hr>\n\n### Ethno results\n\n* **alternatives to surveillance capitalism and sharing economy:**  \nWe have a lot going on around \u201calternatives to surveillance capitalism and sharing economy\u201d. See our [NGI Code Review Wiki](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ngi-code-review-wiki-legacy/14458/18) for a nice detailed overview, e.g: t\u2019s clear even at this level that the use of  `personal data`  sets up a  `trade-off`  for a lot of participants. In  `decision-making`  about sharing or protecting  `personal data`  , community members are  `considering larger context`  around its use and  `assessing the impact`  of the trade-off.  `cost`  is also a key consideration.  `Personal data`  also connects strongly, if we move south, to  `agency`  , in a highly illustrative cluster with  `control`  and  `user experience`  . We see, again, trade-offs set up \u2013 between  `user control`  and  `user experience`  , raising questions about what one gets when one gives up  `personal data`  , and how much control is possible. Community members also raise questions about the effort and  `cost`  of controlling personal data in the current environment, when responsibility is highly individualised (  `individualising responsibility`  is a salient code at a lower level of co-occurrences). ALSO  `open source`  also strongly connects with  `privacy`  , an extremely central node in the conversation.  `privacy`  connects back to  `personal data`  , and we see an illustrative network of privacy concerns articulated by the community: around  `smart cities`  and  `human rights`  ,  `covid-19`  and  `contact tracing`  , and as aforementioned,  `trade-off`  and  `decision-making`  . A salient theme is the question of how to weigh up privacy trade-offs, in order to make optimal decisions about one\u2019s own data privacy. What does it  `cost`  ? There is  `uncertainty`  around how extensive  `surveillance`  is, and a  `distrust`  of the information that one is given about these technologies, which makes making quality decisions about these issues difficult for community members. We also talk about these themes in [our preliminary findings](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ngi-ethnography-preliminary-findings-october-2020/14542): Some operators are turning to  `technological solutions`  like  `apps`  to monitor their facilities and regulate members\u2019  `access control`  . This raises some questions about  `privacy`  but operators seem to find access control apps to be the most practical option for the moment.\n\n\n### Selected \"best of\" posts: https://edgeryders.eu/tag/alternative-economic-development\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/regional-policies-in-the-eu-from-convergence-to-exploration/14576 + https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-participatory-regional-policies-could-contribute-to-the-emergence-of-post-carbon-economic-models/12598 , https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-we-can-learn-from-messina-s-economic-model/14424, https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-catalan-integral-cooperative-another-alien-economy-on-earth/13876/12 , https://edgeryders.eu/t/on-modern-monetary-theory-sci-fi-and-where-to-look-for-the-violence/14048\n\n<hr>\n\n## 2.

I largely agree with Alberto that there's an ecological guilt of humanity throughout history \u2026 it just wasn't that bad while people didn't have all this tech to amplify their actions.\n\nOne new thought: what's relevant is only the net effect on nature. The good (repair, cleanup and restoration) can always offset the bad, except for cases of species extinction. So while humans destroy parts of the earth beyond recognition, other humans may find ways to create ecological diversity in other parts _beyond_ what nature could do if left alone. Think ecosystem restoration work, and then something on top: ecosystem creation. If the net effect of all humans is positive for ecological diversity, no reason to grieve about humanity's very existence on Earth.\n\nThat is of course far off, but I found it an interesting approach to the problem. Because it's just unrealistic to regulate everyone into not harming nature. The same applies to climate change: if a part of humanity would care to (profitably!) remove the CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere that the other part of humanity is releasing there \u2013 problem solved.\n\nI'm not yet done with thinking how that could be done practically, mainly saying this as a new way to think about countering ecological destruction. But it's not completely unfeasible: think CO<sub>2</sub> concentration technology and lots and lots of [seawater greenhouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater_greenhouse) in desert areas. The CO<sub>2</sub> enriched air inside the greenhouse makes the plants grow faster (which is the most important property of modern greenhouses, but currently done with a natural gas burner). The products are fruits, nuts, vegetables, and biomass, which would be partially charred and partially composted to create long-term stable soil with lots of carbon in it for even more such greenhouses \u2026", "created_at": "2017-08-31 17:15:30.962269", "updated_at": "2017-08-31 17:33:41.609620", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 354, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 67.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [35118], "is_reply_to": [35118, 35150], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23227, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4052, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Exporting comments is done now.

Such model could then be applied to the whole building, street, district turning the REEF into a prototype which can be repeated in other places creating mini hubs.

For now I start with this one issue.*\n\n**Full time-equivalent Person Months**, abbreviated in PMs, are a unit of human effort. Saying that doing something requires an effort of 1 PM means that one person can do it in a month of full time work. The amount of PMs is calculated as \n```\nunits_of_time_worked x number_of_people_working\n```\nNotice that PM is *not* measured in `persons/month`, but in `persons x month`. \n\nFor example, imagine that a certain task requires three people who work two days a week for 10 months. The number of PMs required is:\n\n```\n3 x (2/5) x 10 = 12\n\n```\nthree people, working 2 out of every 5 days, for 10 months. \n\nThe European Commission considers that there are 1,720 productive hours in a year ([source](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/support/faq;keywords=/3246)). Therefore, `1 PM = 1,720/12 = 143.33 hours`.\n\nIn EU research, partners need to budget both in human effort and in money. To do that, each partner is required to indicate their average cost of labor. In the example above, if you imagine that the full cost of a PM is 5,000 EUR, that task will require `12 x 5,000 = 60,000 EUR`.\n\nIn Edgeryders, we prefer to attribute the same PM cost (6,000 EUR) to everyone, making exceptions only for the most junior people.", "created_at": "2019-02-12 20:57:31.843126", "updated_at": "2019-02-14 12:26:01.847240", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 253, "wiki": true, "reads": 21, "score": 369.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 5, 3067], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41070, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 7866, "post_number": 10, "raw": "[quote=\"alex_levene, post:8, topic:7866\"]\nNot to worry about the travel budget, that was expected.

Yet it is almost impossible to find a satisfactory definition of what a local economy is; how it is defined or delineated; or how it might be modelled. Much of the discourse that exists turns out, on examination, to be not \u2018economic\u2019 at all, but a proxy for other concepts such as community, a process that weakens and distracts attention from the actual understanding and planning of robust, sustainable local economies. This dissertation adapts a model for mapping capital flows from the work of the critical geographer David Harvey and applies it to the highly contested plan for \u2018redeveloping\u2019 the Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre in south London. Mapping the developers\u2019 proposals in this way demonstrates the almost wholly extractive nature of the local economy that the scheme would produce. The paper then uses the same technique to design an alternative scheme that potentially creates a genuinely \u2018local\u2019 economy. Whilst - taken as a whole - this option is admittedly utopian, it is nevertheless constructed from a number of actually existing alternative models of ownership, collaborative and cooperative enterprise, re-municipalisation and so forth that are already happening across a range of cities and towns in the UK, Europe and beyond.\n\nand the full dissertation (if you have the time to read 10K words?) is here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12rwDFKxhhMglXvqajjiXZbNy4eC1GPti/view?usp=sharing", "created_at": "2019-02-04 18:20:30.803458", "updated_at": "2019-02-04 18:20:30.803458", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 261, "wiki": false, "reads": 30, "score": 71.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [50537], "is_liked_by": [4, 3067], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79199, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 74, "raw": "Happy midsommarafton!

It raises a huge number of socio economic issues, which impact our quality of life in so many ways. Two biggest I see are health and finances. Those two are some of the pillars of our wellbeing but they are all connected.\nFor me, if a person is healthy and has financial stability, it starts growing and thinking of others. Society as the last pillar would be us, being useful and contributing to the community much more, forging stronger relationships.\n\nA lot of people voiced their concerns about life in rural areas. Lack of infrastructure, not enough entertainment or cultural activities, much less intense social life, for many it is lack of job opportunities etc...this really shows the difficulty in bringing younger people in.\nWhen I see abandoned lands and ruins, I see an opportunity to create [something different](https://www.regenvillages.com/). It's like a second chance, as every village could become a town, and later some kind of a city...OR NOT. Why not create new models for future? \nWhen I see small villages, with mainly older population and limited young population, I see potential for [learning](https://www.effekt.dk/regenvillages) and growth.\nThere is abundance in our deserted or low populated countryside but it all revolves around human potential. In current state, it is also our biggest obstacle.\nThe issue I see nowadays is that the villages we imagine today are the villages we see when we go on vacation and the villages we see in the movies (rednecks in the only village cafe, drinking  themselves to death, looking to beat somebody up, few teenagers dreaming of promises in big cities...you literally hear the loneliness in the winds outside and smell the cow manure). \n@irene_1 touched that point [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/registrations-poprebel-food-localisation-30-october-2020/14326/85?u=jasen_lakic) \n[quote=\"irene_1, post:85, topic:14326\"]\nOn the idea of being closer to the land I\u2019m rather thinking about my own experience as I would love to be more connected to nature as a youngish :smiley: and never-been-farmer urban, meaning rather spending systemically more time in rural areas while not giving up urban life.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that I should just move to a smaller city or to a peripheral suburban area looking at my kitchen garden and cows ruminating from my window :sweat_smile: I\u2019m rather pointing at the possibility of suburban citizens to actively participate and more profoundly be aware of the food chains that support our (urban) livelihoods.\nI\u2019m thinking for instance about seasonal work that could be taken over by workers in the city (see btw what happened with [desbrasdansnosassiette](https://desbraspourtonassiette.wizi.farm/) during the spring lockdown) and how the city could be useful for rurals on the other hand, on top of our natural role of \u2018compost makers\u2019 which is still far from being accomplished in most cities (see [the latest report](https://issuu.com/urbanecologycentre/docs/20190613_phosphore_rapport_scientif) from \u2018operation phosphore\u2019 for Brussels).\n[/quote]\n**Those a great points and I will expand on them further.**\n\nHere is the standard village model today (the prevalent one):\n![Village development|690x180](upload://ipnind1Tk6uQ6MlOIG5NX0m7Yba.jpeg) \nThe issue here is, it's hard to attract young people as they have legitimate concerns, which I put as basic prerequisite of infrastructure, health and activities. Human potential is everything.\nNo human potential, no use of available resources, no core village economy and no potential of growing and **diversifying it**.\nIn this very moment there are tens of thousands of rural entrepreneurs all over Europe, trying to start or expand their activities, and they cannot even find somebody to work with. On the other hand, we have so many unemployed people in big cities.\nI tried to build a solution for that, didn't work out but not because it wasn't needed :slight_smile:. It deserves a separate post, which I will create as promised @MariaEuler\n**There is absolutely no reason why the above model should be the one to follow or limit ourselves to. There are infinite possibilities available now, here are just some of them**\n![Village development 2|574x690, 100%](upload://zmdaJysjflgmzYvfNvl4X0P0tWW.jpeg) \n\nThat is why I will go back to Irene's way of thinking, as I have been in that same boat for years... switching between Brussels and Croatian rural areas. That kind of lifestyle is quite compatible too, if you are not planning serious projects in the countryside which require a lot of attention.\nI have a company in Brussels. My illustrators are from Poland and Russia, graphic designers are from Poland and Serbia, narrator from UK, animator UK + me, manufacturing Germany for most of it, some parts Poland and Lithuania, prototypes or demanding custom parts production is in China. Some prototypes and custom pieces are made in Brussels too. Product reviewers/content creators are all over the world. Shirts illustrator is in Serbia, manufacturer is in UK, flyers are made in Holland, banners in Belgium, stall walls for fairs made in Italy. My testers are in Belgium, Serbia and Croatia.\nI have never met most of them, some I met once or twice (only testers I meet regularly).\nThis is just one small company. Do you see now why today we can do so much more from the rural areas as well? My company could just as well be anywhere.\n\nThere will always be people enjoying work in nature and with nature, me being one of them. They can produce **higher quality food** which we would **pay much less** if we lived in the neighborhood.\nWhat rural areas need are people who see there is no limit to what they can do. People who can bring different perspectives, experiences, knowledge and skills the rural regions so badly need.\nImagine the innovation if you would have all these people living in villages or small towns, talking and working with the farmers and local craftsmen and mixing their experiences to find new solutions for old problems...or relearn old solutions for new problems? ;)\n\nWhat I encounter today are just few people like that in villages, or none at all. People with great insight and vision, but they literally have nobody to talk to. I share some of my ideas with them, to help them or often just hear their ideas on the subject, and end up staying so much more. They don't want to let me leave and always thank me so much for such a great conversation, which they cannot usually have. That shows us the states of villages and why they greatly need migration of young professionals from the cities.\n\nEven if we started with a small coworking/coliving settlement and none of us specifically wanted to be  a farmer, there are so many solutions:\n1. Well we would have to be really isolated not to have access to food we could simply buy :slight_smile:\n 2. We could easily have shared gardens, there are so many examples of that. Even better, create shared permaculture gardens, which are mostly self sustainable ecosystems requiring much less effort. We could have everything we need with each of us having to contribute few hours of work in it per week.\n3. We could make an open call for people to join us, specifically people who would enjoy doing something like that. They would have a guaranteed market next door :slight_smile: . It's a fact people come and stay when they feel the right environment for prospering, just like any other organism on this planet.\n\nConsidering the current evolution of remote working, much worse living conditions in urban areas and fragility of the system which will be exposed as of next year if this continues, I expect a lot of people will move or want to move to rural areas.\nI would look to be in a 30 min range by car to a nearby city, just as the village of my grandparents is from my home town, Zadar.\nIf you move around Brussels, there are high chances you will be moving for 30 minutes :slight_smile:, so again it is really just a matter of perspective.\nI also can travel via Zadar airport to so many places, the world is small today :) \n\nAlso, as @nadia already said, cultural activities or sports etc depend only of us, the human potential. As the communities like this one would grow, so would opportunities for every kind of activity.\n\nRight now there is a lot of money being funneled towards rural development and innovation. Internet has been recognised long time ago as basic human right and we see the evolution today. It is possible to have a high speed internet in so many more rural areas than 3-4 years ago. There is money, there are opportunities, the biggest obstacles are lack of knowledge, shift in paradigm needed, and sometimes it is the lack of local will. \nFrom what I saw in Croatia, 90% of the local managing authorities will support you if you present the project in the right way and involve the locals from the start. They always look for an angle for them, of course, so compromises have to be made (if nothing else to let them take the credit haha). Mostly they really see the direct benefits for them too, so you will likely first encounter skepticism but then support. \n\nRight now Croatia is going through centralisation, it is one of the main conditions for billions of euros in funding from EU. That means decision making will shift to bigger cities, which will make it a bit harder locally but at the same time offer better support for bigger projects, involving 5-6 municipalities for example.\n\nI believe the keys here are: \n1. Creating core groups or catalysts\n2. Bottom up first, so starting innovative businesses and building up\n3. Planned development through the authorities \n**And in exactly that order.**\n\nIt is hard to justify investing in a scarcely populated village with the authorities, but it can be done. Once you have the basic infrastructure, increase visibility through some public programs involving media, showcase all the positives (and there are so many) and the potential, I know many more people would come. More people = more money and ability to support community beneficial development. By community I mean, choosing an optimal place to build something which will benefit 20 communities in a 15 km radius.\nIt's like Copenhagen mayor answered the question on why so many Danes use bicycles in the capital:\n\"If you build more roads, people will use more cars. If you build more bicycle paths, they will use more bicycles\".\nThere are communities being [created](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKnDDavIqBKZuvgQtYAJsA) or already [functioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_9nam7A0To&ab_channel=TEDxTalks) like that all over the world. There are many examples of good practices out there, which can be adapted to local needs. We don't need to reinvent the wheel in many cases.\n**Now, to a personal example:**\n\nI opened a family business in Croatia in January this year. I threw my net as well more than a year ago, the result being forming of a mastering group of 6 individuals. We all have companies, both in Croatia and abroad. We work in different fields but we have one thing in common: passion for countryside and sustainable development.\n\nI already bought lands and old stone houses I need, but I am buying more by January next year. Meaning as of March next year I will be speeding up everything. At the same time, we plan development as a group, meaning we plan our main or side activities to be complementary. Basically we can cooperate on many levels and we will contribute to each other success.\n\nThe result of this year's activities is connecting 3 villages to the water and electricity grid. There are few more in line. That is the result of persistence and patience with local authorities. If they decide to sabotage us, we will skip them and go few levels up. Then they will be pressured from above and things will start happening again...not extremely hard.\n I plan on developing family wine making further and experimenting with [regenerative farming](https://www.eitfood.eu/projects/the-regenerative-agriculture-revolution-2020) solutions and implementation of circular economy locally, increasing efficiency.\nThere is an interesting [article](https://medium.com/sciforce/smart-farming-or-the-future-of-agriculture-359f0089df69) on smart farming here but, it focuses only on efficiency and productivity. It will also mostly benefit the biggest players. I don't believe in that future. I believe in future where a lot of smaller farmers provide good quality produce for a decent price. They can benefit greatly from smart farming as well.\nFurther I am building a series of homes with few common spaces for fun activities, workshops etc. One maker space for craftsmen as well. I will offer it for rent to people from cities willing to experiment with life in a countryside. I guess they will know after 6 months or a year if they can be happy in such an environment. Ideally, they could spread their knowledge to locals during their stay, whatever that knowledge is. By locals I mean everyone in a 20 km radius as I will make sure the venue is well known very fast :slight_smile: . After that, if they are happy there and want it, I will help them get everything they need to build their own home there.\n\nThat is my experiment, and I am sure it will work really well.\n\nParallel to my project, I will push a regional project (which is the scaled down version of what I already tried building but failed). Its core is promotion of the region (goods and services), network building and bridging the gap between rural and urban areas.\nBy bridging the gap I mean giving valuable information to urban dwellers, like job opportunities and why their quality of life can improve so much in rural areas.\n\n**The biggest obstacle we might need to solve is the disconnection:**\n1. Disconnection between the current image of rural areas and reality in which so much more is possible\n2. Disconnection between rural and urban dwellers (both cultural and information wise)\n3. Disconnection between policy makers and reality of people on the field\n\nFinally, I would like to repeat what Nadia said: most of these issues are solved with human potential so we really just need to network, organise and start doing it. You would be surprised how many people are looking into moving to the countryside and **they would be surprised how happy they could be there** :slight_smile: \n\nI wrote so much already, and I tried to cover the core issues I see, but I am sure I missed things too. I didn't go into the \"system\" part of it as it is complex and part of the much longer term goals.\n**Things I spoke about here can be achieved in 2 years and I will contribute my maximum into making it a powerful example of success.**\n\nWhat are your thoughts on all this?

Testing something like this is right up there with the things we absolutely wanted to try out when setting up our lab. Some initial thoughts, I may be off.\n\nIn my view, there's two clear levels to this: local collaboration and international collaboration. Both are interesting to research seperately, and the combination even more so.\u00a0For good measure, local research groups participating in this are (or should be)\u00a0inevitably autonomous in practical aspects. Save the occasional shipping of a sample to replicate experiments\u00a0or other small stuff like that. This entails that the local element\u00a0will have coordination costs in the form of time, money\u00a0and energy\u00a0to\u00a0keep\u00a0the community and project going through a potentially long and tough research track.\n\nThe big advantage is that all global groups\u00a0are interconnected for the information aspect. The international element\u00a0will probably happen relatively smoothly if the right digital infrastructure and practises are in place, as there is a clear incentive to do so: faster learning, collective intelligence. Coordination costs should be low, there's only information being shared and this is cheap and fast if you have people who keep track of data.\n\nI'm optimistic about the uptake of the project by the community here. The main challenge\u00a0that I see now for us is the\u00a0local coordination cost\u00a0(Ghent or Belgium level TBD).\u00a0I've (tried to) set up, participated in and observed a few similar\u00a0local research collaborations. They all had high coordination costs. This\u00a0insight comes from\u00a0scientific fields that are way less of a pain than biotech/pharma, so I can't see it turning out\u00a0easier than expected. Another challenge is\u00a0gathering relevant insights in terms of process to have some insights at the end of the road. More so when you haven't set it up right at the beginning: having to change process during the project is costly.\n\nFor Open Insulin in SF locally it seems\u00a0to have turned out well and I already discussed some potential pitfalls with @dfko. This is very hopeful.\n\nAs for international collaboration, there's already some stuff in place: filesharing and weekly Skype calls. With the Sydney group recently started there is already a clear synergy.\n\nI think we should have a call about how we can make it happen, @Alberto and anyone else?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-09 18:43:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.210311", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 440, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 11.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24889], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40813, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 7868, "post_number": 13, "raw": "This Yahoo travel article listing [\"11 Must See Travel Spots for 2018\"](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/11-must-see-travel-spots-221519224.html) includes  Essaouira.\n\n\"Travelers who prefer the slow pace of a coastal town over a bustling and dense city will be entranced by Essaouira.

Only a week ago, another group decided to disturb the commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz. This time the event was led by Piotr Rybak, a person already known from burning a puppet of Soros in 2017 and being convicted for that. The group demanded that \"Poland fought the Jews\". The list is a bit longer and terrifying. \n\nI am bringing it here also as a possible source of interesting people and stories to the platform - the Common Theater has invited various organisations, university groups and collectives that work against fascism in Poland to join a one-day discussion and to understand if there is fascism in Poland, and how to deal with the wave of xenophobic, violent acts that shake Polish society.", "created_at": "2019-02-05 20:24:46.458593", "updated_at": "2019-03-04 14:07:11.452133", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 274, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 390.6, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 347, 4773, 4819, 3, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39016, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7597, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Great work, @thomasmboa, it's very useful feedback.

As a result they are now in the \"trough of disillusionment\" phase of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle\">hype cycle</a>.\n\nConsequently: many groups want to run hackathons, and have money to spend on them. They recognize that not all hackathons are equal, and would pay to have their event work well. If edgeryders figures out how to run hackathons that don't suck, we have a skill that's both useful for our own communities, and something we offer as a paid service.\n\nThat said...we aren't there yet. I know I made a <em>lot</em> of mistakes in arranging the website track of the LOTE4 hackathon -- some my own, others from imperfect interactions with the wider event process.\n\nAnd I've not seen much concrete description of what makes a hackathon \"harmonious\". I love the label, but I don't think we've yet done the work to justify it. [or possibly, there's a huge amount of work in a corner of this site that I've not yet found]\n\nI'd be keen to work more on this area.

I recently presented ER in Paris and someone from Make Sense community said just that. Talking with <a href=\"/u/ruxandra\">@Ruxandra</a>\u00a0in Bucharest we also agreed to keep creating opportunities for people there to meet, somewhat inspired by the OuiShare events in Paris she was part of. But this we do locally, so it's up to <strong>each of us</strong>.\n\nIf it has to do this <strong>platform</strong> making it easier for us to find each other, let's not suppose that someone will build it. We can of course add this as a conceptual to do in the list of things to fix and improve in 2016 (you know where the tech dev group is), but we'll never agree on a magical feature. E.g. we know people don't fill in user profiles properly, and we had a conversation <a href=\"/t/redesign-the-user-profile-page/1865\">before</a> about geo profiles. Why invest resources into a feature that people don't use? Also, people move around quite a bit, so you never know who's where unless you give it a shout.\n\nAt the level of <strong>projects</strong>, we are learning that consultancy via online conversations and community building is not enough, so a solution we find when writing proposals for funded projects is to bake in as many events and local exchanges in all the projects, and even set up small teams on the ground to organize them - see Brussels, Kathmandu, Bucharest. So it's happening, but there's always someone committed to do it.\u00a0\n\nHope this helps, any other ideas?\n\nAlso, what do people think about the user policy and terms for moving into the ER organisation as members?

I just think highly of you, as an intelligent, educated and capable human being. So following my own logic of course, those are the 2 options I could consider plausible. When I see automatons around, not thinking and just wondering around in their everyday tasks, it certainly bothers me but I am used to it by now. When I come to a platform like Edgeryders where I like to think we have a community of very open minded people, creatives, entrepreneurs and scientists, and encounter almost the same attitude, I get VEEEERY WORRIED ABOUT HUMANITY.\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:32, topic:14462\"]\nIn cases where science has established something beyond reasonable doubt, I even *support* censorship in certain contexts, like education and mass media.\n[/quote]\nAnd I totally agree with this, in certain cases. So why then you don't see a problem in the way media and policy makers are treating the COVID crisis or people giving an alternative opinion? \n\nI gave a lot of specific cases and backed it with sources, just like I will do now again.\nI already wrote in previous post about \n[quote=\"jasen_lakic, post:9, topic:14462\"]\nFunny how Lancet publishes 2 researches claiming hydroxychloroquine is not effective against covid 19 AND it actually increases the death % and all media publish that. A bit later Lancet **retracts** the research as it did not pass the peer review and **very few media publish that fact** .\nHere is the link example https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6/fulltext\n[/quote]\nIn this specific example: based on that Lancet published research French government has banned the use of hydroxychloroquine just 24hours after! Some US states have even allowed pharmacists to **refuse selling it** to patients who had it prescribed by their doctor. WHAT? Does that sound like science to you? A medicine used for 80 years, on over 2 billion people? Based on a study by some incognito monkeys now is harmful?\nAlso, that \"research\" published was such nonsense that it was never gonna pass peer review. Not only that, nobody in the community could  even figure out who are the people behind it...that tells us a lot about their credentials. At the same time we have people like Dr. Didier Raoult (who is a living monument) and organisations like American Frontier Doctors are treating people with hydroxychloroquine successfully. But American Frontier Doctors have their videos taken down by Youtube and their livestream (followed at that time by millions of people, **including me**) interrupted and taken down by Facebook. Do you find that normal?\nWhere is the science there? Is that science or politics and lobbying? So yes, I trust science and scientific method. But when I see examples like this one, which are facts, my  trust in the policy makers goes down drastically.\n\nHow much damage was done by policy makers and media in that case? (Media treated VERY DIFFERENTLY the published study and the retraction of the same). And what is the solution if we have no cure? Well of course it is vaccination...and judging by the articles being placed in media for months now, we will have a yearly vaccine (or vaccines) for it. They, of course keep feeding us articles with titles like \"Human immune system does not work\", \"There is no cure\", and obviously 197823 articles about incoming vaccines.\nDoes it sound like science to you that billions of public money are spent to buy vaccines which haven't even been tested or manufactured, while we have only censured anything contradicting that vaccine-is the-only-solution narrative???\n\nLet me go back to censorship: in specific cases that you stated, I would certainly not censor them. I am a firm believer in open discussion and you know why? Simply because it is more productive. \nLet's take a subject like race superiority:\nWhat happens if you censor the discussion about it? Well it goes underground. Those who believe it will surround themselves with likeminded people, enforcing the belief and creating serious extremism. Not only that but, censorship will give them a higher ground than they will actually have and motive even, proving their \"race is in danger of being wiped out\" blabla all the bshit.\nAs long as you have an open discussion, you cannot lose really. Why? Well because their arguments make no sense and can so easily be dismantled. If you do it publicly or through debate, you will have waaaaaay bigger impact than if you just ban them from talking.\nSpecially if you make blanket statements which make no sense to an average person. They need to see real life examples and there are plenty of those.\nSame goes for creationists and same goes for those who deny climate change is happening.\n\nIt's not the same to not allow certain teachings in public school by the way and **not allow open discussion** about certain things, as is the situation now. \nI cannot trust the same people who censure, do character assassination and downright punish those most relevant to give us information about the subject at hand. People losing their jobs, their licences, being suspended...what is that? Trusting people/organisations using such methods goes against all common sense. Especially when on one side you have an individual who risks everything by saying what they say, and on the other you have organisations gaining so much from saying what they say...\n\nLet's put all current matters aside and just consider censorship. This is how I see it:\nThe powers that be make the population increasingly dependent of the authority, they dumb down the population enforcing obedience and discouraging critical thinking, then they filter and manipulate information to manufacture public consent and THEN THEY JUSTIFY CENSORSHIP saying \"population should not have access to that information as we essentially consider them too dumb to properly process it\". **Sorry but we are either homo sapiens or we are not.** We can't call our species that if we don't believe the members of the species cannot use logic and understand information given to them. \n[quote=\"alberto, post:32, topic:14462\"]\nWith COVID we do not know much yet, it is not a situation like creationism and climate change denial. So, let\u2019s be mentally flexible, entertain all possibilities, and read more meta-studies (like [this ](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02801-8)) and fewer studies. Deal?\n[/quote]\nWell obviously masks work to a degree, that is the most logical thing and I don't see who even said the opposite here. I only said that pieces of cloth people wear nowdays don't make us safe and certainly do more harm than good. **Do you know that these masks are supposed to be used once? So handled once, placed on the face ONCE, removed ONCE and thrown away?** Everyone is bombarding us with \"wear masks\" but who talks about proper use? You know why they don't? Because a lot of active people would **have to use 10 per day** if they don't want to wear them all day long. Who is going to pay for that? Here is a short [guideline](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/factsheet/factsheet-covid-19-how-to-wear-mask.pdf?la=en) but it does not state everything.\nHere is CDC published [result](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6936a5.htm?fbclid=IwAR3zIwGbJ1RPJvVRuxd7J4rE__8xVU1yAz8s2La6vulGmFBfcjyGTVhpbsg#T1_down) of %of people wearing masks who got infected. So 70% of them wore the mask all the time in public, but 40% had close contact with someone who was positive. Also, they considered only symptomatic people, which is very important. 90% of all tests are either mild cases or asymptomatic.\nWhat I find incredible is having children wear them for 9 hours...that makes no sense and is downright harmful. Especially when you consider the mortality rate or effect at all for 0-19 years old. I go back to, protect those who need to be protected, make sure you create all necessary support systems to increase their safety. Do not inflict damage on 99.5% of the population for increased safety of 0.5%. Not only that, with our policies and paranoia we have probably killed way more senior citizens as well...we have definitely killed way more young people (and we will kill so many more) with our policies so far.\nI gave examples for that in previous posts, but there are way bigger consequences.\nI love the example of US demonstrations and people wearing masks there, as the proof masks work. Well we kept the masks all along, so why we see such spike in cases now? How come the covid cases rise so much but flu has all but disappeared? Sorry but don't even need science for that.\nYou talk about masks but, I will talk about PCR tests.\nWhy are we testing the asymptomatic? How reliable are the tests at all? In the article I linked above there is a lot of science and investigation behind it, backed by links to direct sources, by real people staking their livelihood on it. So why do you consider your meta study so much better? Even though I agree with the findings of the study.\n\nWe were testing 30000 people per day lately, ramping up to 60000 people per day. Compared to 10-25 000 in May. If the test is not reliable, and all data shows it is not, why are we basing everything on it? If it is so sensitive, and it is. If it cannot distinguish between various corona viruses, and it cannot. If it gives a covid positive result on a plethora of other diseases, and it does.\n\nOnly now they are deciding not to test the asymptomatic in Belgium, finally.\n\nNow let's go to the manipulation with mortality rates. First of all, **it is a fact** that most people dying of/with it lived longer than the average age expectancy.\nIt is also a fact most of those people had more than one comorbidity. Latest estimates by CDC and few other sources state 6-12% (depending on country) of all who died actually died of covid19.\n\nLet's go now to big financial incentives for declaring covid 19 patients, both positives and dead. Are you aware of that fact? Combine that with the fact a lot less regular patients go to hospitals and tell me, how much integrity is there when people are faced with losing their businesses/jobs during a crisis as this one?\nI have been to hospitals 3 times since the beginning of all this. First 2 times I was there in the peak of the epidemic. I never saw so few people at the hospital...\n\nJust yesterday almost all Croatian media reported \"The youngest case of COVID19 death in Croatia, a 39 year old female\".\nWell guess what, her brother publicly replied asking then why are they spreading lies? She suffered for a long time, had internal organ failures as a result of her condition and she died from internal bleeding finally...\nUnderneath his message there is an incredible number of people reporting they were encouraged by the medical personnel to sign their relative died of covid19 and offered all funeral expenses covered. In Croatia, that is a big deal. In some cases they just received a letter later, informing them the relative died of covid19. All of them had very serious health issues and were not admitted to the hospital for covid19.\nSame is happening in many other countries and medical practitioners are talking about that. I directly know of one case like that in Belgium (late stage cancer battle), so I will cite only that one. But let's wait and see, how many people will come forward. More and more I believe, as bshit of this magnitude cannot stay hidden really.\n\nAlso, why are practitioners stating these things being silenced? Fired, suspended etc? I understand somewhat if they went against the interests of the company they work for and got fired or suspended, but why is mainstream media complicit? Why are platforms like youtube and facebook complicit? Youtube has a lot worse things on there than a doctor or coroner talking about **FACTS** and data manipulation, actually reading from the internal memo. What happened with investigative journalism?\n\nCrazy part is, this whole situation does not affect me much. My family is safe and very independent, no need for masks or anything special. I don't have to wear a mask much. I felt the economic impact as I lost money but it didn't  affect me much. I am not in any danger nor do I feel any pressure there. In fact, I lost around 15 000 euros and by conservative estimates I will make 6-8 times more next year...probably x10. I am just sorry I couldn't continue paying 5 people for their services.\n\nMy only issue is obligatory vaccination and that is what is coming. You think our policy makers would have ordered hundreds of millions of them if it wasn't the case? We will be \"free\" to choose but our lives will pretty much be miserable if we do not take the vaccine.\n\nI am still very upset with the state of the world and if, in my frustration, I sometimes use harsher language than I should - I apologise.", "created_at": "2020-10-20 15:54:13.625946", "updated_at": "2020-10-20 15:54:13.625946", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2365, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 22.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 3, "quotes_posts": [85351, 85347, 85003], "is_reply_to": [85351, 85347, 85003], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31516, "user_id": 31, "topic_id": 1662, "post_number": 39, "raw": "<b>instant communities, ages &amp; health, and help needed w/ examples</b>\n\nThe name \"instant communities\" emerged at the meeting, after networks were reviewed.\n\nI've been thinking about bad pandemic flu for several years, and in that kind of scenario profesional help (where available) would become scarce soon. (Too many patients, while health-care workers are ill themselves.) So that's my bias, and the reason why the idea of \"helping neighbours help each other\" was at the back of my mind.\n\nLooking at it from the point of view of human networks enriched the idea and made it plausible.\n\nThe general vague idea is there would be some kind of booklet &amp; fill-in-the-blanks documents. If you live in a flat with 2.5 other people (where I live, if I recall correctly, family groups here are 3.5 people on average), and there are maybe 7 other flats in the same building, you may know some of the other 24-ish people by name. do you know their medication, risk factors like smoking or exercise, etc? So, if 2-3 people in that group write down the data, and somehow check that everyone's ok say 2-3 times a day, that would mean the elderly, those who live alone, families with several kids, etc, all would have \"multiple eyes\" checking on them frequently enough.\n\nNot exactly an instant community, but a few weeks into the pandemic people might know more about each other.\n\nMaybe.\n\nAnd yes, ages are varied, not just 3 categories. Some older folks are healthier than the young. Some have more time, or more inclination towards taking care of others, etc.\n\nPlus, there could be connections between instant-communities - perhaps 2-3 people in a building could have contact with others in other buildings. (I insist on 2-3 for redundancy, as 1 people might fall ill, but 2-3 simultaneously is less likely.)\n\nI'm looking at the big picture, and to be honest I'm a bit lost. Maybe we should start from the few simple ideas? Instant communities is a big one. Stocking up on insulin (as an example for other medications) is another one. Doctor-community networks need to be fleshed out.

Actually, I think this is probably fairly typical. You tell children from a very young age that they are supposed to become adults with certain characteristics. You tell them \"they must\", \"it's their duty\", because the seduction of money and power does not really work on young children, who don't seem to be particularly interested in abstract things like net worth. Children generally want to be superheroes or circus artists, not investment bankers! So parents play the duty card.

Immer das was fremd ist tut weh. Das erste Mal tut immer weh. Beim Kartenspiel. Das erste Mal verliert man. So ist das auch mit Fl\u00fcchtlingen. Die gr\u00fcne Kiste. Wir hatten eine in der WG.

In den 70ern, die Hippie Bewegung, dann Wallstreit, jetzt ist Scheitern geil. Scheitern ist nicht geil, das geh\u00f6rt dazu, man darf Scheitern nicht zum Ideal erheben. Wenn das passiert verf\u00e4llt man in Aktionismus. Scheitern geh\u00f6rt dazu und ist auch wichtig, aber man darf es nicht erheben und das passiert gerade. Das zweite zum Scheitern.

And thanks @hugi for explaining what really is in the SSB folder on my laptop. \n\nI was thinking about this, and it dawned on me that the European Union's [General Data Protection Regulation](https://eugdpr.org/) was definitely not written with SSB in mind. The GDPR seems to have been written with centralization in mind. For example, if you treat data, you should have a data protection officer. This is someone who stands watch on the data; she is in charge of enforcing the user's rights, like having their data deleted and knowing what uses are being made of said data. \n\nBut with SSB, this model glitches. In fact, there is no SSB. My right of having my data deleted from SSB is unenforceable, because the data are sitting on people's hard drives. These people do not even know they have my data on their hard drive! Most of them, like me, will also have an automated backup procedure. \n\nThe GDPR gives people a right to sue for misuse of their data. But in the case of something like SSB, there is no one to sue. This might be a feature and not a bug: people are expected to think before they post, and when they post they can never un-post. I do not know, it is so orthogonal to the regulatory frame of mind that I struggle to transpose the model to SSB and its federated ilk. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I am a big fan of the GDPR. It was designed to limit the power of large centralized corps, and I am already seeing beneficial effects in this sense. But I don't see how it can provide cover against Norwegian nazis using my laptop as a communication device, or help me keep control of data I share on SSB.

But does this come about because of monopolistic practices?  I'm not so sure.\n\nHere is an interesting section of a newsletter by well regarded VC Benedict Evans:\n\n> At the beginning of this year I wrote an essay called \u2018[How to Lose a Monopoly](https://ben-evans.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b98e2de85f03865f1d38de74f&id=31b06d345e&e=dd5d80e8b2)\u2019, in which I pointed out that when Microsoft replaced IBM as the centre of the tech industry, IBM didn\u2019t disappear, and neither did mainframes. In fact, IBM\u2019s mainframe business carried on growing - its installed base (measured in MIPS) went up 10x from 2000 to 2010. Mainframes and IBM are still there - they just don\u2019t matter anymore. The same happened to Microsoft 15 years later. Microsoft dominated PC operating systems, and that gave it dominance of the broader tech industry, but then PCs stopped being the centre of tech and with it Microsoft, like IBM, became just another big tech company. It\u2019s still a big company, but no-one is afraid of it anymore, and it\u2019s 20 years since anyone started a company to write Windows software. It didn\u2019t lose its monopoly - rather, the monopoly became unimportant.\n> \n> Today, Amazon has won (for now) a certain kind of logistics-based ecommerce, but that\u2019s not the only kind of ecommerce, as Shopify or Net a Porter show. Google won a certain kind of information management, but was utterly unable to have any impact on a new startup called Facebook. Facebook 'won' social and Youtube 'won' UGC video, and yet neither have yet laid a finger on Tiktok. The competitive challenges to big tech companies do not come from someone new doing the same thing - they come from something different.

It's also worth remembering that you can get this kind of communication via the regular optional evening classes (and I suppose via phone) if you feel more is required.\n\nThat being said, more hands on degrees do require larger amounts of synchronous contact, it's telling that the OU offers less of these courses.\n\nDid I choose my subjects because of such concerns? It might have played a role. I'll be doing a few engineering modules soon, several of these modules require travelling to a three-week residential school as such synchronous communication is a necessity for the subject.\n\nWill I feel I've received enough synchronous communication for such a hands-on subject after completing the modules? I suppose I will have to wait and find out.\n\nI have studied sculpture within a brick and mortar university, and even if the course had been offered online, i would likely do so again.\n\nAs you say, for some subjects (the minority) situated learning is essential.

As hackers took the kitchen robot apart in search of new cools hacks, they discovered a microphone, of which no mention was made in the marketing literature, nor in the product documentation.\n\nThe microphone [was not simply forgotten in the tablet around which the MCC is built](https://youtu.be/wHggrMH5Fkk?t=213). It is mounted outside of the table, secured to the chassis for a clearer, unmuffled sound. The chassis itself has a small hole in correspondence of the microphone, for even better results.

I am about to publish a blog post below. Thought this might be a good place to get some eyeballs on it before it is released :slight_smile:, and generally this group might be interested in the subject of how we can build a more open, innovative and user-centric internet. \n\nThanks for sharing your perspective!\n\n------\nWe all have heard it: In order to build something valuable you it has to be 10X better than whats there. It seems like an accepted law of entrepreneurship.\n\nA law so strong that not even Google+, with Billions of backing, could not become a rival to Facebook. Google+ arguably had some features that made it a better service than Facebook.\n\n**This begs the questions if the reasons the 10x law exist actively prevents innovation from happening, why this 'law' exists in the first place and what we can do to change the rules?**\n\n## Everyone knows the pain of trying out new products\n\nCommon knowledge suggest services need to be 10x better because in order for users to really bother trying a new product it just needs to be a lot better. I think that's not the case and the key to solving this question lies in the phrase **\"to try a new product\".** \n\n**I believe the real reason are are the switching costs, lock-ins and network effects that make it very hard or impossible to leave services and try out something new.** \n\nImagine you wanted to move from Facebook to Google+, Akasha or Mastadon. All your posts and messages ported over is impossible and you immediately lose access to all of the friends you have on Facebook.\n\nSo as long as the following is true people tendenciously do not switch other services, even if they know those are better.\n\n    Costs to switch (time & mental effort) > Additional benefit offered * ~10\n\n## But....what about innovation?\n\nDon't these 10x requirements produce the leapfrogs in innovation we need to solve humanities biggest challenges quickly?\n\n![tenor|444x250](upload://oTgVgQCQJIebqk2D7N916FbTI5Q.gif) \n\n**Yes because** it indeed produces big, measurable, jumps in innovation that have brought humanity forward. \n\n**But no because** \n\n1. The amount of effort, money to build new (but structurally similar) services where 9/10 companies will fail because others dominating the market is a gigantic waste of human potential and time. We don't have the time to tinker on every new solution for years. We need to get it down to week(ends) or months.  ****\n2. Sometimes already a new feature to an existing service would bring great innovation. For example I waited 4 years before Facebook implemented the ability to save posts for later reading. Simply thing. If I had been able to modify this feature in my own clients it would have offered great workflow innovation for me.\n3. The necessity to have such big jumps also brought us insane growth requirements that are responsible for a lot of things that go wrong in this world in the first place, and which we need to fix now.\n\n## Faster innovation through incremental gains\n\n**How would a world look like where not 1/10 companies survive & produce 10x innovation, but 6/10 companies survive, each producing 2x innovation at 1/10 of the cost?** \n\nWe would enter a world where we create incremental innovations at higher speed and less effort, more employment, more stable companies and economy, more service competition and less exploitation. \n\n![com-optimize%20(2)|451x268](upload://lraYqtL2qVut74gWPrNffLeitCC.gif) \n\n## What's holding us back: Network Effects and Data Lock-Ins\n\n### Cause #1: How we share success in companies: \nSpeculative value increase\n\nIn order to reward the risk of contributing to a company in either time or money we use equity or stages stocks. \n\nThe problem is that in most cases shareholders make most (or all) of their profits if the speculative value of the company increases. The company's profits, revenue and user numbers are only proxies, success is not directly dependent on them. Growth is the key metric a company optimises for. \n\nTherefore the worst thing that can happen for shareholders is that growth is slow or negative. Losing users or revenue is not acceptable and lock-ins **must** be created. \n\nFacebook is arguably the king of network effects and also an example of how extreme the above dynamic has become:\n\n**In the 2nd quarter of 2018, Facebook lost $120bn (billion!) in stock value within 48 hours, the biggest loss of any company in history. The reason: It posted** the least growth **since its founding, while still making 5BN in profits the same quarter and growing by 42% since the last year.** \n\nThink whatever you want about they way Facebook makes money, but such a highly profitable company should not be losing 20% of their stock value overnight while still being wildly profitable. \n\n### Cause #2: You and your data are hostages:\nData and Social Lock-ins & Non-Interoperable data formats\n\nThe requirement to grow incentivises companies to lock people into their services and make it very hard to leave. Either it's difficult to migrate and reuse your data in other services, or they create network effects where you lose your social connections if you leave a service. \n\n[https://twitter.com/piamancini/status/1045034032407425024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/piamancini/status/1045034032407425024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThis also creates counter incentives for interoperable formats which would make it easier to migrate between services or integrate them into custom workflows. \n\nFurther, most businesses require to amass intellectual property in the form of proprietary software. There is an economic incentive to **not** share their progress with the world. \nThis way every new service/competitor needs to start freshly, even for a simple app like a calendar app. \n\n# The 3 things that need to change\n\nBreaking this dynamic requires tackling the problem from multiple angles. \nI think it needs 3 things to make that possible.  \n\n1. **Data and social Interoperability** so users can freely move between services that suit their needs better and never lose the ability to communicate with their friends on other services. This will create the free-market pressure to produce good services, as you can't lock people in as easily anymore and only keep them if you are the best service to them.\n2. **Economic models that reward being a good service, not growth.**\nIn an environment where people can easily leave a service, a company can only really be successful if they focus on being a good service. This way they will need to optimise for revenue, not growth. Further, their growth is limited to the amount of people they can be the best service for, so it will be hard to get growth-focused Venture Capital investments. Another economic model is needed where investors make money only if the company is being a good service, thus by making revenue and profits.\n3. **Optional but ideal: Open-Source software** \nNew companies should be able to build on each other's work to provide services faster without spending 1000s of hours in building up services from scratch. Increased collaboration on key infrastructure and drop in development costs are expected.\n\n## A way forward?\n\nAt [WorldBrain.io](http://worldbrain.io) we are building open-source software and attempt to enable incremental innovation in the (knowledge management) software space. \n\nThe foundation to make this possible is Memex, an open-source privacy focused tool to organise your online research. It's a mix of a Google Search for everything you have seen in the past, Medium's highlighting and commenting features but for the whole web, and Pocket's organisation features supercharged. All data is stored locally on your computer by default - you are in control. (You can download it here: [worldbrain.io](http://worldbrain.io))\n\nThis is how it help may tackle the problem: \n\n1. **We bake interoperability deep into the core of Memex.**\nTo make search possible Memex stores personal data from the different services you use (e.g. your browsing history/bookmarks/trails, social media posts and comments, what you shared/liked content on social media, your annotations and notes). \nDoing so in a way that creates unified data formats across multiple services. After all, social media posts on Twitter and Facebook are structurally not that different. \nTo make this data usable for you we are in the process of developing an API that you, developers and entrepreneurs can use to innovate on new services or integrate with your existing ones. This central data store also houses your own social graph, so whichever service you eventually use, you can take your friends with you. \n2. **Everything we develop is open source.** \nEveryone has different workflows when managing knowledge and needs different tools. People can copy Memex, change features and reuse the data they had in their previous Memex via the Storex API, or use 2 Memex tools in parallel. This ensures that innovators do not have to start freshly every time they want to improve a service, but can create incremental gains, acquire users easily and eventually create innovation faster. \n3. **[WorldBrain.io](http://worldbrain.io) has no stock value. There is no speculation.**\nTo reward early contributions and risk, we use a non-speculative economic model called Steward Ownership. In practice it is a profit sharing model that has a cap on the returns investors and employees can make - the cap is higher the earlier you join. \nThis ensures that everyone is focused on building a sustainable service and greed for more than you ought to get is removed. \n**It allows us as a company to be OK (its surely nothing to celebrate, but its OK) to lose users and revenue to other services as it will only delay investors' returns, not lower them.** \n\n## Next Steps:\n\nOf course such a data infrastructure, and the resulting data sovereignty, brings a whole new class of (privacy) challenges with it - after all we wanna prevent that this can turn into a Cambridge Analytica 4.0 scenario because people unknowingly share detailed data about their digital life. \n\nWe are currently forming a community of people to map out all those challenges and how to tackle them through e.g. good UX, education or privacy preserving technologies.\n\n### Our open questions we want to address:\n\n1. How do we create a secure technology infrastructure for personal data?\n2. Data sovereignty & flexible APIs come with risks - Cambridge Analytica 4.0 style risks. How do we create good UX that makes it easy, transparent and flexible to share personal data with other applications, while educating users about the potential risks and opportunities.\n3. What can we learn from past efforts to interoperability and data model standardisation in order to create interoperable data models/formats for knowledge sharing that can evolve with contemporary needs.\n4. How does legislation need to change to support ecosystems that are built on privacy as well as data portability/interoperability and reduce social lock-ins?\n5. How can (governmental) funding mechanisms be designed to support early stage entrepreneurs and organisations using Steward Ownership or Non-Profit models, so they can avoid Venture Capital and focus on generating sustainable revenue/profits.\n6. How can we facilitate a multi-stakeholder community of individuals & organisations with potentially large spectrum of political, economical and technical motivations/requirements to use this data infrastructure. \n7. How can we create a community that is inclusive to people with different, sometimes opposing, world views and which lives constructive, consent-focused (not consensus!) discourse to ease those difference and find multi-partisan solutions.\n\n**Do you have ideas on how to answer those questions, or know people who do?** \n\n**Get in touch with us and help designing systems that are user centric, interoperable and build with a strong focus on data sovereignty and privacy.**\n\nJoin us in our Slack/telegram Channel (coming soon)", "created_at": "2019-06-24 18:56:18.027552", "updated_at": "2020-12-13 08:34:55.727074", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1971, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 977.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 5, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40820, "user_id": 3782, "topic_id": 7913, "post_number": 9, "raw": "[text-direction=rtl]\n\n\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0646\u0641\u0643\u0631 \u0633\u0648\u0627\n[/text-direction]", "created_at": "2017-12-30 12:23:40.996632", "updated_at": "2017-12-31 11:42:58.495432", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 28.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [40814], "is_liked_by": [4041], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40982, "user_id": 4041, "topic_id": 7913, "post_number": 11, "raw": "[text-direction=rtl]\n\u0647\u062f\u064a\u0631.. \u0623\u0633\u0641\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u0627\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062f \u0628\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0638\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0633\u0641\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a\n\u064a\u0627 \u0631\u064a\u062a.. \u062c\u0627\u0647\u0632\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u064a \u0648\u0642\u062a \u0628\u0625\u0630\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\n\n[/text-direction]", "created_at": "2018-01-05 10:38:59.663243", "updated_at": "2018-01-05 10:38:59.663243", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 24, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 23.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [40820], "is_liked_by": [3782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40762, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 7914, "post_number": 1, "raw": "This is for @alberto @amelia @jason_vallet   \n\nI am still working in order to lay down useful statistics to compare filtering methods, in the meanwhile, you may want to visually inspect the data.\n\nI would love to have feedback on the usable size of networks: unto how many nodes and edges are these graphs still readable and usable to investigate the data?

My name is Hugi, I'm fairly new in the community.\n\nOriginally from Iceland, but I've spent most of my life in Stockholm, Sweden.\nI'm currently working with @nadia and @alberto on Recode, but have been following news on the house in Morocco and will be visiting there in a couple of weeks.\n\nMy life is split between a few different areas:\n\n1) A lot of my time recently has gone towards organising participatory culture spaces and events in Scandinavia. Specifically, I'm on the board of the community space [the Node in Stockholm](http://syntheistnode.se/), on the board of the [Borderland event](http://theborderland.se/).\n\n2) I freelance as a software developer, mainly working web dev, but I've also worked in analytics and with databases. I'm also involved in a few open-source software projects related to participatory culture and organisations. They are aptly named [Dreams](https://github.com/Metaburn/dreams) and [Realities](http://github.com/theborderland/realities). \n\n3) Sometimes, I also do work in organisational consulting or with setting up structures for co-creative processes and events. Some of this is art related, which is a field I love working in.\n\n4) Sometimes I get caught up in politics. In 2006, I was one of the founding members of the Swedish Pirate Party, and was the first chairman of its youth organisation, but I've not been directly involved with the Swedish pirates since 2008, though I keep in touch with them.  In 2016 I was one of four election campaign managers for the Icelandic Pirate Party. In 2017, there were elections again, and I went back for a month then too. I've also been involved in the [Alter Ego network](http://alterego.network/). Occasionally, [I write about politics](http://piratetimes.net/no-bright-future-a-cautionary-tale/). \n\n5) Recently, many of my interests (analytics, politics, participatory) have converged in working on getting Edgeryders Recode off the ground.\n\n6) My educational background is in biotechnology/bioinformatics engineering. \n\nI'm happy to have joined such an awesome network!

It looks like Woodbine are doing some great work on this.\n\nAttitudes towards alternative medicine are a case in point - not only is there resistance from the medical institutions [often ignoring solid evidence supporting the practice], but ordinary people pick up on that and are averse to being involved with something that doesn't have the approval of the medical 'authorities'.\n\nI wonder if the Woodbine folk have encountered any resistance to 'woo' things like TCM and Feldenkrais, and if so, how they have overcome this?\n\nI should also put in a shout for the Chinese tradition of Yang Sheng - non-industrialised health practices that aren't just about physical fitness, and that can be suitable for those recuperating or without full physical mobility.\n\nIf you have a community library, Peter Deadman's <a href=\"https://peterdeadman.co.uk/live-well-live-long/\">latest</a> might make a great addition - not only does it cover a whole range of areas [general health, pregnancy, ageing, etc] but it cites lots of western science to back up the older eastern practices.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-18 16:14:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.336082", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 241, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 2.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2569], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80643, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 10851, "post_number": 14, "raw": "It\u2019s mixed footage - outside parts are recent, indoor parts are mixed - footage from the shared lunch in the house is pre-covid, as well as the nightclub footage.

In a file system for example, these are folders, files, and the various ways to structure files (which depend on file type). In a Git repository for source code, these are in addition branches, forks and tags. In almost cases, these mechanisms form a hierarchical data structure: text is structured inside files, files inside folders. This means, the mechanisms differ by granularity. Now the general principle to sort in a new piece information is to use the most granular (most \u201clow level\u201d) mechanism that is suitable for the task. Because this keeps the information as close to its most related information as possible, which in turn makes it well findable because collaborators will look first into places \u201cwhere similar stuff is found\u201d. Keeping related information close together in this way is here called \u201chigh cohesion\u201d. Note that this is a rough rule of thumb with many exceptions, but still a useful guideline.\n\nHere is an example to flesh this out: Let\u2019s say you created an expense registration spreadsheet for a new project and want to place it somewhere in a shared file repository like Google Drive. The most fine-grained mechanism to structure data in this repository that you have available is \u201cinside the files\u201d. The rule says you should consider that first to place your spreadsheet somewhere \u2013 which would lead you to consider putting it into a new sheet (\u201ctab\u201d) in an existing budget spreadsheet file of that project. If that is not suitable for some reason, then the next more granular mechanism is the level of files: you could place it as a new spreadsheet file into the same directory as the budget spreadsheet, with the filename indicating its relation to the budget spreadsheet. By letting both filenames start with the same prefixes, you keep them close together when a user looks at the containing folder\u2019s file list. \u201cClose together\u201d means more cohesion, and more cohesion means better findability. The two filesnames could be for example `Finances:_Budget` and `Finances:_Expense_Registry` .\n[/quote]\n\nwhat do you think about template project folders? It would be useful to establish a coherent structure in  an organisation, but when I go experience I have seldom seen carefully created structures properly used, since most of the time people do not take the time to understand the structures someone has already set up and instead set up their own, or just save and share without structure.

Auto-correct reading mode\n\nUnderstanding communication is mental work. Even with all the best practices collected in this manual, it will remain an effort, in part because communication will always be imperfect: people will be tired, make spelling mistakes, have and express unclear thoughts, forget to include links, apply messy formatting and so on.\n\nHere, active reading with a kind of mental auto-correct mode helps to reduce the delays of back-and-forth communication. For example: instead of asking back what an unclear sentence means and waiting two hours for the answer, two minutes of going through the paragraph in detail and trying to find and follow its internal logic may already solve the mystery.\n\nWhen this is about written communication within a whole group, such as in an online forum, it makes sense to then just edit the original author\u2019s contribution by fixing the mistakes. Even just fixing spelling mistakes or messy formatting or adding missing links will reduce the work of understanding of everyone who has to read this afterwards. In our organization, we practice this informally to various degrees in [our Discourse forum](https://edgeryders.eu/), supported by automatic edit notifications. This way, the original author can catch the rare case of disimprovement edits \u2013 where the edit does not express what they wanted to say.\n[/quote]\n\nHere I would like to add that when having written communication we should also be aware that it is estimated that between 5-10% of the population has dyslexia, but this number can also be as high as 17% and in certain professions, such as design for example can be even higher (My University paid for students tests and measured up to 30% in some courses). With this knowledge we should also stress that misspelled words are not to be understood as a lack of caring or lazyness of not using a correction tool. For people with some form of dyslexia it could be very time-consuming or even impossible to make sure to get all words right.", "created_at": "2019-12-09 16:01:28.576296", "updated_at": "2019-12-09 16:01:28.576296", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 347, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 40.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [62302], "is_reply_to": [62302], "is_liked_by": [5698, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87779, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 14991, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2020-11-29 10:36:08.620313", "updated_at": "2020-11-29 10:36:08.620313", "deleted_at": "2020-11-29 10:36:27.146609", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41832, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8083, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Calling @matteo_uguzzoni and @anique.yael.

It could be a nice to see their development ( Rise and fall ) and learn how to spread in a decentralized way, also how to start a library with members that are active and open to the outer community coordinating talks with thinkers/ authors in different spaces in the country.\n\nhope you find this useful, and I think for sure you will be in the coming Camp , am I right ?", "created_at": "2017-12-02 11:47:48.871571", "updated_at": "2017-12-02 11:47:48.871571", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 388, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 9.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51524, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9586, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n![virtual%20caf%C3%A9%20all|690x262](upload://3ebE5G7DXpDXwyTGFUlNDknCoFp.png) \n\nWelcome and sign up for a virtual cafes!

Many attended our Social Innovation Camp, most in their early twenties and some much younger (@AnesB is 16!). \n\nWhat does it mean to be active in Medenine? Most of those I met are volunteering with established organisations: peacebuilding corps, Junior Chamber International (JCI), European Voluntary Service (EVS) exchanges, and others which channel funds from the British embassy and from American donors. Someone explained it to us with wit: \u201cwe don\u2019t have leisure opportunities in town, so we need to spend our time being active in other things\u201d (@Elyes). It emerged in the group discussions I have been part of that aside from the active youth volunteers, there is a hunger for local entrepreneurship. Everyone agreed that Medenine needs more entrepreneurs to change the local landscape, but beyond info sessions, university lectures which people are involved in organising or participate in i.e. in Tunis, nothing really comes back to Medenine, by young entrepreneurs who would stay in town. \n\nWhat I was expecting, but didn\u2019t quite hear it, is that someone in the group is seriously turning their experience of contributing to society into a personal project, that volunteering is not a substitute for leisure or extracurriculars, but a long term personal mission, the object of sustainable work. Somehow I missed it, even though everyone agrees on a \u201cneed of opportunities\u201d. Yosser\u2019s determination with Our Ghema being the exception here. \n\nThis, for me, is the crux of this emerging community to provide value for its members. **Can we, now all being edgeryders, create an opportunity to become the scenario for a rewarding working life? Not just another fun, learning activity, but more like a formal organisation connected to the network.**\n\nMany prerequisites for action are there already! It starts from everyone\u2019s strong attachment to the town and the Tunisian South of which Medenine is part of. Many go outside Medenine to study but are keen on coming back (during the Camp most people were on the winter break). Aspirationally, we are checking the right box: people are keen on making a difference - changing mentality and inefficient communication loops. No wonder @anique.yael told us repeatedly: \u201cthe knowledge is in you\u201d. \n\nOne thing missing, we found, is exposure to models, examples of *how* exactly others do it right - like Anis Saada, who was the more experienced in the group, a teacher and ecosystem pioneer himself who just opened the first co-working space in town. Bringing in more mentors seems like an affordable cost which Yosser\u2019s group can take on as part of steady community building to continue the process just started. Which brings me to my last point: there is leadership. This young woman and her crowd are the most stubbornly passionate people I\u2019ve seen in a while! I felt deeply inspired, yet with @matthias  we felt having been part of this before, in Nepal, Romania, Armenia: fragile communities with potential.. if only we had more time together, if only we could keep joined efforts for longer. Collaboration needs time.\n\nThis means that with @Yosser and @Zmorda, and whoever wants to keep going, we get back in the drawing room and  make concrete a few next steps. Edgeryders - through our vision of OpenVillage houses - can assist as a fully committed partner. Since no one has a project they already know they want to do, the question would be: what is a service that the community and the space (say, Our Ghema - the obvious outlet by now), can provide? \nIs it a communication product of @Nidhal  & co? Can @Salem seed more social businesses like the ones he helped create through his volunteering? Is it a community crypto-currency that @Sohayeb is looking into? A training service by @Elyes? Is it an add-on to co-working spaces, since everyone seems to see the need?\n\nAn encouraging example of connecting the dots: it took a few conversations with @Dorsaf about how she, a bioengineer, wishes to do creative work outside the closed realms of academic work, in a place where she can experiment with her passion for genes and teach (seed planted by Anique, well done!). Hopefully she can come and spend time at the Reef in Brussels to get inspiration and start a local biohacking movement. @WinniePoncelet and his team are starting to make a living out of biohacking, surely something to share. \n\nOn a personal level, I find the diversity we\u2019ve seen in the camp reassuring - from gender balance to the background and capabilities of everyone: business students, caretakers, personal development trainers, engineers, electronic graduates.

Rather it is **a new framework and mindset** that can help different teams and organisations successfully navigate current and future challenges.\n\nThe conversation is continuing in our online community forum right now.

Once we have done that successfully, we believe there is no limit to how far we can go.

The idea was that the \"Booked Scheduler\" software (recommended above) would be used as it is to book a guestroom or other accommodation in a commune. PayCoupons would be used to \"pay\" for that with the commune's coupons \u2013 the benefit of that is that Booked Scheduler does not need any payment system integration to make that work. Renting out the same room via AirBnB can be done in parallel.\n\nHowever, the reason PayCoupons is not the right tool for short-term \"moneyless\" room renting or other spontaneous purchases is: you have to wait for PayCoupons network barter transactions to happen. This conflicts with wanting to book the room \"right now\".\n\nThere are two possible workarounds for this:\n\n* Saving up in PayCoupons before needing the room. But, visiting cities is a rare and unplannable activity so it would only make sense if you can use the same coupons in a network of at least 30, better 100 cities across a region like Europe. The Reef network may provide that eventually, but certainly not right now.\n\n* Paying in own coupons rather than coupons of the space. This is always possible, as everyone can create own coupons as much as they like. It is however not the idea in PayCoupons, because it places too much of the risk on the seller: the space-operating organization will not know whether they are ever able to utilize these coupons (by redeeming or exchanging them). One might argue that unused rooms are excess capacity, so it does not hurt to sell it for unredeemable coupons. That is true when introducing a rule that those paying in money or coupons of the house have priority access (cancelling other bookings until 24 hours before the stay). Such a rule is allowed within the PayCoupons economic system, so why not.\n\nThat second proposal may work in our case, but it's certainly not an economically attractive option for general use, and thus not an attractive option for introducing PayCoupons to mass adoption. Even for ourselves, it may not feel right to make hosting Edgeryders community members a transactional relation \u2013 only when we have so many guest rooms that all kinds of people stay there, it would feel appropriate. For the moment, I'll put the idea at rest.\n\nThat said, Booked Scheduler is still a good reservation system for a commune's spare capacity of rooms.", "created_at": "2017-08-11 22:58:10.830617", "updated_at": "2019-02-13 13:46:02.491554", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 425, "wiki": false, "reads": 33, "score": 416.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39960, "user_id": 3703, "topic_id": 7600, "post_number": 5, "raw": "@Asma", "created_at": "2017-12-04 10:52:03.367864", "updated_at": "2017-12-04 10:52:03.367864", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 7.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39961, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 7764, "post_number": 14, "raw": "For reference, [the Github issue](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/118) that Alberto created to solve the null-code annotations (and prevent them in the future) is now fixed.", "created_at": "2017-12-04 11:01:50.433560", "updated_at": "2017-12-04 11:01:50.433560", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 30, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 51.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [39892], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40956, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 7938, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2018-01-04 15:54:43.854858", "updated_at": "2018-01-07 10:26:19.571056", "deleted_at": "2018-05-21 12:01:53.203656", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41026, "user_id": 4088, "topic_id": 7939, "post_number": 3, "raw": "i'm so interested !!! @nadia , in our first meeting in Medenine, she introduced to us what's meant by ethnography and it seems very usefull to me, especially the innovative way how to provide social informations by networking !! good job guys", "created_at": "2018-01-06 23:19:39.142414", "updated_at": "2018-01-06 23:19:39.142414", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 41, "wiki": false, "reads": 24, "score": 144.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323, 3, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41063, "user_id": 3711, "topic_id": 7941, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Indeed, it seems there is so much in common!

He does it in Belgium for extremely rich people lately. He is working events for 70-1100 people. No masks, no distances, no corona measures whatsoever. It is happening right now while they are introducing new bans. This week he is busy from Wednesday to Sunday.\nWhat are the measures for the rest of the population in Belgium again? I should stop here as this is already food enough for thought but...\n\nYour basic premise seems to be built on information we are being served by mainstream media. As long as that's your premise, we cannot really discuss the measures taken. Not because you are wrong and I am right. It is simply because we start with a very different premise so we have fundamentally different perception on the things. I know it is possible I am quite wrong about everything, but I believe I have more information than you do, coming from very different sources. So unless you are willing to take a good look at that, we cannot really reach understanding. When I see a phrase like \n\n[quote=\"noemi, post:7, topic:14462\"]\nI believe it is very complex and of course it will depend on the type of state you are and how \u2018ruly\u2019 or \u2018unruly\u2019 the population is\u2026\n[/quote]\nit gives me the creeps. The way my brain filtered it is: \"the situation is too complex for us mortals to understand, so we should let the state take care of it...and if it looks like they are being rough on us, it's because we cannot understand anything better, it's just tough love and they have our best interest in mind\". I know that's not exactly what you meant but, I said that's how my brain filtered it :slight_smile: .  \n\nYes. I am talking about restriction of movement, of seeing other people, soon to be obligatory vaccine for everyone. They are again creating conditions detrimental for human health, both mental and physical. It will lead to a desparate situation where people will accept so happily any vaccines they give in order to improve their life. In fact, vaccine will not be mandatory but they will make our life pretty much impossible without it...so yeah we will have the \"freedom of choice\".\n\nNow I see articles with titles like \"covid all but exterminated flu\" and similar bullshit...come on. The crap they are feeding us is just insulting. They have to do it though because, no matter how much you censure the information, the truth will come out. Especially something as simple as just going through the total number of deaths this year, comparing to deaths previous years. Then comparing the numbers of covid cases, combining with flu cases and comparing with previous years. When you consider the average age of covid deaths, you can see how ridiculous this whole thing is.\n\nWhat about this https://altcensored.com/watch?v=cQ-PGjyxCVw\n**And why is that video censured on youtube?** It is a common practice in every country...\nAre you aware of big financial incentives to declare more Covid cases? \nHow about this: https://altcensored.com/watch?v=fSPeuyOawMQ , average age is 80.\n**Why is it banned on youtube? Why are so many people banned/censured on facebook too?**\nWhy are even google searches meddled with? I tested them after a video talking about how all info against corona mainstream narrative is buried under all kinds of pages debunking it and that is a fact...\n\nAnd no, I am not saying old people should die. I am saying a lot of them are dying of other things and covid is just added to the list and included in statistics. There are plenty of cases for that and testimonies by doctors as well. Did you see the new numbers released by CDC???\nHighest death toll is for 70+ age and it is 0.05%.\n\nI am not saying corona virus doesn't exist. I am saying it is used to justify catastrophic social engineering experiments and economic reset which is coming. Which I knew will come 5 years ago already by the way, so did several of my friends...or we missed by a year.\n\nI am also saying things have been blown out of proportion and for reasons I can't fully understand. The reason is certainly not covid19 threat to our civilisation. We deal with things worse than that every day...\nMy whole point is this: \nThere are far deadlier things than covid and we never mobilised or locked down the world to deal with them. Psychopaths we have as heads of states or the ultra powerful couldn't care less for loss of human life, but now suddenly they will lock down whole countries to save lives? **That's a big red flag for me.** Every day around the world we see proof of their care for human life.  Over the last 1000 years, every bit of freedom won was through struggle and in spite of the ruling class. They are as disconnected from general population or real life as royalty was in middle ages...\nDo you know that women giving birth in French hospitals were obliged to wear masks DURING CHILDBIRTH? Sounds like a humane measure?\n\nYou don't find it strange that so many very reputable and successful academics in the relevant fields risk everything and go publicly against the mainstream narrative?\n\nHow about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X21UboS93qc&ab_channel=GlobalMedia\nor this https://altcensored.com/watch?v=otRN0X6F81c\n\nFunny how Lancet publishes 2 researches claiming hydroxychloroquine is not effective against covid 19 AND it actually increases the death % and all media publish that. A bit later Lancet **retracts** the research as it did not pass the peer review and **very few media publish that fact**. \nHere is the link example https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6/fulltext\n\nDo you believe a nobel prize winner for his work on HIV is talking nonsense when he says that covid19 was artificially modified? I mean, he is only a virologist with many awards, national and international and with 50+ years of experience in the field... again now, I am looking for his video on youtube and no way to find it. By youtube algorithms it is supposed to be at the very top but I see some obscure people \"debunking\" his claims with low view counts. It shows how far the tech dictatorship and control goes.\nOk I found it under a non English title finally... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdj4hRvJ3vA&t=34s&ab_channel=FESTV\nHe was of course contradicted by Dr. R. Sebbag, a virologist with a career in business, notably one of the most profitable ones (vaccines).\nHere is something about vaccines...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5pj1eb8JXA&ab_channel=ludovicserrano\n\nDo you believe Dr. Didier Raoult is a charlatan too? He also only has decades of experience as a microbiologist specialised in infectious deseases. He is one of the most influential microbiologists in the world and has revolutionised the field...and now they treat him as a charlatan just because he did not agree with the mainstream covid 19 nonsense narrative.\n\nWe have 5000 tests per day in Croatia now, compared to 5000 per month in August or July.\n\nIn Belgium we had 3 times more tests done per day since September compared to July and August. If you consider that PCR test basically is extremely unreliable, it is only normal we have raise in cases.\n\nSame is with double counting. That was even in mainstream media, if a person tested twice and both times was positive, they counted that in final statistics.\n\nLet's just forget all that \"conspiracy talk\" and use plain logic: there are many corona viruses, how did we battle them? What were the solutions far? Have we ever locked down healthy population?\n\nIf this one is so different, why is that the case? I go back to man made manipulation but it could be my mistake totally.\n\nI had Covid in family and friends too, so did my partner. Combined we know more than 20 people who were diagnosed. There was 1 extreme case with a lot of pain and lengthy recovery, one with long lasting effect of no taste or smell. The rest were no symptoms or equal to mild flu...", "created_at": "2020-10-14 16:41:35.882169", "updated_at": "2020-10-14 16:41:35.882169", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1442, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 18.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [84793], "is_reply_to": [84793], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29755, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 3033, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Hey Nadia,\n\nIf this is about Arpine Galfayan, she speaks English perfectly.

However, after sometime this strong community faded away and the opposite start that we turned to belong to smaller groups until reaching to belong to yourself only. In my case and I think with many Egyptian lived it the same way we kept searching for this feeling of a diverse connected community that is hard to reach.

We all take good notes and share them with the organisers.\n\nOnline discussions: Virtual discussions on our online community forums. This is where participants reconnect after the physical gatherings to reconnect and meet others in the community, access the documentation, online courses, more events, job opportunities etc.\n\nLiving  handbook: Our platform functions as a kind of expertise directory where participants share their personal and professional experiences around the topics and issues of new internet technologies (incl. AI), Justice  or Wellbeing of individuals and communities. Our community journalists help participants to transform their contribution to the online conversation into editorialised content that we then use to build a larger audience for their ideas, connect them around common themes and potential collaborations etc. \n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\"> Questions that were touched on in the workshop </h2>\n\n1. **The EU\u2019s new Commission is looking to approve a new AI directive, and of course democratic participation is important to ensure a good law.

But for some reason, we don\u2019t have the same idea about data, and why not?\n7. **What are the reasons people are unable to act upon algorithmic issues in society?**\n8. **Where is the space in which humans can have agency?**\n\n\n-----\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\"> The Workshop Discussions </h2>\n\n-----\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\">1. The EU\u2019s new Commission is looking to approve a new AI directive, and of course democratic participation is important to ensure a good law. What do you feel necessary from EU to participate? </h3>\n\n---\n\n* Human centered internet is not defined, that\u2019s why you can\u2019t find a solution. \u201cHuman\u201d is literally anyone.\n\n* Why are we pushing for AI? The end of Moore\u2019s law. The money we seek in are more unlike to come back. Industry took a risk at specialised chips: AI and blockchain-specific. So, now they need to create a demand for these chips. We should be aware of the vendor-driven nature of this stuff, and think about how to regulate these companies.\n\n* The business model of Big Tech now is based on keeping the code, providing cloud services and collecting data to profile and ultimately influence users. They cross-subsidize their cloud services with their marketing revenue streams. If you want to fight that, you should have public cloud infrastructure, which is a trillion-EUR affair. That\u2019s your investment in human-centric AI infrastructure.\n\n* Companies like Google optimise with AI the profilazione of their customers. The difference is if it\u2019s a data centered AI or not. \u2026 ? Where do we bring the democratic process into new models?\n\n* Are we really at the end of Moore's Law? This is a claim that is not uncontested\n\n* In Belgium there is a company called It\u2019sMe, who does online identity. They are pushing their data onto Azure, making it GDPR and EIDAS compliant. That changed my thinking, because it showed me as even these sterling silver pieces of European thinking ends up in the Silicon Valley cloud.\n* We need to break the number-person relationship: when you get born, you receive a number from the state, and the game\u2019s up. I dream of disposable identities, that we set up with the purpose of entering into a relationship, like for example receiving a service. A good analogy is one-time email addresses: you get an email address, you sign up to some online service with it, use it ONCE to receive the email to confirm you do control that email, and then it self destructs.\n\n* I\u2019m a bit skeptical that legislation is the right instrument to do this kind of things. It\u2019s a blunt instrument, because as of now there is no good understanding of the process from the ethical values (fairly easy to encode in a directive) to the actual technical choices of the scientists and engineers building AI systems. Ex. we like the New Zealand group developing Scuttlebutt: when users asked for cross-device accounts, the core developer replied \u201cI\u2019m not doing that, because we want to serve underprivileged people, and these people do not have multiple devices\u201d. What he was doing was justifying his technical choices in terms of his values. As a socio-technical culture, we are not good at that.\n\n\n---\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> 2. What is \u201cinvestment in AI\u201d? What should the EU do practically?</h3>\n\n----\n* climate + competition policy = nobody is allowed to grow to much. What is \u201cempowering\u201d? I suspect that AI (ML applied on big data) is inherently NOT human-centric, because its models (for example a recommendation algo) encode each human into a database, and then models you in terms of who you are similar to: for example, a woman between 35 and 45 who speaks Dutch and watches stand-up comedy on Netflix. Everything not standardizable, everything that makes you you, gets pushed to the error term of the model. That is hardly human-centric, because it leads to optimizing systems in terms of abstract \u201ctypical humans\u201d or \u201ctarget groups\u201d or whatever.\n\n* The business model of Big Tech now is based on keeping the code, providing cloud services and collecting data to profile and ultimately influence users. They cross-subsidize their cloud services with their marketing revenue streams. If you want to fight that, you should have public cloud infrastructure, which is a trillion-EUR affair. That\u2019s your investment in human-centric AI infrastructure.\n\n* Companies like Google optimise with AI the profilazione of their customers. The difference is if it\u2019s a data centered AI or not. \u2026 ? Where do we bring the democratic process into new models?\n\n* Governance instead of government. Here\u2019s my take: the kind of society you are looking at is anarcho-communist. The communist part is that infrastructure is fully centralized, like in the 30 glorieuse. Anything that runs onto the infrastructure is fully permissionless. That\u2019s the anarchist part. And finally, the data stays with the people.\n\n* I agree with the antitrust principle. What we consider AI is machine learning, this is the root of our problems, it\u2019s just classical statistics. You create the illusion that value production is shifted to the generation\u2026. ex. if the doctor establish a relation with the patient, the AI has not to invade the relation, but now the doctor has to take notes and patient see less value in it (you look somewhere else and you are centralised\u2026).\n\n* Airport before and after Ryanair: before architecture were associated to functions and your experience of travels, room for different functions. Now with the low cost you consider that the experience is less valuable, now is a shopping mall and at the gate it\u2019s temporarily informations about space.\n\n* medicine is not diagnosis, but prognosis-based. In medicine, nothing has value if I cannot improve your life. A patient can and should negotiate with the doctor where to go from here; he or she even has a right to die. This is a very poor fit for how ML-on-big-data works.\n\n----\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> 3. Can we think of counterproductive regulation on the Internet? Stuff like the copyright directive? how did we end up with all these things, that used to be a public good, end up being someone\u2019s property?</h3>\n\n----\n\n* internet changes the ratio of power. We behave like we are in the pre-internet era, because internet is a new technology and it takes longer for us to change behaviours.\n\n* Airport before and after Ryanair: before architecture were associated to functions and your experience of travels, room for different functions. Now with the low cost you consider that the experience is less valuable, now is a shopping mall and at the gate it\u2019s temporarily informations about space.\n\n* in Helsinki everybody agreed that you can\u2019t sell your data.\n\n* We optimize relationships. This is problematic. For example, we have marketing companies working with civil liberties organizations, that tell their clients: we can tell you which of your donors care about which issues, so you can optimize for issues where you get more money.\n\n* Optimisation has been the logic as far, but it can go wrong anyway. Traffic is a perfect example. If you look at optimization system, it comes at a cost and if you don\u2019t do internalise the cost it causes bigger damages. Apparently innocent choices as what to optimize for turn out to have huge consequences. When you design traffic, do you optimize for driver safety? Or for pedestrian safety? Of minimize time spent on the road?\n\n*  on feedbacks: I know GDPR, it\u2019s regulated anyway. There are serious problems on how GDPR focuses on personal data on individuals.\n* We talk about automated decisions, but there is a set of criteria \u2026 the optimization is not about the single person, but as pbe part of a certain group which operates certain choices in general. So, you expect to empower people, but actually you don\u2019t. Paul Olivier Dehaye is trying to pool data from different workers to see if people are being discriminated. This is called a \u201cdata trust\u201d. There is also the DECODE project that is doing something they called \u201cdata commons\u201d.\n\n* We are now in a mess with the GDPR. Uber, for example, uses it to refuse to give drivers their data, saying this impacts the rights of the riders. This (says Seda) is the consequence of focusing on personal rights when the data are used to optimize over populations.\n\n----\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> 4. Do we actually need AI? Why are we pushing for AI? </h3>\n\n____\n\n* I just read a review of 37,000 studies of AI in medicine. Of these, only about 100 had enough information on training datasets to do a meta-analysis on. Of these, 24 claimed prospective design (the algorithm had been trained without knowing the real data); of these zero had actually done prospective design.\n* \u2026 I don\u2019t know any real medical problem that prospective AI model can solve.\n\n* medicine is not diagnosis, but prognosis-based. In medicine, nothing has value if I cannot improve your life. A patient can and should negotiate with the doctor where to go from here; he or she even has a right to die. This is a very poor fit for how ML-on-big-data works.\n* Why are we pushing for AI? The end of Moore\u2019s law. The money we seek in are more unlike to come back. Industry took a risk at specialised chips: AI and blockchain-specific. So, now they need to create a demand for these chips. We should be aware of the vendor-driven nature of this stuff, and think about how to regulate these companies.\n\n* The business model of Big Tech now is based on keeping the code, providing cloud services and collecting data to profile and ultimately influence users. They cross-subsidize their cloud services with their marketing revenue streams. If you want to fight that, you should have public cloud infrastructure, which is a trillion-EUR affair. That\u2019s your investment in human-centric AI infrastructure.\n\n* Companies like Google optimise with AI the profilazione of their customers. The difference is if it\u2019s a data centered AI or not. \u2026 ? Where do we bring the democratic process into new models?\n\n----\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> 5. Where do we bring the democratic process into new models? </h3>\n\n------\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\">6.  If we want to shape the common sense five or ten years from now what will be considered relevant? What will general principles about what we consider good or bad look like or work in practice?</h3>\n\n___\n\n* I want to clearly distinguish between systems of exploitation and the technology itself. Any system of exploitation, including capitalism, will find and use  *any*  new technological option in exploitative ways. The history of digital innovation and media innovation in more general is quite rich in that: before AI for behavior prediction it has been targeted advertising, tracking, mass surveillance programs by governments, weaponized drones, propaganda micro-targeting, mass media use for state propaganda etc\u2026\n\n* That\u2019s purely a social problem, not a technological one. Adding one more technology cannot make it much worse \u2026 nukes are already around, so what technology could offer significantly worse potential outcomes? So to deal with it, you don\u2019t have to make legislation for AI, but against capitalism.\n\n* AI in itself is a nice tool in the toolkit, and easily allows for beneficial use. Personal example: my [open source coffee sorter ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/7122) project uses deep learning based image classifiers to relieve small-scale farmers from sorting your coffee by hand.\n\n* Technology leads to bad or good results: Principle of social justice\n\n* Amartya Sen\u2019s principle of substantial freedom, a sustainable substantial freedom. We need to have capacity/capability to live the life we want\n\n* As worker, I want it to help me to avoid discrimination in subjective interviews, but not to be used to have AI discriminating against me because of previous behavior of \u201cmy\u201d group\n\n* My freedom should be enhanced\n\n* Putting on the table simple methodology that allows us to understand the just and the unjust\n\n* This kind of principle is not the one we take out, it\u2019s a methodology, an open-ended principle - it can be filled with content, case by case only through the participatory mechanism.\n\n* Different subjective values of different contexts can lead to conflict- case by case through participatory processes is the solution - not just regulation\n\n* We slowly develop what we consider to be just\n\n* People become the owners and agents over their own data. The Great Hack. Fair use, data economy. An ethical data operations on a global scale, with a decentralized system, fair european data economy, we\u2019re currently colonized - europe only has 3% market share\n\n* Data economy there are 4 models: Lanlard: you\u2019re money is worth up to 20.000 euros (??). Three other models, like in barcelona, NGI calls it decode. They consider data to be common good of a city or community. There are 4 different types of these data economy model\n\n* Mymobility, own your data. People are not really aware that they can manage their own data. Energy and transportation has the east sensitive data.\n\n* Inform the civil society and create new business model\n\n* I look at automation and documentation at violence registration, do universities offer support system in trauma informed interface, your claim will go through it, run it through all other cases, and then match it with all the other cases\u2026\n\n* I have problems explaining the problems these problems have. What these systems are doing, they are trying to categorize our experience of misconduct in binary options. You have to have a clear definition of rape otherwise it doesn\u2019t fit in the system People are shoe-horned into particular categories, but this doesn\u2019t speak to the richness of the experience you have had.\n\n* With criminal justice we see how people are categorized. Wider categories of human improvement are not classified. \n\n* This is where the question of civil society is very important, its difficult to understand how AI makes decisions, categorizes us, and we can\u2019t anticipated. We don\u2019t even know where the data comes from and who it is being sold to.\n\n* People don\u2019t have the tech literacy to question this. Should citizens have this knowledge?\n\n* What harm is and what freedom can be?\n\n* The individual needs vs individual capabilities, and the collective needs and capacities. One person may be fooled by a system, like cambridge analytica.\n\n* I\u2019m more into that if we know what is wrong, how we can mobilize people and now we are about what is the thing that we are mobilizing about?\n\n* A lot of the time when people are faced with systematic conversation or binary boxing in for example: Employment models aren\u2019t working, you can\u2019t break out of those and you have to work with others these new ideas to making it work.\n\n* You can only break through these models and narratives by working together and creating new narratives.\n\n* When we know what we want to do and where to go, we can create a new future, something completely different from what the AI is predicting perhaps. Thus create the space that is more free.\n\n* Participatory art - the art that throws away the separation between art and the spectator. Because of the consumerist society\u2026the point is not to create \u201cgreat art\u201d but great transformative experience together with other people. Example of the Borderland. They come into this world, change the mindset, lots of the traditional concepts start to break. Creating completely new reality. Tackling the imposed machine. There is something there but don\u2019t know what.\n\n----\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\">7. What will general principles about what we consider good or bad look like or work in practice? </h3>\n\n-------\n\n* Following the \u201csubstantial freedom\u201d framework a  **code of behaviour**  should be established and monitored, by which all categories playing a role in developing algorithms - scientists developing Algorithms, politicians supporting/calling for their use, public and private administrators using them - should ask themselves:  **What is the effect on the capabilities of people effected by the algorithms?**\n* Analogic/dialogic \u2026. Online/Offline  **Experimenting platforms**  combining the two is a priority. In particular, it should be a practice for public administrations and politicians to create dialogic platforms where the above code of behaviour is checked.\n* Education/sensibilization on the implementation of the above conceptual framework in order to identify good/bad uses is a priority. It should first of all engage kids from a very early age: a new saga of cautionary tales \u2026 would help.\n\n* Since AI can produce either bad effects (harm) or good effects \u2026 the appropriate conceptual framework should offer a definition of bad/good so as to\n   * assess current uses of AI,\n   * mobilize people both \u201cagainst\u201d bad uses and \u201cfor\u201d good uses\u201d\n   * design, experiment and revise alternative \u201cgood\u201d uses\n* Sen\u2019s concept of Substantial Freedom (A Theory of Justice) is a choice: the capability approach, where we consider \u201cgood\u201d all moves/actions that improve the capacity/capability of every person to do what considers valuable (not futile capacities, but central to one\u2019s life: dignity, learning, health, freedom to move, human relations, \u2026)\n* This approach does not incapsulate what is \u201cbad\u201d or \u201charmful\u201d in a rigid box, but it calls for a participatory/societal assessment of how the general principle should be implemented, an assessment that can be continuously updated through public debate\n* Not so new: it was used by lawyers in the corporate assessment of \u201cjust\u201d/\u201dunjust\u201d fiduciary duties and business judgement rule in the US\n* Which reminds us that the participatory process/platforms can be of different kinds:\n* In the judiciary\n* In working councils\n* In town councils a la Barcelona\n* Mixing dialogical/analogical debate\n\n\n* I look at automation and documentation at violence registration, do universities offer support system in trauma informed interface, your claim will go through it, run it through all other cases, and then match it with all the other cases\u2026\n\n* I have problems explaining the problems these problems have. What these systems are doing, they are trying to categorize our experience of misconduct in binary options.\n\n* You have to have a clear definition of rape otherwise it doesn\u2019t fit in the system\n\n* People are shoe-horned into particular categories, but this doesn\u2019t speak to the richness of the experience you have had.\n\n* With criminal justice we see how people are categorized. Wider categories of human improvement are not classified.\n\n* This is where the question of civil society is very important, its difficult to understand how AI makes decisions, categorizes us, and we can\u2019t anticipated. We don\u2019t even know where the data comes from and who it is being sold to.\n\n* People don\u2019t have the tech literacy to question this. Should citizens have this knowledge?\n\n* What harm is and what freedom can be?\n\n* the problem here is that all of this data exists and all of it sudden was opened. It is important to distinguish it was just the side effect.\n\n* maybe five years ago FB opened its graph and it opened up FBs capabilities. I was having a blast with it, was a party trick for me. This is what cambridge analytica used. We were able to be coming our own CIA\u2019s.\n\n* It\u2019s not only does it give us more capability, but what do we use these capabilities for. Maybe some have too much responsibilities with it?\n\n\n------\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\">8. What is something you are struggling with? What is out there to make our own biases less visible to the algorithms? </h3>\n\n--------\n\n* The individual needs vs individual capabilities, and the collective needs and capacities. One person may be fooled by a system, like cambridge analytica.\n\n* Elections, Cambridge analytica, Facebook\n\n* Algorithms like Facebook are pulling us into a certain bias. Gathering data and classifying a person based on a lot of data around. If I am moved from one reality to another, the categorization of me is probably not the same. Even in a certain culture. Behaviour and constant interaction influenced by culture.\n\n* If myself am less biased the algorithms are less likely to classify me.\n\n* How conscious I am myself about my own bias.\n\n* It is really easy to respond to this, oh, maybe if I only share part, than that could be a meaningful intervention. Sometimes it can be. Mozilla for example has add ons. We can do that individually.\n\n* But maybe the scope of our change should go beyond individual actions.\n\n* Content moderation in books by Mary Gray or Sarah Roberts - tracking the work on how tech companies more their content moderation work to India for example, the workers are paid at the low rate and required to impose western standards on what the behaviour on social media should look like. The norms are being translated by the economic models of the platforms\n\n* The scale is so much bigger than us.\n\n* What are some of the lessons that the civil society has done in the past looking at the ways we can translate this\n\n--------\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> 9. How can we get emotionally engaged into the ai discussion? What do you want to push against? Where are injustices related coming out of this? </h3>\n\n-------\n\n* a group in LA - Stop LAPD surveillance, automating inequality, ranging from criminal justice, homelessnes\u2026to uncover the ways in which algorithms are used for surveillance. People got together to demand that the police releases surveillance policies. They were able to uncover the full scope, pushing back against the LAPD. Intervention takes a long time and needs a lot of work.\n\n* the problem isn\u2019t the algorithm, We have a tool: like a knife, it can be used for cooking in the kitchen or killing someone. Same with algorithms. Algorithms and the engineers cost a lot of money.\n\n* we have image recognition, we can create images, so if an algorithm is able to shape \u2014 it is possible and that is scary for em as a parents\n\n\n* Use of AI in judicial and social welfare, like in housing projects who gets a house, based on an algorithm. But people need to have someone recognize them as a human people, But we aren\u2019t recognized as human beings anymore, discrimination grows because the human to human contact is no longer there. But the problem is that is that there are sooo many more things happening that are not implicit. The way labor was exploited in capitalism, enormous change happened. But now this is being copied again. But it isn\u2019t causing an enormous reaction. The unions are weak.\n\n* Credit for a household going to banks. Information about our behaviour. Families are asked a high rate, the reduction of social justice. Where does the right-wing voter come from? There is a big job of just making clear what is happening. What happened in the State was evident, but here we lack information, children should understand.\n\n* We need to:\n\n* Educate, how for bad and for good it can used\n* Judiciary needs to be brought into the game\n* We need to bring back people\u2019s wellbeing into it.\n* It isn\u2019t necessarily about tech, it\u2019s about people. The solution isn\u2019t marketization\n\n-------\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\">10. In terms of mobilization and justice, perception of the actions and reactions of justice. We\u2019ve seen the same thing playing out in different places for different reasons. Obvious injustice - the link between the situation and the AI land where this is scaled up. What happens when it scales up?</h3>\n\n-------\n\n* labor, women, kids, citizens, consumers. It can react to a machine, but it is also a reaction to social issues, national bargaining in negotiation of algorithms. People are coming together against the gig economy. The platform is private, its proprietary, they are angry. They know there is misuse.\n\n* In the US, if you read the amount of literature by women on gender, there\u2019s an abundance, but within the EU this is not the case.\n\n* With regards to kids\u2019 privacy, their are flashes of anger, but no movements.\n\n* With users of mobility services, there is some action from citizens. For example in Milan they are now trying to launch a platform for mobility.\n\n* On anger, you always have to have a structure. Otherwise it may be used by the wrong people or die out.\n\n* Social justice: is this algorithm being used to enhance or reduce the capabilities of humans. On all the different fields.\n\n* Putting the structure on the anger. You need to turn it into a request.\n\n* We\u2019re not talking enough about the consequences. I personally do not feel threatened to automation, but many people are. I don\u2019t believe in any of the numbers that go about. What is really happening is the quality of jobs with reflection on people\u2019s lives, relations, the capacity of algorithms\u2026people are being told one day to another if they will work. This is killing their lives. The unions - representing labor, have a reason to mobilize people. If you are looking for a bomb shell I would study them more, the role of people like us. The unions are not equipped these days, we were told they are not necessary anymore, sometimes conservative. I would invest in capacitation of the union.\n\n* it\u2019s like the amazon example, they weren\u2019t unionized, but they protested and had demands and got them, and unionized after. But I am stressing that labor is a large area where things come along.\n\n* We are trying to understand new systems and optimization of their functions. What happens when the system causes externalities? optimization systems make population wide decisions. Giving a bunch of signals - example of uber (feedback loops, to maximize their profits). The app sensing cars - getting you out of the traffic. Caused problems in smaller streets. The app wasn\u2019t able to change the algorithm, the municipality can\u2019t do anything. The citizens install roadblocks as a solution. Can we build systems to help people against optimization systems. POTs. Facebook matching people to the advertisers - people are subjected to data getting to them regardless of how they interact on the platform. Agency is very limited because it\u2019s about the whole infrastructure.\n\n* workers at amazon wanted to a strike, but amazon knew and got 200 extra people, so they could continue., After that they created another warehouse, so it couldn\u2019t be disrupted.\n\n* There are going to be local wins for a bit, but it will take a bit for a larger win.\n\n* The most of the work in the AI is the migration and race. We shouldn\u2019t go just the labor way. The migrants are getting organized but they don\u2019t have labor unions.\n\n* in Lebanon and Morocco - riots over something related to the AI. in one case taxing, banning of whatsapp. Because of income? Maybe. But whatsapp also introduced the signal protocol. What it took for people to go to the streets and protest against government was for their rights to be removed (those they didn\u2019t have a few years back).\n\n* People have abilities, and people are upset, we have network systems, if people would map out all the uber drivers ad ping them, they will do something.\n\n* There\u2019s an example of care in the states, where due to an algorithm peoples care was reduced from 8 to 4 hours. But they didn;t want to explain how the system worked. But they were violating the rights of these people.\n\n* Another state in the US: employment benefits - combining two different data sets, the system wasn\u2019t able to sync the system together so people weren\u2019t able to receive unemployment benefits. Companies will always hide behind the trade secrecy, but why the state considers this should be above human rights?\n\n* Justin had a few examples we should add here\n\n\n---------\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\">11. Why are we putting the wellbeing of people behind proprietary systems? We have a lot of things like roads with are public, you can\u2019t make a public road and make it private. But for some reason, we don\u2019t have the same idea about data, and why not? </h3>\n\n----------\n\n* if you perceive the data is being used out of control then you are boycotting it. The results of systematic mistakes, decisions have been taken by the private corporations and when the public sector is using them it is doing for its own purposes. Talking about the problem that is not in algorithm but our pressure is taken out of context, the common discourse has taken the public sector out. Even the illusion of internet as being something out of the control of the state. The state has been wrongly used. Even in the education - the teachers in Italy weren\u2019t given explanations why they are being placed somewhere. But this is not because of the data. The algorithm was badly used.\n\n* are we not being radical enough? If we put a censor anywhere out in a place, including a car, and that data MUST be completely public. If we make these legislations\n* we are from Sweden, no minimum wage, negotiation between unions, but at some point the legislation was put in place which allowed them to lower that power. We have to make sure that at the EU level these companies can act in this way. We need to find out what those things are.\n\n* gender has become more visible in the last ten years because the perception changed. The oppression that comes with capital is something that became visible with the social movement. Things can be made visible.\n\n* There\u2019s an example of care in the states, where due to an algorithm peoples care was reduced from 8 to 4 hours. But they didn;t want to explain how the system worked. But they were violating the rights of these people.\n\n* Another state in the US: employment benefits - combining two different data sets, the system wasn\u2019t able to sync the system together so people weren\u2019t able to receive unemployment benefits.

We only need this data once, which later becomes governed by something different. The algorithm becomes irrevocable. How do you challenge that? Even if you own your data people will sell it.\n\n------\n\n<h3 id=\"heading--1\"> 13. Where is the space in which humans can have agency over these issues? </h3>\n\n-------\n\n* The three steps: let them pay taxes; mobility of capital\n\n* We are discussing this within these constraints, because we can\u2019t change the whole world, but if there\u2019s some solidarity between the unions \u2014 organised labor, if we can give them higher capacity, and then they won\u2019t let them be abused, it is doable. They are very weak technological speaking, there is no negotiation anymore.\n\n* In order to move ahead and to make the most of all ideas and human resources working these days on AI, we need both to understand where potential mobilization is taking place or it might take place, and to have a conceptual framework to move ahead.\n\n    * Since AI can produce either bad effects (harm) or good effects \u2026 the appropriate conceptual framework should offer a definition of bad/good so as to\n   * assess current uses of AI,\n   * mobilize people both \u201cagainst\u201d bad uses and \u201cfor\u201d good uses\u201d\n   * design, experiment and revise alternative \u201cgood\u201d uses\n* Sen\u2019s concept of Substantial Freedom (A Theory of Justice) is a choice: the capability approach, where we consider \u201cgood\u201d all moves/actions that improve the capacity/capability of every person to do what considers valuable (not futile capacities, but central to one\u2019s life: dignity, learning, health, freedom to move, human relations, \u2026)\n* This approach does not incapsulate what is \u201cbad\u201d or \u201charmful\u201d in a rigid box, but it calls for a participatory/societal assessment of how the general principle should be implemented, an assessment that can be continuously updated through public debate\n* Not so new: it was used by lawyers in the corporate assessment of \u201cjust\u201d/\u201dunjust\u201d fiduciary duties and business judgement rule in the US\n* Which reminds us that the participatory process/platforms can be of different kinds:\n* In the judiciary\n* In working councils\n* In town councils a la Barcelona\n* Mixing dialogical/analogical debate\n\n* **Which are the potential ACTORS of mobilization?**\n\n   * **Organised Labour**  : automation, bad jobs, gig economy, low wages\n    * Women: AI machism\n    * Kids: sexual abuses, porno\n    * Citizens: mobility\n    * Citizens: health \u2026 a dimension of life where people are becoming awareof bad uses (insurance, use of DNA)\n\n* **Therefore, one should move forward according to the following sequence:**\n\n   * Identify, country by country or even places by places, where people\u2019s concern on bad uses (or on forgone good uses) is high and there it is being organised: i.e. where there is a potential demand for \u201ccompetence support\u201d, both at conceptual and technological level\n    * Concentrate on these contexts and provide them with the conceptual framework\n     * Turn the \u201cpars destruens\u201d into a \u201cpars costruens\u201d\n     * Building at EU level a network that allows horizontal comparison for the same issues both of threats, actions and results\n     * Ensuring at EU level the availability of a competence centre that deals (not necessarily solve, but ai least identify and tackles) with the meta-obstacles preventing the implementation or curtailing the survival of\u201cgood\u201d uses.\n\n* **Complementary activities that emerged from debate:**\n\n    * Following the \u201csubstantial freedom\u201d framework a  **code of behaviour**  should be established and monitored, by which all categories playing a role in developing algorithms - scientists developing Algorithms, politicians supporting/calling for their use, public and private administrators using them - should ask themselves:  **What is the effect on the capabilities of people effected by the algorithms?**\n    * Analogic/dialogic \u2026.

Agency is very limited because it\u2019s about the whole infrastructure.\n\n* workers at amazon wanted to a strike, but amazon knew and got 200 extra people, so they could continue., After that they created another warehouse, so it couldn\u2019t be disrupted.\n\n* There are going to be local wins for a bit, but it will take a bit for a larger win.\n\n* The most of the work in the AI is the migration and race. We shouldn\u2019t go just the labor way. The migrants are getting organized but they don\u2019t have labor unions.\n\n* If actors say they need algorithms: we need to ask them why? \n\n* we need to ask different questions, we need to ask a fundamental question: why are we buying into these systems and who hold the powers? Individual agency is extremely limited, so we need to look collectively at taking action.\n\n* There is not going to be a single collective that will resolve this.\n\n* I\u2019m more into that if we know what is wrong how we can mobilize people and now we are about what is the thing that we are mobilizing about.\n\n* A lot of the time when people are faced with systematic conversation or binary boxing in for example: Employment models aren\u2019t working, you can\u2019t break out of those and you have to work with others these new ideas to making it work.\n\n* You can only break through these models and narratives by working together and creating new narratives.\n\n* When we know what we want to do and where to go, we can create a new future, something completely different from what the AI is predicting perhaps. Thus create the space that is more free.\n\n* Participatory art - the art that throws away the separation between art and the spectator. Because of the consumerist society\u2026the point is not to create \u201cgreat art\u201d but great transformative experience together with other people. Example of the Borderland. They come into this world, change the mindset, lots of the traditional concepts start to break. Creating completely new reality. Tackling the imposed machine. There is something there but don\u2019t know what.-\n\n* something as vague as my data became very big, most people understand there is something about data we should care about. We only need this data once, which later becomes governed by something different. The algorithm becomes irrevocable. How do you challenge that? Even if you own your data people will sell it.\n\n\n\n-----\n### <h2 id=\"heading--1\"> Post Workshop Participant reflections </h2>\n\n-----\n\n<h3 id=\"heading--1\"> Matthias</h3> \n\n[Original Post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/were-you-at-the-ai-justice-workshop-on-19-11-share-your-notes-and-thoughts-here/11694/6?u=nadia) \n\n* **Value-based software architecture.**  Scuttlebutt deprioritized making their software available for multiple devices based on their values of \u201cthis being software that is made for people who only have one device\u201d. That\u2019s a major architectural decision, which might not be possible to adjust later without rewriting the whole software. So they really poured their values into their software. In comparison, politics is not yet good at getting its values implemented into technological developments. So we need a better process that implements our values into our technology. It\u2019s about a process strong in accountability.\n* **What is human?**  If an actor (any party / organization) says they are human centric, they often do not even define what \u201chuman centric\u201d means in their case. For example, \u201chuman\u201d in \u201cEuropean human centric Internet\u201d is left undefined. This generates conflict potential, as it stays so general.\n* **The economics behind AI.**  There\u2019s an interesting study of \u201cthe cost of developing a universal chips after the end of Moore\u2019s law\u201d. It means that now that we\u2019re at the end of Moore\u2019s law, the money sunk into developing faster chips is unlikely to come back. So instead the industry took a risk by developing  *specialized*  chips. There are two main types of such chips: AI and blockchain. That\u2019s the only reason why AI became a hype and we\u2019re talking about it: it is pushed on us, because industry needed a new profitable outlet for investments, and high levels of capital investment are backing AI already. \u201cIf we are not buying it, it\u2019s going to go down. If we are not buying it, we are going to go down.\u201d We are still in the process of making that choice if we (also: the Commission) want to invest money into AI.\n* **Good and bad AI architecture.**  Let\u2019s differentiate between \u201cAI for research and solutions\u201d and \u201cAI for the production of services\u201d. The first type is benign research aimed to solve intricate problems, for example done by universities. The second type is commercial SaaS software that scoops in data out of profit interest of the company. Maybe Google maps might in the future adapt your routing so that you see adverts of parties that paid Google for audience for these adverts.This means: the problem of this is about the economics of who runs the datacenters: Amazon and Microsoft and Google built \u201cclouds\u201d, data centers for people to run their applications. Due to economics of scale, they provide the cheapest solution, but also are able to monitor and keep the data going through them. This is an undemocratic process for plain economic reasons, and it\u2019s a hard problem to crack.\n* **The structure defines the function.**  The type of governance structure defines how a new technology gets used. So it may be that we have allowed the wrong governance structures to happen, which will lead to the wrong outcomes of AI technology. In addition, Google and Facebook have been advertising companies but are not anymore \u2013 trying to rule them in as advertisers with regulation is already not applicable anymore, instead we should rule in their new structure of \u201cAI first\u201d companies.\n* **Is AI anti-human by definition?**  What AI (as rebranded Bayesian statistics) does is to put the individual differences between human beings (everyone\u2019s \u201cspark of the divine\u201d) into the epsilon, the error term at the end of the equation. That makes AI non-human-centric by design. Because the definition of human for an individual is \u201cthat which cannot be predicted by AI, which is not part of the \u2018normal\u2019\u201d.\n* **On tech interfering with relationships.**  Intermediating the patient-doctor relationship with data collecting and analyzing systems has degraded the value of that relationship. Because medicine is not about diagnosis, but prognosis: improving a patient\u2019s future condition, and that is a negotiation with the individual, and that individual might be very much non-average, refusing certain treatments etc., and should have and keep a right to that individualness. That still allows for tech systems that could benefit relationships \u2013 it\u2019s just that the tech systems we have currently in medicine do not do that.\n\n####  Personal reflections\n\nI want to clearly distinguish between systems of exploitation and the technology itself. Any system of exploitation, including capitalism, will find and use  *any*  new technological option in exploitative ways. The history of digital innovation and media innovation in more general is quite rich in that: before AI for behavior prediction it has been targeted advertising, tracking, mass surveillance programs by governments, weaponized drones, propaganda micro-targeting, mass media use for state propaganda etc\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s purely a social problem, not a technological one. Adding one more technology cannot make it much worse \u2026 nukes are already around, so what technology could offer significantly worse potential outcomes? So to deal with it, you don\u2019t have to make legislation for AI, but against capitalism.\n\nAI in itself is a nice tool in the toolkit, and easily allows for beneficial use. Personal example: my [open source coffee sorter ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/7122) project uses deep learning based image classifiers to relieve small-scale farmers from sorting your coffee by hand.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> Inge </h3>\n\n[Original Post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/were-you-at-the-ai-justice-workshop-on-19-11-share-your-notes-and-thoughts-here/11694/2?u=nadia). \n\nThanks so much @nadia for organizing such an important event on such a crucial topic. For me the most important takeaways for now (as you said, we\u2019ve just started scratching the surface of something so detrimental) are the following:\n\n1. we need to increase tech literacy about the systems in place: if we (individuals, governments, policymakers) don\u2019t know how the black boxes work, how do we know that what they promise us is actually what results they give us. How can we question outcomes if we aren\u2019t informed about the manner in which the systems arrive at conclusions?\n2. we also need to understand the tipping point into creating action: when was the last time you really got upset and demanded change? The problem lays again with the fact that we often don\u2019t even know about the injustices (from increased traffic, to the inability to speak to people instead of machines). This topic I think relates to the first point. We can\u2019t be angry to the point of taking action (protests, etc), if we don\u2019t even realize/understand where the injustice is coming from. Side note: we may even want to take it further: should we use certain systems if we don\u2019t know how they work?\n3. If actors say they need certain systems, we need to ask them why. Why not do it by hand? The idea is that these systems will solve everything, but they are just accelerating broken systems.\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> Alberto</h3>\n\n[Original Post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-i-learned-on-regulating-ai-and-a-human-centric-internet/11699)\n\nIn general,  **the group felt the need to spend quite some time to get a grip on a shared idea of what AI actually is** , and how it works, before he could discuss its regulation. Occasionally, the discussion veered into being quite technical, and not everybody could follow it all the time, even if we had an over-representation of computer scientists and digital activists. This is in itself a result: if this crowd struggles to get it, democratic participation is going to be pretty difficult for the general public.\n\nWe used [Chatham House rule ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule), so I in what follows I do not attribute statements to anyone in particular.\n\nWe kicked off by reminding ourselves that the new von der Leyen Commission has promised to [tackle AI within the first 100 days of taking office](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/blog-post/von-der-leyen-new-commission-take-aim-at-ai-legislation/). Brussels is mostly happy with how the GDPR thing played out, that is by recognizing the EU as the de facto \u201cregulatory superpower\u201d. The AI regulation in the pipeline is expected to have a similar effect to that of GDPR.\n\n**Participants then expressed some concern around the challenges of regulating AI** . For example:\n\n* A directive may be the wrong instrument. The law is good at enshrining principles (\u201chuman-centric AI\u201d), but in the tech industry we are seeing  *everyone* , including FAANG, claiming to adhere to the same principles. What we seem to be missing is an accountable process to translate principles into technical choices. For example, elsewhere I have told the story of how the developers of [Scuttlebutt ](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) justified their refusal to give their users multiple-device accounts in terms of values: \u201cwe want to serve the underconnected, and those guys do not own multiple devices. Multiple device account is a first world problem, and should be deprioritized\u201d.\n* The AI story is strongly vendor-driven: a solution looking for a problem. Lawmaking as a process is naturally open to the contribution of industry, and this openness risks giving even more market power to the incumbents.\n* AI uses big data and lots of computing power, so it tends to live in the cloud as infrastructure. But the cloud is itself super-concentrated, it is infrastructure in few private hands. The rise of AI brings even more momentum to the concentration process. This brings us back to an intuition that has been circulating in this forum, namely that you need antitrust policy to do tech policy, at least in the current situation.\n* The term \u201cAI\u201d has come to mean \u201cmachine learning on big data\u201d. The governance of the data themselves is an unsolved problem, with major consequences for AI. In the health sector, for example, clinical data tend to be simply entrusted to large companies: the British NHS [gave them](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.co.uk%2F2019%2F09%2F19%2Ffive_nhs_trusts_do_data_deal_with_google_one_says_no%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHAd8EamUp9LY1ulHdC7mufXEXJcQ) to Deep Mind; a [similar operation ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Feuropa.today.it%2Fattualita%2Funa-scelleratezza-consegnare-le-cartelle-cliniche-degli-italiani-all-ibm-rossi-attacca-il-governo.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFKARv42-MfE-a-cJN4t3VXIOvu6g) between the Italian government and IBM Watson was attempted, but failed, because data governance in Italy is with the regions, and they refused to release the data. We learned much about the state of the art of the reflection on data governance at MyData2019: to our surprise [there appears to be a consensus](https://edgeryders.eu/t/10893) among scholars on how to go about data governance, but it is not being translated into law. That work is  *very*  unfinished, and it should be finished  *before*  opening the AI can of worms.\n* AI has a large carbon footprint. Even when it does improve on actual human problems, it does so at the cost of worsening the climate, not in a win-win scenario.\n* The Internet should be \u201chuman-centric\u201d. But machine learning is basically statistical analysis: high-dimensional multivariate statistical models. When it is done on humans, its models (for example a recommendation algo) encode each human into a database, and then models you in terms of who you are similar to: for example, a woman between 35 and 45 who speaks Dutch and watches stand-up comedy on Netflix. Everything not standardizable, everything that makes you  *you* , gets pushed to the error term of the model. That is hardly human-centric, because it leads to optimizing systems in terms of abstract \u201ctypical humans\u201d or \u201ctarget groups\u201d or whatever.\n\nAs a result of this situation,  **the group was not even in agreement that AI is worth the trouble and the money that it costs** . Two participants argued the opposite sides, both, interestingly, using examples from medicine. The AI-enthusiast noted that AI is getting good at diagnosing medical conditions. The AI-sceptic noted that medicine is not diagnosis-centric, but prognosis-centric; it has no value if it does not improve human life. And the prognosis must always be negotiated with the patient. IT in medicine has historically cheapened the relationship between patient and healer, with the latter \"classifying \" the former in terms of a standard data structure for entry into a database.\n\nSomebody quoted recent studies on the use of AI in medicine. The state of the art is:\n\n* Diagnostic AI does not perform significantly better than human pathologists. ([Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(19)30123-2/fulltext), [Ar.xiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07372))\n* Few studies do any external validation of results. Additionally, deep learning models are poorly reported. ([Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(19)30123-2/fulltext))\n* Incorrect models bias (and therefore deteriorate) the work of human pathologists ([Nature ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0300-7), [Ar.xiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07372))\n* There are risks that AI will be used to erode the doctor-patient relationship ([Nature ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0300-7))\n\nBased on this, the participant argued that at the moment there is no use case for AI in medicine.\n\n![image.png](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/4/47bf93cadf44c888b699b0314dd34e23e6099e08.png)\n\n*Image credit: [XKCD ](https://xkcd.com/)*\n\nWe agreed that not just AI, but all optimization tools are problematic, because they have to make the choice of what, exactly, gets optimized. What tends to get optimized is what the entity deploying the model wants. Traffic is a good example: apparently innocent choices as what to optimize for turn out to have huge consequences. When you design traffic, do you optimize for driver safety? Or for pedestrian safety? Of minimize time spent on the road? Airport layout is designed to maximize pre-flight spending: after you clear security, the only way to the gate goes through a very large duty free shop. This is \u201coptimal\u201d, but not necessary optimal  *for you* .\n\nWe next moved to  **data governance** . Data are, of course, AI\u2019s raw material, and only those who have access to data can deploy AI models. A researcher called [Paul Oliver Dehaye](https://paulolivier.dehaye.org/stories/about.html) wants to model discrimination of certain workers. Do do this, he needs to pool the personal data from different individuals into what is called a \u201cdata trust\u201d. Data trusts are one of several models for data governance being floated about; the [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu/what-decode)\u2019s data commons are another.\n\nIn this discussion, even the GDPR\u2019s success appears to have some cracks. For example, Uber is using it to refuse it to give drivers their data, claiming that would impact the riders\u2019 privacy. A participant claimed that the GDPR has a blind spot in that it has nothing to say about standards for data portability. U.S. tech companies have a project called Data Transfer, where they are dreaming up those standards, and doing so in a way that will benefit them most (again). Pragmatically, she thought the EU should set its own standards for this.\n\nWe ended with some  **constructive suggestions** . One concerned data governance itself. as noted above, the MyData community and other actors in the tech policy space have made substantial intellectual progress on data governance. Were this progress to be enshrined into EU legislation and standards setting, this would maybe help mitigate the potential of the AI industry to worsen inequalities. For example, saying \u201ceveryone has a right to own their data\u201d is not precise enough. It makes a huge difference whether personal data are considered to be a freehold commodity or an unalienable human right. In the former case, people can sell their data to whomever they want: data would thus be like material possessions. In this case, market forces are likely to concentrate their ownership in few hands, because data are much more valuable when aggregated in humongous piles of big data. But in the latter case, data are like the right to freedom. I have it, but I am not allowed to sell myself into slavery. In this scenario, data ownership does not concentrate.\n\nAnother constructive suggestions concerned enabling a next-generation eIDAS, to allow for \u201cdisposable online identities\u201d. These are pairs of cryptographic keys that you would use for the purpose of accessing a service: instead of showing your ID to the supermarket cashier when you buy alcoholic drinks, you would show them a statement digitally signed by the registrar that says more or less \u201cthe owner of this key pair is over 18\u201d, and then sign it with your private key. This way, the supermarket knows you are over 18, but does not who you are. It does have your public key, but you can also never use that key pair anymore \u2013 that\u2019s what makes it disposable.\n\nFurther suggestions included legislating on mandatory auditability of algorithms (there is even a NGO doing work on this, [AlgorithmWatch](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/)), investments in early data literacy in education, and designing for cultural differences: Europeans care more about privacy, whereas many people in Asia are relatively uninterested in it.\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> Fabrizio </h3>\n\nIn order to move ahead and to make the most of all ideas and human resources working these days on AI, we need both to understand where potential mobilization is taking place or it might take place, and to have a conceptual framework to move ahead. \n\t\u2022\tSince AI can produce either bad effects (harm) or good effects \u2026  the appropriate conceptual framework should offer a definition of bad/good so as to\n\t\u2022\tassess current uses of AI, \n\t\u2022\tmobilize people both \u201cagainst\u201d bad uses and \u201cfor\u201d good uses\u201d\n\t\u2022\tdesign, experiment and revise alternative \u201cgood\u201d uses\n\t\u2022\tSen\u2019s concept of Substantial Freedom (A Theory of Justice) is a choice: the capability approach, where we consider \u201cgood\u201d all moves/actions that improve the capacity/capability of every person to do what considers valuable (not futile capacities, but central to one\u2019s life: dignity, learning, health, freedom to move, human relations, \u2026)\n\t\u2022\tThis approach does not incapsulate what is \u201cbad\u201d or \u201charmful\u201d in a rigid box, but it calls for a participatory/societal assessment of how the general principle should be implemented, an assessment that can be continuously updated through public debate\n\t\u2022\tNot so new: it was used by lawyers in the corporate assessment of \u201cjust\u201d/\u201dunjust\u201d  fiduciary duties and business judgement rule in the US\n\t\u2022\tWhich reminds us that the participatory process/platforms can be of different kinds:\n\t\u2022\tIn the judiciary\n\t\u2022\tIn working councils\n\t\u2022\tIn town councils a la Barcelona\n\t\u2022\tMixing dialogical/analogical debate\n\nWhich are the potential ACTORS of mobilization?\n\t\u2022\tOrganised Labour: automation, bad jobs, gig economy, low wages\n\t\u2022\tWomen: AI machism\n\t\u2022\tKids: sexual abuses, porno \n\t\u2022\tCitizens: mobility\n\t\u2022\tCitizens: health \u2026 a dimension of life where people are becoming awareof bad uses (insurance, use of DNA)\n\nTherefore, one should move forward according to the following sequence:\n\t\u2022\tIdentify, country by country or even places by places, where people\u2019s concern on bad uses (or on forgone good uses) is high and there it is being organised: i.e. where there is a potential demand for \u201ccompetence support\u201d, both at conceptual and technological level\n\t\u2022\tConcentrate on these contexts and provide them with the conceptual framework\n\t\u2022\tTurn the \u201cpars destruens\u201d into a \u201cpars costruens\u201d\n\t\u2022\tBuilding at EU level a network that allows horizontal comparison for the same issues both of threats, actions and results\n\t\u2022\tEnsuring at EU level the availability of a competence centre that deals (not necessarily solve, but ai least identify and tackles) with the meta-obstacles preventing the implementation or curtailing the survival of\u201cgood\u201d uses.\nComplementary activities that emerged from debate:\n\t\u2022\tFollowing the \u201csubstantial freedom\u201d framework a code of behaviour should be established and monitored, by which all categories playing a role in developing algorithms - scientists developing Algorithms, politicians supporting/calling for their use, public and private administrators using them -  should ask themselves: What is the effect on the capabilities of people effected by the algorithms?\n\t\u2022\tAnalogic/dialogic \u2026. Online/Offline Experimenting platforms combining the two is a priority. In particular, it should be a practice for public administrations and politicians to create dialogic platforms where the above code of behaviour is checked. \n\t\u2022\tEducation/sensibilization on the implementation of the above conceptual framework in order to identify good/bad uses is a priority. It should first of all engage kids from a very early age: a new saga of cautionary tales \u2026 would help.\n\n----\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--1\"> PRE- FESTIVAL INTERVIEWS </h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> Overview of all 10 Stories: Generic audience </h3>\n\nExperts working at the cutting edge of tech, policy and human rights spaces call for greater consideration to be given to the way that AI is altering the very fabric of society. Both academics and policy makers agree that current AI systems risk amplifying existing human biases that entrench inequality - not least because of the widespread, and misguided, perception that data is inherently neutral. Systems for the reporting of sexual assault, for example, are encoded with developers\u2019 assumptions about sexual violence which do not grasp the complexity of victims\u2019 experiences. Those working and researching in the field caution that AI systems are only as unbiased as the humans who build them, and that continuing to give AI undue weight will cause serious harm to the most vulnerable in society.\n\nAcross medicine, law, entrepreneurship and gender studies, concern is growing that the pressure to innovate for its own sake comes at great risk to privacy, protection and human rights. Experts caution that companies in both the public and private sectors are rushing to implement technology they don\u2019t fully understand, and that it is crucial due care and consideration is taken when building these systems to ensure they are value-driven and accountable. Unchecked digitisation in the fields of medicine, social work and the reporting of sexual assault fails to recognise human needs which are more nuanced, individualised and unpredictable than AI can fathom. It is critical we ensure that AI is designed and used in such a way that it serves society\u2019s needs \u2013 not the other way around.\n\n#### Examples from each story\n\n* Marco: In predictive medicine, there are so many biological variables that scaling data up can decrease precision\n* Corinne: complex encryption systems built to protect an activist were found to be lacking when a police officer simply stole his phone from his hand.\n* Peter:\n* Seda:\n* Hugi:\n* Kate:\n* Justin: mentioned two examples in a comment somewhere\u2026\n* Oliver:\n* Fabrizio:\n* Alberto:\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--1\"> Social media updates for media-friendly summary articles </h4>\n\n1. Self-reinforcing loop of data puts human rights at risk\n\n2. Unchecked digital expansion could be a force for democratisation \u2013 or further entrench inequality\n\n3. It is critical that AI serves people \u2013 not the other way around.\n\n4. Discourse must move from technology to societal impact\n\n5. Perception of data as inherently neutral is dangerous to society\n\n6. Putting human rights at the forefront of digital expansion is critical\n\n7. One-size-fits all approach to AI in public services breeds division and intolerance\n\n8. Interoperability key to sustainable innovation\n\n9. Meaningful debate on AI must be prioritised above innovation.\n\n10. Digital space currently failing to protect women and victims of sexual violence\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> The rush to implement AI too widely and simplistically could have disastrous consequences </h3>\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--1\"> A conversation with Marco Manca </h4>\n\nMarco Manca is an interdisciplinary researcher in mathematics and informational systems with an educational background in medicine. He founded the [SCimPulse Foundation](http://www.scimpulse.org/about-us/), which he still directs, and is also part of several scientific organisations and commissions, including the working group of NATO for human control over autonomous systems.\n\nMarko feels there is a lot of excitement about AI and a push to accelerate its implementation widely - but that it is crucial we consider AI a \u201cnifty tool\u201d to use with awareness, rather than an impeccable \u201cleader\u201d that must not be questioned. AI systems are only as good as the data inputted and the questions asked of them by humans. This means that the conclusions returned are not free of human biases, but rather potentially amplify them. Essentially, as they are used now, AI systems simply return the same results as humans would, just \u201cfaster and dumber.\u201d\n\nThis is a concern because of the rush to implement AI, particularly in the field of medicine. In medicine there is an expectation of precision, but with so many biological variables, the more precise you get the more you diverge, so large scale information potentially becomes less valuable. For example, in the 1970s, various tools were introduced to help doctors predict the likelihood of certain diseases, but attempts to refine these profiles over the years have hit a barrier. Just as you could play a lottery with 1/1000 odds every day for a thousand days and still not win, there is a crucial difference between \u201cthe destiny of the person in front of you right now, the destiny of every similar person.\u201d\n\nHis argument is not that we should not be developing AI, but that we must consider how we develop and implement it and how we contextualize the information it gives us.

G\u00fcrses </h4>\n\nWith an undergrad degree in international relations and mathematics, Seda is now an academic at Delft University, focussing on how to do computer science differently - utilising a interdisciplinary approach to explore both concepts of privacy and surveillance, and also looking at what communities need. They were led into this field of study by their fascination with the politics of mathematics and the biases contained within seemingly neutral numbers.\n\nThe technological landscape has changed enormously in the past few years \u2014 from static software saved on a disk that was only updated every once in a while, to software and apps that are held on services and so constantly updated and optimised. A whole new host of privacy and security issues have arisen, and thus the need for a computer science which secures and protects the needs of its users.\n\nThe negative consequences of prioritising optimisation over user experience can be seen in Google Maps and Way, which sends users down service roads to avoid freeway traffic. They don\u2019t care that this has an adverse impact on the environment and local communities, or even that it actually causes congestion in smaller roads. Further, Uber has optimised its system to outsource risk to its workers: instead of paying people for the time they work, Uber offers them a system that tells them when they are most likely to get customers so that they can manage their individual risk.\n\nWhen this kind of tech injustice is applied to public institutions such as borders and social welfare systems, the discrimination embedded in the very systems mean we are changing the fabric of society without having the necessary discussions as to whether that\u2019s something we want to do. We need to stop talking about data and algorithms and focus on the forms of government we want these technologies to have. It is crucial that the computational infrastructure boosted by AI serves people, not the other way around.\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Seda here:**  coming soon\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> Tech is not the simple solution to complex social situations.</h3>\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--1\"> A conversation with Peter Bihr </h4>\n\nPbihir co-founded ThingsCon community which advocates for a responsible, human-centric approach to the Internet of Things. Smart Cities, where the digital and physical meet and where algorithms actively impact our daily lives, is an important focal point of his work.\n\nHe proposes reframing the Smart City discourse (currently dominated by vendors of Smart City tech) away from the technology and more towards a focus on societal impact. What better urban metrics can we apply to cities increasingly governed or shaped by algorithms? Such an analytical framework would be the key to unlocking a real, meaningful debate. Smart City policies must be built around citizen/digital, human rights, and with emphasis on participatory processes, transparency and accountability.\n\nAt the most recent ThingsCon conference, Manon den Dunnen shared her experience of unintended horrific consequences of tech going wrong when police officers take phone numbers of both victims and suspects, and then Facebook algorithms then suggest one another as friends.\n\nFurther, several studies have shown policing and/or justice related algorithms were found to have racist data points (including some deemed illegal by courts yet remained in the data sets). And the policing algorithm in NYC measures effectiveness by such simplistic metrics that created incentive for officers to report selectively (for example, the systemic intimidation of rape victims to change their charge from rape to a more minor offence).\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Peter here:**  [How can we put humans/citizens first in our smart city policies?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-can-we-put-humans-citizens-first-in-our-smart-city-policies/9878/40)\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> Unchecked digital expansion could entrench existing biases and power inequality. </h3>\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--1\"> A conversation with Corinne Cath-Speth </h4>\n\nWith a background in human rights and policy, Corinne Cath-Speth worked as a policy officer for a human rights NGO in London before coming to the Oxford Internet Institute and the Alan Turing Institute to pursue her PhD. Her research focuses on human rights advocacy efforts within Internet governance, with a broader interest of how human rights NGOs are responding to the new (and old) challenges raised by emerging technologies.\n\nIn working with human rights activists, CCS saw that digital technologies - like social media - can give the plight of activists more visibility, but that often these same technologies entrench existing power inequalities and biases. She became interested in studying what happens when activists try to change the infrastructure of the internet itself, rather than simply use it. A number of well-known human rights organizations like the ACLU and EFF, actively do so by contributing to Internet governance fora. She found that these organizations are welcome and can operate in these spaces with relative ease, given their open and multistakeholder nature. At the same time, she also saw that while getting the tech \u201cright\u201d is an important part of the puzzle of human rights advocacy in the digital age, it is also a narrow frame through which to understand the broad spectrum of social concerns raised by networked technologies.\n\nCCS\u2019s work in Internet governance also led her to consider human rights advocacy in AI governance, as AI systems are raising a host of questions regarding privacy, safety, anti-discrimination and other human rights. One of the problems with developing AI advocacy programs is that many of these systems are developed by private companies, so it is difficult to gain access to their technology to examine and understand it. Many NGOs are therefore calling for the regulation of AI systems, but are facing pushback, with companies arguing that it hampers innovation. Yet, it is this same \u201cinnovation\u201d that encourages many governments to deploy AI systems. A drive for \u201cinnovation\u201d for innovation\u2019s sake is particularly concerning when it encourages governments to step into technologies that they don\u2019t fully understand or even need.\n\nObviously, a lot of human rights NGOs have been worried about these various dynamics for a while and are consistently raising their concerns\u2014 sometimes by bringing in academic work to show some of these issues. Human Rights Watch, for example, has a great program as does Amnesty International, Privacy International and Article 19. Several of the largest human rights NGOs are focusing on issues of AI systems and bias. But they\u2019re also forced to play whack-a-mole as the application of AI systems becomes more common. How to focus your resources? Which companies and applications are most concerning? Which solutions most tractable and comprehensive? Do we need sectoral guidelines, or do we need guidelines which focus on impact? Do we need self-regulatory ethics frameworks or hard data protection frameworks? All of the above? These are the issues I see a lot of NGOs grapple with and are questions I hope to discuss with you on this platform.\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Corinne here:**  [What does the future of civil society advocacy look like, given the prevalence of these digital technologies and their impact on the work that civil society is currently doing? ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-does-the-future-of-civil-society-advocacy-look-like-given-the-prevalence-of-these-digital-technologies-and-their-impact-on-the-work-that-civil-society-is-currently-doing/11118/16)\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> Self-reinforcing loop of data could put human rights at risk. </h3>\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--1\"> A conversation with Justin Nogarede </h4>\n\nJustin Nogarede works for the Foundation for European Progressive Studies, was previously at the European Commission focussing on competition law and European regulations.\n\nAs a trainee in the application law unit at the European Commission, he became aware of the issues involved in ensuring member states comply with EU law, finding that often there isn\u2019t the staff or resources available to enforce directives - for example, the directive on data protection has existed since 1995, but was not widely enforced. Justin now focuses more on data governance, and is finding that as new digital infrastructures are rolled out, they are driven by narrow efficiency concerns and are not accountable. Looking into these new infrastructures is a great opportunity to make the system more participatory and accountable - but we have to take it.\n\nFeeding existing data into AI systems can create problems - for example, when predictive policing has been shown to drive more officers into wealthy areas, as data shows a higher rate of arrests in those areas. Data therefore creates a self-reinforcing loop. Further, digital systems often rely on a binary logic, which healthcare and social problems simply don\u2019t fit. The key problem is that data is a simplification of the real world. Further, some AI systems may support a conservative bias, such as when they are used to predict which offenders are most likely to reoffend.\n\nRegulation of digital infrastructure would be a step in the right direction, and the argument that it would stifle innovation is weak - technological advances must make sense and make lives better. It may not be possible to have 100% compliance, but more involvement of public authorities (even at local level) would be a good step, as would more transparency over how these technologies function. Why is all this innovation not channelled into ways for people to live a better life?\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Justin here:**  [Why is all this innovation not being channeled into ways for people to help them live a better life?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/why-is-all-this-innovation-not-being-channeled-into-ways-for-people-to-help-them-live-a-better-life/11443/3)\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> Distributed systems promise great possibilities - and challenges.</h3>\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--1\"> A conversation with Hugi Asgeirsson </h4>\n\nEarlier this year, Hugi was in Berlin for the Data Terra Nemo conference, focussing on decentralised web applications which are hosted without traditional servers, allowing for a lot of interesting applications.\n\nThey were inspired by the human-centric community that has grown up around \u2018gossip\u2019 protocols like Scuttlebutt. It seems to be forming a playground where new and radical ideas can be tested and implemented. The original developer of Scuttlebutt, Dominic Tarr, describes his MO as: \u201cnot to build the next big thing, but rather to build the thing that inspires the next big thing, that way you don\u2019t have to maintain it\u201d and this seems to have set the tone for Scuttlebutt itself.\n\nOne of the core elements of Scuttlebutt is that users can host data for other people on the network without being directly connected to them. This has the positive effect that users in countries where internet usage is highly restricted can connect via other users - though on the other hand, this also means that users could unwittingly be hosting information they would rather not propagate. There have been instances of the Norwegian alt-right using Scuttlebutt to communicate. Scuttlebutt has been working to address this issue but solutions are imperfect so far.\n\nThe bottom line is that distributed systems such as Scuttlebutt are both democratising and empowering and they come with a whole new set of possibilities and challenges.\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Hugi here:**  [Data Terra Nemo: First report & Scuttlebutt](https://edgeryders.eu/t/data-terra-nemo-first-report-scuttlebutt/9928/4)\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> Open-source technology and interoperability are key to sustainable innovation </h3>\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--1\"> A conversation with Oliver Sauter </h4>\n\nThere is an accepted \u201claw\u201d of entrepreneurship: in order to build something valuable, you have to be ten times better than what already exists (as proven by Google + which arguably had better some better features than Facebook but failed to tempt people away). Why does this law exist and what can we do to change it?\n\nBlackforestBoi believes it comes down to: Costs to switch (time and mental effort) > additional benefit offered *~10. Such growth requirement has produced some great leaps in innovation - but these come with downsides. How would the world look if we focused more on incremental innovations?\n\nWhat is holding us back? The way companies make money for one: the 2nd quarter of 2018, Facebook lost $120bn (billion!) in stock value within 48 hours, the biggest loss of any company in history. The reason: It posted the least growth since its founding, while still making 5BN in profits the same quarter and growing by 42% since the last year. Secondly data and social lock ins creates counter incentives for interoperable formats which would make it easier for users to migrate between services or integrate them,\n\nBreaking this dynamic would require tackling the problem from multiple angles: namely allowing users to move freely between services, creating economic models that reward quality of service rather than simple growth, and ideally adopting Open-Source software to allow companies to build on one another\u2019s work.\n\nWorldBrain (dot) io is building open-source software in an attempt to enable incremental innovation, the foundation of which is Memex - an open-source privacy tool. Interoperability is baked deep into the core of Memex, it is fully open-source and WorldBrain (dot) io has no stock value, so is entirely focussed on building a sustainable service.\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Oliver here:**  [Startups\u2019 grand illusion: You have to be 10x better than whats there](https://edgeryders.eu/t/startups-grand-illusion-you-have-to-be-10x-better-than-whats-there/10221/14)\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> Civic organisations are key to turning AI technology into a force for civil justice </h3>\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--1\"> A conversation with Fabrizio Barca </h4>\n\nWith a varied background in banking and treasury and more recently inequalities and justice, Fabrizio previously worked at the EU and now with a civic organisation called the Forum for Inequality and Diversity.\n\nThe current crisis in Western countries is driven by inequality - in particular the paradox that we have the technology to create equality but instead it is producing an unprecedented concentration of knowledge and power in very few hands. This must be addressed by putting political pressure on the issues. State-owned enterprises and collective platforms where people can put together data that everyone has access to could turn these technologies into forces for social justice.\n\nA one-size-fits all approach to AI in public administration grows resentment. It deprives people of the most important thing - human connection and a sense of being recognised - which breeds intolerance, division and a loss of trust in democracy. Fabrizio is just coming to understand how effective civic organisations can be, not just in advocacy work but in taking action to shape services in local areas. He hopes to gain even more understanding through discussing the topics with a mix of people from different backgrounds.\n\n**Learn More :**  [Conversation with Fabrizio Barca Founder, Forum on Inequalities and diversity I Ex General Director, Italian Ministry of Economy & Finance](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-conversation-with-fabrizio-barca-founder-forum-on-inequalities-and-diversity-i-ex-general-director-italian-ministry-of-economy-finance/11545/2)\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1\"> Digital spaces currently failing to protect women and victims of sexual violence </h3>\n\n#### <h4 id=\"heading--1\"> A conversation with Kate J Sim</h3>\n\nA PhD researcher at Oxford Internet Institute, katejsim studies the intersection of gender-based violence and emerging technologies. Her work focuses on issues of trust, gender and sexual politics, and the double-edged role of technology in facilitating connections but also targeted harassment. While organising against campus violence she personally experienced cyberharassment and lack of support from law enforcement. More resources have become available since then, but we need to change how we conceptualise these issues and fundamentally change the design of the platforms.\n\nShe helped to form a cross-campus network that grew to a nonprofit organisation, Know Your IX. The space requires better structures in place to support mental health and protection from cyberharassment to reduce burnout. Research shows again and again that women, especially women of colour, tend to self-censor and reduce their visibility in order to survive - it is crucial we put more safeguarding in place to protect them.\n\nDigital systems designed to facilitate disclosures, collect evidence and automate reporting of sexual assault are attractive to institutions because of their efficiency - and to some extent to victims as they are perceived to be objective and neutral. However, these systems have bias encoded in them. The designers are working with their own understanding of sexual violence, which may not match victims\u2019 experiences. Some victims don\u2019t have the data literacy or English level to work the systems, which could compound their trauma. Further, the pressure to report is encoded into the design of these systems, but this is a misguided emphasis on a single optimal solution, which is not appropriate for all victims. De-emphasising reporting and focussing on \u201csmall data\u201d driven by relationship building can create a structured conversation which is rich, insightful and telling.\n\nRather than asking how tech can be fixed for the better, the more urgent and important question is: who and what are we overlooking when we turn to tech solutions? How can we support practitioners in anti-violence space, like social workers, jurors and judges, and advocates, with data and tech literacy, so that they have control over how they interpret and act on data?\n\n**Participate in the conversation with Kate here:**  [Can tech design for survivors?

Closed ecological systems are systems that involve no matter exchagne with the surrounding environment. \"These are generally manmade systems\".\u00a0\n\nI agree that perceptually closed loop systems are a fact in the human world. Sure! But I dont agree on your choice of choices, or whether your 'better choice' is actually the best choice that could be made. Closed loop systems remind me of the concept of 'closed energetic systems' from the complexity and thermodynamic perspective, the same applies here, these systems have no energetic exchange beyond their closed-containment. This is all good in theory, but there is no such thing in practice.\n\nI would offer that the same is the case here. What we refer to as closed loop systems are not in fact 'closed loop', neither energetically, nor in terms of ecological or social effect. The practice of cocreativity , from one perspective, is to create the transformative strategies, to build the organizational midi-desks into which bottom up and top down processes can plug in such that we build fully connective topolgies reflecting the mutuality of cause and effect as one global species in the hope of survival and the balance this requires. Its all well and good to attend events in the limelight and rub shoulders with state and capital, but to feign ignorance as to any terrestrial processes being closed loop, to disacknowledge the mutuality of casue and effect, is to believe that walls high enough wil shield one from the shared psycho-social environment of the times. Its never enough to blame without asking the question of how the situation is modulated by one's own perceptions actions and the stories we tell ourselves and others.

It goes back to creating spaces for the 'weird conversations'. Skillful spaces where truly new perspectives and insights can show up rather than rehashing what we have or downloading what's been done before. I haven't come across enough of them. I think there are clues in places like GalGael - where the space seeks to maintain norms that are countercultural to one degree or another. Perhaps we need to recreate @Alberto 's Star Wars bar - a physical reminder to move the conversation to new territory?\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-23 20:47:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:53.561212", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 147, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39974, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 7792, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e850210dc03d4f3ccf5916ac989c68254f8a8199.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"690\">\n\n\nSpecial thanks to @anu for this beautiful flyer :cherries:", "created_at": "2017-12-04 16:48:48.257719", "updated_at": "2017-12-04 16:49:52.301411", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 22, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 168.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3791, 3362, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41112, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 7961, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Thinking about those April dates...", "created_at": "2018-01-09 19:01:20.978549", "updated_at": "2018-01-09 19:01:20.978549", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5, "wiki": false, "reads": 38, "score": 72.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3811], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19975, "user_id": 2334, "topic_id": 3712, "post_number": 4, "raw": "It's interesting that you want to create a new version of an existing system.\n\nTools shape the way you think, as the limits of the tools you have, defines the range of range of possible operations that you can do. \"When the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a thumb...\" :))\n\nAs with physical tools, mental tools are even more so, as their limits defines the limits of the possible frames-of-reference that you can conceptualise.\n\nWorking with the tarot requires working within the frame of reference that the tarot has at it's base.

If you put some glass fiber (ask the same people for scraps) on the cardboard honeycomb it becomes very strong (but only moderately so in compression).\n\nYou should not work where people live, and have good ventilation (wear glasses, gloves, read the fine print), but composites experience is very marketable, especially if you can work clean and precise.\n\nIs there magnetic stuff around (bed frames, parts of walls)? If yes you can buy a big batch of magnets (the strong ones are neodym) and use them to fix wall paper, fabric or similar. They can be pretty small and cheap and still get a lot done, also for improvised electronics.\n\nDo people use batteries a lot? Perhaps you can switch to rechargeable - with some help from Panasonic?

It is an explicit social contract, of the sort we imagine is hovering over the best community-care initiatives we have seen in the two years of opencare.  I find it very, very thought provoking; it seeks a way that we can promise to do our best, which is all that communities can do, while still taking responsibility. It somehow brings home the unwavering gaze at our human fallibility, our perennial underfunding, our precarious organisational structures, and still the excellence, still the empathy, still the grit to soldier on.\n\nReading made me think of the [Helliniko Metropolitan Community Clinic](https://edgeryders.eu/t/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care-system/4880), or of the [Woodbine Health Autonomy Center](https://edgeryders.eu/t/woodbine-health-autonomy-center/488), or of @alex_levene's and the other volunteers' work at [the Jungle in Calais](https://edgeryders.eu/t/care-on-the-camp-a-calais-story/503/4). \n\nI am sharing it here, hoping for comments from all of you \u2013 starting from @gehan, @woodbinehealth, @winnieponcelet and @patrick_andrews. In fact, I am thinking of making a non-care specific version that would cover all community initiatives. But then again, maybe all community initiatives have an element of care. \n\nA much longer, commented version is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lwi0tWuN6mjVwdbXBvlZXecpOXIA6sre95rEe_XnvD0/edit). \n\n### The contract\n\n1. This form of care is designed to outlive the individual initiators, and has a clear strategy towards sustainability, or the necessary situational awareness to navigate through changes preserving the right to care of its beneficiaries.\n\n2. This form of care is designed to work as a catalyzer, it may remain available an arbitrarily short period of time, and it is explicitly meant at raising awareness and/or teaching coping or problem solving strategies and/or passing the responsibility of care onto well identified existing organizations, rather than offering outright care in the traditional, entrusting sense.\n\n3. Care offered by our team/s is designed with you based on information that has been, and will be tested for validity concerning both its effectiveness and safety. Our partners and we commit to publicly discussing our practices, to be transparent and to have the opportunity of discovering what could be done better/differently.\n\n4. We commit to transparency about our funding streams, and we commit to procuring and managing resources adhering to the ethical standards we apply in all our activities, and in measure to sustain the continuity of our action, designing adequate fallback strategies should causes of _force majeure_ cut us short of planned funding.\n\n5. We have designed this initiative with our community in mind, we struggle to maintain space and opportunities for everyone of you to join us and use, or ethically misuse what we maintain, so that the forms and offers of care existing here could evolve with the community itself. We are aware we cannot do everything alone, but we can facilitate you doing your part.\n\n6. We put in place every measure within our means to support your conscious participation to the production of the desired outcomes, and to support you in behavior changing and maintenance. However, we will never deny your access to care from us, as long as fall within the community we care for, as it is transparently stated and advertised in our statute.\n\n7. We may enforce temporary restrictions to your access to care, under those circumstances in which your behavior represents an acute risk for the care providers (e.g.: violent or otherwise threatening behaviors), or whenever your behavior poses an absolute barrier to the achievement of the goal of said care, until modified (e.g.: requirement of discontinuation of alcohol abuse before accessing organs availability lists).\n\n8. We devote ourselves to care, and we are aware that the very objective and meaning of care evolve with the vision of the world of individuals and community. Thus, we commit to continuing independent evaluation of our activities, and to turning any breach or near miss consequently identified into the awareness of a changing landscape that would guide an evolution of our operations and governance. We invite all our members and users to raise a flag and report those instances in which needs required work-arounds, not because we aim to police the ethical dimension of your behavior, but because we want to rethink with you our rules and principles in order to find ways to accommodate the unmet needs you spotted in the most transparent and widely acceptable form possible.", "created_at": "2018-01-11 18:36:17.560785", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 00:32:14.496048", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 768, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 115.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3362], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41458, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7971, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hmmm.

But maybe there's some other way of support that works. I will look through the spreadsheet once per week (on mondays) and contact the people who entered a need that has not been crossed out yet and ask how it's going and encourage being bold, heroically needy and go for it. And ask what they need to dare asking someone (or another kind of support that I feel I'm capable of giving). The direct contact and organisation would still happen between the two parties, then.\n\nThen there's always the option of donors contacting people with needs directly - smooth version of getting around all the \"I'm ashamed to need something/use the sytem\" etc. bugs mentioned above, I hope. I will write the donors with \"open\" offerings a short encouragement mail on those mondays too.\n\nCheers to daring greatly!\n\nKaja\n\n", "created_at": "2016-01-29 17:28:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:25.273236", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 346, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41179, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7972, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I should mention that when economists talk about \"profit\" they mean profit _beyond the \"normal\" rate on return on capital_.

Vision builder & story teller. Designer, cynic, optimist. Loves vegan burgers & glowing things.\n----\nHi, I'm Arved. \n\nI grew up and live in Germany. When I was a child, I wanted to become an Inventor. I liked to build mechanisms and have all kinds of ideas. When I learned about carbon emissions I decided my first car will be an electric one. Now I'm 27, know about carsharing and the upcoming robotic cars, and don't think I'll ever own one. \n\nThe aforesaid Interests in having Ideas and creating led me to study **industrial design**. I finished the Bachelor with a coral science project and skills in process analysis, conception, crafting, prototyping and 3D-printing and various design techniques. I made a small [Website](http://arvedbuenning.de/en/) with these projects.\n\nRight now, apart from listening to many many of Science Fiction audiobooks, I'm involved in two startup-ish projects; \n-growing a vegan leather alternative through microorganisms \n-creating sense and jobs for homeless by co-creating and producing outdoor gear from industry leftovers.\n\nThese are examples of how I want to be a change agent for the transformation of society, towards sustainable ways of living. Others can be found in University. For learning how to do theses things better, I'm studying the **Transformation Design** Master at HBK Braunschweig. Whenever I feel like it, I make a [blog](http://www.coloursontheinside.com/) post about this. In the last two semesters I was mostly interested in two areas, and can give an example each;\n\n**co-creating shared visions for preferred futures**\nLast semester, I worked out a workshop method. It gives Civic Designers (here: everyone making decisions that affect a group of other people) an understanding of the stakeholders needs, wants and fears. It also sensitizes the stakeholders for their options and their role in choosing between them. \n\n**storytelling**\nIn the first Semester, we envisioned post-fossil mobility concepts for a rural region right next to the Volkswagen HQ & factorys. My Group ended up with a fake version of the large german news magazine DER SPIEGEL, dated 2050. This magazine tells the story of how the region transformed into a great example for all kinds of bicycle mobility, to which people from all over the world come to learn. It does this by showing (fake) blog articles and letters from inhabitants as well as telling in detail about various small projects we imagined. When we were at the region's parliament, we had one conservative stating the impossibility of our ideas, and several others from all different partys pronouncing their liking of thinking in visions instead of small day-to-day decisions. This was a great experience, and maybe more things will come that way. \n\nBut I can't wait. \n\nThis Semester now, I and two other students cooperate with someone who bought an old lime plant and wants to transform it to a center for traditional crafts, permaculture, transdisciplinary projects and general happiness. He's working on this for years, and we'd like to boost this by creating some kind of event to grow the community. At the moment, we are working on a concept for the event and its communication. \n\nthis leads me to the last point; **why I am here**\n\nI'm not only looking for Inspiration for the current project, I'd love to become part of a network of like-minded-professionals. Also, as the end of my studies approaches, I'm trying to find out where I can do all these things I love and make a living from it, without selling my soul.

The original idea to initiate OpenVillage House Kathmandu was to form a common welcoming place to bring people together by creating a co-working / co-housing space along with a coffee roastery. \n\n**Progress Made in Planning**\n\nAfter our discussion here, @matthias and I began to prepare budgets and also decided on location to start the roastery. Kathmandu is a crowded city \u2026 as being capital of the country, it is densely populated (capitals are always crowded I guess :grinning:). Not being much of city person myself, I really want the location of OpenVillage House Kathmandu to be little free from chaos and traffic, away from main city area. I began to see a few houses away from the main city with possibilities of having OpenVillage House Kathmandu there. Which helped us to get more information about rents and facilities. In the process of location hunt, we were invited by wonderful @shei who owns a beautiful travelers hostel [Cora Nepal](http://www.coranepal.com).They wanted to sublease the ground floor of the building to next tenant. I  went to see if the space itself will be suitable to start roastery. [Cora Nepal](http://www.coranepal.com) is situated in Sanepa (one of the nicest location of town) and has a beautiful lawn in the backyard.\n\n[Cora Nepal ](http://www.coranepal.com) has comfort with artistic decor, created by wonderful people like @shei and Sid who are operating the house. But sadly the space available in Cora Nepal and the budget we had allocated for rent did not match so we had to let go the space. Rent in Kathmandu is expensive and for startups like us, the most challenging part is sustainability. We need to make sure that we do not lose the place until the space itself starts to create some sort of profit to keep itself running.\n\n**Twisted Crazy Turn :sweat_smile:**\n\nDuring the planning phase I took a quick escape from Kathmandu and went to the nearby city \u201cHetauda\u201d . Hetauda (Nepali: \u0939\u0947\u091f\u094c\u0921\u093e) is a sub-metropolitan city in southern Nepal. It is the administrative headquarters of the Makwanpur District, the headquarters of Nepal's Central Development Region, and one of the largest cities of Nepal. It is often famously regarded as \u201cGreen City\u201d because the city has planted trees on either sides of the road and is the pioneer city in the plantation of the trees. \n\nHetauda city is located at a distance of 76 km from the capital city, Kathmandu, via the fast track, at a distance of 132 km via Daman Tribhuvan Highway and 224 km via Narayanghat. Another highway (\"Kanti Lokpath\") will be built until May 2018 and then it will take only 2 hours to travel from Hetauda to Kathmandu.\n\nThere are many interesting cities in Nepal which are underrated but have almost all basic facilities that Kathmandu can provide. In my three days stay in Hetauda, I found Hetauda city very interesting and it bears quite good potential in terms of starting an OpenVillage House. So far, most of the interesting things happen only inside Kathmandu. So why not set up our OpenVillage House at Hetauda? It has nature and quite a calming environment, along with the basic facilities we need to operate our OpenVillage House. I am very excited to share that I now have planned to set up an OpenVillage House in Hetauda, making it **OPEN VILLAGE HOUSE HETAUDA** from now on. I will be travelling to Hetauda to see some of the suitable properties and decide on location on 21st January and will update here on what I found  :slight_smile:\n\n**Progress on the Roastery**\n\nIn terms of coffee roaster machines, @matthias  and I have decided to see if we can bring a coffee roaster machine from India \u2013 see the first two machines from the list of [Designing an open source coffee roaster](/t/id/7677). I have sent a couple of emails to the sellers but have not got replies yet. But luckily I happen to know a friend from India and he is now helping us on assisting the machine inquiry.\n\nWe are also finding an appropriate name for the roastery, as the rostery will be a separate entity but operated under OpenVillage House Hetauda. We are still searching a name for it. Any suggestions for names are welcome :slight_smile: \n\nSo far we have got \u201cNAMAS COFFEE\u201d as our brand name. \"Namaste\" or \"namaskar\" is used as a respectful form of greeting, acknowledging and welcoming a relative, guest or stranger.  This gesture is widely used throughout India, Nepal, Bangladesh and other parts of Asia.\n\nSending best wishes to everyone for OpenVillage Academy happening in Morocco :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2018-01-17 04:54:10.479966", "updated_at": "2018-01-17 13:05:44.562331", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 822, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 1395.0, "like_count": 8, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 1935, 4, 4265, 3811, 3904, 3, 3782], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22798, "user_id": 119, "topic_id": 5236, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Wow.

Great you guys are on the move. \n\nCurious: have you scoped out the possible market for coffee in Hetauda? Roasteries in Europe make their money in two ways:\n\n1. They sell coffee to other businesses (hotels, restaurants) and consumers through some kind of distribution chain. \n1. They run in-house caf\u00e9s where they sell _prepared_ coffee to people who like to hang out there.  \n\nThe second stream of revenue is far and away the most stable. Organic, open source etc. latch nicely onto the \"coffee culture\" that comes from America and Australia. They hype it, of course: they even sell courses to learn how to roast and make coffee. They are quite successful. In Brussels recently a new local chain (I think they have 5 shopfronts now) called [Or](https://orcoffee.be/en) became all the rage. I tried to get Matt to visit them, but I think he did not go in the end :slight_smile:\n\nAnyway, this kind of stuff, here, is mostly an urban experience. The kind of person that shows up with a laptop, sits down and drinks coffee at 3 EUR the cup tends to gravitate to large, vibrant cities.

Kate Raworth Holds a BA In Politics, Philosophy and Economics and an MSc in Economics for Development from Oxford. Now she is at Oxfam. Her specialty is not economics as such, but what different kind of economics would be able to produce the kind of world she envisions. She has written an Oxfam discussion paper \u201cA Safe and Just Space for Humanity\u201d. The \u201cdoughnut\u201d is the space between providing the needs that human beings consider minimal to ensure they get a roof over their heads and food on the table, health care, etc. and the proposed maximum drain on Earth\u2019s resources by human beings. The thing about this is that all these boundaries must be set by someone. Unlike with market capitalism, boundaries are in this scheme not set by the aggregate freely made decisions of households. It is unlikely that they will be set by poor people in developing countries \u2014 they have little power. It seems that Ms Raworth intends that they be set by people with her views and education \u2014 Western liberal development and ecological economics experts. But there is no way to ensure that this would be possible, even if it were agreed that this group is an acceptable decision-maker did the rest of the world, which is by no means certain. So realistically it is a talking-piece about what kind of economic controls this group advocates to enable its vision to be realized. As a pure proposal by a self-realized and self-accepted limited group with this set of characteristics (Western-educated liberal development professionals) it is a useful contribution; it is when those who propose it consider that their group should make decisions for everyone that it seems to me we should pause. Poor people in developing countries often have the uncomfortable characteristic of not agreeing with what such experts think is best for them and the planet.

This happens because the economy is a system interlocked with other systems (like climate), and too much growth would destabilize these other systems.

It has the potential to bring about a lasting impact (to different degrees) if promoted through-out a consistent value chain. It is a holistic approach that gained substantial interest from several institutions. Also, it contributes to changing mindsets in general and where widely adopted, perhaps even until it becomes a norm.\n\nI am not involved in any of these initiatives but broadly interested in the potentials of extended value chains, in particular, the role and difference ethics can make in developing societies at large. I am not actively working with this. However, I will start a simple blog, called the \u201cvalue of ethics\u201d \u2013 just for fun, more like a hobby and something I have had in mind for some time now. It will be very basic. Eventually, it would be great to work further with these ideas.\n\nRelationships have a significant role in the outcome. Rooted in interactions between people, I share that ethics has immeasurable value to society and communities at large. One strategy of working might be more efficient than another, but I think that EdgeRyders is making that difference distinctly through immediate community work. On the other side, co-existence means that various types of stakeholders will ultimately play a role in reducing gaps and determining the paths for relations, be it economics, environment, technology... In general, governments, industry, private-public partnerships, etc. are pivotal contributors to this process: where stakeholders impact in different ways.\n\nThe role that various stakeholders take in shaping our society can be considered ground up, a collaboration that perpetually accommodates sustainable outcomes.  Hence, an ambition to do something around the concept and value of ethics for communities, but these are just thoughts.

But for every paragraph I found about the human scale, I found pages about infrastructural impact studies. Taking for example the Atkins Global analyse about the cities of the future we get an inside at how designers, architects and engineers want to sculpt the city. But in which way do you give the choice toward the inhabitants to learn how to better a city.\nWithout sounding clich\u00e9, I believe in human centred design to better the liveability of future cities. Before presenting my thesis, we need to accept two premises:\n\n* Cities in general go toward a higher urban density\n* smaller private living spaces becoming the norm in cities\n\nIf we accept this reality, we should understand that people will be living much closer to each other while having to share smaller public space. This is why we see such an evolution on how city planners look at the space cars take, and are changing the paradigm. But what if this wasn\u2019t enough? Denser space means more chances for friction, but also in the long term better liveability. So how do we shrink the gap towards better liveability without creating bigger economical gabs, also known as gentrification? What do we have to teach city-residents so a city creates good living conditions without throwing out the lesser fortunate.\n\nThe Brussels Case\n\nI\u2019m taking Brussels as the example, because I lived there for my whole live, counting twenty-nine winters at the moment, and know her biggest challenges and history on an urbanistic level. \nAt the moment there is an interesting debate going on through the means of Le Soir. Let's call it #Bruxellespageblanche. The latest entry from Eric Corijn is the one that goes towards the story i want to contribute too. It\u2019s about finally opening up the unthinkable: redistributing the localities into districts that are geographically, anthropologically and socially logical that are for the good of the region and its inhabitants that is Brussels.  \nThe partial solution I want to present consists of two premises that together forms a factor to consider when (re)designing future, high density city districts.\n\n-          How the commons can help transiting towards a smaller economical gap\n-          Anonymousness as a factor of negative perception of the city\n\nAt the moment we are designing new areas often as single use spaces. We follow the rule of scarcity: when a city becomes denser, the space becomes more scarce, so the price will go up. We each fight for our personal space, and listen to the market or geolocal politics. You want your living space, your working space and your shopping space, but because of that you play along the classical market.\n \nWhat if we shift from a scarcity model towards an model of abundance (like presented by the P2P foundation). We are starting to discover the benefits of open source knowledge and are opening up towards a sharing knowledge base through all kinds of different tools. We even have truly sharing economy initiatives like Tournevie or the crowdfunding platform Growfunding. Through this kind of initiatives we are developing a first grasp of what abundancy can be. But what if we infused these principles into legislation? Making abundancy a building block of the city of the future. Projects that work under collaborative principes, lowering their costs and environmental impact by cooperating and not compete with one another should be at the center of this new Brussels DNA. \n\nCreating cooperatives dived over the different districts, where you could plug in into local actor when starting up projects should be the norm. It cost less energy to better existing project than to start everything on your own. It also cost less money, and that at the moment is not well balanced out at all in Brussels. We want to build a better Brussels, we only can do it if we learn to collaborate and break the invisible barriers created by the institutions. \n\nBut how do we get there? We are lacking one important skill to create this mutual, collaborative machine for Brussels futur: a trust membrane that builds up an easier way to read through the complex layers of human and organisation egos that are filled with good intentions but sometimes don\u2019t want to work together because of lack of trust, or a badly build up relationship. If we want truly a #bruxellescarteblanche we need to look at the humain level too. Because after all we all have our egos, we all have our flaws. \n\nThat\u2019s where i think anonymousness plays a significant role. If we want a thriving collaborative city, we need a city that is build on a human scale, and we need to invite people to meet each other more. Let\u2019s throw those city marketing events out of the equation, let\u2019s not continue to make the historic city center a disneyland for weekend tourist. But put local shops, cultural houses and social organisations at the center of this \u2018de-anonymousness\u2019. Creating much more connections with each other because even if we don\u2019t want to, we will be forced to use the same space if we take my two first premises in consideration. \n\nLet\u2019s round this up and make it a bit political, since it is a election year. If we want to see a real change in Brussels, and this #bruxellescarteblanche is a great start, we need to reboot not only the way we build institutional infrastructures, but also how we create human interactions. \n\nFor me it is import to look into common based principles as a puzzle piece of the new toolbox. If we understand that abundance is a realistic way of creating solutions for the city, we can start getting around the drawing board. If we want that this drawing board doesn't become a mess we need to train our collaborative skills by having much more shared experience. \n\nAt this moment i didn\u2019t hear one program in the Brussels political scene opening up this debate, every single party thinks having all the pieces of the puzzle in their hand. We have 9 months to show them new possible puzzle pieces, let\u2019s continue this debate!\n\n**P.S:** all the links can be found [here](https://medium.com/@yannickS/from-scare-city-towards-abundance-bruxellescarteblanche-323e9691d434)\n\nMaybe it could be cool to have the possibility when copying a text, that the embedded links are taken with.

After we have passed together our first exam, we discovered that we are able to work together in a super-effective way, thanks to our capability to mix our professionalisms, abilities and passions. When one of us needs help, the other one supports her and viceversa, in any kind of situation (even shopping matters!).\n\nLast year, in order to realize a real prototype for the Innovation Studio course, we got in contact, for the first time, with WeMake and @Costantino, who helped us to realize it. Some months later, Costantino \u00a0asked us to join him at the <a href=\"http://www.iban.it/it/3021\">GEC 2015 - Global Entrepreneurship Congress</a>, collaborating with Maker Faire and Garanzia Giovani. It was a great experience! We organized and designed the elements for the Maker Faire\u2019s stand. Moreover, during those days we met a lot of people and we discovered new materials, technologies and projects.\n\nThis winter, after concluding all our master exams, Costantino\u00a0offered us to be involved in OpenCare as Service Designers. We obviously accepted and jumped in it! Currently, we are working for OpenCare as interns (two months and two months, from March to May), but we strongly hope to continue this collaboration with WeMake.\n\nWe think that OpenCare is a great opportunity for us and both for our expertises and capabilities, since it is totally linked with our studies and passions.\n\nWell, thank you for reading our little story :) let us know if you have any further questions.\n\nHave nice day!\n\nSilvia and @ChiaraFrr\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-20 13:21:42", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 07:38:00.291498", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 373, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87786, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 13179, "post_number": 14, "raw": "@nadia, do I still have access to Canva?

Ok, I am exploited, but in a stable way. This is almost a privilege today. What about permanently unemployed. What about precarious workers? What about all those living outside of our cupola, our universe? So the only agency of possible change I think can rise with the combination of all these dispossessed, marginalised and so on. Illegal immigrant workers, permanently unemployed, those living under ecological threat, the task is to somehow join all these multiple points.
