We take a health issue like histamine intolerance as a concrete example for which it is clear and mandatory that food intake and lifestyle are determining the severity of the health condition. In defining \u201cCare\u201d I would like to work around the question: Is our diet and lifestyle shaped around products or can we brake out of this path and empower ourselves in designing products - an app in this case - that help us define which food and lifestyle combination is better for each unique person?

During the last day on the 26th we're planning an unConference.\n\nEarlier on 21-22 there will be a hackathon (see below).\n\n### How much does it cost?\n\nYou can't just buy a ticket to LOTE4 \u2013 but it is not a free event, either. LOTE4 admits no spectators: you can only come as part of the team. This means you pay for your ticket in collaboration, instead of in money. You could be a speaker, a volunteer or part of our communication team: we will find together something you are good at and LOTE4 needs. [Find out about LOTE4 teams](/t/lote4-dashboard/3113).  \n\n### UPDATE: Are you late? Last minute registration\n\nLet us know you are coming by either 1. [commenting on a session](/t/lote4-the-program/3589) that you like or 2. saying you're coming on [this facebook event.](https://www.facebook.com/events/900323349996181/) We'll be in touch right away!\n\n### How can I make myself useful now that I'm coming?\n\n* You can still [propose a session](/t/sessions-at-lote4-the-stewardship/590), as the agenda is in the making still, and after mid October when it will be done, your session will still be able to take place during the much more informal unConference.\n\n* You can [sign up to the social media team](/task-3553) and help build the buzz ahead, during and after the event.\n\n* If you simply show up at Lote4 without having contributed in advance, our unMonastery House team will surely have tasks for everyone! Consider registering to [help plan food.](/t/join-the-foodies-at-lote4/3729)\n\n### What is stewardship?\n\nStewardship is the act of taking care, preserving, maintaining. We mean it in the sense that communities \u2013 starting with us \u2013 need to become better at being stewards of public goods. ([learn more](/t/why-we-care-about-stewardship/3460)).\n\n### Who are the LOTE4 heroes?\n\nThe people who have chosen to act, each contributing to finding and testing ways for improvement in the face of multiple global crises (environmental, economic, social, political). It is the individuals and groups who are working on all fronts of radical social innovation, from open source everything to small batch manufacturing, from urban agriculture to moneyless economies. Programmers, designers, innovators, hacktivists, artists, scientists, policymakers, nurturers, entrepreneurs, thinkers, netizens, and activists. \\#LOTE4 is where we come together, compare notes, share skills, experiences and encouragement.\n\n### Who is organising LOTE4?\n\nLote4 is organised by the Edgeryders community coordinated by Nadia EL-Imam and Ben Vickers, with project management support from Noemi Salantiu and James Lewis, communications support from Said Hamideh, practical support from Edgeryders LBG and intellectual support from: Alberto Cottica, Amelia Andersdotter, Annemarie Naylor, David De Ugarte, Fabrizio Barca, Riel Miller, Giulio Quaggiotto and Vinay Gupta.\n\n### Who should I contact?\n\nWrite to noemi [at] edgeryders.eu or alberto[at] edgeryders.eu if you\u2019ve got questions.The physical address is: **unMonastery**, Complesso del Casale, Via Madonna delle Virt\u00f9, Rioni Sassi (Sasso Barisano), 75100 Matera, Italy. The unMonastery also hosts a production office proudly (wo)manned by @Natalia_Skoczylas. If you are in town, go see her, or call her 0039 331 503 58 00.\n\n### Is LOTE4 a professional event?\n\nYes, and no. Former participants will hopefully say that it was a good professional experience they got at the event, but LOTE4 isn\u2019t run by a professional events organization. It's done by peers, for peers. We drew inspiration from Reboot, a community event which in many ways was foundational for the Edgeryders and LOTE4 story (Thank you Thomas &lt :heart_decoration: .\n\nThe Stewardship is the fourth LOTE, after Strasbourg and Brussels. It takes place in the unMonastery, one of many projects to emerge from the community. We chose it because it is a spectacular place, and because the experience of setting it up and running it is relevant to this year's [theme](/t/why-we-care-about-stewardship/3460).\n\n### About unMonastery House Rules\n\nThe unMonastery is much more than our conference venue, it is a space with a meaningful recent history where 14 community members used to live and work in the spring of 2014. It's also equipped with bedrooms, bathrooms and a kitchen.\n\nOur hosts: unMonasterians, although not in full formation, will be there 24/24, and offered to take on the responsibility of keeping the space clean, safe and friendly, reproducing at least part of the house habits and internal \u201crules\u201d. House rules will be posted, unMonasterians will be easily identifiable and there to answer any questions about the unMonastery and the building. Some of their established customs, such as Zero Waste, opening and closing circles, morning practice, sharing meals, etc. will continue throughout LOTE. Most of these are open to everyone to join - but we should ask first and try not to impose. The building closes after closing circles (around 11pm) as the morning bell rings at 7am. [more about expectations](/t/lote4-countdown-2-organising-our-stay-in-matera-and-expectations/3720)\n\n### Can you help me organize my trip to Matera?\n\nSure! Check out the [travel information](/t/travel-info/3277). \n\n### Is there travel support available?\n\nWe have roughly a dozen travel grants available and we've been [awarding](/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359/lote4-countdown-1-more-edgeryders-coming-to-matera-more-travel) them to community members and participants involved in preparing the event. Coming October the list might be full, but get in touch with @Noemi at noemi[at]edgeryders[dot]eu if you really need support.\n\n### Where do I sleep while at \\#lote4?\n\nEven with the grants made available, we can't take responsibility for organising any aspect of your trip to Matera. You will have to book for yourself. Check out the [planning wiki](/t/plan-your-lote4-travel-and-accommodation/3351) and hook up with fellow Edgeryders to share an apartment.\n\n### What about the unMonastery? Can't I sleep there?\n\nNot unless you have been invited to or agreed in advance with @Bembo_Davies. Unlike last year\u2019s Lote, the space is a core supporting pillar of the conference with its own infrastructure and house norms, rather than surrogate accommodation. Let's think of ourselves as guests.\n\n### What do I eat at \\#lote4?\n\nFood is on us, at least breakfast and lunch, while every evening community meals will be cooked and served at the unMonastery or in a nearby neighborhood (nomadic dinners). Check out what we have planned and volunteer for a task (clearning, shopping, cooking..).\n\n### Where does it all go?\n\nLOTE events and the Edgeryders online platform are meeting places for the Edgeryders community. The community exists so that we can support each other as we develop creative solutions in response to systemic crises. The [unMonastery](/t/unmonastery/315), the [Makerfox](/makerfox), the [Viral Academy](/viral-academy) and several other projects were birthed at previous LOTE events. These took place in Strasbourg, France (2012), Brussels, Belgium (2012) and Matera, Italy (2013).\n\n## FAQs about the Hackathon\n\n### Why is this a valuable experience?\n\nIt is an opportunity to look up and do the kind of open thinking with others that is very generative. It results in building interest and mass around existing and new initiatives or ideas. It also ensures work gets done on things that would improve projects and programs, but requires collaborative effort outside day to day operations.\n\n### What is unique about what we are offering? \n\nA new hackathon format designed for people running great projects who could use some help, are stretched thin for time/money and have valuable skills/experience to offer others. \n\n### What will come out of it?\n\nConcrete improvements of exitising projects and new projects developed through collaboration between participants.\n\n### Open to what kinds of projects? \n\nProjects that are relevant to this year's theme: [Community Stewardship](/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359-program).\n\n### Who will be participating? \n\nLOTE will be bringing together an unusual mix of people who build things with their own hands and state level actors, so you get access both to the grassroots experiencers and skills, and the perspectives of stakeholders whom you are likely to interact with/ affect your work on some level.\n\n### The process will be...\n\nopen source, happen mainly online, and require your active participation. If your project is selected for one of the six slots in the hackathon program, you are also required to participate in the physical event in Matera, on October 20-22.\n\n### I love this approach! How can I support any particular project or the process as a whole?\n\nYou can [join a team](/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359-dashboard) to help build the event. If you don't see something that fits, or if you would like to explore different [options for partnerships](/partnership-opportunities) write to nadia@edgeryders.eu.\n\n[Join us](/t/registration/3274) on October 23-26th in Matera, Italy, for the Stewardship: [https://edgeryders.eu/registration-0](/t/registration/3274)\n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/82554988?portrait=0\n\n----------\n\n## :de: **_German version_** <a name=\"de\"></a>\n\n## H\u00e4ufige Fragen \u00fcber LOTE4\n\n### Was ist das hier?\n\nLiving on the Edge ist eine Community-Veranstaltung mit einem Fokus auf gesellschaftlichen Wandel und Technologie.\n\nLiving On The Edge (LOTE) ist ein internationales Meeting f\u00fcr praxis-orientierte Vision\u00e4re, die in einer Welt konfrontiert mit wirtschaftlichen, sozialen, \u00f6kologischen und politischen Krisen, Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt an der Gestaltung und Organisation unserer Zukunft arbeiten und daf\u00fcr neue Modelle benutzen.\n\nLOTE ist ein Ort f\u00fcr Menschen, um einmal im Jahr zusammen kommen und ihren Verstand mit Perspektive, neue Kenntnissen und Beziehungen zu bereichern. Was 2011 als Veranstaltung mit einem europ\u00e4ischen Fokus startete, wurde im Laufe der Jahre immer internationaler. \n\n### Wer sind die LOTE Helden?\n\nDie Menschen, die sich entschieden haben zu handeln und damit zur tats\u00e4chlichen Verbesserung unserer Lebensumst\u00e4nde in einer Zeit von verschiedenen globalen Krisen (\u00f6kologisch, \u00f6konomisch, sozial, politisch) beitragen.

Noemi Salantiu leitet das Projekt-Management an und James Lewis hilft bei der Kommunikation. Said Hamideh leistet praktische Unterst\u00fctzung von Edgeryders LBG und Alberto Cottica, Amelia Andersdotter, Annemarie Naylor, David De Ugarte, Fabrizio Barca, Riel Miller, Giulio Quaggiotto und Vinay Gupta unterst\u00fctzen die Organisation intellektuell.\n\n### Wen soll ich kontaktieren?\n\nWenn Du Fragen hast schreib an nadia [at] edgeryders.eu oder ben[at] unmonastery.eu.

Es findet im unMonastery statt, einem von vielen Projekten, das aus der Edgeryders Gemeinschaft entstanden ist. Wir haben es ausgew\u00e4hlt, weil weil es ein spektakul\u00e4rer Ort ist und weil die Erfahrungen, die wir w\u00e4hrend des unMonastery Aufbaus gesammelt haben relevant f\u00fcr das diesj\u00e4hrige [thema ](#)sind.\n\n### Wie viel kostet es?\n\nBei LOTE4 gibt es keine Zuschauer: Man kann nur als Beteiligte/r kommen. Das bedeutet, dass das Ticket mit Kooperation und Zusammenarbeit anstatt mit Geld bezahlt wird. Du kannst Vortragende/r, ehrenamtliche/r Mitarbeiter/in oder Teil unseres Kommunikationsteams sein: wir finden gemeinsam etwas, das DU gut kannst und das gleichzeitig wichtig f\u00fcr LOTE4 ist.[Informier Dich \u00fcber die LOTE4 Teams ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/lote4-registration/3274)\n\n### K\u00f6nnt ihr mir helfen, meine Reise nach Matera zu organisieren?\n\nKlar! Schau Dir die [Reises info](https://edgeryders.eu/t/lote4-travel-info-arabic/3277) an. \n\n### Wohin soll die Reise gehen?\n\nWir veranstalten LOTE4, zusammen mit der Online-Plattform Edgeryders als Online-Offline-Infrastruktur, um in Reaktion auf systemische Krisen dringend ben\u00f6tigte, kreative L\u00f6sungen zu unterst\u00fctzen. The unMonastery, the Makerfox, the Viral Academy and several other projects were birthed at previous LOTE events.  unMonastery,  Makerfox, die Viral-Akademie und mehrere andere Projekte wurden bei fr\u00fcheren LOTE Veranstaltungen ins Leben geruf.\n\n## H\u00e4ufige Fragen \u00fcber den Hackathon\n\n### Warum ist es eine wertvolle Erfahrung?\n\nEs ist eine Gelegenheit, um von der eigenen Arbeit aufzuschauen und sich auf ein offenes, generatives Denken mit anderen einzulassen. Das wiederum f\u00fchrt zum Aufbau von gemeinsamen Interessen im Bezug auf existierende oder neue Ideen und Initiativen. Es stellt sicher, das die Arbeit, die unsere OPrjekte und Programme verbessert, wirklich getan wird. Aber es erfordert auch eine gemeinsame Anstrengung au\u00dferhalb des Tagesgesch\u00e4fts.\n\n### Was macht unser Angebot einzigartig?\n\nEin neues Hackathon Format, das Leute hilft, die tolle Projekte machen, zus\u00e4tzliche finanzielle und zeitliche Ressourcen ben\u00f6tigen und im Gegenzug wertvolle F\u00e4higkeiten und Erfahrungen zu bieten haben. \n\n### Was wird dabei herauskommen?\n\nKonkrete Verbesserungen von existierenden Projekten und neue Projekte, die durch die Kooperation der Teilnehmer entwickelt wurden.\n\n### Open to what kinds of projects?\n\nProjekte, die relvant f\u00fcr das diesj\u00e4hrige Thema sind: [Community Stewardship.]()\n\n### Wer wird teilnehmen?\n\n_\"LOTE will be bringing together an unusual mix of people who build things with their own hands and state level actors, so you get access both to the grassroots experiencers and skills, and the perspectives of stakeholders whom you are likely to interact with/ affect your work on some level.\"_\n\n### Der Prozess wird...\n\nopen source sein, haups\u00e4chlich online stattfinden und Deine aktive Teilnahme ben\u00f6tigen.

Obviously I needed some sleep :D\n\nSo, what to put into the sidebar. I'm not sure listing the annotations there is what we need at all, since the main page already contains the same information. Some initial Ideas that come to mind of what could be meaningful in the sidebar:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Export button.</strong> A button to export all own annotations. Together with a fields to select which groups to include (<a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/issues/20\">issue \\#20</a>) and an upload field to allow updating an existing RQDA file (<a href=\"https://github.com/edgeryders/openethnographer/issues/19\">issue \\#19</a>) this could be its own tab in the sidebar. The export button itself is for now\u00a0<a href=\"/en/annotation/export\">just a link</a>, so it's simple to include.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Choosing which tags to show.</strong> By default, annotations with any tag would be shown in the text (or maybe only with any own tag). In the sidebar, a user change this. There could be a list of own tags, and below it a list of others' public tags, each with a checkbox to show or hide the corresponding annotations. In both lists, tags that appear in the current text would come first and be printed in bold. But the list would contain all tags whatsoever, and the selection made here would apply to any node visited until changed in the sidebar again.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Forking tags.</strong> Forking a tag is a tag-level operation, so is best placed alongside the show/hide tag-level operation in its own column, rather than into individual annotations.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Collaboration tab.</strong> Strictly, both forking and this tab are about collaboration, but while forking is about \"branching off\", this tab would be about \"raking in\" others' additions and changes, incorporating them in ones own work where relevant. It could for example be a list of \"annotations you have not seen\", showing all new public annotations added by other researchers to nodes / comments oneself has also commented on, if created after one has last worked on the specific node or comment. The researcher can then walk through this list and mark items as \"read\", after acting on it for example by forking a newly created tag, adding an annotation with an existing or new own tag, adding a comment, or doing nothing at all.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Coding progress manager.</strong> One tab of the sidebar could contain an ethnographer's \"to-do list\": the nodes and comments she wants to code for the job at hand, and an overview of the nodes and comments she has coded already.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Quotation manager.</strong> When clicking a tag in an annotation bubble, the sidebar would open and show a list of nodes (and snippets for each) where the same tag is currently used. However, the sidebar might provide too little space for this. The currently planned for alternative is to use the Drupal taxonomy term pages for this purpose.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Update:</strong> Added the \"Collaboration tab\" idea.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-17 16:15:00", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:42.652188", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 540, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8808], "is_liked_by": [1450], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24134, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2489, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Thanks Inge,</b>\n\nGeorgian is pretty cool, I need to learn a bit!

I guess that means more ways to fail, but I'm still optimistic. Many people will say that what I want is 'just a pipe dream', 'it's too ambitious', 'it will never work'. But I keep asking myself: 'Why can't we do this? What's stopping us?', and I don't find any good reasons. I can imagine a ton of ways it could go wrong, sure, but I think we're smart enough to anticipate and deal with everything. At least we're smart enough to think we have a good chance, and that it's worth a shot.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI'm in the UK. No plans to visit Matera at the moment, but who knows. If you'd like to VOIP chat any time, no doubt that would be useful for me. But I'm also happy with text. (a combination is good).\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"I believe the only way this can possibly work is with real asset transfer of property to the community,\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nI guess that would be ideal. Is it really so hard to set up? On the other hand, I come from more of an anarchist background. If I trust the person that owns the land, and they give their word that they're in it for the long term, then I'd be happy with that.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"mainstream institutions have seen many projects fail - who's to say ours won't?\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nInterestingly I think we are immune to a lot of weaknesses that conventional organisations have. The reason I'm optimistic is because we're so different from anything 'mainstream'. People will 'work' for us because they care. They'll be doing what they love with people they love for people they love. So we avoid a ton of problems like 'profit motive'.. workers feeling disenfranchised, etc. To see it working in the real world look at Mondragon (http://bwcd.vdcn.org/bluemars.html , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zMvktpKDmo).\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"The point at which you own the land, is the point at which the weight of responsibility multiplies, significantly\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhy? I feel we have a massive responsibility to do good, that dwarfs anything else. Owning land is pretty meaningless to me (properly is theft, we are all stewards of spaceship earth, blah blah). Owning is just convenient cos certain groups with power think it's important. If I could squat and get away with it without the state bothering me, I would.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Money, in my experience everything breaks when money gets involved\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut why should it? You think if we became rich we'd become corrupt and stop caring about helping people? I don't think we would. Money is also pretty meaningless to me, just a means to an end. I have no desire for anything lavish. The only things that can make me happy are good friends, basic food/shelter, and time to study.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI don't think there is any reason money should go hand in hand with \"shareholder influence\". Obviously if evil, greedy people have any power in your group, then bad things are likely to happen. But the problem here is evil greedy people, not money. Money is just a convenient way to swap power and get things done. I guess it can tempt bad things, and long term we will probably get rid of it (replace with reputations/energy/gift economy, or whatever). But short term, I see no reason why we can't use it to get the things we want.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"unMonastery for me is not a utopian project designed to solve the woes of the world, it operates at the scale of the invention of the fire hydrant, it's designed to put out fires in the present moment, so that others can begin to build foundations and infrastructure for doing the next bit\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nRight. unMonastery is really cool, and it's a good step, but I keep asking myself 'why should we limit our ambitions?'. If I thought we had no chance of fixing everything, I'd probably focus on something smaller, and say 'oh well, every little helps'. But I think we do have a chance to do something massive. So why not shoot for it?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-04 16:09:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.564589", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 952, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22710], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26105, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 3946, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>hangout now :)</b>\n\nhi\n\nme and Dan are here waiting for everyone to join,\n\nshould we join the community call hangout ?\n\nwe are there :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-04 10:05:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:24.768227", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 36, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8053, "user_id": 105, "topic_id": 3992, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Edgeryders hosting documentation?</b>\n\n<a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>,\u00a0looking at\u00a0https://edgeryders.eu/en/edgeryders-dev wikis, I didn't notice one describing current hosting setup.

Do we really want people working with machines to be recognized and paid better than those working with people?\n\nTo illustrate the unfair distribution of this work: 80% of care work is done by women, professionally and even more privately: 80%. That\u2019s why the Equal Care Day will occur only every four years, as a reminder that, in Germany, men would take four years to equal the care work performed by women in a single year.\n\n<h4>Care work isn\u2019t a private matter.</h4>\n\nIt\u2019s not an individual decision, but something that affects and calls for all of us. At best, we defer the problem by paying through outsourcing. The effects of this uneven distribution especially affect men, not only morally, because they give up most of their duties and responsibilities, but also personally. After retiring, a lot of men regret not having saved more time to spend with their children, their families This is especially significant given mens\u2019 shorter life expectancy (5 years, on average) as compared to women \u2013 one of the reasons for that is that they\u2019re less careful with their own bodies (unhealthy diet, belated reaction to/ignorance of symptoms, risky behavior, higher use of drugs, higher risk of suicide), maybe not individually, but statistically.\n\n<h3>P.S. PayGap and CareGap already exists in childrens's rooms</h3>\n\nThe imbalance starts out from children\u2019s rooms, not just because the adult world conveys narrow role models \u2013 but also because children themselves experience the CareGap as well as the PayGap: In average, boys\u2019 allowances are higher than girls\u2019 and girls are expected to help with housework and look after younger siblings a lot more than boys. We pass on a mix of sexism, racism and classism to the next Generation in a very subtle way.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-19 13:35:20", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 11:37:26.990322", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 359, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14849, "user_id": 52, "topic_id": 1315, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>full movie</b>\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WutkXulcwk\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-23 09:16:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:23.658735", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10515, "user_id": 2, "topic_id": 1635, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Ben's summary</b>\n\nThank you, Ben, for such an honest reflection of your experience.\n\nI, too, felt as if I had 'found a tribe' and experienced a huge surge of optimism in the face of a renewed and more urgent understanding of how much trouble we are in....\n\nWell done...\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-23 21:55:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:00.382188", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 58, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21744, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 6271, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Ouch!\n\nThis wins the award for bleakest B-word take i've read this weak.\n\n\"Meanwhile, of course, I have studiously avoided the implications of the B-word.

For those of you who don't know me, I'm Open Care's ethnographer --- I have been reading everyone's stories, growing increasingly more inspired, and making sure that the important connections you all are making do not get lost. A lot of the time, ethnographers consider themselves to be research instruments -- so maybe think of me as another technology, like the platform itself or the cool visualisations the research team has been producing :)\n\nBut it has become increasingly difficult for me to feel I am fulfilliing my role as an ethnographer, because one of the central tenets of ethnographic practice is participant-observation. Now, I've certainly done plenty of observing. But I think I have been dropping the ball slightly on the participant part! Talking about my own positionality is important to making sure that I am filtering everyone else's through lenses that don't distort them.\n\nSo here's one of my Open Care stories.\n\nI have two related questions: how do we care for people in our communities who aren't visibly ill, yet whose lives are made more difficult by invisible illnesses keeping them from living life the way they want to? And how can we look outside current medical frameworks to help people whose illnesses haven't been successfully helped by existing medical frameworks? This issue of invisible illness particularly affects labor, which as many of you have noted, is both a crucial part of what it means to be human (working on things that enrich us, feeling like we have autonomy and are masters of our own destiny) but also something that can cause us pain (when we have to do jobs we don't like, or can't find employment in this rapidly changing world).\n\nThese questions hit particularly close to home for me. I suffer from vestibular migraines (also called migraine-associated vertigo). This means that about three out of seven days a week, I feel dizzy for part or all of the day. If you've ever felt motion sick, you'll be able to understand the feeling, although it's difficult to describe if you haven't. The way I often laughingly put it: It's like being drunk, but without the fun parts. During these episodes, I am very nauseated and is really unpleasant to look at screens, read, or generally do anything except stare at a wall. Sometimes the episodes will be extreme: like the whole world is spinning, and I can't tell which way is up.\n\nWhen this first started happening, about a year ago, it was terrifying. I would panic, which would make it much worse.\n\nIn the first six months, I tried everything. I went to my GP, who referred me to an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist (ENT). I had to wait months to see her, and she ran all kinds of tests on me: I was put in a dark room, spun around in a chair, water was ran through my ears. Inconclusive--- I had inner ear damage, yet my body was correcting for it. I was referred on to a neurologist (another long waiting period), who told me that vertigo is really hard to do anything about. She diagnosed me with vestibular migraines, and then proceeded to try out 5 separate drugs over 5 months. For weeks I'd try something new, have terrible side effects, without improvement. I learned that most drugs have side effects, and a lot of drugs are used to treat secondary conditions but the primary use has serious effects (they tried anti-depressants, which can help but made me feel awful, for example).\n\nFinally, after 2 trips to the emergency room in 2 months, she recommended I try a blood pressure medication. That was the last straw for me---- I looked at the bottle, read the side effects (I already had low blood pressure--- so the side effects were, you won't believe it, DIZZINESS). I decided to give up on medication for a while. I want to add here that most of this journey took place in the USA, so the medical bills were beginning to pile up.\n\nSo I turned to the internet, and found many people suffering like me, without help from medication, and with the same exact symptoms. I don't have any wonder cure to report here---- but it was nice to know that other people were there, and were also frustrated by the medical system. I also took solace in my family in the times I was able to see them, who would come and sit with me when an episode hit. Talking to others, taking my mind off of it, helped.\n\nBut one of the hardest things was not wanting to tell people, because I didn't want them to see me differently or treat me like I was infirm. I didn't want to lose my job, and I didn't want my PhD supervisors to stop pushing me and giving me new opportunities. I felt that short-term illnesses people are compassionate about, but when there is no end in sight, eventually your lowered performance is no longer a case for compassion, regardless of the cause. I empathised with this position, knowing how frustrating it would be to have a colleague or a friend who disappeared for days at a time. Perhaps most of all, I didn't want anyone to treat me like I was disabled. I didn't want anyone to treat me differently at all, and I wanted their expectations of me to remain high.\n\nOn the other hand, my illness was invisible. No one could see my suffering, so no one knew to reach out and help. Sometimes we do need to be treated differently, and sometimes we just can't go it alone. I told my supervisor at last, and told him that I wanted to move back to the UK --- my home, and a place which, though the medical system was struggling, had universal healthcare and wouldn't charge me to get the help I could need in the future. I wouldn't have to be scared to go to the emergency room after a day of excruciating pain and nausea. So he ended up supporting me immensely with my goal of transferring my PhD, and I'm moving back soon.\n\nI've started down a new path, now. I don't know if it will be helpful, but I'm starting to acknowledge that I might never be \"cured,\" and that maybe that rhetoric ignores the way that most people with illnesses end up living their lives despite it, rather than conquering it. I think there are a lot of us out there learning how to live in peace with our unruly bodies, and I have found a lot of support and solidarity from friends, who after I confide in them, end up telling me secrets of their own. One has IBS, and has near-constant stomach problems. She told me a story: I don't think of myself as disabled, I think of my body as a Maserati. Sure, I have to be really careful about what I fill myself up with, but that's because my body is a luxury car! I laughed when she said it, and I carry that story with me. I am filling up my arsenal with other stories of resilience in spite of medical systems which offer no answers, or the wrong ones, and in spite of bodies that don't behave.\n\nI have also learned to be mindful of the fact that other people around me are probably struggling with something they're not saying. I don't give angry looks at people on the tube who sit in priority seats---- what do I know about their conditions? Instead of being upset with friends who cancel plans, or co-workers who seem to show up less, I give them the benefit of the doubt. Who knows what they're dealing with.\n\nAll in all, I see the stories I have heard as an ethnographer in past projects on technology and health and social care with new eyes, and I feel more strongly about projects to build social solidarity and informal networks more than ever. I for one will continue to do research and publish on these issues, and help design better systems. People are the answer. Keep up the good work, everyone :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-25 15:17:04", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 15:57:21.680574", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1463, "wiki": false, "reads": 26, "score": 97.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8985, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4131, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Looks v good to me</b>\n\nHi and thanks for doing the elegant writeups Alberto :)\n\nFYI, [Matthias] and I have been working on the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dS4AOmo1yjz-g9pwpj4Ywl-jOmfzh21TBQ44CmTQ4gQ/edit\">release for the community</a>, a more informal tone and trying to drop some of the jargon.

This marks a big shift for the project from being an idea developed during \\#LOTE and \\#LOTE2 to the reality of needing to prove the concept, which means between now and September there's a lot of work to do. It's absolutely critical to say at this point that unMonastery is as of yet not a fixed idea, we have worked hard in recent months to generate a sense of definition but one that allows for flexibility, is inclusive and allows for a collaborative process between all those that want to be involved. With this in mind, know that it is what you bring to the project that will shape its future.\u00a0\n\nSo where to start?

There was a time when 1500 people would cram themselves onto wooden benches for every show.\u00a0 As one enthusiastic volunteer, and excellent raconteur, explained to me, the audience could be quite rowdy and were know for throwing all kinds of things at the stage if they disapproved of the entertainment, including shipyard rivets, nails, rancid turnips, tomatoes and horse manure, it was not unheard of for someone to urinate directly onto the stage from the balcony.\u00a0 It is the stage where Laurel Hardy made his debut and it is rumored that a young Cary Grant also performed there. Between 1906 and 1938 the building had not just music hall and cinema entertainment, but also freak shows, waxworks, carnivals and a zoo.\n\nThe building was sold in 1938 to a firm that removed the entrance to the music hall and turned the ground floor of the building into a shop and converted the music hall on the first floor level into a workshop, hiding the balcony and upper auditorium behind a suspended ceiling. The balcony was sealed of and left unused, except for a few years during WWII when it was used as a chicken farm.\n\n<img alt=\"image\" height=\"539\" id=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/images/jpgs/britannia_music_hall_150411_aw.jpg\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;\" width=\"719\">\n\nSince Judith first discovered abandoned stage, much has changed; the false ceiling which once hid the balcony has been removed, there is now a charitable trust which has been established to help preserve the Britannia Panopticon, and a Friends organization which costs \u00a320 a year to join.\u00a0 Most importantly there are over 40 dedicated volunteers that work\u00a0together\u00a0to\u00a0rescue the auditorium so that it can be fully preserved and safe for future generations to enjoy as a \u201cliving museum of music hall and Victorian/ Edwardian popular entertainments.\u201d They have regular viewings, exhibitions, bazaars and traditional music halls shows all as part of their fundraising activities.\u00a0 The volunteers are working to ensure that the old music hall can remain open.\n\nWhat stuck me most during my visit was the enthusiasm the volunteers had for the building and it\u2019s colorful history. Everyone I met seemed to be deeply connected to the history and generous about sharing knowledge.

It <em>could</em> be that P2P solutions have a problem with collective motivation here, just as governments tend to rather react that act proactively, but more severe since P2P / underground solutions are so resource constrained. If so, that could point to a major issue with all P2P solutions into care (that is, making for a nice research focus).\n\nI'm pretty sure there is common ground to say prefentive solutions are preferrable (assuming that women who are undergoing abortion would have preferred not to, that is, not to have become pregnant in the first place). So, no need to refer to laws or morals. Even if the law allows it, there is <em>still</em> reason to prevent pregnancy.\n\nSo even though contraception is widely available in Europe, on a society scale there are still this many unwanted pregnancies. What I'm wondering here is about the reasons for this, and what P2P initiatives can do and are doing here? Of course this will have to do a lot with slow-changing \"fuzzy targets\" like culture, taboos, sexual practices and preferences. A crazy story from Nepal about how all this impairs the use of \"normal\" contraceptives among the young generation is <a href=\"https://globalpressjournal.com/asia/nepal/nepalese-teen-girls-endanger-their-health-through-overuse-of-morning-after-pill/\">this one</a> (Natalia found it some time last year).

I myself was there to talk about United Estonia, one crazy experiment back in 2010 that involved a fake political movement in Estonia and taking thousands to a fake party conference. It was a good seminar, with lots of good people including Dougald Hine who talked about the endangered future of work for example. Before the day was over, I was pretty much drawn to the idea to join these insane guys at Edgeryders in one or another form. \u00a0\n\nThere is something interesting about edges. In Estonia there is a small group of people called Seto. Their historic area is cut in two by the Estonian-Russian border, making this ethnic group one of the easternmost ethnic groups of Europe and one of the westernmost ethnic groups of Russia. Some say that even their name means \"neither this nor that\". Anyway, since most of my ancestors come from Seto people, I have a specific relationship with the idea of the edge. It has driven me to study cultural processes on the edges and there is no question to me that the edges are where the change happens. \u00a0\n\nMy background is in media and communications. For several years I headed Estonian government's communication efforts as the director of the Government Bureau of Communication. Later I became the CEO of Tallinn office of an international communications company, the role which included a lot of activities in three Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Somewhere around 2008 I started to tilt heavily towards civil society activities, I quit my job and created a social-political blog called Memokraat. Although I do advise also commercial clients today, I also spend a big chunk of my time on voluntary activities.\n\nIf that all sounds too official, then scrap it, the main thing is that I would be happy to join in if you need to talk to someone about making your messages heard better.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-03 16:04:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:55.011395", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 370, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17111, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4772, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>yes!</b>\n\nHey you!\n\nI'm traveling a bit and will be back in Bucharest after mid September.

So, usually when they were talking about technology, they were talking about break-ins, about bringing sites or services down - that's where the scandal is. Obviously, people doing such break-ins were hackers - as they did find fun in technology, were proficient and pushed it to the edge, and over it.\n\nThose were just a small part of the whole hacker community. But because of this mechanisms, because of media visibility of only the \"bad\" hackers (I'll get back to the \"bad\" in a sec), the word has been hijacked and started meaning something completely different in the public mind.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, to the \"bad hacker\" - one cannot even say that those people that break-in into sites are allways bad! See,many are trying to push the tech to the edge, test the security for the kicks of it. And they even more often than not notify the admins about the vulnerabilities. Hence, they are actually able to help!\n\nBut again, because of many psychological mechanisms (\"nobody will tell me my site is insecure!\") and botched law, such \"good\" hackers that break-in and try to inform the admins very often land in jails. This, obviously, does not encourage them to do it - as in, to inform and help the admins fix the vulnerabilities. So yet again, only the bad apples are visible. I.e. those, that break-in, do not help the admins, and actually destroy something or steal information.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd here's the kicker: such breaking and \"stealing\" information still can be actually good.

The answer is that there is no formal decision making process. What usually happens is someone with a need expresses that need to me in some manner, we converse about it over some communication medium, and then I add some functionality that hopefully meets that need. It's very do-ocratic. An example will help clarify this.\n\nThree weeks ago someone came to me in person and expressed concern that Celly, a SMS/txt messaging service that saw its popularity skyrocket thanks to its use by the Occupy Wall Street protest groups, was no longer suitable for their small group of activists. Two reasons were given: first, the service discontinued offering their free tier product line, and second, Celly began requiring users to install a smartphone app in order to send SMS messages. This causes two big problems for the activist who approached me. First, they have no money to afford to pay for Celly. Second, a significant percentage of their membership does not own smartphones, but rather flip-phones. These two issues are of course related: the local activists are all poor, working-class people.\n\nI asked them some questions about what they had been using Celly for. This conversation lead to a better understanding of their use cases. Effectively, they had been using Celly as a kind of SMS/txt broadcast channel for the group, so that one member of their collective to send a single txt message and that txt would be received by everyone else in the collective. The collective is small (less than 20 people).\n\nOver the next week (two weeks ago, now), I wrote a feature called the <a href=\"https://github.com/betterangels/buoy/wiki/Team-SMS-txt-broadcast-channel\">Team SMS/txt broadcast channel</a> into the functionality offered by Buoy Teams. It meets the criteria the activist collective needs, including the ability to use it forever with no additional financial cost. One week ago, groups using Buoy alreay saw an update in their dashboards and could download and install the new feature with one click.\n\nThat's the usual process.\n\nOf course, I have created more \"formal\" channels for receiving feedback. These include the <a href=\"https://github.com/betterangels/buoy/issues\">GitHub issue tracker</a>, intended mostly for coordination amongst developers (and I include people who conduct user testing, writing documentation, and other non-code tasks to be \"developers\"), the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/buoy/\">WordPress plugin support forum</a>, intended mostly for end-user-to-end-user volunteer support, our <a href=\"https://gitter.im/betterangels/buoy\">public Gitter chat room</a>, intended as a way to get live support if someone is available to offer it, and our <a href=\"mailto:betterangels@riseup.net\">dedicated project email address</a> available with PGP encryption, intended for those who need more assurance privacy but still need a support channel.\n\nIn practice, however, I am the only developer and have written virtually every line of Buoy's code myself, so GitHub is mostly just me talking to myself, the WordPress plugin support forum has seen some use but is mostly me answering questions by end-users instead of users helping one another out, the public Gitter chat room is primarily me making announcements about my own work to people who are lurking and watching me do so, and the dedicated email address is dormant and receives no mail.\n\nI would love for all of these channels to get more use, but the reality is that basically no one pays any attention to what I've done beyond nodding and smiling and expressing how good an idea they think this is to me when they hear of it. :\\\n\nTo wit, that story of the SMS broadcast channel feature that now exists in Buoy? After I discussed the use case with the person who approached me about needing such a feature that could replace Celly, I have not heard from that person on the matter again, despite repeateded attempts to communicate about it over the two weeks since the feature has been implemented. I say this not to disparage this person themselves, but rather to point out a pattern relating to your question, about how I receive feedback.

I can explain you more about it if you would like.\n\nIn short, if we would like to see a new reality, we must first firmly believe it is actually possible, and then work in that way until it is eventually reached.\n\nImagine one century ago somebody telling it is possible to walk on the moon, or to see and talk with other people who live in other part the world, just with a handheld device. Well, somebody believed in those ideas, that finally, with the help of other believers, were become true.\n\nSo, if we are dreaming with seeing a different Nepal, the very first step is believing it is possible, otherwise I would rather sit down, stare at the beautiful mountains and do nothing but relax.\n\nThere is a quote coming also from Napoleon Hill... \u201cWhatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-14 13:24:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.019276", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 429, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25063], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29571, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1135, "post_number": 30, "raw": "<b>Jumping in</b>\n\nHi Thomas,\u00a0\n\n<span>I waited to answer your question until we have details set for the next lote.\u00a0</span><span>It happens in Matera, Italy from 29th of October until 3rd of November.

I tend to agree that on a mythological level, the 'counter-culture' in America is more idealistic and positivist, probably in large part due to the legacy of (real, physical) 'open space' in which to explore and create anew by simply detaching from the old. However, that myth is being quickly dispelled in the 21st century--as is, I think, the idea of 'punk' and rebellion--in a more and more connected, finite, interdependent global village.\n\nI produced the video series for ELL last summer, and will be involved again this year most likely, and I'll say that almost everyone who participated in the first prototype experience would like to adjust the format for more emphasis on collaborative production and accountability. However, the first class of 'test subjects' also agreed that the initial process of more introspective and interpersonal work, hacking 'social DNA' together, although somewhat intangible and 'hippy', was powerful and necessary - something I tried to convey with images and thoughts in video form.\n\n<span>Thankfully, the setting of the labs is an interesting contextual mashup of these two spirits of 'hippy' and 'punk': there is a large area of beautiful undeveloped land where I am working on permaculture design and natural building, along side a gritty and corroded (but still very useful and upcycle-worthy!) old industrial site--so, look for an interesting hybrid blend of stories and styles to emerge in the next round :)</span>\n\nElf - I am so glad to hear you will be participating!

Get yourself a tribe, and \"arm\" yourself with skills so that you can be a productive and expressive member of the tribe.\n\nOf course both have a point, and circumstances may vary, but I much favour the second. Not really into canned food, and WOOO means we build so much stuff we don't need to defend every little thing because we can always create more.\n\nThere's another way to slice it: planning versus creativity. (What Vinay calls \"enhanced improvisation\".)\n\n- I've looked at \"contingency plans\" written by fellow bureaucrats, and they are useful because in order to write them you have to create a network of experts who face the threat (on paper) and keep each others' phone numbers (at least for some time).\n\n- I have come to realise those plans are just another resource. Good to have, probably, but you have to treat them like you would treat a \"probably outdated\" map. You must look at the world directly, or else. And there's need for innovation, not in the \"I must innovate\" way, but in the \"I'll do what it takes, and if it's new, it's new\" way.\n\nSo, yes: WOOO and enhanced improvisation.\n\nI guess it's not my job to try and turn that into policy (whatever policy is).

The former are typically produced by scientists and university researchers. Many of them are paid for by public money in the form of research grants and tenure, so an argument can be made that citizens should not pay again to access the fruit of that research.\n\nWith film, the situation is more nuanced. In Europe we have a comparatively generous policy of funding films in some countries (notably, buy not only, France); yet, producers insist that they deal in intellectual property rights. No tradeable IPRs, no films. To be sure, there is a solid private industry around films. While many people think existing copyright regulation is unreasonably rigid and has failed to protect the interests of both consumers and artists (for example the European Digital Agenda Commissioner, Neelie Kroes <a href=\"http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/neelie-kroes/is-copyright-working/\">is asking hard questions</a>), in this case there are not only losers, but also clear winners from legislation like ACTA.\u00a0\n\nHaving said that, you are still right: one effect of ACTA-style legislation is to increase the cost of compliance (\"I\u2019d have to work double the time: because the other half I\u2019d have to dedicate to making sure what I do is legal and that I\u2019m safe doing it.\", as you say). According to leading media expert Clay Shirky this is intentional: the idea of the pro-copyright people is that, legal sharing becomes difficult or expensive enough, people will finally stop sharing and going back to consuming pre-packaged entertainment.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/9h2dF-IsH0I\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-13 23:26:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:32.078727", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 309, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3167, "user_id": 2203, "topic_id": 3134, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**_Available in: [Armenian](#hy)_**\n\n------\n\n## _Armenian version_ <a name=\"hy\"></a>\n\n\u0533\u0578\u057e\u0565\u056c\u056b \u0567 \u0561\u0575\u057d \u057e\u0565\u0580\u057b\u056b\u0576 \u056a\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0576\u0561\u056f\u0576\u0565\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u054e\u056b\u0584\u056b\u0574\u0565\u0564\u056b\u0561 \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576 \u0540\u053f-\u056b \u056f\u0578\u0572\u0574\u056b\u0581 \u056e\u0561\u057e\u0561\u056c\u057e\u0578\u0572 \u0574\u0565\u056f \u0570\u0561\u0575, \u0574\u0565\u056f \u0570\u0578\u0564\u057e\u0561\u056e \u0576\u0561\u056d\u0561\u0563\u056b\u056e\u0568: \u053f\u0561\u0566\u0574\u0561\u056f\u0565\u0580\u057a\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0561\u0576 \u0576\u057a\u0561\u057f\u0561\u056f\u0576 \u0567 \u056d\u0569\u0561\u0576\u0565\u056c \u057e\u056b\u0584\u056b \u0576\u0561\u056d\u0561\u0563\u056e\u0565\u0580\u056b \u057f\u0561\u0580\u0561\u056e\u0578\u0582\u0574\u0568 \u0587 \u0566\u0561\u0580\u0563\u0561\u0581\u0578\u0582\u0574\u0568 \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0587 \u057f\u0561\u0580\u0561\u056e\u0561\u0577\u0580\u057b\u0561\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574, \u0570\u0561\u0576\u0580\u0561\u0575\u0576\u0561\u0581\u0576\u0565\u056c \u0561\u0566\u0561\u057f \u0563\u056b\u057f\u0565\u056c\u056b\u0584\u056b \u0563\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0583\u0561\u0580\u0568: \u0546\u0561\u056d\u0561\u0563\u056e\u056b \u0574\u0561\u057d\u056b\u0576 \u057f\u0565\u0572\u0565\u056f\u0561\u0576\u0561\u056c\u0578\u057e, \u0574\u056b \u056d\u0578\u0582\u0574\u0562 \u0568\u0576\u056f\u0565\u0580\u0576\u0565\u0580\u0578\u057e \u0578\u0580\u0578\u0577\u0565\u0581\u056b\u0576\u0584 \u0561\u0576\u0564\u0561\u0574\u0561\u056f\u0581\u0565\u056c \u0587 \u056b\u0576\u0584\u0576\u0565\u0580\u057d \u0574\u0565\u0580 \u0576\u0565\u0580\u0564\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0574\u0576 \u0578\u0582\u0576\u0565\u0576\u0561\u056c \u0561\u0575\u0564 \u0563\u0578\u0580\u056e\u0578\u0582\u0574: \u0531\u0575\u056a\u0574 \u0561\u0577\u056d\u0561\u057f\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0565\u0576\u0584 \u0574\u056b \u0584\u0561\u0576\u056b \u0570\u0578\u0564\u057e\u0561\u056e\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b \u057e\u0580\u0561, \u0587 \u0583\u0578\u0580\u0571\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0565\u0576\u0584 \u0574\u0565\u0580 \u0583\u0578\u0584\u0580 \u0585\u056a\u0561\u0576\u0564\u0561\u056f\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0561\u0574\u0562, \u0578\u0580\u0578\u0577\u0561\u056f\u056b\u0578\u0580\u0565\u0576 \u056d\u0569\u0561\u0576\u0565\u056c \u057e\u056b\u0584\u056b \u0576\u0561\u056d\u0561\u0563\u056b\u056e\u0568:", "created_at": "2014-06-11 16:47:10", "updated_at": "2018-04-14 14:01:49.822458", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 76, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26050, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 757, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>A third model: \"elderly peers\"</b>\n\nMy mother is now fairly old (she was born in 1937).

Like you, the Georgia trip was enlightening to me; mostly in terms of, how much life satisfaction people can obtain from much less material resources.\n\nAbout innovation in ideologies: I hesitate to say \"ideology\" as it's a convenient (while sometimes necessary) oversimplification to describe society as a \"system that works\", in the sense that (1) it can keep itself stable and (2) it delivers desirable life circumstances to citizens. Several existing types of societies are short-term stable (among them even North Korea, to some degree), none of them are long-term stable (in the sense of a fully circular economy), and those that are short-term stable vary in how well they deliver desirable life-circumstances. As you pointed out, capitalist Western societies are not the only ones to deliver desirable life circumstances, fail to deliver in various ways, and certainly are not efficient in terms of ROI \u2026\n\nBut, are we really short of innovative, workable <em>other</em> ideas for stable, well-performing (even long-term stable) societies? Not really, no? Your Guptastan would certainly work in several cases, namely where it meets with idiosyncratic circumstances that make it work, similar to how such idiosyncrasies made socialism work (in several but not all senses of the word) in Cuba and Belarus, and not work in other places. Even I have a proposal for running a society (a techno-social system for autarkic societies of 250, called EarthOS L6).\n\nThe problem seems rather how to make voluntary uptake happen for a new society design (uptake either by the elites, the common people, or both). Voluntary uptake is the only option for a new idea at its very beginning, since an idea all by itself has no physical means of coercing anyone. Where uptake happens though, growth and effect size can be dramatic though \u2013 as can be seen from the examples of various religions. As you noted in your <a href=\"http://athousandnations.com/2009/04/21/free-guptastan/\">Guptastan article</a>, the time has to be ripe for idea uptake to work. But these \"forces of the times\" can be catalysed by public opinion. Means, education can make idea uptake happen earlier, under less dramatic external circumstances.\n\nAny idea on how to educate the masses without control of schools or mainstream media? \u2026\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-05 15:57:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:43.600933", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 405, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21729, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2791, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>oh NOW I get it!</b>\n\nSo the Future Newspaper is a creative way of introducing each challenge identified at the workshops in a fictional way?

We often see citizens wishing that there would be 'more listening'. How does one learn to listen, if one has never really listened before? Are there types of personalities having more difficulties to listen than others? What are the real listening capacities of current leaders? What can we do to help leaders and managers to learn how to listen?\n\nMy biggest concern right now, is to try to find ways to help the current leaders to learn about listening.

They told me how they'd been taken to court under the Spanish building codes for not having planning permission. They successfully argued before the court that all of the buildings were temporary structures, that could be easily dismantled and moved, so they didn't need planning permission.\n\nSome research into the different legal definitions of temporary structure is needed.\n\nIn Scottish law, if you have a croft then you don't need planning permission for a building that is for agricultural use. It means that with croft land, you can easily build all the green-housing you need to grow your food, the plant-regulated growing systems to grow food, hexayurts for the structures, and the workshop space you need to manufacture it all.\n\nThere are hacks that can be used to work around these legal issues.\n\nI still don't see what the major problems are.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-25 16:02:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:11.680363", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 222, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11765], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27378, "user_id": 1673, "topic_id": 3926, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Future - Resilience - Diversity</b>\n\nHi Nadia,\n\nIt was sort of a spontaneous, somewhat sarcastic reaction to your blog post \"Kill your experts\".\n\nThere are many core questions here: Maybe it isn't so much about \"Do we need experts?\" If the answer is \"No\", then we better kill them, but I think we do need them, but indeed, we have to treat them differently (Which also means we have to treat ourselves differently, since we're all experts in something).\n\nThen there are the questions about the future. In order to prepare for the future, we want to built up resilience and key to resilience is diversity. If you have a bunch of experts, everyone with some expertise in a special field, now that , as a whole, gives you diversity, right? Or maybe not ... only variety. If all these experts don't talk and interact with each other, there is no diversity, only variety. Or if all these experts only report to some \"master\", one level up higher in a hierarchy, that's not diversity, that's Mediatization.\n\nMediatization is a bit like a uniform. You put it on, or better, someone else makes you put it on and you're temporarily deprived of own will and conscience, and you'll accept it, sometimes even like it.\n\nMediatization means you're giving up you're own reasoning, but you still have your body and your expertise. You still got your car and you're driving, but now uber is telling you what to do with your car and your driving expertise. And you feel empowered, because you're earning some money, but you have lost the ability -and the motivation - to interact with all the other cars and drivers on the road. They're all competitors now.\n\nProbably uber will then go on and brag about what a diverse company they are : They will put up pictures of a black driver and a chinese one and a caucasian girl (see linkedin or any other global company) on their website and say: look, that's diversity!\n\nWell , it isn't.\n\nSo, I think it's important to distinguish false diversity from real diversity. Next question would be: Is real diversity always a good thing?\n\nIf I have 5 excellent cooks from 5 different countries and they are cooperating closely and they give each other feedback and they talk and listen to each other and so on,\n\nthey can still mess up the whole dish can't they ? (I mean, they can be very very efficient, but not effective at all)\n\nDo we need a sort of moral / ethical compass (meaningful projects, as you put it) or is that not part of the deal? The experts in a more and more technocratic society shrug it all off: I'm just doing my job, like \"I'm a doctor, I don't care if my patient is called Hitler or Gandhi, I'll cure them, no matter what.\"\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-30 11:22:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:31.253649", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 509, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27139], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18833, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1236, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Thanks for sharing your story!

It is really important that you meet people at their own level when talking to them, otherwise nothing good ever comes out of a relationship, be it personal, professional, romantical relation or even a friendship. Me and my friends discuss this a lot and we always seem to bump our heads into the notion of manipulation, which almost always comes up in this context. In a way it is manipulation to alter your own behavior in order to achieve a positive outcome. However, manipulation is such a negatively laden word. But basically making the other person feel heard and putting your message across in a manner that is digestible for them is just effective communication.\n\nAs for the school system and the wasted years... yes, it is really depressing. And it is depressing to see the rate at which especially young boys feel left out and under-stimulated so that they drop out of school at some point. But luckily there are some initiatives and trends that seem to propose viable alternatives, which for me takes away a bit of the despondency. If you ever find yourself having an hour to spare on the subject I would recommend this talk with Astra Taylor:\u00a0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwIyy1Fi-4Q&amp;list=PL62142F721F29F138&amp;index=11&amp;feature=plpp_video\n\nAnd also, you might want to check our fellow Edgeryder Sebastian Hirsch's website:\u00a0\n\nhttp://www.playducation.org/\n\nBut I wouldn't worry too much about your son. Having such an intelligent and spirited mother will surely ease his pain during the long, boring school years! Besides, as my original post suggests, it helps having someone tell you what's happening around you. So it makes things easier having a mother to tell you that the school system might not be perfectly, but if he knows exactly what to take from it and what to leave behind in the classroom, it won't seem as dismal anymore.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-21 16:56:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:01.401275", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 411, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19985], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30117, "user_id": 2, "topic_id": 2805, "post_number": 24, "raw": "<b>Direct Questions in the Absence of Hard Facts....</b>\n\nFollowing on from Alberto's initial response....a historic building in a beautiful setting...but it looks quite dilapidated and overgrown and many of the pictures on the internet show internal disorder and scaffolding...so\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Who owns it and on what basis and terms are they prepared to lease it out.</li>\n\n<li>What is the current internal condition; does it have heat, light and water</li>\n\n<li>Is there a budget or grants for the running costs</li>\n\n<li>What are the heritage and conservation conditions and constraints for this particular structure</li>\n\n<li>Is it the entire structure or just parts of it</li>\n\n<li>How much of the adjoining land comes with it</li>\n\n<li>Do BergamoHub want to partner with us\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIf these answers are not readily available....then .... ppffffttt!!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-24 09:35:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:45.836620", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 156, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10505, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1355, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>The strength in (small) numbers</b>\n\nWow, this is really exciting.

In the sense that they are projections of the present to the past. Smurfs villages where division of labor, equal exchanges and barter (instead of money) are given as natural. I think (but my only source are my grandmother's tales) the economy of a village in the Alps, for instance, was based on the concept of enabling as expressed by elf (as far I understood his words). And \"enabling\" was the source of a slow innovation (Stuart Kauffman uses a similar argument in biology), very different in nature by the explosive and disruptive innovation rate in capitalism.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-10 15:53:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:41.241197", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 249, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 105], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9428, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 641, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Foodsharing </b>\n\nThe Foodsharing idea (https://project.yunity.org/about_foodsharing in English) just makes so much sense.\u00a0\n\nI am not completely sure we can classify it as \"care\", though.

If you do that, it becomes redundant to say that the goal\u00a0of the paper is to disprove the hypotheses.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Refer to data. As I noted before, data are very unique to opencare, because you have 200 informants (recommended minimum number of informants in ethnographic studies: 12), and because the primary data (posts and comments) and the secondary data (annotations and codes) are connected in the form of a network. This is a major methodological departure from run-of-the-mill studies, and the referees are likely to take notice. In practice, you could have a paragraph that says: we have this many stories, that many comments, authored by this many informants. We made X annotations using Y codes. We then proceeded to exploring this mass of data using [some method, for example I like to use the co-occurrences graph] as well as more traditional techniques of qualitative data analysis.</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2017-01-31 11:17:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:01.628175", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 344, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33084], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26317, "user_id": 605, "topic_id": 1708, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Hello Arina, \n\nwelcome to</b>\n\nHello Arina,\u00a0\n\nwelcome to Edgeryders, first of all!

I like spending time alone doing things I love (going for a walk for example...) and being alone never stopped me of doing what I want. I am not the type of person who always needs to depend on somebody and actually I m quite frustrated of people who are like that. If i want to go out i ll go, even alone, if i want to eat out i ll do it, even alone etc.. But there is something that differentiates us I can't being alone for long periods (e.g going for a leisure trip alone) and the reason is I feel quite boring when at some point I don't have someone to interact with...\n\nSome months ago I met a guy who is organizing every summer a \"find yourself\" trip somewhere in a Swedish landascape. You go all together you have talks and supports and then for three days you are left in the wild with nobody around you. Just you and the nature (no mobile phones, no books, sometimes no food etc). And then coming back together with the team to bring back experiences! He does that for the last 5 years, which for me was crazy.. Ok I can get to stay alone but this is about the complete isolation.

Our vision is to bring more transparency and education in food supply chains and the market, thus empowering all actors involved to become real game players. New technologies and\u00a0open data systems are proving to be really strong allies, allowing for more personalised service, more market awareness and more efficiency, without having to sacrifice the taste quality and cultural story of food and its territory, in the name of \"competitiveness\".\u00a0\n\nThe producers we work with are the real actors at the bottom. If they provide us with the right tools to work (<em>eg.\u00a0</em>good quality, nutritiouts ingredients), then we are able to pass them over to talented chefs, who become themselves storytellers of these foods and their territories. We believe that this is a trully bottom-up process, where we as supply chain managers become the facilitators of this process.\n\nOur clients (from small family businesses to large companies)\u00a0like this approach very much, because they understand that from one side there is more public awareness, on the other there is no much skill in the market to support this transition. Maybe it is true that we \"provide a service for a\u00a0market\", but it is also true that we see the \"market\" as an \"Agora\" which is not merely a space for economic transaction, but rather a place for participation and dialogue. Connecting conscious consumers with the stories of responsible producers is proving to be very strong. It just happens to sell well, too, so we as researchers don't necessarily have to find a job for a large multi-national agrifood company, but rather try to provide incentives for us, our clients/friends and make the system work for everyone.\n\nIn terms of criteria for selecting producers, thay are not really imposed by us, but rather suggested by the principles of agroecology, organic farming, social enterprising, family enterprise, with know benefits to the food market, \"from seed to soil\".\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-04 09:09:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:07.813244", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 409, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [9542], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11798, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1711, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Who owns the database?</b>\n\nRysiek, for me the database is really the main issue that makes or breaks your vision.

There are a couple of iffy incentive positions:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>impoverished citizens who are, at the moment, not paying taxes might wonder why they would give material goods like food to the government in return for a receipt of tax payment.

I had never thought of backtracking to the religion wars period in Europe to look for the sources of our own ways of life! This might be because religion was always a non-issue in my native Italy: people are Catholic, full stop.\n\nNow, Catholics come in all sizes and shapes, but that was always assumed to be OK (-ish): just like William of Orange's contemporaries, the Catholic church wants people to observe certain formalities and pay lip service to religion, but it does not actually demand that they really spend their time communing with God and all that. Catholics have a pretty sophisticated way to deal with wayward sheep in the flock: it consists of administering God's forgiveness for one's sins. The price you pay for that, of course, is abiding the formality of the administering: only priests can get God to grant forgiveness, you can't get it on your own. It is very hard to argue seriously with people like that! No, \"three strikes, you are out\", it's almost impossible to get kicked out of the religion. Whatever criticism you come up with, very smart priests will happily agree with you and then tell you that your very critique proves that you are engaged with religion, and therefore, to some extent, religious.\u00a0Being anything other than superficial Catholics in Italy is so hard that most people don't even make the effort. Consequence: to this day, most weddings happen between (nominal) Catholics.\u00a0\n\nBut you are absolutely right: if we tell people they are selfish, they will behave selfishly. Online community managers like to say \"if you design your system for trolls, your users will be trolls\" (though to be fair they think troll-designed systems\u00a0<em>attract</em>\u00a0trolls, they don't turn non-troll users into trolls).\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-04 23:24:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:49.364815", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 325, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32170, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3297, "post_number": 15, "raw": "<b>Reviving the \"count on me\" mailing list for the next weeks</b>\n\nHi all, long time no seeing.\n\nI thought you might be interested in catching up and re-joining a social media team with news about edgeryders.

It's just bad visualization, paving the way for misunderstandings and non-rigorous thinking.

What unites us is that <strong>we have decided to take personal action against the societal, environmental and economic challenges humanity is facing.</strong> Most of us have no access to the resources available to governments, corporations and large NGOs, so we tackle these challenges with what we have: ourselves, our own bodies and minds. Many of us are out to innovate, but not in the sense of making new gadgets. We aspire to a deep societal fix, for tackling the fundamental problems of expanding individual freedom, establishing a fair social deal, crafting an environmentally sustainable society.\n\n<strong>We are trying out all sorts of cutting-edge innovation</strong>: open source software, eco-friendly communities, non-transactional economies, protest movements, urban agriculture, nomadic lifestyles, mutual emotional support in the face of a tough environment, sharing economies, you name it. Some of the smartest, most generous people you will ever meet showed up on Edgeryders, apparently out of nowhere. Most of us are not wealthy; some are struggling. Everyone finds the time to compare notes, share what we know, and help each other.\n\nEdgeryders started out as a project by the Council of Europe and the European Commission. Upon termination, the community spinned it off and built itself a new home on the web. A social enterprise, Edgeryders LBG, has been created to maintain and support the community's infrastructure.\n\nIt this sounds interesting, you are more than welcome to <a href=\"/user/register\">join our community</a>. If you want to learn more about the enterprise, contact <a href=\"mailto:nadia@edgeryders.eu\">Nadia</a>.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-07-27 14:53:31", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 15:15:10.345875", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 313, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11393, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 1046, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Good questions ...</b>\n\nNoemi, thanks for the input. That's exactly the kind of input I'm looking for :)\n\nYes, what you propose can happen. People can make gain from their work (which is natural, as it's the conversion of worktime to something else). And creative, gifted people can make more gain than others. In barter like other trade, gain is difference from cost to price. However, different from trading with money, one member's success does not drive others out of business. Because to have barter trade customers for their produce, they have to take in the produce of their customers. Means everybody who can work can get business, the wage corresponding <em>to their own efficiency and desirability of their offers</em>. Which is why it is supposed to solve unemployment (the nonsense fact of having time and ability to work, but still being excluded from economic participation).\n\nAlso, multi-party barter does not allow financial speculation because there's no money and no interest. It does however allow to make gain by trading of goods, like import/export. Yet as there's at least some economic value creation involved in transportation, stock organizing and product catalogue maintenance, I tend to accept this because it's for real-world goods (similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road\">Silk Road</a> trading) and not just financial gambling.\n\nBut you're correct to say that multi-party barter is not a socially fair system by itself. It just fixes unemployment, but not the rest. And I'm not happy with the fact that it still allows a socially unfair economy. I welcome ideas how to fix this, esp. to arrive at an economy that supports the Commons. Without needing enforcement of rules by the state, because alternative economy can't count on that.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-04-17 13:58:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:05.770328", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 316, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [8439], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1696, "user_id": 330, "topic_id": 1663, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tPGojCxoozU/T_G2E-UUC-I/AAAAAAAAVMI/9-9jgKDXJMY/s1600/twitter-avatar_250px_reasonably_small.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"color: rgb(50, 82, 122); text-decoration: none; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; \"><img border=\"0\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1231e39be0b8e26ee972b3166e1be7cc09f69608.jpg' style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(204, 221, 238); border-right-color: rgb(204, 221, 238); border-bottom-color: rgb(204, 221, 238); border-left-color: rgb(204, 221, 238); \"></a>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; \">\n\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; \"><b>BREF APERCU : </b></div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; \"><b>Living on the Edge \\#LOTE</b></div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; \"><b>15 Juin 2012</b></div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; \"><b>\u00ab EDGERYDERS \u00bb</b></div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; \"><b>Conseil de l\u2019Europe &amp; Commission europ\u00e9enne</b></div>\n\n</div><div style=\"text-align: center; \">\n\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; \"><b>et les jeunes citoyens experts...</b></div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; \"><b>by Edgeryder Morgane BRAVO</b></div>\n\n</div><a href=\"http://unioneuropeenne.blogspot.fr/2012/07/blog-post.html\">http://unioneuropeenne.blogspot.fr/2012/07/blog-post.html</a>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center; \"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OZ-j7Z_NvnM/T_m-M1jUC6I/AAAAAAAAVS4/E8PyWouUnTg/s1600/IEdgery+AvVWCGjCMAAQKyM.jpg-large.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"color: rgb(50, 82, 122); text-decoration: none; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; \"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/4/46e7bc2f0c714f0ea17facb8cf290ca9aa68015a.jpg' style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(204, 221, 238); border-right-color: rgb(204, 221, 238); border-bottom-color: rgb(204, 221, 238); border-left-color: rgb(204, 221, 238); \" width=\"640\"></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center; \"> </div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center; \"><b>Cr\u00e9dit Photos \u00a9Morgane BRAVO</b></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center; \"> </div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; line-height: 1.6em; text-align: center; \"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-R0zA8ESD2r8/T_m8APaIHnI/AAAAAAAAVSY/GAS7XoHVp88/s1600/IMG_0041.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"color: rgb(50, 82, 122); text-decoration: none; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; \"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src='/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d024efa99cc6ac9034d44f641c37c5b70eb31c90.JPG' style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(204, 221, 238); border-right-color: rgb(204, 221, 238); border-bottom-color: rgb(204, 221, 238); border-left-color: rgb(204, 221, 238); \" width=\"640\"></a></div>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><b>Mme.

A few more recent examples:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><a href=\"/t/stewarding-ourselves-2-non-executive-directors-wanted-for-edgeryders-lbg/4255\">Stewarding Ourselves - 2 Non-Executive Directors wanted for Edgeryders LBG</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"/t/the-unmonastery-on-shared-ownership-in-open-collaboration/4192\">The unMonastery: On shared ownership in open collaboration</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"/t/how-edgeryders-has-changed/4260\">How EdgeRyders has Changed.</a></li>\n\n</ol>\n\nI think a very important aspect of facilitating an open community is recognizing criticism as valid in the spirit of building something mutually. As Sam initially pointed out, I believe it's in large part the tone of the conversation <em>on all sides</em> that hinders resolution and communication - discussion often takes recourse to legal structures (as final points, not open questions), calling into question someone's character, and technical uses or limitations of the platform. From my observation, this constantly sidesteps the issues at question.\n\nThese recurring themes, alongside closing comments on a thread with due relevance to the community, signals to me a strong need to critically evaluate the relationship between the company and the shifting definition of the community. I really welcome and appreciate both <a href=\"/u/caroline\">@Caroline_Paulick-Thiel</a>'s and David's offers to facilitate this process - there seems to be a drastic need to realign on what this work is in the spirit of, and thereby perhaps restart from a more trusting foundation on which criticism can be viewed as valid and constructive and receive reciprocal dialogue.\n\nI look forward to these questions being worked through.

Do we have a ready made recipe for that? I doubt, but can we start collaborating- \"\u00a0just act\" , and see what works best? definitely! \u00a0and opportunities are clearly there.

Here's why: representation is a statistical concept. The idea behind it is that participation should be weighted by population numerosity, but not by how much individuals care about whatever they are participating in. If one European in ten thousand keeps a snake as a pet, then we should have a snake-lover each ten thousand city councillors, and that's that.\n\nAn alternative concept is self-selection. People should participate according to how much they care about what they are participating in. Snake lovers might be more overrepresented in animal rights fora, and underrepresented in defense policy fora. Like in a barcamp, whoever walks in is by definition the right person.\n\nProcesses that work by self-selection, in my experience, are waaaay more efficient than those that work by statistical representation. Of course, you risk some elitism too. My personal choice has been to fight that by combining self-selection with an inclusive stance, and to use self-selection based processes more for information processing than for decision making.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-04 17:36:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:27.430335", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 202, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31726, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4525, "post_number": 22, "raw": "<b>More of a coordination costs issue</b>\n\nAs you say, <a href=\"/u/meenabhatta\">@meenabhatta</a>, collaboration takes time. Collaboration\u00a0with formal institutions\u00a0takes a lot of it, because you are dealing with people who are paid to coordinate, so (1) can afford to take time and (2) have trouble appreciating the constraints of non-institutional actors in this sense. In a Western civic participation context, the typical situation is: let's have an open meeting with citizens! It will be Wednesday at 10 am. Now, ordinary people are working on weekdays during business hours, and they simply cannot come. These decisions are rarely debated; they are simply made on the basis of the calendars of public decision makers. And yet, they cast a long shadow on the whole process, because essentially they mean: this process is only for professionals. This cannot but reduce diversity, which in some cases will be OK but in others will have very negative consequences.\u00a0\n\nOne of my fights is for all civic engagement to be done outside business hours (though this does tax the civil servants) or, even better, with asynchronous methods. It is one of the reasons I like \"online and open\" so much; people decide when and if to participate, so they will typically engage when they have time, are feeling relaxed and creative and committed. The beauty is that nobody needs to keep track of who cares about what, or when people have time: individual decisions result in an optimal outcome.\n\nMaybe <em>we</em>\u00a0\u2013 Edgeryders \u2013 should be designing and manning a dialogue space that works for people who are not paid to take the time to this coordination work?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-19 11:23:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:54.389871", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 290, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31621], "is_liked_by": [2560], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7475, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1697, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Amazing, but needs context</b>\n\nNadia, Ksenia and all, congratulations!

So you don't get salt deposits on the topsoil which is the case if rainwater is left standing on it. During the dry season farmers use this reservoir of water to continue farming for up to eight months (according to Bipaul) after rainfall has stopped.\n\nThe underground reservoir can hold up to 40 million litres of rainwater.\n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/125792111\n\n<em>\" Drought is a serious issue in the western Indian state of Gujarat, particularly for underprivileged female farmers whose livelihood depends on the monsoon.

There will of course be marginal conflicts about building codes, product certification, intellectual property etc., but these can largely be avoided by being friendly, or evaded by being mobile (for which I like <a href=\"/t/the-regeneration-of-meaning/2011/4\">Petros' approach</a>).\n\nWhat is however a real, unsolved issue in \"Parallel Polis\" (if we want to see the Open Everything movement as that for a moment) is economic sustainability \u2013 just as you mentioned. In my view, the biggest part of the issue is that, as long as the set of open alternatives is incomplete, we still depend on legal tender for some part of our daily lives.

Their thinking is: why dont we talk to management to convince them to give us 2 hours once a month to go out on a set cause.

I do encourage experimentation by anyone interested in the arts of systems thinking, collaborative sense-making, collective intelligence, networks, etc.\n\nAn important distinction to make is that metamaps is very \"hands on\" and participatory - there are relatively few algorithms at work here...yet. You create the map as a representation of complex subject matter, and then work with it any way you like to help organize and understand, iterate and refine, expand and subdivide. Your peers can do the same, on the same map or a fork of it. Topics are shared *in the entire platform database* and as you are mapping you are prompted to reuse existing topics where appropriate so as to weave an increasingly detailed contextual web around significant entries, which can be navigated through a separate portal called \"topic view\".\n\nFor example, the EdgeRyders topic \"graph\" on metamaps looks like this at the moment:\u00a0\n\nhttp://metamaps.cc/topics/8696\n\n...showing connected topics from *any map in the system* which contains that Edgeryders topic. You can right click any of those topics in turn and \"get siblings\" to see what's connected to them. This is a great way to quickly explore the collective \"knowledge graph\" - and if desired, save what you see to a new map and continue adding to it there.\n\nAlberto, connections on the map (aka \"synapses\") in many cases do have a label or type - when creating any connection the mapper is given the option of labeling it with a word / phrase of their choice. Both topics and synapses can be sorted and filtered by type on the map view. To view the synapse label / type you need to hover or select it (click or shift+click+drag).\n\nCurrently, data is accessible in JSON format and we're working on a more advanced API which will allow convenient import and export in various formats and the potential to interoperate with other instances of metamaps and similar LOD information architectures.\n\nI love what metamaps has done for us as a peer network collaborating to develop and distribute the platform - a powerful cognitive leap for individuals and communities of practice. I like to think of it as a \"pattern language operating system\". It's kind of fun and pretty too :)\n\nHappy to answer q's or lend support for anyone interested in learning more or trying it out!

This story and comments are REALLY interesting, also as a starting point for our challenge and the discussion that we would like to share here. Starting from Ginette/@Yannick perspective that identify these 2 main forms of Care: 1. Care that cames from love and friendship: 2. All other forms need to be done by the Government.\n\nSo the problem of scalability. We are seeing in our City and in Edgeryders, a lot of interesting care projects, community driven, but the idea is that the role for Government is to guarantee the scalability.\n\nWhat is the scalability?\n\nIn my opinion the scalability could be possible only if these new solutions, new approaches became part of an open policy making process.\n\nSo, in our case, the Local Administration has to became an observator, a facilitator of these initiatives, helping them to evaluate their own effectiveness and impact.\n\nIn our experiences we\u2019re observing many interesting care projects that are developed by communities, using new approaches to care, involving new actors (makers, hackers..)\n\nThese experiences are helping us to change also our services directly, to manage our services in new ways, trying to recompose the fragmented network of Care.\n\nI think that Government could be not an obstacle, or a part of the problem, risk that @winnieponcelet reported, but \u00a0(hopefully!!) a part of the solution: if tha PA can change its perspective and tries \u00a0not to be THE actor, the only care provider really allowed to do something, but one of the actors.\n\nAlso, maybe, to guarantee not to fall to a neoliberalism way to solve problems..\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut in which role?\n\nWe\u2019are thinking to develop this idea: became an enabling platform that can facilitate the dissemination of some solutions, and create the conditions to replicate in a large scale what has been evaluated effective.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut it\u2019s not simple, and of course we\u2019re talking in general.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe want to open a challenge about this topic because we would like to stimulate a debate and also find concrete examples about the role that in each project could/should be done by a Public Administration (in particular Municipalities).\n\nWe\u2018ll share also some stories of our administration that in our opinion are going in this direction, to rethink traditional services in the new context of Care.\n\nThis conversation could maybe became also a way to create a path for discussing how civil servants could continue to believe to do a \u201creal work\u201d and not just a prescribed, traditional work, @PhilippeDrouillon.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-02 13:07:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:33.399921", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 506, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19146, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 4089, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>will do </b>\n\nI can do the write up in the next days if it works\n\nthe Monday Noemi is referring to was yesterday or is it the next one?\n\nanyway I hope it helps , so I'll do it :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-10 10:10:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.807469", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 53, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17286], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21024, "user_id": 2566, "topic_id": 5034, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<a href=\"/u/nadia\">@Nadia</a>\u00a0It is true, a lot of Microbuses in Cairo operate using Handsignals. We are hoping to include those in our data collection, as they will be of research value for Social Scientists, and to capture them somehow for easing navigating the informal system. The How is a still an open research question!\n\nThe UNDP in Africa is in the know of digital matts (Our inspiration) and contemplating further action. Perhaps we can invite a representative to LOTE 5 to push from our way?\n\nMost of the informal areas of Cairo, which constitute a <em>majority</em> of the cities' residents were created in the 1970's due to rural-urban migration witnessed by Egypt. As migrants could not afford/find living space in the city they built informal quarters on the city edges on hitherto agricultural lands. Unlike African and Indian shantytowns however, most informal neighbourhoods in Cairo consist of stone houses with multiple floors; the newer ones often exceed 10 stories! Thus, they are permanent settlements in a sense.\u00a0\n\nI agree with inviting: \"decision makers within public administrations, program managers at funding bodies or project coordinators within private sector organisations such as banks,\" particularly public banks. Who knows whom in Brussels?\n\nI see the parallel with contemporary Refugee migrants, and how temporary camps could turn into permanent facts. It is when flexible structures that sprang out of immediate needs and according to immediate constraints turn permanent that obvious defaults and problems due to a lack of long-term thinking &amp; planning come into view. Think of access to transportation, and how this affects long-term viability off holding a steady a job.

Previously @fortyfoxes has suggested Somerset house, if that's not possible I can put my house and project space on the table www.limazulu.co.uk \u2013 alternatively I might be able to get us space at LimeWharf. \n\nI suggest we pencil the 30th as the day of action \u2013 10am to 6pm.

This will also impact sustainability, HIV/AIDS, security, conflict prevention, forced migration, etc.</li>\n\n<li>democratic values \u2014 respect for human rights, democracy, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, good governance, gender equality, solidarity and social justice</li>\n\n<li>nationally-led development \u2014 by the beneficiary countries themselves, based on national strategies (developed in collaboration with non-government bodies) and domestic resources. EU aid will be aligned with national strategies and procedures.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nHow this intersects with \"care\" would likely be mainly in the first of those bullet points.\n\nSo, it is my understanding (correct me if I'm wrong) that our creating a development arm of ER would more quickly go from a vague idea to something real if we try to put together a viable proposal.\n\nMy thinking about this specific EC DEAR proposal centers around the public receiving plenty of information and awareness from the press abou the nature and size of the problem with the occasional story about some group helping in some creative or interesting way, but there is no place I have found so far that informs you about what efforts are happening where, and more particularly, which ones are really making a difference or helping in a creative way at the local level. \u00a0So I'm thinking about how we could help raise awareness about what is and isn't working and what the obstacles are preventing some good projects from being better realized.\n\nIn the next few days I hope to get more specific into sketching out how something useful like that would work, and in what partnerships.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-20 03:45:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:59.764517", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 374, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4018, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3985, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We want to base Open Ethnographer on <a href=\"http://annotatorjs.org/\">Annotator</a> (not on eComma any more, @Matthias is sorry for the mess \u2026 but eComma was not a good fit after all).

In my example, a market where the price is zero for elderly people, and debts only have to be roughly paid back in the very long run. You might want to say this is no longer a market by definition, but I think you are still getting useful work out of the market concept -- which is really what I'm driving at, I think it's a very fair point that I may be stretching things a bit far.\u00a0\n\nThis is a 'semi-market' designed so that a person using the horribly named 'utility maximising' algorithm will also be acting to satisfy other goals, such as the heuristics given.\u00a0\n\nI'm also not sure it matches exactly everyone's idea of stewardship, but it can encompass many kinds of socially beneficial collective activity. For me, the fact that normal markets don't produce things that need stewardship, doesn't mean this loser definition can't produce those goods.\n\nWhen I thought of market failure in this loser concept of market, I wasn't mainly thinking of externalities. I was thinking of imperfect information - people simply don't know what can be supplied by this type of market. I can think of lots of occasions where market failure because of imperfect information has been improved - for example the warnings on cigarettes. I can also think of lots of times where the non-existence of a market has been improved by the introduction of a market, the classic example being the comparison between North and South Korea, or on a smaller scale <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_trading\">water trading</a>. \u00a0\n\nWith Taleb's thoughts on fragility, I guess you might think the natural 'wiggle room' afforded by the semi-market might offer a hedge against a black swan, but really I'm not sure his ideas apply to small local markets? The international finance system might be driven to become a tightly-coupled, complex disaster zone by efficiency, but is the same true of trying to efficiently allocate time slots for the town hall meeting room?\n\nI have the Graeber book sitting on my self - hopefully will get to it soon. This is probably a conversation for another day, but I think the idea of coercion is very weird, since I can't imagine a truly uncoerced person.

While in Bitcoin, currency (or better, the encryption keys to access it) are stored right on your computer in a small file. If somebody gets hold of that file, he has stolen your Bitcoins.

I must admit that every time I think it makes me frown. The part about fear of death really puzzles me\u2026\n\nI stumbled upon this text today, by Dr Deepak Chopra, about non-locality. With Michel Filippi, we discussed about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ervin_L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3\">Ervin Laszlo</a> in another of my mission reports (<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/bring-allies/mission_case/gratitude\">Gratitude</a>). This <a href=\"http://www.ascension-research.org/reality.html\">keynote</a> by Chopra (May 18, 1991) beautifully renders concepts that are difficult to explain.\n\n\"No matter where you look you'll never find the decision maker in the brain You'll only find the execution of those decisions. The motor cortex, for example, in the brain, it's that place that executes the commands. But where is the commander? You cannot find it. It's not local. It's everywhere or nowhere depending on your perspective. It's everywhere and nowhere at the same time. And that's who you are! That's who you are. You're everywhere and nowhere at the same time. You don't have a local address.\n\nAnd you're not confined to your physical body either. The Rishi when he finally understands his from his own experience of immortality, he says, \"When I'm in this state, I know for sure that my real state is this Bliss Consciousness. This bliss that follows me wherever I go. It's closer to me than my body, and there is no past because what I'm seeking is so near, there is no room for a past. What I'm seeking is the one who's doing the seeking. It's closer to me than my body, closer to me than my mind. It follows me wherever I go And when I know this then I'm in bliss.\"\n\nThis is not happiness. Happiness has reasons for it. You're happy because of a reason. But when you're happy for no reason whatsoever, then you're in bliss When you're grounded in this bliss then you recognize that you're not in the body, the body is in you You're not in the mind, the mind is in you. You're not in this universe, the universe is in you. Body, mind, universe just happened to you because you find them interesting. That's all.\n\nThis is ultimate Quantum Healing that gets rid once and for all of the maya of mortality, of the facade and superstition of materialism. When people get grounded in this experience then they lose all fear, including the fear of death.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-26 06:20:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:45.353045", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 494, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24628, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 2066, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Words for breakfast!</b>\n\nThis is certainly food for thought and an excellent way to wake up!

We propose 3 sessions involving drink/food (Tea ceremony, WeMixology , Agape).\n\n2. Our concept is \\#unCookd: hacker recipes for care, health and well-being\n\n3. Between today and tomorrow we flesh out the three session proposals on the <a href=\"/en/edgeryders-at-31c3/uncookd-whats-happening-at-the-edgeryders-31c3\">program wiki</a>: a) what is each proposal about, b) how does it work step-by-step\u00a0 c) how we build it step by step d) what ingredients and equipment are needed e) who takes responsibility for the session.\n\n4. We prepare and serve food at the food hacking base, but have a separate place (near fc slash 8) for general Edgeryders presence. Dorotea wants to know if we can set up a Hexayurt somewhere quieter for the tea ceremony...?\n\n5. Should it be vegetarian or vegan food? We eave it open, but try to source a basic list of vegetarian food. Vegetables, fruit, herbs are easiest to deal with. We ask participants to bring some ingredients.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">Questions:</h3>\n\n<strong>1. How to get people engaged?</strong>\n\nA. We use twitter, FB and the general 31C3 wiki to get them involved in the fun parts of the practical arrangements. Maybe we can reach out to food companies and communities too.\n\nE.g: Can you help us get to 100 ingredients for the \\#unCookd Foodhack at \\#31C3? Add one item to the list! (item, image, and commitment to bring it) [url coming soon].\n\nB. We crowdsource contributions to the \\#unCookd cookbook (with hacker recipe for care, health and well-being including missing recipies and missing ingredients.) [url coming soon]\n\n<strong>2. How do we get supplies to the venue? </strong>\n\ni. Projector and Screen: Does anyone already have these and can loan them to us for the event?\n\nii. Cooking equipment: Those travelling by car raid their kitchens at home. Same think here, we ask for help from \\#31C3 community. Full list available here [url coming soon]\n\niii. Food ingredients:\u00a0 ask people to say in advance they will bring an ingredient, as a way to remind them to participate, allow us discovery of new ingredients and keep costs low.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-04 10:35:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:22.358763", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 425, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17244, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3627, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Got it!</b>\n\nSo whichever organisation downloads and uses the app in their community has an opportunity to leverage the use according to their own purposes or civic goals.

Because that's what complementary currencies are always struggling with, so you're right about the apartment example for now.\n\nHowever, even if the state accepts Bitcoins, that would still not allow state interference and state control. Hard cryptography is in the way. Plain and amazingly impossible. (Except in a limited sense by dictating white market prices and exchange rates.) And by \"interference\" I rather referred to how PayPal etc. messes with individual business relationships. Accepting a currency is not really interference ...\n\nIn economics, I surveyed frequent talking about the \"independence of central banks from the state\", such that central banks are just to warrant currency stability and nothing else. That makes a lot of sense to me, as for example in Germany we have a sad history of how central bank credit was used to prepare for WWII. However, people are in power of the central banks, and politics regularly succeed in pressuring them to \"help\". See the LTRO and LTRO2 injections of the ECB - I'm not an expert on all this, but I doubt that it's the central bank's task to keep an ailing economy up, putting the currency to risks of instability.\n\nThat's why some people proposed to replace the seemingly \"untrustable\" central bank with a cryptographic P2P scheme. (Bitcoin is the first workable implementation, but the idea was around before.)\n\nYou might say, but then Bitcoin cannot ever help in economic recovery by means of \"quantitative easing\". Probably right. but we'd still not be damned to full-length depressions: I'd suggest that Bitcoin is more the \"value store\" and \"global transaction\" currency while mutual-credit arrangements like local currencies are more those to enable economic activity and help through recessions. Different currencies for different tasks, and why not have them in parallel?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-27 00:33:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:43.591317", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 384, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3285, "user_id": 21, "topic_id": 3252, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**_Available in: :gb: [English](#en) / :it: [italian](#it)_**\n\n----------\n## :gb: **_English version_** <a name=\"en\"></a>\n\nThis project of [food] redistribution is very interesting, we are also planning to open a center for food storage and shipping.\n\nTogether with you we'd like to organise an entrepreneurial project.

At one extreme you have Lucyanna wondering how your family life can be resilient to you getting a job in this economic climate; at the other one you have hexayurt wondering how you can keep people alive if the State fails and doctors walk out of the hospitals because no one is paying their salary anymore; or if gas and oil to heat up homes stops coming into, say, Finland in mid-winter.\u00a0Your report is closer to the Lucyanna-position than to the hexayurt-position, it seems.\u00a0\n\nThis is important because Lucyanna-type resilience is solved well by embedding oneself into a (generally local) community. hexayurt-type resilience - not always well, because at some level there is a potential for communities to break down as the competition for primary resources kicks in (think American survivalist in bunkers protecting their canned food with shotguns). Thinking of extreme problems might seem science-fictional, but as we speak there are ugly ethnic rifts appearing in previously peaceful communities in my native Emilia Romagna - simply because there has been an earthquake, those communities are now living in Red Cross camps and everybody is worse off and stretched quite thin.\n\nDon't get me wrong: community is a great resilience tool.

There might also be some misunderstandings, esp. you might want to provide more information about the nature of these \"ethnographic annotations\" you mentioned. Hope we can find a good solution for everybody. I still like the Edgeryders project and its potential for bringing change in Europe, yet I was quite ... surprised, to say the least, to find out about the actual mode of research and data handling. In my view, Edgeryders raises some very novel issues of how to handle data dumps that include semantic data that's manually annotated to open content.\n\nI can't pinpoint it exactly so far, but I'd say that it's a conflict between open content and open data. The two are not the same. Data is ordered, orchestrated, annotated content, stuff from which new data can be derived by <em>automated</em> means. There have been hardly issues about that difference so far (to my knowledge) ... but Edgeryders is on the cutting edge of that with this ethno software thingy and by providing open data dumps of CC-BY licenced material which was semantically annotated afterwards. So we better look at these issues now before it's too late ...\n\nThe core of the problem is that a raw, open data style dump of the ethno-annotated Edgeryders content is far from everything happening with Creative Commons licenced content usually. (I'd even say it's far from everything the licence creators had in mind; else there might be a CC-BY-NM (\"no mining\") licence perhaps.) Such a dump enables unforseen uses. The Edgeryders data is special data, as it comes from social interactions, so naturally allows to easily identify most of the people who contributed (even when there are no names anymore; but people often refer to their projects etc., as is natural in social talk and encouraged on Edgeryders, so just use Google). It is even more special because of the added ethno annotations (whatever these are). Ethno annotations and personal identification might allow malign uses never imagined when writing the content. Examples? \"Find me all people who did post in Spanish at least once, whose political ideas are considered anticapitalist and commons oriented and who mention any affiliation with a Spain based organization and who consider themselves as leader types.\" (Cf. the Edgeryders tribal signs ...). Might come in handy as preemptive measure against Occupy style movements in Spain this year ... see <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9198496/Spain-accused-of-draconian-plans-to-clamp-down-on-protests.html\">what they had in mind</a> already. The Edgeryders user base is too small for that, but ... you get the idea.\n\nThe reason why this issue does not evolve normally with CC-BY licenced content is that usually, no person has the time to do these ethno annotations and to provide the data in a nice, structured database for download. The moment that natural language understanding by computers arrives, or that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_linguistics#Author_identification\">forensic linguistics</a> matures, this will be all different and we will need to develop new open content licences, and linguistic obfuscation software. But for now, Edgeryders is pretty much alone with this issue.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong: I am not against open content. Not at all, I am an avid fan of all things open. I have several thousand pages of stuff on my page, all licenced CC-BY. And I've never had a problem. But that's because (1) I can avoid most potential problems by being in control of the data, requesting attribution to a pseudonym, and taking them down or even moving the site when needed, (2) the data is not structured and nobody has the time to structure / annotate it, so it's pretty forseeable what will be done with this data and what not. I don't release structured data about me in any way on the Internet; so for example, I have only very very basic and / or wrong stuff in my Facebook profile, I use ad blocking and track-me-not software on the web, I don't indicate my interests to Facebook by clicking any \"Like\" for a corporate page etc.. But I've no issue at all with releasing unstructured open content, as it is for human use only, not fit for automated processing. (Normally, until this present issue with Edgeryders where the structure / semantic annotations will be added afterwards by a third party.)\n\nThis type of managing my content is in line with my personal \"privacy policy\" that I settled on after quite a bit of consideration. There are three levels in it: content that I allow search engines to connect to my real-world identity, content that I allow law enforcement to do so, and content that I allow nobody to do so. (Note that this level three is completely empty and I don't need it currently; but I know the toolchain, and people under repressive regimes need it right now.) Content that I have complete control of (like on an own website) is on level one. Edgeryders content is at level two.\n\nHowever my privacy policy seems to have a hole in it, and I realize it only now because of the Edgeryders project. There has to be a new level (between 1 and 2) for content that I allow curious members of the public or of the research community to connect to my real-world identity by means of manual work. Did not run into this before - it was a complete no-issue so far ... . Content in this new level would be something where I am still happy if people connect it to my real-world identity by \"spying\" on me (or in other use cases, doing research on me). I doubt that Edgeryders would've made it into this level.\n\nThis data handling issue leads to another, and I think there has to be a clearer position here. On the one hand, Edgeryders is a playful platform that promotes social interaction in a cohesive community. There is also this upcoming conference, and we're treated as subjects with ideas and opinions to contribute there. Such a social setting naturally means that people talk about stuff and give hints to personal facts that they would not be happy to find again as structured data in a public database where you can run all kinds of queries on. On the other hand, just that seems to happen. By means of this ethno-annotation thing, we as users are treated in quite objectified manner, no longer as subjects, as peers. But if we are supposed to be in a lab setting for scientific observation, it would be better to introduce people right away to that idea when they sign up (just \"used for research\" is quite vague). There will be people who are available for this, esp. when adding anonymization tech to the platform. Or even simpler, do the ethno annotation in all the forums etc. where the Edgeryders topics have been discussed already. So in all I'd propose to either let us be subjects or objects, but this mixed state is the strangest online environment that I have been in so far. Does not feel good.\n\nSome practical proposals to discuss:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Clearly indicate what uses you will authorize for the open data dump of the open content entered into the Edgeryders site. Esp. please point out in the site's <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/page/legals\">Legals</a> what this ethno annotation software is that you use and what it can do and what people can potentially do with the data created that way.</li>\n\n<li>Discuss if you really want to do this \"open textbook science\" approach for the Edgeryders project, that is, providing a full, ethno annotated database dump for the research of others. See the above converns about people being still easily identifiable even with names removed.</li>\n\n<li>Give us a two week \"content freeze\" period near the end of the project, to look through the data we provided and to delete or adapt everything we don't want to be retrievable as structured data. This means that all content has to be editable, including comments that have replies.</li>\n\n<li>Make a user's profile page restrictively licenced by the author. The one place without a right to reuse the info on there, so we could easily share more personal info on there without worrying what will become out of it. Such a change seems needed to retain the social-network type character of Edgeryders, actually the basis of its success. Users must be able to share personal information without worrying what might become of it.</li>\n\n<li>Provide an option to the user to allow and disallow search engines to retrieve the info on the profile page. (This esp. has to include the profile image because mind you, face recognition is deployed already.)</li>\n\n<li>Provide a field in the user profile to identify just how CC-BY attribution should happen on reuse. The CC-BY licence mandates that the author can say how he wants to be attributed to, and I usually request that people attribute to my pseudonymous name when sharing things CC-BY. (That way, I can still break the link to my person by removing the source site where I published the material.)</li>\n\n<li>Show a link to this attribution requirement details on every piece of content throughout the Edgeryders website.</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2012-05-02 18:10:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.062074", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1657, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14486], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27114, "user_id": 1639, "topic_id": 2756, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Just saw this!</b>\n\nHey, thanks @Noemi.\u00a0\n\nThe website's using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapbox\">Mapbox</a>, which mainly relies on OSM data but allows for more styling.

The political process (and media) focus on high-level strategies, but the greatest impact reforms would come from reforming the govt's operating system: quite simply, the affordances of people therein. Example: my sister works for an Italian municipality called Modena. In a drive to contain costs, some genius passed an internal regulation that employees travelling on business (\"missions\", as they are known in the public sector) need an authorization from the highest political level (<em>giunta</em>\u00a0in Italian, which means the mayor and her close collaborators). This is such a hassle that in 99.9% of the cases managers renounce. Employees do not get to go to conferences. As a result, over time the whole workforce becomes isolated and its skillset depreciates and withers.\u00a0\n\nChanging this does not require a strategy. A workforce that stays up to date would help any mayor, be she conservative or progressive. It does not require changing the law, either. The city council could simply vote a resolution allocating a modest budget that each employee can use to go to conferences and events they are interested in. This would have a massive impact, in my opinion. Maybe @Franca has an idea of how these decisions are made (or, in the case of Modena, not made).\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-01 13:57:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.641937", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 237, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30318], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4045, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 4012, "post_number": 1, "raw": "We are building openethnographer on top of code from several different places.

Actually it makes little sense to say tickets are worth x or x in monetary value. Because they simply cannot be bought for money. This is true on several levels. There is no way a commercial events company could produce something like lote because what goes into it is a magic mix of knowledge, skills, passion and well...wierdness.\n\nSo I would suggest that with the exception of the most trivial tasks (e.g. join a mailing list), that each task completed is worth a ticket. But we ask each person who has completed a task to tell us how long it took and what difficulties they faced in doing it. This gives us two things. The first is valuable knowledge about which tasks take how much time. The second is that it is fair: you get a ticket when a task is done. If you are fast it is probably because you are skilled which is probably because you have put in your 10,000 hours to get there. If it takes you more time it is an opportunity to learn/ develop your skills supported by peers.\n\nEither way the \"price\" of a ticket is not an obstacle and the focus is kept on things getting done. So my suggestion is drop the money value of a ticket all together.\n\nWorks?\n\n", "created_at": "2014-07-29 09:43:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.282946", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 247, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19041], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11475, "user_id": 1571, "topic_id": 2070, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>tread lightly</b>\n\nWhat is amazing about it for me is that is basically a meditation on death.\n\nThe new year is celebrated now--late October, early November--as we head into the Dark, with the acknowledgement that the zone of fertility, of creation, is in darkness and chaos and chthonic energy. Underground, in the womb, out of the subconscious: this is where things are born. Fertility and creativity\u00a0are\u00a0celebrated, alongside death.\n\nAre these things sacred or secular-- creativity, fertility, death? I do not declare myself a pagan, but I want to celebrate these things, and I celebrate them alongside people who call themselves pagans with great love in my heart. Call me a believer if it's important to you.

You put in time for free, which you compensate with paid-for work. That's the essence of a volunteer position. And I do think it's important to call it what it is, because we'd otherwise be ignoring all of the lessons learned from other volunteer-based organisations.\n\nAs I see it, Edgeryders uses a mixed volunteer/non-volunteer approach, which is not so new either. Most larger volunteer organisations have people \"on staff\". However, where I do see things go wrong is where - as I think was the case here - a mixed approach (volunteer+non-volunteer) is applied to a single person. What I think ended up happening is that expectations from one (like outreach, which I considered volunteer work) ended up mixing with those of another (workshop, which would have been reimbursed).\n\nExtrapolating from this, other troubles that come with mixed volunteer/non-volunteer organisation are bound to follow.

The whole thing looks like matchmaking: great for ensuring collaboration, but I would hate to see great ideas go to waste because they don\u2019t match with anything on the ground \u2013\u00a0the whole point of having the Unmonastery in a place like Matera is to inject some novelty.\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Difficult.

When I moved there seemed to be plenty of jobs. It helps to move here with some sort of rudimentary skill. You may be working in a job that isn't your future goal, but if it keeps you in money, all the better.\n\nAs for your cultural life - woah - Can't imagine seeing a Midsummer Night's Dream performed like that, eye opening though it may be :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-10 06:46:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:01.396262", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 165, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26947, "user_id": 3185, "topic_id": 468, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Poesie in multilingua!</b>\n\nGrazie Rune per il complimento ...e per l'incoraggiamento (a non esagerare!)...\n\nEntrando nel merito del Tuo post, ritengo anch'io occorra una \"localizzazione\" pi\u00f9 spinta di questa piattaforma dato che purtroppo - almeno in Italia - la lingua inglese costituisce ancora un ostacolo importante e di fatto \"disarma\" qualunque buona intenzione.\n\nNon me ne vogliano i gestori ed i moderatori di questo strumento, ma credo che sia inoltre necessario ripensare in modo pi\u00f9 \"usabile\" questo spazio di comunicazione e di condivisione.\n\nRelativamente alla questione del target \"utile\" per le varie iniziative, come da Te sottolineato, penso occorra pensare a strategie (ancora) locali di informazione, di sensibilizzazione e di coinvolgimento delle innumerevoli entit\u00e0 rappresentative dell'arcipelago delle disabilit\u00e0 che, purtroppo per ragioni storiche, sono realmente poco inclini a collaborare fattivamente con quanti (a torto, naturalmente!) ritenuti concorrenti se non avversari nel complicato sistema della visibilit\u00e0 e del riconoscimento istituzionale che si traduce sistematicamente\u00a0 in sovvenzioni piuttosto che in vere e proprie convenzioni quasi sempre prive di oggettive valutazioni in tema di costi-benefici e di efficacia-efficienza in un contesto di progettazione e di pianificazione degli interventi e dei servizi.\n\nPersonalmente, come scritto altrove, ho trovato poca predisposizione da parte di queste a me note organizzazioni a creare sinergie ed a mettersi in gioco in progetti che non si traducano in un immediato \"ritorno\" istituzionale.

It's about defining data exchange standards, programming plugins for several CMS and document authoring systems, and of course getting all the collaborative economy directories on board first. Settling for one shared directory with open governance (in analogy to WIkipedia) would be far simpler in terms of effort, but is probably also more unrealistic ... . Not sure what we could do ...\n\nThe other thing is, given the fact that there are so many P2P project directories out there already, we probably should in our guide move beyond this and collect the experience of <em>using</em> P2P resources.

One of the reason is that the word \"common\" itself is so....common...that it may refere to various ideas.\n\nFor example the idea of common heritage (for me, but not only for me) is not coincident with the one of commons: there are points of overlapping but it's not the same.\n\nOne of the reason behind this issue is that....we can make a game and ask to people \"talking and caring\"about the commons when this topic arised, I guess than half of them will consider it very very recent \u00a0(I am not talking of researchers, of course). They won't be completely wrong because as a matter of policy making (as you underlined) it is actually very recent....but it is an argument for economics since almost 45 years!!!\n\nMoreover I agree with you about common resources (discourse close to the one on common heritage).\n\nThe connection between commons and community and responsibility, for example is etymological..since Latin, but almost no one knows about it (I am pretty sure about it since part of my dissertation was about it!)\n\nAnother issue is about the difference between \" the common good\" (which is, at least in Italian, \"what is good for the entire community\" or \"what is good for everyone), \"the common\", singulare, or better \"the commonwealth\" (as the famous book by M. Hardt and A. Negri) and \"the commons\", plural, or \"the commons good\".\n\nFinally he idea of commons has been used (at least in italy) as political slogan by traditional leftwing parties, which might be good, beside the fact that they did it in a completely meanless way ( this is strictly my opinion, of course)\n\nThen there are all the legal stuff concerning the commons and their position between public and private.Nowhere in the legislation in europe there is any reference to the commons.\n\nThere has been a legal document in Italy and there is an European Citizens initiative about it...but both of them haven't had any practical result yet.\n\nCommons are matter of economics, policy makin, politics and law; beside being a social argument!\n\nThat's what I meant with talking about the language of the commons...\n\n(and by the way I am doing a research about it!)\n\nI hope I was enough clear,\n\nand apologies for replying so late to your first question, Noemi\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-04 07:46:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:13.858251", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 477, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12061], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33107, "user_id": 1438, "topic_id": 1839, "post_number": 42, "raw": "<b>involving local community</b>\n\nHi [valentinabrogna] and you all, I'll try to give some update and add some new questions\n\nRECIPE: how many people will eat?

Using <a href=\"https://www.loomio.org/d/p1w0UZzs/new-residencies\">https://www.loomio.org/d/p1w0UZzs/new-residencies</a>\u00a0would and should be the way to go. I remember well the original discussion at unMonastery about this topic. Your suggestion, which was supported by the whole group, was that given there was short term space at the unMonastery, and a pressing need for Italian speakers and other forms of project help, we should look for people to fill these places based on reputation and the need of the project. This reputation based do-ocracy is at the pragmatic core of EdgeRyders.\n\nAs @mariabyck was the only person objecting to this approach - because of her passion for democratic inclusion (particularly for the local people living and working in Matera), it was suggested that she take a lead on this issue - which she has valiantly done! It's a lot of work, and she should be praised for putting the time and effort into to do this.\n\nHowever...\n\nI'm making this post to introduce a topic I feel is central to both democracy, and effective community engagement. This is <strong>not</strong> the way to do things! This is a half hearted and superficial way to attempt democratic community engagement.\n\nIt is half hearted because it is neither democratic, nor makes effective use of personal knowledge and real word-of-mouth engagement of people on the ground. Also, and importantly, it is not transparent. As was brought up in the original meeting, but so far not addressed (at least publicly), the hard question is not - let's make a widely publicised \"call\", nor \"post your project proposals on a web site so everyone can read it\". The real democratic question is <strong>who decides.</strong> Is it a small group, all the present residents of the unMonastery? Or perhaps the whole EdgeRyders community? Do we include people in Matera? These are the real issues.\n\nTrue democratic transparency would be to use something like Loomio, and / or hold local group meetings to get peoples opinions locally who don't use these platforms. True effective community engagement would have been to trust people on the ground and actively go out and seek people with the required skills. Doing a bit of both gives us the worst of both worlds - a long process, beds empty, projects with unmet needs and no real democratic decision making ever taking place. I feel strongly that both strategies are good, if they are done fully and properly in a transparent way, but this is not the way to do it. It's a pigs dinner and we can and should do better than this!\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-15 14:59:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:55.654448", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 472, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 15.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [82], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24010, "user_id": 3324, "topic_id": 6005, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>@Noemi</b>\n\nHi@Noemi\n\nI cannot see any Edit botton..\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/45af62adfc9278688e178c5096a53e645142c667.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-06 15:31:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:13.117830", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 39, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21990, "user_id": 3639, "topic_id": 816, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Hello Dr Saeed</b>\n\nThank you for your encouragements.

Typically, if job X or task Y didn\u2019t get done, or got done poorly, it\u2019s not a life-or-death situation.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Authority is non-coercive.</strong></li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWorking to accommodate to higher stakes and more authority (presumably of the\u00a0capital providers/ managers etc) already means stepping into a new space with rules different than those on an online playgroud. Which means acquiring new skills - beyond the physical skillset which for people like myself,\u00a0sounds pretty scary I must say.\u00a0Point 8 is indeed.. yikes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-02 23:18:09", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:52.335609", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 246, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30197], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22216, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3989, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Info?</b>\n\nSure, <a href=\"/u/almereyda\">@almereyda</a>, thanks for reaching out.

However that is quite some complexity for the views system to handle. A more elegant way would be to extens Open Ethnographer to add a \"Content: Annotation count\" pseudo-field that can be selected in views. Similar to how \"Content: Comments count\" <a href=\"http://drupal.stackexchange.com/a/108337\">is available</a> for comments.

You say we need management (in a broad sense), then you define bureaucracy as the thing that does management (i.e., you define it functionally). At this point, of course, you can conclude you need bureaucracy. I tend to think of bureaucracies as <i>solutions</i>\u00a0to the management problem (economists prefer to speak of coordination). The same function can be performed by other things, like algorithms (when A, do B) or charismatic leadership \u2013 only, these alternatives have not historically performed as well.\u00a0\n\nI suppose you could say that most hacks we or anyone else can put together will probably include some bureaucracy somewhere. But it might be misleading to speak of the creative power of bureaucracies, because it points in the wrong direction. We are <em>already</em> coordinating almost everything by bureaucracies, with market joining up the different ones.

I was stricken by this comment. It contains a powerful intuition, namely that money can be a problem too. Or rather, than sometimes it's better\u00a0to have no money at all than just a little money. For handling money costs money, and people dealing with your project shift onto a different mode. If you have none, than you waste no time thinking about it, allocating it, trying to be transparent as to where it comes from and where it goes, and you just get down to do stuff.\u00a0\n\nHaving a lot of money is also a viable model. You need to spend a lot of resources to manage the money, but hey, you've got money! You can just hire administrators, accountants and generally people who will take care of it.\u00a0<span>The worst is hav</span><span>ing just a little money: you get the administrative issues but not the firepower.\u00a0</span>\n\nI like the Trasformatorio concept.

So thanks for revitalizing \"democracy\" for us, the word and the idea.\n\nIt also seems a good idea to start with participatory projects on the local / municipal level. It has the best chances to work here, as this level is not too attractive to serious \"power junkie\" politicians, so that there's a good chance for a deliberation process rather than power struggle. I'm still suspecting power struggle will always dominate politics in larger groups, and bring about bad decisions - but welcome to prove me wrong here.

Some examples (just brainstorming without having put a lot of thought into them):\n\n<strong>A non-monetary </strong>\"small \"reward could be to offer one hour of your time helping them think about their own project. An intermediary reward could be to mention them/their contribution in a publication or blogpost with your reflections on questions relevant to your research work.

The unMonastery logo been kind of freely used but I've been interfering in other situations where I think it was used in a non-beneficial way. Somehow acting as the graphic profile and guidelines that haven't been formalized. This I'm not doing for my own interest. I want unMon to look good in other peoples eyes.\n\nThe problem with the t-shirt idea for me is that they try to drag and present unMonastery as something that is far away from the VISION. The question is.... Why do you want to do that @Alberto ?\n\nI hope we all can agree on that the logo of unMonastery is there to be used for the BENEFIT of the project. Giving away soulless t-shirts to volunteers is just not along the line here.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-29 20:04:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:51.874510", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 196, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7523, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 644, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>You're really lucky</b>\n\nWhen I started reading your story I was already hearing the usual remarks people give - you know the worst thing to tell to someone who is depressed is \"pull yourself\u00a0together\"; or \"you have everything to be happy\".\n\nYet it seems your close friends and family did find a way to reach out, however ineffective\u00a0or patronising,\u00a0as any advice can\u00a0be after all, which is not to blame.\n\nWhat made you share this, @Pauline?

Anyway, maybe a <em>bit</em> more clarity:\n\nFirst paragraph: To me, current large-scale social enterprises failed as well. I'm not proposing that again, but looking for a <em>new</em> mode of organizing activity. Not necessarily the corporate model, but the compensation model. Compensated however it has to be. Because pure volunteer movements like after the earthquake here burn out after 2-3 months at latest. If the volunteer professionals don't get enough back for basic survival plus some comfort, why would they want to volunteer long-term? And something long-term is needed for keeping infrastructure up and running \u2026\n\nSecond paragraph: I don't look for <em>regulated</em> citizen activism. To the contrary, it should stay as DIY-able, grassroots and unregulated as possible, to not fall for the same reasons of inefficiency and corruption that entrenched organizations (incl. public bodies) fall for. Grassroots activism includes (in my interpretation here) that <em>no</em> long-term, large organizations are required. Grassroots activists must be able to immediately disband a movement / organization and regroup into another one whenever there is abuse of authority or power. I admit this idea is influenced by my own anarchist thinking ;) The magic missing piece I'm looking for is this: a process or tool to allow this disbanding/regrouping, and at the same time a process or tool to allow organizedness and guaranteed compensation. These are usually only found in established organizations, which I want to avoid by all means b/c these usually bring in all kinds of problems again (from power abuse to corruption).\n\nThird paragraph: The Google etc. policy of allowing staff to work one day on a pro-commons project of their choice \u2026 I think for collective action it's pretty useless (by itself). Because like other forms of direct volunteering, it requires the coincidence of (1) having the skills for supporting a certain project and (2) wanting to support that certain project. Quite improbable to happen, not really useful for large-scale, powerful collective action. With economic exchange (using money, barter value or otherwise), both elements are de-coupled, only one condition has to be met for one person. That's where we are heading for with Makerfox, while trying to avoid (always scarce) money \u2026\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-21 18:06:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.886774", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 416, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23011], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20688, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4369, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Hi @Alberto,\n\nUnfortunately I will not be able to postpone my flight as if I don't fly on the 4th, my daughter turns 2 on the 5th and I will have to pay double price(it's around 1000$ per ticket) and there are not many flights from Morocco to Armenia, Air France being the only reasonable option.\n\nHowever, I am now looking for somebody in Morocco for this position and I will keep you posted.\n\nDo not hesitate to contact me if you need any info about Morocco.\n\nCheers,\n\nAnna\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-18 12:25:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:55.165064", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 104, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12259, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1291, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Negative loops exist</b>\n\nDead right: it's a negative loop.

After the earthquake, I marvelled how quickly people can self-organize help after a disaster. But the volunteer disaster response movement could even be better, faster and larger. If \"how to be part of volunteer disaster response\" would be part of the \"curriculum\" for disaster preparedness, it might be <em>the</em> missing piece for better volunteer / community-driven disaster response.\n\nThat knowledge is not documented yet (as far as I know; I collected some pieces into <a href=\"/t/how-to-for-community-driven-disaster-management/4530\">a recent post</a>, but it's only a start). Inviting the people who led these volunteer disaster response initiatives here in Nepal might be a way to start though (and it's often surprising who stepped forward into these leadership roles, responding to the need to help).\n\nWhy am I writing this \u2026 . I have the impression that the Nepal society is not an environment to organize big, top-down, strictly organized disaster response forces (as the Chinese do, for example). Rather, the strength here seems to be fast and organic, community-driven response. If education can strengthen that more, maybe this grassroots way of disaster preparedness is the much cheaper, more efficient alternative? It would enable people to quickly switch over from \"normal mode\" to \"disaster response mode\", everyone knowing what to do and how to work to limit and fix the damages after a disaster. Not \"knowing\" from specific commands, but from being expert enough in the matter to know what's the next step.\n\nAny thoughts if and how this could play out in Nepal's society?

It truely is a remarkable document - particularly given it's directness in communicating the daily rhythm of the monastery as an organisational form.\n\nSo I very much welcome the proposal to begin work on consolidating the knowledge and practices we've developed throughout our time in Matera. I do though have some trepidation. Initially the timing, I had discussed with @arthurD whilst he was here the need to schedule a week long debrief and decanting of knowledge after we wind down the initial prototype - away from Matera, so that we might gain some perspective in a neutral space. In July my fear would be that there simply won't be enough people with the insight needed to produce this document authenticately and reliably; i.e @kei @crisitiano siri and @pavlik elf @lucia will not be present at all.\n\nMy second concern is authorship and I guess this is where I'd seek clarity, I sit for the most part on the side of anonymity as a tool for spreading knowledge. The ideas that I believe travel furthest in this moment are not ones asigned to individuals but pseudonyms and this comes through the experience of publishing almost everything I have done personally and as a group under alternative non-attributable names.

As good as the Makerfox is, we will need plenty of social stuff (from signaling to handholding) to be able to make a reasonable test of it as a collaboration enabler. My reference for this is the unMonastery, which took plenty of time and effort. I think the Makerfox might be in late 2014 what the unMonastery has been in late 2013 and early 2014: some kind of flagship project, to make some investment on.\u00a0\n\nSo, yes. I would be up for setting up and communicating carefully a medium-scale collaboration experiment as mediated by the Makerfox. I could ask my friend Giovanni Ponti, an experimental economist and mechanism designer, now teaching in Rome, to make suggestions for how to come up with a rigorous experiment, something that would deal with the counterfactual nature of economics. Ideally, we want to\u00a0<em>prove</em>\u00a0that the Makerfox deployment has enabled more collaboration than in the counterfactual of same project but no Makerfox. That's much more rigorous than we ever have been.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-25 11:25:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:38.470318", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 194, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15518], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1337, "user_id": 10, "topic_id": 1304, "post_number": 1, "raw": "19 towns in Romania took the streets on Feb 11<sup>th</sup>, at -12 Celsius degrees, in a coordinated effort widely promoted through social media networks. According to the press, over 2000 people marched through the city centre in Cluj, which is a real crowd (anti-government protests only gathered couple hundred people!). Some sources say that the crowd in Cluj was even bigger than in the capital city Bucharest. I\u2019ve seen mostly young people, but not only: from 12 year olds to pensioners, people had a common voice shouting: \"ACTA you can bet/ Romania will strike back\", \u201cWe apologize, we feel under surveillance\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m a dissident\u2019s son/ I use torrents\u201d \u201cOle, ole, ole, our volition is candid, Romania liberated\u201d among others having very explicit words.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/8OWGzMLDfMY\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith the advent of Internet, many people have chosen to spend important amounts of their everyday lives in the virtual world for a variety of reasons. It was particularly interesting to see the people \u201cliving in the Internet\u201d walk right beside you on the streets. Even though cyber activism has gained tremendous importance and impact (Wikileaks, Anonymous, Avaaz, Change.org, etc.), the traditional marches are still able to bring up the sense of common belonging and raise the people\u2019s subjective power, in ways that virtual activism can\u2019t.\n\nArguably, an important catalyzing factor for an impressive crowd at the protests around the country was a web design website creativemonkeyz.com based right here in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Instead of posting one of their hugely popular animated comic mini-series, they released an informational and mobilizing video about the meaning and potential dangers of ACTA. Still, some teenagers were satisfied just by getting a Guy Fawkes mask, which were shared by the organizers on the spot, had little particular interest in the cause and left even before the march has started.\n\nSo, what\u2019s in it for me? Every autumn I try to help my grandparents with the harvest. One of the biggest trademarks of Moldova is its delicious wine. It\u2019s a tradition that every hardworking householder (\u201cgospodar\u201d) in the countryside has to make his own wine. I just love helping my grandfather in making wine. Usually every <em>gospodar</em> has his little secret ingredient, formula or method for making his wine especially tasty, with a unique aroma and flavor. Now, I if we were to take this example to the extreme, let\u2019s imagine a possible scenario if ACTA would be ratified in Moldova or elsewhere. In the spirit of preserving the traditions and customs that span for generations, my grandfather would have to pass his secrets of winemaking to me informally. Therefore, if ACTA regulations were in place and somebody got a hold of a sample of my grandfather\u2019s wine and patented the formula, my grandpa and I would be in serious trouble. If I understood correctly, first of all, it would be legally prohibited to use my grandparent\u2019s recipe in making wine and even worse, we may risk serious fines or even imprisonment. It will also be illegal if I decided to commercialize my produce at the local market. In the end, when my grandfather passes away he\u2019ll have no other choice but to take his winemaking knowledge to the grave along with him and therefore be lost and forgotten.\n\nAnother very sensitive subject to me is music. I think that 300+ GB of music that\u2019s on my hard drive is a sufficient argument to describe my \u2018addiction\u2019 to music. The debate about the ownership, legal rights and sharing of art work has been around for ages. There are many outspoken artists when it comes to this subject. One quote that is particularly appealing to me belongs to none other than Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age, Probot, Them Crooked Vultures):\n\n<em>\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea because it\u2019s people trading music. It has nothing to do with industry or finance, it\u2019s just people that want music and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It\u2019s the same as someone turning on the fu**in\u2019 radio, it\u2019s the same as someone putting a cassette in the cassette deck, when the BBC plays a special radio session. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a crime; it\u2019s been going on for years. It\u2019s the same as people making tapes for each other. The industry is more threatened by it because it\u2019s the World Wide Web and it\u2019s a broader scope of trading, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a fu**in\u2019 horrible thing. The first thing we should do is get all the fu**in\u2019 millionaires to shut their mouths and stop bitching about the 25 cents a time they\u2019re losing\u201d </em>\n\nSo, this was my take on the anti-ACTA protest in Cluj. I\u2019m sure that other Edgeryders have joined the wave of protests, so I\u2019m curious what did other people have experienced in other towns around the world? Go ahead post your comments below and through this, we could all put together stories and try to build up a global collective statement.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!\n\nP.S.

Thanks.\n\nI suggest with insistence that the different activities and approaches need to be called with different names, or at least a combination of names.\n\nI personally feel this can be beneficial.\n\nIMHO, from what I perceive, I feel that first and foremost, Edgeryders is the build up of a\u00a0<strong>brand for a forum </strong>( and technically speaking, an aggregator of attention and interaction )\n\nI personally sense that the basic Edgeryders brand is about simply that : an online forum.\n\nAfter that, several spin off brands can emerge, such as \"Edgeryder Events\", or \"Edgeryder Collectives\" - though for now examples of such\u00a0names / brands used for that seems to be Edgeryders <strong>Lote</strong>\" and Edgeryders\u00a0<strong>unMonastery</strong>.\u00a0<span>Yet I also imagine that these complemetary brands can be used separately / not necessarily connected to the Edgeryders brand, if and when it is not initiated and organized using\u00a0the Edgeryders forum, or that they can choose not to use the Edgeryders brand.</span>\n\n<span>I want Edgeryders as a forum to discuss ways of incubating various other tools that can eventually be reified as other brands, and progressively use these to continue building and connecting shared networked infrastructure.</span>\n\nI see Edgeryders as a\u00a0brand that , apparently, currently builds itself on existing networks of\u00a0people and projects who are already invoved and highly empowered. \u00a0In\u00a0other words, Edgeryders is not a brand describing\u00a0each of these existing projects and networks. \u00a0Edgeryders only describes a more specifically defined\u00a0online forum as tool , midst other online forums,\u00a0that eventually leads to\u00a0processes of convergence and mutual facilitation. \u00a0It does not generate what it feeds itself from.\n\nIMHO, I do not want Edgeryders to become a brand used to describe me or my activities, simply because I interact using Edgeryders. \u00a0I am not an Edgeryder.\u00a0 I am a user of Edgeryder - the forum. \u00a0And I am connected to a multiplicity of people and networks of people, including through the Edgeryders forum - many of which I have been connected to before Edgerders forum, and many with whom I interact with without being dependent on Edgeryders.\n\nIn that sense, it is not like a coworking space, and even less so like a company. It is also important to me that it is not used to describe a community or a culture. \u00a0\u00a0Imho, from there on,\u00a0some of the\u00a0temporary communities can have the freedom to\u00a0decide to describe themselves by adding Edgeryders as adjective, to describe the origins of their interactions, or the mutualised tools / infrastructure they may use, including the forum.\n\n<span>Also, the\u00a0<strong>Edgeryders</strong> b</span><span>rand is\u00a0</span><strong style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;\">not a culture</strong><span>.\u00a0</span><span>\u00a0It is , again, imho, a online forum, where eventu</span><span>ally some communities may form temporarily. Yes, some of the individuals using the tool may convene on\u00a0using or expressing ( self organized, meritocratic, etc ) cultures in their interactions.\u00a0\n\nEdgeryders is also not a verb ( some may say couchsurfing, for example, may be considered as a verb ).</span>\n\nFrom what I read, some people may want to define Edgeryders as a market ? Between consumers and producers ? \u00a0Personally I hope this is not what we use the attention that converges around the Edgeryders brand and tools for, but if that is what it is used for, then it should be called by a different combination of words, and not simply \"Edgeryders\".\n\nThere can also be various other concepts using Edgeryders as attention and participation aggregator. \u00a0For example, a syndicate. \u00a0 \u00a0Yet the example of a syndicate\u00a0may also require that we are willing to share the political risk of being connected to each other and mutually responsible for each other ( even if only in terms of public image ), if and when it is defined by including the term \"Edgeryders\", with a specific social contract bonding people ?\u00a0And personally this can only be done if and when there is sufficient trust, which for now is mostly superficial, despite the lovely interactions and lovely persons met through the aggregator.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-05 12:07:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:45.567800", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 809, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24311, "user_id": 2448, "topic_id": 4022, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Since Ecobytes also has as top priority to setup a reliable and friendly MTA, and @almereyda already had proposed MailPile, I would like to ask if there is the possibility of joining some resources and working together on this, providing then a solution that is usable for the enlarged federated community of Ecobytes, Edgeryders, etc.\n\nDo you have someone, apart from @almereyda, that could work on this (@alberto seems at least motivated, @danohu)?\n\nIf you agree with this, I suggest building up a multi-skilled team (architects, developers, security experts, users) and driving an own scrum to develop this product, which is essential for a large group of users.

I know I come from an extreme country, where 96% of the people are Poles, and we're all white and catholic - and now imagine even with this huge wave of migration, only some of these people will bring back some good stories of the others. It really makes me wonder that if the stories do not help, if own experiences do not help (wait, I even have a friend living in Brussels who didn't join us on the LOTE evening because it was in Molleenbeck), then how do we make people trust each other and grow a positive, open, supportive, inclusive society?\u00a0\n\nIt is also a challenge to create this environment for meetings that would not feel like encountering something exotic and different due to some voyerist instincts - I used to work in italy for an NGO and we organised human libraries there, but even though it is some sort of step for people to have a chat with migrants from Ghana and Bangladesh, to meet transvestites and gay community members, it felt a little bit like a show.

It's a puzzle.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-07 06:40:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:50.137612", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 303, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22872, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1306, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>The smarts are in the collective</b>\n\nThere is a team, but\u00a0 I would not call it editorial. I was the only one with significant first-hand knowledge of any creative sector (music), and I am gone now. The work was aimed at making Kublai a friendly, welcoming, result-oriented place, and at teaching people how to participate in a constructive conversation. After some months we realized we had a staggering amount of knowledge embedded in the community: from venture capitalist to lawyer, from clown to festival organizer, there was one of practically anything we could think of. Some of the stuff was off-the-scale weird: \"I produce news shows staffed by schoolchildren to educate them to a critical apprach to media\", \"I am running a community kitchen and teaching food design\", \"I have revived a Medieval method for tanning leather using only vegetable-derived materials\", \"I am a sismologist writing a theater play on the great Southern Italian earthquake in 1980\". When you needed a specific skill that was not easily available in the community, we would simply go out and ask for help. Most people will help, if you ask kindly.\n\nSo, you see: the problem was not editorializing, but wiring the community so as to increase the ability of each member to access everyone else's knowledge and skills. We are trying to make Edgeryders one such place, and it is getiing there! :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-23 13:12:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.107401", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 243, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15660, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 5217, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Late June or (preferably) early July</b>\n\nMeeting no 2 in Stockholm.

Despite two degrees in economics, I am still struggling with the concepts, I am not ashamed to tell you. My two cents is that Sepp's account of the history of money is almost completely off the mark, if we are to believe David Graeber's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Debt-First-5-000-Years/dp/1933633867\">influential book</a>. Not sure whether the whole argument falls apart as a consequence, probably not, but a revision might be useful.\n\nAnyway, this is an interesting topic, and I would very much like to be kept in the loop. After all, Edgeryders is all about making policy recommendations to the EU, and I don't see why we should not make some about enabling the creation and circulation of a diverse money ecology, with different currencies following different purposes. Some of that seems to be happening anyway in Europe.\u00a0\n\nThis platform's content feeds into a research effort to identify issues being researched and acted upon by young Europeans.
