But I don't think it's quite that simple. \"Being different\", going by a different value system, is itself entropic. Here's why: to accomplish anything, we humans need other humans. Other humans are attracted by \"successful\" (as per the dominant canon of what \"successful\" means). Moreover, we suffer from a documented psyhological bias called the halo effect, that makes us assume that success trasfers across domains. If you are a successful marathon runner, I will rate higher your\u00a0chances of starting a viable company, even though the skills involved with running marathons are not the same ones needed to run a business. People will help more gladly others when they think they are winners. By doing so, they will increase the chances of success of these perceived winners.\u00a0So, being perceived as successful increases your chances of actually being successful.\u00a0\nThat's not to say you cannot define your own measure of success. But it does mean this is a lot easier when done in tribes. If you inhabit a cluster of the global social graph that goes by different rules, you are kind of OK being different, because your social network is also different, and that means you can mobilize those people to help in whatever it is you are doing. You can enjoy a reasonable measure of social esteem, even if it is localized in your corner of the graph.\u00a0\nAn unfortunate consequence of this is that, the more different you want to be, the more energy\u00a0you need to invest promoting yourself. The message is \"look at me, I am not a failure, I am a success by my own measure\". Social media are full of this, often cloaked in hyper-individualistic narratives, of the \"I quit my day job to follow my dream\" type.

Then it will become a source of local enterprise from the sales of the filter and drops.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nInteresting read:\u00a0http://innovatedevelopment.org/2014/05/13/the-madidrop-an-affordable-easy-to-use-water-purification-tablet\n\n\n\nAccess to potable water is a severe and increasingly pressing issue for countries in the Global South. Due to a confluence of factors including overuse, population growth and climate change, an estimated two-thirds of the world\u2019s population will be living in water-stressed areas by 2025. One recent innovation that could potentially revolutionize water purification in poor, rural communities is the MadiDrop.\n\nThe MadiDrop is a porous ceramic disc that has been infused with silver or copper. When dropped in water, the tablet releases ionic silver or copper that strips away bacteria and pathogens to produce clean, drinkable water. Each tablet is capable of treating 10 to 20 litres of water for up to six months. The result is an affordable, easily distributable and long-lasting alternative for families who lack access to a safe, potable water source.\n\nThe MadiDrop is the second water treatment technology developed by PureMadi, an organization formed by a group of interdisciplinary students from the University of Virginia. Their first project was the creation of a ceramic water filter factory in South Africa. The filters use local labour, readily available materials (clay, sawdust and water) and are treated with a dilute solution of silver nano-particles that effectively filter out common waterborne pathogens. The PureMadi ceramic filters were designed to create a cheap and sustainable point-of-use water purification solution for low-income households. To date, they have been well-received and highly effective among families in Limpopo province, South Africa.\n\nThe impetus for the MadiDrop was to apply this successful model to create an even cheaper point-of-use water treatment technology.

It's somewhat natural, as long as the work is aligned with our mission\u00a0and speaks for itself.\n\nOr:\u00a0Is bioengineering these days\u00a0\u00a0so controversial that you need to be firm about what you are willing / not willing to do and who you're doing it for?\u00a0\n\nI would recommend you read a short piece about selling as a moral act by @lasindias and invite @Juanjo_Pina who is experienced in activist market production\u00a0to give a piece of advice. In the past they were asking if the market is\u00a0the \"ultimate alternative to the enclosure of fresh ideas into the dependence of public money or a way for converting activist into established business people\"?", "created_at": "2017-11-28 14:01:29.638053", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:24:53.073142", "tag_id": 766, "post_id": 7536, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 497}, {"id": 12568, "text": "", "quote": "Hey @Gentlewest let me post a very technical picture here which has lots of stuff in there (we will probably not even need half of that).

On Jamendo.com we could get free music without any legal trouble. Because the mp3 players are relatively simple (you can only go forward or backward by one complete track) one could put the lecture before the music in the same track. So they would have to listen to the lecture before they get to the music. This will be some extra work in the beginning but I think you made a good point. It is possible to do ALL KINDS of sound editing in a program called audacity (http://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/) but I think it would be good to find something more simple.\n\nAnother thing one could offer are more or less educational stories - e.g. for language courses (e.g. from Librivox.com).

Then it will become a source of local enterprise from the sales of the filter and drops.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nInteresting read:\u00a0http://innovatedevelopment.org/2014/05/13/the-madidrop-an-affordable-easy-to-use-water-purification-tablet\n\n\n\nAccess to potable water is a severe and increasingly pressing issue for countries in the Global South. Due to a confluence of factors including overuse, population growth and climate change, an estimated two-thirds of the world\u2019s population will be living in water-stressed areas by 2025. One recent innovation that could potentially revolutionize water purification in poor, rural communities is the MadiDrop.\n\nThe MadiDrop is a porous ceramic disc that has been infused with silver or copper. When dropped in water, the tablet releases ionic silver or copper that strips away bacteria and pathogens to produce clean, drinkable water. Each tablet is capable of treating 10 to 20 litres of water for up to six months. The result is an affordable, easily distributable and long-lasting alternative for families who lack access to a safe, potable water source.\n\nThe MadiDrop is the second water treatment technology developed by PureMadi, an organization formed by a group of interdisciplinary students from the University of Virginia. Their first project was the creation of a ceramic water filter factory in South Africa. The filters use local labour, readily available materials (clay, sawdust and water) and are treated with a dilute solution of silver nano-particles that effectively filter out common waterborne pathogens. The PureMadi ceramic filters were designed to create a cheap and sustainable point-of-use water purification solution for low-income households. To date, they have been well-received and highly effective among families in Limpopo province, South Africa.\n\nThe impetus for the MadiDrop was to apply this successful model to create an even cheaper point-of-use water treatment technology. The MadiDrop can be used in a variety of water storage containers, and at only a few dollars per drop, can provide families with purified water for an extended period of time. Lab results look promising but extensive field testing is still required to determine whether the MadiDrop is a sustainable and culturally appropriate solution. With any luck, the MadiDrop will eventually be widely used to improve clean water access and curb the spread of waterborne diseases in low-income communities.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 14:22:54.392253", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:26:34.228728", "tag_id": 836, "post_id": 710, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 677}, {"id": 13223, "text": "", "quote": "The project will be financed through open contributions.\u00a0 The exact mechanisms for this needs developing and will be somewhat dependent on the corporate form of the project (also in need of development).\u00a0 Ideally people can put money in and take it out as necessary.\n\nSome kind of timed withdrawal, either repayment at fixed time, as loanstock, or a certain amount of notice, would alternative funding to be secured or land to be sold to meet requirement of investors.\n\nPossible models - cooperative issuing loanstock, community share offer, crowd funding", "created_at": "2018-05-22 13:45:48.224973", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:26:34.269862", "tag_id": 2056, "post_id": 4503, "creator_id": 4155, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 4470}, {"id": 27561, "text": "", "quote": "Internet, computers and programming is introduced from birth in our children's lives.

Is it for the student status/visa? Or for the need to receive economic support? If their titles/certificates are at hand (which I presume, since they do not want to enrol in a bachelor, but in a doctorate), why not seeking a professional position (lecturer, lab technician, ...)?

The use of \u201cpeople-first language\u201d* in English aims to \u201cavoid the subconscious dehumanization when discussing people with disabilities\u201d[2]. However, as the researches continue and after we interviewed a few people with disabilities, we soon realized that language is not really a problem. Every person we interviewed all said that the word \u201cdisability\u201d doesn\u2019t bother them at all and they don\u2019t mind being called \u201cdisabled\u201d because it is a fact. (Interview with Raul Krauthausen by @Moriel).\n\nSo here is the question, if the language / term / vocabulary doesn't matter as much as we think, where does the problem really lies?\n\nAnother example would be: why is it okay to say someone has dark hair but not okay to say someone is a gay or someone is a black especially in the western countries? It is because people who used these terms earlier in the history had a strong prejudice and discrimination in mind. In the end, language was created to describe things as how they are. There is nothing wrong with language itself if people don\u2019t think otherwise to begin with.\n\nCould it be that some of us\u2014people without physical disabilities\u2014think that the current terms we use are offensive is because we are subconsciously offending them in the first place? So the question is not how to change the language, or other visible things. The question is how we can change people\u2019s opinion.\u00a0\n\nFor example: use \u201ca person with a vision impairment\u201d instead of \u201ca blind person\u201d\n\n1.http://gait.aidi.udel.edu/gaitlab/cpGuide.html\n\n2.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People-first_language\n\nThis is a group project on going #able with @Moriel, @ChristineOehme and @Luise Kr\u00f6ning", "created_at": "2017-11-28 18:10:22.381728", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:37.228994", "tag_id": 987, "post_id": 694, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 661}, {"id": 12854, "text": "", "quote": "Hello and and a belated welcome, @deborah_ligorio .

It focuses on daughters and sons of immigrants and attempts to raise their social capital by actively using social computing, and uses the most up-to-date communication tools (wikis, blogs, social networks, etc) to reach its audience. It fights for citizenship rights and other fundamental rights and draws challenges for future generations.\n\nIt uses cultural instruments like music (compilation \"Straniero a chi?\" ), books, video spot, National Radio broadcasting \"OndeG2\", fotoromanzo (stories told in pictures), photo exhibitions and websites etc to accompany and sustain the activity and the initiative of Rete G2 in order to obtain a maximum result and thus realize its objective and mission.\n\nAlso very important focus for Rete G2 is the work with schools, both with students and teachers alike on identity, diversity and citizenship rights.\n\nSustainability:\n\nThe original and horizontal way of managing the network allows the project to keep going, and promotes its sustainability. Just as an example, the Sportello Legale online (opened 1st of March 2011) which is promoted by G2 in collaboration with ASGI and Save the Children, is funded by the Department of Equal Opportunities and National Office for Racial Discrimination (UNAR) due to its positive action.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 18:06:48.147709", "updated_at": "2020-09-09 21:08:45.455028", "tag_id": 5402, "post_id": 1515, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1482}, {"id": 12856, "text": "", "quote": "Dear @Noemi.

A natural step up is to get into long-term relationship with one of farmers and combine her/his proficiency and land with enthusiasm and labour of cooperatists. In most developed cases (Freiburg, Germany for example) the cooperative owns the land and some of cooperatists are professional farmers, running the production.

What makes the ailment\u00a0even more intimidating is that the symptoms keep varying\u00a0from person to person and we never know in what way is going to affect the patient. Wave, as our team is called, is trying to make someone suffering from parkinson's and their caregiver's lives easier using technology that we have today at our disposal.\n\nThe first signs of someone having parkinson's are the motor symptoms. These symptoms include essential tremors in hands and other parts of the body. These symptoms further advance overtime enough that it makes it difficult for them to perform the easiest of daily tasks.\u00a0The symptoms occur when the level of dopamine, the chemical responsible for body movement coordination, reduces in the brain. Medication is used to replenish the dopamine levels or fake the action of the dopamine.\n\nWith our prototype, we propose to make the lives of someone with parkinson\u2019s simpler. Our prototype will be wearables that can monitor the motor symptoms of the patient.\u00a0Our prototype will monitor the common symptoms like tremor and stiffness in the human body, and if the symptoms are showing an uncommon behaviour, the prototype can beam the information to the smartphone to remind the patient or the caregiver to take the medicines to or to see the neurologist.\n\n\nParkinson&#39;s Sketch.jpg600x1270 104 KB\n\n\nOur goal is to help someone who has recently started showing symptoms of parkinson\u2019s to track their motor symptoms and also prolong the initial stage as much as possible.\n\nA lot of research-based apps and services are available today that help in better understanding the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s. Apps like mPower and Parkinson\u2019s Central are monitoring the patient\u2019s health from their rdaily movements and tasks along with daily or weekly surveys.

Here, we're talking about a handful of countries being affected, with \"maker countries\" probably unaffected, or at least less affected. So the supply would be there, it's just that you can't pay for it because you're suddenly poor. If that's the case, then maybe some important medications should just be paid for with international solidarity money. How much and how that's handled, I don't know.\n\nMedications could hypothetically go into a spreadsheet, with how many are affected, how much they are affected, how much medication is needed (people x doses), etc. After appropriate sorting, the spreadsheet would give us 3 categories: \"impossible\" (impossible to do here, so we either import them, or we die), \"possible\" (we need to change how we do things, and we should start looking into \"how\" as soon as we can), and \"done\" (we already make them locally, so they are not really an issue).\n\nMy guess is most medications go into the \"impossible\", but we'd need to ask real experts (world-wide) about \"possible\" and \"done\".\n\nFor our exercise, we'd just have to consider the three categories, and asume each is dealt with differently.\n\nIf there's money or if medications are paid for, transport is not the real problem, because these things are not heavy.

In Africa, it is not the same, geeks are hacking to solve a problem, and to help people. 2) the machines that are usually made, are not prototyped in an African context. Although there are exceptions, often they are not useable. Therefore I promote biohacking in Africa in collaboration with electrotechnicians etc., so things can be tested and used. 3) The basic electronic components which are not easily affordable and available in Africa. Even the raspberry pi and Arduino are not easy to get; you have to order it from China.  4) The capitalistic system is another hurdle, because even if the prototype is good, there is standards defined by the WHO so that prototypes or materials to be used in hospitals, should fit with a standard. These standards are defined by the big companies. You cannot, as a biohacker, fight the establishment. They define the standard. This critique is addressed to the system managing health: it does not let people do it themselves. 5) Biohacking is not completely new to Africa, but it remains not supported by African Governments.

Additionally, many market operate a fixed number of stalls: you cannot just add a food cart as you would in other parts of the world. All of this increases the fixed costs of starting an activity. Every year, as the summer comes and festival season kicks in, the police braces to fight off illegal hawkers (who are, for the most part, just people trying to make a living, many of them migrants). The legal ones are very vocal in demanding that the police shuts down their competitors on fairness grounds (\"we have to comply with all these expensive regulations, whereas these guys just go gray economy\").\u00a0\nIn passing: within Europe there are already subastantial regulatory differences. I live in Belgium, and here tiny restaurants with toilets in the basements, that you access through narrow and steep stairs, are very common.

I had never thought of backtracking to the religion wars period in Europe to look for the sources of our own ways of life! This might be because religion was always a non-issue in my native Italy: people are Catholic, full stop.\n\nNow, Catholics come in all sizes and shapes, but that was always assumed to be OK (-ish): just like William of Orange's contemporaries, the Catholic church wants people to observe certain formalities and pay lip service to religion, but it does not actually demand that they really spend their time communing with God and all that. Catholics have a pretty sophisticated way to deal with wayward sheep in the flock: it consists of administering God's forgiveness for one's sins. The price you pay for that, of course, is abiding the formality of the administering: only priests can get God to grant forgiveness, you can't get it on your own. It is very hard to argue seriously with people like that! No, \"three strikes, you are out\", it's almost impossible to get kicked out of the religion. Whatever criticism you come up with, very smart priests will happily agree with you and then tell you that your very critique proves that you are engaged with religion, and therefore, to some extent, religious.\u00a0Being anything other than superficial Catholics in Italy is so hard that most people don't even make the effort.

Is usually delegated to the patients the duty of providing the accurate information about their health condition every visit.\n\n\n\tThe missing digitalization of the gathered health data and the consequent discontinuity of the healing process.\n\n\n\tThe limited precision of the anamnestic research due to the high number of patients and the short time available.\n\n\n\n\n\tFinal User, individuals and\u00a0community target\n\n\n\n\nResQ is conceived to ease the communication among physicians (involved in critical context such as emergency hospitals and refugees reception centers) regarding the health state of foreigner patients who don\u2019t know the language of the hosting country.

Also, the digitalization of such a document would make possible an extensive sharing with colleagues that later will take care of the same patient.\n\nTherefore the physician will have the chance to communicate autonomously among themselves without misunderstanding through the management tool.\n\n\nResQ-board.jpg2045x2500 640 KB\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTechnologies we will adopt\n\n\n\n\nThe tool we are designing will be developed in order to be accessible from the main devices available on the market. Therefore we envision applications possibly developed in their native languages as Java or Android and Objective-C foe iOS ambients.\n\nEven though we believe a mobile tool might be most suitable solution for the specific usage context we are working on, we would like to provide also a multi-platform responsive app developed in HTML5.\n\nThe cloud service might be developed in NodeJS, with database in MongoDB and MySQL.\n\n\n\n\n\tWebsite", "created_at": "2017-11-30 01:15:33.486755", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:48.827814", "tag_id": 1565, "post_id": 866, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 833}, {"id": 13308, "text": "", "quote": "Fast MED is an app designed to simplify the approach that people have with the world of healthcare.\n\nThe user the app is intended for, is a person who is not always comfortable with moving around on their own or which could not have too much familiarity with smartphones.\n\nSuddenly they have a need related to their health, they need for an attention or a medicine but they are not able to move on their own.\n\nThrough this app, with the help of geolocation on a map, the user can:\n\n-call an ambulance with just one tap and advise emergency contact people.\n\n-find doctors available to come to their place;\n\n-locate pharmacies opened at the moment or ask for home delivery;\n\nThe ease of use allows the user to find the service they need as near as possible to them.\n\nDuring the registration the user has to insert some personal details, as personal data, diseases and emergency contact people.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In case of emergency the user, pushing the red button, will ask for an ambulance that will find their present place through the geolocation on the map.

I had never thought of backtracking to the religion wars period in Europe to look for the sources of our own ways of life! This might be because religion was always a non-issue in my native Italy: people are Catholic, full stop.\n\nNow, Catholics come in all sizes and shapes, but that was always assumed to be OK (-ish): just like William of Orange's contemporaries, the Catholic church wants people to observe certain formalities and pay lip service to religion, but it does not actually demand that they really spend their time communing with God and all that. Catholics have a pretty sophisticated way to deal with wayward sheep in the flock: it consists of administering God's forgiveness for one's sins. The price you pay for that, of course, is abiding the formality of the administering: only priests can get God to grant forgiveness, you can't get it on your own. It is very hard to argue seriously with people like that! No, \"three strikes, you are out\", it's almost impossible to get kicked out of the religion. Whatever criticism you come up with, very smart priests will happily agree with you and then tell you that your very critique proves that you are engaged with religion, and therefore, to some extent, religious.\u00a0Being anything other than superficial Catholics in Italy is so hard that most people don't even make the effort.

Then it will become a source of local enterprise from the sales of the filter and drops.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nInteresting read:\u00a0http://innovatedevelopment.org/2014/05/13/the-madidrop-an-affordable-easy-to-use-water-purification-tablet\n\n\n\nAccess to potable water is a severe and increasingly pressing issue for countries in the Global South. Due to a confluence of factors including overuse, population growth and climate change, an estimated two-thirds of the world\u2019s population will be living in water-stressed areas by 2025. One recent innovation that could potentially revolutionize water purification in poor, rural communities is the MadiDrop.\n\nThe MadiDrop is a porous ceramic disc that has been infused with silver or copper. When dropped in water, the tablet releases ionic silver or copper that strips away bacteria and pathogens to produce clean, drinkable water. Each tablet is capable of treating 10 to 20 litres of water for up to six months. The result is an affordable, easily distributable and long-lasting alternative for families who lack access to a safe, potable water source.\n\nThe MadiDrop is the second water treatment technology developed by PureMadi, an organization formed by a group of interdisciplinary students from the University of Virginia. Their first project was the creation of a ceramic water filter factory in South Africa. The filters use local labour, readily available materials (clay, sawdust and water) and are treated with a dilute solution of silver nano-particles that effectively filter out common waterborne pathogens. The PureMadi ceramic filters were designed to create a cheap and sustainable point-of-use water purification solution for low-income households. To date, they have been well-received and highly effective among families in Limpopo province, South Africa.\n\nThe impetus for the MadiDrop was to apply this successful model to create an even cheaper point-of-use water treatment technology. The MadiDrop can be used in a variety of water storage containers, and at only a few dollars per drop, can provide families with purified water for an extended period of time. Lab results look promising but extensive field testing is still required to determine whether the MadiDrop is a sustainable and culturally appropriate solution. With any luck, the MadiDrop will eventually be widely used to improve clean water access and curb the spread of waterborne diseases in low-income communities.", "created_at": "2017-11-30 02:10:19.508629", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:31:56.024416", "tag_id": 1843, "post_id": 710, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 677}, {"id": 22066, "text": "", "quote": "he human rights, the technology, medicine, preservation, everything is more advanced than ever before and progressing and developing at a faster speed.", "created_at": "2020-08-27 14:43:01.690871", "updated_at": "2020-08-27 14:43:17.165174", "tag_id": 6212, "post_id": 55291, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 10030}, {"id": 22071, "text": "", "quote": "gender-based violence", "created_at": "2020-08-27 15:08:20.365485", "updated_at": "2020-08-27 15:08:29.587042", "tag_id": 1823, "post_id": 61746, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 11193}, {"id": 22073, "text": "", "quote": "gender-based violence", "created_at": "2020-08-27 15:08:42.518922", "updated_at": "2020-08-27 15:08:49.378761", "tag_id": 885, "post_id": 61746, "creator_id": 5059, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 11193}, {"id": 13116, "text": "", "quote": "The concept of genomic integrity, basically including all the molecular genetic details of cells,\u00a0was developed in about 2009 as a means to encourage public awareness of the many things we can choose to avoid doing, for our health. \u00a0 Thus, prevention (to\u00a0avoid health care issues) rather than actual care is my key passion. \u00a0The non-profit association AGiR!

I call these meetings \"Circles of openness\".\u00a0\n\nSome of the meetings were extremely fruitful and transformative. Others were okay and sometimes a bit boring. What determined the quality of the meetings was the openess and willingness to share from an honest and authentic place, and to really be curious to share what feels exciting and challenging to someone. During the meetings where the mayority of the participants was willing to listen and feel into what's relevant at that time, there was a magical openness and connection among the group. I truly enjoyed these meetings and they were one of the most beautiful shared moments of my life. What I also enjoyed is the power to transform through awareness. By expressing a doubt or a challenge and openly looking at it, it became possible to take distance from the perspective and let go of it. Also the awareness of the group seemed to stimulate and hold space for sharing these vulnerable perspectives.\u00a0\n\nWhat didn't work so well was:\n\n\nwhen people spoke in general terms and theoretically/ hypothetically without really feeling the question.\u00a0\nwhen people didn't really want to be there\n\n\nWhat did work well was:\u00a0\n\n\nsharing from your own experience\nlistening and asking questions to explore the perspective\nholding space: being open to the perspective without taking it personally, listening with from an open space\nusing a talking stick, so one could speak at the time.\u00a0\na good host and facilitator who's comfortable with (almost) everything and ready to set some guidelines, such as: speaking from the heart, speaking from your personal experience, no interuptions and the talking stick.\u00a0\n\n\nIn my experience these circles of openness help build relationships of trust and create a vital space for transformation.\u00a0\n\nLet me know if you want to find out more.

As the old man in this corner of the Edgeryders community, I feel it is my duty to say that the vast majority of people lived in rented dwellings up until the 1980s (in most European countries but not in America). The idea of mass ownership of homes was, according to historians, Thatcher's: she wanted more people to be ideologically tied in with the haves, or something to that effect. Apparently, her administration thought\u00a0 that a society of home owners would be more invested (literally) in the status quo. They turned out to be mostly right.\n\nAnyway, my point is that before that time people did have families, and they did not feel particularly flaky, quite the contrary. So I would submit that the perceived stability of a familial arrangement has little to do with home ownership. Maybe an important factor is, rather, the rigidity of the agreement that binds it members together: practically indestructible in the case of parent-to-offspring, solid but less committal in\u00a0 that of sibling-to-sibling, more instable in that of life partner-to-life partner, and even more in that of the housemate-to-housemate.", "created_at": "2017-11-28 18:03:34.661523", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:33:40.585279", "tag_id": 962, "post_id": 19317, "creator_id": 3791, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 1405}, {"id": 14403, "text": "", "quote": "Other than that, there are more collaborative housing initiatives going on right now:\n\n\n\n\n\nin Brussels - a social, cultural repurposing of a commercial building space\n\n\n\nOpenOca in Italy\n\n\n\nEarthSky Lab in Portugal, by @vvorski and @Fotona", "created_at": "2018-08-03 22:26:21.205503", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 08:33:40.631167", "tag_id": 962, "post_id": 16642, "creator_id": 4155, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 5685}, {"id": 18575, "text": "", "quote": "Ne, net\u011b\u0161\u00edm, cht\u011bl bych pracovat co nejd\u00e9le, proto\u017ee vid\u00edm v pr\u00e1ci smysl.

I left my hometown 14 years ago and I have been reconstructing my social world since then. I think the 'home bubbles' and the 'abroad bubbles' have always been fluid for me - 'home' and 'abroad' have blurry boundaries. Even in my darkest, least hopeful moments, when it felt like I didn't have a home anymore or a language that feels like home, I tried to remind myself that I left Romania for NYC because I was curious to learn about the world. This is also the reason for which I try to keep my bubbles porous - I believe that if I want to learn with others I cannot live in the comfort of a cozy space. My struggle has been to deconstruct ideas that society takes for granted - that 'home' needs to be a stable space, a comfortable one, a space of predictability and intimacy (hence my interest in co-housing). But most homes are not like that or, more accurately, they are like that only in the simplified narratives we create about them. From my experience, there is a lot of hard work involved in building a home both 'at home' and 'abroad'. So, it is this hard work of making a home that keeps me sane because I know that, if I am honest with myself, wherever I go I will have to engage in it. This realization has saved me from cultural shocks and the disappointment with old or new friends. Of course, some days it feels easier to fall back on given narratives about homes and homelands...but those days pass. More difficult is losing friends because of such relocations in space but then again friendships are dialogues and some dialogues end or morph into something else. I guess, I find my wellbeing in trying to stay curious, kind and open to the world around me even when I don't feel like it or when the world around doesn't seem particularly kind to me (poetry helps too) :)\n        \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      Cancel\nSave\n    \n  \nAnnotate", "created_at": "2019-11-15 17:03:05.090360", "updated_at": "2020-08-27 16:27:48.947862", "tag_id": 5050, "post_id": 64081, "creator_id": 3323, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9369}, {"id": 22091, "text": "", "quote": "Spotka\u0142am si\u0119 z przemoc\u0105 psychiczn\u0105 w miejscu pracy.\nDawajcie pomys\u0142y, jak broni\u0107 si\u0119 przed zostaniem ofiar\u0105.\nDawajcie pomys\u0142y, co robi\u0107, \u017ceby oddolnie zapobiega\u0107 mobbingowi w naszym otoczeniu.", "created_at": "2020-08-27 22:37:33.883020", "updated_at": "2020-08-27 22:37:33.883020", "tag_id": 7106, "post_id": 53648, "creator_id": 6484, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9931}, {"id": 22092, "text": "", "quote": "Kiedy sko\u0144czy\u0142am studia, mia\u0142am dosy\u0107 unikatow\u0105 wiedz\u0119 i umiej\u0119tno\u015bci  w tym obszarze.", "created_at": "2020-08-27 22:37:53.395236", "updated_at": "2020-08-27 22:37:53.395236", "tag_id": 950, "post_id": 53648, "creator_id": 6484, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9931}, {"id": 22093, "text": "", "quote": "(Pisz\u0105c to zacz\u0119\u0142am si\u0119 trz\u0105\u015b\u0107, wi\u0119c chyba nie chc\u0119 sobie wi\u0119cej i bardziej szczeg\u00f3\u0142owo przypomina\u0107, szczeg\u00f3lnie, \u017ce najgorsze wspomnienia jeszcze przede mn\u0105.)", "created_at": "2020-08-27 22:39:51.150044", "updated_at": "2020-08-27 22:39:51.150044", "tag_id": 6196, "post_id": 53648, "creator_id": 6484, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9931}, {"id": 22101, "text": "", "quote": "Jednak to co \u0142\u0105czy przejawy seksizmu", "created_at": "2020-08-27 22:46:34.351949", "updated_at": "2020-08-27 22:46:34.351949", "tag_id": 1523, "post_id": 57291, "creator_id": 6484, "type": "AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation", "topic_id": 9931}, {"id": 22103, "text": "", "quote": "Ostatnio mia\u0142em rozkmin\u0119 na temat selekcji  ludzi przeprowadzonej przez rz\u0105d w czasach PRL i zdominowaniu tym samym rynku, \u017cycia przez tych bogatszych/lepszych/zdrowszych.

Potem by\u0142o lepiej, ale pani profesor stwierdzi\u0142a, \u017ce jednak trzeba naci\u0105\u0107 t\u0119 pier\u015b. Po\u0142o\u017cy\u0142a mnie do szpitala z za\u0142o\u017ceniem, \u017ce natnie pier\u015b, oczy\u015bci j\u0105  i b\u0119d\u0119 mog\u0142a wr\u00f3ci\u0107 do karmienia. Ju\u017c przed zabiegiem sugerowano, \u017cebym zaprzesta\u0142a laktacj\u0119 i zaproponowano mi lek, k\u00f3rego skutki uboczne to np.: udar m\u00f3zgu, zawa\u0142 serca, padaczka. Zacz\u0119\u0142am go bra\u0107 w szpitalu. Piel\u0119gniarki nie ogarnia\u0142y czy leki zosta\u0142y mi podane czy nie. Tak naprawd\u0119 sama musia\u0142am kontrolowa\u0107 jakie leki, w jakiej dawce dostaj\u0119. Chirurg, kt\u00f3ry mia\u0142 nacina\u0107 pier\u015b, zapyta\u0142 czy chcia\u0142abym karmi\u0107. Na co odpowiedzia\u0142am, \u017ce je\u015bli daje mi na to nadziej\u0119: to tak, bardzo chcia\u0142abym karmi\u0107. Nie wyt\u0142umaczy\u0142 mi nic. Naci\u0105\u0142 mi pier\u015b na granicy otoczki, przez co nie mia\u0142am mo\u017cliwo\u015bci odci\u0105gania mleka laktatorem. Gdyby naci\u0105\u0142 j\u0105 3 cm wy\u017cej, proces gojenia i powrotu do laktacji by\u0142by du\u017co prostszy. Wszyscy lekarze w szpitalu twierdzili, \u017ce pier\u015b trzeba banda\u017cowa\u0107 i musz\u0119 jak najszybciej zako\u0144czy\u0107 laktacj\u0119, \u017ceby rana si\u0119 zagoi\u0142a. Dosta\u0142am w tym czasie depresji, bo karmienie jest dla mnie bardzo wa\u017cne. Na szcz\u0119\u015bcie na mojej drodze stan\u0119\u0142a doradczyni laktacyjna, kt\u00f3ra przedstawi\u0142a mi badania naukowe: od 12 lat w innych miastach w Polsce ropie\u0144 piersi jest leczony bez zaprzestania laktacji. W szpitalu zg\u0142asza\u0142am zawroty g\u0142owy i z\u0142y stan psychiczny, bo mleko przesta\u0142o lecie\u0107 w moich piersiach. Nikt si\u0119 tym nie przej\u0105\u0142. Doradczyni laktacyjna powiedzia\u0142a, \u017ce je\u015bli jej zaufam, wr\u00f3c\u0119 do karmienia. Zaj\u0119\u0142o to ok. dw\u00f3ch tygodni. Od razu odstawi\u0142am te lekarstwa. Zacz\u0119\u0142am bra\u0107 zio\u0142a i robi\u0107 wizualizacje tego, \u017ce karmi\u0119 naturalnie. Po dw\u00f3ch tygodniach przystawi\u0142am dziecko do piersi. Karmi\u0142am na pocz\u0105tku w opatrunku. Pier\u015b goi\u0142a si\u0119 miesi\u0105c. No, ale si\u0119 uda\u0142o. To jest te\u017c dow\u00f3d na to, \u017ce lekarze s\u0105 niewykszta\u0142ceni na poziomie profesorskim. Doktor przyzna\u0142a, \u017ce zajmuje si\u0119 bardziej operacjami plastycznymi ni\u017c laktacj\u0105. O to mam \u017cal do naszej s\u0142u\u017cby zdrowia, \u017ce nie dbaj\u0105 kompletnie o pacjenta. Dla dzieci mam lekark\u0119 prowadz\u0105c\u0105 w publicznej plac\u00f3wce. Wieczorem, gdy jest sytuacja kryzysowa, umawiamy si\u0119 z ni\u0105 czasem prywatnie. Ginekologicznie korzysta\u0142am z mojej lekarki na NFZ, natomiast badania typu USG ci\u0105\u017cy wykonywa\u0142am prywatnie ze wzgl\u0119du na okres oczekiwania i na to jak si\u0119 zwracano do mnie w trakcie tego badania. pan na pierwszym USG stwierdzi\u0142, \u017ce ma za s\u0142aby sprz\u0119t, nie jest w stanie zbada\u0107 mi przezierno\u015bci karku i sugeruje wizyt\u0119 prywatn\u0105 na lepszym sprz\u0119cie. Takie badanie mo\u017cna wykona\u0107 do 2 tygodni. Gdybym by\u0142a w pierwszej ci\u0105\u017cy i nie mia\u0142a pieni\u0119dzy, prawdopodobnie by\u0142abym w du\u017cym stresie i nie wiedzia\u0142abym gdzie si\u0119 uda\u0107.

This box was the product of a very specific way to produce software as a product using \u201cwaterfall methodologies\u201d. In waterfall methods, you start with the requirements from the clients, once you have those, you go to your developer team and start turning those requirements into a specification and a design of a machine to be developed. This whole process was slow, like one or two years, and after that you would emerge and pass what you developed back to the client. You would test it with the client to see if it worked. And, ideally it all worked and you were done.Or, for example with Microsoft, every two to three years a new release of the operating system would be offered. They would go through a similar cycle for each version, and come back in 2-3 years with a new version of the operating system, or other software like Microsoft Office. Once it was ready, you would release the code and put it on a disk to get sold. Once code was released, changes were difficult, so that release date was a big moment and the end of a production cycle. Today, we do not buy boxes, but open up a browser window to access most software. We access Facebook, Google search or Google Docs, and a host of other \u201cservices\u201d instead of installing them on our computers. With services the code is on a server. The user connects to the server to get the functionality. This is what happens with a web browser.This subtle shift has completely changed how software is produced and how the software industry functions.
