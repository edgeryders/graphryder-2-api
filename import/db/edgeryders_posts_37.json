I even considered introducing the study of environmental chemistry instead of standard chemistry, but that didn't work out. But this kind of citizen science would bring great life to teaching, as well as helping adults take control of their own lives. I was fascinated by the citizen science aspect of the Festival as a whole.\n\nWhat comes through your posts beautifully, @rachel, is the dimension of knowledge, experience and care (in the sense of being careful, rather than the other vital sense of caring for each other). The technology is secondary. Your posts here suggest that attention to the detail in the process is much more significant than, say, the difference between using a domestic pressure cooker rather than an official autoclave for sterilization.\n\nThere's something here too that is shared between citizen science and open source software. It is that it is quite easy in principle to involve ordinary people in ordinary situations, without great amounts of expensive technology or large organisations.\n\nBack to schools, though. How can we get these ideas, and practices, into mainstream secondary education? Perhaps through, first, alternative education and home schoolers sharing resources? If we did manage to get into mainstream education, that would be such a powerful springboard into the hearts and minds of young people. \n\nIn the UK, we can perhaps benefit in an unexpected way from present trends. There are still large numbers of standard council-controlled schools, but increasing numbers of free schools and \"academies\". While these are perhaps set up to allow private interests to profit from education (very distasteful), they can also be used to break free of some norms, and maybe experiment with this kind of idea.", "created_at": "2017-11-03 12:57:49.776962", "updated_at": "2017-11-03 12:57:49.776962", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 294, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [38966], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38838, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7569, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Matt, your clarity and learning never ceases to amaze me.\n\nHowever:\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:2, topic:7569\"]\nThe idea is that those who have the currency have an interest to keep the transactions honest, instead of allowing theft, double spending or inflation to occur, all of which would erode the reputation and / or monetary base of the cryptocurrency.\n[/quote]\n\nThis does not seem like a very safe idea.

I do see Russia and China striving to destabilize western alliances.  Speaking as an American, I don't really get why Trump is so enamoured of Russia other than the fact that it was they who bailed out his bankrupt company. With China we are enablers because despite railing against global markets, we send most of our money to them by buying the stuff they make for our consumer-driven lifestyle.\n\nIt should be noted that most Americans do not want Trump and reject his message.  But the system here (which on the national level is not at all a democracy despite our collective conceit) is such that the people who insist on this new form of isolationism maintain a kind of stranglehold on the national government.  And of course it remains to be seen if anyone can make a convincing cad to reverse this momentum.  Obama did.  But who now?\n\nI understand the economic reasons for the EU, and while I despair at seeing the retrenching of dangerous nationalist trends, I always thought one of the greatest and most inspiring aspects of it is how European countries,all of whom waged war with each other since the Roman Empire, chose to not just stop but to go so far as to share the same money.

Through Get Online Week we hope to spread these ideas in Egypt and the region! Activities will be launched both <strong>online and offline </strong>to promote the role of ICT in development, showcase innovative initiatives and engage youth, private sector and CSOs in discussions and knowledge exchange.\u00a0\n\nThe scope of collaboration will encompass a variety of activities that will engage our communities ranging from <strong>ICT awareness sessions, trainings, workshops, onlined debates, webinars, roundtable discussion on Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurship as well as a final event 'Innovation and Creativity for Development' on the 27th of March at El Sawy Culture Wheel.</strong>\u00a0Get Online Week activities are not limited to the latter, the main goal is to find <strong>creative ways </strong>to integrate our societies into the digital world.\u00a0\n\nWe think Get Online Week would be a great platform to <strong>promote Spot the Future,</strong> so we suggest that we include a<strong> webinar </strong>or a short video presentation about Spot the Future as one of our activities! We will post them on the Get Online Week website and Facebook page (mind you they're still a working progress; should be completed and active by next week, I'll share the links once they're ready) as well as our UNDP Egypt social media outlets! This would be a very creative way to promote Spot the Future as well as engage those interesting innovators we're looking for! It can be used by all the Country Offices to promote the initiative, not just for Get Online Week! The videos on the Edgeryders website are great!\n\nWe would also like to create a <strong>cool infograph</strong> which simply summarizes what Spot the Future is, visual mechanisms are always the most effective! <strong>All we need from Edgeryders is the content for the infograph, very simple and brief info and our designer will make one</strong>\n\nI will provide you with a detailed agenda and the links by next week! and I'll update you on what's going on as we go...\n\n<strong>What do you guys think??</strong>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-13 12:26:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:13.514749", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 509, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 35.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 1856, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45534, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 8431, "post_number": 18, "raw": "Thanks for this @Alberto, things have been busy lately and I appreciate you pushing this forward. \n\nCan do.

Thank you for giving it a stab! Here is some early feedback. My first impression is that it could be simplified a lot. In fact, I made some changes already. \n\nMy main idea:\n\n1. In the `Budget` tab, get rid of columns A and I to L. If we need Subtotals (which would be nice, and seems to have been the thinking behind column A), we'll probably need a better solution \u2013 let's talk about it in voice.\n\n2. Move the `Cash journal` to the `Budget` tab. There should be a \"predicted date of payment\" column (only one: earliest, main and latest are overkill). This feeds the cash flow predictor.\n\n3. The predicted money in should probably be in the `Overview` tab. We never had more than four (active) invoices for one project, so in the Overview tab we input the financial consideration: how much do we get, when we get it.\n\n4. The \"Paid\" checkbox should probably go. Remember, the idea is that you know how much money has been spent on a project by looking it up _in Freeagent_, which is  the authoritative record.\n\n5. The form-filling in the `Overview tab` seems excessive. No, I am not going to input a description of the project. This will be available on the contract, on the platform etc. I suggest we go over it and decide what is absolutely necessary and kill all the rest.\n\n6.

We find that longitudinal social networking patterns and word usage predict creative performance. We collected the e-mail archives of 60 members of a community of researchers working on 12 projects improving various aspects of the daily lives of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease. Our results indicate that more creative projects show a decrease in group density, while more actors are involved, and more e-mails are exchanged, suggesting that a more successful project attracts more attention from many different people. We also found that members of more creative projects use more outspoken language, which gets more focused over time.\n\n\nGiven that multiple reviewers ask that we review the entries that we can't get access to, I think we need to account for it in some way. I think given that across all of our institutions we can't get ahold of it, it's not terrible to mention in the letter to reviewers that we couldn't get access. I think it's better than seeming to ignore their suggestions.

This stuff should be in the Commission's language.\n\n### A philosophical point: time vs. deliverables\n\nIn order not to create too much overhead, we have so far negotiated with people that they complete tasks, which normally result in deliverables. We are not really buying their time: we telling them: \"we want you to do X. We are prepared to pay you Y, which corresponds to Z% of your FTE\". We do not care if the person really uses all the hours/days allocated, as long as she completes the task to our standards of quality. \n\nThe EC thinks in time. So, we still request people to provide timesheets. The timesheets for each person must run up to the Z% of FTE she sold us. But that is NOT \"billable time\", the reason for which the FA reporting system was created.   Time is not billable. As long as this is understood, I'm happy with the system proposed. \n\n###Miscellaneous\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:6, topic:9143\"]\nit will be used rarely of course since most indirect costs will appear in the core project, not related to a single project.

Sunday afternoon :disappointed:). \n\nThat said, my contribution is: \n\n* I agree with your main conclusion. One pair is what we should do. Who chooses it, and when? This has direct implications on the reading list, which consists of the SF work(s) that does advanced speculation on the concept, and one or two Econ references on its textbook treatment.\n* I would encourage both Malka and Raffaele to think more in terms of message to be delivered than of time. If time is short, I would give more space to the presentations than to the Q&A. For this type of thing, I think many people will need some time to listen in puzzled silence before they can go participatory and interactive. \n* I would prefer Malka and Raffaele to make the choice. Specifically, I think the choice criterion is this: choose the pair that (a) generates the weirdest, most novel fictional economy, while (b) it is still possible to build intellectual bridges from known economics to get there. In the case of _Walkaway_, the main ramp to the bridge seems to be the Coase theorem (but there are others, from behavioral economics to value theory). It is very important that Raffaele's econ arsenal does not completely glitch! Another, probably weaker critierion is (c) that the risulting fictional economy is attractive, utopian more than dystopian. \n* That said, if either of you needs a sounding board, I'm here.

In another topic I made the comment that commitment brings to mind the image, \"burn your ships.\"  Not to take this metaphor too far, but that was what Cortez did after landing in Mexico.  So, it's not the most pleasant image given what happened after that.  But the point is the level of commitment.  \n\nSoon enough the commitment of every person involved will be tested.  Some will go and some will stay.  And in the process, you usually see that some people do much more work than others.  I bet just about everyone reading this has seen a version of this, maybe in a college living situation or apartment sharing with a group.  \n\nIn a capitalist society hard work is rewarded with money.  But what if you pool your money?  How do you then deal with the reality that some work more than others, some are less satisfied with the condition of \"the vibes\" within the group and some will want to avoid dealing with things if they involve conflict or disagreement (until something blows up), and some will prefer \"hanging out\" to working on the group's energy and some will prefer to just go into their bedroom and shut the door.\n\nAdd to that the fact that some pairings, trios, groups, etc. have better chemistry than others.  Sometimes you get lucky and everyone just loves to be together, work hard, share, have fun, etc.  But most of the time you get a mix.  So, within a relatively committed group, what do you do about the relationships that need \"work\"?  \n\nYou work on it.  For me, and this is something I say with online communities too, the key is to find something to like in the other person - almost doesn't matter what it is - and focus on that until you can spread that \"liking\" to other areas.  That plus simply talking things through, esp when that talk is difficult.  If everyone shares a goal of clarity understanding and compassion, it is amazing sometimes how that chemistry can be improved.  Do not seek conflict but do not avoid it.  Rather, treat it as an opportunity to get to a deeper understanding.  I say chemistry \"can be\" improved - not \"will be.\"  It's a journey where one does not know all aspects of the territory before entering it.\n\nAnd even if you commit totally, it might not mean that you are going to be there with those people forever.

As never before in history, sophisticated financial products\u00a0have been made the object of a veritable torrent of innovation; some of it comes from core operators themselves (derivative instruments of various kinds), and it fully accepts the logic of seeking for the highest return given the risk level; other from \"fringe operators\" (the social finance/impact investment scene) aiming at introducing goals other than yield per risk level in finance; other still from the \"non operators\" of hacker finance (crypto currencies, social currencies, network bartering algorithms, moneyless and non-transactional economies), who are strongly critical of finance as it is and aim to disrupt it or, at least, unmoor themselves from a system they don't trust.\n\nMarket Clearing is a conversation aimed at kickstarting a dialogue across all these different scenes of financial innovators. With it, we are making a small investment in each other. We believe it is a good one, because it's like buying an option: the costs are small and certain (attending the conference), the payoff of working together can be very high. Market Clearing's ultimate goal is to reboot financial\u00a0and credit instruments as positive contributors to a humane, well-functioning society; for this first iteration, it sets for itself the goal of singling out promising areas for interdisciplinary collaboration across money geeks within and without the financial sector.\n\nMarket Clearing originates in the hacker scene and embraces hacker culture, but welcomes everyone with an interest in the topic and an open mind. You can sport your branded suit just as well as cargo pants and bandana, as long as you are prepared to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. In the course of Market Clearing you will:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Explore the latest development in financial innovation \u2013 how they work, and what kind of society they are trying to advance.</li>\n\n<li>Share your own expertise \u2013 no spectators allowed!</li>\n\n<li>Participate in honest, open discussion about the way forward.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nMarket Clearing takes place in [date and location of next lote event]. It is nested within the Living On The Edge \u00a0conference; so it inherits both its edgy, exciting venue and the support of its global community of changemakers gathered around Edgeryders.\n\n<h3>What we need to make it happen</h3>\n\nMore or less:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Format: some talks to kickoff, then facilitated seminars (5 to 20 people a group)</li>\n\n<li>One keynote speaker, to be co-selected with a partner. Top-tier names are very expensive; second-tier names are quite possible. By this I mean venture capitalists (legion), impact investments people (Big Society Capital? Karl Richter, possibly too small?) and possibly hacker finance people (somebody from the BitCoin community?). Small fee (1000?) + travel, about 1500 in all.</li>\n\n<li>Two featured speakers (no fee, funded travel) to represent points of view on finance and communities other than the keynote speaker. About 1000 in all.</li>\n\n<li>One facilitator/rapporteur to the plenary \u00a0500 fee + 300 travel.</li>\n\n<li>One person in charge of documentation.

I have read the call to action, but I'm not sure I understand what he actually wants to build. I think there is also some deeper thinking that has to be integrated as to not run into dead ends. Tools for online collaboration follow roughly the same \"rules\" as hardware tools:\n\n* Generalised tools that do many things are usually not high-powered enough to take on difficult jobs.\n* High-powered tools that can be customised to do specific and complex jobs very well usually have a steep learning curve.\n\nI would like to turn one of his assumptions around:\n\n> As long as at least one person is not comfortable with it, using it would mean excluding someone from the group.

No one should be excluded from participating in the collective.\n\nI think this sets the bar really low for pushing forward the ways in which we collaborate. People are not impossible to teach. About 14 months ago, I introduced Loomio to the Borderland community. A year ago, almost to the day, I had this [discussion about fear of exclusivity](https://talk.theborderland.se/d/ksALyR5t/is-talk-too-exclusive-) of the platform. I also had some resistance on the Facebook group. My response to this was trying even harder to post links to important discussions to the Borderland Facebook group, and now I very rarely hear this sort of complaint. People have become accustomed to the tool, but that required some stubbornness on my part. A year later, our participation rate in decisions is way, way above what it has ever been before.\n\nBy pushing for a new and better way to collaborate, you might loose some people, but you might include others. For example, when moving to Loomio from Facebook, we \"lost\" most of the trolling participants in our decision making and gained a whole bunch of people who really liked being given a non-commercial and progressive platform to collaborate on.\n\nAnyway, I'm really interested to see where this goes.", "created_at": "2019-02-12 14:57:17.099451", "updated_at": "2019-02-12 14:57:17.099451", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 403, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [50773], "is_reply_to": [50773], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50835, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 9483, "post_number": 9, "raw": "```\n\n\n\nSounds good, we could also invite some of the solarpunk/cancel the apocalypse guys from re:Publica last year: https://18.re-publica.com/en/topics/cancel-apocalypse \nand make some sort of artistic and activist blend of ideas on post-postapocalyptic visions of the future, sustainable and inclusive cities with new kinds of aesthetics, and a game as a learning methodology.", "created_at": "2019-02-12 17:18:28.943195", "updated_at": "2019-02-12 17:18:28.943195", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 62, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 68.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 347], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50888, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9494, "post_number": 4, "raw": "[quote=\"noemi, post:2, topic:9494\"]\nthis is obviously not the case now that the projects started and we know each other.\n[/quote]\n\n\nExactly, thanks for making this point.

At that first conference we explored our collective future through the lens of collapse and sustained austerity - despite the relative stability since then in Northern Europe, potential and real crisis remains in our midst.\n\nIn the spirit of staying with the trouble, <strong>LOTE5</strong> will see a return to our early roots in order to examine what we have achieved since then, with a step closer to the edge, with the time that has past since our early visions we have experimented and prototyped; unMonastery, Makerfox, hexayurts, new organisational forms and we propose that now is the time for a meaningful road test of that infrastructure under conditions that require it\u2019s creation, with an open invitation to new collaborators to join us in structuring a useful constellation of resources in the LOTE5 Survival Village. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\nThe Scene</h3>\n\nSince the beginning of this year over 27,000 migrants and asylum seekers have arrived in Greece, the majority of whom are fleeing from the war in Syria. With the fallout of escalating global conflict beating at the shores of Europe, above and beyond potential economic collapse Greece has become a flashpoint and meeting place for humanitarian confrontation between principles and reality-.\n\nDespite such dire implications and the depiction of Greece in mainstream international media as something approaching a failed state, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@unmonastery/how-we-got-here-8f463dc81920\">experience on the ground</a> and at the edge indicates otherwise; Athens houses an immense network of organisations and initiatives that are focused on improving the social good and building a resilient commons.\n\nAs part of unMonastery\u2019s work in Athens we have begun to connect, work with and begin to support some of these long standing and emergent networks. Between the hackerspace SatNogs project, the Spithari eco settlement, Senait\u2019s Kitchen, SciFy\u2019s technology for all initiatives and the recent Adhocracy exhibition there exists an enormous capacity to configure new forms of distributed infrastructure and support for a rapidly changing situation. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\nThe (distributed) Architecture\u00a0</h3>\n\nAs the starting point of LOTE5 we propose the deployment of all our existing infrastructure projects, this will serve as a point of initiation for invitations to both Greek based and international initiatives focused on distributed infrastructure.\n\nHexayurts are the brainchild of long standing community member Vinay Gupta, which will act as a core space for activities, with even a small cluster of 20 or so guaranteed to be highly visible for both photo opps and surveillance satellites. \u00a0These will be constructed and inaugurated by the participants as they arrive, with each yurt housing both us and our deepest concerns. \u00a0\n\nIf possible the conference can also operate as a testing ground for Makerfox, an alternate economic exchange unit, which will form the foundation for all collaboration on site. Following last year\u2019s LOTE#4 triumph of an on-site co-operative kitchen, unMonastery Athens successful pop-up kitchen led by Senait will be recruited to coordinate food supplies: \u2018Them that does the chopping, eats the dinner.\u2019\n\nOnce we have established reasonable conditions for meaningful dialogue, the stage will be set for a series of questions about organisational form, governance and future endeavour. \u00a0We propose a loving polemic between representatives of a selection of parallel communities that have trudged along this path before us. \u00a0The goal for the unMonastery is to then choose and refine the most promising model to suit an ever more complex organisational challenge.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\">\n\nPracticalities</h3>\n\n<strong>Location:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tAthens</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Possible dates:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tweekend of Sept 25.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Funding sources:</strong>\n\nWe have opened discussions with ADDMA (Athens Mayor\u2019s Office), the British Council, the Goethe Institute and other potential institutional actors and collaborators\n\n<strong>Obtainable Objective(s):</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\trevisit radical roots of ER</li>\n\n<li>\t\tacquire practical skills (how to build a survival camp)</li>\n\n<li>\t\tdevelop rituals to fill the temporary structures with life</li>\n\n<li>\t\tdiscussion on distributed organisations, ownership, etc</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Hidden Assumption(s):</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\ttactile, tangible work epitomises the spirit of efforts</li>\n\n<li>\t\ta visible Edgeryders is a viable Edgeryders</li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2015-05-23 15:08:35", "updated_at": "2018-05-28 14:29:38.206209", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1016, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551, 1856, 2580], "is_private": false}, {"id": 53943, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 9942, "post_number": 10, "raw": "On the topic of worth checking out for some comunity members, esspecailly those in the UK might be this https://edgeryders.eu/t/art-and-blockchain-daowo-distributed-autonomous-organisations-with-others-summit-uk/9934 event combining discussions around blockchain,art and knowledge sharing.", "created_at": "2019-05-24 17:22:38.587043", "updated_at": "2019-05-24 17:22:38.587043", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 44, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 24.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [53942], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54038, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9942, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Beautiful, must read post is this:\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/mobbing-czy-slowa-sa-w-stanie-oddac-doswiadczenia/9931\n\nIt's the story of a Polish woman working in the IT sector who has faced harrassment at work (by men colleagues and superiors).

How did you know the multiples of first ten whole numbers? If you studied in a private school in Nepal like I did, you probably were made to mug the multiples. <em>THREE ONES ARE THREE. FIVE NINES ARE FORTY FIVE.</em> I did not clearly know what the sentence structure meant. If you ever saw a cross between 5 and 9, you had to be able to say 45 without thinking. That\u2019s how I learned my multiples. It took a lot of time to learn the multiples, even more than most of my class mates, even though I was a \u201cgood\u201d student in Mathematics.\n\nThere are three apples in a basket. There are two apples in another basket. If we put all these apples in a basket, there will be five apples. That was addition. I think I understood addition easily then. Now, multiplication was tougher and division seemed way beyond my level.\n\nNow, instead of two baskets of apples with two and three apples respectively, say, I had three basket of apples with five apples each. If we put all these apples in a huge basket, there would be fifteen apples. The major missing piece in my learning mathematics, then, was that I was never told multiplication was another form of addition \u2013 of similar subjects. I wish my teacher made me understand this then. I always thought multiples were separate functions with indecipherable working algorithms, and divisions were invented by the devil to punish kids who can\u2019t rote-learn what their teachers tell them to!\n\nFew months ago, a primary level mathematics challenge from Singapore had the worldwide social media in its grasp for more than a whole week. Did you find out when Cheryl\u2019s birthday is? By yourself? There may be some history to Asians being good at Mathematics.\n\nAbacus, a tool used to learn Mathematics was invented in China around 500 BC. Abacus is a frame with parallel bars placed inside. There are beads that can move axially on the outer side of the inner bars. A common abacus would have 10 beads in each bar. The lowermost bar is valued at ones place of a decimal number system, then tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on as you move towards the other end.\n\nUse abacus more often for all levels of problems, and pretty soon you will do it faster than many people use calculators. While using the abacus, you also have a better grasp of how decimal number system works, as an abacus is designed exactly how decimal numeric system is designed. After a certain age, children can leave the abacus and do the calculations of same complexity with the same speed as though they are using their abacus. Frequent use becomes muscle memory, and later reflexive. This is how learning anything happens in our brains. We don\u2019t want our children to learn and merely memorize words, we want our children to understand the concepts crystal clear. That will what will make them makers of Nepal\u2019s future!\n\nSo, why is the case for creative learning brought up now? Why after earthquake? Many school are destroyed, and are in the process of rebuilding. Building a school does not only mean building class rooms and assembling desks and benches. Designing learning process and learning toolkits is also a part of school building. Having a chance to rebuild is a chance to build better, fix faults of previous systems. There is purpose, now more than ever. We are gaining momentum, now more than ever! This is not only a chance to make more children pass SLC, but a chance to make the future makers of Nepal learn better.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-20 11:19:32", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 14:23:06.245400", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 645, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2687, 5, 2554], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55405, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10061, "post_number": 17, "raw": "@Jirka_Kocian @natalia_skoczylas @noemi please have a look at this draft text for the events in Czechia for FB and let me know if this works for you:\n\nYou\u2019re not the only one that\u2019s fed up with corrupt politicians and the rich getting richer.

So no problem. One purpose of such conversations is after all to synthesise. :slight_smile:\n\n> I think Cause 2 is a really hard nut to crack as it\u2019s impossible to have open APIs for personal data\n\nI think I understand your concern and fear the Cambridge Analytica 2.0 scenario too, but I would not say it is impossible to solve. We think it is a **very** hard nut to crack though. The way to solve the data sharing problem is not just with technology but also with a lot of education. Such systems need to be very well designed in terms of UX and how to educate people about the way to share data without overwhelming them. That's a whole range of challenges by themselves. \n\n> To spur innovation and bust the tech oligopoly we\u2019ll need open standards, protocols, interoperability etc.\n\nYES! This is exactly what we think too. In order to have more data sovereignty, privacy and better services we think the best metric to optimise for is interoperability, not decentralisation. If we manage to do this, we assume we create the kind of free-market dynamics that could break up the power of those organisations. \n\n> It might take a bit of trust busting from USA and EU to really shake things up through political means.\n\nI think luckily we have the regulatory atmosphere in Europe that is tendentiously more interested in privacy and interoperability, making Europe a very good foundational market for such an effort. \n\n> since most of them don\u2019t seem to realise the importance of working with the whole stack.\n\nCan you elaborate, not sure if I got this. Seems important to understand tho. \n\n> Different communications platforms can be connected to that hub.\n\nThis is one of the thinking processes on how this platform could be architected to avoid a vulnerable centralisation of user data in user's control. Basically finding a way that the data in all the services a user uses is accessible with a Memex, but stays in the \"protection\" of those services, spreading the attack surface. \nHowever to make this possible it would require those oligopolies to play ball to this, which is unlikely. So another route is to use some good ol' [adversarial interoperability](https://boingboing.net/2019/06/07/lightsabers-for-trustbusting.html) to create data formats that interoperate with those services and once such formats have more widespread use it may 'force' previously locked up services to open up more in order to stay competitive. This is a very long game though. \n\n> Storing data locally is incompatible with the nature of social media since the communication is asynchronous.\n\nIndeed it is and a dogmatic approach to decentralisation will not get us very far. We think that there is always a necessity for varying degrees of (de)centralisation in the system, dependent on the use case. \nIn our approach this means that we follow a wordpress.com/org style model where we provide hosting to users who want to have a SaaS experience, but you can self-host your sync/collaboration node too. \nAs decentralised storage technologies like Dat or IPFS mature, it may be purpuseful to use them, but not now. \n\n>  So far blockchains have been unimpressive in their ability of integrating social media or other services into the protocol itself to make data storage disembodied from a singular entity like a corporation.\n\nActually I see a deep dichotomy in the goals that blockchain and cryptocurrencies in particular have that impede their ability to have the impact of decentralisation originally envisioned. \nOn the one hand they use technology that tries to build trustless, distributed systems and on the other hand an economic model that intrinsically creates incentives for centralisation through the speculative nature of how success is shared. \n\n> Does Worldbrain want to compete in an existing market dynamic or do they want to disrupt the dynamics.\n\nWhich dynamics specifically are your referring to?\nThe current market dynamics I understand is the centralisation of user data around corporate entities and the network effects created. If that is what you are talking about, yes our plan is to disrupt that dynamic by giving users unprecedented freedom to move services, a freedom we believe is hard to take away again once given. The big assumption is therefore that over time it may force existing players to adopt such interoperability to stay competitive. \n\nApart from that maybe that answers some of the question:\nThere are 2 different entities forming: \n1) WorldBrain.io as a company which is the developer of (the current) open-source Memex and generates revenue by providing SaaS services to users. \n2) Still to be named: Storex and a community of organisations/individuals as the underlying infrastructure which will be built as a non-profit, multi-partisan entity similar to wordpress.org. WorldBrain.io will likely be the main driver behind its development for the next 1-2 years but keeping it intentionally open and separated from the main business. \n\n>Facebook because it\u2019s too closed and hard to configure and RSS becuase it doesn\u2019t have an algorithm to discern what\u2019s relevant or not.\n\nWe hope through this central store and the upcoming collaboration features that are based on a PubSub model we would combine the best of both worlds. You can have data streams coming in from your various sources and use whatever algorithm, UI or UX you prefer to manage those streams. \nThis modularity is one of the key principles behind building Memex and Storex. \n\n----\nThanks again for your thoughtful comments.

I think the problem with those attempts was that they tried to use governance as a fix to counter the deeply embedded economic incentives of companies. After all if your company is built for growth (which inevitably become exploitative and power-centralising at some point), using governance to solve this is ineffective at best and fails at worst. \n\nThe point of Steward Ownership is to systematically remove the incentives for greed behaviour (infinite potential for growth) by agreeing on a fixed return for investors/contributors before they invest time and/or money. Excess profits can then be used to improve the working conditions, supply chain sustainability, overall service, or simply be given away to charity. \n\n> If it is so, I think it could be made clearer by bolting it on top of Things that need to change, item 2, and explaining that items 1 and 3 are a matter for public policy.\n\nThanks for that suggestion, will see how I can incorporate it. \n\nHowever, I think you can't rely on solely public policy to change 1 and 3. Open-Source software (2) alone won't fix the issue either. I don't even think it is a hard requirement. Interoperability (1) and Steward Ownership structures (2) won't be freely adopted by existing corporations and it is expected, like with the GDPR legislation, that there will be major effort to counter interoperability legislation. And frankly it takes way too long. Time we simply don't have as humanity. So I think a move towards interoperability and Steward Ownership at scale can only work if the primary driver is technological innovation that changes the playing field. This may be supported by legislation at some point, latest when it becomes almost inevitable to strengthen interoperability efforts because of public pressure.", "created_at": "2019-06-26 10:28:55.154654", "updated_at": "2019-06-26 10:28:55.154654", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 714, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 22.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [55711], "is_reply_to": [55711], "is_liked_by": [4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55023, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10120, "post_number": 8, "raw": "[quote=\"natalia_skoczylas, post:7, topic:10120\"]\nI meant ticking boxes as we have them anyway when we sign up on the platform, it doesn\u2019t have to be different I guess?\n[/quote]\n\nNo, for the platform we are convinced that this is enough.", "created_at": "2019-06-12 21:10:53.883414", "updated_at": "2019-06-12 21:10:53.883414", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 43, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [55011], "is_reply_to": [55011], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56055, "user_id": 4892, "topic_id": 10120, "post_number": 18, "raw": "Hi Natalia, sorry, took longer than expected.

What problems do younger people face? How could these two generations meet to help each other? Maybe elderly homes could have a bit of a different character and equipment that could produce something really needed outside of them - for now, they have plenty of workshops inside but what these produce is neither sold not very useful.

Ecological Building Initiatives</h2>\n\nIn alphanumeric order. :bulb: marks projects that we're interested in visiting during the initial field study trip of The Reef 2.0 project.\n\n* **[Begich Towers](http://begichtowers.com/).** A building in Alaska that, in practice, is more or less \"a whole town under one roof\": nearly everyone in that place lives in this 196-apartment building. So [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begich_Towers), this building became known as operating like a small-scale [arcology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcology). In this sense, it is an example of green communal living, even though it came to this fame unintentionally.\n\n* :bulb: **[Calafou](https://calafou.org/en).** Ecoindustrial, post-capitalist commune. The started from a very dilapidated industrial, large space, so could teach a lot about making such a space livable again with limited funding. Not sure how much they are into off-grid living and minimal footprint living, though.\n\n* **[Energiesprong](https://www.energiesprong.org/).** A very interesting concept and company doing energetic building refurbishment on an industrial scale, by manufacturing custom facade and roof parts in factories and just mounting them to the houses. See also [this German article](https://www.dena.de/newsroom/einfach-revolutionaer/) about it, and their various [international chapters](https://www.energiesprong.de/energiesprong-international/).\n\n* **[Fondazione Horcynus Orca](http://www.fdcmessina.org/index.php/pag-sezione/fondazione-horcynus-orca/)** (Messina, Italy). For details, see @alberto's article \"[An innovative social investment model in Messina, Sicily](/t/9451)\".\n\n* :bulb: **[Gemeinschaft Herzfeld Sennr\u00fcti](https://sennrueti.ch/).** An ecovillage style, communal living project in a converted former sanatorium. They started the conversion 2009 and did so in an ecological manner:\n\n    > We used sustainable materials such as wood, straw, cork, wool, clay, sand and cellulose fibers. We also installed thermal and photovoltaic panels, which means we have more than enough to power the entire building with solar energy. Furthermore, rainwater is collected from the roofs and used for flushing toilets, washing machines and in the garden, thus reducing our water usage by 60%. Organic waste is collected and composted or used for making charcoal for the permaculture garden. ([source](https://sennrueti.ch/))\n\n* **[HolzHaus Lynarstra\u00dfe](https://www.neunzehnminuten.de/)** (Berlin, Germany). A low embedded energy building, designed to be sustainable from an environmental point of view through innovative use of wooden/cross laminated timber as a structural material, but also in terms of mixed use, and with half the units set aside for people on financial assistance. Taken from this article about it [Wooden it be Nice](https://www.exberliner.com/features/zeitgeist/save-berlin-wooden-it-be-nice/):\n\n    > The experimental group-housing project has been called Berlin\u2019s biggest WG (house share). Each floor was \u201ccast\u201d with a compatible cluster of residents who live like an extended family. They share a communal living room \u2013 a kitchen, sofa and sometimes a table soccer game all surrounded by exposed wood floors, ceiling and columns\n\n* **[Koptisch-Orthodoxes Kloster Brenkhausen](https://www.koptisches-kloster-brenkhausen.com/)** (H\u00f6xter, near Kassel, Germany). The place that @matthias wrote about in \"[Repairing the Monks' Internet](/t/10198)\". A rather large-scale restoration project of a historic monastery. They have some rather impressive before-and-after photos [here](https://www.koptisches-kloster-brenkhausen.com/fotos-presse/).\n\n* **[Living Energy Farm](https://livingenergyfarm.org/)** (Louisa, Virginia, U.S.A.). A self-sufficient off-grid farm. They developed a very interesting and resource efficient [energy system](https://livingenergyfarm.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tech1.pdf) based on directly driving loads with photovoltaics power during the day, such as mills, pumps, drill press, air compressor. Only lighting and computers can be used during the night, driven by a normal battery buffer.\n\n* **[Mount of Oaks](https://mountofoaks.org/).** An organic farm in rural Portugal, also regularly organizing courses for ecological building techniques. Founded around 2006. Not really for an urban context, though \u2013 it's about cob plastering, wattle and daub etc.. @matthias had been in loose contact with them some years ago.\n\n* :bulb: **[Nea Guinea](http://neaguinea.org/english).** A collective with a demonstration site and learning center at the outskirts of Athens, caring to promote local self-supply for rural and \"rurban\" living. They started in 2009 as a response to the economic crisis in Greece. While they do care about natural building techniques as well, this is focused on rather small-scale interventions:\n\n    > Natural building and bio-climatic architecture \u2026 Construction of compost toilet, Construction of a straw bale warehouse of 20m2, Construction of an earth oven with the use of the cob technique. \u2026 The natural building techniques used will include wood working, earth-bags, rammed earth amongst others. ([source](http://neaguinea.org/2016/08/01/english/))\n\n    However, the core element that can be learned from them is integrating the different parts of self-supply (food supply, energy supply, accommodation etc.) into one space for communal living.\n\n* :bulb: **[\u00d6kodorf Sieben Linden](http://www.siebenlinden.org/).** They have standards for ecological construction and pioneered licenced strawbale buildings in Germany ([says Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96kodorf_Sieben_Linden#Infrastruktur)). [@felix.wolfsteller](/u/felix.wolfsteller) will be able to tell us more!\n\n* :bulb: **[Peace Factory](https://peacefactory.fr/).** A co-housing setup in South-West France based in a converted industrial building that they convert according to ecological principles:\n\n    People buying a loft here do so because they love the idea of converting an industrial building into a co-housing development based on renewable energy sources. We're building BBC style (batiment basse consommation!) which means low on energy and energy bills! ([source](https://www.ic.org/directory/peace-factory-montolieu-france/))\n\n* :bulb: **[ReGen Villages](http://www.regenvillages.com/)** A vision and attempted implementation for self-sufficient, ecologically sustainable, high-tech and high-comfort neighborhoods. This is not about converting existing houses though, but about building new, very different ones.\n\n* **[The Plant](https://plantchicago.org/)** (Chicago, U.S.A.). An aquaponics farm in an old meat packing warehouse. See also [this article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a_n_1497832) about them.\n\n* **[Urban Smart Farm](http://www.urbansmartfarm.be/?fbclid=IwAR2bWHvV3dqVZzIIOUefN5RqYerrvkTuG4gZpHHjKiMuiJpO1N-rrW4517o)** (Ghent, Belgium). Vertical gardening, LED aquaponics and more. 'The Urban Smart Farm uses sea containers to grow herbs, vegetables, fish and shellfish in a sustainable way in the city. In 2016, [Smart Farmers](http://smartfarmers.eu/) built this unique aquaponics farm as a commercial pilot installation. We learned a lot and will start a new project in 2018: in Urban Smart Farm 2.0 all techniques are perfected in a large-scale [Ghent aquaponics cooperative](http://www.urbansmartfarm.be/aquaponics-gent/).'\n\n* :bulb: **[Valldaura Labs](https://valldaura.net/)** (Barcelona, Spain). Very suitable: a large area in the hills just outside Barcelona with a farm, fablab, wood workshop, the [COACT Lab](/t/10774) and other labs etc. to explore ecological, sustainable and autarkic living in practice and to develop new technology for this.\n\n* :bulb: **[Wir Bauen Zukunft](https://wirbauenzukunft.de/)** (Northern Germany). A project for sustainable construction. See [this article on edgeryders.eu](/t/7127) and [this article in National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.de/umwelt/2018/01/ein-zukunftsexperiment-im-westen-mecklenburgs). They focus a lot on tiny houses ([example](https://wirbauenzukunft.de/projekte/passiv-tinyhouse-energiekonzept/)) and other items that are particularly relevant for rural areas, though \u2013 there's nothing about refurbishing a large, multi-story urban building.\n\n* **[YUST (Young Urban Style)](https://www.facebook.com/yust.housing/)** (Antwerp, Belgium). YUST (Young Urban Style) is a reconversion of a former warehouse into a new housing complex with co-housing features and is an answer to the changing demography and housing expectations of new generations. The project comprises a total of 60 rooms and 38 living units for short and long stay and also serves as an event location, restaurant and co-working place. Specific attention was paid to maintenance, total cost of ownership and sustainability. Maximum focus on BIM, started from a 3D scan, proves to be the ideal tool to coordinate all technical stakeholders. The 3D model is also the basis of the materials passport for the building. These specific points of attention make it possible to (re) use the building as a BAMB (Building As Material Bank) in the future.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. People and Organizations to Contact</h2>\n\nPeople connected to sustainable living and urban development, esp. in Belgium. We may want to get in touch with them for the upcoming project. This is a wide net, including everyone from city authorities to green consultants, digital storytellers and community builders. \n\nIn alphanumeric order.\n\n* :bulb: **[AndreaSuDS](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-urban-living-is-green-looking-for-skilled-partnership-builder-for-the-reef-in-brussels/10449/10)** (Brussels). \"I am a PhD researcher on SuStainable Drainage Systems recently moved from UK to Brussels (and staying).

In <i>Solar Revolution,</i> German biophysicist Dieter Broers makes a compelling case, pointing to a wealth of scientific evidence that shows a remarkable correlation between increases in solar activity and advances in our creative, mental, and spiritual abilities.\n\nWe are in the midst of a dramatic rise in solar disturbances, which have the ability to affect Earth in alarming ways, disrupting the geomagnetic field, knocking out entire power grids, and influencing the development of organisms and the ecology as a whole. Remarkably, solar activity is predicted to peak toward the end of 2012.\n\nBut Broers--who has for decades been studying the effect of electromagnetic fields on biological systems -- sees the coming shift not as an apocalypse, but as the dawn of a new age. Drawing on research from a variety of scientific disciplines, Broers shows how this eruption of solar activity is a positive thing for humanity, that it is boosting our brain capacity and expanding our minds in ways we never imagined possible. Abilities now seen as extraordinary or supernatural--such as telepathy, extrasensory perception, and off-the-charts intelligence quotients--will become ordinary and natural ... and may very well help us solve the mounting global crises we're now facing.\n\nWithout a doubt, the way we think, feel, relate, communicate, and experience reality has been changing dramatically in recent years, and Broers affirms those changes will ultimately culminate in a new form of consciousness and harmony on Earth. Humankind is going through an evolutionary leap, says Broers, and the process has already begun.\n\n<h2>\u00a0</h2>", "created_at": "2012-03-10 15:02:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.568245", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 960, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4381, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 4348, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Now that the dust of the earthquake in Nepal is settling, Edgeryders' <a href=\"/t/future-makers-nepal/598\">Future Makers Nepal</a> project emerged as a project to survey, contact and connect the citizen-driven relief efforts and help projects which are springing up in large numbers after the earthquake in Nepal. After that, the project will serve as a platform for Nepal's \"future makers\" to discuss and align in search for constructive, peaceful solutions to salient problems of Nepal. We are happy that UNDP Nepal commissioned us for this project and now adapted it so that we contribute meaningfully to fixing what the earthquake destroyed.\n\nBut we here in Kathmandu (<a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a> and <a href=\"/u/natalia_skoczylas\">@Natalia_Skoczylas</a>) could never do that alone: We are looking to hire two persons who would like to join our team on a part-time contract for the next two and a half months. Together we can then effectively reach local initiatives dispersed all across the country, and make this project feasible and adequate.\n\nThe activities that we need these local engagement managers to do are like this:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Preparing posts in both English and Nepali about mapped initiatives. (Means, you should be able to write well in both languages.)</li>\n\n<li>Finding Nepal's local earthquake-response and reconstruction initiatives and documenting them in a structured way here on edgeryders.eu, with information about their activities, people involved, scale of the project, etc..</li>\n\n<li>Welcoming the people from Nepal's earthquake-response initiatives that show up on the edgeryders.eu platform, and facilitating an online dialogue between them that connects them and yields further information about the initiatives.</li>\n\n<li>Preparing social media campaigns and outreach activities in order to expand the database of initiatives and the edgeryders.eu visitors from Nepal. In the later phase of the project, this will be about a whole range of grassroot initiatives, not only those related to relief efforts, but everyone who is involved in citizen-driven positive change in Nepal.</li>\n\n<li>Where possible, connecting the mapped initiatives and people with each other for their mutual benefit. For example, proposing somebody with relevant skills for an open position in a project, and connecting projects that complement each other.</li>\n\n<li>Helping your sometimes lost-in-the-context Edgeryders from Europe to understand things beyond their clumsy assumptions and explanations ;)</li>\n\n<li>Being prepared for The Unexpected (that turned out very useful the last week \u2026).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe pay we offer for these half-time jobs is 40,000 NRS per month (approx. 400 U.S. Dollars).\n\nIf you would like to be one of our local engagement managers, please post a comment below with something relevant about you and your experience for this job. We will then be in dialogue here for a bit, and finally tell with whom we want to work. Ideally we would like to start working with you from the 10th of May on.\n\nP.S.: There are many of you who'll be great for the job, but we can only hire two. So please don't waste your time on a \"competitive application\" \u2013 there are more meaningful things than that in Nepal at the moment ;) If not in this job, you will surely have more ways to contribute to relief and reconstruction after the earthquake in Nepal. We invite you to connect with other initiatives here on edgeryders.eu and beyond.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-02 06:56:21", "updated_at": "2017-08-29 08:07:08.373738", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 602, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 76.4, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 3, 8, 149, 1856, 2598], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24977, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 2334, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Spreading the unWord and legalites</b>\n\n<span>Posting quickly because [Alberto]'s post sparked a few thoughts, that I might otherwise forget.\u00a0</span><br style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;\">\n\nFirstly:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<span>\"As for scaling, that means essentially telling the tale \u2013 having Ben and others wander Europe spreading the unword, looking for possible partners in starting other unMonasteries, building up a reservoir of candidate unMonasterians etc.\"</span>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<span>I recently applied personally to a funding scheme aimed at supporting individual research - part of my application was focused specifically on this idea of travel relating to unMonastery and so I included in my budget a 1 month global interrail pass and lightweight easy to use AV\u00a0equipment. Good news is that I got the grant! Obviously funds aren't necessarily needed for this kind of work, since it's easy to rideshare and hitchhike but I think it's a very legitimate element to a budget and fits well with the idea of the unMonastery and pilgrimages.\u00a0\n\nSecond thought, \"</span>increasing the unMonastery self-sufficiency\" - for me, the principle goal of the unMonastery is to show how it can work in real terms, although economic terms are relevant to this, for me the basic argument throughout Europe is about the <em>existing</em> (but erroding)\u00a0public ownership of land and buildings that can be put to better use. The economics should be argued based on the evaluation of social/community assets that the project is able to increase or create. This is though an alien concept to many and as a result we trade space almost exclusively for money given. Creating resilient food and energy sources is obviously key to this but equally so are the legal documents need to do it quickly...\n\nIncreasing the self-sufficiency for me is as much about removing the friction between groups that want to realise a project such as the unMonastery and the boxes that need to be ticked by the local institutions/governmental bodies. In Europe there already exists a very prevalent form of private enterprise which the unMonastery seeks to out manevour in social terms - these enterprises are known as 'guardianship' companies, such as <a href=\"http://uk.cameloteurope.com/\">Camelot</a>. The most effective man-in-the-middle attack I have ever seen in property relations. Guadianship companies use a special kind of contract that allows them to employ individuals to look after publically owned buildings they have been hired to managed.

But we would add an API endpoint that does a signup and creates and returns a new API key at the same time.\n\n\n### Spambot management\n\nThe challenge will however be that this software allows users to sign up and then post to Discourse without even an e-mail address confirmation, or the trust level based restrictions by Discourse. So we'll need to replace these mechanisms with mechanisms of our own, and will have to be a bit creative about this. Such as:\n\n* Configuring the instance used by Natalia with a static signup key, for example by adding it as a GET parameter to the bookmark URL used on the workstation where the software will run on Biennale.\n\n* In other cases, handing out links with one-time signup keys via e-mail campaigns.\n\n* In case of using such links in Twitter campaigns or other very public places, giving the signup links a limited lifetime of 1-3 days and hoping that spambots won't find them before.\n\nAnyway, the way how Discourse avoids 98% of all spam signups is that spambots are too dumb to use a JavaScript SPA. They can only use HTML forms.

I didn't know that you had extended the Discourse API and packaged that into a gem. That's quite elegant indeed. But how would you solve the issue that we don't want the static front end site to hold any API keys? How I do things now is that I let the Participio cache API have the Discourse API key. Having a cache avoids the issue that in some cases the rate-limiting from the open API might make loading a minisite very slow if it, for example, loading posts from 3 categories, 2 tags and also getting the full content of 6 posts all at the same time. If the user clicks reload a few times, they can end up not getting any content at all before the rate limit is dropped again for their IP. And having an API key means that we can load content from protected \"web content\" categories.

The uninitiated user would assume that the description is anchored to the selected text, just as the chosen code. While in reality, the description is anchored to the code.\n\n### A different proposal for making descriptions more accessible\n\nSo instead, how about hyperlinking the code bubble in existing annotations in the Annotator overlay to the corresponding record from the [list of codes](https://edgeryders.eu/administration/annotator/codes)? Clicking it would bring the ethnographer to the place to add or edit the description. To illustrate, the thing under the mouse pointer here would have the hyperlink:\n\n![Image1|424x105](upload://bbvjgSEq392iQ9Oi5Q3RK17JIlq.png) \n\nIn addition, it will probably be useful to read the description of a code before applying it \u2013 in case of being unsure what it was about again. For that, we could show a small popover with the description when mousing over a proposal in the list of code suggestions. Means, the popover with the existing code description would appear in a case like this:\n\n![Image2|358x257](upload://o3dcfFrnlyFpF8mtQKqBUCOPOni.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf that's a suitable proposal, let me know and I'd put it on the list of development tasks for Open Ethnographer.", "created_at": "2019-06-29 12:34:37.454461", "updated_at": "2019-06-29 12:37:26.019508", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 423, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 11.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [55853], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 55863, "user_id": 4986, "topic_id": 10251, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Interesting pattern of signups and contributors.

And rather than having to use expensive-to-buy, and expensive-to-run, machinery, you can control it with a computer that costs a few euro's to manufacture from parts, and runs on AA batteries. :D\n\nAdd in the use of self-built power generation systems, and self-built power-storage systems, and the running costs drop to almost zero.\n\nGet enough land, and a clean water supply, so that you can build a sufficient number of these, <a href=\"http://wickcuriosityshop.net/collection/plant-regulated-growing-system\">http://wickcuriosityshop.net/collection/plant-regulated-growing-system\u00a0\u00a0 </a>and you've got most of your food supply sorted.

I don't need to sell the secret sauce to most hackers. Enough of them already believe in it. (Look at how the Amiga computer was developed, look at Xerox parc, look at open source, etc).\n\n\u00a0\n\nBackup plans B C D .. Z are good. I hope we will anticipate all scenarios and have a plan for everything. (Or a 'play be ear' plan plan).\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe minimum goal will be to get cool people living together, and give them the freedom to work on fixing the world. If that doesn't happen, or falls apart, then the project will have been a catastrophic failure. (This applies to unMon too, right?). The next question that comes to my mind is: 'How much further can we go?'. At the end of the scale we have.. (..next Google.. ending suffering.. utopia..). So yeah, I try to push things as far as they will go.\n\n\"In those terms, telling people anything not resulting in building the next Google is a failure is a really bad idea: it sets the bar impossibly high for most people\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nAhhh. I didn't mean/say '_anything_ that doesn't become the next Google is a failure'. What I wanted to express was that in my personal thoughts, if the project I'm involved in doesn't become the next Google, then I'll be disappointed. Because I believe that we have the potential to do that. (Even if I were 'setting the bar impossibly high' for 'most people', I guess it might be a good thing, and I guess it doesn't do any harm cos: (1) The bar IS high. Right? Everybody wants to fix all the problems in the world, and the world is massive. (2) How many ERs are going to think 'This is too hard, I won't even try to jump?' or 'I'll never be able to jump as high as that, so I won't bother jumping at all'? None, I should hope!).\n\n\u00a0\n\n(I also have a feeling that generally people aren't as ambitious as they should be. There is sometimes a mind set that says we can't 'compete' with big business and governments, but we can. If mind set causes anyone not to fulfil their potential - that's bad. We can avoid it by setting the bar impossibly high. The sky is the limit. Of course (as I think you're trying to point out), the danger here is that people might get disheartened even if they do something awesome but realise that the bar is still much higher. I think we solve this by saying to them: 'Wow, you did something amazing! Now see if you can go higher!?'. And also point out that if one is trying to jump over a bar that might result in injury or the risk of total failure is very high, then it's better to do something that you're more confident is achievable.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI should also say that 'being the next Google' is not the only thing bwcd.vdcn.org is about. Others in the group will say 'that's not important to me' and stress other aspects of the project. If you like the BWCD Intentional farming community stuff, but you're not into the 'be the next Google' thing, my friend Spencer is the guy to talk to. (He is a good balance for me :-)\n\n\"Community is the only ace up our sleeve\"\n\nI'd expand this by saying our big advantage is that we care deeply about what we're doing. Any system fuelled by greed or self interest can't generate the same degree of passion as people fuelled by love. (I have a theory that the smarter you get the more likely you are to be altruistic. So the good guys will always win, cos they're smarter (by smarter I'm talking more about 'enlightened' rather than 'raw intelligence/brain power'). But..! We probably shouldn't bother going into that kind of philosophy here!)\n\n\"So I came out of the woodworks to vouch for fire hydrant building to be a worthy goal in and of itself, in case someone out there was getting anxiety.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nCool. I think unMon is awesome. It's an amazing achievement just to get as far as you have done so far, and I hope (and expect it will) go on to accomplish all the things you hope for. I didn't mean for anyone to think that I was devaluing the role of unMon. I can't stress enough how much I love (and value) that stuff like this is going on, and how much in awe I am of everyone involved.\n\nGodspeed muMon!

I want to register now for the Book of Mistakes a fundamental flaw in the unMonastery prototype - so that it is not repeated in future iterations. <strong>One project per a person is a bad idea.</strong>\n\nThe unMonastery was in many ways intended to be a place where a group worked together collectively to solve problems and in doing so build a new way of working - which drew from the tradition of past monastic orders. Framing the call of applicants around the idea of individual experts, with individual work, is a total anathema to healthy and productive collaboration. As a result we suffer from a deeply rooted concern with individual objectives, a logistical strain and a sense that any time spent working together is damaging and restricts ones own project.\n\nIt would be good to discuss alternatives for future iterations on this thread but it\u2019s important to say this wasn\u2019t the sole concern of our meeting. Instead the specific concern here is to extend the project and to prove value in our work by the end of May - for 2 reasons, firstly if those here don\u2019t now act to ensure others can enjoy the same experience of the unMonastery, it might be considered as little more than holiday for hackers. And secondly, more fundamentally, any kind of failure in Matera will cast a long lasting shadow on the potential for others projects like the unMonastery to succeed here.\n\nSo with this said, here\u2019s the overview produced prior to the meeting and an initial set of outcomes.\n\n<strong>OVERVIEW AND AGENDA</strong>\n\n<strong>Initial Draft of Stakeholder Interests:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<strong>MT2019</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tDesire to act at policy making level</li>\n\n<li>\t\tDesire to establish a neutral space</li>\n\n<li>\t\tImproving Communication with the city</li>\n\n<li>\t\tCreating an international dimension to the bid</li>\n\n<li>\t\tCreating a social innovation dimension to the bid</li>\n\n<li>\t\tThe future of the building itself</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAddressing the Challenges</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<strong>EdgeRyders</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tGood communication and involvement of people remotely</li>\n\n<li>\t\tCreate a successful pilot project for \u2018Proof of Concept\u2019 \u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\t\tGenerate discussion and content for the platform</li>\n\n<li>\t\tBring more people to EdgeRyders</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<strong>City of Matera</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tImprove the city</li>\n\n<li>\t\tCreate a space for children and intergenerational dialogue/activity</li>\n\n<li>\t\tUpskilling</li>\n\n<li>\t\tConnecting citizens to a global dialogue</li>\n\n<li>\t\tEstablished a shared space</li>\n\n<li>\t\tPlatform for discussing burning issues</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Issues</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\t\tLack of Capacity - Collaborator Roles - \u2018Experts\u2019 from Outside</li>\n\n<li>\t\tTime - Less than 2 months</li>\n\n<li>\t\tProving Value</li>\n\n<li>\t\tPlanning that goes into extension</li>\n\n<li>\t\tCommunication (is a mess)</li>\n\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t<strong>Extending unMonastery Objectives (Rough Sketch)</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\t\tEnsure Additional Funds\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\t\t\t<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvBTERaT9bWOdGRwWHAwc0piOGVqakhMTVQyOEFXX2c#gid=0\">Establish Budget / Figure out how much we have saved</a>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\t\tBuild relationship with Joseph Grima</li>\n\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\tSecure 6 funded unMonasterians (3 Local / 3 International)</li>\n\n<li>\t\tCreate 3 Partnerships with Matera based Organisations - that ensures active use and co-ownership of the space. \u00a0\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>\t\tSolve 11 Challenges</li>\n\n<li>\t\tFull transition at the end of the year to citizenry of Matera</li>\n\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n<li>\t\u200b<strong>Objectives Now - How do we get there?

The Brussels contingent is especially lucky, because we are in the middle of everything, with good rail and bus connections. \n\nHere's my idea:\n\n* We build a good wiki with resources for overland traveling. I have been particularly vexed with the bad experience of buying multicountry train tickets online vis-a-vis doing the same thing with flights. @matthias can probably help here. If that turns out to be unsolvable, we make a contract with a good travel agency in Brussels (or Tallinn). \n* We dream up an \"office everywhere\" kit, that makes it comfortable to work while on trains and buses. On long trips, for example, I take with me [The Roost](https://www.therooststand.com/) and an external keyboard. The kit could also include things like travel pillows and noise-cancelling headphones (@nadia's favourite). The idea is: you can use long train/bus rides to work, or play, or whatever, they are not \"dead zones\". We could even consider subsidizing some of those items for Edgeryders folks. In some cases they can be shared: at the BXL office we have several travel power adapters, for example. \n* We make a company policy of \"make it matter\", by encouraging trips of at least three nights out. This will (a) encourage us to travel less and (b) build more solid relationship with clients, partners and the people we travel to see, thereby helping us substitute conference calls for meetings in the long run.\n* And of course we do not insist on people taking 40 EUR Ryanair flights. \n\nWhat do you think?", "created_at": "2019-08-15 11:21:05.864632", "updated_at": "2019-08-15 11:21:05.864632", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 295, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 37.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 5201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57598, "user_id": 5201, "topic_id": 10425, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Yes, that's absolutely true.

I enjoyed the statistics and quotes.\n\nI noticed that you put, in this order:\n\n1) change the mentality (of government officials);\n\n2) change the way the government does things.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but there are rarely resources planned for the \"education\" or training of government employees and members of parliament, as part of government initiatives related to open government and open data. Perhaps it would not be a bad thing to create an 'open government training'.\n\nThere exists ethics classes, here in Quebec, for municipal elected officials. These are mandatory, according to the <a href=\"http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=/E_15_1_0_1/E15_1_0_1.html\">Loi sur l'\u00e9thique et la d\u00e9ontologie en mati\u00e8re municipale</a>. 8100 Quebec municipal officials, including mayors, will be \"trained\" in ethics this year. The provincial government created this special training because municipalities struggle against allegations of corruption since the outbreak of scandals in the area of construction and the granting of contracts. (<a href=\"http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/politique/201103/30/01-4384913-cours-dethique-pour-elus-municipaux.php\">ref</a>)\n\nEuh... it's more or less the same thing - same problems - at the provincial level...\n\nDon't ask me why such classes are just for municipal government, and not for the provincial and federal level. It seems to me that there would be a great need out there as well. I would really like to attend these classes, out of curiosity, to see what they teach there, what they talk about, find out about the examples they provide. But beyond content, I would pay attention, I would especially watch the reactions of the members of government.\n\nWhy not have something like the mandatory training for ethics, but instead of ethics, for open government? And why not also have open government training to inform citizens of how they can use open data portals and various platforms and other services?\n\nMany speak about the need of a change of mentality. Here in Quebec, the Gautrin group mentioned it in July 2011. Am I the only one? I must admit that I get extremely confused when I hear this. <span><span>My brain</span> starts <span>to run </span><span>at lightning speed</span><span>,</span> <span>without achieving</span> <span>any reasonable results</span><span>. </span></span>I try to imagine it in my head. I make an endless list of scenarios, but it is impossible to get a clear picture in my mind. What do they mean??? How will they go about doing that???\n\nIt is not enough, in my opinion, to create open data and open government experimental projects - in a little corner of a government - without involving the entire machine, all employees of the government, and all citizens, in a serious learning process. <span><span>They need</span> <span>major coaching!</span></span>\n\nBecause governments make laws on mandatory ethics training...

As both me and @anon82932460 have mentioned several times, in calls, on riot, and [here on the platform](https://edgeryders.eu/t/about-paid-ads-and-re-working-of-strategies-for-promotion-of-edgeryders/10420): you can't expect miracles from only social media, in any outreach strategy you use different strategies including in-person.

But I do know both go hand-in-hand, and with ads you can broaden reach, and in-turn, increase conversions.

Lesya is second from left.</em>\n\n## :gb: **_English version_** <a name=\"en\"></a>\n\nThe first change maker in Belarus that I want to write about is Lesya Pchelka. I know Lesya already for more than 1 year and she has inspired many people around her including me with her ideas, strength and willpower to create awareness about the waste economy in Belarus. It all started when Lesya saw many people around her who just threw away the most amazing things, things, which would be so useful to other people. She got inspired by the many charity shops that she came across while visiting Russia and Paris. She wanted to bring this concept to Belarus. And this is exactly what she did.\n\nShe realized her dream about a year ago when she combined a collection point where people can bring their old/unused clothing with a shop.  90 percent of the clothing is donated to charity while 10 percent is being sold in the shop.  That\u2019s the concept of the charity shop \u2018Kalilaska\u2019.\n\nTo realize her dream Lesya quit her photographer job and sold her professional camera to use the money as the starting capital. Lesya then gathered likeminded people to help her in this adventure and soon they found an old factory where an exhibition space was located. Together with her team she decided that this would become the place where the first Belarusian charity shop will be.  She named the shop \u2018Kalilaska\u2019, which means \u2018you\u2019re welcome\u2019 and \u2018thank you\u2019 at the same in the Belarusian language.  \n\nKalilaska\u2019s activities do not stop with collecting, giving and selling old or unused clothing. They raise awareness for their concept in other creative and fun ways - for example by organising concerts for which they invite alternative artists who perform for free. As entrance fee they don\u2019t ask money, but rather ask visitors to bring an item. They have given themed concerts, one of them with the theme cats and dogs. As entree fee the audience had to bring cat and dog food. Next day they went to the animal asylum and donated the collected food. Last Christmas, the theme of the concert was Christmas party for kids. So the entrance fee was Christmas presents, which a day later they have given to kids from an orphanage.\n\nEvery time Lesya and her team bring the collected \u2018entrance fee\u2019 to an orphanage or a boarding house they bring along entertainment and fun for the kids. They play and laugh with the children and of course bring them presents. Lesya explained how awfully harsh the conditions are in some boarding houses, where some people don\u2019t even have shampoo to wash their hair with so the caretakers have to shave the hair for hygiene purposes.  \n\nWhat Kalilaska tries to change in Belarus is to make \u2018giving\u2019 a standard instead of an exception. To achieve this Lesya believes in open and better communication about waste and donation points. When people know where they can bring their old clothing that will be given a second life and help others that are less fortunate, people will be more willing to actually embed this in their daily practice. What I find fascinating about Kalilaska\u2019s approach is that they introduce a totally new concept, which in the beginning was often misunderstood by many in Belarus. Lesya frequently spoke about the accusing way many people reacted to this rather \u2018strange\u2019 concept of promoting yourself as charity and at the same time having a shop and thus make an \u2018earning\u2019 out of it. People find it the concept of a social business difficult to understand. So Lesya replied to this accusation by simply being transparent about the expenses of Kalilaska. A great strategy that fits very well with Kalilaska\u2019s message!\n\nCouple of months ago Kalilaska had to move out of the first location because of high costs. But the good news is that they have found a new and even better located place for their Charity shop. They are now renovating the place and hopefully will open their doors soon!\n\nVisit Kalilaska on their [Website:]( www.kalilaska.org) or on their [Facebook

that lead to increased justice\n[/quote]\n\nOk a rough proposal for us to kick around:\n\n1. Basic idea: Get people to share what they are interested in through story, comment others - we use this as data on which we do ethno + social semantic analysis to identify topics or around which there are clusters projects/people building things. Then we organise the session on location with facilitars to get from discussion to shaping a concept note for something people want to do/build/research together that unlocks something for their work.\n\n\n2. Follow up: We publish concept notes and the discussions around them on platform. We then do a public collaborative comms campaign where we ask people to suggest calls for funding proposals that match with the concept notes.\n\n3. Next step: is follow up proposal development sprint for each concept cluser + the calls/opportunities for financing that are relevant for it. How: A number of concept notes + matching calls for submissions are selected for an event session where everyone leaves with a skeleton proposal fleshed out. \n\n4. Follow up on platform where we have feedback from people from the community who have experience in evaluating proposals e.g Martin , Alberto, Marco Manca, Katja, and others if they are up for it.. They give partcipants feedback, ask questions etc.\n\nWhat do you guys think? @BlackForestBoi  @hugi ?", "created_at": "2019-08-29 09:48:37.932114", "updated_at": "2019-08-29 09:48:37.932114", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 233, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 38.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [57388], "is_reply_to": [57388, 58444], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58223, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10454, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Last touches:\n\ninstead of Cz\u0142onkowie let's use U\u017cytkownik\u00f3w (it's the polish grammar) \n\nInstead of wirutalnej Kawiarni : Spotkajmy si\u0119 w wirtualnej kawiarni (let's meet in virtual cafe)\n\nHistorie dla Ciebie (not ciebie, small letter) = and maybe let's take away the dot at the end?

What follows are my notes from the final round of discussions in an intense day. Each quote is the transcription of what one individual said. I will be writing a separate post, or possibly even series of posts as the conversations were very rich and offered a lot of things to think about and explore around care.\n\n<em>\u201cIt was a good experience, I liked meeting people from different backgrounds and the possibility for working together\u2026 Discovering what we each are good and not good at, and how they can fit together. \u00a0As well as what these different backgrounds creates as a perspective towards the project\u201d</em>\n\n\u201cFor me exploring new projects and ways of working is not new, so changing my setup is not new. Converting ideas to communities. Setting up a framework that people can work within. But for product designers is not the case. I could understand Nadia\u2019s language well..It could be good to translate the language and vocabulary used by the OpenCare project into language easier to use for product designers. Designers are mostly visual, other disciplines less so. Some bridging of languages could be helpful.\u201d\n\n<em>\u201cWe were discussing the questions on the wall- what care means on fundamental level to us. Under which conditions care is being granted in a community and what that means for us. When discussing integration of people into a group, the separation you make in the beginning affects the integration project...You say there is an external person who should adapt to the community itself, instead of thinking about creating something new from scratch out of the welcoming community and new individials. Especially when you talk about care...you always do the labelling that there is someone who needs help, and I am one to provide help. Maybe getting rid of these labels is important. Also we talked about how social relations to certain people are necessary for providing some kinds of care. And how to solve challenges of providing care for people we don\u2019t already know. You touch people physically (as we did in the opening session today) and it changes relationship immediately e.g. free hugs in public spaces: This changes something very fast. Especially in regards to refugee topic\u2026.Before helping there should be a contact, a communication with people before offering help whether you know they need or not.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201c We started different no thinking about projects, but our own experiences being people on the move.\u00a0</em>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>Being somewhere where you chose to go</em></li>\n\n<li><em>Being somewhere you didn't\u2019 pick: job, being refugee, \u00a0being moved by parents...how it affects your mindset</em></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<em>What is the difference between these two in terms of care on the move?\n\nOne person was talking about being in china for job of her father to experience completely difft culture and not being free to decide to go there\u2026.vs choosing to move to a new city voluntarily in a city where many different cultures in Kreuzberg. Just getting to know different food and culture at a very young age and getting to know this in a playful way without much prejudice in your head\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cWe started off by talking about situations in our lives where we have given care, or seen other people receiving care. Who are those people who have taken on traditional care of caregiving? We quickly started talking about feminist issues and women being caregivers through history. We also talked about the rewards, how giving care is valued, if valued at all or you get financial remuneration\u2026\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cWe were all answering the question of why we chose the different topics and why we chose them. Mine was about being on the move and the point that is for me very importan is the idea of doing something fo the first time and you have to cope, no matter if you have to do a job or ...you are always doing for the first time. Found a sory in newspaper about caregivers and they tried to set up school for nurses where they given puppets they have to be with for weeks before working with humans. Switch perspective. I found a flyer which was something like a manual for shopping in supermarket in the fifties..they were handing flyers out about how to behave and shop in he supermarket and now people are complaining about refugees not knowing \u00a0how to behave the first time...there is an arrogance... What is possible with products etc to switch perspective and lose embarrassment etc around doing something for the first time. People \u201cmisbehave\u201d because. The first time I met a Syrian guy was during the refugee crisis, it was first time experience for both of us, no just him.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cWe were mostly talking about first time experience of meeting some guys from syria. How can we start meeting people on a high level and not relationship that we are giving, and they are receiving donations. That we are both receiving and giving care.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cWe started talking about experiences and what think about care, or what we need for our self to be cared for or give care. I found that we had really different ways of talking or explaining. I had difficulties to say what I was thinking and they only understood me when I made examples. And they totally understood me. But when Nema started talking, she could really articulate herself without giving examples. It\u2019s really interesting as a product designer.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cWe talked about personal experiences. Because of this we came to many topics- like how it is to be a European or come from another continent. It was nice because we had an open chat with one another, so we had some long discussions. It was nice to hear about other people\u2019s stories because sometimes you don\u2019t talk about it for long, but when you do it for one hour and you have some perspectives on how to give care for refugees but also what it\u2019s like to be a foreigner in Germany.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cUnter sich haben sie die kulturellen Unterschiede nicht wirklich gemerkt, wenn man gemeinsam mit vielen Kulturen aufwaechst. Der einzige Unterschied, der immer da bleibt, und erfahrbar ist, ist der kulinarische Unterschied. Vielleicht ist die Perspektive eines Kindes die beste: Unvoreingenommen Dinge aufnehmen, ohne sie direkt zu beurteilen. Gerade als Kind ist es eine grosse Bereicherung, auf so viele unterschiedliche Kulturen zu treffen. Fuer die Erziehung und die Ausbildung der eigenen Persoenlichkeit ist es absolut foerderlich, in Konfrontation mit vielen Kulturen aufzuwachsen.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cWe had a discussion about \u201cstranger danger\u201d. Which I have recently been having with people from older generations. When it comes to refugee crisis , even people I know that normally would act very human and never put themselves above another suddenly are afraid when refugees come to the country. In part it is because of the lack of contact; they don\u2019t come naturally to a place where exchange could happen in an uncontrived way. How could this be set up, or how could it happen? We talked about how younger people can be a connector, how it needs a connector...there are many of us who want to engage but don't because the connection is needed and doesn\u2019t happen without being designed. When travelling connecting is very easy, but in your own town you rarely have deep conversations with people you don\u2019t know. Openness as a mindset is very interesting to see how society is structured n our head. How this huge fear that comes out of nowhere. Media says you should have fear now, that the new is threatening. I love my Grandma but when it comes to this topic I think omg we should not even talk about this topic and I have no idea how to change things. I think it\u2019s a lot of empathy, we had a huge fight...it was all about him not letting what\u2019s happen...not wanting to feel it...keeping it theoretical. The next day there was a change of perspective. It\u2019s also overwhelming for many people, related to make yourself vulnerable and allowing yourself to feel. It\u2019s a very delicate and sensitive how to do this contact and get them in touch with their feelings.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cWe were talking about different languages. To map out what we can as GWK and product designers (UDK) and to figure out what is the responsibility towards what we are studying. Until now what designers were doing and what we were studying was just about making things beautiful. Are we even responsible towards building towards big visions the way \u00a0OpenCare is doing? As designers we are always looked upon in a very belittling way - as though we are not capable of contributing to the big issues. But I believe it is part of our responsibility as designers to do this work, because ideally we are focusing not on profiting from it but we can do it just to help. Everyone knows we should help, but no one really does it and people still have prejudices and discriminate. Not many of us know how it is to lead a refugee\u2019s life. How many of us have been discriminated against? For me I was born in Germany, but for a moment I thought well all the refugee circus that is going on has nothing to do with me and I thought it is the responsibility of larger organisations like NGos and the Government to deal with...I asked myself what capacity do I realistically have to help. Then I realised that as someone born in Germany, I walk around the street I hear people discriminating against Asians. And I realised it does affect me, and it is my responsibility to help...It is about the right to be a creative and work not just for profit, but \u00a0to help others and how this is deeply human at its core.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cI think it is always important to find new symbiotic relationships between people. One Project I\u2019ve come across is one in which there were two groups: one group who wanted to learn English but didnt have connections to do so, and the other group was old lonely group from America. These two groups were able to talk to each other via skype. The Old people had the joy of talking to somebody who was interested in learning. And the young people learned English. It\u2019s very nice to see people caring about each other that way.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cFor me it was very interesting to hear what makes something seem foreign and why we feel home. What makes this happen?\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cWe were still thinking about what is th goal of being a designer and what is a design process...what is the difference to art or to management/managers job? We came to the point that an artist is focusing on showing problem and designer is trying to find solution and manager is more focused on company\u2019s project and not so much on helping people. It\u2019s a beginning of a discussion.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cWe were not talking about the differences between student areas. It was interesting seeing how there was a lot of variation in how interviews were conducted in the different groups as well as within the group were different. I think what I found was that we had very different styles of leading interviews and how different results. I realised I am used to lead an interview and how it has become my only way for me. And it was really interesting to see there are different kinds of ways to lead an interview. I learned how to lead interviews in design thinking...you are asking for stories and ask 5 times why. It\u2019s completely differnt thing when trying to understand a person. It was a very good experience. And apart from that my main insight is that care is always interactional, its not a one way street. The system of capitalism is making it a one way street because there s wlays money in and something out. It\u2019s not evolutionary.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cWe talked about the relationships that we have with people from Syria that we know and the experiences we have with them. We try to know why German people are so scared of foreigners and why the German people are sometimes so closed also in a friendship. For example my first time was not so easy to make friends here, german people are really closed the first time..they are not so open to stangers.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cIt was really intersting hearing about your experiences and the difficulties you had. Very interesting to talk from a personal perspectives and the fears you have.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cWe discussed the five questions we were given. What I noticed te most that care is a very difficult term. We couldn;t find a term for care in german. This is one part that makes the discussion very interesting but also very difficult. A whole lot of people are going in a direction towards the refugee topic, that seems to be very close to people. I heard about a book from two journalists about political language: some words and terms that are used are producing certain realities. When you use some words regularly especially in the media, it becomes a reality and then there is no alternative. Translating care into a german word, and speaking about it means very different thing.\u201d\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>\u201cWe also tried to approach the topic from a more general angle, what care really means for us. We came to conclusion that care, giving and receiving, is a basic human need and a human right. It\u2019s not a one-way street, but we need to talk about care as a devalued thing in our society. There are people who really love to give are and do not have the right to get something for it. We thought about how to make people who give care more visible. How can we provide some kind of reward or value for the volunteers. And of course we went in the feminist direction but I think it is a really important thing to value care as a huge thing in society.\u201d</em>\n\n<em>\u201cCare which we translated into Pfleger. Has not only to do with caring about other people and also for yourself. Is it important to care for yourself first or the other way around? It\u2019s a challenge to care for huge number of people at once. Monetization and how it affects our view on people around us: that we cannot be more intuitive because we think about how we can be most effective.This question where german politicians are saying we have to take care of our people, and not just give everything away. Same thing at a different scale. We have to look at how we distributed in different ways. I would like to see politicians say how they care for themselves, I would like to see them living a lifestyle which shows people how to live a healthy life.\u201d</em>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-04 21:08:33", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 16:41:11.741308", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2648, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28863, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3883, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Thanks</b>\n\n&lt;3\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-11 10:16:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:38.861064", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28814], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58097, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 10549, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Note to @hugi", "created_at": "2019-08-19 09:12:44.670753", "updated_at": "2019-08-19 09:12:44.670753", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 23.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58046], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11932, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1441, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Le germe d'une nouvelle lumi\u00e8re</b>\n\nAllo Serge,\n\nMerci pour la tr\u00e8s belle description de ton fils! J'ai h\u00e9sit\u00e9 pr\u00e8s d'un mois et demi avant de publier ce rapport de mission \u00e0 propos de Giacomo, car c'\u00e9tait le plus original de ma s\u00e9rie de quatre. Je suis contente d'apprendre qu'il existe d'autres jeunes, qui ont des ressemblances avec le Giacomo que j'ai d\u00e9crit.\n\nMoi aussi, j'ai tendance \u00e0 rester discr\u00e8te lors de r\u00e9unions. Je vois des choses \u00e0 propos des gens et des situations qu'ils ne voient m\u00eame pas eux-m\u00eames. Cela me vient tout naturellement, je ne fais aucun effort, les d\u00e9tails me sautent presqu'aux yeux. Pour les paroles vraiment tr\u00e8s importantes, on dirait que le temps ralentit, c'est comme si la personne en face de moi d\u00e9filait plus lentement, de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'on fait passer un film en vitesse plus lente. Je sais alors que ce qui vient d'\u00eatre dit venait de ce qu'il y a de plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 chez cette personne, et que cela a probablement orient\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es de projets et de comportements. Ces paroles s'impriment dans ma m\u00e9moire, et j'en contemple la beaut\u00e9 pendant des ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s les avoir entendues.\n\nD'autre fois, j'apper\u00e7ois le visage de certaines personnes briller lors d'une rencontre. Un peu comme dans le film \"Twilight\", quand la lumi\u00e8re frappe la peau d'un vampire. Cela m'en dit alors un peu plus \u00e0 propos de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de leurs \u00e9motions ou de leurs propos.\n\nLes discrets ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement synonymes d'absence de leadership, ou de \"mall\u00e9abilit\u00e9\", comme tu l'as si bien indiqu\u00e9. C'est juste qu'ils font les choses diff\u00e9remment. En fait, ils poss\u00e8deraient autant de pouvoir, sinon plus, que les personnalit\u00e9s port\u00e9es \u00e0 s'ext\u00e9rioriser plus facilement. La premi\u00e8re qualit\u00e9 du leadership \u00e9tant de savoir observer et \u00e9couter, il arrive souvent que celles et ceux qui passent leur temps \u00e0 parler n'ont pas de capacit\u00e9 d'\u00e9coute tr\u00e8s \u00e9tendue.\n\nTon commentaire est une note d'espoir. Les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations actuelles de jeunes se dirigent vers davantage d'unit\u00e9?

Had I not been referenced in this thread, or read statements that seem to be contradictory of the current set up, I wouldn't have necessarily entered this discussion at this stage.\u00a0\n\nThe most relevant point is this and why I think the idea of non-execs having oversight is a farce, in the company governance document it reads:\u00a0<span>\u201cOpenness is our best safeguard against opportunistic or misguided behavior. People vote with their feet: if the kernel abuses the community, the community will evaporate, and the kernel will be left without a viable company. They definitely don\u2019t want that! But what happens if they don\u2019t notice something is wrong? Or if there is a major disagreement? If somebody else does something stupid that threatens your project as it unfolds? Our second safeguard is the board of directors. We are giving it statutory powers to overrun management and act as benevolent dictator when it perceives a threat. At the moment they are: \u00c1sta Helgad\u00f3ttir Vinay Gupta\u201d </span>\u00a0\n\nWe're both aware that this has been contradicted or undermined, as I've witnessed both in the admin forum and in Georgia @hexayurts guidance and oversight be disregarded by execs. Whilst at LOTE4 one of the executive directors in the final meeting told a non-exec director to \"shut up\". I think it's important given this track record that there is a very clear re-clarification on what this role is for and what anyone signing up might actually expect. I signed up to ER and have continued to participate and contribute to ER on the basis that there wouldn't ever be a concentration of power - that exists now in the form of future and existing contracts, technical rights over the platform and personal objectives overriding individuals work.\n\nAs it stands, I have experienced personal attacks from exec's, witnessed defamation of character, been approached by EdgeRyders both working on unMonastery and from the broader community reporting issues with ER LBG and I've had to personally put energy into repairing professional relationships that were burnt by ER LBG directors. As the governance structure sets out, I have voiced these to both execs and non-execs of ER LBG - though nothing seems to have come of this.\n\nI would be happy to work towards better processes, alternative structures and a general reassessment of how things have shifted over the past few years, but any attempt to do that is generally shouted down, and I am generally disenfranchised by things like having my technical admin rights taken away, and being asked to capitulate or reprioritise on behalf of many peoples work.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe point is, as you rightly say in your last sentence, that a lot of trust has been damaged, and people have \"voted with their feet\" - and their doesn't seem to be any interest in resolving those trust issues, except superficially. I am sorry this is the case.\u00a0\n\nWhen it comes down to continual damage to years of work - it's simply not enough to put this down to personal fights or disagreements.\u00a0\n\nBut clearly this is viewed as a waste of time, and concern about nothing, so I'll take a step back, as I'd prefer not to invoke in anyone else the same frustration and upset I feel about this situation.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-07 13:18:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:38.948100", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 648, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28850], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58095, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 10557, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Just introduce yourself, showing that you are aware of who they are. \"You are probably here for work reasons, like I am, but you are still welcome.

The flow of information has never been higher, more diverse or more accessible to almost everyone. While this is a positive thing, I also think that there are some downsides to it that can prove to be quite worrying.\n\nI only own a facebook page, although my friend keeps telling me to make a twitter account as well. It is very tempting, I will admit, but when I see how much of an important part of my life facebook has become, I feel like having a twitter account would only take away more of my time. But I will probably cave... as it has happened with facebook. At the beginnig, as embarassing as it may be, \u00a0I used facebook only to play different games. It wasn't until after some time that I actually realised all the benefits that this social network could bring. Not only could I see what my friends were up to, but I could also receive a constant flow of news from different newspapers, televisions or celebrities. Quite quickly I became more and more attached to it and ever since I came to the UK, it has proved to be my main tool of communication with friends from back home but also with the friends that I made here.\u00a0\n\nBecause it is my personal facebook page, I try to friend people that I actually know. In terms of other facebook pages, I find really helpful to \"like\" certain pages that have useful information and provide my news feed with important and relevant information. I can read newspapers from Romania, from the UK, from France or from Spain, they are all a click away.\u00a0\n\nThe dangers in terms of personal facebook pages are, in my opinion, first of all the fact that it tends to make us sell ourselves. We only upload the best pictures so we can get more \"likes\" and it all becomes a sort of a popularity contest. I've recently read a study which said that facebook can make us depressed, because people usually upload pictures depicting them being cheerful. Of course people like to smile for the camera, but when you see pictures of your friends smiling it leads you to believe that they are happier than you are and consequently that they have a better life than you do. Which is absolutely misleading and even dangerous for people that are already struggling. On the contrary, people that spent less time on the virtual social network were less likely to believe that they are unhappy.\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, social networking has several advantages, especially marketing-wise. It is time and money consuming, and it allows basically anyone to promote himself. Because me and one of my friend are setting up a website with film news, we are surely going to use facebook a lot as a promotion tool and most probably I will also get a twitter account by the time the website is ready to help promoting it. I think this will allow us to make it more popular and ultimately turning it into a brand.\n\nThe dangers of centralised social networks is that it gives too much power to only a handful people who have access to several of your personal details, pereferences, making you again only a number in a statistic, just a consumer profile, \u00a0as it always happens when the interests of the few lead the interests of the many.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-08 16:07:43", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 13:23:30.154185", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 620, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 45.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29955, "user_id": 393, "topic_id": 647, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>Sensitivity and emotional processing</b>\n\nFascinating thread.\n\nOne question that strikes me is: shouldn't this be precisely what art school is about?

Everyone participating is asked to frame something that could have been done better by not assigning responsibility or blame (e.g. my session started late because x was unpolite and took over the room) but by thinking how to make it better (the schedule was not followed. we need to assign tasks so that there are 2 people responsible to make sure time is kept).\n\nThe community call will result in a collection\u00a0of failures through two iterations:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>A\u00a0collectively written wiki/ blog post calling for additions and improvements [immediately after]</li>\n\n<li>Integrated inputs in a thorough writeup [a week/ two weeks later]</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nSee you on google hangouts on Monday afternoon at 5PM CET? \u00a0<a href=\"https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/3m2tf7cn34xww45rkij2mab5rqa\">CLICK HERE to join!</a>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c4c276ccef06f6fc24a9f68901c9cace3ab093bd.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\">\n\n<em>Photo at \\#LOTE5 by CommunalSpoon</em>\n\nDate: 2016-03-07 18:00:00 - 2016-03-07 19:00:00, Europe/Brussels Time.", "created_at": "2016-03-03 14:46:19", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:31.129486", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 341, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23624, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 5417, "post_number": 13, "raw": "Monday should be fine too\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-24 15:50:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:11.098739", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25764, "user_id": 1839, "topic_id": 2470, "post_number": 25, "raw": "thanks, nice to meet you! :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-10 19:51:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:22.193878", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 7, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25746], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24019, "user_id": 1458, "topic_id": 2154, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>All details</b>\n\nWe'd like to prepare a twitterstorm following the precise planning you are used to.

Two of the UniBas students presented a soundscape using tapes culled from interviews in the Piccianello neighbourhood in the workshop rooms of the unMo1. \u00a0While most of the unMoaners were putting the finishing touches to the satellite space, Viral Academy hopped in with a kitchen crew that provided a thoroughly fitting atmosphere on perhaps the year\u2019s first lovely warm summer night. \u00a0The party rolled into the night while the unMo crowd tried for an early night. \u00a0Next morning was for dress rehearsal of the in-house components. \u00a0The seminar participants were to be marched through the unGuided tour and then meet up with the \u2018Mapping the Commons\u2019 work demonstrations. </span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Tactics</span></span>\n\n<span><span>International unMonasterians cannot be expected to grasp a second, third or fourth language over night. \u00a0Any attempt to facilitate our way to deep analytical understanding is not going to bear immediate fruit. \u00a0It is therefore useful if actions and deliverables are social in nature: people moving into unfamiliar groupings to meet one another under the illumination of whatever inventive context that we can serve up. \u00a0Most of the facilitation occurs in the second generation: people to people.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>Actions</span></span>\n\n<span><span>We struggled a bit with a name. \u00a0The generic \u2018</span><span>Mapping the Commons\u2019 p</span><span>roposed for the grand scheme of things was not at all translatable. \u00a0Everything else we came up with reflected nefarious colonial ambition. \u00a0Finally we fell upon a description of the simple fact: \u201c</span><span>A Day in Piccianello\u201d</span><span>; it promised no more than a solitary, almost coincidental crossing of paths.</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>\u201cUna Giornata a Piccianello\u201d</span><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sabato 24 Maggio</span></span>\n\n<span><span>- \u00a0Laboratorio a piedi: Puoi mappare con un App?</span></span>\n\n<span><span>- Yoga e Kung Fu \u2013 prova libera </span></span>\n\n<span><span>- Poesia a piedi su Piccianello</span></span>\n\n<span><span>-</span><a href=\"http://matera.unmonastery.org/it/projects/unguide\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span> </span><span>Giro insolito di Piccianello</span></a></span>\n\n<span><span>- Musica live con il gruppo Allabb\u00f9n!</span></span>\n\n<span><span>- Presentazione dal progetto Mapping the Commons</span></span>\n\n<span><span>----- Pranzo!----</span></span>\n\n<span><span>- Workshop per il co-design del progetto culturale Centro Internazionale dedicato alla narrazione</span></span>\n\n<span><span>- Tradizione d\u2019arte della cartapesta</span></span>\n\n<span><span>- Giro insolito di Piccianello</span></span>\n\n<span><span>- Esibizione della scuola Kung Fu traditional Shaolin Matera \u00a0\u00a0: \u00a0in cooperation with Viral Academy media project</span></span>\n\n<span><span>- Mapping the Commons</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>In a conversation with Rossella Tarantino just before lunch about the demographics of the Piccianello event so far, it was pointed out that the first half of the day became largely for friends -- Afterwards the cumulated effect of having an unMo outpost started to do its work... </span></span>\n\n<span><span>Lunch may not have been more than a glorious picnic for the regulars.

Maybe half the audience were our family - the rest friends of friends in the neighbourhood and passersby delighted to find something happening. \u00a0A small miracle occurred. \u00a0</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>It seems a combination of something low-key and organic made the evening work without PR flags and amplifiers. \u00a0The unMo lights were reduced to candles; the pomp was left to the performers.

With <a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.thelocal.de/money/20120802-44133.html\">property prices in the capital having risen by nearly 40% between 2003 and 2011</a>, it is clear that unless creative ways can be found to better share the city, many of its less affluent residents will eventually be driven out.

After graduation, I spent years working for French and international industrial companies, after which I quit and went on to work in the humanitarian field throughout Southeast Asia. With the arrival of new technologies and the community approach using the Internet to connect people, it became clear to me that there are now widespread and relatively cheap tools of empowerment readily available. Upon my return to Europe, I decided to work on the development of such ideas. This led to the inception of the <a href=\"http://echopen.org\">echOpen</a> project.\n\nThe idea started from a chat among friends, an engineer (Luc) previously employed in the ultrasound industry, a mathematician and physician (Mehdi) and a radiologist (Pierre). We discussed smartphones: widespread devices that are more sophisticated than the computers that sent people to the moon a few decades ago.\n\nHow could we use this technology to improve health care, considering that now almost everyone have one in his/her pocket?\n\nThis idea emerged as a combination of our passion for open technology and community engagement. Using technologies that have existed since the 70s,with a bit of tweaking, are cheap and perfectly functional to make this idea come true. We then give access to these tools and knowledge to anyone interested, and to encourage them to try new things out.\n\nThis is how our mission came about. We plan to develop the very first Open Source, affordable ultrasound probe (echo-stethoscope) dedicated to diagnosis orientation, based on open source hardware and software principles. It will be cheaper than any of the fancy machines you can find on the market. There already are some ultraportable ultrasound scanners out there, but they cost several thousand Euros \u00a0our goal is to divide the price by 10-15 times. This device will be able to produce a medical image that you can then transport to your smartphone or laptop. It\u2019s a device that every health care professional will want to carry in their pocket - allowing for faster and more accurate diagnosis orientation, which means faster and better medical care. As a preventive tool, it will reduce the number of patients who need emergency help. It can save the lives of mothers who die in developing countries during their pregnancies. Our tool will also spark more interactions between professionals and patients.\n\nWe launched the project in late 2014, but the actual work really began in August 2015. Hosted by the hospital Hotel Dieu, right next to the Notre Dame in Paris, we have an open space with an interesting, eclectic ecosystem of researchers, community members, senior professionals working in the technical and medical areas of ultrasound technology, radiologists, experts in echography, medical laboratories, universities, and schools, etc.\n\nEarlier this year, we developed a functional prototype of the tool - it works, but the quality of the image is not satisfactory. With the involvement of more than 200 people, mostly from France but also in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, we are now improving the quality of echOpen. Our deadline to complete the new medical-quality prototype is this December.\n\nOur project has been supported by the Fondation Pierre Fabre, which believes in our approach and that our concept could be used in Africa, where doctors lack medical imaging devices. They provide financial support and other resources - and the more we have, the faster and more efficiently we can do our work.\n\nWe are constantly looking for both funding and new profiles to get involved within the community, anyone from developers, to designers, engineers, legal experts, and community managers. We are also working on making our wiki more accessible to English-speaking members.

I\u2019m a keen cyclist for transport and leisure, but my profession is also research in devices enhancing the mobility for people with physical limitations. Therefore I feel an obligation to spread the news about recent advancements in cycling for physically challenged. Have you heard about FES cycling?\n\nFES -<a href=\"/t/fes-for-foot-drop/667\"> short for functional electrical stimulation</a> - can be used to activate paralyzed muscles by impulses imitating the nervous system in the most natural way possible. We have come a long way with our research and it is possible to use this technique to let people with paralyzed legs cycle again. For some reason there are very few people who know about this so I\u2019d like to share this knowledge with you.\n\nWe cycle to move, but also to maintain fit. It can be both fun and functional. But, if your legs don't obey you anymore, you will probably not consider it a possibility. Paralyzed legs can result from an accident breaking your back, a stroke or a sneaking disease like the multiple sclerosis. \u00a0\n\nPeople caring for and curing you need to be very pragmatic, and you with them. Mobility then becomes reduced to passive transport, a dietetic approach to avoiding getting fat and medication of pressure sores and other side effects from lack of physical exercise. That\u2019s where the <a href=\"/t/doctor-could-you-hack-me-a-neuroprosthesis-please/483\">publicly unknown FES research comes into play</a>. Years of clinical research have consolidated the benefits, but we need to spread the news and understand more about it. Some people may already have heard of handbikes. They allow you to cover greater distances than manual wheelchairs. They are special tricycles where you use the hands for pedaling.\n\nFES, on the other side, is applied via adhesive electrodes or incorporated in bicycle shorts. The stimulus activates the muscles of the buttocks and thighs in sync with the ride. \u00a0However only the leg muscles can challenge the cardiovascular system to get physically fit. Some people with for example spinal cord injury (paraplegia) may be able to use FES for activating these large muscles. \u00a0With FES cycling they can cover greater distances with greater speed and due to activation of large muscles they get (bene-)fit and feel physical well-being. The research community has tried to promote a more widespread use of FES cycling by arranging <a href=\"http://www.cybathlon.ethz.ch/en/the-disciplines/fes-race/fes-teams.html\">races</a> (see <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Rx9I_hYqQcM?t=64\">here</a>) and publications with the user's statements of the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aor.2002.26.issue-3/issuetoc\">pros and cons</a>\u00a0(see <a href=\"http://www.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/research/impdev/fits/fes-cycling.htm\">here</a>).\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aa450aa4854da962804fe9788f12fe8b5b20e452.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"319\">\n\n<strong>How can we build research into practice or at least make options much more accessible?</strong>\n\nThe question is how to help people who have become paraplegic or their families know about the existence of such possibilities. FES bikes are quite expensive so <a href=\"http://www.berkelbike.com/\">where to go to try them</a>? Many places and cycle lanes are missing so it requires some changes to infrastructure as well. But as long as nobody uses them it's a vicious circle. Therefore we need more awareness to reduce cost, change infrastructure and increase inclusion in the cycle community\n\nEven handbikes which are more popular can\u2019t be bought in a normal bicycle shop, but rather directly from a few specialized companies. The lack of marketing incurs high costs to manufacturers and hence to clients.\n\nMy own group\u2019s response as research and practitioners is to <a href=\"http://wehandu.it/\">create a culture to promote this change</a>, a project in the making. How can we promote actual experience based dialogue between users (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1525-1594.2002.06936.x/epdf\">who are maybe hackers</a>) and researchers? There is an <a href=\"http://www.ifess.org\">international community of researchers, so there should be a good chance of </a>of <a href=\"http://www.cybathlon.ethz.ch/en/about-us/the-board.html\">finding local experts</a>. As someone with a disability, you could connect with them and hack - evolve - test collaboratively cheap functional solutions in a <a href=\"/t/wehandu-maker-space-for-developing-solutions-for-cases-of-motor-impairment/687\">healthcare hacking space</a>. <a href=\"http://www.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/research/impdev/fits/fes-cycling.htm\">Dr Fitzwater</a>, who is both a researcher and FES cycler, reports on the need to make benefits enjoyable in addition to positive medical outcomes: \u201cThe FESC function should be capable of being used on the open road with or without friends and family and be easily usable without any more assistance than that already required for the activities of daily living\u201d.\n\nWhy should you, me or anyone care about the future of research? you want to see your tax money spent well, don\u2019t you? And most importantly, this could be you or a relative who would like to go for a ride and have drastically limited options. <a href=\"http://www.cybathlon.ethz.ch/en/the-disciplines/fes-race/fes-teams.html\">Check out the coming cybathlon for more information and help us spread the news</a>.\n\n<em>The production of this article was supported by <a href=\"/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296\">Op3n Fellowships</a> - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.</em>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-20 16:16:37", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 05:11:43.273248", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1045, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 215.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62090, "user_id": 5185, "topic_id": 11133, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Na tyle na ile zauwa\u017cy\u0142em, Polacy istotnie u\u015bmiechaj\u0105 si\u0119 mniej ni\u017c mieszka\u0144cy Zachodu.

Ben can't be part of the consortium with institutional hat because as a post doc he's legally bound to work on 1 specific project for the next 2 years. Would enjoy being involved in other capacity.\n\nGuy Melancon - is Ben's former PhD coordinator; He thinks LABRI in Bordeaux could be acting as a lead partner in the consortium.\n\nMarco Manca - CERN (Dept of Development and Innovation, and Medical Application Office); is also president of the <a href=\"http://www.scimpulse.org\">Foundation SCImPULSE</a> working to improve human condition. Would be entering the consortium with the latter.\n\nStefano Maffei and Beatrice Villari - working in the Design Dept. at University of Milan and already involved in 2 other EU projects - warning that it's very time consuming! would be focusing on the service design part of the project, but also have experience in policy e.g. on the system connection between public sector policy and citizen approaches to health problems\n\nErik Lakomaa - works in Dpt of Business Administration and Economic History at Stockholm School of Economics; although we initially intended SSE to be a lead partner, their dpt. advises not to get involved in such a project without someone with more capacity to lead.\u00a0\n\nWe therefore need to look elsewhere for a lead in the consortium: Marco's proposal is <a href=\"http://www.ncl.ac.uk/kite\">KITE of the Business School of University of Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, with due experience\u00a0(to drop them an email to ask with Concept note). If not, another option is to re-visit discussions we had at Edgeryders with Wuppertal Institute in Germany,\u00a0or other tips we have (Lulea University of Technology in Finland.. etc.)\n\n<strong>Questions and how to move forward:</strong>\n\nWhat kind of institutional participation can we involve in the consortium, especially to do the real management of the work process? Two months is quite a short time to develop the proposal. Edgeryders can only do soft coordination in the beginning until we find a lead. Erik thinks we need to get someone with EU funding experience onboard real soon, and Stefano agrees. One option is to find a European consultant for this (could anyone develop on terms here? what would it mean, how much would it cost?)\n\n<strong>Actionables:</strong>\n\nEdgeryders to put together drafts and circulate the following docs:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Overview of partners capacities in the project (would be then refined by each partner)</li>\n\n<li>Process of writing up the proposal : an imaginative exercise, from more abstract levels to more specific.

Open referred to the information flow: a system is open when the information on which it is based are open. This can happen when these information are totally visible, accessible and transferable to other systems.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Open Care</h2>\n\nConsidering the different meanings of \u201ccare\u201d and \u201copen\u201d, in my view, there is a clear correlation between 1 and A, and between 2 and B:\n\nA1 Open care refers to the final result. That is, it refers to the characteristics of the care system we intend to create: a care system where different actors (experts and non experts) are in condition to play a relevant role.\u00a0\n\nB2 Open care refers to the design/production process. That is, it refers to the characteristics of a co-design and co-production process: the process leading to the realization of the products and services on which an aimed care system is based.\u00a0\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Our discussion\u2026</h2>\n\nFor what I have understood until now the general motivation for the research (see the Open Care research introduction) seems to mainly refer to A1, where the consortium profiles and experiences are mostly linked to the B2.\u00a0\n\nIn my view, at this stage of the Open Care research we should take a clear decision: do we want to deal with A1, with B2 or with both, A1+B2.\u00a0If the choice is for A1+B2, we should clearly define when, where and how we will discuss of A1 and when, where and how of B2.\u00a0\n\nNB: The following Notes mainly refer to open care assuming the A1 meaning.\u00a0\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Care</h2>\n\nSince the beginning of human history, care has been exchanged (given and received) inside homogeneous, durable and relatively closed groups of individuals: families, clans, village communities, urban neighborhoods ...\u00a0In the past century, in parallel to that, care has been delivered also by dedicated institutions: hospital, kindergartens, elderly residences... \u00a0\n\nToday, for several reasons, the demand of care is growing and becoming more complex, while both the traditional and the modern offer of care are less and less capable to cope with it. In fact, in the present fluid, hyper individualized societies, families, village communities and urban neighborhoods are weakening (if not totally disappearing) and individuals, given their life structure, have less and less practical possibilities to take care of others (even when, in principle, they would do it).\u00a0\n\nIn turn, care institutions, which were supposed to substitute the traditional community\u2019s and individual\u2019s care, have less and less economic resources (and often political will) to do it.\u00a0\n\nThe gap between the growing demand and the shrinking offer of care is the basis of the present care crisis: a lack of care that is not only practical (the caring system do not succeed in coping with the care demand), but also psychological (the sense of loneliness deriving by the lack of sense of care throughout the whole society).\u00a0\n\nTo overcome this crisis a brand new care systems has to be imagined and enhanced. To move in this direction, a first step is to better understand caring activities, considering their nature and diversity.\u00a0\n\n<em>The practical/organizational side of care is particularly important because care is not only exchanging information and knowledge. Care asks also for proximity and action: doing something for each other, taking time and being committed.</em>\n\n<strong>Care activities</strong>. Care activities are quite diverse: they can be performed by whoever could be willing to do it (as to make the shopping for somebody who is momentary sick); they can require a lot of time, attention and assumption of responsibility (as to take care of the daily life necessities of somebody seriously ill); they can require timely actions by highly specialized experts (as surgery interventions in very specific moments). And so on. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn general terms, these differences are characterized by a set of main parameters, as:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Time: duration, frequency, flexibility, \u2026</li>\n\n<li>Space: virtual, hybrid, only physical, \u2026</li>\n\n<li>Competences: normal everyday life socialization, specific diffuse knowledge, specialized expert knowledge, \u2026</li>\n\n<li>Responsibility: very low; low, high, very high.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nDifferent care actions should be attentively analyzed and mapped using this kind of parameters. Nevertheless, intuitively, we can already say that different care activities could be delivered by different actors in different modalities.\u00a0\n\n<em>It comes that, to imagine a new care system, we should, first of all, recognize all the potential care givers, considering them as resources: effective care resource (when they are already active) and potential care resources (when they could be activated if some conditions would be given)</em>\n\n<strong>Care resources</strong>. In principle, everybody can care for someone else. He/she can do it in different forms (depending on his/her expertise and time availability), but all of them require attention. In turn, given that attention is a limited resource (each person has a limit in his/hers capability to give attention), this is true also for his/her capability to care. In other word, care (both the expert and non-expert one) is a diffuse but limited resource.\u00a0\n\nPresently, care systems are built on a mix of three main resources:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Institutional care givers (based on professional actors)</li>\n\n<li>Third sector and charity organizations (based on both professional and non professional actors)</li>\n\n<li>Traditional care communities (as families, village communities, urban neighborhoods).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe know that, for different reasons, all of them are in difficulty to cope with the growing care demand. Therefore, the issue is to reshape the system in order to permit to some new potential resources to emerge and become effective resources.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Mainstream and contra trends</strong>. We have said that, in principle, everybody, depending on his/her time and expertise, could give some forms of care. But we can observe that today, in the contemporary societies, this care potential, clashes with the dominant culture and practice: a cultural attitude that, in the name of individual freedom and convenience, tends to assume a careless approach to everything and everyone (the throwaway society extended from things to human relationships). And: a mainstream practice of living that makes difficult to introduce care activities in the daily life (due to work constrains, to the evolution of families and to their being scattered in different places).\u00a0Therefore, given the present structures of family and work, few people can commit to offering care, especially if this requires continuity, high responsibility and duration in time.\n\nNevertheless, several examples tell us that there still are several people who could and would dedicate some time/energy/attention to well defined caring activities - if and when an appropriate enabling system would permit them to do it in a easy and flexible way.\u00a0This limited but diffuse caring availability is the potential resource that the socio-technical innovation should be capable to transform in an effective resource. \u00a0\n\n<em>In other words, thanks to an appropriate socio-technical innovation, it should become possible to cultivate and harvest the limited individual caring resources of broader groups of subjects. That is, to catalyze and coordinate existing but not used care resources could be the key to overcome the care crisis of contemporary societies.</em>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Hypothesis and vision</h2>\n\n<strong>Hypothesis</strong>. If the close (social or institutional) organizations of the past cannot cope with the dimension and complexity of the present demand of care, they must be opened. That is: the care activities must be divided in smaller/lighter tasks, and allocated to a large number of actors, each one giving what he/she is capable/willing to give.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Vision</strong>. Open care is an ecosystem of care-related interactions, characterized by being distributed among a large number of individuals, groups and institutions, with different competence, responsibility and commitment: \u00a0from the highly specialized actors and institutions, to family members, friends and neighbors with no specific knowledge and limited time availability.\u00a0\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Viability</h2>\n\n<strong>Social preconditions and enabling systems</strong>. To be viable, open care requires two main social preconditions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The existence of a large number of other actors (relatives, friends, neighbors) willing to care for someone, even tough they have practical limits (in terms of time and resource availability) to the possibility of doing it.</li>\n\n<li>The existence of dedicated and specialized actors capable to intervene when their competence are (really) needed.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nGiven the previous social preconditions, the open care potentialities are made real thanks to the existence of a technological and organizational system capable to catalyze diffuse resources, coordinate them and give their action the needed continuity. More precisely, this enabling system should:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>match different demands with different offers (in terms of competence)</li>\n\n<li>give different care actions coherence and continuity (by the point of view of the care receiver)</li>\n\n<li>promote and support both relational and the highly effective ones (i.e. the most specialized, professional interventions).</li>\n\n<li>be organically part of a larger systems: the ecosystem of interactions that represents what today we can refer to as a local community.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\">Social innovation and open care</h2>\n\nThe open care viability is based on the existence of a whole stream of social (and socio-technical) innovation that is already moving in a similar direction.\u00a0In fact, in the complexity of contemporary society we can find several promising cases (some of them are still social prototypes, someone else is already arrived to more mature stage). For instance:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Circles of care: groups of citizen sharing a same problem (as: diabetes, allergies, obesity, \u2026 or simply the old age) who mutually support each other, with the supervision of a team of doctors and nurses (a well-known example is the Circle in UK: http://www.participle.net/ageing ).\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Network of care: coordinated networks of family members, friends and neighbors, who share and coordinate their efforts to care for a person with serious problems (a well-known example is Tyze in Canada http://tyze.com )</li>\n\n<li>Intergenerational cooperation: organizations that supports the encounter of young and elderly people mainly around the theme of collaborative living (a well-known example is Prendi a casa uno studente (Take a student at home), in Italy: http://www.meglio.milano.it/pratiche_studenti.htm )</li>\n\n<li>Collaborative inclusion: organizations of migrants and residents collaborating to produce both migrant\u2019s inclusion and social values, for both the migrants and the whole community (an example is: \u00a0Dine with us, in Belgium: http://dinewithus.strikingly.com ) \u00a0\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nConsidering these very diverse examples, we can observe that they present three fundamental common characters: (1) some care activities are delivered by non professional actors; (2) the overall care burden is shared between different subjects; (3) specialized interventions are asked only when they are really needed. \u00a0\n\n<em>These examples are interesting because they give us an idea on how open care components could work. Nevertheless, in my view, they are not yet the full representation of the open care vision. To better approximate it, two steps should be done:</em>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><em>To rethink each one of these service ideas adopting the radically open approach that characterizes the Open Care research.</em></li>\n\n<li><em>To consider the whole socio-technical ecosystem, and to improve it in order to give all of them and a multiplicity of similar ones the possibility to emerge and flourish.</em></li>\n\n</ul>", "created_at": "2016-03-03 10:26:36", "updated_at": "2020-12-13 07:26:59.852976", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2183, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 16.0, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 8, 3154, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62005, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11224, "post_number": 8, "raw": "# NGI General and Festival related:\n\nTeam Communication routines - Who in edgeryders is coordinating what, how and where? what is on individual event organiser for each activity?\n\n1.

Would you replace them all? Can they be 'trained' in some ways, to become aware of their behaviours, can they change and improve themselves? Are there opposition parties in favor of open government? What are their chances of replacing the current government? What guarantees that the next decision-makers to take power will not fail also to integrity?

What would it take, in Spain, to put in place an open government?\n\nIf tomorrow there was an open government in Spain, on which priorities should the citizens collaborate first?

I agree with you, the human being is in accelerated path to evolution .. but cultural evolution .. a cultural evolution that currently is fueled by the astonishing speed of technological change, especially in the last century.\n\nIts possible to read a really good overview of this <i>cultural evolution</i> process here: <a href=\"http://edge.org/conversation/mc2011-history-violence-pinker\">http://edge.org/conversation/mc2011-history-violence-pinker</a> . Reading carefully the Pinker 's overview, we can make an analogy between Maslow 's hierarchy of needs for individuals with a similar hierarchy for the society as a whole, and are able to see through his description, how the society through cultural evolution is progressing in a positive way through this hierarchy. We as a society moved from satisfying the 'physiological' needs, then by 'safety' needs, then by 'love and belonging' needs, and now we are approximately satisfying the 'esteem' needs with the what Pinker is calling the 'Rights Revolutions'\n\nBut we as a society are still far from the stage of satisfying the 'self-actualization' needs as is evidenced by our current crisis of social and ecological lack of sustainability. We as a society are learning to respect and recognize as a right the various differences, such as racial, sexual tendencies, etc., which ultimately form the tissue of our society. But, that means that we are at the 'esteem' needs level, not at the 'self-actualization' one. To achieve the latter, we must learn to respect and recognize as a right (by law), the need of each individual for self-actualization, i.e. living with a sense of autonomy, mastery and purpose. And we must learn to respect and recognize as a right (by law), that our economic structures do not have priority over the need for a healthy and balanced relationship with our planet.\n\nBut we must not forget that from the point of view of <i>biological evolution</i>, biologically and psychologically we are the same homo sapiens that is populating the earth from the last few thousands of years. And this human nature, as Pinker states, \u201ccomprises inclinations toward violence and inclinations that counteract them\u201d. So, all inside of us have more or less the parts of of human nature that militate toward violence:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>There is raw <i>exploitation</i>, that is, seeking something that you want where a living thing happens to be in the way.</li>\n\n<li>There is the drive toward <i>dominance</i>, both the competition among individuals, and the competition among groups for supremacy or preeminence.</li>\n\n<li>There is the thirst for <i>revenge</i>, the kind of moralistic violence that inspires vendettas, rough justice, and cruel punishment.</li>\n\n<li>There is <i>ideology</i> which might be the biggest contributor of all, leading to large-scale violence via a pernicious cost- benefit analysis.</li>\n\n</ul>And also we all have inside a brighter side with the capacity for:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>There is <i>self-control</i>, the ability to anticipate the consequences of behavior, and inhibit violent impulses</li>\n\n<li>There is the faculty of <i>empathy</i>, the ability to feel others' pain</li>\n\n<li>There is the <i>moral sense</i>, which comprise a variety of intuitions including tribalism, authority, purity, and fairness</li>\n\n<li>There is <i>reason</i>, the cognitive faculties that allow us to engage in objective, detached analysis</li>\n\n</ul>So it is true that we are evolving culturally, but we must not forget that our human nature remains essentially intact as that of the homo sapiens who lived in the caves not so long ago. Then we must consciously advance in our cultural evolution, in order to develop those kind of human relationships that will lead to self-realization state of society, promoting development that reinforce our brighter side and weaken the negatives ones. For that we must learn from the past, noting that the continued development of the following factors:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Our sense of community and justice (\u201cstate and justice system\u201d)</li>\n\n<li>Te fair exchange and sharing ('gentle commerce')</li>\n\n<li>Our sense of empathy and care for others (\u201cexpanding circle\u201d)</li>\n\n<li>Our capacity for reflection (\u201cescalator of reason\u201d),</li>\n\n</ul>have been the main factors that have made us positively evolve culturally through this hierarchy of needs for the society as a whole.\n\nAnd I'm agree with you, we should approach to the technology with the lenses of sharing and caring, not the fear. In order to use the technology with the aim of further developing in a positive way the above factors, and thus helping to walk in a consciously and reflective way, and through real conversations about things that matters, to that state of self-realization in our living together.\n\nP.S.\n\nAnd we also should take the technology with a grain of salt .. it is wonderful and is here to stay .. but not all is good (<a href=\"http://www.edge.org/conversation/infinite-stupidity-edge-conversation-with-mark-pagel\">http://www.edge.org/conversation/infinite-stupidity-edge-conversation-with-mark-pagel</a>) .. and is not the panacea for all (<a href=\"http://www.gladwell.com/2010/2010_10_04_a_twitter.html\">http://www.gladwell.com/2010/2010_10_04_a_twitter.html</a>) .. we should also develop and trust in our old and inherent human need of being in physical touch, face to face conversations and enjoying our planet ..\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-06 15:22:36", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:05.802054", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1145, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63933, "user_id": 4683, "topic_id": 11503, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Dear All - the Moderator was up to the challenge to bring the very disparate elements somewhat into mutual contact.

Little attention has so far been given to the fact that there must be a collective instinct governing the social and political behavior of the species, as there is in every other form of gregarious life.\u00a0\n\nI am glad that Andres raised this question.\n\nThe various systems of government current today are all based on arbitrary theories and doctrines, or imitations of ancient models, without any sanction from nature and without any established connection between the instinctual requirement and the pattern in force. Whether it is democracy, dictatorship, monarchy, oligarchy or any other form of government, it is in no case the outcome of exhaustive study and experimentation on the part of an impartial, wise body of intellectuals. On the contrary, what we now have is a streaming broth of dynastic rule, arbitrary systems, vested interests, individual opinions, doctrines of revolutionaries, and concepts of politicians based entirely on the conclusions of the intellect, without any relevance of the cannons of nature or the laws of the global intelligence.\n\nProof is provided by the current politically chaotic situation. Democraties, dictatorships, oligarchies, military rules, etc., are all grappling with each other like a noisy group of wrestlers. Had the various forms of government been in accordance with the instinctual model or universal law, the puppt dance (which was beautifully described by Vinay Gupta. Ref \"<a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/bring-allies/mission_case/fighting-muppetocracy\">Fighting the Muppetocracy</a>\"), would not then be an unedifying feature of life today.\n\nThe insipid drama of forced laughter, sardonic smiles, jack in-the-box appearances before the media, behind-the-back intrigues, and other embellishments of the black art of politics (how often have I talked about the Shadow of Leadership?), which is now an inseparable ingredient of the political structure, would not be there to regale a disenchanted public now satiated with such performances.\n\nWe (humanity) have blundered in attaching excessive importance to the physical wants of man as compared to his spiritual needs. Our aims have been to surround mankind with every comfort, every facility, and every luxury we could think of or devise, leaving the soul out of count. And this effort continues to this hour. The human mind, imbued with the idea that success, high position, ease and comfort, abundance and affluence are the<em> summum bonum</em> of life with no higher aim, burrowing like an earthworm deep into the soil of ambition, greed, and lust for power. By no means can a mind set solely on this course if one becomes possessed with the idea that success and abundance are the only means by which one can win the battle of life.\n\nIt is not necessary to dwell more closely on the darker side.\n\nThis is what the Edgeryders are whispering gently to our ears.\n\nThe plan of nature is to evolve the brain in order to embellish the mind, and to confer a supersensory channel of perception on the race. I know what that plan of nature is, because I experience it in my body. I feel the force of re-birth. In Indian wisdom, the deity ruling human evolution is know as the Goddess Kundalini. It is a feminine power. (And by the way, we currently live in a patriarcal society. There is not even a gender equity between men and women. I read it will be reached some time, in approximately 150 years.)\n\nSince the two aims collide, disaster threatnes the existing order to open way for nature's benevolent plan to materialize. This is exactly what our system is on the verge of: disaster.\n\nWhat the Internet is doing, is that it has changed our perception of ourselves. We no longer perceive that we are a separate self, we perceive that we are all connected to each other with social media links. However, there exists invisible links that connect us to everything, that we are not aware of yet, there exists a global intelligence. Internet is helping us to become more aware of its existence.\n\nScience is irresistibly coming to the conclusion that the observed phenomena of the physical world cannot be separated from the observer.\n\nEdgeryders participants, via an Internet platform, are showing to the Council of Europe government organisation that they are focusing on other aims than attaching excessive importance to the physical wants. They talk about creating, sharing, learning, foregiving, etc, I described how it is possible to achieve a new physical state of consciousness, that occurs after the body undergoes a huge transformation in order to physically support higher states of consciousness.\n\nOnly the global intelligence has the operational software necessary to bring us to use our full capacity. A mind filled with this global intelligence will create harmony, unity, cooperation, understanding, and will become a vortex, a channel through which universal awareness can flow into this physical world.\n\nWhat we can observe, at Edgeryders, is that these qualities and skills are being learned by youth, because these young people are tapping into the global intelligence, through their intuition and creativity. What the experimental Edgeryders project is showing us is that governments can learn to consciously manage the collective intelligence, by aligning their policies and projects on the laws of nature.\n\nThe crux of the matter is not only whether the human species will survive (the crazy ecological destruction we have done, or the nuclear age threat), but even more whether it can survive without falling into a state of worthless existence. Every human being is a helpless victim to a ceaseless inner deterioration situation on account of the pernicious political and social system. The world situation has assumed an urgency that no sensible human being can ignore any longer.\n\nThank you Andres for this mission report.

While at SoCap I wrote a list of everything the funders and investors mentioned they needed, it is as follows:\n\n-new forms of enterprise + their legal structures\n\n-incubators\n\n-social investment funds\n\n-a new political agenda\n\n-cross sectoral pro-action\n\n-public engagement\n\n-new support structures\n\n-simplification of collaboration\n\n-new solutions to social challenges\n\n-new markets\n\n-biospheric identity integration\n\n-creativisation of social enterprise\n\n-more communication\n\n-credit and value distribution systems\n\n-defragmentation of efforts\n\n-faster and more efficient action\n\nThis list comes from notes taken at talks from Unlimited, the socent investment intermediary, Bamboo Finance, the Aga Khan foundation, SoCap, Toniic (SF based angel investor network), Group SOS (France), The Hub network, various energy tech socents, Adelphi, LGT Venture Philanthropy, Voxtra, Corporate Finance, the Swedish International Developoment Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the Swedish Social Enterprise forum, Unitus and various individual speakers. It should be taken into account that there were simultaneous sessions and so this is by no means an exhaustive list, it does however shed light on the common feeling both in Europe and in America as to the nature of the situation.\n\nThere were also a number of important issues that seemed to pop up again and again, these included:\n\n-experiencing inequality directly\n\n-the direction and balance of capital\n\n-the development of enabling and connective infrastructure\n\n-trust, proof of impact/deliverance\n\n-defining socents\n\n-the dependence on short term political arrangements and holders of office\n\n-the dependence on the financial markets and the problems faced by this\n\n(socent and the like are hinged on trends in the financial markets, what effects the latter effects the former) \n\n-state to socent investment where the state gets a return of the initial investment ( not just feasibility grants etc) \n\nReflection on this is well advised, is there a tide to lift all of these boats? \n\nAnd now the funding tool.\n\nI would suggest the development of a legal structure to base a funding tool by which shared value/practice   communities  and/or  networks/networked representatives can draw funding down from investors. This will require a rethink in terms of 'return' , 'concessionary returns' , and ownership in general. The ideal would be user owned networks acting according to the economics of social business (Yunus) wherein individuals and groups can create social enterprises (for profit + social good) to service the network by proposing viable resources and services to their network via an 'equity crowd funder' (creating shareholdership of the Enterprise among the funders)  \n\nInfo graphic explaining  the potential equity crowd funding scenario: \n\nhttp://www.crowdfunder.com/equity-crowdfunding-infographic.html\n\nIn the 'business as usual' model investment always comes down from above and so we have seen the institutionalisation of the interest of capital holders. This model adds a bottom up aspect to the investment relationship. To explain we can take the example of Unlimited as layed out by Joan at the SoCap conference. Acting as an intermediary, Unlimited have a portfolio of angel investors who collectively identify the top 25 social entrepreneurs in England annually, they add force to the talents of these people by publicly identifying them as high potential actors and guarantee any investment made in their enterprises with a promise of equal investment, a one from you, one from me arrangement. This does two things, it legitimises the social entrepreneur, and it amounts to shared risk among the investors. \n\nNow think again on the equity-crowdfunding potential counterpart to this model. If investors are trying on the one hand to reduce, and on the other, to share risk, then it follows that through identification of the market, before the fact, as well as partnership of public/crowd funding and private investment, the 'risk' is shattered and the investment is shared. Through the equity, and thus  shared ownership of the developing enterprises, there is a building of trust between the private and the public involved as there is a shared ownership in which the worker-owners are no longer working solely for the profit of external investors,but are working also for themselves and for their community/network. This is a hybrid model, the necessary step between straight capitalism according to self interest and capitalism according to shared inter-esse, it is neither one or the other (granted - capitalism has no foothold in the latter).\n\nI have thought a lot about how this tool might be of use and it would appear that it requires some kind of network aggregation tool that makes it easy for people to identify others sharing their values, practices and proffessional and social modes. A network aggregator can be built rather easily' and in such a way as to lead people to find one another and group according to location, practice, fields of interest and study, passion, inspiration and so on; but this is no good without an adequate method of tipping the platform on a global scale.  This is where the 'cultural sector' come in. We all like culture, we enjoy languages and art and spirituality of some kind (even defending its non-existence is a kind of spirituality;) or of many kinds, and so if looking to reach the broadest audience we need a diverse approach through many channels. We know the worlds or our immediate involvement, and still we are trying to create something that is inclusive, it's not enough only to work with policy makers, precariats, entrepreneurs, or any other group. \n\nOver the last years I have been looking into 'supra-cultures' and their ecologies, mostly for fun. There are dancers, African and jazz, contemporary and hip hop, there are all of the halls of academia, there are the per formative arts, the physico-spiritual arts, spiritual communities, energy tech workers, tech wizards, designers and programmers, visual artists and filmmakers, musicians of so many varieties acoustic and electronic...the list goes on. All of these practices have in common that they are not locationally specific, and are in the general sense, transnational communities of practice, or they would be if they were sufficiently connected. \n\nI reckon these groups are the ones to leverage, and what is very interesting is that often the members most influential and able in these respective communities are cross-pollinating with other cultural groups by virtue of the surge of collaboration we have seen in the past ten years. If this activity and these groups can be rallied, connected, and accommodated, then there is potential for global impact in a short(ish) time frame.\n\nIf any of you want to chat about this further please comment or email me on flipflop.productions(at)gmail.com \n\nThat's it for now, Demsoc, please feel free to take what's written here and make it more digestible, I realise I can make things more complex than they need to be at times, as ever, I'm working on it.", "created_at": "2012-06-24 18:31:13", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:49.290539", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1258, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24923, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 6003, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Tue 12 CET it is.</b>\n\nLooking forward to see you both,\n\nI'm noemi.salantiu\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-05 14:04:11", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:17.941305", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23777], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17161, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5365, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>let's do it</b>\n\nI'm game.

Not a thing!\n\nTherefore, I am tempted to end this mission here.\n\nUh. Why talk, when there's nothing to say?!\n\nBut I'm eager to earn 200 Edgeryders additional points!\n\nThese 200 points will be well-deserved, because I have spared no effort during the past year to bring change in this area.\n\nIn this mission, I will briefly describe, through my own eyes,\n\n1) what has been done so far in Canada;\n\n2) my open government vision\n\n3) open government government projects that I identified, that occurred in connection with my interventions.\n\nI note here in this mission both official initiatives and other efforts, which are more in line with analysis, draft projects, or mere attempts at bringing some change.\n\n<strong>1) EARLY STAGES OF OPEN GOVERNMENT IN CANADA</strong>\n\nThere are initiatives, early stages of open government in Canada, but they occured in most cases outside the province of Quebec. English Canada, that is to say, the nine predominantly Anglophone provinces of Canada, are nicknamed the \"Rest of Canada\", ROC, as opposed to Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nAll of the OFFICIAL open data / open government initiatives occurred in the ROC, with the exception of one - from the City of Montreal -, whose open data initiative is extremely recent. The launch of a new open data portal http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca was announced on October 27, 2011 (http://montrealtechwatch.com/2011/10/28/montreal-open-data/).\n\n<strong>AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL</strong>, the following ROC cities have turned open data: Calgary, Edmonton and Medecine Hat (Alberta), London, Ottawa, Toronto, Mississauga, Windsor (Ontario), Nanaimo and Vancouver (British Colombia). There might be recent initiatives not listed here. If we include Montreal, this gives us a total of about a dozen open data cities. There are 5,600 cities in Canada, 393 of which have a population of 100,000 and over, according to the 2001 census (ref. http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/91f0015m/2007008/t/4054804-eng.htm)\n\nWhich leaves us with no open data city in 10 Canadian provinces and territories: Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.\n\nCanada is a magnificent country, stretching from coast to coast, from Atlantic to Pacific ocean. The dozen or so of open data cities, I see them as oases of openness, in an ocean of culture of silence and secrecy. There is still room for improvement...\n\n<strong>AT THE PROVINCIAL LEVEL</strong>, 16 months ago, in October 2010, Premier Jean Charest of the government of Quebec appointed Henri-Fran\u00e7ois Gautrin, Deputy House Leader, to lead an analysis about the potential of Web 2.0. Ideas and comments from citizens were collected on this public consultation site: http://www.consultationgautrinweb2.gouv.qc.ca. His final report was due on December 15, 2011. But it has been postponed at a later (unconfirmed) date.\u00a0 This report should include recommendations on open government: transparency, participation and collaboration.\n\nIn October 2011, the Gautrin group participated to a conference on democracy, members of parliament and traditional media: http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/actualites-salle-presse/nouvelle/actualite-24303.html\n\nThe Gautrin group produced a very good video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0lUQA5FmXM \u2015 as good as the video created for the launch of Open Government Partnership in New York. (created by Chalifour http://www.chalifour.net/blogue/2011/11/16/gouvernement-ouvert-rapport-gautrin-quebec) But there is no open government official policy yet in Quebec. No announcement has been made in this area.\n\nOne government institution, among the hundred departments and agencies of the Government of Quebec, is preparing an open data project (thanks to the persuasiveness of Edgeryders participant Jeff00720, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gauthier, http://ca.linkedin.com/in/jeanfrancoisgauthier\u00a0 from Loran Technologies).\n\nThe government of British Colombia launched on July 19, 2011 Canada\u2019s first provincial open data site, DataBC, http://data.gov.bc.ca \"We are changing our approach to governing by putting citizens at the centre of our web services and making government data and information more freely available,\" said Premier Clark. \"Open government is about sharing information and giving British Columbians more opportunities to participate in decisions that make a difference in their lives.\" http://www.newsroom.gov.bc.ca/2011/07/open-data-signals-new-direction-for-bc-government.html \u00a0\n\nI love this video of Christy Clark, where she talks about open government in British Colombia. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pq6V40uQYY\u00a0 For me, this video is the equivalent of images of the first men who walked on the moon. It was the first time I saw a Canadian prime minister talk about these issues. I am glad a woman prime minister took the lead.\n\nIn March 2011, Government in the Lab reported in its newsletter http://govinthelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Newsletter-OpenGov-March2011.pdf\u00a0 that Christy Clark committed herself to becoming \"the most connected and responsive prime minister in Canadian history\". \u00a0\n\nBetween March and July 2011 (less than 5 months), Ms. Clark succeeded in leading the province of British Columbia to an open government policy.\n\nGovernment projects should not last more than three months, recommended Beth Noveck on March 2nd, 2011, at the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics (ETHI) of the House of Commons of Canada. \"If possible, promote innovations that can be implemented within 90 days or less. Requires organizations to act more quickly discouraged bureaucracy and encourage the creative brainstorming and innovation.\" (ref http://govinthelab.com/testimony-before-the-standing-committee-on-access-to-information-privacy-and-ethics-of-the-canadian-parliament-2)\n\nI do not like comparisons, but I cannot help thinking that it has been 16 months since the province of Quebec has been conducting analysis on open government. During all this time testing and analysis were undertaken, nothing really tangible happened. We are still awaiting the announcement of initiatives and projects. Meanwhile, another provincial government managed to reach sensational results in just a few months, with little budget, and small teams.\n\nIt is worthwhile to note the leadership of Ms. Clark. She made an open government promise. Once elected, she said, 'I promised this, let's do it.' And no objection failed, everyone in her government followed her. British Columbia has developed the right formula that works and gives positive results.\n\nI keep repeating that higher spheres leaders should articulate their vision for public management to be more modern, more transparent --- more open government --- and better connected by a judicious use of virtual environment and new (disruptive) technology. Leaders should formalize, legitimize innovations and support, promote them. This is what is doing the Premier of British Columbia.\n\nAs for the Premier of Quebec, and the rest of his ministers, they have not uttered a word about open government yet. I would like to be there when it comes out of the Premier's mouth! It has been 16 months that teams are actively working on these issues, but there has not been a single press conference from the highest levels, to highlight this work. Do these things matter? One can wonder...\n\nTwo articles about open government were published in Le Devoir in november 2011. To my knowledge, this was the first time that these issues were covered by traditional media (newspaper) in Quebec.\n\n- Gouvernement ouvert: Le Qu\u00e9bec ne manque pas d'exemples \u00e0 suivre\n\nhttp://www.ledevoir.com/societe/science-et-technologie/335411/gouvernement-ouvert-le-quebec-ne-manque-pas-d-exemples-a-suivre\n\n- Gouvernement ouvert: Assembl\u00e9e nationale ferm\u00e9e?\n\nhttp://www.ledevoir.com/societe/science-et-technologie/335410/gouvernement-ouvert-assemblee-nationale-fermee\n\n<strong>AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL</strong>. There are 308 members of parliament at the Canadian federal level, compared to 125 in Quebec. I try to get to know a maximum number of deputies whenever there is a change of government. But for the federal level, the country is so vast that it seems beyond a citizen's reach, hardly possible to influence on any decision.\n\nThe announcement of an open data 12-month pilot period for Canada's national open data site, http://data.gc.ca/, was carried out by Stockwell Day on March 17, 2011 (http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/media/nr-cp/2011/0317a-eng.asp). The next day, he announced an extension to open government (http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/media/nr-cp/2011/0318-eng.asp). 24 new data sets were released in the portal, and 33 other data sets have been added by various departments.\n\nThis news has not been carried over by the Francophone newspapers. Very few Quebecers are aware of this initiative. Also, what does this mean in practice? Few citizens know.\u00a0 What the government is doing in this area has not yet been defined. On December 6, 2011, Tony Clement launched an online consultation on open government and invited Canadians to participate (http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/media/nr-cp/2011/1206-eng.asp). Deadline for citizen participation is January 16, 2011.\n\nI participated to the first Tony Clement's Twitter townhall about open government on December 15, 2011. Elizabeth Thompson quoted participants in this article: http://www.ipolitics.ca/2011/12/16/tony-clements-twitter-town-hall-storified/,\n\n<strong>2) MY OPEN GOVERNMENT VISION</strong>\n\nMy vision of open government is an hybrid partnership \u2015 a transnational integration bridging separate culture and national identities. I believe it would provide an unparalleled instructive and explorative opportunity to develop open government throughout the world.\n\nI\u00a0 do not exactly know yet how to go about breaking cultural regulation (acculturation). I spend my time wondering about how the Anglosphere and Francosphere could become like communicating vessels. It could be achieved if the Francosphere were seen as being \"strong\", if there was equality between the two spheres.\n\nFor the past five years, I did my best to become a living bridge between Anglophones and Francophones. I even edit my blog \u2015 L\u2019\u00c8re du temps \u2015 in 2 languages, which is not even the case of several government institutions. Osmosis attracts me. It is defined as the movement of solvent molecules through a selectively permeable membrane into a region of higher solute concentration, aiming to equalize the solute concentrations on the two sides. I would like to apply this biological system to the open government sphere. I would like to see open government information travel from English to French (and other languages), and vice versa.\n\nDe-facto acculturation of members of my community, through assimilation to a (supposedly) world culture, and negation of cultural identity, I am tired to have to abide to it. For years, I had to actively negotiate the boundaries of cultural separation, assimilation and exclusion, on a daily basis. Therefore, I long for solutions of fusion, inclusion and so on.\n\nI believe that the transnational hyperspace should be an expression of different and evolving cultures and languages. I see that if social media allows for new notions of connectivity, communication and interaction, social media therefore produces and diffuses new cultures. I would like to extend this to open government. Therefore, I came up with the Open Government and Francophonie project: a majority of Francophone States (39) and nearly 1000 of their cities \u2015 a critical mass of governments \u2015 were to get involved in a multilateral partnership.\n\nI often talk about transcendance and consciousness. I aim at ultimately creating a transcultural metamorphosis, transcending different worlds and realities.\n\nRead more my vision of open government http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/longing-open-government\n\n<strong>3) MY EFFORTS TO BRING OPEN GOVERNMENT IN MY WORLD</strong>\n\nTo sum it up, my efforts boil down to having written hundreds of letters \u2015 several emails a week and dozens of tweets a week \u2015 to members of the National Assembly of Quebec. I discussed over the phone or met in person a few of them. I also published blog posts, and hundreds of tweets about the lack of open government in Quebec and Francophonie.\n\nI know from experience that behaving like an old scratched gramophone usually works. Repetition over time of the same message leads me to believe that I have some influence.\n\nNot quite enough, apparently, since there is not yet an open government in Quebec, <span><span>and that</span> <span>my project</span> <span>was not successful. I</span><span>n fact, I</span> realized, </span><span><span>with some horror</span> <span>in the heart, </span></span><span>that I might have <span>created</span> <span>even more</span> <span>blocking</span></span>? <span><span>The final response from</span> <span>my MP,</span> Jean-Paul Diamond, <span>'</span><span>There is no</span> <span>solution'</span>, <span>was so</span> <span>negative and</span> <span>strong that it</span> <span>destroyed</span> <span>all hope.</span></span>\n\n<div class=\"almost_half_cell\" id=\"gt-res-content\"><div style=\"zoom:1\">\n\n<span><span>This</span> <span>ended</span> <span>any further attempt</span><span>. </span></span><span><span>The fence</span> <span>has become</span> <span>impassable.</span> </span>\n\n</div></div>\n\nOver the past year, I insisted about bringing the Francophonie into an open government multilateral partnership. Francophonie here, Francophonie there! It's in my mind, in my heart, and on my lips.\n\nI contacted elected members of parliaments and government managers of several governments: Quebec, Canada, Ontario, British Columbia, French Republic, Belgium, Senegal, United States, Louisiana, Maine; and of these organizations, Association des parlementaires de la Francophonie, Association des maires francophones, Open Government Partnership.\n\nIn collaboration with John F Moore Government in the Lab, I created in December 2010 the Open Government and Francophonie Project.\n\nBy approaching the Quebec government with this project, it allowed me to meet in person the Deputy House Leader Henri-Fran\u00e7ois Gautrin and his team. In February 2011, Mr Gautrin sent us his consultation paper and asked us what we thought about it. There was no question of open government in this document.\n\nFIRST INFLUENCE EFFECT: I have not succeeded to interest the government in our project, but at least I can see the many discussions that John F Moore and I had with the group Gautrin over the subsequent months allowed to influence this team. The principles of open government philosophy have been integrated with brio by the Gautrin group. I have not read the final report yet, but I have no doubt they did a good job. The video I used as supporting evidence. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0lUQA5FmXM\n\nSECOND INFLUENCE EFFECT: The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois promised to turn the government of Quebec into an open government. See this document, Cahier d'animation Changeons la politique http://t.co/3qZtiwIH Because I told about my struggle with the government of Qu\u00e9bec and the City of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (Innovation et d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique) to MP Dave Turcotte, I had many opportunities to talk to him about open government (several phone calls, numerous emails and tweets): he developed an understanding of these issues and communicated them to the party leader and other team members. With this document, Dave Turcotte became the first francophone MP in the world to lead on open government issues. (Hey, I am proud!)\n\nI opened eyes to many people, my actions contributed to raise awareness, I'm sure. I scared many many many members of parliament and many many many government managers, I'm sure of this too!\n\nConsidering the amount of effort that I had to deploy, for so few tangible results, I find it pretty scary. Citizens that want to bring change must have total endurance, foolproof perseverance, to successfully make move forward the complex machinery of a government. It's almost inhuman to ask as much to one frail individual.\n\nThe most difficult thing to accept is that there is no financial benefit for me: I had to export my knowledge and skills in Europe to find work (with the Council of Europe, this Edgeryders project). In all cases, a big thank you to the people of the Council of Europe, you have all my gratitude, first for seeing in me something of value, and second, for encouraging me to talk about my vision and projects.\n\nI sincerely keep hoping that more open government and consolidation of multilateral partnerships will be developed soon.

Euh, \\#justsaying.)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-09 17:58:15", "updated_at": "2017-09-21 11:38:47.860329", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2956, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 20.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22278, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1851, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Links?</b>\n\nHello [Eimhin],\n\ncan you share a link or two?

For the longest time it was very much an offline network even through I can't really remember ever not having socialised online- I guess my existing offline network moved online. To have a resilient and diverse online social network it needs to not consist of people who are too much like yourself. And I think you get there by doing very different things in different contexts in your life. Mm I try to be impartial and reflective as well as to not be associated with any political entity- an independent thinker. I'll generally refrain from expressing my opinions and requests for actions unless it's about something that I know will adversely affect us all and is too unsexy for people to pay attention too unless friends point out that they need to.I am not comfortable with commercial networks knowing much about me-I also think that attempts at controlling the flow of our data are futile due to pervasiveness of surveillance. I manage this by trying to be careful about what I publish about myself.\n\n<strong>Phase 1: First period as independent grown up.</strong> During this phase I was just drifting and kind of bumping into people along the way very excited to be out in the world and friendly and open, giving people keys to my home if I liked them. People were always hanging out at my place or sleeping on the floor of my room after a wild night out, seldom fewer than four people crashing at my place. And I'd cook pasta for everyone. Which is how I came to be living in a commune with some really nice people. It was a point where I was coming out of my shell in terms of my creative urges and started painting and drawing alot more. Over time my network started to change shape, more free-spirited, restless people with jobs that were different from what they were passionate about- jobs in supermarkets, hotels or cafes. And everyone was in at least one band. A lot of of my time was spent in dingy rehearsal studios in the middle of nowhere and gigs in non-descript venues or obscure festivals.\n\n<strong>Phase 2: Get a profession.</strong> At this point I started feeling the pressure to grow up and get a profession. I tried my hand at different professions including working as a cook, really wanted to go to art school and ended up in Engineering uni. My social network started to change, including more students as a result of spending more time in the university building as well as more ambitious creative people outside the academic environment. This was a result of my getting involved in a lot of extracurricular activities, both ones directly tied to developing a professional profile and ones that were just fun like throwing art space parties. I was drawn towards people I could learn from and would just walk up to them and tell them i wanted to learn from them or collaborate on things together.What I was looking for in my relationships at the time was to get things done, make things happen. And I tended to draw people who also were very focused.\n\n<strong>Phase 3: Survival and happiness.</strong> I'm at the phase where I see my social networks as a large chunk of what makes me happy in the world- being surrounded by people I like and respect and feel good around is my main focus at the moment. And that means people who are warm and curious about the world they live in and want to have fun experiencing it with others. It also means trying to build a lifestyle where that joy depends as little on the ups and downs of the world financial doings, or undoings if you like, as possible. And finding people who want to do that too...\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-07 17:02:31", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 13:31:41.958006", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 688, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1570, "user_id": 891, "topic_id": 1537, "post_number": 1, "raw": "It's quite obvious that doing the basic mandatory studies isn't enough anymore. We live in a very competitive and dinamic world, which changes every day. For this reason, I firmly believe that we should do our best to acquire all neccessary skills to resist in this globalised world. But which are those skills?\n\nFirst of all, there are those which I call <u>\"Basic Skills\"</u> - Basic because, without them, we couldn't do anything in the world we live in. And those basic skills are:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>English - it's mandatory. Maybe you will tell me: \"But everybody knows english.\" Unfurtunately it's not true. It's not true, not only because of somebody's negligence, but also because of the inadequate education systems of some countries.</li>\n\n<li>Computer skills - everyone should know how to use the computer, at least at a basic level. Now, for almost every job you have, if you don't know how to use the computer, you are clearly disadvantaged.</li>\n\n</ul>Secondly, there are those skills which I call \"V.I.S.\" (<u>Very Important Skills</u> :-) )\n\nWe must stand out somehow, facing the competitive labor market. For these reason, we should't settle knowing english and having basic computer skills. I think we should:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Knowing at least one rare language, like chinese or arabic. It would be great to focus on those skills which aren't possessed by everybody.</li>\n\n<li>Knowing how to use specific programs on the computer. Clearly, we can't be able to use all specific programs, but if we know something from web design to administrative programs like office package, we are in a very favorable position.</li>\n\n</ul>Then there are those <u>Soft skills</u> which are vital for our current or future job. The soft skills I consider important are:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Team Spirit - I think we all should have team spirit. By team spirit I meam having the capability to listen others' opinions, working with people who apparently have different interests from ours, etc.</li>\n\n<li>Capacity of adaptation in new environments - Here I mean that it's very important to be flexible and open-minded. If you are a good listener and a good collaborator, you can adapt easily in a new work environment and so, be more productive.</li>\n\n<li>Being a good negociator - I think negociation is the key for everything. We all had, at least once, to negociate something . If we are able to do that properly, we are surely in a very advantageus position in the labor market.</li>\n\n</ul>And now the very important question: Who can help us acquiring those skills which we need so much? Well, up to a certain point, school of course. I mean, particulary those technical skills. But, scholl is not enough. It's not enough for tehnical skills and it's clearly not enough for Important Skills or for Soft Skills. Everyone should be proactive, searching always\u00a0 for new sources of learning, being involved in all kind of extra-curricula activities, with other people...in a few words, not settle for less and try to reach a self-improvement.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-29 16:39:41", "updated_at": "2017-09-09 07:39:09.011133", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 546, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 25.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27198, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5699, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>No need for homework :-)</b>\n\nYou're probably right, keeping it in mind and passing it to our <a href=\"/t/edgeryders-dev-testing/331\">open dev group.</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-27 15:12:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:30.403616", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 33, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26613], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32350, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2046, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>Marked done</b>\n\n:-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-20 16:43:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:57.782818", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27444, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4792, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Confirmed</b>\n\nMy man in London (ex-UNDP, now NESTA) has confirmed he is interested.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-11-05 15:40:24", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:31.583459", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 18, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [27299], "is_liked_by": [2951, 8, 2330], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10940, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 2899, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>No we just send out the invitations tomorrow! </b>\n\nTwitterstorm is scheduled for May 12.

But I can't help hacking things :) Not trying the impossible like the environmental economists though. Just a market where price is not the only decision criterion, rather price and reciprocity (and some minor other things).\n\nIn the Graeber example, you have positive coercion (to enter into a transaction). In Makerfox, you have negative coercion (you don't get the transaction <em>even though</em> you have the \"money\" and the other party is willing to sell). Btw, that's also why there is no single \"market price\" in Makerfox: due to the requirement for making alternative orders, different people need to pay different amounts for the same commodity, as required to make things fit into barter trades. I see coercion wherever there are more factors deciding over transactions than simple presence of offer and demand and an agreed-on price. Sure, I see Graeber's point as negative coercion is quite weak, it does not prevent people from leaving the market and joing a non-coerced one. However, they will only do so if the coercion costs them more than the opportunity costs to access or found the new market. That opens the space where the Makerfox can nudge people around.\n\nThis is not enough manoeuvring space to take over a lot of stewardship tasks (except if a state would make network barter obligatory, but would that be beneficial?). So we do not even try. In Makerfox, trading is for physical personal goods and services, but donating is for everything with collective benefits, including everything open source and digital. (Means, it will not be possible to sell software or any other artificially scarce goods on Makerfox, but one can make them into moneyless crowdfunding campaigns there.) If you can <em>use</em> something without pay, you also should <em>pay</em> for it without a transactional connection to use rights. It's just that stewardship-by-donating schemes don't work well if they first require chasing after a scarce resource (money). It could work much better if one can donate time, stuff etc.. We'll have to see.\n\nWhich brings me to a more important point that was probably implied but not expressed in this discussion: while I agree that the commons should be stewarded, it's also true that all practical stewarding\u00a0involves trading. Whenever handling money (or barter value) for a stewardship project, there is market interaction. Whether you accept donations, buy in professional services from an external consultant or rent an excavator to fill back in the Vake Park hole. Commons projects obviously profit from this.\n\nPersonal conclusion: Don't trade the Commons. Trade to build the Commons.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-01-30 21:44:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:38.788303", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 470, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28777], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3653, "user_id": 1450, "topic_id": 3620, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Background: on Sunday, @dorotea, @hazem and @danohu talked a bit about arranging Berlin-based interviews for the stewardship case studies.\n\nWe wanted to choose interviews that would cover different aspects of stewardship, so we could understand it from all angles.

What a fascinating story.\u00a0\n\nThe question of interaction is an interesting one. At this stage in my planning, I don't envisage any direct interaction other than commenting on / sharing the stories that are published via\u00a0social media. This is important in emphasising the privacy and security of the platform when it is launched later in the year. When this happens, people - everyone -\u00a0will be able to create profiles for their own relatives to which invited family, carers and friends can contribute. But these profiles will only be visible to those who have been given permission and, in this context, Remarkable Lives operates as a private family social network. It is also to take in account the sensitivity around the demographic's profile - we're talking about older people in society, some who are vulnerable and for whom privacy needs to be safeguarded.\n\nThat said, there will be the facility for profiles to be made public, for example if someone has created a profile for themselves (imagine an 80-something tech-savvy person) and is happy to be 'found'. In that instance, you would be able to make contact with that person and send a message and, feasibly, begin interacting that way.\n\nI hope this answers your question.\u00a0\n\nOwen\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-08 11:03:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:02.661482", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 243, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10075], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24621, "user_id": 2470, "topic_id": 4746, "post_number": 6, "raw": "The rest of our registration is since long approved (LEAR etc).\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-08-27 09:40:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:16.363943", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25653, "user_id": 200, "topic_id": 1777, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>sorry have had no time</b>\n\n<span>Sorry I have not found the time recently, but if there is anything simple that I can look at and help revise in a few minutes, fine!

It does not suit the larger societal goals to have those who are working together to help manage the coming economic upheavals worry about where their next meal will come or where they will rest their heads.\n\nA model that might work for this is sponsorship in return for a place in a sustainable community. Sponsorship across and between the city and the various linked up resilient communities.\n\nSuppose that Margaret lives in London and has a well-paying job and wants to support the efforts of people like Vinay, but is not yet ready to chuck it all to go build anew in the country. And perhaps she is a member of Hub Webminster and her business revolves around the city so she can't easily move without putting herself into the precarity too which will only add to the problem.\n\nIf things get tough, it may be too late to move to the country. There might be many more people than spaces and those without preexisting ties might not be welcome because there simply won't be enough room or food. So she'd like to have some way of building ties to the community, but she can't do the work that full-time residents would do.\n\nRight now, there are a lot of people hoarding gold in case of calamity, seems much better to establish good human bonds of friendship. You won't be able to buy food with gold if food is in short supply, but your friends will help you if they can, especially if you have helped them build their community to make it resilient. So people will go to the country. How much better will it be to have friends there already.\n\nI suspect there will be many who feel this way who have sufficient money to be able to sponsor those who are working to prepare the way.\n\nPerhaps a three-way beneficial trade could be established that might create the means to alleviate precarity. In our example, Margaret could establish a relationship with a particular resilient community that consists of:\n\n1) Margaret and the community deciding they are a good fit culturally so she'd be accepted into the community.\n\n2) Margaret contributing a monthly fee to the community which will reserve her a spot in the community at any point in the future that she decides to join on a full-time basis.\n\n3) The community sponsoring people like Vinay and others who are doing work in resilience. Perhaps a group of communities even sponsor a hostel or apartment within the nearby cities to act as the group's base of operation for those they are sponsoring.\n\nIn return, Vinay and the others agree to act as ambassadors between the city and the community. Regularly traveling back and forth. Helping build the future living quarters of the sponsors, with the sponsors like Margaret coming out to help as much as they can.\n\nWhat do you think? Any other ways we can help the precariat so they can work on the more important work ahead?\n\n", "created_at": "2011-12-08 19:26:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:58.562291", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 552, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2909, "user_id": 1485, "topic_id": 2876, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi There\n\nTo kick off this discussion thread, we're keen to identify other libraries that might be interested in establishing library-hack-maker spaces...\n\nWe don't mean spaces where the three things are 'co-located' - instead, we mean: organisations who are interested in INTEGRATING the three types of activity, in short, so that hackers/makers can contribute content to read/write libraries.\n\nIf you know people we should be talking to about this, please do get in touch!\n\nThanks,\n\nAnnemarie", "created_at": "2014-04-29 11:37:55", "updated_at": "2017-10-02 13:48:33.737653", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 82, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30111, "user_id": 1629, "topic_id": 2715, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>Slow calm reply</b>\n\nHi guys, thought it best to wait a little before replying :)\n\nIt was great to talk to @Alberto on Saturday.

Our chat was in full view of everyone, and if any sin was committed it simply came from the positive energy generated. I'm truly sorry if any trouble or stress was genrated by this.\n\nI'd like to talk about the content brought up here and continue the conversation over on the much neglected <a href=\"/t/the-viral-academy/358/integrating-the-viral-academy-and-the-unmonastery-a\">Viral Academy group</a> which I'll be posting a lot more to in the coming days. Over the last 4 weeks I've been here in Matera I've been discussing with @Ben about the structural problems of this first prototype of the unMonastery concept. Change is not easy, especially with a concept held so dearly and with a group of people that have been living together day and night in the same space, yet these discussions were positive and open. @Ben is in a very difficult position, and we have all been doing everything we can to support him, and make this project a success. It is the structural problems though that have made this process of necessary change hard, and the pressure for results has been enourmous. The more the pressure the easier it is for people to snap and become defensive.\n\nThe first problem was that the original project was structured as a rotating group of 10 or so individual projects living in the same space. Ben agreed that <font color=\"#000000\">one project/one person <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmonastery-matera-global-strategy-summit-2\">wasn't a good idea</a> and brought it up in our last meeting</font>\u00a0(<span>Global Strategy Summit at the unMonastery 2),</span>\u00a0The second and related problem was that there was no explicit place for individual projects to come together and seek overlaps. The group comes from very different backgrounds, and group work differs in each speciality. Group theatre work differs from community co-living, which differs from community engagement which in turn differs from engineering or software project management. In the time I've been here we had one planning meeting, which rapidly dissolved into an understandable confusion of approaches. Planning therefore consisted of daily 15 minute reports back as to what each individual had done during the day.\n\nIn this framework the only way to seek collaboration was on a small tasks, based on approaching people one-on-one. There simply was no physical space to discuss any significant pooling of resources, time or ideas. Add to this two very significant other factors - pressure to deliver results, and hands off leadership, and I would argue that even the most open and collaboration minded group of individuals would struggle. The greater the pressure the more inclined individuals are to knuckle down and concentrate on their own outputs, and without someone whose job it is to look at the big picture and initiate meetings it is asking an awful lot of people to hope for a collaborative structure to emerge by itself in such a short time frame.\n\nEdgeRyders are doers. The culture is one of a do-ocracy. Each individual tends to be strong willed and motivated to speak through action - long meetings are an anathema. Talking to Ben before the Global Strategy Summit I pointed to the problem of changing culture, and the need to take at least a full day planning this. Even with a simple agile planning session to organise the next weeks work, it is strongly recommended to take a full day. A significant shift in strategy and group culture takes at least this. However, this would have been very difficult to talk the group into, even half a day out of individual schedules is met with understandable resistance. The 2 hours meeting we had failed even to report back, and we never got down to the task of looking closely at rationalisation of resources and project overlaps.\n\nIt is with this background that the current mini-flame war errupted. And it brings me to the other major structural problem that the unMonastery has. And this one is unavoidable. It is due to end at the end of May. Everyone is trying very hard to contribute to the possibility of the project continuing, but in the meantime it makes it super hard for all the projects here to gain traction. It was a discussion with @Marc about an <a href=\"/open-culture-festival\">Open Culure Festival</a> for Matera that the an idea came up that could address this issue.\n\nTogether with @Marc we black-hatted the ideas for the festival we had discussed (handing out open source software, creating a growing map of local resources, running a Creative Commons Film Festival etc). The problem @Marc identified was that he didn't want to do another event where people turn up, watch, participate, and then there is no follow-up. The solution we thought up together was to leave as a legacy, a <a href=\"/open-culture-festival\">local open-source server</a>, and then to run monthly online hackathons to add to or further develop open-data or open source tools for the community.\n\nThe follow up could then further be facilitated by offering prizes to members of the local community that contributed most to the development of this open cultural resource for the community - and my proposal was that members of the EdgeRyders community with an interest in open culture could offer a \"residency\" in their homes. I for one would offer for people from Matera to stay in my flat in London, and based on previous discussions on this theme I'm sure others would. Visually we could show these links from the OpenStreetMap of Matera to places on offer for a residency, and this would make a powerful visual symbol of both the growing local culture facilitated by the unMonastery project, and the cultural exchanges and international connections that EdgeRyders brings to the initiative.\n\nIs this practical? Which brings us to the question of resources (@elf-pavlik notwithstanding :) My proposal to @Alberto was with regard to using the EdgeRyders Viral Academy budget to support the online initiative, which would allow us to provide the follow-up to this event and the potential closing of the unMonastery to at least the end of the year, and possibly all the way to a festival in 2015. This is I believe a great synergy between the Viral Academy project and the unMonastery. Maybe we got carried away in our conversation, and although I feebly tried to cast doubt on the idea, there is no doubt that we possibly took it too far in our conversation in terms of actual physical occupancy and extension of the unMonastery project (something that I am not sure I could personally do, or that the budget would tolerate).\n\nHowever I believe in a soft-yes to early stage ideas - as I believe we all should. Running with an idea and exploring it's potential is something that both the unMonastery and EdgeRyders should excell at, and I fear that many people in this thread have been too negative too early.\n\nLife is hard enough in Matera figuring out how to deliver real results in a difficult situation without each other making things harder. People have been hurtful and people have been hurt. It's time for some healing, mutual support, trust and some hard thinking.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-16 19:03:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:45.808814", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1330, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3770, "user_id": 1879, "topic_id": 3737, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<a href=\"/t/lote4-the-stewardship/359\">LOTE4</a>\u00a0is all about tapping into citizen-resources and reorganizing services to tap into peer-to-peer networks and assets.\u00a0 Not surprisingly, when we feel lonely or isolated, are in immediate danger of flooding or some other disaster, or living with a long term medical condition it is help from friends, family and neighbors that\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/people_helping_people_the_future_of_public_services_wv.pdf\">we find the most helpful</a>\u00a0(this is why I think @Ben\u2019s and Remy\u2019s session on\u00a0<a href=\"/t/sessions-at-lote4-the-stewardship/590/the-future-of-care-in-the-hands-of\">Future of Care in the Hands of Hackers</a>? is the place to be at LOTE4)\n\nNow imagine being able to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.unglobalpulse.org/urban-resilience-petajakarta\">mesh together all sorts of digital data</a>- private sector \u2018big data\u2019 (telecom providers on how people user mobile phone); city\u2019s data on urban planning, energy and water supply; citizen-generated crowdsourced data and tweets; digital platforms and networks that help organize and coordinate stuff like Uber and AirBnB.\u00a0 In a way, it\u2019s tapping into the growing infrastructure of a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2014/09/24/disruption-from-the-collaborative-economy/\">sharing economy</a>\u00a0to help citizens reduce risks before a disaster strikes and bounce back faster from its effects (one of the better\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/helen-goulden/sharing-in-a-changing-cli_b_5273527.html\">write-ups</a>\u00a0I\u2019ve come across is by Helen Goulden of Nesta, with h/t @gquggiotto, while Patrick Meier has been a source of <a href=\"http://irevolution.net/2013/06/11/uber-waze-airbnb-seeclickfix-for-disaster-response/\">constant inspiration</a>).\n\n<strong>As mentioned up top, we\u2019re already seeing some of this in action</strong>. \u00a0San Francisco and Portland are working with AirBnB to strengthen\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com.au/press/news/airbnb-san-francisco-and-portland-city-leaders-visit-white-house-announce-new-emergency-preparedness-partnership\">city-level emergency preparedness</a>, Rio de Janeiro \u00a0is trading data on construction projects, city events, road sensors and cameras on its highways for real-time data of popular travel and cycling apps- Waze, Moovit and Strava- \u00a0to do better\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/07/07/why-google-waze-helps-local-governments-track-its-users/\">traffic management and urban planning</a>. \u00a0In FYR Macedonia, an initiative is looking at whether the\u00a0<a href=\"http://europeandcis.undp.org/blog/2014/04/09/proxy-data-and-disaster-resilience/\">mobile phone data can be used as a proxy</a>\u00a0for real-time disaster management.\n\nSo, a few questions that may be interesting to go through (would love to get comments though- adding more, vetoing some of these?):\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Could we start\u00a0<strong>a list of interesting digital data \u2018stewards\u2019 whose services and actions can be tapped</strong>\u00a0into in emergencies? \u00a0</li>\n\n<li>My 4-year old says that each time a particular boy in her school gets sniffles, the entire class is sick the next day.\u00a0 So, if preschoolers can be an early warning sensor network for a flu epidemic, do we consider only<strong> digital data or the existing data that can be made available</strong>\u00a0in a form that it helps better, faster decision making?</li>\n\n<li>What <strong>nudges may get and keep these outfits playing ball</strong>?\u00a0 In San Francisco, some AirBnB hosts will be trained to be first responders in emergencies in their communities- who wouldn\u2019t want to stay at that person\u2019s place, right?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Can or should this type of a process be engineered in a first place</strong>?

It seems like now, we can get by with almost no budget. We can get a lot of stuff via-via, if all options go through. There\u2019s no point in doing eg. a crowdfunding for very low amounts. We don\u2019t have a real call to action yet, so we risk wasting opportunities.

The story misses some power for now and we need to clear stuff out.\n\nWhen we need serious budget, and have a concrete call to action, we should plan things carefully to time them right, tell the right story. Arne points out the importance of having a website, an email address and perhaps a legal structure when there is more money involved. This in order to look more legit and to not burden other organizations with the administrative aspect.\n\nAngela and Massimiliano think that talking about the history of insulin and diabetes, with fascinating stories, will work well for the educational aspect.\n\n<h3>Timeline &amp; actions</h3>\n\nWe drafted a rough timeline in ideal conditions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t12 May: received bacterial samples, start culturing</li>\n\n<li>\t31 May: successful culturing, start extraction of compounds &amp; plan analysis</li>\n\n<li>\t31 August: finished analysis runs &amp; made follow-up plans</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe\u2019ll try to minimize delays by leaning on the practical experience CCL already collected, to avoid failures in lab work.\n\nWinnie will find out protocols/shipping\n\n@arnepauwels will figure out if OBL will be available when the samples arrive and in the summer\n\n@Rita will collect the consumables when we know more about the protocols\n\n<strong>Next time we meet on April 26th, 8pm @ ReaGent!</strong>\n\n", "created_at": "2017-04-13 10:54:09", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 06:01:17.192979", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 569, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 25.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3580, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31741, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3895, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>Assembly up</b>\n\nHi @igel, apparently the guys worked on the application and there's an assembly wiki up (see the comments).\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/en/agora/wiki-setting-up-the-edgeryders-assembly-at-31c3\n\n<a href=\"/u/elf_pavlik\">@elf_Pavlik</a>\u00a0thank you for sharing the videos, you made my day &lt;3\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-29 09:18:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:54.464425", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 60, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31659], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22753, "user_id": 2568, "topic_id": 4571, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Curious</b>\n\nHi, sorry for not getting back earlier.

I am now one of 12 Directors of the Limited Company we set up to run various projects, and network the multitude of other organisations working locally on these and related issues.\u00a0\n\nIn some ways, I feel like I am building my personal resilience - I am a qualified cycle mechanic (Cytek Level 1, which is a basic qualification, since you ask, but enough to get me by on my bike and help others), I cycle for almost all the journeys I make (thus am much less affected than most, at least directly, when oil prices spike), I grow some of my own food on an Allotment (in England, small patches of land are rented to people for small sums of money by local authorities), and I have a good network of friends and acquaintances in my street and local town who I know will all pull together to help each other when the need arises. But, while I'm developing my academic and work skills by studying for a PhD (on the *resilience* of certain organisations), beginning to work as a Lecturer, and volunteering on all manner of projects, I am extremely uncertain about the future, and about how our community might cope in the long-term following significant shocks. Though I feel like I have a good understanding of what the term 'resilience' means in everyday speech, and in various academic fields, I am less certain what it looks like in practice - at least, I am unsure what a community or society truly resilient to the enormous shocks we face in the future would look like.\n\nIn particular, I am concerned about producing enough food locally (not reliant on long-distance transport), and about employment - and the effects increased transportation costs have on the ability of people to travel to work.\n\nPeople often cite my hometown - Stroud, Gloucestershire - as a frontrunner in the development of a resilient and sustainable local economy. But it still feels like we have a long way to go!\n\nYes, we have a very successful weekly Farmers' Market - with produce largely from within a 50 mile radius of the town, and a couple of Community Supported Agriculture projects, not to mention several full allotment sites (with long waiting lists), and a town council interested in creating more. But our local area also falls within the food footprint of bigger settlements nearby - such as Gloucester and Bristol. How are we going to feed all these people in a world where yields and transportation of food is dramatically affected by peak oil and climate change?\n\nYes, we have a 'Car Club' where people share 4 communal vehicles, so they do not have to own their own car but have access to one. And we have some good train connections - to the nearest large town and to London, and a few decent bus services. But most bus services are terrible - especially for the many isolated rural settlements that make up our district, and unattractive to people. Public transport is prohibitively expensive, and provision for cyclists is poor (not to mention the hills!). There has been a lot of work and campaigning on improving infrastructure for cycling, but little action by local authorities. In Transition Stroud, we are looking into electric bike provision, and working out how we can best mobilise and put pressure on local authorities - but transport is a national policy issue, with provision privatised to large companies. How can we influence them? Or can we take this provision back into public ownership?\n\nThere is an ongoing debate locally about housing - mainly the opposition to construction in the countryside dominates media coverage, but discussion of the high prices of housing, the increasing difficulty young people have in finding accomodation in the places they grew up, is never far behind. Is there a solution to this conundrum that can also address the need for new build housing to be as energy efficient and environmentally sound as possible? Following my research on UK Building Societies (mutuals - cooperatives owned by their consumers - which were once the dominant mortgage lenders in the UK, and before that helped people to pool funds to build homes), I am involved in the tentative beginnings of a 'Stroud REbuilding Society' - the aim being to use a cooperative model to enable young people to access affordable, green, housing.\n\nWith others in Transition Stroud, I have been debating the difference between creating new 'sustainable enterprises' and creating resilient economies where we can reduce our reliance on money and hence on wage-labour, making life easier for the unemployed and those on low incomes, and enabling volunteering. We have a local currency (which can only circulate in the local town, and loses value over time so cannot be hoarded), and a TimeBank (where each hour of work donated is equal to another hour requested), and a good culture of voluntary groups and small enterprises. But national and local government cuts, and increased competition for funding is making much of this work considerably more difficult. We need to figure out how to build a new economy as the old one falls apart fast!\n\nMaybe I am too pessimistic, and too focussed on the problems, and questions, than on the solutions. To counter this I will mention the events we have coming up:\n\nIn July we have organised four days of 'Edible Open Gardens', where 40 productive gardens, allotments and orchards will be open to the public, showcasing their growing methods and providing workshops from basic to advanced techniques (starting out and composting to wildlife gardening and soil micro-organisms). See here: <a href=\"http://www.transitionstroud.org/wpedibleopengardens/\" title=\"http://www.transitionstroud.org/wpedibleopengardens/\">http://www.transitionstroud.org/wpedibleopengardens/</a>. I'll bring some of the pamphlets we've made to advertise the weekend to the conference.\n\nIn September, we are running our 5th annual 'Open Eco-Renovated Homes' weekend, you can see videos and more from previous years here: http://www.stroudopenhomes.org.uk/. I'll bring some printed material from previous years of this event too, if I can find it!\n\nWe're also running a series of films - 'Debtocracy' and shorts on the Greek crisis and community responses, and 'Just Do It!', a film about UK climate activists.\n\nThere's lots more too, but I guess it will have to wait for the conference. If any of the above has interested you, please comment below and I can elaborate.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-07 10:22:10", "updated_at": "2017-09-01 07:25:55.845023", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1137, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 25.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18668, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1766, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Tell me where to send the music and logos...</b>\n\nI used mobygratis.com as a source for the music.

They began having a discussion as to why they haven\u2019t been leaving their home so often. The two girls deeply expressed their concerns and experiences with regards to sexual harassment on the street and how the fear resulted in them staying home. The conversation attracted a lot of surrounding men in the ahwa, whom then decided to surround them and listen in on the conversation. The female\u2019s stories were well received from others listening in.\n\nTherefore, the two females spread the word among other women in the neighborhood about how they received positive reactions and how their stories and exchange of experiences has impacted the men. Hence, more and more women went to down to the streets and expressed their concerns to other men in the area.\n\nIn addition, men assisted in raising awareness about sexual harassment by exchanging stories with other men throughout the Downtown area. As time passed, communication and the exchange of stories became prominent and it was noticeable that more women were moving freely in the streets.\n\nThis dramatic change was the result of the two girls realizing that action and communication was much more effective than staying indoors and living in fear.\n\nIn 2015, the situation in Downtown Cairo changed drastically and it is anticipated by Egyptians that by the end of 2017 Egypt as a whole will be free of sexual harassment, so as long as everyone contributes in raising awareness.\n\n_This Future Now article is one of the results of an ongoing discussion about things we don't like about our culture in Egypt and are changing.

This online platform is based on a crowdsourcing approach to social innovation. We would like to apply for the EU Social Innovation competition. We would have two questions:\n\n- is it a problem that the platform exists already, and it is not just in the idea phase? We launched a simple version, but we are developing it every day to introduce new features.\n\n- our mission is to help social entrepreneurs realise their ideas, and therefore create jobs. From this point of view we would satisfy the judging criteria.

It does seem that the existence of two approaches is now established. We knew this from before\u00a0\"Taking care\", but I at least found it useful (if difficult) to go through the full experience of offline.\n\nThat said, I would like to suggest a different approach from the one you propose. You questions are obviously relevant, but I think we are not in a position to address them yet: we lack the necessary evidence. We have anecdotes (\"people find writing\u00a0difficult\", \"hackers are good collaborators\", \"good collaboration minimizes verbosity\"), but no real research on the matter. So, I propose to move from normative to positive research questions. You ask \"<strong>how <em>can</em> we obtain something which is desirable, for example open care services?</strong>\" I would like to ask \"<strong>how do desirable results <em>actually</em> obtain?</strong>\".\u00a0\n\nThere is little doubt that better, cheaper, faster coordination is conducive to better outcomes in all collaborative efforts, including open care (following your notation: open care is the care that happens out there and is open). <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/free-innovation\">von Hippel</a>, for example, makes a strong case that what he calls \"free innovators\"\u00a0<em>systematically</em>\u00a0underinvest in diffusion efforts (documentation). He is supported by empirical research in six countries. So, I would start by building a micro model of how collaboration (building and making accessible documentation)\u00a0<em>actually happens.\u00a0</em>I would keep very close track of online-offline.\u00a0\n\nExample: one of the examples given by von Hippel is NightScout. In the story as he tells it, the collaboration happens entirely online, and is triggered by, of all platoforms, Twitter:\n\nOn May 14 last year, he [Costik] tweeted a picture of his solution: a way to upload the Dexcom receiver\u2019s data to the Internet using his software, a $4 cable and an Android phone. That tweet caught the eye of other engineers across the country. One was Lane Desborough, an engineer with a background in control systems for oil refineries and chemical plants whose son, 15, has diabetes. Mr. Desborough had designed a home-display system for glucose-monitor data and called it NightScout. But his system couldn\u2019t connect to the Internet, so it was merged with Mr. Costik\u2019s software to create the system used today.\n\nI am sure that's not the whole story. So, here's the paper I'd like you to write, possibly involving some students:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Some in depth case studies of collaboration taken from open care initiatives. The case studies would go micro on collaboration: ok, so Desborough saw Costik's tweet. Then what? Did they meet? When? To do what? Did Costik redirect Desborough onto GitHub, or BitBucket? Did he email his own notes? What happened as the project scaled? Etcetera. There is an obvious partner for this: Patient Innovation.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Some field work on the same thing based on what OpenCare (the project)\u00a0is doing. How do people collaborate in the WeMake lab and with the broader world (technical forums etc.)? How is free-form conversation conducive to people working more together? How is working more together conducive to creating better results? We have at least four cases of people \"doing things together\" that seem to have met through OpenCare, but researchers could also track some of the hundreds of initiatives that have been reported.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nSo. You (Ezio) could build a small team\u00a0and direct them. This would result in a paper called something like \"Online and offline environments for\u00a0collaboration in free innovation: the case of care services\", or similar.\u00a0\n\nFinancially speaking, this thing could be funded by what we used to call the big Fellowships. Now they would entail being appointed by ScImpulse, but that's just a bureaucratic detail. @markomanka promised to send me a draft of a possible call for expressions of interest, which we could direct according to what we decide to do here. The stroke of genius would be to embed some participant observation: get a member of the NightScout community to take responsibility for the NightScout case study, etc. This would \"embed\" OpenCare in those projects.\u00a0\n\nMakes sense?\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-15 12:30:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:01.556573", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 758, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19944], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 9026, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2757, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Well done! </b>\n\nExcellent news, keep up the good work!

The next meeting will focus the discussion on developing clear proposal for what unmonastery will/can be in Matera. It will not be about what unMon can do <u>for </u>Matera but what Matera and unMon can do <u>together</u>.\u00a0 It will focus on:\n\nhow to improve upon what happened in first 6 months\n\nwhat is important/foundational\n\nhow things can continue to evolve\n\nI think this is now clear to people that were in the room that initiative needs to come from Matera at this stage-- as most unMonks will be gone anyway. There seems to be general excitement at this shift in thinking and approach. I think the notes don't clearly express the conclusions reached, which are not about the problems but about the next steps. The plans for next meeting are based on the goals and understanding of a need for a true collaboration and engagement with people/organizations in Matera in developing the next phase of unMon in Matera, if it is to happen at all.\n\nSo what (we hope) will happen at next meeting:\n\nBreak out into 3 groups to discuss how Matera would develop unmon concept in Matera\n\n1. Process- Steps: Time/ real Engagement: Involve other people, not only same people, neighborhoods\n\n2. New way to collaborate, be collective, co-living\n\n3. Clear common objective: One topic - which can be unifying force for to bring many perspectives/ angles on the same point-- science, philosophy, art, hackers, performance, social innovations.\n\nIn casual discussions the next day we also recognized that it is important to think about the next phase as an exchange:\n\nWhat can Matera bring to unMonastery: history, spirituality, platform for to share unMon as example to international community as new/old way of living through Matera2019, way of being, spontaneous, slow, highlight work of local organizations and initiatives\n\nWhat can unMonastery bring to Matera, connection to international community, experiments in co-living as new forms of economy and sustainability. Something that can be replicated- European dimension. Expertise and resources in new technology and social innovation practices.\n\nThe hope is that it is now clear to people here in Matera of the need to step up to show initiative in beginning to be active stewards, along side the current unMonks, and it is not enough to just talk (which is a major step and will probably have to be re-emphasized often). I hope that there will be some collective action, emerging leadership and initiative demonstrated. Moving Materani from talking about unMon in Matera to drafting a solid proposal for unMon and Matera together would be step in right direction.\n\n@RitaO has stepped up to start a local google group to send out notes and to organize a meeting next week in order to not loose momentum. Most likely at Unibas, a space Luca Tamborino has offered and might bring in a new crowd, and is part of a strategic move to separate unMonastery from the building.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-31 19:14:38", "updated_at": "2018-05-28 16:38:00.975774", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 617, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1438], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26041, "user_id": 3606, "topic_id": 708, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Impressive story and idea !!!</b>\n\nWell as very first I would like to graduate @ChristineSa\u00a0you for your movement and idea at first of all.

I have always done my best to grasp knowledge and to learn from past experience in order to become a better person for myself and the community I live in.\n\nWhen I was 11, my parents went to Italy to seek a better life for my family and I had to follow them. Having had to go through all the changes - leaving my country, my friends, my home, my habits behind - and through my experience in Italy helped me become more open to the new and more self confident. I stayed there for 9 years and all this time I tried to make the most out of my studies and of the interpersonal relationships. I graduated from a foreign languages high school that gave me the opportunity to cultivate my passion for new cultures and international exchanges. Actually, I was part of two such exchanges, one in France and the other in Sweden. These experiences made me become aware of the cultural differences between the peoples and the particularities of each of them.\n\nFinishing high school, I realized I wanted to come back to Romania and do my Bachelor studies there. The International Business and Economics faculty seemed the right choice as it offered me the chance to look more deeply into the issues of international economy and to better understand how the world around me works. Admission to this faculty proved to be a hard task as I had to pass exams at subjects that were unfamiliar for me because I had been studying in Italy. However, I am used to having to work hard for I want. Things have never been easy, but determination and dedication are the \u2018fuels\u2019 in the <em>ryde</em> to success.\n\nDuring faculty, I doubled my studies with extracurricular activities. So far I have taken an internship at Volksbank Bank, getting to know the basics of banking and another one at \u00a0PricewaterhouseCoopers, where I help with the international marketing and with organizing external events. In the second year of my studies, I decided I wanted to be more involved in activities with people of my age, so I joined a student NGO, <em>Volunteers for ideas and projects</em>, which I had heard was one of the most elitist and active organizations of its kind. The first year was a full of enriching experiences and numerous occasions for me to use and develop my social and organizational skills. I took part in organizing various conferences, planned different events for fellow students and made the acquaintance of inspiring people. Stepping out of my comfort zone was not piece of cake for me, as I used to be quite shy and felt uneasy talking in front of people I didn\u2019t know, but my courage and desire to improve have paid off. I am now the vice president of the Business Club of the association and this has given me more self assurance and more clarity as towards what my objectives should be in the future. Looking back on my membership in this NGO I am thankful I have had the chance to be part of this adventure which, for me, has meant the road to becoming a more mature and \u00a0responsible person.\n\n\u00a0As far as my academic studies are concerned, I don\u2019t want my journey to stop here. I am determined to continue it with a master program abroad. After considerable research and hard thinking, I have come to choose France, for its various educational offers and for the fact that I love French. L\u2019Institut des Hautes Etudes Europ\u00e9ennes in Strasbourg sits on top of my list. I dream of a diplomatic carrier for me and I am sure that this master will be of great help in achieving my professional objectives.\n\nI would very much like to participate at this conference in Strasbourg that you are organizing, because I want to know more about creating the path to a fulfilled carrier and to interact with people of my age, driven by the same dreams and motivations. It would also be a good opportunity for me to practice my French and to explore the sights of Strasbourg, hopefully, my future host city in the years to come.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAmalia\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-06 16:44:54", "updated_at": "2017-09-09 07:42:51.300020", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 784, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 30.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12146, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 2527, "post_number": 3, "raw": "and of course I can use all the social media experience from (co)leading a social media team while making \\#Lote3 and making the social media Lote3 and unMon buzz :-)\n\n( and I know the platform well so I can keep facilitatinng creating new content by the new edgeryders and making the edgeryders platform tours :-)\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-19 00:13:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:09.420888", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 59, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 6.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10593], "is_liked_by": [8, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19271, "user_id": 1003, "topic_id": 5655, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>really? </b>\n\n\"although we know the two projects\u00a0are distinct, the border between them is fuzzy (which can be seen as being quite natural and a good thing).\"\n\n@melancon @Alberto @Rossana_Torri @markomanka @Lakomaa\n\n\u00a0We really need to talk about this (and I'm not reffering about graphics or futile things) during the Steering comitee.\n\nDealing with this mess it's\u00a0counterproductive IMHO.\u00a0\n\nMore during the Cons Meeting days\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-16 18:39:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.428240", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 94, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15322], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2416, "user_id": 1680, "topic_id": 2383, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Sooo, we talked about Portugal.

I always want to double things. So if you say you want 200 people, I say 'let's shoot for 400!' (not at!). Is 400 too many? I'm confident we can hit this number. And not just any old people, excellent people. (but unexcellent people won't be excluded, of course (Or will they?)). And given 200+ people, I think plenty of space for camping would be a big plus. It could work if people are hosted in many different places, couchsurfer style, and attending meetings in one central location. But I'm thinking it would be cool for everyone to be sleeping in the same place, and have the meetings in giant tents or something. Then there is no issue with people needing to leave cos they have to catch public transport back to their hosts, or whatever. The meetings can go on all night! Thoughts?\n\n((And then a wild idea comes to mind: What if we contrive some way to own the land, then we never have to leave the unDojo. It's not a priority to go this far, just... what if? Is anyone inspired by the thought? You know what? I might buy the land for the tent village, but not tell anyone. Then after a cool first week, 70% of the people will say 'hey, i wish we could stay for a few more days (cos our subgroup still hasn't finished this cool project we're working on)\" and I'll be like \"You can. No problem. I know the guy that owns this land and he's pretty chill\". Then soon enough people will forget about asking if they have to leave, and they'll lose track of time, and magical things will be produced unMon sty-lee (pigs). . . . . . . . . . . Do I live in an insane castle in the sky? Yes, but it's real! History will be the judge. If you grok with this idea, dare to dream with me. If you don't grok, no worries, [Dorotea] will give you a cool LOTE no matter what. (and I will still help her)))\n\n", "created_at": "2014-01-28 22:57:53", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:12.982671", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 474, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24485, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1503, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>Les 'mous' et le 'souci exclusif de soi'</b>\n\nHello <b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.37776332069188356\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; \"><span>Nirgal. </span></b>Monastic life is also something which I have always been somehow temped to try. <span><span>There are times</span> <span>in my life that</span> <span>I</span> <span>would have liked to</span> <span>drop everything and</span> <span>go</span> <span>on a high mountain</span><span>,</span> <span>and stay there,</span> <span>recluse</span><span>.</span></span><span><span> But I</span> <span>am un</span><span>able to</span> <span>sit</span> <span>cross-legged</span><span>,</span> <span>since I was</span> <span>8 years old</span><span>,</span> <span>because I have</span> <span>too much energy in my body</span><span>.</span></span> <span><span>It's a bit</span> <span>ridiculous</span><span>,</span> <span>but</span> <span>that's what</span> has <span>made me</span> <span>think that</span> <span>monastic life was not</span> <span>for me!</span></span> <span><span>That</span> <span>was when</span> <span>I was 8</span><span>.</span></span> My understanding of the world has grown since then, and now I realize that the greater the degree of goodness (illumination), the more sensitive the mind becomes to the sorrows of fellow beings and more resolutely does it act to alleviate their condition.

A problem Yauheni tries to battle is the limitations that social projects encounter that stops them from growing. He believes that by working together many social problems can be tackled. That is why Yauheni founded 1,5 years ago an organization called \u2018Talaka.by platform\u2019 that has now over 3000 people connected to it. \u2018Talaka\u2019 is an ancient Belarusian word that stands for \u2018working in cooperation\u2019 and it may not surprise you that mission of Talaka.by is to create a platform for solving common problems by shared efforts.\n\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/2/22bbb23accb7dbf0de1dd93e582a3d10e13dd453.jpg)\n\nYauheni came up with this idea when he was in England and has seen many initiatives and social projects from close. He couldn\u2019t wait to come back home and develop Talaka. When I asked about what inspired him the most he answered me that it was his highschool a Lyceum in Minsk that basically gave him this ambitions and the will to act. This school has very good teachers that are considered as one of the best in the country and Yuaheni has developed himself a lot as a solution thinker during his time in this Lyceum.\n\nSo what is [Talaka.by](http://talaka.by) platform? What elements does it consist of? Many, I can tell you! I will list several:\n\n1. Talaka.by is a [b]crowd-sourcing platform[/b] for social initiatives. Social projects can register on Talaka.by and find support and connections for there project. Yauheni told me proudly that for example a year ago Mivia (Ludmila Skradal\u2019s project) started on Talaka.by platform!\n\n2. Talaka.School is an educational part of the platform: for social entrepreneurs and it also contains a series of offline educational events. Through this school initiatives get the basic tools on how to start a social business. Learning about business models etc. Many social initiatives went through these free and open courses.\n\n3. Talaka.Afisha is an online calendar for promoting social events.\n\n4. Talaka.Meetup is a series of meet-ups platform where the focus is on knowledge sharing and discussions on variety of topics.\n\n5. Talaka.Party is an entertainment format of leisure for the community where people can get to know each other offline, and thus are able to create stronger connections.\n\n6. Talaka.Mag is an online journal about social entrepreneurs, social activists and social projects. This Journal is coming soon.\n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/0/04fa576205998d0fe9c1531ac15de0d8a5ee73f9.jpg) \n\n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7a67f1447f90c522459461fd112284719dfdec4b.jpg)\n \n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9e7ee24cee9b8a55ea05fe8c0d63574267ff7da3.jpg)\n \n![img](/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e7a2b784521fda8a87bac4bb6323d5629d03a53c.jpg)\n\nBehind Yauheni stands a team of very motivated 6 young people that share the same mission as he does. Of course they also have a pool of volunteers helping Talaka.by achieve its goals.\n\nYauheni understood that while Crowdsourcing is very useful and powerful cooperation and connection tool, also financing is required when you want to support social initiatives in a sustainable way. Therefore Yauheni\u2019s team is currently working on adding a Crowdfunding module on Talaka.by platform so they can effectively support social initiatives not only by providing crowdsourcing but funding as well!\n\n----------\n## :ru: _Russian version_ <a name=\"ru\"></a>\n\n\u0417\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043a\u0430\u043a

I think it serves as an example for how creative industries can be used to \\#unfail other sectors, and maybe hererin lies a selling point for how we can \\#unfail the funding system for the creative sector itself. Either way, you must read this:\n\nBrussels is in lockdown, with cinemas, shops, pubs, theatres and sports clubs closed. With an ample supply of food and - much more importantly, beer - I have had little choice but to stay indoors, but I do have reason to be grateful to the slightly over-cautious Belgian authorities, for I have used this time to come up with an idea for the Belgianist action movie ever. The title, obviously, is \"Niveau d'alerte 4 / Veiligheidsniveau 4\", and it goes something like this:\n\nAfter many years living abroad, a Bruxellois (played by Jean-Claude Van Damme) returnes to his native Molenbeek to open a Friterie-Snack-Petite Restauration with his Dutch-speaking Muslim friend Mohammad. (If anybody knows a Flemish actor of North African origin, let me know. Mohammad will deliver all his lines in Dutch, JC in French, but they'll obviously understand each other \u2013 after all, we need to secure funding from the Flemish arts council). JC is horrified, however, to find that the neighbourhood is being terrorised by a band of jihadis, led by a heavily-bearded Benoit Poelvoorde. They intimidate local merchants who sell alcohol, harrass women not wearing the hijab, etc. JC goes to the interior ministry to complain, but the racist, grumpy, N-VA interior minister (played by Hubert Damen) dismisses his concerns, saying that he doesn't care what all those Muslims get up to in Molenbeek. Returning to his Friterie, JC finds it ablaze \u2013 it has been firebombed by Poelvoorde's jihadis for daring to sell Jupiler. JC drags Mohammad from the blaze, but it's too late \u2013 he dies in his arms. (Cue JCVD screaming \"Noooooooooooooooooon!!!!!!!!!!!!\")\n\nNow it's time for JCVD to get even. He tracks down a jihadi and dangles him by his feet from Pont Leopold II. Terrified that he might fall into the toxic waters of the canal, he spills the beans \u2013 Poelvoorde's jihadis are about to carry out an attack on the Atomium. JCVD must get there in time to stop the attack, so after letting the jihadi fall into the canal he hails a cab and tells the driver to take him to Heizel. \"Not far enough,\" replies the taxi driver nonchalantly. \"I'm only taking people to the airport.\" He drives off. The second taxi driver sighs and says that he's coming off his shift and only taking people to Anderlecht. The third agrees to take JCVD to the Atomium, but spends 7 minutes filling in a form, turning on the meter and typing the address into his GPS before putting his car into gear. He drives slowly, and whines constantly about the short distance. JCVD doesn't leave him a tip, which he also whines about.\n\nHe's arrived just in time, as he sees the jihadis entering the Atomium and beating up the receptionists who demand they pay 12.50 euros per person. JCVD follows them up the winding staircase and engages them in hand-to-hand combat. Some escape out a window and begin climbing one of the tubes connecting the spheres. JCVD follows, and after more hand-to-hand combat, all but one of the jihadis have been dealt with, with the survivor fleeing into mini-Europe with JCVD hot on his heels. The fleeing jihadi is cornered in the France section, and after more martial arts combat he meets his demise after being impaled on the model of the Eifel tower. With his dying breath, however, he lets slip that the Atomium was but a diversion \u2013 the real operation is taking place elsewhere...\n\nAt the Palais Royale, Eddy Merckx is receiving a medal for services to the Belgian nation when the ceremony is interrupted by gunfire. Benoit Poelvoorde and his jihadi squad burst through the door and surround Eddy, King Philippe and Queen Mathilde (all played, obviously enough, by themselves). Suddenly, there is the sound of breaking glass, and JCVD rappels down from the ceiling, kicking several jihadis in the face. Despite the toll taken by his advancing years and (alleged) abuse of anabolic steroids, Eddy joins in the fight, and soon most of the assilants are dealt with. In the confusion, however, Poelvoorde has managed to make his escape with Queen Mathilde as his hostage, hijacking a passing STIB tram. Eddy whistles to attract JCVD's attention and tosses him the bicycle with which he won the 1974 Tour de France. JCVD sets off in hot pursuit of the speeding tram.\n\nThe tram is travelling too fast to take an upcoming bend, and derails spectacularly, slamming into the steps at the Palais de Justice and bursting into flames. Poelvoorde climbs out, dragging Mathilde with him, before the tram explodes. Arriving at the Palais de Justice, JCVD spots Poelvoorde, prodding Mathilde in the back with his AK-47, climbing the historic scaffolding that has adorned the facade since 2003. He follows hot on his heels, until he has Poelvoorde cornered, but he realises that he doesn't have a gun. Poelvoorde smirks, and raises his AK, but is caught off guard by a well-aimed kick delivered to his nether-regions by Queen Mathilde. He drops his Kalashnikov, and it clatters to the ground many hundreds of metres below. With a shrug of his shoulders, he decides to give up. He's had enough of jihad, he says. What's the point? Too much hassle, anyhow. And lately he's been craving nice, cool glasses of Grimbergen. \"Idiot!\" JCVD turns around. It's Hubert Damen, the N-VA interior minister. \"Why didn't you do what I told you? You've ruined my plans!\" JCVD and Mathilde look confused, so Damen explains in a slightly over-lengthy monologue. It is he, in fact, who has been pulling the strings behind the jihadis, using the death of Queen Mathilde as an excuse to implement repressive, racist policies. He shoots Poelvoorde, and just as he he is about to train his gun on Mathilde, there is a deafening noise \u2013 an army helicopter, with King Philippe inside, armed with a sniper rifle. Damen is riddled with gunfire, and, screaming, falls to his death on Place Poelaert.\n\nHaving rid Belgium of both the jihadis and the N-VA, JCVD becomes a national hero, and a grateful multi-cultural city erects a statue in his honour, and the film ends with JCVD, Philippe and Eddy Merckx downing glasses of Chimay on a sunny terrace in Molenbeek.\n\nFin\n\n<div class=\"text_exposed_show\" style=\"display: inline; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16.08px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n<span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"/u/thomas_goorden\" style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 19.2px; line-height: 32.64px;\">@Thomas_Goorden</a><span>\u00a0&amp; others can we turn this thing into a theatre play during LOTE?</span>\n\n</div>", "created_at": "2015-11-26 12:33:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:29.066977", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1295, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 10.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31640, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 6273, "post_number": 46, "raw": "<b>upvoting = likes</b>\n\nprimitive upvoting\n\n", "created_at": "2017-06-12 21:11:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:53.954175", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12338, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4987, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Come on</b>\n\nI know about Molenbeek.\u00a0<img alt=\"smiley\" height=\"23\" src=\"/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png\" title=\"smiley\" width=\"23\">\u00a0What I mean is: your parents where able to reach out to Syrians in town.

It started 10 years ago with a project called Otryv.by. This is a platform where young people can post events that they organize in their cities and where Aliaksei promotes his social business: city challenges (or city quests) for young people to discover their city, learn about its history, its artifacts, its buildings, streets etc. Most people pass the streets of Minsk (or any other city for that matter) without even knowing anything about it, walk in buildings without having any idea about its history or the reason for the building. This is not the main problem Aliaksei wants to solve however, according to him the main challenge lays in the very fact that there is no curiosity from the youth for the city. Young people feel like strangers in their own cities, so the quests help them to meet and encounter their city. It would be great if young people started to become more interested in why a metro or a street is called like it is called or what is going on in their neighborhoods, Aliaksei\u2019s words.\n\nBesides encouraging curiosity among young people, Aliaksei also wants to inspire young people through his platform, only then you can achieve a great impact, he believes. Sharing information about what is going on in Minsk and other cities is very important. What kind of events can people visit that will inspire them to also think about setting up a new project or event. \u201cIf you're alone, it is hard to improve something around you - in your area, city, country. But once you've inspired people, you're no longer alone and together you can change much more things around\u201d Aliaksei nicely put.\n\nAliaksei understands the power of inspiration as he got himself inspired by similar initiatives to Otryv.by in the neighboring countries like Russia & Ukraine.  He saw a movement of people that not only promoted the discovery of the place they live in but also providing the chance to discover each other\u2019s cities. Belarus did not have such an initiative and community so Aliaksei developed one.\n\nOtryv.by has organized over 75 Challenges in 25 cities having 6000 participants  (who participated in the quest at least once) and can officially be labeled a social enterprise. It was for me such a delight to talk to Aliaksei because of the way he thinks about social enterprises. His attitude: \u201cOf course you should ask money for the work and effort you put in\u201d instead of the often heard question: \u2018how can a social project ask for money\u2019? Aliaksei is a good example of a social entrepreneur in Belarus as he understands that because he is making money he is able to sustain Otryv.by and more importantly develop it further. I invite everyone to have a look on Otryv's website and to learn more about so many nice and hidden places that Otryv reveals: [http://www.otryv.by/?index=news&id=2013-games-interesting-places-belarus-part1](http://www.otryv.by/?index=news&id=2013-games-interesting-places-belarus-part1)\n\n  \n\nBy now Aliaksei\u2019s social enterprise is growing and more organizations are knocking on Otryv.by doors with requests to hold a quest for and in their buildings. During the national library day 2 weeks ago Otryv.by organized a quest in the National Library of Minsk. This resulted in an active event where over 400 young people discovered the library and learned about it by accomplishing different challenges.\n\nI am looking forward to further discovering Minsk (and other cities in Belarus) through Otryv\u2019s City quests! I also thought about Ludmila Skradal and how she could work together with Aliaksei to develop challenges that are also accessible for people with disabilities. In this way also people in wheelchairs could join and you will have city challenges for all. \n\nYou can now contact Aliaksei on edgeryders platform:

Only 5 percent are activating in a political party or organization. By comparison, three times more are involved with an organization promoting human rights or local/global community development.\n\nWhat is alarming for scholars and democracy advocates is that participation is no longer a natural result of stepping into adulthood, of taking up responsibilities, paying taxes etc, as it used to be. This means that if youth are indeed politically inactive today, they will most probably continue to be so when they get older [Plutzer 2002; Fieldhouse et al. 2007]. The question is: to what extent they are disengaged? Or rather they are engaged differently?\n\nWhat we see nowadays points to the latter, and by no means do youth appear apathetic. In their search for freedom and dignity, young Arabs took democracy in the streets, overcame oppression and became an inspiration for the rest of the world. <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/fotostrecke-71537.html\">Europeans</a> as well have voiced their frustration and disappointment with the current political system, lack of <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaign/making-living\">work prospects</a> and economic security. The newest social movements, Los Indignados or the global Occupy protests display innovative forms of (extra-parliamentary) participatory behavior \u2013 blockades and occupations \u2013 and a diverse<a href=\"http://socialcapital.wordpress.com/2011/10/21/is-occupy-wall-street-a-new-social-movement/\"> repertoire</a> which comprises rallies, demonstrations, camping, petition signing, pamphleteering or music. If these are not all new in the history of collective action, a sure novelty is brought by how technology is employed.\n\nChannels of participation have extended towards the online environment, and with that the fluidity of information has increased, as well as mobilization speed and the power of networks. Today we speak of net activism, \u201cgoing viral\u201d, <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/some-weekend-work-that-will-hopefully.html\">speak-to-tweet</a> service and other such tools to mobilize young people and help create change, albeit democratically. One idea behind \u201cTwitter revolutions\u201d and \u201cFacebook revolutions\u201d is that it\u2019s possible to join a protest instantaneously, irrespective of physical location. Individuals of all ages are now able to participate both as consumers and creators of political messages, and enact change through a complex interplay between <a href=\"http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/10/05/social-media-and-our-atmosphere-of-augmented-dissent/\">physicality and digitality</a>.\n\nIt is unclear, however, the extent to which these radical movements, often spontaneous, decentralized or lacking coherent demands can result in stable political change. In the words of D. Rushkoff, the real occupation takes place in terms of <a href=\"http://www.rushkoff.com/blog/2011/11/16/zuccotti-451.html\">value change</a>. Participation becomes global in nature and is organized around the \u201cwe\u201d: common goals, connectedness, shared spokesmanship and brotherhood.\n\nDigitalization also changes what to expect from and how to communicate with institutions. The idea behind new governance systems is that they are or will be internet-enabled. When it comes to traditional participation, Switzerland and Estonia have successfully implemented internet voting systems for years now and unsurprisingly, one in three e-voters is under 35 [<a href=\"http://www.vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/statistics/\">Estonian National Electoral Committee</a>]. Principles such as open collaboration and information transparency are at the core of new ideas to bridge citizens and institutions with online help: <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_the_year_open_data_went_worldwide.html\">open data</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rushkoff.com/open-source-democracy/\">open source government</a> movements promote interaction and participation of lots of people rather than central planning. In the former case, The UK, Italy and France already have set up infrastructures, while the European Commission is heading the same direction through its <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/1524&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en\">Open Data Strategy for Europe</a>.\n\nWith greater space for movement comes greater freedom, but this freedom is volatile. Online environments as data storage spaces could not only make it possible for citizens to hold governments accountable, but reversely, they could be used by other entities as well to monitor citizens\u2019 activity. According to <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/2011/11/what-i-learned-at-net4change-part-i/\">observers</a>, an increased web surveillance may alter democracy as we know it today; policies to reduce internet freedom or enable action against websites on the basis of their content (such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act\">SOPA</a>) have generated dissent, as are perceived by some to infringe on democratic principles (see the <a href=\"http://chokepointproject.net/the-project/\">Chokepoint</a> Project as example). This is but another facet of how politics become radicalized nowadays and how democracy is reinvented.\n\nFinally, while breaking with current political systems, mechanisms of participation and policy-making dynamics are changing, and so are the social roles. Echoing what Almond and Powell were saying decades ago, to look into how youth become politically socialized means to shed light on the deep transformations in nations\u2019 (today global) political culture [1978: 76]. What motivates young people to participate today? How do we make use of new engagement models and what do we expect to derive out of them? \n\n<strong><em>Help the Council of Europe and the European Commission to think about the issue in new ways and come up with innovative policies.

This was a big topic so we felt we had to establish some clear understanding first, but we found this led to rich discussion which squeezed our time for preparing our presentation.</span>\n\nHere are two documents from our session, both on Google docs.\u00a0\n\nThis is the notes reporting the session\u00a0\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/cly476r\" style=\"color: rgb(42, 172, 226); \">http://tinyurl.com/cly476r</a>\u00a0</strong>\n\nHere is a summary of links and ideas we gathered before the session\n\n<b style=\"font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; \"><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/bmb68mu\" style=\"color: rgb(42, 172, 226); \">http://tinyurl.com/bmb68mu</a></b>\n\nThese are open to edit by anyone who has the links but we ask for respect in doing so. We will add more edits and invite you to. This open editing is a good example of the key issue at the heart of the Commons: the need for us to open up Commons to everyone while also establishing boundaries, education and rules to protect and replenish.\u00a0\n\nOur overall challenge was: How to shift to a culture of Commons to enable young people to have a thriving future. In sharing their experiences and ideas, participants ranged across all the other conference strands such as learning and resilience, with a lot of thinking about alternative currencies, occupation of public space, free open data and so on. So, we agreed that Commons is fundamental to all the issues of thriving and access to resources.\u00a0\n\nWe broke our challenge down into four themes, some of which were more macro or theoretical, some more about process to achieve the shift: \u00a0\n\nA big challenge - how to protect the commons in the face of a global shift (i.e. at Rio) to place economic value on nature.\u00a0Solutions Include implementing the Ecocide law, implementing a Global Council of Planetary Rights to Protect the Commons, and the widespread generation of tools to reclaim the economic framework in ways that don't devalue nature.\n\nA challenge important to Council of Europe -\u00a0How to manage the commons when we live in an unequal society?\u00a0Solution - separate our private inalienable rights from public equality so no economic barriers to accessing commons as a principle (more private resources cant buy access to commons)\n\nA process challenge - How to reuse empty spaces for the common good? One solution is to charge\u00a0different levels of taxation, either plus or minus according to their private or shared use, at the city level.\n\nA process challenge - How to create the Commons.\u00a0Solution: This group delineated a method of using software for network aggregation in establishing communities of interest in the varios aspects of the Commons. These communities can designate reputable and authoritative figures to interact with policymakers relaying common community concerns. In this process they can define transnationally applicable legalities that apply to both the natural and the built environment.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-24 23:12:58", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 10:53:17.972416", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 680, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11667, "user_id": 2006, "topic_id": 2658, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hello Dorotea,\n\nOpen rate rarely causes issues with the spam.\n\nIf URLs are from the same domain they usually aren't considered as spam, plus content rate, more reasonable text and image only when needed.\n\n<span>I don't have information about email send out statists.

But this particular anthill is under attack. Something is disrupting it \u2013 maybe a predator, or a stream fed by a recent rain. It has taken damage, but\u00a0is far from dead.\n\nIn the center, close to the queen's chambers, activity goes on as normal. You might not notice the threat at all.\u00a0Out in the war zone, it's chaos. Soldiers wander around in headless chicken mode. Many are dead.\u00a0Many more will soon be.\n\nIn a way, we are like that anthill. We have built a complex, successful \u00a0civilization. We have welfare systems\u00a0and Bretton Woods institutions. We have advanced democracy and free, compulsory education. We have market regulators and central banks and human rights and\u00a0knowledge economies. These are no illusion.\u00a0Stand in the London Stock Exchange, or under the Eurotower in Frankfurt, and revel\u00a0in the might of the West.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Yet we are struggling, and\u00a0we might be\u00a0failing</strong>. A many-sided crisis \u00a0\u2013 financial, environmental, ideological, societal \u2013 eats away at our system. We all feel something's not right, and the feeling is strongest\u00a0in the European Union.\u00a0Look at the graduates without a future, leaving <em>en masse</em> Italy and Portugal and Romania. Look at the many Greeks who have <a href=\"/en/opencare/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care\">lost their right to health care</a> along with their jobs. Look at the\u00a0many migrants and refugees seeking to make a new home in Europe, and at Europe being unable to cope. Look at the malcontent, the tensions, the loss of hope.\u00a0\n\nNow take another look at our\u00a0anthill. See? There is no sharp line dividing the two zones. The behaviour of individual ants in the center\u00a0is different from that of their sisters in the war zone: that's obvious. Yet, it is not clear just <em>where</em>\u00a0war\u00a0zone behaviour kicks in. There is a transition zone, where ants are neither at peace nor in chaos. They see\u00a0the threat,\u00a0but they are far enough from immediate danger for panic not to be the only option. They can, and do, try to respond, warn their sisters, coordinate.\u00a0\n\nWelcome to the edge.\u00a0\n\nTransition zones is where most edgeryders live. It is there,\u00a0we believe, you will find\u00a0the key to successful societal adaptation. Why? Simple: because only there do you find both the incentives and the capacity to drive change. <strong>In the center, the \u00e9lites have little incentive to adapt \u2013 they are not on the firing line. In the periphery, the dispossessed have little capacity \u2013 staying afloat is a full time job. But on the edge it makes complete sense to try long-range, radical\u00a0stuff out</strong>. And we do: we try\u00a0co-living, sharing economy, crypto currencies, open source everything and stuff that does not even have a name yet.\u00a0Some of this stuff will succeed and go mainstream, shaping the world to come.\u00a0\n\n<strong>But most, of course, will fail and go extinct</strong>. The edge generates a lot of\u00a0failure: it's just how things work. What if we could turn all that failure into information? What if we made that information into a common resource we all can learn from? There's an opportunity here.\n\nThat\u00a0same sensed\u00a0opportunity drives\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.antiheroes.org/\">Antiheroes</a>, aka\u00a0Irene and Kira. They organize\u00a0Fuckup Nights Bruxelles, where people gather to hear stories of failure\u00a0by the people who did the failing. I attended some of them, and left quite impressed. Stories of failure\u00a0are rich, and drive storyteller and listeners to build alternative worlds. What was the cause of X? What could you have done (but did not do)\u00a0to fix Y? How could you not see Z coming? \u00a0And there is an added bonus:\u00a0you can't talk about failure without being candid. You have to stop pretending you are brilliant and successful and on top of things all the time. <strong>This creates an environment low on hustling and strong on truth</strong>. Learning ensues. So do human compassion and fraternity, because \u2013 guess what \u2013 everybody fails.\u00a0\n\nSo, Edgeryders teamed up with Antiheroes to produce our next community event: Living On The Edge 5 \u2013 fail/unFail. It will be community-driven and no-spectators, like earlier LOTEs.\u00a0It will focus on failure, like Fuckup Nights. As always, it will welcome everyone, especially the Edgeryders and Antiheroes communities.\u00a0\n\nLOTE5's program is still in development, but it already lists cutting-edge activities and participants.\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Ezio Manzini, one of\u00a0the\u00a0world's most famous\u00a0service\u00a0designers, leads a workshop on <strong>how to make our own care services</strong>.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>U.

Our plans currently include:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\tOn May 18th, in BERLIN, just before the start of the European Citizen Science Conference: a \"CAPS Community meeting and workshop\" aiming at sharing results and gathering ideas (in an interactive style, world caf\u00e9/open space) for the next workprogramme. Given its collocation, it would be more focused on participatory approaches to solve environmental challenges, collaborative making, or collaborative consumption, benefiting from sensors, community networks and distributed architectures for decentralised data governance.</li>\n\n<li>\tOn June 29th, in BRUSSELS: a workshop on Digital Social Innovation organised by the DSI4EU coordination and support action in order to present success stories an give policy recommendations to the EU on how best to address the related challenges in future policy and research actions. This would probably be particularly relevant for strongly policy-oriented areas such as open democracy, open policy making, collaborative economy.</li>\n\n<li>\tIn November or later (date and place to be defined), a very large conference to showcase the CAPS approaches in all different areas. This will be organised by the CHIC coordination and support action, which unfortunately has not started yet.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nFor the next two events, and in particular for the Berlin one, I am urgently seeking your advice and help in order to define its detailed agenda. Can you please let me know, as soon as possible (by next week), which of these events you are planning to attend, with how many people, and the main subjects you would like to present/discuss at them?\n\nI suggest:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Attending the Berlin conference. In my opinion, the most interesting aspect of OpenCare so far is its\u00a0engagement model, already quite deeply embedded in the workings of many communities quite far-removed from the EU, so we could present that. I suggest a very honest presentation, admitting the differences in narratives and working styles out there.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Skipping the Brussels seminar. I don't think it's relevant to us.</li>\n\n<li>Definitely attending the November conference. I think originally they wanted to do this in Lisbon in September, back-to-back with a W3C event, but probably they are late with this CHIC thing and need to reschedule. That's the important one.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWorks? Who wants to go to Berlin? From the Edgeryders side, Nadia (and UDK students) is a natural.

In this initiative, \u201cAlliance Fran\u00e7oise\u201d and CounterFoto being our strategic partners supported along with their venues.\n\n<strong>Case studies:</strong>\n\nI do believe that they are \u201cDifferently Abled\u201d and this terminology brings the positive vibe\u00a0\u00a0 and disability is at the end about our mindset and exclusion free society is important through more engagement and employment but still struggling for inclusion. We successfully ended our\u00a0 year along with participation in\u201d Social Enterprise Day\u201d,29 th December 2015 powered by British Council and facilitated by \u201c Better Stories\u201d at their official venue. From that venture, we felt more motivated to engage them while creating a space for their income generation. After that, we initiated more activities towards arts and crafts, with a successful art exhibition at the residence of Netherlands Embassy, May 2016. We got more opportunity to interact with the creative people and one of our artists Muhammad Sohel Ahmed got the opportunity to start his career as graphics designer at \u201cRed and Orange\u201d communication ,before him it was another deaf and mute youth who bagged a job in a local advertising media, DOT3PRD, who is Shafayth Hossain Asif (23) working as a graphics designer in advertising media.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJannatul Ferdous Srity (23) another deaf and mute female artist, who worked as an intern along with a national NGO, Democracywatch. Mashiat Tanin (22) another artist is studying at the University of Development Alternative.\n\n<strong>Our targeted stakeholders</strong>\n\nWe felt these spaces and inclusion for the differently abled would be the biggest challenge for our foundation and that is what has become a driven factor to start this new initiative to create a\u00a0 space for deaf and mute artists for their income\u00a0 generation along with the collaboration with the Embassies. As the head of Chancery Mr. Tanvir Kabir\u00a0 from Bangladesh High Commission in Mexico\u00a0 bought the deaf and mute artists paintings and an exhibition was held in Mexico City as well. The thing is still now the popularization of\u00a0 buying paintings and it\u2019s customers are limited, so we are focusing on more innovative design according to the demand of the market and apart from paining, we are also selling wool made products, handmade potteries and miniature arts as well through the online page of \u201cMagical Art of Silence\u201d.

To my mind question 4 is probably the one with the most potential - perhaps even more if you turn it around. How can the community stuff be accelerated by routing it through ER? (E.g. what engagement forms are inclusive, sustainable, and fail \"non-catastrophically\"?) The precise answer to question 1 may be influenced through this as well.\n\nA conservative estimate of question 1 would not require an accelerator program though. This is probably something you can get sufficiently precise numbers from literature, or perhaps a MOOC on entrepreneurship, no?\n\nQuestion 2 ditto I would expect. The interesting question to me is here: How is the ratio of successful/failed applications, and how does that break down into work hours. If (and I am pretty sure of that) we don't like what we see there, which levers should we be pulling on? Bring in more people to grant writing? Train more ( http://www.welcomeurope.com/europe-training-subsidies/fp7-innovation-projects-obtain-fp7-funds-european-research-projects-153+53.html )? Pile more experts into each grant? Apply more (where are the bottlenecks, how to \"protect brand\")? Focus more?\n\nQuestion 3 is very interesting as it could improve the running costs/income ratio. It sounds to me like the natural next step in business development. Possibly some \"learn from each other\" / exchange in kind method could work for this. Of course then the question is with whom (on our side, and their side)?\n\nHonestly, I am not sure I can suggest good people here. I know a handful in the consulting business (freelance, E&amp;Y, McK) but I am not sure they could bring much to the table for this question. But who knows, if it helps you seeing who are potential allies and who are definite competitors...\n\nPerhaps the chances would be better with people that moved back out of consulting into entrepreneurship.\n\nOn the margin: Anecdotally, the margin in specialized technical areas can be very high, and this probably an area that is generally fairly well suited for Open Consultancy for several reasons.\n\nOn pure management consultancy there is of course a broad span from scraping by (or not) to the big four.\n\nOn my general discomfort with entrepreneurship schools/accelerators: Put bluntly I see many of them as either (1) an extension of a dysfunctional education system that can't land people in paid work, and thus starts charging people for making their own workplaces (in pretty much the same racket). (2) A middleman that tries to insert itself between doers and investors in order to secure a cut and control direct access to investors.\n\nMind you, this is a general statement. I saw lots of interesting people on the mentor rosters, and I am sure this really works out for all side in some instances.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-10-12 15:45:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:41.615778", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 495, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [16998], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13897, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1278, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>ID\u00c9tr and Emploi Quebec programs</b>\n\nI tried to give John a hand with 'creating a non-profit focused on this area'.\n\nI applied to the program <a href=\"http://www.idetr.com/fr/index.aspx\">Innovation and Economic Development</a> (ID\u00c9tr) of City of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (where I live).

What do you think, does it make sense for Edgeryders to pursue this path of being part of a multi-stakeholder research project? Let's include initial planning for this in the next director's call maybe ...\n\nThe above is far more professional (but also longer-term) than trying the fastest path to self-sustainability of a lean startup, which I intended initially when proposing the experiment above: something that can provide the kernel for growing a user community around network bartering.

Indeed, Edgeryders\u2019 own initiatives to address the perceived shortcomings of formal education are featured in several mission reports, including, amongst others, benvickers\u2019 <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/spotlight-social-innovation/mission_case/professional-reality-development\">Professional Reality Development</a> and higiacomo\u2019s <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/quest-paid-work/mission_case/passion-volunteer-job-passion-again\">Passion -&gt; Volunteer -&gt; Job -&gt; Passion again?</a> \u00a0The fact that so many Edgeryders\u2019 personal projects are internet-based peer-to-peer learning/sharing environments is, I think, revealing.\u00a0 Not only does it draw attention to the skills/knowledge gaps that young people leave formal education with, but, more importantly, to the fact that they have the willingness and the ability (learned or innate) to be able to fill these gaps themselves, potentially supporting countless peers in the process.\u00a0 As a result, Edgeryders are developing new cultures of learning by appropriating virtual spaces and constructing their own effective and efficient means of learning, exploring and sharing alongside peers.\u00a0\n\nThese virtual spaces and online tools are dynamic and responsive to individuals\u2019 present needs (for instance, allowing users to learn at their own pace or gain tailored, real-time support from community members), and their development is arguably more likely to result in a generation of young people who are themselves dynamic and responsive in the ways they go about addressing contemporary social challenges. There is considerable scope for online resources to fulfil some of the learning needs that Edgeryders feel are missing from formal education, but there are also questions worthy of consideration around the scope of these tools and the ways in which this sort of learning is perceived within work places and working cultures that, as the <em><a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaign/making-living\">Making A Living</a> </em>campaign suggests, can still be suspicious of innovation and entrepreneurialism amongst the young.\u00a0\n\nFirst, on the subject of scope, it might be pertinent to ask whether online peer-to-peer learning is useful only as a way of developing an existing knowledge base, for example, strengthening existing abilities in mathematics or languages; or could some knowledge or skills be learned <em>ab initio?</em>\u00a0 Perhaps Edgeryders have examples already that might respond to this question.\n\nThe second area that requires consideration is how new youth-led learning cultures are responded to by both formal education providers and employers/collaborators.\u00a0 Will schools and universities step up to better prepare their students for the \u201creal world\u201d or will students continue to be left to self-teach?\u00a0 One of the most significant barriers within formal education seems to be the discomfort associated with collaborative working \u2013 or, perhaps more accurately, the administrative difficulties of fairly grading students working together on group projects.\u00a0 Can the educational establishment innovate and develop more creative, dynamic forms of learning that still allow administrative boxes to be ticked?\n\nIt isn\u2019t all about education systems, however.\u00a0 The workplace also needs to be receptive to, and collaborate in, new ways of working and new ways of thinking about skills and employability.\u00a0 While many university courses now offer opportunities for work experience as part of the course, this is by no means true across the board, particularly for less vocational subjects in the arts, humanities and social sciences.\u00a0 The benefits of these opportunities, however, are manifold \u2013 and not only to students.\u00a0 Employers, too, stand to gain from being forced to rethink their attitudes to recruitment and young people\u2019s skills sets.\u00a0 As Adria suggests in her mission report, <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/first-lessons-work/mission_case/theres-gonna-be-some-changes-made\">There\u2019s gonna be some changes made</a>, it may only be with hindsight that learning from university and the workplace make sense when both are reflected on together, but having the opportunity to reflect on these parallel learning experiences may contribute to the self efficacy Edgeryders rightly seek. In essence, if working life is set to become increasingly individualised \u2013 that is, characterised by non-standard, portfolio careers \u2013 then education needs to prepare young people for this \u201cnew kind of working life\u201d.\u00a0\n\nEdgeryders demonstrably want to be able to pursue their passions in ways that support their communities and create positive change, but also offer them a sense of achievement, recognition and self efficacy.\u00a0 What would an education system look like that can act as a solid preparation for a workplace that is in constant flux and, at present, full of uncertainty?\u00a0 Would it be formal, informal, or both?\u00a0 And to what extent will young people themselves be knowledge producers and communicators, as well as consumers?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-18 06:46:19", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 18:40:12.629308", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1196, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 20.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 7344, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5036, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Love this</b>\n\n...but how do I sign up?

People prepared to teach each other skills. Therapists to help volunteers in need of trauma support. So, the highest-impact technologies are those that help bring people together. Share knowledge. Distribute human resources across different care contexts. These technologies are connectors: they help string together and coordinate human efforts.\n\nAt Edgeryders, we have resolved to put this lesson into practice. We are doing it by hacking the most fundamental connecting technology of all: the home.\n\n<strong>BUILDING THE REEF: a community property for everyone</strong>\n\n19-21 October 2017, Brussels\n\n<a href=\"/t/openvillage/788\">edgeryders.eu/openvillage</a>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\">For TRACK\u00a03</h3>\n\n<small class=\"noclass\">#OPENVILLAGE + OpenVillage Logo</small>\n\nHow do we make it attractive to finance community ecosystems and networks of social clinics for the future?\n\nA suicide, a careerist losing out for becoming a family caregiver, a high school dropout, a veteran affected by PTSD turning tramp, and so many others, are all ultimately failures of welfare. This is often a larger failure of society, of its culture of cohesion and mutuality.

Practical info</h2>\n\n* 3 ways of paying yourself: salary as a board member; salary as an employee; through dividends (the salary =/ monthly payment, it still means you are paid based on invoice).\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;Recommended: board member, based on invoice. Companies with employees are discouraged in the current setup. The employee/board member recommended payment ratio is 17%/30% and the board member salary cannot be less 250 euros.\n\n* Income tax 20% + social security tax 33%: if you are paying social security in your residence country, you need to get a proof so you are exempt by Estonian authorities. The proof is an A1 Form from your local tax authority.\n\n* The tax is withhold every time when you pay yourself.\n\n* Rent / office space outside of Estonia is not considered a deductible expense.\n\n* There is no bank commission when invoicing from an Estonian company to another.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--2\">2. Taxes</h2>\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. In general</h3>\n\nIn Estonia we do not have a profit tax, so if you keep all the company income in the company or reinvest it, you will enjoy a 0% CIT. You will only need to pay taxes when you take money out of the company, so when paying a salary or taking out dividends, taxes apply. Please have a look at our FAQ section on receiving funds [here]: (https://www.leapin.eu/faq/receiving-funds&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498113596810000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFA_i79QjmLkf9fGr2S3hg2g8OGBw\" href=\"https://www.leapin.eu/faq/receiving-funds). I have also attached an income tax calculator to this email for you to make the necessary calculations yourself.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. How do we avoid double taxation in the countries where we reside?</h3>\n\nLeapIN currently assumes that your Estonian company will be an Estonian tax-resident and LeapIN provides you the necessary tax compliance and reporting in Estonia. Typically the tax residency of a legal entity is determined by taking into account the incorporation address, the location of actual business processes and customers and value creation and the location of its management. Thus, the final decision depends on the local tax rules in all the locations mentioned. The motivation to change the tax residency of the company could come from external parties only (your country of residence in your case). In case this issue arises, the external party has to prove their point during the negotiations with Estonian authorities, taking into account the double-taxation avoidance agreements in place. As a result, the company could also become a tax resident in both locations.To facilitate the process, in many cases countries have agreed on double taxation avoidance agreements, which specify mutually respected rules how to classify a legal entity from the tax perspective. See the [list of countries with which Estonia has double tax avoidance agreements](https://www.emta.ee/eng/business-client/income-expenses-supply-profits/international-agreements/conventions-avoidance-double).\n\nIf during the lifetime of the company, it turns out that your company will be a tax-resident in your home country (e.g. Belgium), then the tax reporting and compliance in your home country will be your responsibility. Unfortunately, at this time, LeapIN is not able to support you with tax compliance and reporting in your home country. You need to consult a tax consultant in your country for that.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-3\">2.3. Would we have to double up in accounting support in Belgium to handle our social security here?</h3>\n\nLeapIN would only take care of your Estonian company's accounting and tax compliance in Estonia and you would need to consult with a local tax consultant in your country for your personal taxes.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-4\">2.4. Dividends</h3>\n\nDistributed profits are generally subject to a flat 20% CIT at 20/80 of the net amount of profit distribution. For example, a company that has profits of 100 euros (EUR) available for distribution can distribute dividends of EUR 80, on which it must pay CIT of EUR 20.\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. Procedure</h2>\n\nThe following are step-by-step instructions for how to set up a one-person company in Estonia, as an e-resident with an E-ID card.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Sign up for services by LeapIN</h3>\n\nLeapIN takes care of all the accounting _and_ acts as a helpdesk. You can ask for advice \u2013 for payment gateways, tax related questions etc. They communicate with Estonian authorities, receive your mail, digitize your mail and forward it to you.\n\nTo sign up for their services:\n\n1. **Fill in your company background and other information.**\n\n    It's a free no-obligation sign-up, but please note that LeapIN and later our partner bank use our input in our customer review process. One business day after you have signed up and completed your planned business description, LeapIN sends back an evaluation and suggested to-dos. It will take you about 10-15 minutes to answer the questions and you can start your sign-up on the LeapIN web-page here: <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.leapin.eu/signup/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498113596765000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWU1WQCatvI2Q-CXS001ToMFDqRw\" href=\"https://www.leapin.eu/signup/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.<wbr></wbr>leapin.eu/signup/</a>\n\n    LeapIN currently strongly prefers single shareholder/board member companies and our feature set is not yet complete for meeting the needs of multiple shareholder companies. \n\n2. **Log in to [leapin.eu](http://www.leapin.eu/) with your e-mail.**\n\n3. **Authenticate yourself with your e-Residency ID-card** on our onboarding dashboard. If you need to apply and pick-up the e-Residency ID-card before, see section \"Getting e-Residency\" and then proceed to step 3.\n\n4. **Enter the required data** (company details) and accept LeapIN Service Agreement.\n\n5. **Pay** for the company registration state fee (190 EUR), state service fee for online registration (25 EUR) and LeapIN service fee for the first month.\n\nAfter completion LeapIN will continue with the company registration. Below you will find additional details to plan your roadmap for setting up your business and moving forward with LeapIN.\n\n**Fees.** Our current offer is to start with _LeapIN \u201cStarter\u201d plan_ which can be used until you start receiving revenues from customers. The price for the \u201cStarter\u201d plan is 49 EUR/mo (+ VAT). This period can last a maximum of 6 months, then you need to upgrade. There is no group package deal for more people who set up individual companies each.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Setting up the company</h3>\n\nFor a small single ownership company and as the simplest option, LeapIN helps you set up a _private limited liability company_. The Estonian business registry charges a fee of 190 EUR for registration. The minimum sum for the _share capital_ in Estonia is 2,500 EUR. It is the money that you as an individual person invest into the business, can use for running the business and you have full control over it. It is allowed to pay in the sum later, once you have the company registered and up and running. With the e-residency card, the company registration is doable _online within ca. 24 hours_ (on business days only).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Setting up banking without visiting Estonia</h3>\n\nLeapIN's partner bank LHV just postponed launching remotely opening a bank account to Q3 2017. \n\nBut just recently there were some news from Transferwise Borderless and Holvi and now it is possible to open up business bank accounts remotely using the services of these payment services providers. Please have a look at [the different banking options and their differences](https://blog.leapin.eu/b21647958a1). For a payment providers business bank account (IBAN) which enables receiving and sending money, we recommend using [Transferwise Borderless](https://transferwise.com/borderless#coverage) or [Holvi](https://about.holvi.com/) (only available for EU or EEA e-residents).\n\nLeapIN supports you doing business with Transferwise Borderless and Holvi and if your business needs change, you can migrate to a standard business bank account (or use two business bank accounts with LeapIN in parallel). Please note: in order to receive a bank card or pay dividends or pay in the share capital, you still need to open a business bank account with an Estonian bank. The issue of paying dividends we expect to be solved by the end of 2017.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-4\">3.4. Setting up banking by visiting Estonia</h3>\n\nThe following will provide a standard business bank account and bank card.\n\nFor a standard business bank account with a bank card, LeapIN recommends opening a [LHV bank account](http://www.lhv.ee/) via LeapIN. For now, the LeapIN partner bank LHV requires a physical face-to-face meeting with a bank representative (due to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism reasons). With LHV, first customers can start remotely onboarding a LHV bank account presumably in Q3 2017. Your company bank account application can be initiated after you have successfully registered your company. It takes ca 10-14 working days to receive acceptance from the bank. In Tallinn, you will need about 30 minutes on-site for the meeting with bank representatives.\n\nBefore opening a standard business bank account with LHV or similar, you can start with  Transferwise or Holvi as a temporary workaround (see above).\n\nFor the banking fees with LHV, see [their price list](https://www.lhv.ee/images/docs/Price_List-EN.pdf).", "created_at": "2017-06-21 11:01:42", "updated_at": "2019-03-06 16:55:55.748963", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1787, "wiki": true, "reads": 9, "score": 3611.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3791], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2922, "user_id": 2113, "topic_id": 2889, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span>this workshop was very successful,, it was really nice being with people from different backgrounds with their different and unique thoughts.

Now, I know that with you guys\u00a0the\u00a0ownership of the platform itself is a lot\u00a0more open than with\u00a0a crowdsourcing platform such as, say,\u00a0<a href=\"http://plusacumen.org/chapters/\">+Acumen</a> or\u00a0<a href=\"https://openideo.com/\">OpenIDEO</a>. What you're doing builds more on the concept of open-source rather than crowdsourcing, and you're implementing it in every single part of your operation. Doing this with challenges that relate to\u00a0society and that are produced because of an intrinisic motivation is very impressive! Most other platforms that try to achieve change or develop new concepts do this based on streamlined extrinisic motivations, such as Kickstarter's rewards or simply a cash prize for the best idea.\u00a0\n\nThus, I would really like to use Edgeryders as a case-study for my thesis. I'm looking for at least two users of the platform to answer a few of my questions over Skype. The questions that I have are based on two models. Firstly, I am trying to find indicators for the quality of the interactions that take place on the platform based on <a href=\"https://books.google.nl/books?id=GO8wefdWmLIC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=prahalad+ramaswamy+co+creation+table+3+-+1&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFuoXW2aTKAhWHoA4KHRrXAEAQ6AEILTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">the framework of Prahalad and Ramaswamy</a>\u00a0(2004)\u00a0and, secondly,\u00a0I am trying to create some insight into your overall co-creation activities based on a recent model of Malmelin and Villi (2015).\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/593153766b78698c9fefd235d919433ab33fe1de.jpg\" width=\"572\" height=\"500\">\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e3e1ed8a740d8acbd863606ee9f3cf2737affae7.jpg\" width=\"502\" height=\"500\">\n\nEven if you're not willing to be interviewed over Skype, it would be very helpful to me if you could describe how and why you are making use of\u00a0the platform, and to which categories your\u00a0activities on the platform\u00a0fit or don't fit. Also, if you have any questions, tips, ideas, or remarks about everything I've told you so far or regarding the possible platform for Leeuwarden-Frysl\u00e2n 2018, please let me know!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-06 15:38:08", "updated_at": "2018-05-24 16:51:16.972031", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 607, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 30.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32483, "user_id": 64, "topic_id": 1675, "post_number": 37, "raw": "<b>cant wait to get started </b>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0<span>\u00a0</span><span>this is a fantastic idea.

Edgeryders is designed so that in order for you to do well in the game, your house needs to also do well. It is also designed in such a way that the players who can encourqage most collaboration between the houses are awarded special badges in recognition of their contributions to a better community for all of us. Here are the house scores so far:  \n\n[Chart of points and badges per house here]\n\nWe conceived Edgeryders game  as a  generative one made with, for and by the community. Edgeryders interact both on the online platform and offline such as in the meetups next week, and so a game should reflect this. It is a variation Enzo Mari's <a href=\"http://daddytypes.com/2006/11/29/the_fable_game_diy_storybook_by_enzo_mari.php\">Fable game</a>. It's  bit of work so I wanted to check with the community whether it's a good idea! \n\n## How To Play Edgeryders:\n\nThe game is based on interlocking cards printed with the totem animals and other characters and objects identified by the community.  Players develop narratives based on the \u2018intersections\u2019 of the cards; each new card combination brings together different characters and suggests a new story. Each card is composed of one central, and two side sections. Players contribute mission reports and collaborate to create the cards and narratives. <a href=\"http://edgedev.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-20-at-6.59.52-PM.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1751\" height=\"420\" src=\"http://edgedev.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-20-at-6.59.52-PM.png\" title=\"Screen shot 2012-01-20 at 6.59.52 PM\" width=\"994\"></a>\n\n<strong>The proposed rules (please give feedback, it's your game!):</strong> Each House is responsible for putting together 6 cards (one for each <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaigns\">Campaign</a> or theme). At their disposal they have: the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int\">edgeryders platform</a>, the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog\">edgeryders blog</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Edgeryders\">facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edgeryders\">twitter</a> accounts, and the visual assets necessary to make the cards as well as a house coordinator from the edgeryders staff to help if needed.\n\n1. Complete the Campaign: A card is composed of one central, and two side sections- and they are filled in by players, every completed <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/show/missions\">mission</a> adds a missing part of the card. In order for a card to be considered complete, all members of a house need to have posted a mission report for each mission in a <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/campaigns\">campaign</a>. There is one card for each campaign, to pass across the finish line, a house needs it's members to have completed all the campaigns.\n\n2. More people make a richer story: each of the totem animals in the central section of the house cards, is made up of small shapes called tangrams. Each tangram is a link to a submitted ryde. The more players, the more detailed  the totem animal, and the richer the data informing the policy recommendations ie.e the heavier they weigh.\n\n3. A card needs a backgrounds, other characters, and objects: each house will have to select the most important backgrounds, characters and objects for each story. This is done by reading mission reports posted by members of same house and asking questions to uncover them. Think of each mission report posted as one where there alot of characters, background and objects to be discovered. You get to them by reading the reports and interacting with the mission report authors to discover them.\n\n## Where will this all go?\n\nDiscovering the world Edgeryders are building is the equivalent of  generating narratives from different combinations of the cards generated by the communitie's personal stories- their submissions in reponse to the mission briefs. And devising recommendations is the equivalent of understanding how the different characters interact with one another and hown they can be excited into at least not standing in the way of developmnents that are good for everyone, and ideally can actively contribute towards achieving them. At the end of this all, we will create a Massive deck of Cards: The best card for each campaign will be selected by the community and together they will form the official Edgeryders Game Deck. We'll commission them in a huge format to set the backdrop/ scenogrqaphy of the conference in Strasbourg in May. The Edgeryders with the largest number of badges and points for their contributions to a card will be invited to host a session during the conference as a representative of the community for a campaign. With the proceeds going towards an Edgeryders -project selected for support by the community.", "created_at": "2012-01-23 22:45:42", "updated_at": "2017-09-15 13:58:50.562820", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 875, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17210, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1556, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Explore furthermore benefits of being involved in craftsmanship</b>\n\nHumm, I asked you what sort of things you like to learn, because I suspected - I made the hypothesis - that someone so prone to learning must be very curious, and also a good observer.\n\nOf course, if you work in the area of information technology, your main interest will lie there.\n\nBut you talk about your children, you care about the legacy you are building not only for one generation, but further generations. So this means - another hypothesis - that you care about values a lot.

He is a professional sociologist-philosopher.\u00a0 I haven't read his books (you inspire me to read them). From what I understand from the book reviews, Sennett seems to be arguing that while we are working, submerged processes of thought and feeling are in progress. Doing our own work well would enable us to imagine larger categories of \"good\" in general, according to Sennett.\n\nThat is interesting... Being dedicated to one's work would lead to become enlightened? (according to Sennett). We can make a link between Sennett's views of finding happiness in work, and the statistics of disengaged workers, causing considerable losses to the global economy.\n\nCan the craftsman's lifestyle and philosophy help us - as a society - to regain happiness and well being?\n\nI invite you to read Nadia's mission report about practical resilience, <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/practical-resilience/mission_case/making-living-autonomy-and-resilience\">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/practical-resilience/mission_case/making-living-autonomy-and-resilience</a>.

It could be tech (build your own control interface for your wheelchair) or more social (try inter-generational co-housing as an alternative to the \u201csensors-on-the-old-folks\u201d approach).

Who debates? An emergent Future of Care community we grow starting by the preliminary work done by Edgeryders and others in 2014. The harvested stuff is fed back to the debate for efficiency and inclusivity (summaries are friendly to late-comers). This is mostly Edgeryders + SCIMpulse.</li>\n\n<li><strong>A prototyping layer</strong>. This is not a website, but one or more physical spaces where the prototyping happens, with appropriate hosting and facilitation. I imagine Politecnico as the leading partner here, but I guess everybody will want to be involved, at least a bit.</li>\n\n<li><strong>A system-level design layer</strong>, working on the policy proposal. This is not debate, but design by collective intelligence. I imagine a wiki, as a first approximation, but we could look into more complex design environments. I imagine the Stockholm School of Economics as the leader on this, with a robust contribution from Ezio's service design wisdom.</li>\n\n<li><strong>A collective intelligence harvesting/feeding layer.</strong>\u00a0This is our technological system. It lives on top of all three interaction environments (online debate, physical space, design environment), and helps collective intelligence by aggregating what is being said and done and feeding it back to the community. Ways need to be found to make the aggregation methods and results transparent and simple to read for the community, like visualization. I imagine LABRI to take the lead here \u2013 so we can expect our approach to be skewed towards network science.</li>\n\n</ol>", "created_at": "2015-01-30 08:26:23", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 13:27:44.499511", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 682, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3189, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 3156, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<style type=\"text/css\">\n\n.tftable {font-size:14px;color:#333333;width:1100px;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}\n\n.tftable th {font-size:12px;color:#FFFFFF;font-weight:800;background-color:#f1472b;padding: 8px;text-align:left;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse;}\n\n.tftable tr {background-color:#ffffff;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse;}\n\n.tftable td {font-size:14px;border-width: 1px;padding: 8px;text-align:left; vertical-align:top; }\n\n.tftable tr:hover {background-color:none;}\n\n.tftable img {}\n\n.tftable2 {font-size:14px;color:#333333;width:1100px;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}\n\n.tftable2 th {font-size:14px;font-weight:800;color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#f1472b;border-width: 1px;padding: 8px;border-style: solid;border-color: \\#729ea5;text-align:left;}\n\n.tftable2 tr {background-color:#ffffff;}\n\n.tftable2 td {font-size:14px;border-width: 1px;padding: 8px;border-style: solid;border-color: \\#729ea5;width:30%;vertical-align:top;}\n\n.tftable2 tr:hover {background-color:#ffff99;}\n\n.tftable2 img {width:100%; height:auto;}\n\n.tftable2 h3 {color:#f1472b; font-weight:800;}\n\n.tftable3 {font-size:24px;font-weight:800;color:#333333;width:100%;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}\n\n.tftable3 th {font-size:34px;color:#f1472b;font-weight:100;padding: 8px;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse;text-align:left;}\n\n.tftable3 tr {background-color:#ffffff;border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse;}\n\n.tftable3 td {font-size:24px;font-weight:800;padding: 8px;border-style:border: 0px solid \\#729ea5;border-collapse: collapse;text-align:left; vertical-align:middle; height:30%; }\n\n.tftable3 tr:hover {background-color:none;}\n\n.tftable h1 {color:#666666;}\n\n.tftable h2 {color:#f1472b;}\n\n.tftable h3 {color:#f1472b; font-weight:800;}\n\n.tftable3 h1 {color:#f1472b;font-weight:100;  }\n\n.tftable3 h2 {color:#000000;font-weight:800;}\n\n.tftable3 h3 {color:#f1472b;font-weight:100;font-size:142px;}\n\n.rtxt {color:#f1472b; font-weight:800;}\n\n.gtxt {color:#666666;}\n\n.lg-txt {text-align:center;font-size:16px;}\n\n.brack {color:#f1472b;font-weight:100;font-size:142px;}\n\n.name {font-weight:800;}\n\n</style>\n\n<table class=\"tftable\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr>\n\n<th width=\"350px\">\u00a0</th>\n\n<th width=\"350px\"></th>\n\n<th>\u00a0</th>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><img src=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/lote4/fabrizio-s.jpg\"></td>\n\n<td><img src=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/lote4/benvickers-s.jpg\"></td>\n\n<td style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"><center>\n\n<h1>#LOTE4</h1>\n\n<h2>Stewardship\n\n<span>23-26 October, 2014\n\n(location t.b.c)</span>\n\n</h2>\n\n</center></td>\n\n<center>\n\n</center>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Fabrizio Barca</span> General Director for Development at the Italian Treasury. </td>\n\n<td>\n\n<strong>Ben Vickers</strong> Curator of Digital at Serpentine Gallery,unAbbot at the unMonastery.</td>\n\n<td></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><img src=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/lote4/amelia-s.jpg\"></td>\n\n<td><img src=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/lote4/nadia-s.jpg\"></td>\n\n<td><span><center>We believe the ability to come together to take care of assets in an unstable context is a key skill for surviving and thriving in the future.\n\nThis event aims to set the foundations for a global Stewardship ecosystem encouraging free flow of information, knowledge and actors between different contexts, sectors and leadership roles.</center></span></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\n\n<strong>Amelia Andersdotter</strong> Chair of the European Pirate Party.

The \n\noverarching logic behind this development and acquisition is \n\ngenerally to enable the provision of public services. In recent \n\ndecades this model has become overstretched: states have \n\nfound themselves struggling to find the resources to keep \n\nthose assets manned so that provision of such services could \n\ncontinue, and had to retreat from many non-core services. \n\nConsequently, many such assets lie unused; some are \n\nbeginning to deteriorate. \n\nIn an effort to correct this situation, some public assets have \n\nbeen turned over to the private sector. This move has had \n\nmixed results: while some financial advantages for states have \n\nindeed materialized, at least in the short term, many \n\nprivatization programs suffer unintended consequences. The \n\ngeneral consensus seems to be that it might be interesting to \n\nexplore new avenues.\n\nCommunities have been singled out as candidates for taking \n\ncare of some public assets, in particular those that can be used \n\nto provide services to the community itself.\n\nThere is now evidence available to indicate that communities \n\ncan indeed provide stewardship. The EdgeRyders community \n\nhas itself accumulated significant experience in this area. We \n\nbelieve the ability to come together to take care of assets in an \n\nunstable context is a key skill for surviving and thriving in the \n\nfuture.</td>\n\n<td><center>\n\n<h1>#LOTE4</h1>\n\n<h2>Stewardship\n\n<span>23-26 October, 2014\n\n(location t.b.c) </span><center>\n\n<img src=\"http://www.immateriallabour.com/lote4/unmonshot.jpg\" width=\"280px\" height=\"auto\">\n\n</center>\n\n</h2>\n\n</center></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n\n<table class=\"tftable2\" border=\"1\">\n\n<tr>\n\n<th style=\"width:10%;\"></th>\n\n<th>Day 1</th>\n\n<th>Day 2</th>\n\n<th>Day 3</th>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">08:00 - 09:30</td>\n\n<td>Welcome breakfast</td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">09:30 - 10:00</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Fabrizio Barca</span>, General Director for Development at the Italian Treasury // <span>Ben Vickers</span>, unAbbot at the unMonastery</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Amelia Andersdotter</span>, Chair of the European \n\nPirate Party// <span>Giulio Quaggiotto</span>, Pulse Lab \n\nManager at UN Global Pulse</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>William Gumede</span>, Founder Democracy Works\n\nFoundation// <span>Pam Warmhurst</span>, Incredible\n\nEdible\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">10:00 - 10:30</td>\n\n<td>Coffee break\n\n</td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n<td> </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n\n<table class=\"tftable2\" border=\"1\"><tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">10:40 - 11:05</td>\n\n<td style=\"background-color:#ffded8;width:90%;\">\n\n<span>Who are the key actors and trends in Stewardship?</span> Overview of the three parallel sessions</td>\n\n</tr></table>\n\n<table class=\"tftable2\" border=\"1\">\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width:10%;\">11: 05 - 13:00</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Participants:</span> <span>Hazem Adel</span>, Edgeryders Egypt\n\ncommunity manger// <span>Alessia Zabatino</span>, Project\n\ncoordinator for Open Pompeii// <span>Dougald Hine</span>,\n\nFounder at Brixton Pound// <span>Ela Kagel</span>, Founder at\n\nSupermarkt// <span>Pier Francesco Maran</span>, Alderman,\n\nCity of Milan//<span>J\u00f6rgen Hermansson</span>, Deputy Vice-\n\nChancellor at Uppsala University // You.\n\n</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Participants:</span> <span>Paul Keller</span>, Supervisory Board\n\nMember at DutchCulture, centre for international\n\ncooperation // <span>Annemarie Naylor</span>, Common\n\nFutures// <span>Simone Cortesi</span>, Founder of Open\n\nStreet Map// <span>Matthias Ansorg</span>, Founder of\n\nMakerfox and Earth OS.// <span>David De Ugarte</span>, Socio\n\nde la Sociedad de las Indias Electr\u00f3nicas You.\n\n</td>\n\n<td>\n\n<span>Participants:</span> <span>Robin Chase</span>, Buzzcar// <span>Daniel\n\nVaarik</span>, Memokraat// <span>Caroline Paulick-Thiel</span>,\n\nFounder of Prosumetime// <span>Petros</span>, Founder at\n\nFreedomlab // <span>Aidan Eyakuze</span>, Associate\n\nRegional Director at Society for international\n\nDevelopment// <span>Vinay Gupta</span>, Associate at UCL\n\nInstitute for Security &amp;

This will help me find the threads in the groups more easily (and, by the way--- is there an easy way of getting to these organically? It is challenging\u00a0to find non-challenge problem Open Care contributions from the main Open Care page).\u00a0\n\nSome things to enable/change on\u00a0Open Ethnographer that I would find useful (and I am happy to have another call about this as I know there are quite a few things here):\u00a0\n\n- ability to tag one entry with multiple tags\u00a0without having to exit bubble. Right now I type in the tag, hit save, and then must re-highlight that text in order to tag it again.\u00a0\n\n- minor, but for speed: cursor to\u00a0begin on tag, not on comment (tags are used much more frequently, so additionally\u00a0flipping the location of \"tag\" and \"comment\"\u00a0would be helpful too)\u00a0\n\n- make bubble/window\u00a0disappear (the coding one) for higher level tags (e.g. \"case studies\"). I find it useful to be able to categorize different kinds of information (so, tagging something as a \"case study/example\" or a \"research question\" vs descriptive tags like \"health and art\" or \"mental health\"). Some of the higher level tags cover significantly\u00a0more text (like highlighting an entire \"case study\")\u00a0which causes the tag window to automatically pop up when I try to go back in and code smaller sections of already coded text. This makes it hard to use.\u00a0\n\n- ability\u00a0to tag\u00a0a whole post \u00a0to better categorise posts (e.g. \"health and art\"). This is related to the previous note. Many of the posts have larger overarching themes that run through entire post (same with comments) so it would be helpful to have the functionality to tag the whole post and not just snippets of text. If the above problem were fixed I could just highlight the entire thing, but that would create a lot of clutter when viewing the text content of tags in a different view.\u00a0\n\n- Separation of Inga's\u00a0tags from mine so I can properly edit my tags. This is something I brought up in the call, but it is really important to be able to easily change a tag after use (for example, after tagging several posts as \"getting outdoors\" it became clear that \"location-based\" or \"place-based\"\u00a0was the better phrase to use for the tag.) Additionally, it would be very useful to have an easy way to edit the tags' phrasing without going to the hierarchy page, but if that isn't possible it's okay as long as I can see the Open Care tags\u00a0without seeing the ones from other projects.\u00a0\n\n- Finally, what Guy discussed at the meeting would be useful --- it would be VERY helpful to have a visual hierarchy of tags that I could edit by dragging and dropping tags. I realize this is a more difficult ask than the above, but some tags are qualitatively different than other kinds of tags and being able to reflect this would be useful. \u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-23 09:41:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:57.142038", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 607, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3310], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19214, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4347, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Agree</b>\n\nEh, yeah that community call is on Thursday... had that alarm set already.\n\nI hope the new location works out fine!

The legal jargon is purely there to re-enforce the existing social contract in a way that makes explicit how people are supposed to behave, and helps avoid future conflict because the quid-pro-quo's are explicitly laid out in a manner that is enforcable within the existing legal jurisdictions.\n\nThe GPL and the CC licensing regimes, are a couple of excellent hacks within the legal system.\n\nThey are important because they help protect us from the bad actors who would end up ripping us off. Over 30 years experience in the creative industries has taught me that there are a lot of sharks out there, and setting up the protections necessary, and making them explicit, and legally enforcable, means that 95% of the scumbags and psychopaths will go looking for an easier mark.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's also good to see the transparency of this conversation.

(The marketplace is <a href=\"https://epelia.com/\">epelia.com</a>, and for more information see the <a href=\"http://fairdirect.org/blog/category/nepal-coffee\">official project blog</a>.)\n\nThe idea is to pioneer \"globalization done right\": leaving out trade middlemen creates a novel, P2P way of economic development. No donations needed, just paying normal market prices while farmers (in this case here) will get more than double for their coffee beans. For them, coffee suddenly becomes an economic opportunity. \"Our\" six farmers explain a bit more about their current difficulties with coffee farming in this beautiful mini documentary that Eva, Matjaz and @Dipti_Sherchan shot for this project in Hansapur in early December:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvagkP-bzy8\n\nEdgeryders LbG funded the setup of this first \"direct trade hub\" in Hansapur, Nepal, and that's why there is \"Edgeryders powered\" coffee now :-) If anyone here wants to try their hands on the product packaging for this, you are very welcome. Here's the list of must-have and nice-to-have requirements (off the top of my head, might change a bit lateron still):\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Style: just like the video, the charme of this product is its down-to-earth simplicity and authenticity. So, no high-gloss expensive packaging of course.</li>\n\n<li>Packaging material: A brown food-grade paper bag as used for grains etc. is our preferred backaging option for now. Eco-friendly, down-to-earth and cheap. (Green coffee beans do not need anything more fancy: no vacuum packaging etc. since the coffee is not roasted yet, so no aroma to deteriorate by oxygen contact.)</li>\n\n<li>Label: The bag would get a sticker applied to it \u2013 which would be the main part to be designed (apart from selecting the exact bag and designing ways to close it etc. of course, if you like to dive into this).</li>\n\n<li>The \"brand\" is always the name of the farmer, as seen in the shop names on epelia.com. So we have six different brands. If the label could be made in a way that (say) 4 of them are delivered on an A4 sheet and we can print in the different \"brand names\" by running these sheets through a black-and-white laser printer, it would be perfect. Means, if all the parts that differ between different sellers are black and white, it would be perfect.</li>\n\n<li>Logos: The farmers are the ones selling this (it's \"their product\"), so both the Fairdirect and Edgeryders organizations can \"only\" appear in a supporter / enabler role on the label, not as manufacturer. For example, put both their labels somewhere with a \"Brought to you by:\" or \"Supporting organizations:\" line or similar.</li>\n\n<li>There is a \"Product Fairness Level\" indicator that is a main part of this sales system. It's (for now) always the second product photo (for example <a href=\"https://epelia.com/products/34424/\">here</a>). That kind of thing incl. the QR code should be part of the label, but it may be redesigned.</li>\n\n<li>The usual, legally required product information on the label is:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Contents: 500 g</li>\n\n<li>Ingredients: coffee beans (unroasted)</li>\n\n<li>Best before: [some free space for printing a date with the laser printer]</li>\n\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAll that said, please don't feel restricted by the above.

We need observable events, and enough variance in the\u00a0date\u00a0to build counterfactuals. People moving from talk to action is not observable from where I stand. This is why we retreat to observing the interaction itself, that is observable. The collective intelligence crowd (Klein, Buckingham Shum, Hammond etc.) also cannot help, because they focus on mapping arguments, and assume that, once the terms of a debate are clear, whoever is in charge of deciding can make an informed decision.\u00a0I imagine that ethnography might help: maybe you would identify certain behaviours that you want to track and look in the ethno data for signs of those behaviours. Certainly, it makes sense to use this mass of coded text we already have.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li><strong>Uniqueness</strong>. I don't think you need to worry about that. There are at least two novel pieces in the puzzle: the use of ethnographic data (hopefully also of their network representation) and the explicit interest in hacker culture. If you argue for hypothesis +1 you are going to be saying that one human culture is better at collective intelligence than others. That's a very big deal.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWith all that said, you do the work and you make the decisions. Feel free to discard or ignore my suggestions.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-01-28 10:09:50", "updated_at": "2017-11-17 03:14:53.656982", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 426, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33049], "is_liked_by": [3, 3433], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12653, "user_id": 2743, "topic_id": 4588, "post_number": 4, "raw": "\u00a0We raster images in Autocad and its an arduous job.\u00a0Photogrammetry. fascinating indeed.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-27 14:53:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:12.011997", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11845], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1929, "user_id": 1461, "topic_id": 1896, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a6a44d1c5057ad9a11f934bb07be28ce33b3ab9f.png\" width=\"687\" height=\"150\"><br>\n\n<h1 class=\"firstHeading\" id=\"firstHeading\" lang=\"en\"><span>Peeragogy Handbook V1.0/Convening</span></h1>\n\n<div id=\"contentSub\"><span><a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Peeragogy_Handbook_V1.0\" title=\"Peeragogy Handbook V1.0\">Peeragogy Handbook V1.0</a></span></div>\n\n<i>Authors</i>: <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://peeragogy.org/resources/meet-the-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gigi Johnson</a> and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://peeragogy.org/resources/meet-the-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Corneli</a>\n\n<blockquote>\n\nSo we want to try peer learning? Maybe we've already found a few people who will support you in this effort. Congratulations! It's time now to focus your thinking. How will you convene others to form a suitable group? How will you design a learner experience which will make your project thrive? In this chapter, we suggest a variety of questions that will help you to make your project more concrete for potential new members. There are no good or bad answers - it depends on the nature of your project and the context. Trying to answer the questions is not something you do just once. At various stages of the project, even after it's over, some or all of those questions will aquire new meanings - and probably new answers.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://peeragogy.org/resources/meet-the-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Fabrizio Terzi</a>: <i>\"There is a force of attraction that allows aggregation into groups based on the degree of personal interest; the ability to enhance and improve the share of each participant; the expectation of success and potential benefit.\"</i>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2><span>Group identity</span></h2>\n\nNote that there are many groups that may not need to be \u201cconvened\", since they already exist. There is a good story from <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.sarvodayausa.org/learn/a-t-ariyartne/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">A. T. Ariyaratne</a> in his <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.sarvodaya.org/about/philosophy/collected-works-vol-1/rural-self-help\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">collected works</a> in which he does \u201cconvene\" a natural group (namely, a village) - but in any case, keep in mind at the outset that the degree of group-consciousness that is necessary for peer learning to take place is not fixed. In this section, we suppose you are just at the point of kicking off a project. What steps should you take? We suggest you take a moment to ponder the following questions first - and revisit them afterward, as a way to identify best practices for the next effort.\n\n<h2><span>There will be a quiz</span></h2>\n\nThose taking the initiative should ask themselves the traditional Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How. (<a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Sinek\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Sinek</a> suggests to begin with Why, and we touched on Who, above!). In doing so, preliminary assumptions for design and structure are established. However, in peer learning it is particularly important to maintain a healthy degree of openness, so that future group members can also form their answers on those questions. In particular, this suggests that the design and structure of the project (and the group) may change over time. Here, we riff on the traditional 5W's+H with six clusters of questions to help you focus your thinking about the project and amplify its positive outcomes.\n\n<h2><span>Expectations for participants</span></h2>\n\n<b>1. Roles and flux</b>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What are some of the roles that people are likely to fall into (e.g. Newcomer, Wrapper, Lurker, Aggregator, etc.)?</li>\n\n<li>How likely is it that participants will stick with the project? If you expect many participants to leave, how will this effect the group and the outcome?</li>\n\n<li>Do you envision new people joining the group as time goes by? If so, what features are you designing that will support their integration into an existing flow?</li>\n\n<li>Will the project work if people dip in and out? If so, what features support that? If not, how will people stay focused?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<b>2. Nature of the project</b>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What skills are required? What skills are you trying to build?</li>\n\n<li>What kinds of change will participants undergo? Will they be heading into new ground? Changing their minds about something? Learning about learning?</li>\n\n<li>What social objective, or \"product\" if any, is the project aiming to achieve?</li>\n\n<li>What's the 'hook?' Unless you are working with an existing group, or re-using an existing modality, consistent participation may not be a given.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<b>3. Time management</b>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What do you expect the group to do, from the moment it convenes, to the end of its life-span, to create the specific outcome that will exist at the conclusion of its last meeting? (C. Gersick.) Note that what people ACTUALLY do may be different from what you envision at the outset, so you may want to revisit this question (and your answer) again as the project progresses.</li>\n\n<li>Keeping in mind that at least one period of is inertia is very likely (C. Gersick), what event(s) do you anticipate happening in the group that will bring things back together, set a new direction, or generally get things on track? More generally, what kinds of contingencies does your group face? How does it interface to the \"outside world\"?</li>\n\n<li>What pre-existing narratives or workflows could you copy in your group?</li>\n\n<li>How much of a time commitment do you expect from participants? Is this kind of commitment realistic for members of your group?</li>\n\n<li>What, if anything, can you do to make participation \"easy\" in the sense that it happens in the natural flow of life for group members?</li>\n\n<li>Does everyone need to participate equally? How might non-equal participation play out for participants down the line?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<b>4. Back to the future</b>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What structures will support participants in their journey to the end result(s) you (or they) have envisioned? What content can you use to flesh out this structure?</li>\n\n<li>Where can the structure \"flex\" to accommodate unknown developments or needs as participants learn, discover, and progress?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<b>5. Tool/platform choice</b>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What tools are particularly suited to this group? Consider such features as learning styles and experiences, geographical diversity, the need for centralization (or de-centralization), cultural expectations related to group work, sharing, and emerging leadership.</li>\n\n<li>Is there an inherent draw to this project for a given population, or are you as facilitator going to have to work at keeping people involved? How might your answer influence your choice of tools? Is the reward for completion the learning itself, or something more tangible?</li>\n\n<li>In choosing tools, how do you prioritize such values and objectives as easy entry, diverse uses, and high ceilings for sophisticated expansion?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<b>6. Linearity vs Messiness</b>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>How will your group manage feedback in a constructive way?</li>\n\n<li>Why might participants feel motivated to give feedback?</li>\n\n<li>How firm and extensive are the social contracts for this group? Do they apply to everyone equally, or do they vary with participation level?</li>\n\n<li>What do people need to know at the start? What can you work out as you go along? Who decides?</li>\n\n<li>How welcome are \"meta-discussions\"? What kinds of discussions are not likely to be welcome? Do you have facilities in place for \"breakout groups\" or other peer-to-peer interactions? (Alternatively, if the project is mostly distributed, do you have any facilities in place for coming together as a group?)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2><span>Cycles of group development</span></h2>\n\nThe above questions remain important thoughout the life of the project. People may come and go, particpants may propose fundamentally new approaches, people may evolve from lurkers to major content creators or vice-versa. The questions we suggest can be most effective if your group discusses them over time, as part of its workflow, using synchronous online meetings (e.g., <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.bigbluebutton.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Big Blue Button</a>, [<a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://success.adobe.com/en/na/sem/products/connect/1109_6011_connect_webinars.html?sdid=IEASO&amp;skwcid=TC%7C22191%7Cadobe%20connect%7C%7CS%7Ce%7C5894715262%7CAdobe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Connect</a>], <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.blackboard.com/platforms/collaborate/overview.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Blackboard Collaborate</a>), forums, Google docs, wikis, and/or email lists. Regular meetings are one way to establish a \"heartbeat\" for the group.\n\nIn thinking about other ways of structuring things, note that the \"body\" of the <i>Peeragogy Handbook</i> follows a <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forming-storming-norming-performing\" target=\"_blank\">Tuckman-like outline</a> (<i>Convening a Group</i> is our \"forming\", <i>Organizing a Learning Context</i> is our \"storming and norming\", <i>Co-working/Facilitation</i> is our \"performing\", and <i>Assessment</i> is our \"adjourning\"). But we agree with Gersick (and Engestr\u00f6m) that groups do not always follow a linear or cyclical pattern with their activities!\n\nNevertheless, there may be some specific stages or phases that you want <i>your</i> group to go through. Do you need some \"milestones,\" for example? How will you know when you've achieved \"success?\"\n\n<h2><span>Dealing with chaos or conflict</span></h2>\n\nIn closing, it is worth reminding you that it is natural for groups to experience conflict, especially as they grow or cross other threshold points or milestones - or perhaps more likely, when they don't cross important milestones in a timely fashion (ah, so you remember those milestones from the previous section!). Nevertheless, there are some strategies can be used to make this conflict productive, rather than merely destructive (see Ozturk and Simsek).\n\n", "created_at": "2013-09-06 20:23:43", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 04:38:46.456069", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1767, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4410, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 4377, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2015-05-11 15:12:17", "updated_at": "2017-11-13 16:49:48.029798", "deleted_at": "2017-11-13 22:15:59.066326", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14022, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 3729, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>We should ask people to bring their own cups, plates and cutlery</b>\n\nNo?
