Each party keeps his own records independently using debit and credit entries. However, double entry book-keeping records transactions which take place within a market paradigm of legal relationships (agreements - such as mortgages, limited liability corporations) and claims over value (instruments - such as equity ownership, debt and derivatives). This paradigm has evolved and become more and more sophisticated over time and has led to an unsustainable concentration of wealth.\n\n To use a sporting analogy, agreements are analogous to the rules of the game while instruments are analogous to the implements of a game such as bat and ball. \n\nThe problem with double entry book-keeping is that its associated paradigm of absolute rights of ownership and use and 'for profit' commodity transactions makes risk and production sharing difficult if not impossible. We hear a lot about the sharing economy, but simply put, shareholders (in a Joint Stock Company) are fundamentally incapable of sharing.\n\nThe split tally stick provided a record not only of conventional debt instruments but also of the simplest instrument of them all, the credit instrument or promise.  This undated promise/credit instrument actually pre-dates all other instruments, and promises required a trust framework of implicit or explicit risk and production sharing agreements.\n\nI believe that through using the correct combination of credit instruments/promises and risk, revenue and production sharing agreements it is completely possible to create a new and resilient economy bottom up and moreover to do so without requiring any permission from any third party.\n\nFor risk sharing I advocate a 'guarantee society' agreement of which the best example is the Protection and Indemnity (P&amp;I) Club in the shipping industry. Here we have seen for 140 years ship owners clubbing together (and employing a manager) to mutually assure risks that Lloyds of London ('for profit' risk intermediaries) will not take.\n\n[This article](http://www.the3rdimagazine.co.uk/2013/04/the-community-is-the-currency/) illustrates how local credit risk might be assured using the same risk sharing approach.\n\nFor production and revenue sharing we may use simple partnership agreements as referred to in my discussion with @gehan, and for long term funding of productive assets we may issue, and accept in exchange in payment for use, the credit instruments referred to.\n\nSo in relation to Open Care I believe that it is possible to create new 'Care for Land Use' swaps whereby in exchange for caring for People, Place or both, then carers may receive credits which are returnable in payment for residential or other use of land, or in payment for food production derived from land use. \n\nI envisage networks of carers - possibly using an 21st C quasi-guild approach - who share costs of a care platform (eg transport, scheduling, equipment, training and so on). In exchange for providing care, then carers may receive credits which they can use against essentials such as housing and energy use.\n\nIf (as it appears) you are interested in the application of financial technology (Fintech) you might find my article on [Fintech 2.0](https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/fintech-2-0/2016/10/06) of interest", "created_at": "2017-07-25 00:08:40.473510", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:04.548706", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 543, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 22.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33524], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69038, "user_id": 6233, "topic_id": 12459, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Please provide us with contact information about you.**\n\n**name:** Ahmed Adel Taher\n**birthplace:** 1 Sep 1993\n**residence:** Egypt, Cairo\n\n**Please read the projects' descriptions in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hNma4nO7n2_Kd7_L4_Ur2eDHCi1nQmlU41CwHKERqhM/edit\">this file</a> and write down the project names of the ones you're interested in contributing.<br/><br/> Which Project(s) do you want to be involved in?

I'm a cultural anthropologist by training and my background is mostly in human rights and policy. Before coming to Oxford to pursue a PhD, I worked as a policy officer for a human rights NGO in London, where I worked for their digital team. We focused on understanding the intersection of Internet infrastructure and human rights, most of our work involved participating in Internet governance organisations and was focused on the right to freedom of expression, access to information and privacy. Before that, I worked at the US House of Representatives, as a policy advisor on telecommunications and European affairs, for a democratic congressman.\n \n**I am primarily interested in understanding how human rights NGOs are adapting to the increased importance of digital technologies, and how they are shifting their work now that much of it has a digital component.** For example, I have NGOs focusing on providing shelter and safe houses for survivors of domestic violence have to reckon with the increased ability of abusers to surveil and track-down their partners and children using digital technologies. Or how police or immigration enforcement use AI systems that can lead to over-policing of communities of color or otherwise lead to bias and discrimination of minorities. There are many concerns, in many directions, involving many different technologies.\n\n### The relationships between technological changes and activist mobilisation?\n\nMy PhD research focuses specifically on a group of NGOs that are trying to change the internet standards and protocols to align them more with human rights by directly participating along-side engineers of big tech companies. But more broadly speaking, I am interested in the question of how technology changes or keeps the same, the work that human rights NGOs do and how they adapt to changes in their work brought by digital technologies.\n\nI've always been interested in the interaction between technology and society. When I was a bachelor student at the University of Utrecht, studying for my BA, one of my main interests was the role of social media mean and how activists mobilize. This was at the height of a number of social uprisings. Social media, and other digital technologies were often held up as revolutionary tools that would enable people to topple their governments and do all of these things. But what I found in my work was that this is just simply not the case. Social media can certainly give the plight of activists more visibility. But at the end of the day, the power, the power inequities that exists, are not inversed using these technologies. I actually found that instead of having a liberating potential, digital technologies can also entrench existing differences. Even if people feel they have more agency. And that combination is not necessarily a good thing.\n\n\n###  \"Increasingly, human rights organizations are trying to target companies and code instead of governments and laws\"\n\nWhen I started doing more research, I became interested in the inverse of what it means for civil society to use social media. Instead of looking at what happens when activists use social media, I was interested in what happens when activists try to change how social media functions or try to change how the underlying internet is built. Instead of looking at use, I started looking at design, and the interventions in the internet infrastructure made by human rights activists.\n\n**An example of this is the work of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which regularly participates in an organization that sets Internet standards.** Internet standards are something that we use every day. For instance, when it says HTTPS in your web browser, that's a standard, it's a standard that ensures whatever you type into your browser is encrypted. If you are looking for a particular medicine, or if you are looking for access to abortion, and you're doing that in a country where it is illegal the HTTPS protects you (somewhat) from being snooped on when typing in search queries on a website. And so, one of the tactics of the ACLU is to go to these companies that build these things and say: &quot;Hey, have you maybe considered encrypting Y. Or making sure X leaks less data?&quot; They try to bring a wider perspective on the social impact of protocols, one that is not necessarily included in the technical discussions when solely led by industry.\n\nAnother example of an NGO intervention aimed at tech-companies: A couple of days ago, almost 120 civil society organizations signed a letter urging Facebook, not to give governments back-door access to Facebook Messenger, and to ensure there it had strong encryption. Increasingly, human rights organizations are trying to target companies and code instead of governments and laws.\n\n\n### Case in point: privacy and law enforcement access\n\nThis debate is complicated. When it comes to the fine line between privacy and law enforcement \u2014 I'm not sure I would be doing a PhD if I had the perfect answer to this question of how to solve this stalemate \u2014 but I think there are a couple of things to disentangle.\n\nFirst, there is a....duality \u2014 I don't want to call it hypocrisy \u2014 in how some of these governments portray themselves or how some of these governments develop their positions. For example, the Dutch government: on the one hand Internet freedom is a major part of Dutch foreign policy, they were founders of the Freedom Online Coalition (FOC). And yet, at the same time, the government strategically pushes against strong encryption, prioritising the provision of access for law enforcement over privacy/encryption concerns. Depending on which debate it is, they take contradictory positions. It\u2019s easy to say: oh, countries in Europe take privacy seriously, they take freedom of expression seriously. And they do, but not consistently. It\u2019s important to be aware of these contradictions.\n\nSecond, regarding law enforcement concerns that they are going dark: There was a report a couple of years ago from the Berkman Center for Internet Society at Harvard University called [Going Dark](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/28552576). It's one of the main examples that is often given by these governments, especially law enforcement. They say, Oh, you know what, we're going dark, we don't have access anymore. But we need that kind of access. And for that access, we need you to weakened encryption. And what the report actually shows is that the enforcement officers have more information than they've ever had before. They have more ways of combining different data sets, more systems to systematically go through it. This means that their argument is not always valid, and it\u2019s important to question the rhetoric upon which arguments in favor of weakening encryption are based.\n\nAnd this is also something that the human rights NGO I work with stress: you don't necessarily solve the problem of lack of access by weakening encryption. The argument they often make is, that you don't protect your house from robbers by building a backdoor for the police, which can subsequently be used by everyone. Because that's the thing, if you create a backdoor for police, you create a backdoor for everyone. That's just how the technology functions. Those are some of issues and values we need to consider when we try to assess this debate.\n\n\n### Civil Society Advocacy aimed at AI systems and Companies\n\nThere's this running joke amongst academics that you say \u201cI do AI\u201d when you want to get funded, and you say \u201cI do Machine Learning\u201d when you want to be taken seriously academically. \n\nIn other words, there's a definition bloat in what people mean when they talk about AI or AI systems. And I think that leads to a lot of confusion. But this conceptual confusion does not make the impact of these systems, however defined, any less real. And this is also what a lot of the recent academic literature shows \u2014 that the application of AI systems can have real negative impacts on civil liberties and human rights.\n\nA prime example is when LinkedIn got into a lot of trouble because their systems tended to show CEO positions consistently to white men rather than to women or people of color. The systems had learned from the existing data, which obviously shows the societal bias, that white men tend to be more likely to hold these kinds of positions. The existing bias in society, obviously, does not speak to the inherent suitability of (white) men for these positions. But that's the kind of nuance not captured by AI systems. So, you end up in a situation where the application of these systems actually reinforces existing bias and discrimination in society, without necessarily generating better CEOs.\n\nObviously, a lot of human rights NGOs have been worried about this for a long time and have consistently tried to ring that bell \u2014 bringing in academic work to show some of these issues.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, for example, has a great program as do Amnesty International, Privacy International and Article 19. Several of the largest human rights NGOs are focusing on issues of AI systems and bias. But they're also forced to play whack-a-mole as the application of AI systems becomes more common. How to focus your resources? Which companies and applications are most concerning? Which solutions most tractable and comprehensive? Do we need sectoral guidelines, or do we need guidelines which focus on impact? Do we need self-regulatory ethics frameworks or hard data protection frameworks? All of the above? These are the issues I see a lot of NGOs grapple with.\n\nSometimes it is easy to draw a position: for example, the campaign against killer robots (lethal autonomous weapons) has brought NGOs together to formulate a clear policy goal using the international law. But not all issues are so clear-cut. And not in all cases are the developers of technology approachable or accountable.\n\nVery often, once a bit of research has been done, it is easy to show the effect of certain technologies. But part of the problem is that many of these AI systems are developed by private companies. This means it is hard to gain access to what their technology does specifically. And a lot of these companies say they don't have to explain how their tech works, as it&amp;rsquo;s their commercial secret sauce and obviously, they say they don't want to share how that works, because that undermines their business model. In other cases, it is hard to pin-point the &quot;disparate impact&quot; of a technology, even if people on the ground can feel its ramifications in terms of access to services and goods (like government support, housing, the legal system etc.).\n\nThis concern, in theory, should not apply when it's government use of these technologies. But even in those cases, when they buy \u201cAI solutions&quot; from companies, they don't always fully understand what they're buying (into). They don't, or sometimes can\u2019t, know how these systems works. So, there are a lot of issues around trying to get not just transparency, because transparency in and of itself isn't the solution, but also to get a real sense of accountability for how the systems function.\n\nMany NGOs are calling for regulation of AI systems. But the companies selling these systems are pushing back on regulation, under the guise of innovation. At the same time, regulators are struggling to articulate what regulation should be applied to: the AI systems, the data sets, their combined impact? Should we repurpose existing legislation or develop novel approaches? What about the gap between regulation development and implementation? We have the GDPR and yet I still get spam. This is not to say we shouldn't pursue regulation; it is to say that the discussion needs to include effective implementation too. These are the often dull but necessary bits of work many NGOs are focused on.  \n\nAnd then there's the &quot;minor&quot; question of trusting regulators to be able to understand what is, and what isn't good use of it. Or even to trust them to have the best interests of people in mind in the first place. Not a given.\n\nI know people have been talking about making sure that the data sets are polished in a way to be more representative of society, or that they include more diversity. But that means we are still moving towards societies in which, some academics like Os Keyes, Kate Crawford and Alondra Nelson argue, we follow the questionable logic that more countable = good. Or that seen by the state = equality before the law. Multiple academics have argued that inclusion in a database does not mean equitable treatment by the state. Hence, there are plenty of examples which suggest bias in AI systems cannot be resolved through expansive inclusion of minorities in datasets.\n\n### It's not just America\n\nIt is easy to dismiss these concerns as distinctly American. But, let's keep in mind that Europe is not the be-all-end-all of good technology regulation. As much as we have good policies, we also have terrible policies, like the upload filters or the Google \u201cright-to-be-forgotten\u201d. Those are not a good examples of what solid tech-policy looks, at least not to many of the NGOs I work with. So, instead of saying, we have a responsibility to use our EU regulatory blueprint and impose that on other places \u2014 as is often said \u2014 we should be humble. Because we, as Europeans, would be incredibly resistant to the inverse of that. Actually, we are incredibly resistant to it. As can be seen in how we respond to the enforcement of the American blue-print of freedom of expression and (lack of regulation of) hate speech forced upon those by the ubiquity of American Internet companies.\n\nAs such, when it comes to exporting our approach, I would be more inclined to say, let's provide an alternative example. Let's just say &amp;ldquo;this is how we make the balance between these different values.&amp;rdquo; And what we&amp;rsquo;ve seen, for instance, with the GDPR, is that that did kick off a bit of a trend across the world where people are using it to model their data and privacy regulations on. And I think that sort of leading by example, is a much more effective. Anything short of that can be seen as imposing our way onto the world, which considering Europe's colonial history is not a strong look.\n\n\n### Regulation, Civil Society, and Limits\n\nSome companies argue that regulation hampers innovation, while at the same time arguing that real innovation is not impacted by regulations. So like, bro.. which way is it? Does it matter immensely, or does it not matter at all? Because it certainly can't be both at the same time. I am not trying to be facetious here, just trying to tease out the contradictions in Silicon Valley rhetoric about tech-regulation. Doing so - allows for a real discussion to take place. Okay, you believe in innovation. Great. But what does that term mean to you? But if innovation to you means \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d or \u201cdisrupt existing industries\u201d (with little regard for the long-term consequences) than don\u2019t be surprised if people outside of industry are not going to be on board or impressed.\n\n\n### Case in point: Data & the Status quo\n\nDatabases are, by and large, systems reflective of our bias. That's also what the academic research shows. It suggests that whenever presented with an AI or automated or machine learning or whatever the term-du-jour is, you always need to look for the humans. We tend to think of these systems as being without humans, all automated. But often they are not. Academic like Sarah Roberts, Mary Gray and Siddharth Suri have shown the human face of AI systems. And the same applies to the algorithms that are applied to the data: humans make a particular decision about how to weigh bits, and which part of it. Often, as Seda Gurses, has shown this is done to optimize towards metrics that are in the interest of the company rather than the consumer.\n\nPeople are fast to judge technology critics as Luddites. There are undoubtably useful applications of AI systems. But those are only going to arise if the right regulatory and economic context is in place. I mean, I'm very wary of moving towards a world in which we say &amp;ldquo;these technologies are completely free of humans are completely free of bias, and hence, they are more trustworthy than us.&amp;rdquo; Because there is no such technology, as technology is always the product of humans. And I think it is important not to lose sight of that.\n\nHow can we develop other ways that we can ensure that there is a better understanding of how these technologies work? There are a lot of interesting research of academics who do really good work specifically in that field. I mentioned some above. I think it shows that we should not buy into the hype: that it so incredibly complicated that we could never potentially figure out how it works. AI is often a word for a system that learns recursively based on large data sets using complex statistics. It is not, as academics like MC Elish and danah boyd have argued, magic. Let's just call it call it for what it is, call a spade a spade. The problem is that there is not a lot of either political or economic interest in doing so.\n\nLikewise, let\u2019s be aware of what a drive for \u201cinnovation\u201d does. Because this is what concerns me. I've [written about it with Roel Dobbe](https://www.volkskrant.nl/columns-opinie/verwacht-geen-wonderen-van-artificiele-intelligentie~b226bfac/?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) who is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the AI Now Institute at NYU. Our government (The Netherlands) in particular, but others as well, have this sort of irrational fear of being seen as falling behind on technology and technological developments. So they're like, &amp;ldquo;Oh, we must we must apply the AI in the cloud using IoT.&amp;rdquo; What does that even mean? When cities want to put things on blockchain, they should ask themselves if they need anything more than a spreadsheet? Why would you want to have an immutable spreadsheet spread out over multiple computers, for whatever simple thing you're trying to do to attract tourists? I get it, it sounds cool. But that's also my tax money that's being used to work with technology that I don't think is useful, and that I'd rather see you put into education, or health care or anywhere else where we could improve rather than disrupt. In addition to the fact that you have these sort of perverse economic incentives on the part of the company's not to reveal how their systems work, there's also this innovation myth which encourages governments to take steps to include technologies that they don't fully understand or might not even need.\n\n\n\n### AI Systems are Dull and Humans are Inconsistent (luckily)\n\nI also have a pet-peeve about the dullness of these systems as they are commonly applied. The logic of these AI systems is that they give you recommendations based on your past behavior. But humans change. Please don&amp;rsquo;t give me fashion advice based on what I would have liked at 16. I have evolved, thank God. Yesterday, my husband was sitting at the dining table, looking at Amazon trying to buy something. And he was like, &amp;ldquo;this stupid website, keeps recommending me socks.&amp;rdquo; Because he bought socks once. &amp;ldquo;I don't need more socks!&amp;rdquo; he said. The logic behind it is, &amp;ldquo;Oh, you like this thing. And hence, you must like more of this thing,&amp;rdquo; right. But for some of these things, you don't need more than one, such as an electric toothbrush, I don't need five of them in different colors. I need one. Right?\n\nSometimes it does work a little bit better. I find it really useful with academic books. I look for a particular book, and it says people like you, or people who've bought this book, also liked this book.&amp;rdquo; I've actually found books that I had not yet come across. But then again, for instance, for music, is a good example of how these systems are simply to flat for human needs. Because as soon as you have a little bit of an eclectic taste in music \u2014 one day you listen to Rihanna, and the next day you listen to Mozart \u2014 with the recommendations there is no in-between. And so you either get a lot of the same of one thing, or a lot of the same of another thing, but it doesn't actually capture the nuance of human taste.\n\nAnd I think that is one of the problems with the systems in general, they don't get they don't capture the nuance of the complexity of human life.\n\n\n### Local Knowledge first\n\nWhat should we do? What is the role of academics and human rights activist in Europe, given these various complications I laid out? I've worked with a number of NGOs on security methods and I worked with their safety teams. When I was living in Brazil, I worked with an NGO that specifically focused on digital security trainings for human rights activists. On the one hand, they have limited capacity to engage with all of the latest and greatest technological developments. On the other hand, they have a lot of incredibly local knowledge we tend to not think about naturally, because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t come up in our context.\n\nA great example is a friend who's a very well-known activist. He knows that the police are monitoring him, that he's under surveillance, and so are his family and friends. And so one of the things that we did is setting up this elaborate encrypted emailing service for him, explained VPNs, and helped him use signal. And then one morning, he came in, and he said, you know, this is all incredibly great. I now have all of these encrypted services. But you know, what happened this morning. I was sitting on my motorcycle, texting someone, a police officer walked up to me, and just grabbed the phone out of my hand.&amp;rdquo; Which meant that it was open, which meant that no matter the encrypted services, no matter the signal, no matter the VPN, they had access to his phone. We didn\u2019t discuss this scenario because for most of the trainers, it simply hadn\u2019t occurred to them that this might be how the police would act.\n\nI have seen the tendency of European trainers who go abroad with their really elaborate technologies for improving your safety. But they don't actually address what a security risk looks like on the ground. So, I think one of the things that I would be really interested in, is actually trying to figure out whether a training on IoT is useful, and perhaps look at physical safety. Working with a philosophy where the starting point is: you know a lot about the problems that you have, so explain to us what your problems are, and then collaboratively, we can bring together a bunch of different resources to figure out what a solution should look like. Instead of sharing the technical knowledge that we have, pouring it out and then leaving. Not that everyone does that. But I do think that it is an easy mistake to make, an easy trap to fall into.\n\n\n### A Human Centered Internet\n\nSetting a good example in terms of legislation is a start. And not falling into easy-finger pointing towards obvious scapegoats (i.e. well but in name-country-X everything is so much worse). There are lot issues we could work on in Europe to improve how the internet is used, and the extent to which it enables or disables certain civil liberties.\n\nThe UK is a prime example, using the internet infrastructure for things that it wasn't built for. So, I think one of the things we can do in Europe is be a little bit less on our high horses, because we don't always get it right. We should try to figure out that if we want to have an internet of humans, and if we want to think about a European Framework, how can we make sure we do that? Putting our values first.\n\n\n### What's next: AI regulation?\n\nI would love to say that it's enough to just regulate these companies. And to a certain extent, you can do that. For example, Nazi content in in in Germany isn't accessible. That's a regulation. It's not about what Google stands for. But it's simply what the country has said. So, there is a regulatory component to where you say simply, technically, we don't want this to be accessible. This happens all the time. And that's part of the friction which you see now with the right to be forgotten.\n\nThere's been a lot of talk about companies developing voluntary ethical frameworks for AI governance. I think this is a good first step, I always think it's good for companies to be explicit about their values and what they stand for, and what they find acceptable and what they don't. That being said, a lot of the recent literature actually shows that these ethical frameworks are always going to be articulated within the bones of the business logic, which means it's never going to be radical, which means it's never going to be anything that chips away at late stage capitalism.\n\nSo, then the question becomes &amp;ldquo;how can you make it hurt?&amp;rdquo; Financially? I honestly think, and again, I might be too jaded here, that if the companies don\u2019t hurt financially, they won't change. And in addition, I think there's also the question of trust, that can be leveraged in this particular case. AI technologies have run into the same problem that we've seen with biotechnology. And that is that the public is worried about it, scared about it. The kind of narratives about our AI overlords, which, you know, generally is not something that I believe in or support. But it does mean that these companies need to work harder to get the public to buy their stuff. So, we need to find a way to make sure that we leverage those two things, a lack of trust in this product, as well as making sure that it financially hurts businesses not to comply with whatever regulations we set up, or whatever values we hold dear.\n\nThe question, however, becomes: what are the guidelines and what are the values? I think there's justifiably been a lot of pushback on for instance, the guidelines that were developed by the high-level group of experts on AI. So, the question is: where does corporate capture happen? Because if for instance, like with those guidelines is not half as efficient as you would like it to be. That is why I do think corporate capture is a huge issue. And a meta concern we need to think about. And at the same time, while it is convenient to assume that Europeans have a shared set of values enshrined in national and European documents the current rise of populism and xenophobia paints a much less convenient picture. How do you make sure \u2013 in the face of so much societal unrest \u2013 to uphold some primary principles?\n\n**Burning Question:** What does the future of civil society advocacy look like, given the prevalence of these digital technologies and their impact on the work that civil society is currently doing?\n\n## Post a thoughtful comment below ahead of the **[workshop on AI &amp; Justice ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them-19-11-brussels/10326)**  on November 19!\nThis will help us to prepare good case studies for exploring these topics in detail.

It's looking more and more that it will be a tool shared by several organisations in biomaterials. The topic are biomaterials and biofabrication. Air quality or water quality or other scientific subjects other than biomaterials / biofabrication are a little outside the scope. They are welcome, but on the sidelines.\n\n**Magma Nova**: cooperative in biomaterials & biofabrication. We make products and we do education. The BioFab Forum is an educational tool, that we share with the global community. We see the forum as bringing two innovations: open online communities for science/design education, and open online communities for citizen science. But it is no more than a tool. We did not want to brand the forum as \"Magma Nova forum\" or whatever, since it goes beyond only Magma Nova. A gift and an investment for the open source biomaterial field.\n\n**ReaGent**: the organisation that stewards the open biolab in Ghent and legally a nonprofit. Lots of what Magma Nova does, goes down in the lab, and there are other organisations also sharing the lab. In ReaGent we have a team experienced in citizen science, communication, education etc. that spans every field of science. It is as ReaGent that we get asked to facilitate citizen science now and again, or where we look for opportunities ourselves. We have good boots on the ground skills, but also strategic insights. The former we would do only locally, the latter we can share globally.\n\nSo I would scratch BioFab Forum from any texts related to this proposal. Of course we can discuss using it as a tool, but I would do that at a later stage, and keep it at \"an online platform\" for now. It's already hard enough to get it working well without an additional project relying on it.\n\nWe are doing the same as you are @alberto , for the biomaterial community, as we speak. And try to give back to Edgeryders as well, eg. with the forum mission. It's small things for now, but we are still small. For the forum, at least we can give back in  kind under the form of advice about how you could scale up this forum prototype with us into a business model. \n\nFor the proposal, strategically or intellectually I would like to be personally part of it, since it's right up my alley. It builds on thinking that I've been part of for a long time now, has shaped how we operate and where I feel like we can push the possibilities further. \n\nPractically, ReaGent can do facilitation in Belgium (or even more local), but I would prefer if budget for doing actual citizen science is distributed to orgs like Hackuarium (@rachel ) , Science Hack Day Berlin (@lucy )  and the likes.

I work for a company or a local government organization called Meath Enterprise which owns a number of facilities and co working spaces of approximately 85,000 square foot in one major town. It's a very large community hub that's very embedded in the community, dealing with and supporting community groups and social enterprises in a big way as well, and local employment. \n\nOur Kells tech hub is slightly smaller, with more of a focus on technology, where we run training programs and acceleration programs to support companies and lots of events. We don't have a major university or a college directly in our region, but we do plenty surrounding them because we're very, very close to government. We build these facilities to use as an outreach for colleges to be able to come and engage with companies on site and vice versa, from commercializing research opportunities to ideas with universities. \n\nWe are building a new state of the art smart agri hub as part of the European-wide project on digital innovation hubs and that's a new 30,000 square foot builds in Navan and we're developing some new remote working hubs. Hopefully by q4 2020, we'll have specifically dedicated co working spaces smaller, maybe 20 to 30 desks in different parts of the region. And we're talking to private developers about potential partnerships where we can work alongside private developers potentially, to see how we can facilitate developing new spaces that people can engage with locally and then feed into the larger hubs and the larger networks. \n\nIn a voluntary capacity, I'm part of a larger association called the National Association of Community Enterprise Centers in Ireland, community leaders, Enterprise Center managers, college incubators, local government-owned incubators, private owned incubators, some charity some not for profits. NACEC is the umbrella organization that tries to oversee and coordinate where possible. We've developed a whole new strategy and strategic plan for the next few years, which is now government funded, to build a proper structure in terms of quality standards for the network, in terms of the facilities themselves, and the services that we can provide to our tenants and to the wider region, how we can connect companies with other ecosystems in other regions or other countries. \n\nThe bulk of my work through COVID, as you can probably imagine, has been on the NACEC side, shutting down or closing or limiting what we do locally. On a national level, the challenges facing different hubs as a result of COVID, and thus their attendance and our clients and our projects has been fairly immense. We're in the process of developing a national action and recovery plan in partnership with government and major agencies to help address a lot of these challenges presented by COVID. Short term, that\u2019s reconfiguring spaces and bringing in new technology into hubs to support hubs and support our clients but also then the medium to longer term opportunities in terms of future work, flexible work in blended working, remote working. \n\nWe developed a new strategic plan for NACEC and launched that with the ministers as part of the OECD's launch of the SME and entrepreneurship policy reports back in October 2019. COVID has certainly accelerated the need for quality standards, accelerated the need for technology, adoption and digitization of these hubs and how they operate. \n\nIn terms of climate change and other things. COVID has just presented these opportunities to all of us, in terms of regional development or community enterprise development across the country, and black spots for employment. We can work with these remote workers, bringing them into local community hubs and try and drive activity back into communities where people not just work in local hubs and interact, engage and help one another. It provides a solution not just for work life balance and everything else community development, but also potentially the environment. \n\nOur local hubs in County Meath were quite more old fashioned and own-door access and co working and large tenants and lots of events, but over the past couple of years, we put in a lot of technology. On the other hand, we can manage the Kells tech hub remotely from our phones. Having that technology in Kells helped because our centers never shut down completely. \n\nLike everybody else in the world, we're Zoomed out, and we're on Microsoft Teams and Zoom every day, and we're running events and webinars like everybody else, more than we ever did. Personally, I think face to face interaction is great for creativity and innovation, so finding a blended approach to kind of online and offline in terms of how we train, how we network, interact or run our events is certainly focus going forward. \n\nMighty Networks is a closed network platform that we can invite people to, like a social media platform, where people interact, call, message, on app on their phone. So you get notifications like you would on LinkedIn, or Facebook, and they share content, and we can put up templates and lots of information to help other centers. It's been an amazing communication tool, actually, during the crisis. It\u2019s like a social media ongoing conversation that just evolves and happens every single day. \n\nAnother thing Mighty Networks allows (and we haven't gone there yet) is the ability to run training programs through webinar or various technologies that they use and monetize that training. The training element and the events side of Mighty Networks is what we're really interested in in the future. \n\nThe problem with NACEC was that as a national body or a national association that was not reflected at a national level. So a lot of that grace, technology and information and learning wasn't being transferred in a balanced or structured way across the entire network. The purpose of the strategy was really to try and fix that and create a national body that could be a professional association, a legal entity, with a strong budget and a full time team, which we will have in the coming months. \n\nEveryone is embracing technology such as Zoom now out of necessity. A lot of us are not remote working by choice, preferring the structure of office work, or not having access to quality broadband or the children in the house. But now people that have never done online meetings or use Skype, all of a sudden they're totally interacting and loving the technology and actually enjoying working remotely. If they're at home, it's the isolation and it's everything else that becomes an issue if it's for too long. And that's where the blended approach comes in. \n\nWe have local tenants in our Navan hub that do a lot of woodworking type, artisan woodwork, kind of very bespoke products with wood, and they have CNC machinery and we needed perspex screens. We used them to make all these screens for our desks and in between our meeting tables and everything else. So we use some of our local companies to create products and everything that could make our home safer. \n\nWe're looking at various types of technologies in Kells that we can add to what we already have. A lot of people through the pandemic are realizing they can actually work remotely, but maybe broadband is an issue, or isolation or maybe they want to interact with people in a blended approach. So we've looked at the possibility of working with some partners to create small hubs that will accommodate 15 or 20 desks initially with social distancing guidelines in place. As those guidelines ease, we may be able to accommodate more desks, and we'll need to have cameras so that we can monitor and control and keep everybody safe. But certainly, the appetite for this type of a service seems to be there. \n\nBut how do we create platforms in the cloud, where people then within these hubs can interact and engage? We're going to look at engaging with a couple of startup companies that have come to work our region to see how can we make the co working experience more seamless, but online and in the cloud. So whether they go to the home office or stay at home, it looks the same because all their interaction, all their information is in the cloud. \n\nWe work very closely with Maynooth University as well as the Dublin colleges, taking graduates and interns, and we would have students working on different projects for companies. We will put together a cluster of companies on a particular project, and bring cPhDs or students or graduates in to work on these projects with those companies, which is great for the colleges, because it gives that hands on experience for a lot of their students. We take year four students or higher so that they can add real value to the company and it doesn't waste anybody's time. \n\nAs we build our clusters and our innovation districts, the universities would have their own onsite incubators, and a lot of those would be members of NACEC. The challenge of educating, training and developing that mix of hubs and incubators is quite big, but when spoke to MIT to find out if there was a quality standards framework anywhere in the world for incubators and enterprise hubs, they weren't aware of them. \n\nSo we're looking at developing a quality standards framework where we can measure activity and measure progress with our local Quality Standards Association, who represent ISO in Ireland. There will be a certain level of training and understanding you need to get to that to get that quality stamp, and that approval mark. Our quality standards framework will need to deal with all of these issues of digitization and climate change because that is at the very very heart of how co working or incubation or acceleration is going to drive community or regional development in any way, shape or form, in a structured and sustainable and balanced way in the future. \n\nImmediately the biggest challenges are financial resources. 33% have tenants have gone out of business permanently. For the tenants that are left or new tenants, it is important that we have capability for people to work virtually, or meet or train or interact kind of virtually or online. So the big challenge for hubs for the entire sector at the minute is in terms of embracing potentially new technology or is open and stay alive, stay relevant, and make sure that they can support their tenants who can't afford to pay rent, or adapt what they're doing or are in the process of trying to do that and just need more time. Hubs need to carry that weight, even if they can't pay. \n\nThe reason we conducted this national survey of the impact COVID has had on the national hub sector was to assess those major financial challenges that these hubs are experiencing and try and put a proposal to government to put some sort of a grand scheme or funding mechanism in place to support these hubs keeping the doors open reconfiguring their spaces, creating additional spaces to accommodate the new remote workers or co workers that may need to use the facilities in the future and helping existing companies and startups survive the next few months, so that they're still there in the future. Hubs certainly cannot carry that weight on their own. There will need to be government intervention of some sort. \n\nWe're developing a new action plan that accelerates a lot of what's in that strategic plan, but adapts it and tailors it to fit the current environment. We've probably seen three years worth of movement in terms of digitizing hubs in the space of three months. If there is an appetite by governments and the larger corporates and the larger multinationals to try and make sure we stay on this road in some way, shape, or form, I think that will help hubs. The quality standards framework then becomes a mechanism for measuring and building and driving that kind of regional development piece into the future, which is going to benefit everybody and makes it easier for government to allocate resources and funding in different parts of the country or to different sectors. In the past, we've probably been more disconnected than connected. And I think COVID has helped connect an awful lot of us together much more. And technology can help.\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n![37bc7a02ea7da6c5578c05f5ec5daaf8051be294_2_1380x776|690x388](upload://sWERRANdZc0cFVUI7ea9sTuu3Q4.jpeg) \n*Meet Gary at our event on 21/7.

I suppose that there are other models of the business cycle.\n[/quote]\n\n\nNoted and corrected.\n\n[quote=\"mstn, post:2, topic:11504\"]\nWhat do you mean with \u201cpreference\u201d?\n[/quote]\n\nConsumer preferences. In a super famous 1930 paper, \"Economic possibilities for our grandchildren\", Keynes predicted that the exponential dynamics of capital accumulation would soon increase productivity of labor enough to satisfy all needs, and shorten the working week to one or two days. And indeed all needs, as viewed by a worker in 1930, have been satisfied. What Keynes did not predict is that new needs would arise, that would have seemed extravagant to that 1930 workers: smartphones, Netflix subscriptions, holidays to Ibiza, pets hairdressers etc. \n\nNeoclassical economists, correctly recognizing that needs are subjective, dropped the language of \"needs\" altogether, and substituted them with that of \"preferences\". Standard theory assumes that preferences are exogenous to the models: in other words, people have preferences that are formed *outside* of economic activities. In practice, this is not true (the whole marketing profession is about inventing new needs), but models with endogenous preferences are much harder to solve mathematically. However, if we abandon the idea of \"solving\" a model and instead just run it, we can deal with more complexities and feedback. \n\nWhy I think this is important: because I am dissatisfied with this nonsense about \"growth\". Growth of what? Ecological economists say that infinite growth is impossible, but they have in mind a growth in material resources consumption, not one in human happiness. If your value theory is based on happiness, you can in theory have increasing happiness with decreasing consumption of material resources: for example, instead of flying to the Maldives for your holidays, you move there forever. \n\nAt the same time, it is clear that individual preferences emerge in the context of economic and social relationships. I would like to think about how to build an instructive simulation of a macro world where preferences might shift from more to less materialistic, and see if we can learn something.", "created_at": "2019-11-12 20:40:25.873515", "updated_at": "2019-11-12 21:59:08.856553", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 371, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 50.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [63931], "is_reply_to": [63931], "is_liked_by": [1514, 5698], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48249, "user_id": 4691, "topic_id": 9136, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Thank you so much for the tips and the information Wael, I will make sure to look into them and visit as many as possible!", "created_at": "2018-11-02 15:10:21.158928", "updated_at": "2018-11-02 15:10:21.158928", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 21.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [48217], "is_liked_by": [4265], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66352, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 11380, "post_number": 6, "raw": "[quote=\"hugi, post:3, topic:11380\"]Maybe it\u2019s running out of memory[/quote]\n\nThere's 8 GiB of free main memory around now.

We encountered some individual investors, if we balance the social impact and the revenue, we have the gap where larger companies / technical industries invest the same and get larger revenue.\"\n\n**Rebeka:** Investors are traditionally more interested in Return on Investments than social impact; one of the good things is that, slowly, there\u2019s this awakening awareness and there are social impact funds that are emerging.\n\nThere are not a lot of them, and they are not always accessible, that\u2019s why we need to look at other sources at the beginning stages (before you have proven that you are making money)\n\nBefore you consider who you are going to approach as potential donor or funding partner, you need to think about your fundraising strategy\n\n![|602x312](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/j2AuyYmB9abY5t67HVGDpxAl9cmocOuPA5oaje5Vhl0jULh2hrREuhkxpd4FY23ZB36fraDBq9Q0DEvO0PrTbqsGJkxgwCdhs-k8oQXH90qkjfe9foylK0hbNpxr3bUE5ZJaAdII)\n\nAt first, you need to work internally and to have a clear vision where you project is evolving to (what is your project, who is your target, which direction you want to grow). you will have your project timeline, what idea you will be testing, who you need to approach, where do you need injection of cash, your funding needs etc..\n\nThen you can set a clear fundraising strategy.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified all of your funding needs, you will need to prioritize.\n\nthe next step is to think of the means you will be using to present your project to investors and donors.\n\nBasically you will have to explain the project, present the entrepreneurs, etc. but you will need also to back it up with actual data that will make people believe in your project more.\n\nThen, you\u2019ll have to thinks of types of donors you need to approach; here you need to be selective, because you don\u2019t want to end up partner with donors who do not share your vision, who have very different goals. For that, do your research, target people and understand them.\n\nwhile fundraising, do not forget to reach a level of self sustainability so that you can keep going regardless the external environment.\n\nchoosing the type of funding partners for you:\n\nThis depends on:\n\n* the development stage of your project\n\n* the amounts you need to raise (small, large, \u2026)\n\n* what kind of support you are looking for\n\n![|602x307](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Hsx9Uc0t7NASzt2t8AddQRPSIZzDD-2KyK2JohUvQMb791wcfhsRX_tA5Qccxp9xuv_8ZPuTilkrQqydjNBxSNdECKrArsjPkx9MsiZSIBp6CB5qAdHhGi-1SfMlIJQHLfG2HwPg)\n\nTo wrap up the first section, the mentor proposed an exercise and a Q/A session.\n\n**Exercise 1 (send your answers on a word document to [open.cilab@gmail.com](mailto:open.cilab@gmail.com) )**\n\n**What are my fundraising needs for the:**\n\n**a) short-term**\n\n**b) Mid-term**\n\n**c) Long-term Can I prioritise?**\n\n**What are related milestones (in terms of $ and/or impact)?**\n\n**What kind of partner is best for my needs?**\n\n**Do I understand the needs and vision of each of my partners?**\n\n**Would you invest/support?**\n\n**What is different about your SE?**\n\n\nQuestions from the attendees:\n\n**Q1:** Moussa: \"You talked about social impact but not environmental impact?\"\n\n**A:** I am using \u201csocial impact\u201d as an umbrella term for social and environmental impact.\n\n**Q2:** @ayari.taha \"Embassies give grants to NGOs and associations not startups and social entrepreneurs, do you have ideas where we can find grants.\"\n\n**A:** There are certain ones that gives to social entreprises, USAID, Tunisia Jobs program, GIZ, tfannen, \u2026 look at this [link](https://www.globalinnovationexchange.org/) you can find certain programs that you can apply as a business.\n\n**Q3**: @HadeerGhareeb : \"Are there entities that provide fund that lasts all over the year (without calls)\"\n**A**: it depends on the institutions;\n\n**Q4:** how do I know if their vision is aligned to mine? if I am going to approach the embassy, who do I need to approach exactly?\n\n**A:** first thing you can look at their websites you will find what objectives they are already working on in your country.\nAs per who to contact, it depends from embassy to embassy. you have to contact the person of the cooperation development. You can always contact and ask to be referred to the right person.\n\n**Q5**: Moussa: when dealing with fundraising and partnership you have to prepare a proposal, yet when it comes to mailing, the problem is that they don\u2019t see the value of your startup; what do you thing the best approach in this case\n\n**A:** have you tried approaching people? it depends on how the application was prepared, did you response to what they are looking for, maybe they have certain other priorities, the process, the criteria\u2026 we can see this after the next section (TOC)\n\n**Q6:** Mohamed Taoufik Tekaya: Are the right of access to these programs for natural and / or legal persons ?\n\n**A:** these requirements depends from the calls, but you need to have a legal institution; it should be either a social enterprise or NGO; with competitions and other things you can have an idea with no legal entity\n\n**Q7:** @salaheddine: In Tunisia, there are restrictions regarding having funds from international organisations; is there other requirement like legal entity to get funds from outside the country.\n\n**A:** These funds and donors, if they are offering grants within Tunisia, they\u2019ve overcome these administrative hurdles.\n\n**after a 5 minutes break, the mentor started the second part of the online lab during which she will be holding discussions about the Theory of Change and the basic elements of a proposal.**\n\nProposal writing is a process that requires time, so when writing a proposal:\n\n* take your time to elaborate a perfect proposal\n* work with your team\n* make sure it\u2019s understandable, coherent and that \u201cthe language is good\u201d\n\n**What is ToC?**\n\nToC is a useful tool to layout the steps that show how your project is going to lead to the social/environmental impact.\n\nToC is used to present the impact of your SE (not the profit).\n\nWhen you are presenting your project and the impact you want to have, the starting point you need to go from is: \u201cWhat is the problem that I am trying to address?\u201d and then you need to dig deeper to the \u201cwhy\u201d to identify the root cause of the cause.\n\nThrough analyzing the problems and the root causes you provide the context.\n\n![|602x227](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ILGTtuJiHAe7PABRrGCMnojsJTrgDRJEYWrxIohsEetW05SseVlOlI4himBg1nmSWQCYqABx9J9KXQg71KHoOlHQbfU3a3KOc3ch1sxjXYjPP9Oondce5yqe2Ad8hSNyttoT2DbG)\n\nYou need to answer the up-mentioned questions before starting to design your ToC.\n\n**The Path of change**\n\n\nThe illustration below is the elements of ToC, as your roadmap from your action to the desired social impact.\n\n![|501x542](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AKY0IDSGa27ypnOc8kuauAw2P2DxfhzJHxZBxByOxdAwNZcZ_D833bPJERErxv02bvzUw8efyaBLGhec9NGGrit07nSB9A9n7XAnff9zZy-B9MmKHOyPlNV0SAsvn-n8z2XjAVaf)\n\n* Once you answer the questions, you start to identify your activities and actions.\n\n* Before putting your activities into place, you will need to know what resources you will need for that (team members, funds, machines, etc.)\n\n* As a direct result of the activities, you will have the outputs (products, etc.) (short-term objective)\n\n* The outcomes are the results of the outputs.

You need to question your own assumptions.\nTo measure the impact you can use qualitative or quantitative indicators.\nQuantitative Indicators are generally easier to use.\nThe qualitative side is for example the satisfaction of this online lab's participants on the content; which can be measured through feedback forms.\n\n**Proposal writing**\n\nGenerally donors have formats and templates that they will ask you to fill to apply.\nThe basic elements of a proposal / concept note are: \n\n![image|690x367](upload://3fz3N1leieQoWUmsX1wUOcn0yw9.png) \ngoing from this list, you can prepare your own proposal template that you can adapt whenever you have a new call to apply on.\n\n\n**Q & A:**\n**Q:** Amir: does the less we demand for budget the more we have chance to have it?\n**A:** No, not necessarily. In the call for applications they generally mention the budget limits.\nIf you are approaching a donor without a call, try to ask them about the budget limit and restrictions.\n**Q:** Moussa: What about Profitability?\n**A:** : it's related to your financial sustainability. Profitability when you are reaching a donor is different that when you are reaching an investor.\nThe donors are not getting their funds back, they are giving you the grant because they see that your project is going to have an impact.\n\n**Q:** Dorra: What about scalability?\n**A:** This depends on the donors, some of them require scalability in the sens of speading the impact.\n\n**Q:** Marwene: What are the most common mistakes when asking for funding?\n**A:** First, people over promise what they are going to deliver; so be very aware of promises in terms of impact. Second, be clear and strategic about what you want to do exactly. Third, people are not really responding to the need of their targeted beneficiaries.\n\nat last, Rebeka shared the second exercise (offline task)\n![image|690x391](upload://yTjhwl3lc4fsGrrfT0D0PG68RRC.png) \n (send your answers on a word document to [open.cilab@gmail.com](mailto:open.cilab@gmail.com) )\n\nThank you all for taking part of the online lab. \nfind here the presentation: [Fundraising for SEs - Rebeka Gluhbegovic.pdf|attachment](upload://3yCdf76nFjCCSwbTaTM85PmAqvS.pdf) (1.1 MB)\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n## About our mentor: \n<br>\n\n\n![|602x449](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/E6UKsV3A1gghBttnoF4yIjF1GccfmmN95JdrBQyw7D60xnjoCoAt04rI6AyU6IntLu2IhwBzHvNeJxSc4HMEV3n6HwnPsK8_-HZ8lxPyYRi69i-aZtx3LjbC3TbunSM4WrJJQuol)", "created_at": "2020-03-31 17:04:57.878280", "updated_at": "2020-07-20 19:42:18.531520", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2018, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 222.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3782, 3703], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66639, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 11914, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Zdravo @Indjijativa!

One concerns their rather conflicted CEO, Jack Dorsey and the other about how Twitter has effectively banned tweets about ISIS but allows white supremacists to do their thing more freely.  In the Dorsey piece, he seems to be unable to get any real grip on what they should and should not allow, as if the whole thing ran away from him and his group long ago.  Which in a sense it has, especially because its chief loyalty is to keeping its stock price up.  In the other, it seems that the company would rather ban some Muslims unfairly so they can get rid of ISIS, but not run the risk of banning high-profile conservative (in the USA meaning Republicans) officials.\n\nWhat does this have to do with ads?  Everything, because they need to do what they can to bring in as many eyeballs as possible, while maintaining some public impression of social responsibility.  Dorsey looks like he might crack.  Zuckerberg though seems to have no such qualms.\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/jack-dorseys-ted-interview-and-the-end-of-an-era\n\nhttps://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3xgq5/why-wont-twitter-treat-white-supremacy-like-isis-because-it-would-mean-banning-some-republican-politicians-too", "created_at": "2019-04-30 02:53:12.981703", "updated_at": "2019-04-30 02:53:12.981703", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 247, "wiki": false, "reads": 38, "score": 27.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4795], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65815, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 11924, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Thanks for the talk @croslund!\n\nI wanted to show you these grants you could apply for in the NGI ecosystem:\n\n[NGI Ledger](https://www.ngi.eu/about/ledger/) and [NGI Trust](https://www.ngi.eu/about/ngi-trust/ ), specifically.", "created_at": "2019-11-26 10:06:16.561670", "updated_at": "2019-11-26 10:06:16.561670", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 39, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88779, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 15043, "post_number": 11, "raw": "would you be up for testing the waters with Kelly?", "created_at": "2020-12-10 09:43:04.128694", "updated_at": "2020-12-10 09:43:04.128694", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 10, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [88733], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85190, "user_id": 6455, "topic_id": 14460, "post_number": 81, "raw": "Hi Ivan,\n\nSo, do you want a summary of what was discussed on that call for a post? \n\nWill you be uploading it to Descript?\n\nLaura", "created_at": "2020-10-16 13:02:02.643676", "updated_at": "2020-10-16 13:02:02.643676", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 26, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 1.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [84667], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 46964, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8972, "post_number": 14, "raw": "Noted.

Chris has had a pretty unconventional career path that takes in the UK Department of Trade and Industry; market regulation and development as a Director of the International Petroleum Exchange and then a Dot Com entrepreneur in the world of global markets. This path came to an abrupt end when he blew the whistle on oil market shenanigans and since then he has been researching more enlightened - peer-to-peer - approaches to the flawed system he had left.\n\n**Collecting business models**\nHe says he collects business models like some might collect butterflies. But unlike a butterfly collector - these aren\u2019t pinned down in glass cases. He\u2019s breathed life in to a number of them - prototyping enterprises where there were no existing examples. This has led to ventures as diverse as raising the local pub from the ashes, literally (The Star and Garter in Linlithgow) to producing a short film.\n\nHis prototyping of corporate forms and instruments adopts a fractal approach - one foot in the existing and one foot in the possible. He has discovered that complementary solutions may be found via an \u2018adjacent possible\u2019 through a process of testing agreements and structures. The word \u2018agreement\u2019 comes up a lot in Chris\u2019 chat. \n\nI was hearing, that to make it as a prized corporate structure in Chris\u2019 collection, it would need to be simple, flexible, have an element of being scalable without encountering conflicts of interest and be founded on agreements. And perhaps most prized of all - created a structural alignment of all interests.\n\n**Practical applications and prototyping**\nHe's tried a simple structure, an Unincorporated Association, based on a two-page governance document - this was instrumental in regenerating the much-loved local pub.\n\nHe appreciates the infinite flexibility of a Company Limited by Guarantee (CLG) for asset holding and use. But perhaps, if I understood correctly, it is a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) that possesses most of the sought-after characteristics for bringing people together to develop assets to be held in perpetuity and in common within a CLG. \n\nThe development structure he calls a 'Capital Partnership' produced a short film with a launch party in Soho, London from nothing but a concept, a willingness to work together and free capacity. All those involved were members; actors, directors, agreement writers. They weren\u2019t issued ownership shares of \u00a31.00. They received \u2018nths\u2019; that is a percentage of the future revenue of the film produced. \n\nThis offer wasn\u2019t so acceptable to suppliers of essential equipment such as cameras and lights. So the LLP needed cash. This is where the funding innovation came in. Two capital partners invested the \u00a330,000 in cash in return for an agreed percentage of the film's revenue _if there was any_.\n\n**Aligning interests of all stakeholders**\nCapital _partners_ do not participate in net profits after costs - they simply participate directly - as genuine partners -  in any gross revenue. I think the emphasis here is they were _participating_ - and it was in their interest to participate in ensuring the film was a success. All stakeholders interests were in alignment. This contrasts sharply with both bank debt and with typical venture capital which extracts profits - and where more often than not, it can be more in their interest to screw everyone in the pursuit of those profits. \n\nSo while the structure supported the film production, unfortunately this film didn\u2019t have a happy ending. The director (the founder and driving force) had a melt down and left for South Africa and the film was never marketed. But nobody got hurt. No employees got stuffed. Everyone went in to it with their eyes open. Film investors know they only make money on one-in-ten films and they had a genuine tax loss to ease the pain. The LLP hadn't contracted with anyone and didn't own anything - it was simply a framework or a wrapper that enabled people to come together for the common purpose of creating a potentially productive asset - in this case a film.  \n\nWhat works for a film would also work for developing or acquiring any type of productive asset - land, buildings, wind turbines and of particular relevant intellectual property such as that produced through Open Care. Its a financing structure that enables the creation of new flows of use value - whether that\u2019s care, rent, production, energy, pizza or beer. \n\nThen he pulled from the pocket of his jacket two sticks. \n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/89c3b82408ee3eb83c12dd829d6c1e3461d0ae07.jpg\" width=\"236\" height=\"300\">\n\nHe told me these were tally sticks - an accounting mechanism that pre-dated double entry bookkeeping. All those counter-intuitive credits and debits!\n\nHe said it was a way to record a transaction. \n\nNotches are cut in a stick, and a record made in writing to identify the people and what the notches represent. The stick is then cut into two, with one piece longer than the other. A transaction between two parties may be recorded by splitting this 'tally stick' into two - with one party retaining the long stick, and the other the short stick.\n\nHe told me they were used in two ways. The first was to record a PROOF of payment, also called a _memorandum tally_. This was like a receipt of past value transfer. The second was more interesting. The second was as a record of a PROMISE and was also called a _loan tally_ which enabled finance to be raised through the exchange of value now against a promise of provision of value later. Naturally this offer of credit required trust that the beneficiary would provide value in the future.\n\nApparently, these tally sticks were used by kings who always needed money (or money's worth of goods and services) before taxes or rents were due. The tally sticks enabled a funding mechanism by which rent or tax payers who had spare resources or had created some surplus could pre-pay their taxes - which of course they would only do if they received a discount. \n\nWhen the agreement to prepay taxes or rents was made the tax/rent payer received a loan tally as a record of the pre-payment . When the time came to pay his taxes or rent he then returned the tally stick promise to Exchequer where it was matched using the notches (and of course the grain of the wood) to the other half of the split tally stick. This cancelled the tax obligation and is the origin of the expression 'tax return' for our annual accounting with the tax man!\n\nThis return of promises also gave rise to the expression 'rate of return\u2019. This represents the rate over time at which the tokens or sticks could be returned to the promissor who issued them. In simple terms - you take the discount (or profit) and divide by time. There\u2019s no compound interest - there\u2019s simply a swap of money's worth going on. \n\n**Promises and agreements as a funding mechanism**\nSo how is this relevant to today? What\u2019s interesting is that anyone can issue these promises or credit instruments. They become a way of funding an asset or an enterprise. There is no permanent dividend. You could sell 5 years of future production, rent or revenues. Unlike interest on a loan, all/both parties share risk and reward. In a bad year the investor/s gets nothing but in a good year they'll do well too. What this opens up is a new funding option for anyone without the need for shares. It is simply pre-payment at a discount. \n\nChris was able to give a couple of good examples of places where this had worked in practice. He told me about a deli in NY State in the U.S. The owner wanted to borrow money for a new pizza oven but conventional forms of capital knocked him back. Then a customer offered to pay in advance for a pizza and this gave him an idea. He issued $10,000 of promises in exchange for $8,000 in cash - pre-payment at a discount - and these $1 Deli promises soon began to circulate as a form of currency which he called DeliDollars.\n\nSo it would seem that this suggests that we don\u2019t need money. We need an agreement (there\u2019s that word again) which in this case is some way of keeping score. Beyond that we simply need land or location, intellectual value (know-how, know-who) and design. And a will to work together.\n\n**Both Open and Closed**\nChris went on to explain the agreements we need are neither open or closed. Or perhaps they are _both_ open and closed. He said - as a model for sustaining operations - open doesn\u2019t work because anyone can take your work and quite simply you\u2019ll starve or at least you'll struggle to continue your work. Yet, the open source community is a response to 'closed' or proprietary models where value is extracted by rent-seekers aiming to screw as much as possible from all other stakeholders. Perhaps the ideal are forms or structures that are neither (or both) - like a club which may be both open and closed as dictated by club rules or agreements. Closed because only members may participate: but open because anyone who agrees to the club rules may join.\n\nClub rules begin with aims and extend to members, standards, dispute resolution and so on. But fundamentally a club is a two-way agreement, being interactive and participative so that interests become aligned.\n\nSo I could understand how this all worked when there was pizza involved - just! But I couldn\u2019t understand how this model was applicable to future, indirect benefits or outcomes - such as those that arise from social innovation or in the field of citizen science. In this example, Chris explained that the productive asset - which in the case of citizen science is IP - are held by all the stakeholders collectively with someone (typically a founder whose vision the IP was) designated as custodian of the ethics and aims.\n\nIn addition to the custodian, you have people with rights of use, people who invest in future rights of use and a trusted third party (someone who took care of any conflict resolution, and perhaps holds the money). This model can apply to land, energy and even IP like open source insulin. The rights to open source insulin would be held by a custodian in keeping with the values of open source but not necessarily \u2018open\u2019 to those who operate on exploitative practices. A platform cooperative agreement could then be set up to act as a framework for the creation and use of productive assets. Think of it like a platform for all the stakeholders.\n\nThere was a ton of other interesting stuff he said - like the business model created by James Watt. But my brain is still struggling to process this. So perhaps this is enough to chew on for now. \n\nI'd be interested to hear thoughts from others as to whether this has any interest in relation to the [Edge of Funding](http://edgeryders.eu/t/the-edge-of-funding-sustainability-and-financial-models/6427/4) session. @winnieponcelet @noemi  Seems it also may relate to the session proposal on [Ethics &amp; Data Protection](http://edgeryders.eu/t/session-proposal-ethics-and-data-protection-in-citizen-science-open-source-projects/6446/4) @markomanka @alberto \n\n----------\n\n\n\n_Chris is currently a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Security and Resilience Studies at University College London where his action-based research focuses on a new and complementary generation of networked markets and instruments.

I'm cross-posting it here from my blog - curious to hear your feedback!\n\nP.\n\n/// snip ///\n\n\n# Just enough City\n\nA little while ago, the ever-brilliant and eloquent [Rachel Coldicutt](https://twitter.com/rachelcoldicutt) wrote a piece on the role of public service internet, and why it should be a model of restraint. It\u2019s titled [Just enough Internet](https://www.doteveryone.org.uk/2019/10/just-enough-internet/), and it resonated deeply with me. It was her article that inspired not just this piece\u2019s title but also its theme: *Thank you, Rachel!*\n\nRachel argues that public service internet (broadcasters, government services) shouldn\u2019t compete with commercial competitors by commercial metrics, but rather use approaches better suited to their mandate: Not engagement and more data, but providing the important basics while collecting as little as possible. (This summary doesn\u2019t do Rachel\u2019s text justice, she makes more, and more nuanced points there, so please read her piece, it\u2019s time well spent.) \n\nThis restraint and reframing is important because it prevents mission creep; it also alleviates the carbon footprint of all those services.\n\n### Enter the Smart City\n\nWherever we look on the globe, we see so-called Smart City projects popping up. Some are incremental, and add just some sensors. Others are blank slate, building whole connected cities or neighborhoods from scratch. What they have in commons is that they mostly are built around a logic of data-driven management and optimization. *You can\u2019t manage what you can\u2019t measure*, management consultant Peter Drucker famously said, and so Smart Cities tend to measure\u2026 everything. Or so they try. \n\nOf course, sensors only measure so many things, like physical movement (of people, or goods, or vehicles) through space, or the consumption and creation of energy. But thriving urban life is made up of many more things, and many of those cannot be measured as easily: Try measuring opportunity or intention or quality of life, and most Smart City management dashboards will throw an error: *File not found.*\n\nThe narrative of the Smart City is based fundamentally that of optimizing a machine to run as efficiently as possible. It\u2019s neoliberal market thinking in its purest form. ([Greenfield](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18626431-against-the-smart-city) and [Townsend](https://wwnorton.com/books/Smart-Cities) and [Morozov](http://www.rosalux-nyc.org/rethinking-the-smart-city/) and many other Smart City critics have made those points much more eloquently before.) But that doesn\u2019t reflect urban life. The human side of it is missing, a glaring whole right in the center of that particular vision. \n\nInstead of putting citizens in that spot in the center, the \u201ctraditional\u201d Smart City model aims to build better (meaning: more efficient, lower cost) services to citizens by collecting, collating, analyzing data. It\u2019s the logic of global supply chains and predictive maintenance and telecommunications networks and data analytics applied to the public space. (It\u2019s no coincidence of the large tech vendors in that space come from either one of those backgrounds.) \n\nThe city, however, is no machine to be run at maximum efficiency. It\u2019s a messy agora, with competing and often conflicting interests, and it needs slack in the system: Slack and friction all increase resilience in the face of larger challenges, as do empowered citizens and municipal administrations. The last thing any city needs is to be fully algorithmically managed at maximum efficiency just to come to a grinding halt when \u2014 *not if!* \u2014 the first technical glitch happens, or some company ceases their business.\n\nMost importantly, I\u2019m convinced that collecting data in public space is a fundamental risk to a free society \u2014 and that it\u2019s made even worse if the data collection regime is outside of the public\u2019s control. \n\nThe option of anonymity plays a crucial role for the freedom of assembly, of organizing, of expressing thoughts and political speech. If sensitive data is collected in public space (even if it\u2019s not necessarily personably identifiable information!) then the trust in the collecting entity needs to be *absolute*. But as we know from political science, *the good king* is just another straw man, and that given the circumstance even the best government can turn bad quickly. History has taught us the crucial importance of checks & balances, and of data avoidance.\n\n### We need a Smart City model of restraint\n\nDiscussing publicly owned media, Rachel argues: \n\n> It\u2019s time to renegotiate the tacit agreement between the people, the market and the state to take account of the ways that data and technology have nudged behaviours and norms and changed the underlying infrastructure of everyday life. \n\nThis holds true for the (Smart) City, too: The tacit agreement between the people, the market and the state is that, roughly stated, the government provides essential services to its citizens, often with the help of the market, and with the citizens\u2019 interest at the core. However, when we see technology companies lobby governments to green-light data-collecting pilot projects with little accountability in public space, that tacit agreement is violated. Not the citizens\u2019 interests but those multinationals\u2019 business models move into the center of these considerations.\n\n**There is no opt-out in public space.** So when collecting meaningful consent to the collection of data about citizens is hard or impossible, that data must not be collected, period. Surveillance in public space is more often detrimental to free societies than not. *You know this! We all know this!*\n\nLess data collected, and more options of anonymity in public space, make for a more resilient public sphere. And what data is collected should be made available to the public at little or no cost, and to commercial interests only within a framework of ethical use (and probably for a fee).\n\n### What are better metrics for living in a (Smart) City?\n\nIn order to get to better Smart Cities, we need to think about better, more complete metrics than efficiency & cost savings, and we need to determine those (and all other big decisions about public space) through a strong commitment to participation: From external experts to citizens panels to digital participation platforms, there are many tools at our disposal to make better, more democratically legitimized decisions.\n\nIn that sense I cannot offer a final set of metrics to use. However, I can offer some potential starting points for a debate. I believe that every Smart City projects should be evaluated against the following aspects:\n- Would this substantially improve sustainability as laid out in the [UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SGD)](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html) framework?\n- Is meaningful participation built into the process at every step from framing to early feedback to planning to governance? Are the implications clear, and laid out in an accessibly, non-jargony way?\n- Are there safeguards in place to prevent things from getting worse than before if something doesn\u2019t work as planed?\n- Will it solve a real issue and improve the life of citizens? *If in doubt, cut it out.*\n- Will Participation, accountability, trust, resilience and security (T.R.U.S.T.) all improve through this project?\n\nObviously those can only be starting points. \n\nThe point I\u2019m making is this: **In the Smart City, less is more.**\n\nCity administrations should optimize for thriving urban live and democracy; for citizens and digital rights \u2014 which also happen to be human rights; for resilience and opportunity rather than efficiency. That way we can create a canvas to be painted by citizens, administration and \u2014 yes! \u2014 the market, too.\n\n*We can only manage what we can measure?* Not necessarily. Neither the population or the urban organism need to be managed; just given a robust framework to thrive within.

A lot of people in this community have been quite vocal about vouching for leisure as a value in and of itself, and especially in distinguishing \"doing the work\" (good) and \"having a job\" (meh). \n\nYou could tell your mother to read David Graeber's seminal *[Bullshit Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs)*. The intuition is that, with some exceptions (doctors are the most obvious one) our economy tends to underpay important work, that needs to be done for society to function properly (example: collective garbage). with respect to unimportant work, that could stop tomorrow with no consequences (or even positive consequences) for society (example: stock market traders).", "created_at": "2020-04-12 19:16:55.385551", "updated_at": "2020-04-18 12:48:46.797989", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 181, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 42.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [73542], "is_reply_to": [73542], "is_liked_by": [3, 428], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57962, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 10432, "post_number": 3, "raw": "@anon82932460 and @noemi - this is a social media-friendly summary of 5 texts, now good to go, with hashtags and all.", "created_at": "2019-08-14 15:37:47.270152", "updated_at": "2019-08-14 15:37:47.270152", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 21, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 64070, "user_id": 1514, "topic_id": 11504, "post_number": 6, "raw": "For reference, [here](https://observablehq.com/d/a7c814b919b321fb) the notebook with the model and my experiments at zero growth. Work in progress, it might have mistakes.\n\nI do not have a strong opinion about extending the model or starting from scratch. Just as a technical note: Goodwin kept the model simple to make it analytically solvable (I read). We do not have this constraint: we have cheaper computational power than in 1967. Perhaps, an extension at the cost of analytical solvability is a low hanging fruit.\n\nAnyway I agree to use it mainly as a source of inspiration. I believe that we should borrow (perhaps in a different form) social dynamics, tech progress and a way to represent the rate of profit.\n\nProbably, it is sustainable vs unsustainable more than material vs immaterial. Finance is immaterial but financial growth is not always good. On the other side, we need material output since we are not pure spirits (not yet, at least).\n\nIn the model, growth is production/output growth. In itself it is not a bad thing (it could be production of eco-happiness or immaterial bliss). Goodwin does not say anything about the nature of produced items in my opinion. His goal was to show how booms and crisis are endogenous in capitalism. **his model does not analyse an ecological problem, but a social one.** \n\nWhen scientists say that we should limit growth, they mean **resource wasting and polluting growth, bad growth.** \nOn the other side, in my opinion, the model shows that zero growth (regardless of the nature of produced widgets) is unhealthy for a capitalist economy. It is bad for everybody. We cannot have capitalism without growth. So the question is: **can we have a good kind of growth and, hence, save capitalism?**\n\n**Goodwin model does not consider needs/preferences and is another problem!** The workers share of output $u$ ($1-u$ are profits) is basically the products bought by workers **with their wages** assuming that they spend all their money in consumption. There are things enjoyed by workers that are not in $u$ (leisure, sunsets, free beer): a common trick to raise profits is to add more stuff in $u$ (commodification?). Another aspect is that Goodwin's model assumes that the output of production is always consumed, so there is no need to create needs. But  **If nobody buy my stuff, my products do not have value.**\n\nI think that extensions or new models including natural resources wasting/pollution (aka bad and good growth), needs/preferences and finance are all interesting.

Perhaps the most relevant to this forum is \"[a plan to rescue the web from the internet](https://staltz.com/a-plan-to-rescue-the-web-from-the-internet.html)\". I also recommend this talk I gave this year: \"[the internet in 2030](https://mixitconf.org/2019/the-internet-in-2030)\" (hint: it's a lot about climate crisis).\n\n@zelf is who encouraged me to finally make this post. We recently sat down in Helsinki for a podcast/interview. Link and transcript below. \n\nNice to meet you all and happy holidays! \n\n## [Interview audio](https://soundcloud.com/andrestaltz/zenna-interviews-andrestaltz/s-YT8br)\n\n## Transcript\n\nZenna:\n*Welcome to the fourth episode of the Edgeryders podcast on the Human-Centric Internet. Today, we have Andre Staltz with us. Andre Staltz is a thinker, writer and a programmer. You're particularly well known for having done Cycle.js.*\n\nAndre:\n*Yeah, I'd say like maybe two years ago, that was like two or three years, that was the top thing. So I got invited to a lot of JavaScript conferences related to that Cycle.js. Nowadays, I'm doing more scuttlebutt things.*\n\nZenna:\n*Especially nowadays: Manyverse.*\n\nAndre:\n*Yeah Manyverse is my main project, actually, they're kind of related so I used Cycle.js to build Manyverse.*\n\nZenna:\n*We've had a few hours of conversation before this.*\n\nAndre: \n*Yeah, actually.*\n\nZenna: \n*Which is awesome. Yeah. To start off in general, though, do you want to give your take on Scuttlebutt because I don't think I've interviewed anyone about it as part of this series.*\n\nAndre: \n*Yeah, um, my take on scuttlebutt. So scuttlebutt, I discovered it, like as a, as a process that I just suddenly, you know, I want to move on and build new stuff I wanted to like join some project that's like very promising or interesting and purposeful. And I looked at a lot of projects, and many of those were related to blockchain. And because I saw that, you know, the control that tech giants have over the current situation of the internet is quite, quite strong and relevant. So it seems like a problem to solve and I saw, you know, looked a lot of blockchain projects and wasn't particularly convinced that they are, you know, there was that time when the IPOs were just like, everyone know, ICOs, I'm sorry, we're everywhere. And so this ICO for everything, and you kind of felt like, they just want the money here, you know, and not so there was some content as well anyway. And then I stumbled upon scuttlebutt, and I was like, this is interesting, but what like kept me in scuttlebutt and what fascinated me in scuttlebutt was that it, it worked in a very different way of things that I've seen before.* \n\n*So it it's a protocol for, let's say, a decentralized social network. And I've worked with social networks before, like, I had a startup that did a forum discussion platform. And, you know, startups usually fail, mine failed as well. But in in that one, I wanted to get right, the idea of moderation, like, you know, like, how can we have moderation without that being like a fixed dictator model, which is, like the model that exists in many forums. It's like, Well, here's the community. And here's the dictator. Like, obviously, that's going to run into a lot of problems for the community because there's a dictator and so I wanted to solve that problem. And I came up with like this fluid model of moderation. But what really fascinated me and scuttlebutt is that I was always looking for, \"Okay, what is the moderation model here like where's The where's the power? And how are people, you know, policing What's going on?\" And I just couldn't find it. And I was like, why is there no model and at the same time that I couldn't find it, it also felt like the nicest place that I've been on the internet so far. And I was like, How can this be? And it just fascinated me. And I was like, there's something going on here. And like, the more I got involved with it, the more interesting it became. And then there was also like, a really strong community. So I think like, the things that Scuttlebutt are doing is doing in the space of social networks is very interesting. I think it's bringing a new narrative to trust, for instance. So far, like people have trusted the platform or trusted the moderators. And now in scuttlebutt, it's kind of like, well, you have people in your life that you trust. Let's just use that. Like, we're not going to introduce any platform trust any sort of dictated moderator trust is just people you know and that's it. Yeah. So that's my take on Scuttlebutt and what really fascinated me and, and I decided like, okay, I want to help this and there wasn't like a mobile app. So I thought, okay, mobile is very big. So I think I can help in that sense. Yeah. So Manyverse is Scuttlebutt on mobile.*\n\nZenna:  \n*you mentioned it in passing there. There's a lot of conversations that happen on Scuttlebutt. And there's also a lot of like, ideas that float around. I'm thinking, number one, there's a lot of cool conversations happening on Scuttlebutt. But yeah, you write a lot of great longer posts. And if we take this back to a conversation we had previously on collective intelligence, we were talking about how to utilize it to map together our understanding. Do you want to bring back what you described to me?*\n\nAndre:  \n*Yeah. I think there's all kinds of ideas like that, you know, how we could utilize scuttlebutt and not just like, Hey, here's a tool we can utilize it. But there's a lot of like concepts and ideology. I wouldn't say it's not yet ideology, it's more like ideas that can become ideology, sort of like in scuttlebutt, what matters are the people that you're connected to. And that's, that's what creates like substance and content. And it's it's also the infrastructure so like, the network topology in scuttlebutt is your network of friends. So network topology means it's kind of like a computer infrastructure concept, that let's say you have a bunch of computers, and how are those computers connected to each other? So in something like let's say Facebook, you have actually in Sweden, you have a data center for Facebook that has a bunch of computers there, and those computers are talking each other, like in that data center, they're also talking to a data center all around the other side of the planet in California, let's say to, you know, update the data. And that the way that those computers are connected to each other, has almost nothing to do with how the human relationships are connected to each other. So let's say I'm friends with with you and you're in Sweden, the way the the computers are going to negotiate that and how the computers are connected to each other has nothing to do with that is just add, they just, you know, it's social. Yeah, I mean, in the end, they do deliver the data for us and that kind of thing. But like, yeah, it doesn't work.  And something like a discussion forum, you know, you have a server that is somewhere. And that's where all of the data is. And the network topology in that situation is everybody who's in the forum, has some laptop or some mobile phone and those computers are talking to that server. So it's like a kind of like a star situation where you have this server in the middle, and a bunch of you are connecting to that. And that's the network topology.* \n\n*So what Scuttlebutt is like is, if I'm friends with you, then my computer connects with your computer. And that's it. There's like no computer in the middle that we connect to. You see? So what that happens, what that does is that it sort of so the network topology in the other services are usually invisible. We don't see them, we don't see how are the computers talking to each other? It doesn't kind of we don't care about them, but in scuttlebutt, because the network topology is the social connections, suddenly, the network topology is visible, we know what it is, it's because it's the same as the social connections and we know what the social connections are. So I think these ideas are very promising, because suddenly, computer connections start becoming more like a day to day concept for us, because our computer You know, let's say my computer represents who I am on the internet, and it gets to connect with your computer. So it has a bit more like, there's more substance to these connections. I mean, these connections are not, they become more important, because because let's say if I stop being your friend, my computer's not connecting to your computer anymore, and then I might get less data. So it becomes more real. I mean, there's more substance to it. For instance, if I would like, let's say, block you on Twitter, and I wouldn't do that. But anyway, if I would block you on Twitter, you could make another account and follow me and you still get my data. Right, it didn't really matter that I blocked you. It didn't have any sort of like that blocking didn't have like a substance in the network topology, whereas was scuttlebutt and if I would block you, you would not have that connection to get my data anymore, and you would have to get it from other people. So what was the initial question about collective Intelligence?*\n\nZenna:  \n*Yeah, you just described it. And what you described is basically a system that replicates the human interaction.*\n\nAndre:  \n*Yes, yes. Yeah.*\n\nZenna: \n*Yeah. Which means from a network topology, you can see the direct connections also between the data and for collective intelligence. What could that mean?*\n\nAndre:  \n*So I think the best example that we have, well, one of the best or most visible examples, we have a collective intelligence on the internet today is say Wikipedia. So a bunch of people get together and put their intelligence together and they make one single article about this thing. And when you use Wikipedia, you don't often see the authors you just see the outcome. You know, you see the, you know, this is what this intelligent thing wrote. And it's really like some intelligent thing, wrote it or some intelligent crowd wrote it, I think we can we can get better at doing that kind of thing, because there's a lot of obstacles in writing on Wikipedia.* \n\n*Yeah, like I submitted once scuttlebutt article for Wikipedia, and it took like weeks to be reviewed. And then when it was finally reviewed, they were like, this is not suitable for Wikipedia. And I was like, What is suitable then? Like it was so vague of an answer. So you kind of noticed that there are better ways how we can do this. And I think that this, let's say, to come together as a crowd and produce an intelligent an article such as something on Wikipedia. So I think we need something like Wikis on scuttlebutt. And what would that mean? So for instance, let's get something simple, like a cookie recipe. I could have my cookie recipe, and this is like the best that I've found so far. And then let's say I make friendship with someone like let's say you, and then I suddenly would have access to all the articles that you wrote. And maybe you have a recipe for cookies that's actually better than mine. So I can decide like Okay, I could possibly, let's say, click like \"accept your recipe\" and then I would update my recipe to be your recipe. But, except that you add like the say Cardamom on the cookie. And I don't like that. So I'm just going to remove that. So there could be like, new ways of adapting each other's intelligence and merging them in ways that don't require global consensus. So one of the aspects of scuttlebutt is that it doesn't require a global consensus.* \n\n*I'm maybe getting too much ahead of myself. But what I'm trying to get is to is that Wikipedia, it is about global consensus, essentially. And there's a lot of other things on the internet that our global consensus, For instance, blockchain is global consensus. There's like, The Blockchain is like gigabytes I think, or maybe terabyte I don't know how big it is right now. It's very big. And what it means is like it's the global ledger of all the Bitcoin transactions, and it's a global consensus system.* \n\n*Global consensus is a very difficult problem to solve I think. I think we're getting too much ahead of ourselves. I think we should try to solve like smaller cases of consensus. And that's kind of the space where Scuttlebutt operates in because you only need to think about, okay, what does this mean in my social space, like the people that I am interacting with? Maybe, you know, if you make a cookie recipe on Wikipedia, there will be all kinds of opinions from all kinds of experts and people, that it's actually a very difficult process to, you know, review all of those things. And there's a lot of friction, I think. So I think scuttlebutt helps us have a smaller barrier to participate in collective intelligence because the collective is not so huge as like global. It's basically like the people that you're in interaction with the people that you trust and it's very, very liquid for that sort of, like, flexible and liquid. Because let's say someone that was friends with like, had good cookie recipes and stuff and good let's say recipes to not just food but like let's say how to build stuff right. Like, like Let's say 3d printing stuff. If relationships change, I could later like not be connected to them, and I would sort of not receive their ideas anymore. So it's a bit more fluid in the sense that we don't need to fully agree. But we can, like choose who we want to agree with. And yeah, it's a bit more fluid. So I think it is important that we find ways of making that that collaboration faster. Because obviously, like if I submit an article to Wikipedia and takes weeks to review, that's, that's not good.*\n\nZenna:  \n*It's almost like it sounds to me almost like you're suggesting a way to form a collective brain.*\n\nAndre:\n*Yeah, or collective neurons. I mean, beginning somewhere small and Yeah, actually, the brain is a huge thing. So I think the brain is like the ultimate goal if we could create a collective brain. But yes, it's going towards that direction, basically, sort of like some people have some insights. Some other people have other insights. How can we get there? sites and put them together. What's very interesting about the brain is that there's no central part, like hierarchically distributed, that this is the ultimate neuron that tells those neurons how to interact with each other. It's like not a tree is definitely like, is actually So, so mixed up and constantly evolving that, like, we don't understand the brain, like people don't understand the brain yet. It's like literally like a huge mesh of chaos. And that's your brain.*\n\nZenna:  \n*Yeah, a great example of that, when people split the brain. And different parts of the body.*\n\nAndre: \n*Oh, yeah. Yeah, so I've been reading some books and like brain is not. So we have this idea that we are individual and that we have like a simple idea of who we are and things like that. But like the brain is so diverse, like it, like how it functions that the left side and the right side can take different decisions. So some scientists, I think psychological and the psychology field. They did some experiments that, you know, if you shut down, like, I think if you induce some waves and sort of little bit shut down the influence of one side of the brain, then it will take one decision. And if you shut the other side down, then the right side will choose yet another decision. I think it was something like on the question, they they put someone in the test chair, their visual field was controlled by one side of the brain, and it showed them one image only on one eye. And then they asked what you want to be when you grow up? And they said one answer and then the other in the other case, they did the opposite. And the person answered, I want to be this thing when I grow up. So it's literally if you ask someone like who are you? The question depends on what part of the brain are you talking to? So yeah, the brain is a very complex thing. I don't even want to pretend I know about that.*\n\nZenna:  \n*I want to just throw in one comment because you talk about left hand side right side of the brain and Society of left and right.*\n\nAndre:\n*Oh, yeah, that's kind of interesting.*\n\nZenna: \n*And if you cut off communications between them you get two different worlds. Oh, yeah.* \n\nAndre:\n*And also it makes the point that there is no such Central Party. Right? Yeah. That I never thought about that. But we are getting to a point as society where the decisions of the collective sometimes are more interesting than the decisions of individuals.*\n\nZenna:  \n*I actually... is it okay if I bring you back to when we were on collective intelligence - you mentioned this system of sharing neurons almost became because... or sharing understanding of the world or whether the cookie recipe or 3d printing. Do you think those possible now we're now just like expanding, thinking big, do you think it's possible to extend that kind of collective and Intelligence into how we build infrastructure and society?*\n\nAndre:  \n*The answer is yes. Because there's a lot of knowledge and that is locked in, in many institutions. Basic know how. And that knowledge is is it like the idea that we share information is an idea that the internet started like promoting that, you know, we get information, we put it out there and we, you know, share it? Well, I don't know exactly where it started. But like, one of the main examples was, for instance, the p2p movement, you know, like, by the time that like people started sharing mp3 files, you had this idea that Well, I have, like this music file, but it's just information I can share that information and is we just all enrich each other, you know, this idea that we can enrich each other. And then came like the a open source movement, which is basically this idea of like, you know, institutions such as companies and like universities, they all had like information such as code that was valuable to them, but it was locked, like in their institutions.* \n\n*So if you could get that know how, and just like release it out there. I think the easiest case, of course, is with software because the information is the software, right? So it's a bit more direct. And it's also because they are so involved with computers that are very obviously involved with the internet. So it's obvious that like the open source movement group, but I'm thinking what would be the open source movement for other institutions such as, you know, maybe health institutions or educational institutions that like they have know how, and it's sometimes locked in people sometimes locked in special institutions, but I think there's a lot of things that start happening once you start releasing all that knowledge. And it has to happen on something. So for instance, open source happened on GitHub, or basically a platform. And it has to that's where, you know, people have to find the each other, that's the thing, right? How do they find each other, then we start talking about things such as either social networks, and GitHub is a social network or protocols for social network. And that's where sort of scuttlebutt comes into the picture.* \n\n*Actually, you know, I think we should really emphasize that email is a decentralized protocol. And it has helped for decentralizing information and sharing information also, between institutions. I mean, email is actually a really big thing that helps us share knowledge. And we need to remember that, you know, that's just one of the things that we can do, we could do much more than that we could like have much better systems than just email.*\n\nZenna: \n*To add on to that you you mentioned how we start sharing that information. And for the infrastructures of society, we also already do have computer controlled mechanics, which means that building even hardware or building physical things still so computer data can The open source it isn't as code, which is pretty amazing.* \n\n*Before we round up, you mentioned also that scuttlebutt is essential in the sense that it's a social network. And it's interesting because it is so easy to build collective intelligence upon a social network that also replicates the human structure that we use to share data between humans.* \n\n*Are there any shout outs? Any universe here we do this any anything else that you'd like to throw out there before we run this out?*\n\nAndre:  \n*universe? Hear me? Um, what kind of thing?*\n\nZenna:\n*It can be. I don't know. Anything. Thanks to your ManyVerse backers.*\n\nAndre:\n*Oh, yes. Well, definitely. I have to thank them. That's that's that's one thing that Yeah, I'm actually very happy that like people like some some of them have donated an amount that if I would do it myself, I would find it like this is this is ridiculous. And I'm really thankful for those people.* \n\n*And I also think that I need more help in general. One of the things that I'm noticing is that there is actually a scarcity of people and resources in one of these fields that seemingly looks like it's, it's on fire and it's like awesome, such as open source, for instance, it seems like everything like open source is the hottest thing, but there's actually scarcity of people and resources and funding and stuff. So for instance, I've talked with a couple of other people who are concerned about open source funding we have this call where we were like talking you know, what can we do and stuff. The situation is looking pretty negative, but my my shout out is this is the future and it's like, it's not because I want it to be the future because it's actually changing world like crazy way. We need to sort of think okay, how do we fit this into? Not necessarily how do we fit this into The society that has existed is so far, we need to think, Okay, how do we build society with this or on this? And I think we need a lot more people and resources. And we also need to get together with more people from other fields, I think, like these, you know, programmers who are doing open source and stuff, I think they should be talking to anthropologists and people who have been thinking about, you know, I don't know, actually I don't know. But the point is, like, we need to get better at finding people from other fields. And I'm not blaming anyone, I'm not saying that the programs are too stuck into the corners. I'm just saying that we also, we not only miss people in funding, we miss opportunities to bridge with other communities, other fields of research and other kind of stuff. And we need to create a dialogue with that.*  \n\n*There's just this potential for things to happen. And for things to get better in this field that seems to be taking fire, beyond fire and like in really being hyped and stuff. I just want to be part of that in some way.*\n\nZenna:  \n*Thank you guys for listening. Thank you. And thank you, Andre. for sharing, fantastic worlds. For those of you who see the potential in the structure: shout out. There definitely seems to be a chance for a different world.* \n\n*So that wraps it up.*\n\nAndre: \n*Thank you for inviting me to the podcast.*", "created_at": "2019-12-22 17:00:09.331948", "updated_at": "2019-12-22 17:00:09.331948", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4391, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 205.2, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5538, 4022, 8, 5698, 4934, 5883], "is_private": false}, {"id": 62556, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11104, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Heads up: the internal links of the website that we communicated in these past days are now broken.

Basically all of the LOTE conferences that we held over the years are of that format; we called them (un-)conference initially and since LOTE6, the \"Open Village Festival\" we call them festivals.\n\nThis type of event will last two or three days and include:\n\n* some plenary sessions\n* multiple (2-4) event rooms with parallel sessions that people can attend based on interest\n* a party on the last day's evening\n\nWe organize the parallel sessions by inviting members of the Edgeryders community (esp. of the project to which the event is dedicated) to make session proposals.\n\nThe ticket will not cost money, but it is expected that everyone contributes in some way in making the event happen. How strict this expectation is and if the contributions are verified or not depends on the festival. Usually we have been quite lax with this, and it did not hurt as all the events got organized somehow :)\n\nAll the articfacts from the past Edgeryders festival events are still online here on edgeryders.eu.

I caught it last week but I\u2019m coming to a response late from other things. I don\u2019t know anything about GDPR or much about data protection in general but the discussion touches on a number of topics that interest me; policy re-designed as a tool for a networked and complex world and what Illich would refer to as the \u2018radical monopoly\u2019 that our procurement systems create. \n\nBut it\u2019s another of Illich\u2019s concepts that seems to be the thread running through this conversation - the systemic problems that arise from growing institutionalisation. As Marco mentions \u201c_bureaucracy tries to optimise for one model_\u201d and for me this is the nub. It is entirely unsuited to operating within systems thinking perspectives and perhaps this is what is called for beyond creating multiple models.\n\n \n\nSystems account for and allow a greater degree of variation and adaption unlike as you say, bureaucracy that seeks to encourage standardisation because this is one of the conditions it needs to operate. This is also how I would understand why institutions can\u2019t replicate bottom up approaches @markomanka - they are founded in two completely different _operating systems_ to use Winnie\u2019s term. It strikes me that the ethics training of Mandarins that @alberto mentions facilitated operation in a living system - and therefore able to cope with the infinite variations that played out across Imperial China. Ethics and data protection compliance are the symptoms in this context but to my mind, the underlying malaise is hyper-institutionalisation.\n\nI also see another dilemma unfolding in the discussion that may be helpful to tease out. There would appear to be an inherent tension not just in this thread but also within Edgeryders itself between responding to immediate needs and contributing to generative creation of  completely new approaches and responses. For example there is some necessity in meeting immediate needs of those undertaking Opencare work -  to pull in resources to support their work or to understand the implications of future changes such as compliance. At the same time, there is a pull - to work on the \u2018long shots\u2019, the longer term, bigger impact projects that @winnieponcelet mentions. \n\nA frame I\u2019ve found useful is [Three Horizons](http://www.internationalfuturesforum.com/three-horizons). Briefly: Horizon One (H1) is the dominant system, business as usual. Horizon Three (H3) for me represents a different paradigm - or a completely new way of doing things. Horizon Two (H2) is the space of innovation and this can go two ways: either prolong H1 (H2-) or open up H3 (H2+). It strikes me that Edgeryders and OpenCare are operating across all three horizons. Horizon One has been outlined in the proposition for OpenCare as rising health care costs and care systems struggling to meet demand. In exploring DIY welfare, OpenCare researches activity that falls into H2 stretching into H3. I\u2019m not totally clear yet whether the underlying goal for OpenCare is H2-; that is enabling the current way of doing things simply to function better or H2+/H3 - paving the way for the \u2018completely new\u2019?\n\nSo in this discussion there are the immediate H1 needs of projects to sustain their work. What role does OpenCare (or might a session at OV) play in meeting these needs? But beyond this is there also a role to call for structural changes that get to the root of the problem? And this is where we hit up against mutually exclusive sets of interests.

(Latent) He has 30 years experience in European research management, which he puts at our (and the community's disposal. \n1. (Latent) He is conditionally available to step out of his comfort zone and work on stuff we need done. He mentioned the #research-network:economic-sci-fi seminar; which is handy, as I am out of a team right now, but might have a client.\n1. (Needs active coordination) I have decided to take the RezNet to peek into his scholarly territory. Specifically, I am interested in the intersection between social sciences and geosciences. I see a window where we would do a digital ethnography of \"sustainability\", looking at its ethical implications and how much of capitalism, nation states and other pillars of our present civilization people think need to go if humanity is to survive in reasonable ecological balance. @sander's parent organization might also be interested in partnering up with us, if we find the right call. \n\nActive coordination, immediately, means this:\n\n### 1.

In the meeting, you are to discuss the next batch of calls (November and March), looking for a fit where Martin could conceivably take point. Remember: this also means he has to go out and pitch prestigious unis, starting by those who already were funded under the relevant calls etc. etc. I will attend if I can, but Martin and I have already met, so it is more important that Marina is there. \n\n@nadia maybe you want to be there too, to pick Martin's brain on strategic matters.\n\nMarina, please make sure you come out of that meeting with a to-do list and a timeline to do things by :slight_smile:\n\nMartin: **please bring your laptop and phone**. Marina, please help Martin get on the Matrix, so we get rid of email. @matthias should already have created credentials for him.  \n\n### 2. July skunkworks\n  \nI have invited Martin to the [digital ethnography skunkworks](/t/9712). It's a fast way to onboard him to our methodology.

Instead of accessing PostgreSQL directly, you could take a database dump of only the relevant Discourse data, import it to SQLite, and then work with your Python script on that.\n\nIt really depends what we want to do with this, and how much it's worth it to us. As a Discourse plugin with API (my latest idea, see below), it would be a different type of software and need more care. Maybe check the concept below and let me know your opinion.\n\n[quote=\"felix.wolfsteller, post:3, topic:11905\"]\n> Anybody who\u2019d love to take this on?\n\nWhat exactly does that question mean?\n[/quote]\n\nActually, I didn't think too much about that question means before asking. Just to see if there's an interest (there is!), and then we can discuss. Meanwhile I had some more ideas, which I put below. There is not really a defined timeframe for this, and surely nothing tight \u2013 up to 3 months would sound alright to me. As for the budget: I have to discuss it with Alberto. We might want to invest a moderate budget. If you want, you could send us your estimate for the first version's functionality (see below), which would give an orientation for us to decide if we want the version I sketch out below, or rather a proof-of-concept Python script that Alberto proposes above.\n\nRegarding the ideas: when Alberto said \"if you want to release something\" above, I thought that the right place for this code is in a Discourse plugin that provides a custom API endpoint, serving text files in the Gource custom log format.\n\n**First version:** There would be a request parameter to only generate the log file for one single Discourse category. If not specifying that, it would be generated for the platform's whole content. Only content creation would be considered, not edits to posts or wiki posts and also not deleting posts.\n\n**Second version:** After the proof-of-concept first version, if we decide to go further with this, it would make sense to provide for extended request parameters:\n\n* list of Discourse categories (by name or ID) to filter which posts to include\n* flag to include or exclude the sub-categories of these categories\n* list of Discourse tags to filter which posts to include\n* parameter to configure the colors to use for actions\n\nAlso, this version should include a simple GUI in the Discourse admin backend that allows to configure these parameters and then to generate and download the corresponding Gource Custom Log file by clicking a button.\n\nI don't think there is a need to integrate Gource more closely. Downloading the file and then calling the Gource command line tool with that file on ones local computer and uploading the resulting video to YouTube is already quite comfortable. It is also fast, as the code has direct access to the Discourse database.\n\nI think this tool would not be used *very* widely, but it would be a software that is interesting and creates beautiful outcomes, so it would certainly gets its share of attention.\n\n**Third version:** Now we could add another way of visualization, namely for our Open Ethnographer data. People would appear to not collaborate around topics, but around ethnographic codes. Our ethnographic codes can be organized in a hierarchy, so it also lends itself to be visualized with Gource easily. Whenever somebody contributes something that is codes with a certain code, a little colored dot would be added to that code's node in the Gource visualization.", "created_at": "2019-11-25 22:51:38.376539", "updated_at": "2019-11-25 22:58:23.027067", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 647, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [65755, 65771], "is_reply_to": [65755, 65771], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33403, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2154, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Agree with K!</b>\n\nand in addition to that, Edgeryders don't forget to add\u00a0links to the content you're sharing about us and \\#Lote3, it's good if people can check the info and get a better sense of it...! not to mention it also drives some traffic.

Not as much in the sense of its general quality and accessibility from the systemic point of view, which is, despite some center-periphery disbalances, considered to be reasonably good and mostly free of charge - rather some deeper structural dysfunctions and issues of approaching patients in the public system are coming to surface. When moving from general to specific level, the members of the community shared certain anxiety stemming from contradictory diagnoses and treatments to which they have been subjected even in the very same institution and they discussed possible ways out: patient empowerment; non-Western medicine; seeking health care abroad; reaching out to their acquaintances-insiders; or paying for their treatment in the private sphere. A related question arose in the terms of the quality of service provided by the immigrant medical workforce - specifically Ukrainian medical staff - where the general picture is quite ambiguous, though not necessarily xenophobic. However, entirely giving up on the public health care is not the preferred solution. It seems to be perceived as an important cornerstone of the welfare and social cohesion, an important item in understanding the post-transitional collective societal identity in the Czech Republic, therefore improvement rather than abandonment is the major issue.\n\nThe housing situation is another major problem reflected on the forum, with its current dire inaccessibility for low and middle-income groups, especially in the major cities. The incapability of the political representatives to steer the situation in the direction of adequate solutions has been criticized and community members push for a different conceptualization of the housing itself: they promote a paradigmatic shift from the neoliberal commodified one to understanding housing as a right and basic living necessity. For practical solutions, they look up to the local community-based activism, establishing associations that will continue sketching sustainable long term strategies and revitalization of unused and deteriorating objects with the purpose of creating housing capacities or public spaces. The general bottom-up push is understood as a vehicle of turning the attention on the level of political and administrative agenda from the immobilities market interests to these grassroots movements and precarized groups of tenants.\n\nThe third important topic emerging on the platform is environmental issues, which have been gaining overwhelming momentum in the country during the last 6 months. The community members express the need to overcome provincialism and push for understanding the Czech Republic in a wider, global context and contribute to setting the environmental concerns on the top of the agenda. Besides that, they have shared numerous experiences with partaking in community projects related to environmental preservation and communal waste limiting that seem to have slipped under the radar from wider attention, crediting them on the platform.", "created_at": "2019-11-28 09:41:50.172913", "updated_at": "2019-11-28 09:41:50.172913", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 472, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 23.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [65201], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60655, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 11022, "post_number": 1, "raw": "## Brief: Edgeryders questionnaire\n\nWe are deploying a new onboarding funnel for edgeryders.eu.

Did you also have a hand in shaping those projects?\n[/quote]\nAthens has slowly been developing innovative projects, particularly since the Greek debt crisis of 2011 when a period of severe economic austerity began. Many public services were significantly cut or removed altogether, which led to civil unrest and citizens taking certain responsibilities into their own hands. From about 2015, the municipality has tried to support a number of the initiatives. I have been working closely with the Vice-Mayor of Athens who is responsible for civil society action and innovation (an interesting combination), and who needs to raise significant resources from other sources (private foundations, business, EU funding programs, etc) to develop projects. Initially, I got involved with Athens having been asked by the British Council and Rockefeller Foundation to produce a report on culture as a means of developing city resilience, using Athens as a case study. This was linked to the 100 Resilient City initiative that had been pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, which focused mainly on issues and methodologies connected to developing a city's resilience to economic, environmental and social crises. Athens had been selected to be one of the 100 resilient cities. After completing the study, the city asked me to help guide them through the bidding process, and building the case for Athens to be designated Innovation Capital of Europe, which was decided last November. I have been asked to continue to advise on how the award could be utilised, with enormous constraints on time and resources. One of the intended projects will be a conference and 'expo' on social innovation to be held in Athens at the end of February 2019.

Great work, thanks!\n\nI like less the process: it looks too much like a beauty contest, and beauty contests are easy to game. We don't want people squabbling about votes, or registered users that only log in once, cast a vote for their friends and go.\n\nI think we want the community to express itself in the form of comments rather than votes. This takes away much of the strategic incentive, because you can't fake a convincing case for a project. This also gives maneuverng space for top-down filtering - which, I agree is badly needed. So you basically get top-down resposibility with bottom-up advice: when the bottom-up cases are good and more or less unanimous, you can just shut your eyes and wave the project through. When in doubt, exert top-down selection.\n\nThe conundrum is: I can't think of anyone that could be sure of doing a good job of acting as a top-down selection mechanism. I certainly would not trust myself to do a good job of it! People do all kinds of crazy things, and I only understand a tiny fraction of the whole spectrum.\u00a0\n\nSo, we would probably be looking at a rather messy discussion involving people making a case for their own projects; a community giving feedback; local people proposing needs to address; and some diverse \"council of the wise\" somewhere having the final say.\u00a0\n\nHmmm.

Moreover, we suffer from a documented psyhological bias called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect\">halo effect</a>, that makes us assume that success trasfers across domains. If you are a successful marathon runner, I will rate higher your\u00a0chances of starting a viable company, even though the skills involved with running marathons are not the same ones needed to run a business. People will help more gladly others when they think they are winners. By doing so, they will increase the chances of success of these perceived winners.\u00a0So, being <em>perceived</em> as successful increases your chances of <em>actually</em> being successful.\u00a0\n\nThat's not to say you cannot define your own measure of success. But it does mean this is a lot easier when done in tribes. If you inhabit a cluster of the global social graph that goes by different rules, you are kind of OK being different, because your social network is also different, and that means you can mobilize those people to help in whatever it is you are doing. You can enjoy a reasonable measure of social esteem, even if it is localized in your corner of the graph.\u00a0\n\nAn unfortunate consequence of this is that, the more different you want to be, the more energy\u00a0you need to invest promoting yourself. The message is \"look at me, I am not a failure, I am a success by my own measure\". Social media are full of this, often cloaked in hyper-individualistic narratives, of the \"I quit my day job to follow my dream\" type. Which is ironic, because\u00a0hyper-individualists (if they exist) do not care about what people on Facebook think of them. Self-promotion is, in my opinion, the expression of a deep need\u00a0for social acceptance.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-26 08:07:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:18.140578", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 379, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23909], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 66119, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 11021, "post_number": 46, "raw": "form is send. @noemi, do you no people in Brussels who would be interested going there and taking some pictures?", "created_at": "2019-11-28 09:56:51.011276", "updated_at": "2019-11-28 09:56:51.011276", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 20, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 11.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [65914], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73634, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13125, "post_number": 2, "raw": "@justinpickard?

I hope that is a little bit clear....\n\nI think that is very hard change in few time the situation of the italian istitutions. There are more different reason about the problems of the istituzion and of the european identity . The most important problem is the aging of the political. There are always the same people in the istitutions. The young people that would to enter in the policy, they are blocked and <span><span>exploited.... And there are old politicals that haven't new knowledge</span></span> and relations with other european people. They don't know the new media istruments, internet and so and so... They don't know the Policy 2.0 :D\n\nI think that the people survive in terms of the problem of the <span><span>improvement</span></span> of the knowledge. They are closed and with a \"provincial\" thought. they don't know that to work and to communicate with other people of other country it's very important. they think that the EU it's as a \"bancomat\", where arrive there take the money where is possible and then come back in Italy. they don't know that the system it's compltly different and they don't know the system of the lobby. In Italy isn't possible to continue only with the system of the <span><span>recommendations!!!!\n\nThe italians are persons very </span></span><span> <span>good</span> <span>and now it's the time to change the situation and all the people that have contact with other country, they have the task to educate where is possibile in Italy with the knowlodge acquired with abroad experiences.</span></span>\n\nFurthermore, sure the survival caused of the <span><span>employment contracts unsafe, precarious and that don't take at the young securety for the future! The young don't have future and the salrias are very </span></span>minimum and so the people have serious difficult to arrive at the end of the month!\n\nSo every time that a youg man try to built a personal future with his personality, in Italy he hasn't success, because there isn't meritocracy and there isn't the right way to have a good salary. So win only who know someone that can help him and it's impossible to have aid, advices and italian or european founds.\n\nSo these are the reasons because we are surviving....\n\n\u00a0\n\nI have 33 years old and I don't have enought money to built my house to live with my girlfriend and it's very later.... but I woulnd't built something without my capacity and my strenght!!!

You're the toast of the town and of Lote, so I'm sure these much needed resources will come through.\u00a0I'm <a href=\"/t/unmonastic-principles-of-administration-a-call-for-design-solutions/1820/10\">reading Ilaria</a> on the other post and I kind of agree. Before really giving this call a push you and us here should think of how to make it more easy to herd while also following up on the potential offers, and making\u00a0the\u00a0team more transparent and coherent\u00a0outwards. Otherwise you risk having yet more people interested in the good unMon vibe but not being able to nurture their engagement since there are not established channels.\u00a0\n\nAnother way to go - considering you already have an ongoing big recruitment call for unMonasterians, is to recruit directly from Edgeryders coming to Lote who are up for getting involved in the unMonastery track. Frame this post\u00a0as a call to join the Edgeryders Building unMonastery track \u00a0with these 3 sessions\u00a0- adding a short\u00a0introductory paragraph.\u00a0I then can help point to this post, reach out to those registered who say are interested and see who wants to join it and help lead sessions within the track. let me know.. For us it's not such a big effort including this in the newsletter and online Friday calls, since we're preparing for Lote anyway and continuously scouting for key help..\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-05 18:51:42", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:49.134172", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 265, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35728, "user_id": 854, "topic_id": 6977, "post_number": 13, "raw": "[quote=\"alberto, post:12, topic:6977\"]\nIt does not look like we can make further headway.

The village is a secret spot for surfers (\"best waves in Morocco\") and not invaded by normal tourists like Sidi Kaouki, so @unknown_author requested that we do not publish the name of this village, esp. not in relation to surfing. Surfers are reportedly mad people who become very mad if somebody publishes their secret spot :scream:\n\n**Price:**\n\nRoughly 850 - 1200 USD / month (700 - 1000 EUR / month) over the winter months when rented out to tourists.

And when it does, someone else gets dumped with the price to pay. The context of this observation is urban planning, and in particular the city of Brasilia, built from the ground up as a high modernist project. What happened there is that the \"rational\" city designed by Niemeyer could not function as a city, because it had no cheap accommodation, no street food, no hangouts etc. And so, promptly, favelas arose, to host the workers that were building the official Brasilia, and to perform the essential services that a city must provide, but that become incredibly difficult to produce under too strict and administrative grid.

What are you working on and why are you on the Internet Days?**\n\nI work with the camera production here. Started with a production company that did streaming. It was hard. how to get people with ADSL connection to watch a video stream that doesn't look fucked up. Since then, a generation has come this way. The older I get the more I feel the TV guys were right. There's a point in being able to do something and not bid on the last six hours of work because it was fun to do. You may need pay. That mix can be good.\n\nThere is a connection there to the internet. Started with people having their jobs to go to. Now we can Altavista R2D2. Star Wars had been seen. A ball robot. Can we find out through the internet? But now ... at least, I think about it, when it becomes marketable. It is easy to market the whole world and call itself a platform and not an employer. Selling child rape via webcams. It becomes an extreme when everyone can talk to everyone all the time and in addition\u2026\n\nThe content of what I think about the Internet itself is: Let people do their thing. I don't think we can talk and meet that is the problem. The problem is somewhere else, if it is as bad as I think it will be to exploit people on the right and left.\n\nThe more people who can refuel at Piratebay premiere, the fatter it will be, because more will come up with their ideas. Cut more good documentaries than child abuse.\n\nI think the good parts will consider. The bad ones do not disappear because we pretend.\n\n**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**\n\nI think it's very bad vibes with facebook. It probably could have been when I stopped doing facebook. I had an account that was not called me, then I stopped it, stopped responding to emails and got stubborn. Then I was happy. Whenever I would use a service or app, I was glad that I was something that really helped me in my everyday life. Check the subway, for example.\n\nI actually got really happy when I started to take the github a bit grand and would learn to write something in Node. then I could, because there are so many cordial people who helped. My little insight into people doing code, software online. Got an insight into that community. It was fat.\n\n**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**\n\nAlmost even. Same as with camera surveillance. One's data is like, if you find it unpleasant to have a camera in the facet, my data is even more ... I think like this: You build a giant system for monitoring and say I'm cool with it, because I still do nothing like is wrong. Then you can think that maybe you should start that reasoning in what one's democracy is, if it is democracy you want to use as a safety, or how I calm down with it, that I am cool with this. Then you can ask the question: What is democracy? That's a common answer. Everyone is kind and does something good, otherwise you can vote for it, so they can quit, there. Then you can partly think about: It is an experiment. And what is a democracy? What happens if it doesn't.\n\nFrom the narrow point of view, if one should consider that if it goes to hell, as it always does, what will the massive surveillance systems be used for?

A friend sent me a link and suggested it would be interesting to do a similar analysis on the velocity of circulation of money for Iceland. This link to be precise:\n\nhttp://www.investorsinsight.com/blogs/thoughts_from_the_frontline/archive/2010/03/13/the-implications-of-velocity.aspx\n\nI'm not an Economist, I'm a Computer Scientist with a rather bizarre hobby - I had to go and look it up.\n\nSomething about the idea that the velocity of circulation of money, the number of times each physical note, or bank deposit electron changes hands could affect the price level bothered me, but I couldn't put my finger on what. I went back to my rather quixotic task of trying to figure out how the banking system actually works. (Step 1, build a computer model, Step 2, discover almost no Economist you talk to about it has a clue how the banking system actually works...)\n\nIt stayed at the back of my mind though and continued to bother me. As a Computer Scientist, I specialise in networks and real time systems, so I'd come into Economics originally with a rather vague model of money as packets of information bouncing around and establishing a price level. Did the speed at which they did that really matter? It bothered me, I couldn't say why, I went and looked it up again.\n\nThe original source for this particular version of the Quantity Theory of Money(it turns out there's several, in and of itself not a good sign), turned out to be a book by an American Economist Irving Fisher written in 1911, called the Purchasing Power of Money:\n\nhttp://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1165&amp;layout=html\n\nThe thing that immediately struck me about the book was the date. You see, as part of trying to figure out how the banking system works, I'd spent a month going through the 19th Journal of the Statistical Society of London, and a couple of other 19th century Economics Journals I'd found lurking online, \u00a0and I'd established to my own satisfaction that the earliest that British Economists even appeared to have an inkling about the inately expansionary behaviour of the banking system was 1900 or so, a discovery which was accompanied by a raging debate over whether bank deposits even qualified as money. Money, as far as 19th century Economists were concerned was physical notes and coins.\n\nIt's fairly clear from his book that Fisher was in the bank deposits don't exactly qualify as money camp.\u00a0\n\nThe quantity theory of money itself, is a simple equation. M (quantity of money) * V (velocity of circulation of money) = P (average price level) * Q(total quantity of production). (If you're an engineer or a scientist btw., the first thing that's wrong about that equation is that the units don't match, but I digress.)\n\nThe second problem becomes clear when you look at the example Fisher provides in Chapter 1 section 2, and expand it out a little. Fisher starts with $5 million in money, and total purchases in a year of 200,000,000 loaves of bread, 10,000,000 tons of coal and 30,000,000 \u00a0yards of cloth, with the prices shown below.\u00a0\n\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"108\" src=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/sites/edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/files/fishertable.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"620\">\n\nWith $5 million in physical cash, it isn't possible to buy all the coal say at once, which would require $50 million, so a series of exchanges have to occur. $5 million buys 50 million loaves of bread say, the bread makers then buy 1 million tons of coal, the coal miners buy 5 million yards of cloth, and the cloth makers then get to buy some bread. All in all the money circulates around 20 times (which is of course the point), and on the other side of the equation, 20 separate transactions get made with it.\u00a0\n\nIn other words, the velocity of circulation of money can't affect the price level, because it cancels on both sides of the equation. Oops.\n\nI always wanted to be a scientist. Don't ask me why, I remember when I was a 9 year old writing an admission essay for the local grammar school, and describing why I wanted to be a scientist. Looking back I have no idea how a nine year old ends up wanting something like that, but I did, and the grammar school gave me a place, which ushered me onto the educational path that at least ends up giving you the training to be a scientist, even if I've spent most of my life doing something else. One of the most important things you learn is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proofs. Questioning the quantity theory of money is right up there on that scale.\n\nStill, I could also see why Fisher needed velocity. Fisher tried in his book to do something quite laudable, he tested his results against actual data. But Fisher didn't count bank deposits as money, even though British Economists like Dunbar around the same time were pointing out that 90% of all fiancial transactions were being conducted not with notes and coins but cheques. With an unknown expansionary force acting on the total quantity of money, prices were varying in ways Fisher had no way of explaining - and the velocity of circulation of money became a very convenient fudge factor. It still is. The Bank of England uses it to adjust their M4 money supply measure.\u00a0\n\nThen somethng else dawned on me. When Economists talk about the economy growing, what they mean is that a measurement called the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is growing. But GDP isn't the total amount of things produced, it's the total <em>value</em> of things produced. To get GDP you get the total value of everything that was sold in a year(price * quantity), modify by the inflation rate, and publish widely.\u00a0\n\nBut if you take the quantity theory of money in any way seriously, then that can't work, because if the total quantity of things produced increases - then the prices will drop. M = P * T'. Fruit is cheap in the autumn. Price is inversely related to quantity. GDP can only increase if either production decreases (causing price increases due to shortages), or the money supply increases. That of course, is why GDP 'works' - the money supply in most countries is more or less continuously increasing, and study the banking system for any length of time, and you will develop a rough feel for which countries have the fastest expanding money supplies. A quick check confirmed, they also had high GDP's.\n\nA friend of mine heroically volunteered to plough through a bunch of Central Bank sites and pull out the relevant money supply and GDP data. A bit of jiggerypokery with matplotlib, and we had a paper showing what happens to GDP if you normalise it to correct for the growth in the money supply. (In the majority of countries it's slowly shrinking, probably because money is getting pulled into the financial sector.) GDP it seems isn't measuring economic growth at all - it's just measuring the growth in the money supply.\n\nWell, that's what scientists do. They write papers, and try to get other people to read them (this it turns out is the really hard part.) With one honourable exception, none of the economists who so far admit to having read the paper understood what it meant to normalise data. [If you know that the tape measure you're measuring with has magically doubled in length, you can still use it to measure if you halve all the measurements you make.] My fellow engineers get it immediately, they're just not sure that that's really how GDP is being measured.\n\nOnce friends and colleagues have been exposed to it, the next step for any paper is to try and get it into a conference or journal. So far the paper's been rejected by two conferences and 2 journals. Without any response at all as to why.\n\nIn my own field that wouldn't happen. Question one of the central tennets of computer science, and have the timerity to submit it to a conference, and you can expect to get either a detailed description of your own stupidity, or an invitation to explain further. But as I'd already learned with the Banking System, this is Economics, they do things differently over there.\u00a0\n\nSo that's science. Looking at a problem, and trying to figure out if you're completely wrong, or if everybody\u00a0else is, and with mild humiliation as the most likely outcome. Papering the wall with rejection emails. \u00a0Some peer review would be nice. In the meantime\u00a0I'm building a computer model, it seems as good a way to explore the problem as any. A really simple economy with just a few employees, a farm, and a market to set prices. Something I can play around with, and try and figure out the math. So far it's not looking good for GDP. It's not looking good for the rest of the equation as it happens, but it's too early to be sure.\u00a0\n\nThere's something about it all though. Reading economics papers and realising that almost none of them normalise for the money supply growth. Looking at a computer model, a few figures updating, trying to work out if its behaviour is a bug, or a real feature of the monetary system. Caught on the edge of knowledge and belief as the results begin to match the hypothesis. Knowing, if nothing else, that that nine year old was totally right about wanting to be scientist.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-21 02:00:26", "updated_at": "2017-08-27 04:54:05.930124", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1719, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 10.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54119, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 10023, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Fascinating. @evangineer (who works at Holo), what is your take on this?\n\nI know that the EC has tasked the NGI Forward group to give blockchain an extra hard look.

This is even a harder question: who are the 'members' of The Reef? At the moment, we are doing different things at the same time - looking for a building (we have a [meeting in November with the Commune of Forest!)](https://edgeryders.eu/t/meeting-with-the-commune-of-forest-in-are-we-ready/11309/), also also looking for the people who actually see themselves living with others in what I see is a life project. This takes time, because it is a self selecting process, and it becomes a chicken egg problem: who's to say how it _should work_ if the people involved don;t yet have a direct stake in it (financial or social)? Like Malcolm says in this interview,  \n_I have to be careful on dispersing capital to a project like the Reef because the risk of losing it all is \nbig. The trust that has to be defined is Trust with capital T._ \n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/the-reef-community-20-years-in-brussels-and-i-still-have-a-feeling-of-not-belonging-here/11296\n\nWhat we can confidently do is lay the groundwork for some specifics which can later be adapted by the people staying on with this process. A session on the sociality of The Reef will definitely be part of the Co-design Sprint. I could really use help with that, would you want to help prepare it?\nPerhaps we could meet a few days before and see how to best facilitate it?

As you say, there are several of them, but (as you imply) they make little difference in the grand scheme of things.\u00a0\n\nWhat Trond Andresen proposes is a real alternative to the Euro that can knit national economic activity together, at least to some degree. What we have now are isolated attempts at currencies that hardly deserve the name, they are so small in comparison with what we call the \"real\" economy.\u00a0\n\nWhether the state would intervene is a question that can only be decided when such an alternative really takes off and becomes comparable in importance to national (or in our case Euro) currency. Historically, the more successful attempts of making alternative currencies have been suppressed. It was the case with the Austrian W\u00f6rgl experiment, terminated by the Austrian central bank, it was also the case with gold-based internet currencies that were taken down by the actions of the FBI in America just a few years ago.\u00a0\n\nIs it really so difficult to undertand that when you have economic trouble because there \"is no money\" as is the case in Greece and other EU countries, that it would be positive to bring into existence a kind of money that cannot be \"sucked out\" of the country to pay debt, a kind of money that must be used for internal economic activity... or that the resulting upswing in economic activity in that country could increase its earnings in Euro and therefore affect its capacity to pay back the debt it had to contract?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-06 09:17:05", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:21.950805", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 283, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12445], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75013, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13311, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello, dear community,\n\nI want to start off this week's conversation overview with the reiteration of the announcement that Edgryders stopped using Zoom effective immediately on Tuesday 21st after a disturbing \u201czoombomber\u201d.

I am always in contradiction with myself.

In\u017eenjer iz Taiwana mi je pokazao kako radi. Zadnji dan sam ostao sam sa In\u017eenjerima i morao sam sam da prevodim Engleski na Ma\u0111arski jezik.

Sad ovde ne znam ni sam koga bi trebalo pre da se primi da predaje. Ko ima veliku \u0161kolu taj pojma nema kako treba jedan \u010deki\u0107 da se dr\u017ei. Ja mislim bolje jedan majstor, nego velika \u0161kola koji nije ni probao svoju struku da radi (\u010dovek bez prakse).\n**Papir za potvrdu znanja:**\nSvakog ko izu\u010di svoj zanat, taj bi trebalo da dobije potvrdu \u0161ta zna da radi. Na kraju da imaju i ocenu za svoj rad. Ovo isto bi trebalo sa op\u0161tinom da se dogovori. Sa ovim bi mogli lak\u0161e da na\u0111u u\u010denici posao.\n\n**Izra\u010dunavanje tro\u0161kova:**\nOvo je isto jedan zanat. Mo\u017ee se dogovoriti sa u\u010denicima Ekonomske \u0161kole, po\u0161to oni mogu izra\u010dunaju dobitak proizvodnje ili gubitak. Ono \u0161to je najva\u017enije, treba da se izra\u010dunava sponzorstvo. Ovde bi moglo i takmi\u010denje da se uradi: ko mo\u017ee jeftinije da nabavi materijal za proizvodnju.\n**Pru\u017eanje prvog pomo\u0107i:**\nOvo je najbitnija stavka. Treba znati kako mo\u017eemo pru\u017eiti prvu pomo\u0107 na\u0161em radnom prijatelju, pre nego stigne ambulantna kola. Ga\u0161enje po\u017eara isto mo\u017ee \u017eivot da se spasi.

My writing style has definitely developed a more candid style since I've read and written blogs over the past 7 years. I don't tend to worry about my 'credibility' when I write. I've not done a PhD and don't work a lot with university academics, but I do mix with people who range from thoughtfully-practical to highly intellectual. There isn't really a worry about academic credibility in my discursive circles. In fact, I'm in a group of 'scholars' who are doing what we call Wikiquals. This is a collaborative community of researchers, who support each other to develop book-length or substantial research, which can be externally accredited by universities as PhD or similar, but doesn't have to be.\n\nMost of my colleagues, generally, are concerned to communicate as directly, clearly or passionately as possible with people they teach, parent, converse with or present to. This might perhaps be a feature of UK, even more precisely English, traditions of communication. English culture has a long tradition of pragmatism and a preference for ironic humour to pomposity. The kind of writing that really appeals to me is 'creative non-fiction'. People like Kathleen Jamie, Paul Kingsnorth, Rachel Lichtenstein, Jay Griffiths or Sukhdev Sandhu. A lot of these writers are also journalists.\u00a0\n\nI don't disrespect or want to avoid writing like a journalist, especially when I need to report an event or idea at speed.

Thank you!\n\n**Matrix multiplication**\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions from computer equipment (as well as the energy consumption of computer equipment!) comes up every now and then. Even with vastly more energy-efficient equipment, the sheer amount of equipment being deployed means energy consumption necessarily goes up. Artificial intelligence also is not helping - it does not require a lot of math and computer science to realize most of A.I. is matrix multiplications (a famously energy consuming computational problem!).\n\nIt should not require a lot of political science and legal informatics knowledge to recognise that most EU governments originally invested in computer systems to be deterministic, but have now ended up reflecting on how to use stochastic mechanisms (A.I.) to re-introduce stretchibility in governance. One reflects on why so much effort is spent on reintroducing machine-driven subjectivity, when human-driven subjectivity was the entire reason for computerization to begin with.\n\nI think - perhaps ironically - that a chronically understudied subject is *history of technology*. Many of the most insightful and illuminating texts I've come across are from this field, whether it be Vassilev Bontchevs chronicles of early virus-coding in Bulgaria (https://bontchev.nlcv.bas.bg/papers/factory.html), Jon Agars description of early conceptualizations of computerization in liberal United Kingdom (\"Government Machine\"), Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchettes book on French challenges with the immateriality of the electronic signature (\"Burdens of Proof\") or Seda G\u00fcrses thesis on privacy-enhancing technologies from 2010. Much effort is spent on emergent technologies, or emergent legal challenges arising from such technologies, and in general the present - so much so that we appear to be missing out on even relatively recent contexts (like the past century or less) that could help us find bearing and direction.\n\nA big challenge, I suggest, is that most public sector investment in information technologies is being done without a clear view of what the investments are really for (although I could well be locally biased, having been based in Sweden).\n\n**Logistics**\n\nOne place where we could start looking, even if it might be painful, is in trying to recognise where the big productivity gains have arisen as a result of information technologies. Information technologies have generated a lot of patents (see Castells or Mazzucato). But they have not, in fact, made it possible for individuals to work less - implying that the productivity gains are, generally, low. Controversially, we could hypothesize that *information technologies do not improve the economy much!* An essay with a US perspective is available here:\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/\n\nSo in spite of an increasing amount of wealth, which is circulating around fewer and fewer people (see Stieglitz, Krugman, Deaton, among others), productivity per work hour is seemingly not going up, but down. And less and less wealth is trickling downwards. \n\nThe one area that I can spontaneously imagine has really benefitted from information technologies, though, is *logistics*. Logistics has gotten easier, cheaper and productive: we can now fish shrimp in the North Sea, ship them to Thailand for boiling and peeling, ship them back to Poland for packing and then to Belgium for consumption - this would have been an impossibly gargantuan task only a few decades ago. Unfortunately it's not environmentally optimal.\n\nIt is easier to keep track of shipments, of ships, of routes, products, containers, and all other things shipping related. We would likely not have the extensive global networks of trade that we have today were it not for information technologies.\n\nIn this sense, we may have use for *history of economics*. I've heard comparisons made with electricity - what kind of productivity gains did it lead to? One was obviously keeping cities illuminated, but another was an ability to make factories smaller (vertical, in fact). Before electricity, factories took up more horizontal space. After electricity, factories could also be vertically constructed. This allowed productivity gains, compared with e.g. steam power or similar.\n\n**Foucault and centralization**\n\nI come back almost always to James Boyle's 1997 \"Foucault in cyberspace\" essay: \n\nhttps://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/619/\n\nwith the question whether the norms that we apply to information management in society do not, in fact, presume some level of centralization. Whether it be about deciding which type of information is terrorist, extreme or hateful, or about deciding when culture should or should not be shared and for what reasons, there is a presumption of an arbitrator or controller who is external to the individuals engaging with the information. The internet was built specifically not to have such arbitrators or controllers, at least not at the network layer, and so we're seeing arbitrators and controllers emerge on the higher layers instead - but it's a difficult task! It is not trivial to ensure that such a flexible and open architecture as is the internet is adapted for the presumption of a single arbitrator or controller (per political jurisdiction?).\n\nI'm personally hesitant to buy into the narratives of hate-speech at all. I have come to increasingly believe that most people simply do what their leaders do, and political leaders (world-wide) are of increasingly poor quality: they may hold press-conferences where they brag about performing an assassination on a territory with which they are not at war, call people bots and zombies, and other similar things. Perhaps it would be useful if public persons had similar restrictions on their freedom of speech as they have on their right to privacy - namely, if you are a public person, you should not expect to be able to present your thoughts as freely as if you are not a public person.", "created_at": "2019-12-21 19:51:19.562507", "updated_at": "2019-12-21 19:51:19.562507", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 956, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 49.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5698], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63074, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 11249, "post_number": 15, "raw": "@alberto the next and only opportunity to spend time collectively and work on the governance model is at the Co design sprint on 28 November, with @Sabine, @Matthias and others.\nThere was simply not enough time to go into details at the first workshop. \nWould any of you be willing to facilitate a group work then?

So, I decided to run a little test, using <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1745147?hl=en\">Content Experiments</a> to see if a dashboard-y home page leads users to contribute more content to the Edgeryders conversation. It works like this: half of us, when we hit the \"home\" button as logged-in users, will see the old home page; the other half will the dashboard. Content Experiments then runs a simple statistical test called an A-B test and determines whether one of the two variants performs better than the other, and which one.\u00a0\n\nIn the experiment I called the normal Home Page Monkey Brain, because it is based on the psychological principle of imitation.

It can be useful as a tactic for keeping skilled/familiar people in the organisation, alongside more flexibility in their roles. It could also work well in volunteer organisations, depending on the reasons volunteers fall out of course. From my experience, volunteer programmes function best with some proportion (maybe 1/4) on pay roll; those who collect feedback and develop curriculum accordingly, those who have seen the highs and lows of the operations. I think listening to feedback is the best way to ensure a culture of ongoing learning, but that doesn't necessarily mean developing the curriculum in-house; sometimes it's worth identifying where the individual can benefit from further training and sponsoring a course or suggesting a free online course. But for more specific learning about the organisation, a curriculum developed from the feedback could work.\n\nSo here's what I want to work on now (for ER, for GRDN and for Noden): a structure for documentation, so that crucial information is accessible to more than just the inner circle / leader.

How to manouvre the time commitment of reflection: both committing to writing reflection and combing through these entries to compile & propose new guidelines for the role/organisation. Is this a full-time job in itself? Data analytics with follow through.\n3. Can we represent prior knowledge visually, so anyone taking over a role has a firm understanding of how their personal strengths and weaknesses compare to their predecessor?\n\nAs for bringing new people in, the Permaculture CoLab have mentioned keeping the Form, Storm, Norm stages to the existing team and opening up to new people during Perform.

The selection aims to be representative of a wide part of society (academia, manufacturing workers, citizens as consumers\u2026) and to involve KETs applications directly linked to several of the main current societal challenges.*\n\n*A participatory multi-actor engagement process will be established, presenting practical models of engagement (from previous related projects, know-how and networking with current projects and activities), for bringing together citizens and industry in dialogue and co-creation processes around KETs and industrial technologies applications with the objective of including the citizens priorities, expectations and concerns in their development and implementation.*\n\nProject duration is 30 months, the coordinator is [EWF](https://www.ewf.be/) and other confirmed partners: [FEUGA](https://www.feuga.es/), [University of Vigo](https://www.uvigo.gal/), [University of Patras - LMS](http://lms.mech.upatras.gr/), [ENoLL](https://enoll.org/), [AIMEN](https://www.aimen.es/en) and the Finnish Network of Living Labs. We had the partners call on Wednesday during which we discussed the roles and distribution of the tasks. The proposal is that Edgeryders leads the WP4 - Society KETLab and also having a role in certain tasks in other WPs. \n\nWe offer our standard workpackage - we launch the online conversation on the topics of the working groups that will be formed in the WP2 and use the SSNA. The engagement part would consist of different activities for the living labs - workshops for citizens and other stakeholders, creating links between the society and the policymakers, and bringing people to the platform. @nadia would you have some time next week to discuss this and the budget? \n\nBy the end of the next week we need to draft the WP description and define the roles of other partners in our WP. The deadline for submission is close, 5th of February, but our methodology fits very well in the proposal and we do not have to invest too much efforts in writing the other sections which will soon be shared with us. \n\nAll documents received so far are on our (protected) [team Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1PAE-nY1JaPa3VYtvZQqSN_U77kXJ4K7W) and I will be creating the draft of our WP there as well, probably asking some of you for some feedback...if anyone is willing to invest more time with me on this, let me know! \n\n@alberto @hugi @amelia @matthias @johncoate ...", "created_at": "2020-01-17 16:53:08.913253", "updated_at": "2020-01-17 16:53:08.913253", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 538, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 137.8, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 2915, 4022, 5, 5538], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63170, "user_id": 2567, "topic_id": 10686, "post_number": 7, "raw": "I don't know if Bridegefy is encrypted but I've read an article they use it to communicate on the ground using Bluetooth to create the mesh network : http://www.bridgefy.me\n\nOne of their main discussion tool isn't Facebook (compared to 2014) but a reddit like forum https://lihkg.com/\n\nLots of other apps being used are listed here\n\u201cDigital resistance: security & privacy tips from Hong Kong protesters\u201d by Sam Aiken https://link.medium.com/5tKJv0Nko1\n\nAlso check out the Umbrella app with on the go security tips that can be applied not just for HK.", "created_at": "2019-11-06 09:39:14.916001", "updated_at": "2019-11-06 09:39:14.916001", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 99, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 81.8, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4022, 1856, 2915, 5268], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4522, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4489, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**_Available in: :gb: [English](#en) / :ar: [Arabic](#ar)_**\n\n----------\n\n## :gb: **_English version_** <a name=\"en\"></a>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HoKMgpBOAI\n                                        \n[b]Last year Edgeryders and the United Nations Development Program started collaborating around a new project in three countries: [/b]we called it Spot the Future.

We could either tour with the artworks later back to cities or organize festivals good enough to bring people from the cities to these places\n\n- developing a gamified experience for the project with our TIP students - there already is a component of a digital game, which was supposed to be developed by Ministry of Games from Finland, but there apparently was a conflict in the organization and they might not be available anymore. I found a possible replacement in my network for that already - if we want to have both types of games\n\n- the museum is supposed to \"kill\" and archive corruption as a practice - but I was also thinking of adding some forward-thinking elements to it, some kind of workshop/intervention/talk model that would allow us to imagine post-corruption futures. I think there's a need for utopian thinking and it would be a good opportunity to exercise that. \n\n- creation of the platform where stories of corruption will be collected - then some of these works will be taken by curators and artists who will turn them into \"artifacts\" - this can be done by edgeryders, we can develop a space where anyone can submit a case and then add a selection of actions people can take based on it. This could be our digital dump ;) On top of that we can create a map of corruption and its monuments, which can be used by anyone in their travels - this was inspired by corruption tours taking place in Prague. \n\nGoran would like to know if we would be up for leading the project - I said yes, but we have to agree on that. @alex_levene @noemi what do you think? Their organization is small and has a low turnover, so they can't do it. \n\nGoran is now checking with his former partners who stay in the team - Ministry of Games might be replaced by Liquid Democracy. I am scouting for 2-3 organizations that could join us as well - if anyone has ideas, let me know. \n\nLater on, we will have to assemble a team of philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, etc who will collectively develop departments and sections of the museum - this will be the first phase of the project's work - after which we will start collecting stories and then building the artworks.", "created_at": "2019-04-24 09:36:33.443680", "updated_at": "2019-04-24 12:00:31.755294", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 462, "wiki": false, "reads": 20, "score": 84.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80459, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11904, "post_number": 4, "raw": "[quote=\"MariaEuler, post:3, topic:11904\"]\nThey feel like they registered on Eventbrite and that\u2019s it.\n[/quote]\n\nDo we need Eventbrite at all?", "created_at": "2020-07-14 12:44:36.664410", "updated_at": "2020-07-14 12:44:36.664410", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 24, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 11.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [80458], "is_reply_to": [80458], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83889, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14483, "post_number": 1, "raw": "This wiki is for inventorying the components of the stack (or suite?) as they are now. \n\n\n# 1.

A small library of canned Python functions for data analysis using the Discourse APIs.\n\n* [**Rapid Social Networks**](https://github.com/albertocottica/discourse-social-networks). A [Tulip](tulip.labri.fr/) project file (called a *perspective*) that allows rapid visualization of the social networks of conversations happening on Discourse. The semantic content is ignored. \n\n    ![image|690x414](upload://oxyZH42yC64IUbzhr5hxS8hAqXc.png)\n\n* **Disgource**. Not really a software application in itself, more the use of an existing application, [Gource](https://gource.io), to represent a coded conversation on Discourse in the form of a video animation.

This could hide some demand and preserve privacy a bit more, so they can't necessarily tell when you are home based on your energy usage, etc.\n\nIt both situations (and a long time from now, barring government regulation), you could imagine smart meters only sending their daily usage on a per house basis and the energy companies getting combined usage data from substations.\n\nThis would still allow power companies to predict demand accurately.\n\nJust to let people know why I am not working on this at the moment, I haven't had much engagement from the protocol design people.

With use comes data and complexity, and that's where we start seeing some of the most interesting benefits of mapping your organization like this.\n \n![graph%20(8)%202|690x565](upload://ye4b5QIpZV9LRQ9xMDGxSSwcIFU.jpeg) \n\nPurple dots are people, blue dots are responsibilities. Green edges are of type 'realizes', meaning that the person is in charge of some responsibility. In this graph, I have manually organized the nodes and edges so that people form a circle, with the responsibilities they have clustered in front of them. Responsibilities that are currently unclaimed or lack clear ownership are the circle in the middle. I quite like this layout since it mirrors the \"tribe\" circle, with the commons in the middle \u2013 visible for anyone to step up and claim.\n\nThere are two other kinds of edges in this graph: Guides and Depends on.\n\n![graph%20(10)|690x565](upload://isIDgeh9gifynihv5sL0uLIK4Fa.jpeg) \n\nIn the graph above, the 'guides' edges have been accentuated. These edges mean that someone is very familiar with the requirements of a responsibility and could help find someone to take it on if the 'realizer' suddenly drops the ball or leaves. All responsibilities have guides per default. When you define a responsibility you become the guide for it and you cannot get out of that without finding someone else to take over. \n\n![graph%20(9)|690x565](upload://1L6eOzNl4Q1jBoEAkN0tO6R7H4O.jpeg) \n\nFinally, there are the \"depends on\" edges which show how different responsibilities depend on each other. For example, the node in close to the top-center of the outer circle has a lot of incoming and outgoing dependencies. \n\n![graph%20(9)%202|486x374](upload://fLnTrddHp16V39fS9QT8NgVHwDm.png) \n\nPeople in the organization should take note of this bottleneck and make sure the realizer of this very important responsibility has everything they ask for on time.\n\nI think there is something very interesting here that we can learn from and keep developing. I would like to write a graph algorithm that takes the data from Realities (a web application with an interface similar to a task manager, using Neo4j as its database) and displays it in this way: People forming an outer circle, their direct responsibilities right in front of them and unclaimed responsibilities in the middle. I can already get the graphdata into the front end in a format that for example Vis.js understands, so what I need is to write the clustering algorithm and implement it with the graph drawing library.\n\nThose among you with insights into the world of graph algorithms, where should I start?

I\u2019ve tried to imagine an accounting approach that can integrate impact. I refer to this as Triple Entry Bookkeeping, and published a sci-fi paper exploring the concept, see http://www.sumptuousaccounting.org/\n\nAnswering the [questions from the website](https://scifieconomicslab.net/#call):\n\n> &nbsp;1. Who you are (one paragraph).\n\nKarl H Richter \u2013 is the Executive Director and Co-Founder of EngagedX, which is a specialist consulting company in the field of social impact investing. It focuses on thought leadership, research, product development, advocacy, and policy. Karl is an advisor to the ixo Foundation, the China Alliance of Social Value Investment, and the Global Value Exchange; and a guest lecturer at Oxford University Sa\u00efd Business School for the executive training programmes on impact management and social impact investing. Karl recently served a 12 month assignment as Head of Research and Knowledge at the United Nations SDG Impact Finance initiative (UNSIF), where he focused on launching its research agenda and establishing principles for SDG impact management and certification. Previously he led the OECD\u2019s data standardisation work-stream on social impact investing, covering financial and impact performance reporting as well as market segmentation; was a Member of the European Commission\u2019s expert group on social entrepreneurship (GECES); led the production of the global-first financial benchmark for social impact investing (featured as exemplar by the OECD to the G7); was appointed by the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre to develop a meta-framework for impact management; frequent conference speaker, including invitation by the US Secretary of State as plenary speaker for the Global Impact Economy Forum at the US State Department.\n\n> &nbsp;2. Why you are interested in being part of the Science Fiction Economics Lab (two paragraphs).\n\nI hope my sci-fi writing on the topic aligns with what you\u2019re trying to achieve, and I would love to debate the concepts with people exploring similar ideas http://www.sumptuousaccounting.org/ ... it uses the sci-fi genre and a story-telling narrative to explore a utopian vision for fixing capitalism. This approach was taken because sci-fi allows us the creativity to explore an alternative reality. It frees us from preconceptions and the inertia of habit. However, sci-fi is also rooted in practical feasibility - it is not fantasy.\n\nThis thought experiment allows us to ask: 'if our socio-economic construct was different - how could capitalism be improved?'\n\n> &nbsp;3. What you would like to work on (maximum four paragraphs).\n\nFixing capitalism through designing an accounting system that can integrate impact, both positive and negative. See paper via URL above.\n\n> &nbsp;4. Whether you plan to be in Brussels on November 11-12 2019 for the Lab\u2019s maiden voyage.\n\nNot sure yet - but I would love to!\n\n--\n\nLook forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest\nKarl", "created_at": "2019-11-06 21:39:13.392368", "updated_at": "2019-11-13 00:04:11.989167", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 489, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 48.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 4892], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69741, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 12482, "post_number": 12, "raw": "Thursday works for me.

In general, the switch to XML has rendered obsolete part of the documentation.\n[/quote]\n\nI would add this - there should be a clear distinction between the [Open Source project](https://erwebkit.netlify.app) and the Edgeryders version. The two are mostly the same, but there are some important differences:\n\n1. The Edgeryders API behaves a little differently from a vanilla installation of Discourse. James built useful endpoints for fetching content - for example, for [fetching topics](http://edgeryders.eu/webkit_components/topics.json?categories=tell-us-about-you&serializer=event). These endpoints should not (and are not) used in the Open Source project, as they will not work with any other Discourse installation.\n\n2. The Edgeryders Webkit hosted at [live.edgeryders.eu](http://live.edgeryders.eu) has a 'multi-site' configuration. This means one installation is the 'backend' for many sites - and these sites are routed through different domains or aliases (in our case [defined here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-webkit-directory/13671)). \n\nAfter the XML syntax, this is the second significant change made in the last few weeks. \n\nThe benefit of using a single installation means: \n- Updates are deployed across all sites instantly\n- We reduce overhead by only having one repository to maintain (versus many dozens, one for each site), \n- We can easily use something like [Netlify Analytics](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/) to get visitor stats from all the sites at once.\n\n3. The form component, which we are still trying to integrate with the platform, requires significant customisation on the Discourse end ([this was done by Matthias, James and Hugi](https://edgeryders.eu/t/bounty-for-developing-edgeryders-form-interface/11022)) - and so is not standard with the open source project for now.\n\nThe final point, being this:\n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:1, topic:13916\"]\n**The documentation now serves much more third-party users of the webkit than people in Edgeryders** .\n[/quote]\n\nI agree and that needs to be updated.. I think the XML syntax serves project managers (and myself) better than the JSON syntax, it reads like HTML and is a lot closer to writing a post on Discourse, with the use of some additional tags. \n\nThe end result is still JSON, but that part is now behind the scenes and does not require a project manager to learn. It's far easier to write this with fewer errors:\n\n```\n<Content>\n  <Text style=\"color: red\">\n    Hello\n  </Text>\n</Content>\n```\n\nThan this:\n\n```\n\"blocks\": {\n \"content\": {\n   \"text\": \"hello\",\n   \"style\": {\n     \"color\": \"red\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nJSON is very picky with trailing commas, missing quotation marks or closing curly braces (and the more of them you have, the higher the risk of error). It's an error prone format for what we are trying to do, which is easily deploy sites with minimal trouble.\n\nSo, this needs to be properly documented - [probably here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/webkit-manual/13594) and will do it next.\n\n---\n\nAgree that themes are also very important, for the same reason as mentioned before: using a small set of CSS themes makes updating and improving the look of dozens sites a lot easier than updating one site at a time. At the moment we have two basic themes: \n\n- The very simple default theme, used here: [http://research.edgeryders.eu](http://research.edgeryders.eu)\n- The magazine-like theme used for events, campaigns and newsletters, example [here](https://live.edgeryders.eu/13832)\n\n---\n\nOverall I'm happy with the direction the Webkit is taking and more comfortable with people using it in this form than the previous iteration.. \n\nIn terms of project development, the main hurdles are (in reverse order of difficulty & time needed):\n\n- Getting the form component to work with the platform (this has been very challenging)\n- Parsing the XML tags for all the Views (slides, grids, lists, events..)\n- A blog view for displaying topics\n- Documentation:\n  - How to use the XML tags\n  - How to use a theme\n  - How to configure a form\n  - How to style individual elements\n  - How to set up an alias and domain", "created_at": "2020-06-19 18:15:54.945715", "updated_at": "2020-06-19 19:08:04.027004", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 692, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 12.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [79204], "is_reply_to": [79204], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58275, "user_id": 5300, "topic_id": 10596, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![Warszawa%2C_Marsz_Niepodleg%C5%82os%CC%81ci_2011_28|690x461](upload://otVhEXhN2uYM6JZ0Ebeo1KY5ulI.jpeg) \n\n**Jakie mam podej\u015bcie do policji?**\n\nNiekt\u00f3rzy moi towarzysze, moje towarzyszki, siedz\u0105 w wi\u0119zieniach.

Tak samo dzia\u0142aj\u0105 wielkie korporacje - jednych wyzyskuj\u0105c, a wspieraj\u0105c inne mniejszo\u015bci dla poprawy swojego wizerunku. Dlatego anarchi\u015bci organizuj\u0105 w\u0142asne marsze, odcinaj\u0105c si\u0119 od tego, co nazywamy liberalizmem. \n\nWracaj\u0105c do policji, to owszem, gdyby jej nie by\u0142o to w Bia\u0142ymstoku, by nas zabili. Ale to dlatego, \u017ce tak w tej chwili wygl\u0105da nasze spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo. Generalnie edukujemy ludzi, \u017ce lepiej liczy\u0107 na siebie, na wsp\u00f3lnot\u0119, ni\u017c odda\u0107 si\u0119 w \u0142ask\u0119/nie\u0142ask\u0119 policji. Policja robi tyle, ile musi. Jak w Bia\u0142ymstoku, gdzie kilkana\u015bcie metr\u00f3w od miejsca, gdzie ko\u0144czy\u0142 si\u0119 marsz, zaczyna\u0142y si\u0119 \u0142apanki. To nie by\u0142o w ich interesie. Zrobili swoje. A kibice Jagielloni urz\u0105dzali sobie pogaduszki z policjantami. Widzia\u0142em z jak\u0105 nienawi\u015bci\u0105 patrzyli na nas policjanci. Spory procent policjant\u00f3w np. w Stanach, to przemocowcy domowi. W Polsce \u015bmia\u0142o mo\u017cna powiedzie\u0107, \u017ce co drugi policjant ma sympatie nacjonalistyczne.  Przecie\u017c to koledzy ze stadion\u00f3w. \n\n**Jak stworzy\u0107 spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo, w kt\u00f3rym Policja nie b\u0119dzie potrzebna?** \n\nWidzia\u0142em na oczy takie miejsca. Miejsca gdzie istnieje stra\u017c s\u0105siedzka, obywatelska. Jeste\u015bmy za tym, \u017ceby pa\u0144stwa by\u0142o jak najmniej, a najlepiej, \u017ceby go w og\u00f3le nie by\u0142o. Chodzi nam o to, \u017ceby ludzie odpowiadali za siebie i pilnowali si\u0119 nawzajem, a nie oddawali to w r\u0119ce pa\u0144stwa. \u017beby\u015bmy tworzyli spo\u0142eczno\u015bci, kt\u00f3re nie czekaj\u0105 na w\u0142adze, kt\u00f3ra powie im jak \u017cy\u0107. Za ka\u017cdym razem kiedy kto\u015b dostaje w\u0142adz\u0119, staje si\u0119 skorumpowany. \n\n**Sk\u0105d u mnie taka postawa?**\n\nTo wynik rozczarowania. Obiecywano nam po sko\u0144czeniu studi\u00f3w z\u0142ote g\u00f3ry. \u017be je\u015bli tylko si\u0119 naprawd\u0119 przy\u0142o\u017cymy, \u017ce jak b\u0119dziemy wstawa\u0107 bardzo wcze\u015bnie rano, to wszystko b\u0119dzie \u015bwietnie. To k\u0142amstwo. Pracownik korporacji od robotnika nie r\u00f3\u017cni si\u0119 niczym. Nie ma czego\u015b takiego jak klasa \u015brednia. To jaki\u015b mit maj\u0105cy odwr\u00f3ci\u0107 uwag\u0119 od tego, \u017ce jeden zarabia 100 tysi\u0119cy, a drugi, nawet je\u015bli jakim\u015b cudem zarobi 10 tysi\u0119cy, to on dalej jest tylko wyrobnikiem. Te nier\u00f3wno\u015bci spo\u0142eczne s\u0105 straszne. Poza tym mamy dwie fale nacjonalizm\u00f3w w Polsce. Pierwsza lat 90 i teraz. Ja nie wierz\u0119 w rozwi\u0105zania systemowe. Nie ma innej metody na pokonanie nacjonalizm\u00f3w jak eliminacja ich z przestrzeni publicznej, \u0142\u0105cznie z u\u017cyciem si\u0142y fizycznej. Nie ma innej metody. \u017badna ustawa tego nie za\u0142atwi. Oficjalnie organizacje neonazistowskie s\u0105 zakazane w Polsce. Po pierwsze trzeba usun\u0105\u0107 ca\u0142kowicie ich przekaz. To libera\u0142owie dopu\u015bcili, \u017ce faszy\u015bci byli mile widziani, np. w telewizji \u015bniadaniowej. To w\u0142a\u015bnie libera\u0142owie zrobili z tego ciekawostk\u0119 do poczytania w weekendowym wydaniu. Oni wpu\u015bcili ich z powrotem. To ju\u017c nie jest faszyzm lat 90, dzi\u015b to s\u0105 panowie w garniturkach., kt\u00f3rzy \u0142adnie m\u00f3wi\u0105. \n\nPolitycy odegrali tak\u017ce swoj\u0105 rol\u0119 tutaj na fali nienawi\u015bci do uchod\u017ac\u00f3w. Ta nienawi\u015b\u0107 wysz\u0142a na ulice i wesz\u0142a do mainstreamu i teraz typowy nastolatek jest nacjonalist\u0105 o patriot\u0105. Dlatego trzeba usuwa\u0107 ich z debaty publicznej. Nie wolno ich z nimi rozmawia\u0107. \u017badnej rozmowy! Usuwa\u0107 wszystko co si\u0119 z nimi kojarzy. A po trzecie przegania\u0107 ich z ulic. To jest wojna. Oni chc\u0105 nas pozabija\u0107 i otwarcie o tym m\u00f3wi\u0105, wi\u0119c po co ich zaprasza\u0107 i pyta\u0107 co oni o tym s\u0105dz\u0105. Jak sobie tutaj mo\u017cna w og\u00f3le wyobrazi\u0107 kompromis? \u017be b\u0119dziemy zabija\u0107 gej\u00f3w tylko we wtorki? Obecnie nam liberalizm kojarzy si\u0119 z demokratycznym pa\u0144stwem, zachodnim, powi\u0105zanym z Uni\u0105 Europejsk\u0105 o kapitalistycznym ustroju gospodarczym. Dla nas to jest tak samo z\u0142e jak wszystko inne, mo\u017ce tylko bardziej kolorowe. Te sojusze s\u0105 zawierane z konieczno\u015bci. Anarchizm kiedy\u015b by\u0142 bardziej popularny ni\u017c dzi\u015b i liczono si\u0119 z tym ruchem w Polsce. Ale rozczarowanie partiami lewackimi ro\u015bnie, a to dla nas tylko lepiej. \n\nNie wyssa\u0142em tego z mlekiem matki. Moi rodzice byli zadowoleni ze zmian, kt\u00f3re zachodz\u0105 w Polsce. Ale ja mam inaczej. Fajnie jest co\u015b robi\u0107 i widzie\u0107 efekty swojej pracy. Np. taka akcja, \u017ce wydajemy posi\u0142ki bezdomnym. To dzia\u0142a. Jest ca\u0142a masa dzia\u0142a\u0144: prowadzenie bibliotek, kurs\u00f3w dla dzieci, zbi\u00f3rki, po blokowanie korporacji na targach i pa\u0142owanie faszyst\u00f3w. Du\u017co tego. U mnie zacz\u0119\u0142o si\u0119 w sumie od muzyki. Na osiedlu byli albo naziole, albo punkowcy i dla mnie jako\u015b naturalnie wysz\u0142o, \u017ce nie przepada\u0142em za nazistami i tak ju\u017c zosta\u0142o. Sko\u0144czy\u0142em studia stosunki mi\u0119dzynarodowe. Nie\u017ale sobie radz\u0119. Nie mam najgorzej. Pracuj\u0119 w korpo.\n\nNajbardziej frustruje mnie obecnie to, co Polakom wt\u0142acza si\u0119 do g\u0142\u00f3w, i jak oni to bezrefleksyjnie \u0142ykaj\u0105. Wszystkie te pierdo\u0142y pod tytu\u0142em \u201eSzwecji ju\u017c nie ma\u201d, \u201eImigrant zjad\u0142 dziecko\u201d, \u201eIdeologia gender\u201d itd. Te prymitywne tre\u015bci mocno do ludzi trafiaj\u0105, a p\u00f3\u017aniej ci\u0119\u017cko si\u0119 z tym walczy.  Czyli pranie m\u00f3zg\u00f3w ludzi. \n\nMarzy mi si\u0119, \u017ceby odwr\u00f3ci\u0142a si\u0119 ta prawacka tendencja, kt\u00f3ra trwa ju\u017c jaki\u015b czas. Chcia\u0142bym, \u017ceby zrobi\u0142o si\u0119 normalniej. Nie dyskwalifikuje nacjonalist\u00f3w jako ludzi, dajmy im szanse popracowa\u0107 z bezdomnymi, z uchod\u017acami, niech przejrz\u0105 na oczy. Mo\u017ce wtedy co\u015b zrozumiej\u0105. Taki przeci\u0119tny tzw. nacjonalista ma\u0142o co rozumie. Za tym stoj\u0105 mafie narkotykowe. A dla nich nie widz\u0119 w og\u00f3le miejsca w \u017cadnym spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwie. \n\nAle jest coraz lepiej, nawet tych cholernych marsz\u00f3w jest coraz wi\u0119cej.

Are you confortable making use of the lessons learned from temporary-ness and look into designing for more safety and longevity? If so, the groups we would involve might include, but definitely not be limited to people working in that space. An example: Imagine policy makers currently involved in the temporary occupation debate, but approached with a proposal to point us to opportunities for long term use, or concession, or similar. \n\nAnother question is: how would you go about finding which could be interesting spaces in the city with *some* access (whether they are private or publicly owned)? Would it build on the work of Commune St Vide/ Leegbeek or other mapping efforts? For the purpose of this scouting exercise, we'd need to identify some of them in order to be able to imagine how a community could live there and what kind of green projects would be needed or suitable. \nThis is exploratory ground, so the farther we can get the better, but even identifying a starting point would be useful.\n\nOtherwise, I think we should meet as soon as you are available!", "created_at": "2019-08-20 12:42:39.953573", "updated_at": "2019-08-20 12:42:39.953573", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 252, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 28.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [58169], "is_reply_to": [58169], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48912, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9203, "post_number": 13, "raw": "[quote=\"anique.yael, post:12, topic:9203\"]\nAcknowledging certain miscalculations on my part, it seems that one of the challenges we have in this current situation is the blurriness in a number of these tasks. I am not yet sure how to go about resolving this. From the above it seems you are saying that these additional tasks should be taken care of by those team leaders whose work most closely fits. Is that correct?\n[/quote]\n\n\nNo, not necessarily. In my \"fly fishing\" example (stolen from Alberto Rey) I tried to make a hypothetical case for an activity that none of the extant team leaders would know how to do. In that case, as the proposal gets written, we would look for someone who can do that and negotiate KPIs with that person (\"Alberto, can you do three expeditions, with 15 children each, for 5K EUR?\"). \n\nWhat I _am_ saying is that we should attempt to maximize synergies between activities, rather than dividing them up. Sometimes, of course, total separation will make sense. We did not have to this explicitly for the SSNA package _because we relied on previous experience dating back to 2012_, and so we (including team leaders in \"we\") already knew how these activities feed into each other. For example, I might organize small online seminars to share SSNA results, and ask Nadia and Noemi to push it out to the community and do some follow-up to encourage people to give us feedback. \n\nHow do we maximize synergies? I am not sure, it's an open question. The first thing that comes to mind is calling up team leaders and asking the question. \"Partner X asks if we can do anything about environmental education, any idea?\" Or, if you and I already had something in mind: \"We agreed with partner X that we could do something about environmental education that would help their work. We were thinking about involving Alberto Rey and his fly fishing thing. What do you think?\" This would be the point where people would come up with ideas, their proposed role in them (that could also be: no ideas, no role, total separation is fine, go ahead with it any way you want). In the case of the impact conference, its impact in term of everything we do is significant, and so it makes even more sense at least to run it past people. \"Blurriness\" is neither possible nor desirable to eliminate, unless the project gets schizophrenic. We can manage it, more or less, by dialogue plus do-ocracy, aka \"collective intelligence\". \n\nFor the record: I do not think you, @anique.yael, or anyone else, did anything fundamentally \"wrong\". This is one of these things that we never had to think about before as we worked as a smaller team made tight by years of working together. We might even _not_ need any specific process to deal with this stuff, just a bit of common sense and an attention to minimize drama.

I think it is interesting because it gives me the chance to explain better how these consortia are coming together, and how we can navigate them.\n\nIn essence: @rachel and @winnieponcelet are both providing input. Both see themselves in the consortium. But, so far, only Winnie's Biofabrication Forum is listed as a partner, whereas Rachel's Hackuarium is not. What gives?\n\nHere's what gives: consortia come together as a sort of coordination game. Almost never does one partner have all the necessary resources of expertise, administrative solidity, impressiveness of brand, political clout etc. to win alone, no matter who else gets involved. In general, you need to go about this job by securing these resources from different people. \n\nIn CCCP-SSSR there is a sort of two-pronged leadership. ER is itself one of the prongs. But it is not the consortium coordinator. Reason: as a new company, we would never pass the financial validation that coordinating partners must pass. Second reason: we are not that experienced at this game, and we want someone else to help build a \"pitch perfect\" partnership and proposal, someone who has better intelligence into the Commission than we have. This someone is the [Lisbon Council](http://www.lisboncouncil.net/). I know them well, and trust them. \n\nThey have pointed out that this partnership is very interdisciplinary, so it needs partners who can stand guard at each ingredient in the mix. But then, it becomes big and unwieldy (9 partners already), raising coordination costs. We cannot justify two partners in the same area, they say. I agree, and anyway they have last word in strategic matters.\n\nSo, I propose three solutions and a reflection. The solutions:\n\n1. Replace Biofab Forum with Hackarium.\n\n2. Have Biofab Forum hire Hackuarium people to participate in the project (or the other way around). Or give fellowships, even: this is how we ourselves tried to support Reagent during 2017 (and Woodbine and GalGael).\n\n3. Hackuarium and/or Biofab Forum dig out some other funding opportunity, where we apply with some variant of CCCP. We would be happy to participate, helping out with the writing etc. \n\nDo you see any of them as viable?\n\nThe reflection is this. We are doing our best to dream up new and better ways that all of us, as a community, can support ourselves and the work. In Edgeryders core we are happy to take on some of the heavy lifting of doing the intel work (@anique.yael) , sitting in meetings (Anique again)  and writing concept notes and proposals (mostly me). But that does not mean we can wave our magic wand and make things happen. Expecting this will only lead to frustration. We have no magic wands, only shovels, and we are shoveling as hard as we can. \n\nSo, what can you do to make the most out of it? I would say two things. First: try to copy what we are doing in your own space. As I said above, we are happy to help you put together a proposal in which you would be leading and we would be supporting. We will not stop looking for opportunities, so the net result will be that the everyone in the research network will be looking out for opportunities for the whole network \u2013 more shoveling. And the result of _that_ is risk reduction and more revenue to go around. \n\nAnd second: try to keep in mind that this is unpaid work for Edgeryders. Treat it as a friendly gesture (about 40% of our labor costs go to non-Edgeryders directors); even if it does not go all the way you want to go, it still is made in love, and hopefully still has a positive sign.  \n\nMakes sense?", "created_at": "2018-02-28 21:47:51.640635", "updated_at": "2019-03-07 23:44:31.859842", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 655, "wiki": false, "reads": 27, "score": 80.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4265], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16397, "user_id": 1190, "topic_id": 1700, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Services and Expansion of Them</b>\n\nI like the idea of using unMonks to translate the web site of the comune into English.

Always environmentally focussed, broadly in care.\n \nEngineering Comes Home ask the question of \u201cHow can communities of non experts be involved with infrastructure designers to make infrastructures that meet their needs?\u201d It is in development as a co-design toolkit for new infrastructure design (food, energy, waste, water). It brings together ethnography, workshop practice and rapid prototyping. It is mainly aimed at citizens and infrastructure designers. The project is realised in collaboration between iilab, University College London and Newcastle University.\n \nAmong other things, we developed a prototype \u201ccalculator\u201d to measure environmental impact to look at the possible resources people can steward in their neighbourhood.\n \nThe first iteration of the project was done with one community in London, with good results in terms of infrastructure outcomes and satisfaction and feedback from community stakeholders. We gained insights into involving citizens in a complex subject matter and increasing their over their stake in it. A first implementation of rainwater stewardship has been installed in collaboration with KloudKeeper, and during the final workshop we came up with a plan for increasing the scope of rainwater stewardship by the community that can move forward with minimal support from the ECH team.\n \nVital is a collection of processes to interrogate our relationship with food. Delivered as a series of workshops, techniques include DIY micronutrient analysis as well as mindful eating (eg. aesthetic experience), forum theatre and foraging. The process ends with participants co-creating installations and interventions for an exhibition that synthesises these perspectives on food, allowing participants to explore what sparks their interest to create something new and internalise the knowledge. \n \nIn the first iteration of the project, preliminary feedback shows that engagement with these processes has changed the attitudes of the participants towards food. The group of young people who participated started out caring only about the calorie content of food. After seven weeks their attitudes had changed and they were reflecting on their personal eating habits, cultural and aesthetic aspects of eating, as well as bringing to the fore social and financial inequalities that affect the availability of different food, which emerged from the participants\u2019 drawing on everyday life experience. Next up is a collaboration with a DIY spectrometer project to measure better micronutrient content. The aim is not to measure toxins, but to make a deeper appreciation for food and the environment.\n\nI\u2019m a big believer in experiential and collaborative working to create change. This is part of the design in the projects and art work. All these projects are open source, with documentation being put online over the summer. \n\nDuring a session I would share experiences and showcase these projects, and if there\u2019s interest I can also demo a workshop from ECH or Vital. \n\nIf people are excited about it, we can adapt the infrastructure co-design toolkit during a longer workshop, so that it can be used for different communities to co-design their infrastructure/living environment. I\u2019d also like to discuss opportunities to roll Vital out more widely around the globe.\n\nAlongside the specifics of these projects, I\u2019d also like to discuss strategies to make these kinds of projects self-sustainable. For instance, a few years ago I participated in an Edgeryders conference with the Open Droplet project. The goal was a device to non-invasively measure water flow. The data was owned by consumers, rather than companies. It led to lobbying for more open data and community stewardship of resources within UK water policy. The project is now on hold as it didn\u2019t find a way to get the required funding, though it morphed a little into the Engineering Comes Home project. I\u2019d like to explore funding more with others during the festival, drawing on discussions I\u2019ve been having with other DIY science pracitioners.\n \nAnother issue is how to disseminate outputs of projects, like exhibits, conferences etc. It\u2019s a lot of work and feels like a drop in the ocean sometimes. It\u2019s hard to reach central actors like the European Commission or other government, who can create real change, which is the goal.", "created_at": "2017-07-25 11:56:44.118040", "updated_at": "2017-09-19 13:49:53.952210", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 696, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 139.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 3362], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80208, "user_id": 4640, "topic_id": 14048, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Hi, Alberto-\n\nSure, I have been aware of Kelton and MMT for a while. It is a variation of what Milton Friedman called \"helicopter money\" in his 1969 \"The Optimum Quantity of Money\", but Friedman didn't think much of it -- that fell to Willem Buiter in his 2003 \"Helicopter Money: Irredeemable Fiat Money and the Liquidity Trap Or Is Money Net Wealth After All?\", which I highly recommend (https://www.willembuiter.com/helinber.pdf).\n\nIt seems to me that Helicopter Money of one kind or another is a very useful tool in a downturn or when there is significant slack capacity, but otherwise it is money, and as such if there is too much of it chasing too few goods it causes inflation, which degrades the value of the currency.\n\nThat said, I don't want to denigrate the value of this kind of intervention. I have been advocating it for a while. As you know, in Japan in the 80s, then after the Financial Crisis in the US in 2008, then in Europe after the Eurozone Crisis of 2010, Quantitative Easing (QE) was practiced. QE involves the central bank buying large quantities of, in this case in the US, mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds. This increases demand for those securities and raises their value, which stabilizes the  markets. The money used for these transactions was not newly created money, due to inflation concerns, but was \"sterilized\" by the central bank starting to pay commercial banks interest to hold funds at central bank branches, essentially paying them to keep money out of circulation. This kind of action is good in a crisis, but it had the negative side-effect of raising the incomes of holders of bonds, who are mostly rich people, and increasing inequality. What it does not do is put money in regular people's pockets when they need it after a downturn that is no fault of theirs.\n\nGeorge W. Bush in June 2008 paid all taxpayers $600 each. This was supposed to stimulate the economy and short-circuit the incipient recession. It obviously did not, because of the complications of mortgage-backed securities (oops). Congress and Mr Trump have now built on that experience by paying $1,200 to every taxpayer, along with propping up many employers. This has has the result of reducing unemployment from 14.7% in April to 13.3% in March. This is starting to look more like Helicopter Money, and it is having a positive effect, albeit at great cost ($2 trillion). The difference, of course, is that it is not newly created money.\n\nModern Monetary Theory (MMT) is predicated on the basis that under certain conditions new money can be issued without significant risk of inflation. Given our experience so far, that looks increasingly possible, but it is highly advisable to be cautious about the constraints: the economy should have significant slack, only a modest amount of money should be issued -- basically enough to reinvigorate demand for labor, politically correct investments should be avoided in favor of investment in projects that have sound commercial justification (real demand),the program should be stopped once the economy has recovered. They would also need to observe the limitations you mentioned: monetary sovereignty, etc. This looks like it might be best if it were more modest than billed by people like Bernie Sanders and similar populists like Jeremy Corbin, because of course they are politicians who are trying to get votes.\n\nIn any project which involves large-scale government intervention, a very big issue should be oversight. This is certainly as true for left-oriented projects as for those on the right -- there is a long long string of countries that have gone bankrupt as a result of politicization of handing \"free\" money out, from the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela to Pakistan and Sri Lanka and various African countries as well as examples in rich countries -- one can go on and on. I realize that Kelton talks about not issuing debt in someone else's currency in order to avoid this, but the inflation that would eventually ensue if a great deal of new money was created ends up in a similar situation. Independent oversight by an independent balanced group of experts with resources and authority and conservative instincts is key and rarely included, because this is the point, right? A slush fund for pet projects!\n\nFunding least common denominator jobs is very expensive. India has such a program -- the only way they can afford it is to make it pretty unattractive (day labor) and attach conditions that discourage people from applying. Andrew Yang's Universal Basic Income (UBI) of $12,000/yr for all Americans doesn't sound like much -- and it isn't -- but it would have cost several trillion dollars. Here is a pretty objective analysis, in my view (https://taxfoundation.org/andrew-yang-value-added-tax-universal-basic-income/). Moreover, Yang wanted to have his UBI REPLACE current welfare benefits -- this is how he keeps the cost down -- but this means poor people often see a DECREASE in their income as a result of this program -- not a great advertisement, unless you are a member of the middle class, who would be the greatest beneficiaries.\n\nI'm a fan of C. H. Douglas' Social Credit Theory -- the part where he advocates levying a tax on the use of capital which has been built using previously invented technology. It strikes me as having a reasonable theoretical and philosophical foundation -- that this capital is making income because of inventions that are now in the \"public domain\", and the value of this public intellectual property should accrue to the public. Forget all the rest of Social Credit, which gets weird and cranky, but this idea has merit -- Bill Gates has proposed a \"technology tax\" that seems to me not unrelated but is not nearly as soundly based. By the way, Robert Heinlein's first novel, written in 1939 but not published until after his death, \"For Us The Living\", is one of those talky idea-based scifi novels (that's why it wasn't published) built around this concept (instead of the libertarianism for which Heinlein is known -- that is why Heinlein himself never published it). It is Heinlein, though, so it is readable, though the relations between the sexes are as ever cringe-worthy...\n\nThe thing about Social Credit in this form is that it is a justification for a sustainable UBI, which would be based on existing production, instead of when necessary creating value out of nothing. If the theory is correct, and if in fact Social Credit does not slow production, because the capital on which it is based is a form of economic \"rent\" -- income in excess of its true added value to productivity -- then building an economy around Social Credit could potentially work. No non-producing entity -- even a government -- can produce value from nothing, so trying to use MMT as a constant tool of policy instead of an infrequent intervention is in my view a recipe for disaster.", "created_at": "2020-07-10 06:26:29.378768", "updated_at": "2020-07-10 06:37:13.516793", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1185, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 31.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70429, "user_id": 6312, "topic_id": 12680, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Thank you Maria so kind.

Wrap around and heat with a lighter, 80% of repairs can be done in an instant. It is not the prime choice for difficult load bearing issues though, more of a fixer.\n\n6. Need something to stick the PV panels onto? Rotorblade. Bolt & tie them down standing and they're out of low shade.\nHang them horizontally (and allow to rotate) and you can follow the sund.\n\nIn general looking at the large open roof: put two blades together at the roots and raise them above the building and you have you load bearing structure to attach ETFE film to.

What are you working on and why are you on the Internet Days?**\n\nMy boss sent me here. I'm a librarian.\n\nI take care of the internet drop-in in the library. I teach people about the internet and how to integrate online. How they can find things. I try to anonymize what it is they want to know. What to find out online. Trying to teach them technology, how to use the internet. Use the right tools.\n\nI use the internet for streaming myself. You come home from work and sit on the couch and stream. Or social media. Finding out things. I also learn and use learning platforms. It is a clear part of learning.\n\n**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**\n\nIt may be a little apocalyptic, but exciting when Snowden came out. It was really interesting. You knew about it, but you still got it as a shit-sandwich in the face.\n\nI take it a bit as it comes, because I can't teach what doesn't already exist. Concentrate on what is right now and take it as it comes.\n\nWhat gives the most benefit to people is when help teaching people to fill out forms for government agencies. Or if they have received a new cellphone in Christmas gift you can show them. The new technology needs to be constantly displayed. How to pay bills, for example. Many people do not understand internet banking. Then I get to learn all the systems as well.\n\nNo one has asked about Bitcoin in the library, but some people I know have asked me about it. I have just passed them along to someone else.\n\nI'm not on bitcoin. My husband is, he has a whole server in the basement that sounds like an airplane. All cabinets that glow and flash. That's his area, he has to take care of it.\n\nI haven't gotten there yet. It feels like I haven't taken in that part, because it already exists with him.\n\n**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**\n\nIt always does. It's always like, \"No, what's this?\"\n\nVery often.\n\nYou have put a piece of tape over the webcam. I have that on mine too. Read an article about building AI to make a god. All people online are part of God, they say. That's why you create God when you take all the data. I thought that sounded creepy. An interesting article. Can't remember who wrote it.\n\nAt the library, they always wonder why you have to have a google account. It is for google to know what you are doing. That's what it looks like today.\n\nSome things they need to have an account for it to work. My apple ID, why do I have to have it? It's easier if you get a login. You must have accounts in many places to proceed. They do not think this is very fun, when I tell them: \u201cit's just because they want to know everything about you.

I consider those as least energy/investment demanding though. If we are to build such a community anywhere, it's a huge boost to have such infrastructure...for construction and development above all. It also allows for those initial groups to be smaller and less specialised in those fields.\nIt is especially important if it is young urban enthusiasts who don't really have the knowledge/haven't worked on moving to the countryside for few years like me or you who made a self sustainable home in an old truck (if i remember correctly) hehehe.\n \nFor your 5th point: well I believe it varies greatly from place to place so we can't really know until we get there and try getting things done :slight_smile: \nThat's why I am not going out of EU at the moment. If I am to start it somewhere, I want it to be a familiar ground, both in terms of laws and culture/mentality :slight_smile:.

Thus moving away from only scrutinising company/organisation level behaviour in tech.\nI believe danah boyd's speech last week at the EFF is also very pertinent in this regard: http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2019/09/15/facing-the-great-reckoning-head-on.html\n\nAs to your question about who is in tech? \nI'm not sure I am, in the sense I don't necessarily create code, hardware or some such.

With increased mobility within countries and between them, and property prices rising constantly, more and more people can't afford to own their own place. Student dorms, renting a house or an apartment together, couch surfing or crashing at a friend's place, artist communities, communes and squatting spots: many of us live(d), for shorter or longer times, with others.\n\nIf you are unlucky, then your home becomes a place where you don't feel comfortable. \nIf you were one of the lucky ones that found their crowd, you can attest to the power of a nurturing and supportive community. The people who you live with can become your friends, almost as a chosen family. \n \n\n**What if you wanted to create the best conditions for living together? That is what we, Edgeryders, set up to do, and we need your help defining this space.**\n \n\nWe have tried co-living before, at a smaller scale, so we have our ideas about how we would like this community-powered space to look like. We are trying to find likeminded people, meet them, and talk to them about their vision of an ideal communal living space.\n\n\n## Enter The Reef. \n\nWe imagine the Reef as a new kind of living space that is affordable for anyone. It is a future residential space where inhabitants have individual apartments and privacy, but share common spaces like kitchens, living rooms, and office(s). The space will offer rich opportunities for rewarding and ecologically meaningful activities, and inhabitants are free to initiate and participate in what interests them most. Examples include growing and cooking food together, organizing neighbourhood activities and reducing the household's plastic waste.\n\n\n## What's the plan?\n\nWe are looking to acquire and recondition a building in Brussels, Belgium, for 20 people to live in. It will be comprised of private rooms, apartments and studios, and converted into a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions space. People will buy and/or rent together at a below-market price, depending on the ownership status of the building. The community will design the many ways to use the space in accordance to individual &amp; common needs, as well as technical and social activities to start reducing the collective carbon footprint: research green building technologies, energy storage solutions, food production, responsible consumption, and many others.\n\nOver time, this community will become a testing ground for energy/waste reduction and circular economy solutions, paving the way for many other collectives out there who wish to go green and live more affordably at the same time.\n\n## The Reef Community starts now with 3 workshops to discover one another.\n\nIf you are living in Brussels or plan to move here and like what you read so far, if you&rsquo;re thinking to change the way you live, access and share prosperity, this is an opportunity to figure it out with others. Building relationships of trust takes time, so the sooner we know each other, the better!\n\nCome to The Reef Community Workshops, where we will share:\n\n1. How can we live with others in a shared property? 24 October 18:00 - 21:00 at LaMAB, Rue de l&rsquo;association 16, 1000 Brussels ([see how it went](https://edgeryders.eu/t/reflections-from-the-reef-workshop-living-together/11249)).\n\n2. **How can we live green when living with others?** - 14 November 18:00 - 21:00 at AlleeduKaai,  Avenue du Port 53, 1000 Brussels\n\n3. **Sprint to The Reef: Co-Design session** - 28 November 16:00 - 21:00 at Metrolab, Quai du Commerce, 48, 1000 Brussels\n\n**Register below, in either English or French, the two languages of the workshops**:\n- [SIGN UP FORM in English](http://bit.ly/WelcomeTheReef) or\n- [SIGN UP FORM in French](http://bit.ly/BienvenueTheReef)\n\nWe will be in touch to confirm your spot, as places are limited. Meanwhile, don&rsquo;t hesitate to leave a comment below and connect with others in the Reef universe early on. If you have questions, ask!\n\n## What do we want to get out of these? The design of a community home\n\nEach workshop is open to anyone who is deeply interested in making a change in their life. They are informal meetings where we facilitate sharing of personal experiences between attendants.\nWorking languages: EN & FR.\n\n1. Participants make sense of their experiences in co-living by learning from others.\n2. Participants explore ideas for making ecology part of their homes and lifestyle\n3. Participants are presented with The Reef opportunity to collectively pursue a new kind of residential space.\n4. Practical documentation about shared aspirations that can be implemented at The Reef. This will enable those who wish to continue together to design The Reef as their future home.\n\n## The steps we are taking\n\nThe Reef is in its design phase. We have a prototype*, a concept, and a city that we love and hope will take it on board: Brussels. We invite everyone to help make it happen. \nSeveral things are already underway:\n\n* Edgeryders is pitching The Reef to the city, business partners and civil society allies who can support us to acquire a building, or invest in it.\n\n* We are looking to create an organisation to steward the process. This organisation will be based on a cooperative model and will enable those interested to acquire (parts of) property, use it, have rights to it, and a combination of them all.\n\n* We are inventorying open-source technical solutions to making buildings carbon-neutral.\n\n* We are building a group of people who are deeply interested in changing the way they live and perhaps see themselves as future inhabitants. This is The Reef Community.\n\n## Who are we and why are we doing this?\n\nEdgeryders is a community of changemakers from all around the world. Our mission is to co-create self-sustaining projects for the common good. Self-sustaining means your project creates enough (financial and non-financial) value to compensate the people working on it. The community lives in symbiosis with a social enterprise, also called Edgeryders. The company sells expert advice and research. It funds community infrastructure and supports the community&rsquo;s projects. In return, community members collaborate with the company&rsquo;s endeavors. Some members of the Edgeryders community also will be inhabitants of The Reef, and will use their experience in co-living to enrich the project.

Putting aside a certain musical-anthropoligical quality that this kind of rock/punk music fusion can have (and I personally liked it and still like it), was taken up by the major record companies around the turn of the millenium and successfully implanted into the mainstream. \n\nIn parallel politicization, in this context ethnonationlisitc appropriation, has been happening in the post-communist Europe the whole time, provided with a strong disseminative platform for this conglomerate of heterogenous symbolisms and musical reflection on folklore. Techn\u00edcally, this is the same old story of mainstreamization, but in the current context, it also unfortunately often reflects some kind of an (extreme) right turn we are experincing.\n\nWhat I was referring to was the fact that in communist Czechoslovakia, musical underground of all kinds played a paramount role in creating and maintaing a counterculture that in a way tried to be apolitical, but was forced by the regime's oppression to become a political environment. When I was a young kid going to gigs, it was still a very neutral and welcoming environment along the line of this tradition. \n\nEspecially since the refugees and migration became a dominant issue in the public discourse, seems like everyone feels they need to make a \"political\" statement and rebel against the status quo - which unfortuantely seems to be represented in the eyes of many by the humanistic values, tolerance, plurality etc. to the extent it becomes a norm... Or is this is just an optical illusion co-created by the silent majority? Nevertheless the extreme feels very much empowered and the boundaries of what is an acceptable expression of oneself have shifted..\n\nAnd thanks for a great tip for a work-soundtrack;)", "created_at": "2019-01-20 13:45:37.349613", "updated_at": "2019-01-20 15:12:09.297391", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 307, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 52.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [50186], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10911, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1132, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>What a beautiful way...</b>\n\n... to say you're coming, Bridget!\n\nI commit, too.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-07 23:09:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:02.951122", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [6990], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 56403, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 10217, "post_number": 36, "raw": "It sounds really similar to what was already built in the CS framework and then by Owen - single-site frameworks for Discourse as a CMS with client-side JavaScript.

In the end, as I told you in Addis, we could not help our Ugandan friends very much (except maybe individually); but at least we did <a href=\"/t/the-not-so-basic-plan-the-family-transition-center-as-a-testing-ground-for-appropriate-technologies/2528\">identify and discuss a promising partnership</a>. The idea was to take some project somewhere, like this family transition center, and make it double up as a \"Lo-hi technology center\". African ingenuity is a powerful force, and the international cooperation context provides a safe space for deployment of open source technology, far from IPR lobbies (yes, that can be a problem). Worst case scenario, you get a slightly more hi-tech family transition center; best case scenario, you have started the open source revolution. Mind you, I am talking about open hardware here, and with mostly a focus on agriculture: tractors, vehicles, bioreactors, or even our very own <a href=\"/t/open-source-solar-tracker/355\">solar tracker</a>. There are plenty of projects, mostly led by small groups of dedicated hackers.\n\nIf you read the thread, it will be very clear that the Life in Africa group encountered some unexpected problems and had to regroup behind \"just making it happen\", and take the project at a slower pace. Eventually, their second crowdfunding campaign <a href=\"/t/thank-you/3211\">was successful</a>, but we have not heard about a phase 2.\n\nHopefully the project is thriving in Uganda, and the offer we made then to <a href=\"/u/gracia\">@gracia</a> and <a href=\"/u/ndelo_peter\">@Ndelo_Peter</a> and the others still stands (Gracia, Peter, if you are reading us come say hello to Steadman here!).

The project focuses on explaining and contextualising the recent rise of populism in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The community research is hosted on Edgeryders, an online community of 5000 people in more than 80 countries who share experiences. By sharing experiences with one another we turn our collective knowledge into useful advice to make better decisions for ourselves and our families in the near future. As a consequence of getting to know people from around the world, we connect one another to important information, new ideas and new opportunities.\n\nThe research analysis considers content collected through http://edgeryders.eu, subject to online ethnographic analysis and semantic social network analysis.\n\nBeyond the research project, we are a community: We use the tools offered by this platform to help connect people with mutual interests, concerns and complimentary skills. The online conversation runs in parallel with events all over Europe to meet and share constructive approaches. Anyone is welcome to participate from and beyond our focus countries (Czech Republic, Poland, Serbia).\n\nThe project is funded by the European Commission under grant agreement number 822682 from 2019-2021.\n\nThis conversation is hosted by Edgeryders, in partnership with University College London, University Karlova (the Czech Republic), University Jagiellonski (Poland), University of Belgrade (Serbia).\n[/details]", "created_at": "2019-03-01 19:00:18.205673", "updated_at": "2020-09-28 09:37:39.229083", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 522, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 46.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 36276, "user_id": 3367, "topic_id": 6660, "post_number": 5, "raw": "@shajara Thanks for this proposal!

At its core are pillars of the OpenCare two year research on community alternatives to health and social care. Everywhere we look, from the hyperlocal to the international, people are committed to building solutions. **There is a nascent, ambitious, and effective ecosystem of care that is developing in response to the failures of the current models. We aim to highlight and support that development.**\n\n\nThe structure of the program brings together sessions built around three themes: Open Science, Architecture of Love, and Revolutionary Care. The themes blend and build on one another, reflective of the fundamental interdependence of care. Three fellows were selected from the variety of participants to help curate and develop the three themes as well as the festival itself.<br />\n\n**One of OpenCare\u2019s core themes has been citizen science and Open Science**. Many projects are producing highly promising products and outputs. \u201cWe have no capital, no investors, no shares\u201d \u2013 Winnie Poncelet has lined up a number of both researchers and champions of affordable and accessible technology for care who are on a learning path to improve coordination and distribute team efforts and value accordingly.<br />\n\n\n**Architectures of Love** is evoking an important thematic tension between policy and values.\nExperiences from the City of Milano, from community groups in Galway and Glasgow are a few ways to understand what are enablers for citizen-led care responses. <br />\n\n**Revolutionary Care:** Building Health Autonomy is the third theme of the festival.  As we talk about care, we are working to understand how we can live together and how we can develop our lives in commune. We ask the questions around responding to crisis, responding to our needs, and building generational models of care. Finally, as we face the destruction around us, we strive to highlight care as a fundamentally revolutionary act. The Woodbine Health Autonomy collective (represented by Nicole Demby and Frank Coughlin) based in New York City, has curated this theme. <br />\n\n\n**We know this festival will be more than another \u201cpassive\u201d conference.**  \n\nThe lines between presenter and audience are purposefully blurred and as we have worked to build the Edgeryders community, we will take the information and use it to build tangibly.  The first two days will highlight the work of different projects and groups around the world.  We look to meet new friends, share embraces with old ones, and learn together.

The week before at Cloughjordan Ecovillage I met Albert Bates, author of The Biochar Solution, (https://www.newsociety.com/Books/B/The-Biochar-Solution)which lists the products, science, and strategies regarding the use of biochar to return us to the known normal levels of atmospheric carbon by the charring of wood, turning the carbon to its recalcitrant form, and thus taking it out of the 'labile' cycle whereby organic matter rots, releasing it's carbon as atmospheric carbon which returns to the earth with rains recompiling organic matter in 12 to 15 year cycles. Biochar stays in the soil as structure, and as Willem Reich points out in the Bion Experiments, when you add potassium to char, with bacteria, you get the breakdown of said char into vesicular structures which form the basic food stuff for bacteria and microorganisms, hence biochar is both a form of capturing carbon, and a super food for soil biology. \n\nSo yes, I agree, regenerative approaches are there in evidence, and can be developed. Biochar also can serve as a sand substitute in concrete and has a number of superior properties, including that it floats, for example.  It can be used in paint, when mixed at 1% to 99% silage it reduces methane output in cattle by 35%, and improves digestion and immunity, reducing need for antibiotics,  used as bedding it suppresses ammonia formation so no ammonia smell, it can be used with plastic in recycling composites, and as a paint, among other things. Fascinating stuff. \n\nI find that inoculation,  or as Albert calls it, 'microbialisation' of the char, works well with digestate from our biodigestor. All that surface area means lots of oxygen and so the anaerobic bacteria die off leaving a foodstuff for the bacteria in the compost heap where we keep the char for a couple of weeks before putting out on the soil. We hope to go no-dig next season, with the six inch cover layer in biochar altogether. \n\nPartners to the project include DTC , the development technologies in the community research group, based in ireland at DIT, as one node of a global network.

And I don\u2019t mean vacations either \u2013 you neglect to mention fundamental improvements in people\u2019s lives since 1930 \u2013 I mean, especially, health care and education, but also research, information services (which enable us to do this project altogether), and financial services.\n[/quote]\n\nPet grooming is a service :slight_smile:\n\nAnyway, the issue here is not that Keynes failed to predict the correct configuration of society in 2019. He was not trying to do that. He was modelling one phenomenon, the substitution of labor time with leisure time. That has not happened to the extent Keynes predicted. In fact, the ILO [claims](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---cabinet/documents/publication/wcms_649907.pdf) that the reduction trend in annual work hours has stopped in the last few decades of the 20th century, and in some cases even reversed  (Sweden):\n\n> approximately one-third of the global workforce (36.1 per cent) works more than 48 hours per week. The proportion of workers working such excessively long hours is more than double in developing countries as compared with developed countries. In the former, such long hours of work are driven mainly by low wages, which means that workers often need to work long hours to make ends meet (see e.g. Lee, McCann and Messenger, 2007). The situation is a bit different in developed countries, particularly for certain categories of professional workers and managers, who may be expected to work whatever hours are required to complete their assignments and/or may work long hours to show their commitment to the organization and thus advance their careers (ibid.)\n\n![image|690x471](upload://1adwq4efzXWT93s3oUim2Riu2og.jpeg) \n\nExcept, of course: \n\n[quote=\"petussing, post:7, topic:11504\"]\nretired people have on average 16 years during which they do not work at all \u2013 that is a rather long vacation\n[/quote]\n\nThis is a great point. Again, however, the trend towards lowering retirement age has now reversed in most developed countries. I stand by the main point: as a civilization, we are investing a substantial part of our productivity gains into creating and satisfying new *material* needs (mostly of services), rather than into more leisure. Keynes did not see it coming, because he did not predict that, because he underestimated the extent to which our preferences are plastic. \n\nThis, I would argue, makes attempt to model preference plasticity potentially relevant. We even have a Sci-Fi reference: Keynes predicted the [Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series).

Introduction to Markdown</h3>\n\nMarkdown is our preferred way of formatting content. It is also used by the integrated editor when using its toolbar buttons. Let's walk through the basic options in detail:\n\n1. **Changing text to Bold**: To change text to **Bold**, use double asterisk or double Underscore symbol to enclose the words expected to be bold.  For example: `**This is bold**` will change the format to **This is Bold**.  Likewise,  `__Bold__` will change the format to __Bold__.\n\n2.  **Changing text to *Italic*:** Enclosing text in single asterisks * or underscores _ will change the word to *Italic*. For example: `*Italic*` will change the text to *Italic*. Likewise, `_Italic_` will change the text into _Italic_.\n\n3. **Headings:** For headings of the content, the  hash symbol needs to be added before the text heading. There can be multiple levels of headings in your content, depending on the number of has symbols used. Normally you would use `## Heading Level 2` for sections, and `### Heading Level 3` for sub-sections and so on.\n\n4. **Hyperlinks:** You can attach or add the desirable link to a piece of text to create a hyperlink. To attach the link you can use the \"chain icon\" toolbar button in the editor, or also the following code to create your desired link. You can customize your link by changing the name in the first bracket `[ ]`.

The \"four spaces indent\" style does not support code highlighting and suffers from messy indentations due to various bugs and quirks (see [section 4.3](#heading--4-3) for details).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--1-3\">1.3.

BBCode formatting</h2>\n\nYou can accomplish the same formats as with Markdown, and there are also some advanced features.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-1\">2.1. Common formatting</h3>\n\nThis section lists the basic text formatting options that have equivalents in Markdown. As said above, you should usually prefer Markdown.\n\n* **Bold text.**\n\n    ```plaintext\n    [b]bold[/b]\n    ```\n\n    Result: [b]bold[/b]\n\n* **Italic text.**\n\n    ```plaintext\n    [i]italic[/i]\n    ```\n\n    Result: [i]italic[/i]\n\n* **Underlined text.**\n\n    ```plaintext\n    [u]underlined[/u]\n    ```\n\n    Result: [u]underlined[/u]\n\n* **Strikethrough text.**\n\n    ```plaintext\n    [s]strikethrough[/s]\n    ```\n\n    Result: [s]strikethrough[/s]\n\n* **URLs.**\n\n    ```plaintext\n    [url]http://edgeryders.eu[/url]\n    ```\n\n    Result: [url]http://edgeryders.eu[/url]\n\n* **E-mail links.**\n\n    ```plaintext\n    [email]email@domain.com[/email]\n    ```\n\n    Result: [email]email@domain.com[/email]\n\n* **Quote section.** When copy&pasting a text from an e-mail or document, using this markup around it is much faster than adding `> \u2026`  to each line. That's a valid reason not to use Markdown for this case.\n\n    ```plaintext\n    [quote]\n    Something quoted from somewhere.\n    [/quote]\n    ```\n\n    Result:\n\n    [quote]Something quoted from somewhere.[/quote]\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--2-2\">2.2. Additional features</h3>\n\n* **Extended quote section (Discourse specific).** This kind of code is automatically generated when selecting text in Discourse and clicking the <kbd>Quote</kbd> button that appears.\n\n    ```plaintext\n    [quote=\"community_wiki, post:1, topic:2\"]\n    Something this user said, with a link to it.\n    [/quote]\n    ```\n\n    Result:\n\n    [quote=\"community_wiki, post:1, topic:2\"]Something this user said, with a link to it.[/quote]\n\n* **Code section.**\n\n    ```plaintext\n    [code]\n    <?php \n    echo 'Hello world'; \n    ?>\n    [/code]\n    ```\n\n    Result:\n\n    [code]\n  <?php \n  echo 'Hello world'; \n  ?>\n    [/code]\n\n* **Hidden details.** For more information about this element, see \"[Hiding details and editorial comments](/t/9573)\".\n\n    ```plaintext\n    [details=hiding details / \"spoiler alert\"]it's a sled[/details]\n    ```\n\n    Result:\n\n    [details=hiding details / \"spoiler alert\"]it's a sled[/details]\n\n* **Right-to-left text.** We added this to Discourse using a plugin. For more details about the right-to-left text tag, please refer to [Writing in Arabic and other right-to-left scripts (RTL)](/t/id/6511). The function is currently broken, as you can see in the non-working example below.\n\n    ```plaintext\n    [text-direction=rtl]\n    \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\n    [/text-direction]\n    ```\n\n    Result:\n\n    [text-direction=rtl]\n    \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\n    [/text-direction]\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--3\">3. HTML formatting</h2>\n\n**Use Markdown by default.** You can freely mix HTML formatting and Markdown / BBCode formatting in Discourse, so HTML tags are yet another way to create formatting for those features that Markdown / BBCode offers. However, Markdown has several advantage, so where both Markdown and HTML offer a desired feature, by convention we use Markdown:\n\n* Markdown leads to more readable source.\n* Markdown is also created by the buttons of the Discourse editor and thus the markup language that most users will default to anyway.\n* HTML source formatting has to make do without empty lines for vertical spacing due to the way switching between HTML and Markdown works in Discourse (see below). As a result, the HTML source is visually hard to navigate and read.\n\nHTML equivalents of Markdown formatting can be used in special cases however, for example for automatically imported content.\n\n**Switching between HTML and inline Markdown.** Character-level Markdown formatting works in most HTML tags without issues. Example:\n\n```xml\n<small>**Small but bold!**</small>\n```\n\nResult: <small>**Small but bold!**</small>\n\n**Switching between HTML and block-level Markdown.** For this, you have to finish the HTML mode by creating an empty line. This is possible also without closing all HTML tags, allowing to place a Markdown formatted paragraph or table or image and then to continue with HTML, closing the open tages. Example:\n\n```xml\n<details open><summary>\n\n*Want to know an open secret?*\n\n</summary>\n\n> Open secrets don't exist. Everything is either open or a secret.\n\n</details>\n```\n\nResult:\n\n<details open><summary>\n\n*Want to know an open secret?*\n\n</summary>\n\n> Open secrets don't exist. Everything is either open or a secret.\n\n</details>\n\nAs can be seen from `<summary>\u2026</summary>` in the example above, this mechanism is still a bit buggy as it can create extra line breaks. In addition, you can not use the HTML source indentation level for your Markdown paragraphs, as \"four spaces\" at the start of the line mean code block formatting in Markdown. Instead, start Markdown formatted paragraphs without leading whitespace. Obviously, this makes the mixed HTML / Markdown source code hard to read and rarely a good idea in practice.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-1\">3.1. Common formatting</h3>\n\nThis section lists the basic text formatting options that have equivalents in Markdown. As said above, you should usually prefer Markdown.\n\n* bold: `<b>\u2026</b>`, `<strong>\u2026</strong>`\n* italics: `<i>\u2026</i>`, `<em>\u2026</em>`\n* strikethrough: `<s>\u2026</s>` and `<strike>\u2026</strike>`\n* inline code: `<code>\u2026</code>`\n* headings: `<h1>\u2026</h1>`, `<h2>\u2026</h2>` to `<h6>\u2026</h6>`\n* horizontal rule: `<hr/>`\n* line break: `<br/>`\n* paragraph: `<p>\u2026</p>`\n* quote: `<blockquote>\u2026</blockquote>`\n* code blocks: `<pre><code>\u2026</code></pre>`\n* bullet list: `<ul> <li>\u2026</li> </ul>`\n* numbered list: `<ol> <li>\u2026</li> </ol>`\n* table: `<table><tr><td>\u2026</td></tr></table>` (for details, see [Adding tables](/t/-/6463#heading--3-3))\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-2\">3.2. Additional features</h3>\n\nThe more useful part of HTML in Discourse are the following additional capabilities compared to Markdown formatting:\n\n* **Smallprint.** For example for image credits.\n\n    ```xml\n    <small>small text</small>\n    ```\n\n    Result: <small>small text</small>\n\n* **Superscript.**\n\n    ```xml\n    <sup>superscript</sup>\n    ```\n\n    Result: <sup>superscript</sup>\n\n* **Subscript.**\n\n    ```xml\n    <sub>subscript</sub>\n    ```\n\n    Result: <sub>subscript</sub>\n\n* **Abbreviations.** This tag allows to define abbreviations, and the long form will be shown when hovering over the text.\n\n    ```xml\n    The <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> has a horrible copyright law.\n    ```\n\n    Result: The <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> has a horrible copyright law.\n\n* **Buttons.** This HTML element can be used to symbolize individual keyboard keys and also user interface buttons. Very useful when writing help texts.\n\n    ```xml\n    <kbd>k</kbd> <kbd>+ New Topic</kbd> <kbd>**Fat Button**</kbd>\n    ```\n\n    Result: <kbd>k</kbd> <kbd>+ New Topic</kbd> <kbd>**Fat Button**</kbd>\n\n* **Hidden details.** This is equivalent to the BBCode `[details=\"\u2026\"]\u2026[/details]` tag supported in Discourse, but provides additional options: formatting of the summary text, opportunity to use it inside HTML tables, and the opportunity to use proper source code formatting.

Paragraph with hidden details (using HTML)](/t/9573#heading--2)\".\n\n    ```xml\n    <details>\n        <summary>Summary Text</summary>\n        Hidden Details Text\n    </details>\n    ```\n\n    Result: \n\n    <details>\n        <summary>Summary Text</summary>\n        Hidden Details Text\n    </details>\n\n* **Insertions and deletions.** Use this to explicitly show changes you made or propose to a text. It has nothing to do with a post's edit history feature.\n\n    ```xml\n    \"Hello <del>world</del> <ins>universe</ins>.\"\n    ```\n\n    Result: \"Hello <del>world</del> <ins>universe</ins>.\"\n\n* **Numbered lists with custom start numbering.** You can set the starting number of a numbered list, for example to continue somebody else's list in another post, or to break up your own list into multiple parts, with other content in between.\n\n    ```xml\n    <ol start=\"7\">\n        <li>One item.</li>\n        <li>Another item.</li>\n    </ol>\n    ```\n\n    Result:\n\n    <ol start=\"7\">\n        <li>One item.</li>\n        <li>Another item.</li>\n    </ol>\n\n* **Definition lists.** To define terms, you can list them in a list like this:\n\n    ```xml\n    <dl>\n        <dt>Coffee</dt>\n        <dd>A black liquid.</dd>\n        <dt>Milk</dt>\n        <dd>A white liquid.</dd>\n    </dl>\n    ```\n\n    Result:\n\n    <dl>\n        <dt>Coffee</dt>\n        <dd>A black liquid.</dd>\n        <dt>Milk</dt>\n        <dd>A white liquid.</dd>\n    </dl>\n\n* **Aside content.** This is meant to logically mark content that is only tangentially related to the main text content, such as content that would be placed in callout boxes or sidebars. At present, it visually appears the same as normal content, but that can be easily adapted with CSS in the Discourse theme.\n\n    ```xml\n    <aside>\n        Hello world.\n    </aside>\n    ```\n\n    Result:\n    <aside>\n        Hello world.\n    </aside>\n\n* **Link anchors.** For explanations, see our help sections \"[Adding link targets](/t/-/6463#heading--4-4)\" and \"[Adding a table of contents](/t/-/7543#heading--2)\".\n\n    ```xml\n    <h1 id=\"heading--\u2026\">\u2026</h1>\n    \u22ee\n    <h6 id=\"heading--\u2026\">\u2026</h6>\n\n    <a name=\"\u2026\"></a>\n    ```\n\n* **Non-breaking space.** Useful to create horizontal space at the beginning of a paragraph similar to a hanging indent, and vertical space when placed on its own line.\n\n    ```xml\n    Normal line.\n    &nbsp; Line with a hanging indent.\n    ```\n\n    Result:\n    Normal line.\n    &nbsp; Line with a hanging indent.\n\n* **HTML entities.** Useful as memorizeable special characters. There is a [long list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references#Character_entity_references_in_HTML).\n\n* **Indentation for anything.** Lists provide indentation in multiple levels, but outside of lists Markdown provides no way to indent any content (including standard text paragraphs over quotes, code, hidden details sections, images and tables). This is esp. annoying for images, which are always left-aligned due to this.\n\n    As a hack, `<ul> \u2026 </ul>` and `<ol> \u2026 </ol>` _without_ their `<li>` elements can be used to indent any such content. By nesting these elements, indentation can be done on multiple levels.\n\n    This hack can also be used _inside_ Markdown lists, but in the code you have to use leading whitespace on the lines with the opening and closing tags properly (see [section 4.3.](#heading--4-3) for details) in order to create the indentation relative to the current list item and not relative to the left border of the document. Because the latter case would imply finishing the Markdown list. If that's a numbered Markdown list, the numbering is reset and would start again from \"1\", which is not what you want.\n\n    ```\n    <ul>\n\n      ![test image|88x31](upload://q7MC9yJNpYqjfS68RId87oHKzUE.png)\n\n    </ul>\n    ```\n\n    Result:\n\n    <ul>\n\n    ![test image|88x31](upload://q7MC9yJNpYqjfS68RId87oHKzUE.png)\n\n    </ul>\n\n* **Code blocks without background formatting.** As a side effect of using `<pre>\u2026</pre>` without an additional `<code>\u2026</code>` tag inside, you can create preformatted text in fixed-width font but without the usual gray background of code blocks:\n\n    ```\n    <pre>Hello \n    world!</pre>\n    ```\n\n    Result:\n\n    <pre>Hello \n  world!</pre>\n\n* **Code blocks with manual text formatting.** Markdown can do automatic code highlighting, but you cannot manually change the formatting of characters inside a code block, for example to highlight a section in bold. With HTML, you can:\n\n    ```\n    <pre><code>Hello <b>world</b>!</code></pre>\n    ```\n\n    Result:\n\n    <pre><code>Hello <b>world</b>!</code></pre>\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--3-3\">3.3. Unsupported features</h3>\n\nNot all HTML features can be used, as some tags and attributes will be removed by Discourse when generating the output HTML (they will still be available in the editor, though). This includes:\n\n* all attributes, with a few exceptions like `<a name=\"\u2026\">`, `<h\u2026 id=\"heading--\u2026\">`.\n\n* HTML imagemap elements `<map><area> \u2026 </area></map>`\n\n* HTML element `<progress>` to render a progress bar; though [this can be added with a plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/29177)\n\n* all other HTML elements not listed as working, though many could be added with simple custom Discourse plugins\n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--4\">4. Details about lists</h2>\n\nThe following sections explain the rather intimidating details of list formatting in Discourse: how multiple list levels, paragraphs and text types combine.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-1\">4.1. Using Markdown: multi-level lists</h3>\n\nYou can use numbered and unnumbered lists, and mix them together on multiple levels.\n\nAs a result, the following code:\n\n```markdown\n1. List 1, Item 1\n\n    * List 2, Item 1\n    * List 2, Item 2\n\n        * List 3, Item 1\n\n2. List 1, Item 2\n```\n\nwill create this output:\n\n1. List 1, Item 1\n\n    * List 2, Item 1\n    * List 2, Item 2\n\n        * List 3, Item 1\n\n2. List 1, Item 2\n\nTo avoid seeing confusing behavior if you change these lists later to include multiple paragraphs per list item (see below), you should already adhere to the following formatting standards, already shown in the example above:\n\n1. **Four spaces per level.** Use four spaces per list level for indentation. Technically, three or more spaces will work per list level as long as you keep it the same for all items of one list level, but four spaces are required to place a second paragraph below a parent list item (see below). So using four spaces to mean \"one hierarchy level\" everywhere makes the code most easy to understand.\n\n2. **Empty line between list levels.** Separate list items of _different_ list levels with an empty line, while list items on the same list levels can be separated by either an empty line or just a line break. (An empty line will create a larger gap in this case.) Without this, the \"four spaces per level\" method to create multiple paragraphs per list item will not work properly (see below).\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-2\">4.2. Using Markdown: multiple paragraphs per item</h3>\n\nThis is a confusing case. It happens when you want to have multiple paragraphs in a single list item. These paragraphs [can be of different types](#heading--4-3) like quotation or code, but in this section we show the basic principle only, with pure text paragraphs.\n\nThere are two alternatives to make this happen:\n\n**The first alternative** is \"one linebreak\".\n\n```markdown\n1. List 1, Item 1, paragraph 1\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 2\n    1. List 2, Item 1, paragraph 1\n        List 2, Item 1, paragraph 2\n        List 2, Item 1, paragraph 3\n```\n\nIt produces just linebreaks when used with ordinary text (no gap between paragraphs), but paragraphs when used mixed with quotations.\n\n1. List 1, Item 1, paragraph 1\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 2\n    1. List 2, Item 1, paragraph 1\n        List 2, Item 1, paragraph 2\n        List 2, Item 1, paragraph 3\n\n**The second alternative** is \"one empty line and four spaces per list level\".\n\n```markdown\n1. List 1, Item 1, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 2\n\n    1. List 2, Item 1, paragraph 1\n\n        List 2, Item 1, paragraph 2\n\n        List 2, Item 1, paragraph 3\n```\n\nIt produces real paragraphs in all cases:\n\n1. List 1, Item 1, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 2\n\n    1. List 2, Item 1, paragraph 1\n\n        List 2, Item 1, paragraph 2\n\n        List 2, Item 1, paragraph 3\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-3\">4.3. Using Markdown: different text types per item</h3>\n\nThis builds on the basic technique of having [multiple paragraphs of text in one list item](#heading--4-2), but now allows the paragraphs to be of different types: normal text, quotes, code or tables. It works with both alternatives to create multiple paragraphs in a list item (\"one linebreak\" and \"one empty line and four spaces per list level\").\n\nYou can selectively replace any text paragraph of a list item, including the first, with:\n\n* **a quote section**, either in the Markdown or BBCcode notation\n\n    If a BBCode quote section contains multiple paragraphs of text, the \"one empty line and four spaces per list level\" rule must be applied to each paragraph. See the example below.\n\n    An exception here is that when using the \"one line break\" technique and inserting a quote paragraph with `>\u2026` Markdown formatting, there is no way to switch back to normal text inside that list item. Because this quote is valid up to an empty line. In this case, you have to continue with the \"one empty line and four spaces per list level\" technique to create the next non-quote paragraph.\n\n* **a code section**, either in the Markdown or BBCcode notation\n\n    When using Markdown, it is recommended to use the ` ```\u2026``` ` \"codefences\" code syntax because it leads to uniform indentations: you can choose how many spaces to use per list level as long as you use the same number on each line and it's at least two. By convention, we use four spaces per list level. Also, the codefences code syntax provides syntax highlighting.\n\n    On the other hand, the \"four spaces\" Markdown code syntax does not provide syntax highlighting, requires a different indentation for the same list level, and is affected by a quirk or Discourse bug that means you can not choose the number of spaces per list indentation level. Instead, the required number of spaces is hardcoded as \"six more than required for the parent list item\", which means four spaces for the code styling and two for the list level, breaking our convention to use four for that.\n\n* **a hidden details section**\n\n    If the hidden details section contains multiple paragraphs of text, the \"one empty line and four spaces per list level\" rule must be applied to each paragraph. See the example below.\n\n* **a table**, using HTML notation or [Markdown table notation](/t/6463#heading--2-17)\n\n    As an exception, this works only with the \"one empty line and four spaces per list level\" technique to create multiple paragraphs per list item.\n\n    When using HTML notation, the list level is determined by the leading whitespace in the line starting with `<table>`. Whitespace in all other lines is just code cosmetics, _except_ that you also need the right amount of leading whitespace in the line with `</table>` or list items after the table would appear on the wrong list level (this seems to be a Discourse bug). You can also paste all of the HTML code in one line, which makes it more compact and you only have to adjust leading whitespace on that one line.\n\n* **a HTML block element**\n\n    For example, a HTML table as described just above. It works for any other block-level HTML element too, though, including HTML lists. The same rules for indentation apply: use four spaces per list level in the lines with the opening and closing tags.\n\n\nExample with all of the above:\n\n```xml\n*   [quote]\n    Item 1, paragraph 1\n\n    Item 1, paragraph 2\n    [/quote]\n\n    Item 1, paragraph 3\n\n    Item 1, paragraph 4\n\n    [details=List 1, Item 1, paragraph 5 (and 6-7 inside)]\n    Item 1, paragraph 6\n\n    Item 1, paragraph 7\n    [/details]\n\n    ```\n    Item 1, paragraph 8\n    ```\n\n    | Col A | Col B | Col C   |\n    |-------|-------|---------|\n    | A1    | B1    | C1      |\n    | A2    | B2    | :smile: |\n\n    <table>\n      <tr>\n        <th>Col A</th>\n        <th>Col B</th>\n        <th>Col C</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>A1</td>\n        <td>B1</td>\n        <td>C1</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>A2</td>\n        <td>B2</td>\n        <td>:smile:</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n\n* Item 2, paragraph 1\n```\n\nResult:\n\n*   [quote]\n    Item 1, paragraph 1\n\n    Item 1, paragraph 2\n    [/quote]\n\n    Item 1, paragraph 3\n\n    Item 1, paragraph 4\n\n    [details=List 1, Item 1, paragraph 5 (and 6-7 inside)]\n    Item 1, paragraph 6\n\n    Item 1, paragraph 7\n    [/details]\n\n    ```\n    Item 1, paragraph 8\n    ```\n\n    | Col A | Col B | Col C   |\n    |-------|-------|---------|\n    | A1    | B1    | C1      |\n    | A2    | B2    | :smile: |\n\n    <table>\n      <tr>\n        <th>Col A</th>\n        <th>Col B</th>\n        <th>Col C</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>A1</td>\n        <td>B1</td>\n        <td>C1</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>A2</td>\n        <td>B2</td>\n        <td>:smile:</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n\n* Item 2, paragraph 1\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-4\">4.4. Using Markdown: multiple lists per item</h3>\n\nThis is the most weird case: it is possible to nest multiple independent lists inside one multi-paragraph list item. It requires you to use the \"one empty line and four spaces per list level\" technique to create multiple parapgraphs in one list item. Then, you can exchange the second, third etc. paragraph of a list item with a nested list item \u2013 so far just the normal way to create multi-level lists. But now, you can _switch back_ to a plain-text paragraph on the _previous_ list level, and if you choose, you can again switch to a list item, starting another independent nested list.\n\nExample:\n\n```markdown\n1. List 1, Item 1, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 2\n\n    1. List 2, Item 1, paragraph 1\n    2. List 2, Item 2, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 3\n\n    1. List 3, Item 1, paragraph 1\n    2. List 3, Item 2, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 4\n\n2. List 1, Item 2, paragraph 1\n```\n\nResult:\n\n1. List 1, Item 1, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 2\n\n    1. List 2, Item 1, paragraph 1\n    2. List 2, Item 2, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 3\n\n    1. List 3, Item 1, paragraph 1\n    2. List 3, Item 2, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 4\n\n2. List 1, Item 2, paragraph 1\n\nThe same works with unordered lists.\n\nExample:\n\n```markdown\n* List 1, Item 1, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 2\n\n    * List 2, Item 1, paragraph 1\n    * List 2, Item 2, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 3\n\n    * List 3, Item 1, paragraph 1\n    * List 3, Item 2, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 4\n\n* List 1, Item 2, paragraph 1\n```\n\nResult:\n\n* List 1, Item 1, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 2\n\n    * List 2, Item 1, paragraph 1\n    * List 2, Item 2, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 3\n\n    * List 3, Item 1, paragraph 1\n    * List 3, Item 2, paragraph 1\n\n    List 1, Item 1, paragraph 4\n\n* List 1, Item 2, paragraph 1\n\nAnd you can of course also mix ordered and unordered lists, multiple paragraphs in the nested lists, of different text types, and so on in many levels. Madness! :laughing: \n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-5\">4.5. Using BBCode</h3>\n\nLists are no longer possible with BBCode in recent versions of Discourse.\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-6\">4.6. Using HTML</h3>\n\nLists, including multi-level nested lists and lists with multiple paragraphs per element, can be created using standard HTML elements. The following code:\n\n```xml\n<ol>\n    <li>List 1, Item 1\n        <ul>\n            <li>List 2, Item 1</li>\n            <li>List 2, Item 2</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>List 1, Item 2</li>\n</ol>\n```\n\nproduces this output:\n\n<ol>\n    <li>List 1, Item 1\n        <ul>\n            <li>List 2, Item 1</li>\n            <li>List 2, Item 2</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>List 1, Item 2</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### <h3 id=\"heading--4-7\">4.7. Foldable lists</h3>\n\n#### With bullets\n\nAn interesting way to structure really complex lists is to allow folding and unfolding every list item, in multiple levels. This is just an application of the basic technique described above. We use `&nbsp;\u25b7&nbsp;` to mark non-foldable list items in such a way that they (almost) properly align with foldable list items.\n\nExample:\n\n```plaintext\n*   [details=\"List 1, Item 1\"]\n    *   [details=\"List 2, Item 1\"]\n        * List 3, Item 1\n        * List 3, Item 2\n        [/details]\n    * &nbsp;\u25b7&nbsp; List 2, Item 2\n    [/details]\n\n*   [details=\"List 1, Item 2\"]\n    *   [details=\"List 4, Item 1\"]\n        * List 5, Item 1\n        * List 5, Item 2\n        [/details]\n    * &nbsp;\u25b7&nbsp; List 4, Item 2\n    [/details]\n```\n\nResult:\n\n*   [details=\"List 1, Item 1\"]\n    *   [details=\"List 2, Item 1\"]\n        * List 3, Item 1\n        * List 3, Item 2\n        [/details]\n    * &nbsp;\u25b7&nbsp; List 2, Item 2\n    [/details]\n\n*   [details=\"List 1, Item 2\"]\n    *   [details=\"List 4, Item 1\"]\n        * List 5, Item 1\n        * List 5, Item 2\n        [/details]\n    * &nbsp;\u25b7&nbsp; List 4, Item 2\n    [/details]\n\n\n#### Without bullets (CSS solution)\n\nThe typical list bullets of unordered lists are redundant, as the fold / unfold triangle can visually function as a bullet as well.\n\nThe cleanest / best way to achieve that is to adapt the Discourse theme CSS so that a `details` element inside another `details` element will be shown with an indentation. Also, text should start aligned with normal text paragraphs. Obviously, you can enable this solution only when you're admin of a Discourse platform.\n\n```css\n.cooked > ul > details {\n    margin-left: 2.7em;\n    \n    details {\n        margin-left: 2.7em;\n    }\n    summary {\n        margin-left: -4em;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen, foldable lists can be simply written like this, nicely using one indentation level per list level:\n\n```xml\n<ul>\n<details><summary>List 1, Item 1</summary>\n    <details><summary>List 2, Item 1</summary>\n        <div>List 3, Item 1</div>\n        <div>List 3, Item 1</div>\n    </details>\n    <div>List 2, Item 2</div>\n    <div>List 2, Item 3</div>\n</details>\n<div>List 1, Item 2</div>\n</ul>\n```\n\nResult:\n\n<ul>\n<details><summary>List 1, Item 1</summary>\n    <details><summary>List 2, Item 1</summary>\n            <div>List 3, Item 1</div>\n            <div>List 3, Item 1</div>\n    </details>\n    <div>List 2, Item 2</div>\n    <div>List 2, Item 3</div>\n</details>\n<div>List 1, Item 2</div>\n</ul>\n\nCaveats:\n\n* To align properly with normal paragraphs of text, the `summary` element needs to be moved left. So first we have to move all paragraphs of the list right, which is done easiest with a `<ul>\u2026</ul>` tag in Discourse (as that is already provided and we don't have a class attribute or similar to make something like that with CSS).\n\n* At the same time, the proposed (and here applied) CSS uses the single outer `<ul>` element _at the first tag level in a post_ to detect when the nested formatting is expected, to not interfere with any other / normal usage of the details element. So, it won't work without that outer `<ul>`, and it won't work inside other lists and tables, only at the root level of a post.\n\n\n#### Without bullets (ul indentation hack)\n\nHere is a technique for foldable lists without bullets that works in any Discourse installation, without need for changes to the theme.\n\nExample:\n\n```xml\n<details><summary>List 1, Item 1</summary>\n    <ul>\n    <details><summary>List 2, Item 1</summary>\n        <ul>\n        <li>List 3, Item 1</li>\n        <li>List 3, Item 2</li>\n        </ul>\n    </details>\n    &nbsp;\u25b7&nbsp; List 2, Item 2\n    </ul>\n</details>\n&nbsp;\u25b7&nbsp; List 1, Item 2\n```\n\nResult:\n\n<details><summary>List 1, Item 1</summary>\n    <ul>\n    <details><summary>List 2, Item 1</summary>\n        <ul>\n        <li>List 3, Item 1</li>\n        <li>List 3, Item 2</li>\n        </ul>\n    </details>\n    &nbsp;\u25b7&nbsp; List 2, Item 2\n    </ul>\n</details>\n&nbsp;\u25b7&nbsp; List 1, Item 2\n\nCaveats:\n\n* Indentation is achieved with the `<ul>\u2026</ul>` HTML element, without the elements for list items. Since this is a hack, you cannot assume that this will work with all future versions of Discourse.\n\n* The equivalent is also possible with the `[details=\"\u2026\"]\u2026[/details]` BBCode tag. However, since four spaces of indentation outside of a Markdown list or HTML source context means \"Markdown code block formatting\" to Discourse, you cannot indent such a foldable list according to the list level. This makes it hard to edit, which is why we prefer the HTML version from above.\n\n* If you can change your Discourse theme, the cleanest solution is to use the technique \"with bullets\" and then to hide the bullets with CSS. You can let your CSS rule detect an `<a name=\"\u2026\">\u2026</a>` tag around your foldable list, as that is one of the few tags where user-defined attributes are not filtered out by Discourse.\n\n\n#### Without bullets (definition list technique)\n\nHere is another technique for foldable lists without bullets that works in any Discourse installation, without need for changes to the theme.\n\nExample:\n\n```xml\n<dl>\n    <dt><details>\n        <summary>List 1, Item 1</summary>\n        <dd>\n            <dl>\n                <dt><details>\n                    <summary>List 1, Item 1</summary>\n                    <dd>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>List 3, Item 1</li>\n                            <li>List 3, Item 2</li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </dd>\n                </details></dt>\n                <dt>&nbsp;\u25b7&nbsp; List 1, Item 2</dt>\n            </dl>\n        </dd>\n    </details></dt>\n    <dt>&nbsp;\u25b7&nbsp; List 1, Item 2</dt>\n</dl>\n```\n\nResult:\n\n<dl>\n    <dt><details>\n        <summary>List 1, Item 1</summary>\n        <dd>\n            <dl>\n                <dt><details>\n                    <summary>List 1, Item 1</summary>\n                    <dd>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>List 3, Item 1</li>\n                            <li>List 3, Item 2</li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </dd>\n                </details></dt>\n                <dt>&nbsp;\u25b7&nbsp; List 1, Item 2</dt>\n            </dl>\n        </dd>\n    </details></dt>\n    <dt>&nbsp;\u25b7&nbsp; List 1, Item 2</dt>\n</dl>\n\nCaveats:\n\n* It's a messy, hard to edit HTML source.\n* The tag structure is not standard compliant for a `<dl>` element, as we (have to) do it like this:\n    ```xml\n    <dl>\n        <dt>\u2026\n            <dd>\u2026</dd>\n        </dt>\n    </dl>\n    ```\n    It seems to work, though :smiley: \n\n\n## <h2 id=\"heading--5\">5. Using emojis</h2>\n\nYou can select desired emojis with the emoji icon in the Discourse text editor.\n\nFor fast and easy formatting, you can type the emoji's name, with a colon `:` at the start and end. \n This also allows a shorthand trick: you can just type colon `:` and the first letter(s) of the emoji name. The list of relevant emojis will then appear on the screen for selection.\n\nFor example: to place  the :smile: emoji you can type `:smile:` or, for the shorthand trick, just type  `:s` and select it.\n\nFor a one-page overview reference of all the available emojis, refer to the <a href=\"https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/\" target=\"_blank\">Emoji Cheat Sheet </a>.", "created_at": "2017-08-21 07:48:27.198040", "updated_at": "2019-06-01 06:11:35.218863", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 5631, "wiki": true, "reads": 26, "score": 3737.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [2], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 6107], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16260, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1413, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>An outsider's first impression</b>\n\nIt is great that you are posting from an occupied theater, Elisabetta! If this is not riding the Edge, I don't know what is :-)\n\nWe met in Teatro Valle. And here is my impression of why there might be a disconnect: at least in the case of the Valle people, as much as I like them, there is a very clear emphasis on the concepts of \"Primacy of culture\", \"artists and other culture as workers\" and \"workers rights\". Taken together, those concepts seem to imply a claim that the rest of us should stand up for the rights of culture workers to get on with their life - which, in the current Italian context, means to leave well alone public spending on culture, because the public sector is the main buyer for theater productions (unless you are Compagnia dell'Arancia and you are doing Mamma mia! The musical at Teatro Nazionale in Milan).\n\nNow, there is no problem with such a claim. It is legitimate and reasonable. But most people - including those that participate in social movements - don't go to the theater, and they have other problems on their hands. We are asked to show our solidarity with trade unions, FIAT workers, teachers, even (as you remember from that meeting in Valle) journalists working for official organs of political parties. Everybody is competing for our attention, and actors are pretty low in the pecking order (I don't say this out of disdain: I used to be a professional artist myself). Also, it is not clear whether this solidarizing will actually come back to benefit me as a free agent with no affiliation (as the vast majority of Edgeryders. I am told I should stand with the trade unions to protect the ban on unjustified firing. Fine. But will the trade unions stand for me when my pension contribution as a freelancer (=\u00a0 someboby who is unlikely ever to get a pension) is moved to 33%? Unlikely.\n\nSo, I think the Valle people are dead right when they try to leverage the availability of a space, the theater itself, as a capital asset to generate revenues that can engender a sustainable culture business. With all my heart I hope they succeed. Because solidarity is a pretty devalued currency these days, especially if you are not doing something absolutely essential like being a doctor or a teacher.

We are going to be working with the United Nations Development Programme, scanning the horizon in three countries (Armenia, Egypt and Georgia) in the hope to detect trends that will shape our common future as they start to unfold. We are very excited: this is exactly the kind of cutting-edge work we aspire to do, and Giulio Quaggiotto and his posse at UNDP-CIS are exactly the kind of people we aspire to work with.\n\nThis deal marks a watershed in the Edgeryders trajectory. We were a joint project of the Council of Europe and the European Commission from launch in late 2011 to sunset at the end of 2012. In January 2013 some of us, enamoured with what we had come to see as a uniquely valuable community, stepped in and spun it off onto a newly built online platform. In May 2013 we founded a non-profit social enterprise, Edgeryders LBG, to provide the infrastructure and the sense of direction we felt were needed to keep the community together.\n\nWe would do this by providing work opportunities to our community on the edge (many of us are close to uncontractable for various reasons: too young and unexperienced, too old, too minority, too anti-authoritarian, too propense to being self-taught rather than academic achievers...). <strong>And not just any work opportunities: <em>meaningful</em> ones, cutting-edge, high-risk, potentially world-changing, one-step-removed-from crazy work opportunities.</strong> We would be the skunkworks of the global society, the Foreign Legion of social innovation, the people that have little to lose, and so can afford to go to the ugliest places and take on the scariest work.\n\nWe would do this in part directly, by going out and pitching our community as a \"distributed think tank\" that swarms near-instantly around any interesting problem you throw at it; but the most innovative part of the model was that we would also help members of the community to provide those opportunities for themselves and each other. To secure this, we built our company so that it can serve as a vehicle for anyone in the community to use. <strong>This way, people would be able to quickly prototype their ideas without worrying about having to start a company: if they needed an incorporation they could simply use us as a \"corporate shell\", an interface towards a world that understands corporations but not communities. </strong>Basically, anyone who wishes to do so (with minimal limitations) can put on an Edgeryders hat and talk to potential clients or funders as if representing the company \u2013 this makes us the first (to my knowledge) <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/2013/11/25/introducing-edgeryders-the-corporation-without-permission/\">corporation without permission</a>. On launching a successful project, we simply hire them to run them: this is a process we describe as <a href=\"/t/making-lote3/360/hire-yourself-using-edgeryders-as-a-corporate-shell-for-your-projects\">hiring yourself</a>. Of course, we also informally try and help people with ideas and the will to work hard, mostly by connecting with others in the community with relevant skills and experience.\n\nWe gave ourselves a year to find out whether this plan had a chance of working. We were not too worried \u2013 we had learnt our lesson from the tech industry so many of us gravitate around, and had made it really cheap to fail. Three months to go to that deadline. Here's where we are:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>On the corporate front, <strong>we have secured the UNDP contract</strong>. Two more contracts are in the pipeline, and we expect them to come through well before May.</li>\n\n<li><strong>We have secured a deal with the Italian city of Matera</strong> to provide a (spectacular!) building and some seed funding for the world's first <a href=\"http://unmonastery.eu\">unMonastery</a>, a project of some visionary edgeryders led by @ben. After much preparation, unMonastery Matera went live on February 1st.</li>\n\n<li><strong>We have served as a corporate shell for several community projects</strong>. Two of them succeeded in raising seed funding: these are Matthias Ansorg's <a href=\"http://economyapp.eu/\">Economy App</a>, winner of the first European Social Innovation Competition in 2013, and David Bovill's <a href=\"/t/the-viral-academy/358\">Viral Academy</a>, recipient of a Nominet Trust grant on digital innovation in 2014. I am confident that many more will come through, for reasons explained below. Another project just launched is @saidhamideh's EdgeLance, a communication agency that leverages the unusual brand of creativity of many edgeryders to build cutting-edge communication services. Said, a professional freelance communicator, has chosen wrap EdgeLance into the Edgeryders LBG corporate shell.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Meanwhile, the community has thrived despite the end of the Council of Europe's tenure</strong>. We have been able to organize, with no funding at all, the third <a href=\"/t/lote3/312\">Living On The Edge</a> event, that gathered over 100 edgeryders from all over the continent in the (then unfinished) unMonastery premises. Over the past year, the community has gathered 700 new members and produced about 1,000 posts, wikis and tasks and well over 3,000 comments.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nMy conclusion: <strong>our proof of concept is done</strong>. Edgeryders can indeed be a viable business. But we are well aware that proving a concept is not the same thing as making it work in practice. We may be fast and smart, but incumbent consulting are <em>big</em>, and scary. Can we really carve a niche for ourselves, expand it and keep the McKinseys, Accentures and Gartners of the world away from it?\n\nTime will tell. <strong>But we do have one thing we have going for us: we are not a predator, we are a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(biology)\">mutualistic</a> symbiont </strong>to our community<strong>. </strong>We don't just recruit the smartest people from the community; we hate digital sharecropping, and try very hard never to be the slightest bit exploitative. We invest in the community and serve it as best we can; we believe we can only be a viable business <em>because</em> we serve it. <strong>Investments in this community pay back tenfolds, because it is so smart and fast as to be almost frightening</strong>. New conventions and tools continue to be proposed: some are adopted and spread, like the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/summary-of-unmonastery-community-call-4\">community call</a>, the \"call a human\" button, the <a href=\"/t/a-tale-of-three-communities-a-network-analysis-of-the-twitterstorm/481\">Twitterstorm</a>, the <a href=\"/casetracker\">Task Manager</a>.\n\nAmong the potentially most significant are the <a href=\"/t/formstorm/348\">FormStorm</a> and its <a href=\"/t/formstorm/348/projects-recycle-bin-ready-to-remix-resubmit\">Recycling Bin</a>, dreamed up by Ksenia Serova and her crew: the idea is to socialize application writing, helping each other take part in contests and competitions. This was tested <em>very</em> successfully with the European Social Innovation Competition: the community got together (virtually) and produced 13 applications (about 1% of the total applications submitted throughout Europe). Two of them, Giacomo Neri's <a href=\"/t/formstorm/348/my-proposal-for-diogochallenge\">Moove</a> and Epelia's <a href=\"/t/food-supply-unchained/553\">Food Supply Unchained</a>, were shortlisted for the semi-finals (@lois is prototyping the latter in unMonastery Matera, another sign that a whole ecosystem is emerging from what we do). More, much more is cooking.\n\n<strong>While many edgeryders are individually very smart, we believe this kind of performance to be an emergent property of the whole community, with its tools and its values</strong>. It is, truly, collective intelligence.  And if this is what happens with fewer than two thousands registered users, we can only imagine how fast this crowd can move as that number scales  to a mere twenty thousands. We can't wait to find out. A phrase from Chris Anderson's famous <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/01/ff_newrevolution/all/\">article</a> about the makers movement's next industrial revolution comes to mind. In that article, he describes his own company, DIY Drones, as a typical small, family-run business, initially run by Anderson's garage. Then he adds:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<div>But the difference between this kind of small business and the dry cleaners and corner shops that make up the majority of micro-enterprise in the country is that we\u2019re global and high tech. Two-thirds of our sales come from outside the US, and our products compete at the low end with defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Although we don\u2019t employ many people or make much money, our basic model is to lower the cost of technology by a factor of 10 (mostly by not charging for intellectual property). [...] When you take an order of magnitude out of pricing in any market, you can radically reshape it, bringing in more and different customers.</div>\n\n</blockquote>\n\nThis describes accurately what we are trying to do to consulting. We are tiny, barely starting to bootstrap from sweat equity, and yet we are already <strong>global</strong> \u2013 we are doing work in Armenia, Egypt, Georgia, Germany, Italy, the UK; we are negotiating deals in South Africa, Sweden, Uganda, the United Arab Emirates; we participate in conferences in places like Thailand and Montenegro (not to mention the fact that our community lives in 40 countries). We are resolutely <strong>open</strong>, both in content an in software, hence we don't charge for intellectual property. And yes, we are <strong>cheap</strong>, and we aim to get people and orgs who do good work, but can't afford to pay for standard consulting, to turn to us.\n\nIf you like this vision, you can help make it come true.\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>If you run a business, a public- or a third sector organization you can join UNDP as one of our \"founding clients\"</strong>: you will be an early adopter of  our open consulting services, and we will strive to reward your belief in us by overdelivering and sharing with you our learning journey. If you wish to find out more about how this would work, just <a href=\"http://www.cottica.net/alberto-who/contacts/\">contact me</a>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>If you are building a project for a better world, or want to collaborate to one, consider <a href=\"/user/register\">joining the Edgeryders community</a></strong>. Be sure to contact @noemi to say hello, she'll help you make the most of the community.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe scan the horizon for UNDP, to discern the shadow of the future.

We can't have everything at the same time for a very moderate budget :wink: Here's a realistic option for what could happen within the runtime of our current projects:\n\n**Focusing on a graph query interface for Discourse**\n\nWe don't necessarily want a graph *database*, rather Cypher or similar as a query language interface to the contents of the Discourse database. That may indeed involve a graph database used as a cache for performance reasons (like RedisGraph, discovered by Hugi) or not (like with [AgensGraph](https://bitnine.net/agensgraph/), a Cypher interface to PostgreSQL data).\n\nThis generic graph query API for Discourse would be a nice feature by itself, on which others could build various other stuff. But, since that would take a good amount of developer time to build to quality, we'd have to make do with a simpler interface for the next two years:\n\n* Graphryder Dashboard would need some major overhaul due to software rot ([example](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-dashboard/issues/23)). In principle it *could* talk Cypher to Discourse the way it talks Cypher to Neo4J now, but the way interface will be different, requiring work.\n\n* Something based on the Tulip desktop application maybe? By just extending it for our purposes? In that case, a web application would follow later. The webkit-in-making might already add components for a few aspects of drawing live / interactive graphs, but researchers would use the desktop application.\n\n* Other ideas \u2026?\n\nI don't say that we *need* a graph query language interface to Discourse. For our current use cases, we could just follow what Alberto proposed, and overengineering is not a good idea in general. I mean, companies can die from investing in \"nice tech\" that never gets used to its potential \u2026 happened to one of my earlier startup ideas for sure. However, if people here think that this is a nice long-term investment to make, it is somewhere near the upper limit of what could be done with the budget we have.\n\nWhatever the case, I don't want to invest *any* precious lifetime or brain capacity into a software that we plan to abandon later. If that's the only option, I'll rather tell our client that we're happy with the dashboard we have and will not implement \"Graphryder Dashboard v2\" and not claim money for that.

Les gens sont las de cela, ils veulent changer, faire exploser le syst\u00e8me, en particuli\u00e8rement les jeunes.\n\nDe nombreuses personnes sont d\u00e9go\u00fbt\u00e9es par des agissements honteux de la part de politiciens qui outrepassent largement leurs droits, et par l\u2019impression que leur voix ne compte pas. Si les gens perdent confiance et ne votent pas, vers quel avenir se dirige un pays? Quel sera le poids d\u2019une d\u00e9mocratie si la majorit\u00e9 d\u2019une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration (ou m\u00eame d'un pays) ne se rend pas aux urnes?\n\nAvec des lignes de parti moins contraignante, les d\u00e9put\u00e9s seraient en mesure de livrer plus spontan\u00e9ment le fond de leur pens\u00e9e.\n\nSi l'\u00e9lu ne fait plus correctement son travail, ou encore d\u00e9shonore sa fonction, de nombreux citoyens souhaiteraient \u00eatre en mesure de pouvoir le mettre \u00e0 la porte sans attendre la prochaine \u00e9lection.\n\nLa cr\u00e9ation d\u2019une Chambre citoyenne qui d\u00e9velopperait le 5e pouvoir (c'est-\u00e0-dire le pouvoir citoyen) permettrait d'assurer l'\u00e9quilibre face aux abus des pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatif, ex\u00e9cutif, judiciaire et m\u00e9diatique traditionnels. Une telle Chambre citoyenne redonnerait aux citoyens la place qui leur revient dans le contr\u00f4le et la surveillance constante et quotidienne des d\u00e9cisions publiques qui les concernent.\n\nD'autres pensent, \u00e0 moyen terme, \u00e0 une Assembl\u00e9e constituante en ligne, comme en Islande, et \u00e0 une constitution r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par et pour les citoyens.\n\nPour pouvoir innover et inventer une d\u00e9mocratie moderne, les citoyens devraient \u00eatre en mesure de choisir leurs institutions, et pas uniquement les politiciens.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-03-06 22:00:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:30.982395", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 315, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74371, "user_id": 5485, "topic_id": 13224, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![Martin-Brynskov|594x690](upload://y0534fK3bq2H09tkoycDNPetuiW.jpeg) \nMartin is Associate Professor in Interaction Technologies at Aahurs University and Chair of Open & Agile Smart Cities.", "created_at": "2020-04-15 10:02:40.965060", "updated_at": "2020-04-15 10:02:40.965060", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 23, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 35.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 51782, "user_id": 4945, "topic_id": 9584, "post_number": 46, "raw": "Hi John,\n\nI speak and read basic French and some Spanish.\n\nI can brush up on both.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nJason", "created_at": "2019-03-18 14:21:22.083126", "updated_at": "2019-03-18 14:21:22.083126", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 19, "wiki": false, "reads": 28, "score": 55.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [51744], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52902, "user_id": 5046, "topic_id": 9705, "post_number": 54, "raw": "Hello Alberto,\n\nI look forward to meeting you (again) at the event.\n\nWhich book are you talking about, is it Swarmwise?

This is in no way <em>mandatory</em>, it's meant to help you and make sure we get everything right on mid-term. You should not expect to have the same level of support when we do it for real -- simply because Luce is with us only part time, and because she will then need to proceed with the official paperwork (and that takes time).\n\nRemember also, you will upload your financial data on the EC portal *all by yourself* [see the footnote below]. Working with Luce now is a good way to anticipate on all this and avoid unnecessary and unhealthy admin panick.\n\n<strong>HOW</strong>.

I had not thought about helicopter money (though it just happened here, but only in the Flanders region, and only for a small sum) \u2013 I guess how consumers react to it depend on their expectations. If you think of it as a one-off, you will attempt not to change your consumer behavior \u2013 except in the case you are struggling to make ends meet: then you will likely immediately spend it to pay a few overdue bills. \n\n[quote=\"petussing, post:2, topic:14048\"]\nFunding least common denominator jobs is very expensive.\n[/quote]\n\nYes... but the whole point of MMT is that \"expensive\" does not matter, because the government prints its own money. What matters, like you say (and Kelton re-iterates several times), is that inflation is kept under control. Kelton claims that PSE *helps* to control inflation, because, by keeping people at work and constantly reskilling them, they keep the economy more productive. Higher productivity, of course, means that the economy can absorb more demand before the inflationary constraint starts to bite. \n\nBoth *The Deficit Myth* and the Wray report discuss the Indian government jobs program and other cases, including that of the Public Works Administration under the New Deal in America, the Expanded Public Works Program in South Africa and the  [Jefes de Hogar](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/993831468741634839/argentina-jefes-de-hogar-heads-of-household-program-project) program in Argentina (MMT economists, like Tchereva and Wray, were involved in designing the latter). None is close to the PSE ideal, though. PSE is supposed to be universal and permanent. \n\nAs for UBI, it appears that MMT economists do not advocate it. Once you have PSE, you no longer need UBI. You can even have it, but at this point it would become a very marginal instrument: most people would take a job over UBI.  \n\nI think I would much prefer a PSE economy (like in *The Caryatids* by @bruces) to a UBI one (like in The Culture series by Iain Banks). Under prevalent conditions, Wray calculates that PSE would generate 24 trillion hours of work a year in the US. We get income support, dispel the fear of economic instability *and* we get the care economy (and eventually planet colonization) in the bargain!

She explained as well the selection process and the means of support that OCI Lab is offering.\n\n**The Third One To One Lab was with @MostafaBaydoun Temple's Project Leader.**\n\nMostafa has just joined the program, for that the OCI Lab team started by welcoming him and giving him a more precise overview of the process and the roles of the mentors and the contributors.\n\nAfter that, we started a discussion about the project to assist him in knowing what will be his prototype.\n\nMostafa has an idea of the services that Temple will provide, namely, trainings, youth support, discussion circles, etc.\n\nHe was concerned as well with the legal framework of Temple, as it can't be social entreprise he has to choose between association, enterprise, or both. Zmorda advised him to consult a chartered accountant or a lawyer to decide.\n\nFor the next phase, Mostafa will be matched with a Mentor to assist him in delivering the first, second, and third offline tasks.\n\n@zmorda recommended as well to write a post on the platform to share an overview of the project with the community.\n\n**The Fourth OTO Lab was with @khadijaouabdelmoumen, the Project Leader of Alphawomen.**\n\nKhadija is an entrepreneur; she is leading an enterprise of business development in North Africa.

Super-duper-senior academic designer, intellectual father of service design as a discipline, now semi-retired and doing the right thing, i.e. getting in deep with cutting-edge projects like this. He is right at the forefront of openness, design and the \"uberization\" of the economy with his brand-new book, (Ezio Manzini, <em>Design When Everybody Designs. An Introduction to Design for Social Innovation</em>, MIT Press 2015 \u2013 <a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-when-everybody-designs\">learn more</a>).\n\nHe can help us do several things:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Make sure we quote the right people in the \"Ambition\" part of the proposal. We are, in part, a design project. We need to prove that we are aware of the state of the art on design, and can make an original contribution to it.</li>\n\n<li>Set up the prototyping phase, and the feedback loop from the online conversation layer to the prototyping layer in the lab and back. Here he will be working mostly with Edgeryders, WeMake and SCIMpulse; perhaps more indirectly, he will relate to LABRI and KITE, as they are supposed make use of the data generated during this process.</li>\n\n<li>Port the process of communities designing-and-deploying care services onto the policy level. Here he will be advising the Stockholm group.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nEzio's involvement will be advisory, not operational. Think Gandalf.

Good to see you again, too!  I think that the system that I see now - certainly in the UK, I'm less well placed to comment on other systems - is somewhere between the two extremes you describe.  There are still a lot of established people at the top who often act as 'kingmakers' (with apologies for the gendered term, although issues of gender inequality are very pertinent to this debate) - if they're your PhD external examiner or your post-doc supervisor, they're in a position to help you into a permanent position and grant you the holy grail of stability (relatively speaking).  (No-one wants to admit this, but I see it, including amongst scholars who are otherwise pretty 'right on' in terms of the academic identity they externally perform.)  Without a 'kingmaker' or other 'patron' (or 'baron'), you're on your own.  Some will make it (and there's a separate discussion to be had about the social and economic circumstances of those who do make it...), but most won't.  One argument would be to simply say, well, tough, gaining a PhD doesn't entitle you to an academic career.  And that's true, but there are bigger issues here related to the knowledge that is produced by early career scholars that is then either lost (because they don't have the resource to get it published or otherwise into the public domain) or it is appropriated by others higher up the food chain (a bigger problem in the sciences than the social sciences/humanities).  There a huge ethical issues here to do with knowledge appropriation, knowledge loss, as well as the socio-economic inequalities that are perpetuated by a system where it is literally still who you know and/or how well connected you are that determines whether or not you'll get a job.", "created_at": "2020-06-17 11:33:21.616384", "updated_at": "2020-06-17 11:33:21.616384", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 312, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 38.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [79023], "is_liked_by": [3, 6504], "is_private": false}, {"id": 57471, "user_id": 5123, "topic_id": 10399, "post_number": 7, "raw": "My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce kluczowy jest dob\u00f3r rozm\u00f3wc\u00f3w.

Even today, I went to provide some nutrition package in a camp area in Pepsikola and the contact person that I had gone along with at one point told the women to be ready for a photo. I made it a point to express to him that I do not want to take any photos.\n\nI did however jot down their names, village, VDC and Ward No. I know this will not suffice for people who are perhaps looking for a better connection to establish in order to support your or anyone's initiative - but at the end of the day, what matters is your intention and if it is genuine, support will just pour it - without asking for photos!\n\nOn a similar note, I also think that we can discourage voyeuristic and insensitive photographing and avoid being all of that, and still take photographs:\n\n1. Ask for permission - the golden rule. There is a culture in Nepal where usually people do not refuse explicitly, especially at such a vulnerable situation. So, we need to be able to get a sense of their comfort level.\n\n2. Certain code of conduct like \"no handing over pictures\".\n\n3. Ask for permission to publish it, or share. Explain the purpose.\n\n4. Storytelling - I guess the main idea behind photographing is telling a story. Don't just post a photo and leave things for assumptions. Tell a story through your photo - after all, it is that part which captivates. Engage with them, not for a photo, but for learnings like you have mentioned in your experience.\n\nI have seen many photos of relief work that do this beautifully and I am sure they are not doing this purely for funding or evidence, but because that particular moment needed to be captured - to be shared.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-03 17:28:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:30.226797", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 344, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10574, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3450, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>No go</b>\n\n:-(\n\n", "created_at": "2014-10-29 09:27:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:00.692720", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60229, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 10952, "post_number": 1, "raw": "@soenke\n![10340_2|120x120](upload://bnXJEExlXAVlEaffuZnUczTfSC.jpeg) \n**Media Theorist**,  **Educator and Researcher at HBKsaar**, **Co-CEO K8**\n\nAs a media theorist, I write, teach, curate, with a focus on collaborative arts-and-technology research.

This makes it hard to do things asynchronously as meetings are a natural part of the \"ritual\". How can we keep these necessary evils, whilst also going further down the remote/distributed route ourselves?\n\nThis question made me realize that, in Edgeryders, we have been doing a bit of proselitizing with our own clients/collaborators. We use a mix of sticks (to discourage bad practice) and carrots (to seduce them into adopting good ones).\n\nStick: \"No, we can't have a meeting this afternoon. \"e need to schedule a meeting a minimum of five days in advance. This will also allow everyone to prepare \u2013 surely you, too, want to prepare it well!\" \n\nCarrot: \"Here is a 1.5 page meeting minutes, written in decent English (or other working language), in full sentences and with no spelling mistakes.\"  <br /><br /> **Please, tell us about the best remote work experience you had up to this point: ** <br /> Too many to count!  <br /><br /> **What are the most common problems/challenges you face with remote work in your organisation? ** <br /> Sometimes people want new tools, but introducing a new tool is quite disruptive if not everyone is willing to adopt. It's hard to find a middle ground that will let adopters experiment, without non-consensually breaking the workflow of the non-adopters. <br /><br /> **On what kind of projects do you work?** <br /> Mostly research.  <br /><br /> **How big is your organisation?

I do, in theory, but others in the org are better than me at this, so I just trust them. <br /><br /> **What would be a reasonable budget for your team or organisation to invest into lowering risk of burnout of staff?

And we want people to take action: we want them to share their stories. \n\nSo, part of my task is to figure out, **what could be in it for them**. Right now we have the financial reward, but that's all the way at the bottom (and it's honestly not the best incentive). \n\nAnother important part is **trust**. How we incorporate this, we'll (I) have to think about a bit more. \n\nNow, I'll probably share a whole lot more in the future, Ineed to start prioritizing what needs to be done first, but one simple rule journalist follow to get the message across: use simple words. And the introduction to Welbbeing, for example, already has too many \"difficult\" words:\n\n_We are on a **journey** to help one another to find the right ways to **navigate** the changes that are happening in Europe. How are we **building good lives** against a **backdrop** of massive social, economic, political challenges? How are we **creating opportunities** for ourselves and where can we support one another better? In work, health, family, community life._\n\nAnd, from this text - as an example - I don't understand \n1. what I should do\n2. why I should to it (broad ideas about how the end of the world is coming aren't helping, we need very specific examples that people can relate to)\n3. what is being done with what I do\n4. why should I trust you\n5. what is being done with what I do\n\nSo, what would be really helpful is if all the community managers could write in a comment here, how they explain what the project is when they are talking with people: what do you say to convince them - even if it is situational, please add it (and note the situation). I'll take all of that, plus what's on the platform already, and I'll try to craft it into something that makes sense.\n\nWhen it comes to publishing editorialized content, I think @nadia and I will have more conversations about what this would look like. \n\nIn terms of editing stories, we should come up with a system that works: \n- either asking people if we can edit their stories and show ti to them for approval\n- adding a short lead to the story only, a small introduction helping people to engage with the story\n- or rewriting the story but publishing it as a stand alone piece, or merging several stories into one engaging article\n \n\n@anon82932460 are having a call tomorrow to try to harmonize what we're both doing, and feel free to at anytime jump in and let me know what you'd need.", "created_at": "2019-06-06 16:49:16.473765", "updated_at": "2019-06-06 16:49:16.473765", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 716, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 22.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59462, "user_id": 4986, "topic_id": 10802, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Ok! to all tagged, we'll do call at 16:00 Brussels time.

I am also coordinating our Culture Squad - http://culturesquad.org and I wish we take some of the things we've learned over the years about innovation into culture, which is a field severely underfunded and unnecessarily competitive! That could be building better platforms for network sharing, supporting networks like TEH and its members to act together as a community - more shared projects and more shared reources.  Would you like to think with me about that? \n\n2.\nI am trying to reconcile a crisis of values. The reasons to stay for a long time in Romania were because my family and close support system were very warm, I had a loving partner there. And my friends are good friends, it\u2019s just that a clash of values is not something to ignore - even if you dont discuss politics, you may want to travel differently, eat and consume differently, and so it spills into all areas of social life. You can\u2019t ignore it. \nThe pull factor, to be honest, was the mental transition as I was nearing 30. \n\nI need help with... Understanding what you put in your work and what part of you needs to stay private and healthy.

We were setting all up, so I can continue to share info and knowledge that way while we are in quarantine\u2026and we had a lot of fun! It seems like the good way to have the full attention of your teenager for al least 10 or 15 minutes, but the topics also need to be inspiring for them too :-)*\n\n## \u201cWhat are you doing in life?\u201d \n\nWork status follows just a part of my doing :). As a mum of two boys, both almost teenagers, a lot of doing is faced towards them. I am also an architect and a project manager of The National Green Roof Asociation in Serbia. During my 12 years of architectural practice, I have focused on rethinking urban development as it shows today. Questioning primarily on how to bring nature closer to people.\n\nAll the activities that I have planned, such as seminars and workshops regarding urban nature especially green roof and wall implementation, need to be delayed. At the moment, I am thinking about how to make our website more interactive and with more options to make the ongoing changes. Also, I am considering making short videos and sharing them through our channels in order to continue working on raising awareness about the high importance of urban nature/green infrastructure\u2026 \n\n## \u201cWhat worries you the most about your situation now?\u201d\n\nIt is a greatly challenging time. Primarily because we don't have an idea what the future brings, how this pandemic status will affect our life once it is over (whenever it is...). Also, we can not rely on any help now. At this very moment, we are being absolutely in charge of everything, the microenvironment that we are closed in, health, proper food, good education, bills to pay, energy level, the atmosphere, etc. with very few things that we can change or influence.\nTherefore, for those who are entrepreneurs and/or a single parent, this situation brings the most difficult, existential issues. Since this state of emergency started, I keep asking myself what can I do to help those who need help now.\n\n## \u201cWhat makes you hopeful about the future?\u201d\n\nI believe that we will all learn a lot (starting from the basic insights on how much our everyday actions are sustainable!!!, to that question of being in the present moment.). Hopefully, we will go out with new skills.\nAdditionally, we all go through different phases of our life. The fact that more women are being \u201cstuck\u201d now hopefully doesn\u2019t refer to going back. This is just where our energy is needed the most at this very moment. To heal and to uplift others too. I rely on open communication, calls to action, and bringing awareness on what we as human beings are responsible for.\n\n## \u201cIf you are becoming more communal or not, are you going to do things differently? which ones?\u201d\n\nThis question brings me back to the first part. Since this state of emergency started, I keep asking myself **what can I do to help those who need help now.** At this very it is far more about we than me. I will share my knowledge as much as possible, without worrying about the perfection of my words, or other actions.\n\n-------------\n\n* *a lesson that life is teaching you:* The question of being in the present moment - How we skipped that lesson and when? Meditation brings back peace in a chaotic mind, and I believe that it is what we miss and need the most now. I would recommend meditations and books from Dr. Shefali, especially for parents.

My impression is that most co-working places are also still 1-2 generation only, but maybe that can change with the inclusion of childcare and such as discussed in this session as well. \n\nDoes anyone know of actively \"generational-inclusive\" coworking places? <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-08-27 08:26:41.475474", "updated_at": "2020-08-27 08:26:41.475474", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 99, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34634, "user_id": 3815, "topic_id": 6752, "post_number": 3, "raw": "yeyyyyy happy you're here too. yalla let's start thinking about it", "created_at": "2017-08-23 16:10:01.792997", "updated_at": "2017-08-23 16:10:01.792997", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 13, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 3.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [34629], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82456, "user_id": 6455, "topic_id": 14267, "post_number": 6, "raw": "![marcela-rogante-xfPpB7Pe8NA-unsplash|690x460](upload://aNoIldpkOGuhMW6I4tUQXn9YBvK.jpeg) \n\n\n[Marcela Rogante](https://unsplash.com/@marchuri) work on Unsplash", "created_at": "2020-08-28 13:38:06.314937", "updated_at": "2020-08-28 13:38:06.314937", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 17, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [82391], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4675, "user_id": 2657, "topic_id": 4642, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<span><span>Dear friends,</span></span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span><span>we are happy to invite you to the </span><span>Future Makers youth initiative gathering in Kyiv</span><span>, on the </span><span>24th of July</span><span>.

I b\u00f6rjan av 00-talet var jag h\u00e4r. Bra tillf\u00e4lle att lyssna p\u00e5 m\u00e4nniskor och se vart utvecklingen \u00e4r p\u00e5 v\u00e4g.\n\nVi p\u00e5 IVA startar nya projekt som handlar om digitalisering f\u00f6r v\u00e4lf\u00e4rd.

Nu \u00e4r det om Ai och vart det ska ta v\u00e4gen,. F\u00f6r 20 \u00e5r sedan handlade det om webben och vilka m\u00f6jligheter det kan f\u00f6ra med sig. D\u00e4r \u00e4r vi nu.\n\nSatt med i SVT:s Rapport morgon n\u00e4r jag kom tillbaka fr\u00e5n Japan \u00e5r 2000. Eva Hamilton var reporter.

Det g\u00e5r fram\u00e5t med raska steg. Det \u00e4r i b\u00f6rjan av sin utveckling, egentligen. Det finns mycket kvar att g\u00f6ra. Mycket sp\u00e4nnande. \u00c4r man med och f\u00f6rs\u00f6ker bidra med sunt f\u00f6rnuft och p\u00e5 ett klokt s\u00e4tt kan man bidra till att det blir mer hoppfullt.\n\nN\u00e5gra s\u00e4rskilda tekniker.

Den diskussionen k\u00e4nns helt r\u00e4tt. Lyssnade nyss p\u00e5 en politiker. Det m\u00e5ste g\u00f6ras precis s\u00e5, sade han. Hoppfullt att h\u00f6ra politiker s\u00e4ga det. Sedan kom n\u00e4ringslivstoippar fr\u00e5n Microsoft och IBM som bara kunde h\u00e5lla med. De var f\u00f6rv\u00e5nade, s\u00e5 brukar det inte l\u00e5ta.

Om det g\u00e5r \u00e5t det h\u00e5llet, att vi lyckas skapa generellt AI och det kommer ut utan kontroll, utan att vi satt regler och principer. Det \u00e4r ett skr\u00e4ckscenario. \u00c4ven om vi inte kommer s\u00e5 l\u00e5ngt, att onda krafter, brottslingar och skurkstater utnyttjar kraftfull teknologi till att bygga vapen eller g\u00f6ra terroristattentat eller ha ihj\u00e4l folk. Inte sv\u00e5rt att komma p\u00e5 de scenarierna. Tyv\u00e4rr finns krafter som vill dit\u00e5t. \u00c4ven cyberintr\u00e5ng att man st\u00e4nger ner l\u00e4nders infrastruktur, bara f\u00f6r att man kan. S\u00e5dant \u00e4r naturligtvis skr\u00e4mmande och obehagligt.\n\nAng\u00e5ende IVA. det b\u00f6rjar komma ig\u00e5ng lite. IVA har inte varit s\u00e5 fokuserat p\u00e5 IT-relaterade fr\u00e5gor.

F\u00f6rutom att se vad vi kan g\u00f6ra f\u00f6r v\u00e4lf\u00e4rden tittar vi p\u00e5 cybers\u00e4kerhet.

As we also contacted the selected participant 2 days only before the event.\n* The Event Registration Form wasn\u2019t friendly to user to sign up, as the user experience didn\u2019t help them and it didn\u2019t open from different browsers as I got different messages about this. As the form moves to next page easily from mobile that causes that most of participants data wasn\u2019t complete for most of them.\n* The Registration Form didn\u2019t have a direct question which made a confusion in most of the answers and didn\u2019t really filter the participant in a good way. So, I had to get more information in phone to make sure they have an idea and if there is a team and to know more about the idea to see if it really fits the event.\n* The event name prevented too many people from applying as they thought it\u2019s something about environment work more than a hackathon and we are focusing in SDG\u2019s.\n* The SDG\u2019s part make confusion for some people that they didn\u2019t consider this in their ideas. It\u2019s only something solves an environmental issue and they didn\u2019t align their ideas to SDG\u2019s.\n* The details about the prize wasn\u2019t clear. As some participant or applicants see that there is 15 K $$ prize and they didn\u2019t get it will be for all projects. Which when explained some participant didn\u2019t complete the first day or apologized when I contacted them when selected to attend.\n* In this point I written in Egypt event that the prize is between 1 K \u2013 3K $$ as I knew that this will make a misunderstanding but I changed it when you asked for the format that you already made.\n* The time space between session was too much, even with our local session and it was too long to have 3 days event for most of participants which lead us to cancel the third day.\n* People liked @matteo session because it was interactive and they got the chance to work with him.\n\n**Photos**\n\nMedia link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-0X7GDk1aS04VQsw4PxUmTEp_u-QQDo8?usp=sharing\n\nVideo Link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RZLLxOxW4EJ3PzYp5Yc3sy315clE2b-x\n\n![IMAG0039|690x517,75%](upload://oR65G7nOrL4IzePS9prhg3irkqo.jpeg) \n\n![DSC_0148|690x460,75%](upload://syZ3MOqLco2LxEPEeTRMXtuqbne.jpeg) \n\n![IMAG0051|690x517,75%](upload://kXTX78iSCOYdwzWeVprPxd2M1qx.jpeg) \n\n![DSC_0071|690x460,75%](upload://szxgOiDeq7frjUNvhHjZVbLLqnW.jpeg) \n\n![DSC_0178|690x460,75%](upload://memTF7DirZhpQcZpEHZjTco1aLQ.jpeg)\n\n* video file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RZLLxOxW4EJ3PzYp5Yc3sy315clE2b-x/view?usp=sharing", "created_at": "2019-12-04 08:28:26.391633", "updated_at": "2019-12-19 09:04:39.414954", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1203, "wiki": false, "reads": 30, "score": 161.0, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3703, 8, 5771, 5775, 5795], "is_private": false}, {"id": 48198, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 9132, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1f7999373a39095a4531dcbd7de3f75a65f00838.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b68df3b089661418b2ad7c2f90856a3bd9bd55dd.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\nLast weekend Natalia and I went to Timisoara to meet Culture Action Europe, an established network of cultural advocates spanning many countries and areas in between policy and hands on artistic practice. \n\nTheir annual event Beyond the Obvious (BtO) was this year discussing the impact of technology and AI in our societies and online spaces. As expected, the consensus was that the problem with the AI is not the algorithm, the math behind it, it\u2019s the power it yields, and who gets to use it. From predictive policing to fake news and to FuckOff Google, we know businesses and governments are sitting on massive tech developments deployed in questionable ways. That threatens in great ways communities' wellbeing. We are all training sets to this invisible infrastructure. In a grim debate where organised citizens were discarded as a true opponent of giants, it seems we are leaving it to the humanities to question this, to filter things through critical lenses, as \u201cengineers surely don\u2019t spend time doing this\u201d. \n\nBut technological advances can\u2019t be removed from their very birthplace: culture. That provides the context in which they evolve and the locus where they give back. It is culture which keeps on pushing collective imagination and the boundaries of what is possible. I enjoyed learning about the many interdisciplinary works connecting science and arts: city platforming via [soundscapes](http://transcultures.be/en/2018/10/21/secondary-sonic-space-beyond-the-obvious-timisoara/), termoelectric body suits rendering human laborers [obsolete](http://speculative.capital/), constructed humalgae and other beautiful bioart (Slovenian [Spela Petric](https://www.spelapetric.org/#/humalga/) is one to follow). \n\nBtO gathered many people from the institutional side of culture. I found myself in conversations deploring the need for more practitioner led sessions in the event, and a more collaborative approach beyond the rich showcase. For example, we know about the [Pilot Cities](http://www.agenda21culture.net/our-cities/pilot-cities) network aiming to link cultural to social and economic sustainability, but perhaps the stories of some cities would shine more if their civil society and community partners, and not only institutional ones, would speak to what progress actually looks like. \n\nMany initiatives present at BtO were supported through Creative Europe funding stream, a strong common denominator, perhaps more so than work in AI and data. The natural thing people seemed to do was to make use of their presence at the event to build new partnerships. We presented RebelVillage (slides [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DADGxmrFZx8/HaYSpbtBuNLc4eNBjnBxig/view?utm_content=DADGxmrFZx8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton)), our concept for an activist art camp that uses social technology in the preparation and ensures truly participatory culture building. The concept of the project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14O6HuU7vNPJoC4t9V6Mruxu3oFP92RyrIbKWFpaq7GA/edit#). (Heads up: we\u2019re looking for host partners!)\n\nSome people and organisations we are talking to in order to explore collaborations beyond:\n\n* Baltic Sea Cultural Centre in Gda\u0144sk - we had a couple of chats with Lawrence Ugwu, the director of this cultural center, who was very much interested in inviting us to give a workshop at the next year\u2019s Baltic Youth Forum, as well as help develop new ways of doing artistic collaborations and community engagement. They also suggested they could host us. It\u2019s a state funded institution and they run a gothic cathedral, where they host artists and guests and organise events (we were invited to inhabit that space for a bit as well!)\n\n* [Kultura Nova foundation](http://kulturanova.hr/english) in Croatia supporting contemporary arts NGOs - they would like us to deliver a training session on community engagement which would grow the capacity of the organisations that they fund.\n\n* We met people from Timisoara 2021 previous team (!) who had been heavily involved in the bidbook and are determined to roll out new citizen engagement projects, complementing the mandate of the current team and building on the community energies which they had helped build. Some are involved in the Faber community in-the-making for revitalising an industrial area. The next step is to discuss a RebelVillage edition mid 2019. Have a look [here](https://startupstandup.ro/product/for-work/?fbclid=IwAR2N61bZJjJWHfRfKQ-QEbrPnMs5NEe4XdH-XSTuRQCP86pITOIIQWKhJJg ) at the 900 m2 space (and 2000 m2 yard).\n\nOverall, it's hard to say which are the best spaces our Edgeryders Culture team should be in. This being one of the first business trips, there are more lessons to be drawn in the following months, as we continue the conversations. \n\n_Images above by Culture Action Europe_", "created_at": "2018-10-31 14:14:54.734314", "updated_at": "2018-11-25 22:06:47.690917", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 785, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 152.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 137], "is_private": false}, {"id": 83290, "user_id": 6417, "topic_id": 14298, "post_number": 5, "raw": "And here is everything about the Horizon Europe - the next research and innovation framework programme that will launch in 2021, https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe-next-research-and-innovation-framework-programme_en.

The constitution date is scheduled for March 21st 2020.\n\nI learned that this was not the second, but the fourth such workshop. After the kickoff, reported above, and before this one, there were two more: one on the vision, the other on the business model. Materials and notes are in the [Common Ground Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qAiH96_cmK7_Hrm92JJ35E1T5mOtzko4). I have no idea why we have been invited to this one, but not to the others, maybe a slip? I will ask. \n\nToday's workshop was about the governance of Common Ground, the future cooperative. The working language was French, just like in the kickoff meeting. More detailed report below.\n\n> \n\nWe kicked off with a check-in, and a post-its exercise on governance instances (eg. board, auditors) and mechanisms (eg. selection/control of the board, emission of new shares). The room seems to favor very structured, regulation-heavy governance (in fairness it\u2019s a brainstorming session, so a lot of proposed structures might be dropped).\n\nThe distinction between operations and governance is not too clear. The blur is in part due to the long duration of real estate projects: when you buy land, the inhabited building is still 3-4 years in the future. So, they can not always solve by backward induction, from the desired outcome to the present decision; the actors to define the desired outcome are still missing. So, a cooperative like Common Ground may have a *comit\u00e9 des investissements*, which buys land as an \u201cabstract\u201d resource. Each plot will become a part of a project only later. Apparently, CLTB works a bit like ER: the board spawns committees, each dedicated to a project, that include members of the board but also non-members. They are considered \u201cemanations of the board\u201d (Sandrine).\n\nThere seems to be some attention for the issue of projects vs. governance. Can people invest in a single project, as opposed to in the cooperative (Marc)? What about people who live in a project, should there not be a project-level governance? Some interventions (like Marc\u2019s) seem to suggest an ER\u2019s style project sovereignty.\n\nAFAIC, I find it difficult to think about governance without having defined first what the core business of the coop is. Cooperatives normally provide a shared service between cooperators. Which service will Common Ground provide? Today it seems like a cooperative of consumers; people get together and give rise to a coop that will build, manage and sell or rent them their homes.\n\nThe foundation assembly happens on March 21st. On the governance front, several things need to happen. The AoA, for example, and the ROI (*reglement d\u2019ordre interieur*).\n\nInteresting discussion on the participation of public authorities (*autorit\u00e9s publiques*) in CG. Based on the experience of Terre \u00e0 vous, not a great fit, because of the political cycle, that introduces potential instability (J\u00e9rome). An additional problem is that representatives of public authorities in a board can not be allowed to stall decisions by saying \u201cI need to talk to my minister/mayor/whatever\u201d. So, if public authorities are included in the governance of CG, the AoA should specify that they are not supposed to do that. For example, participation to a board could be nominative [hmmm]. Also, board members are not supposed to have conflicting loyalties: the board of CG works for the advancement of CG, not for the interest of the commune, or the ministry.\n\nJ\u00e9rome: NGOs make good guarantors, because they normally have long term visions.\n\nBeverly (?): suggests to adopt rules about remuneration before the constitution.\n\nJ\u00e9rome: there is a way to avoid speculation. Speculation works like this: you make a real estate cooperative. You buy land/buildings, the value of which goes up. 20 years later, you lead a putsch on the cooperative, take it down, sell the assets and pocket the liquidation value. The mechanism is a cooperative form that works like an ASBL: upon cessation, the proceedings from liquidating the assets go to another ASBL with the same goals.\n\nBeverly: is the cooperative\u2019s mission to enable projects for collective living?

This is a lengthy post describing the problem, which ends with my advice on how to solve it in the short term and in the mid-to-long term.\n\n## Background to multi-tenant Graphryder \n\nGraphryder's (\"GR\") current architecture can only handle one SSN (Semantic Social Network) graph at a time. This limitation  propagates through many levels of the [architecture of Graphryder](https://edgeryders.eu/t/graphryder-manual/9517).\n\n* GR's database, the Community edition of Neo4j, can only handle one graph per running instance of Neo4j. \n* The GR API is responsible both for building the Neo4j database and for creating Tulip graphs to serve to the dashboard based on the Neo4j data. This architecture assumes that the Neo4j database only contains data for a single project. Furthermore, GR's API can only be linked to a single Neo4j database. \n* GR's dashboard can only be linked to a single API. \n\nWe have long wanted to make Graphryder multi-tenant \u2013 able to handle data from multiple SSN-graphs at all of the levels above to lower the overhead of setting up a new SSNA-ready project. The hard part of that is making the GR database and API multi-tenant, and that is what this post will focus on.\n\n## An overview of the challenge\n\nThe architecture is currently very reliant on the database only containing a single SSN. To describe why, I will quickly give an overview of how the Graphryder code is structured:\n\n* [**importFromDiscourse.py**](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-api/tree/master/importer/importFromDiscourse.py) is the module that builds the Neo4j database. Classes from this module are called from the settings update routes. This is the class that is called to rebuild the database from scratch from a given set of posts, usually loaded through a tag. Currently, it is only reliable when it is called to  rebuild the database from scratch.\n\n* [**routes**](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-api/tree/master/routes) are the libraries of classes executed when different routes to the API are called. There are approximately 15 different libraries, totalling about 2000 lines of code. Most of these classes contain Cypher (query language for Neo4j) queries to return subsets of the data that has been loaded into the Neo4j database. All of these queries assume that the database only contains a single SSN graph.\n\n* [**graphtulip**](https://github.com/edgeryders/graphryder-api/tree/master/graphtulip) is a library of 10 classes responsible for building the Tulip graphs. These are the data files describing how to draw the graphs on the dashboard. It is about 1700 lines of code in a a few files in the graphtulip module of the GR API code. The heavy lifting in this code is done with Cypher queries. All of these queries assume that all data in the database is relevant to the SSN Tulip graph. These classes are in turn called by the tulipr classes in routes.\n\n## Approaches\n\nI will now go through a few different approaches for how to make Graphryder multi-tenant. We will carry a few assumptions with us on what we mean by that:\n\n* We want to be able to store SSN graphs for multiple projects on a single instance of Neo4j\n* We want a single instance of the API to be able to handle building multiple SSN graphs on Neo4j from separate sets of tags on the platform\n* We want a single instance of the API to serve Tulip graphs and other data to the dashboard for multiple projects\n\n### Approach 1: Multiple databases on one Neo4j instance\n\nThe easiest way to achieve multi-tenancy would be to have the API connect to multiple databases on the same Neo4j instance, and then configure the routes to keep track of which database is being called. Most database-software offer to run multiple databases on the same running instance. Neo4j has not offered this functionality until mid 2019, when it was made available in the Neo4j Enterprise Edition 4.0 pre-release. However, the enterprise version is proprietary and requires a lincense.\n\nAccording to our FOSS principles and operating procedures, this is probably a no-go. However, it's important to note that we would very likely be given a free licence if we asked for one. Startups with <=50 employees can contact Neo4j to receive a free Startup License for Neo4j Enterprise. And if we ever grew out of that bracket, the cost of a licence would probably not make a big dent. In this case, it's our idealism and principles that keep us from going with the simplest solution to the problem. I think those principles are sane, especially considering that investing in software that depends on proprietary software creates a very uncomfortable lock-in.\n\nIt should also be noted that even if we went with this solution, it would still be risky, as it also means upgrading Neo4j to a much newer version which would most likely break some of our code.\n\n### Approach 2: Get rid of Neo4j\n\nNeo4j is not the only graph database out there. There are some open source alternatives. However, most of them don't support Cypher, which would mean rewriting all queries in some other query language like Gremlin. \n\nI recently found a very promising alternative, called RedisGraph. It is a module for the Redis database, which is a technology we already use for Discourse. Amazingly, it does support Cypher. It comes with some challenges though:\n* RedisGraph is very new, and only matured to its first stable release in late 2018.\n* While RedisGraph does implement Cypher, it does not implement the entire range of functions that Neo4j does. Some of those Neo4j exclusive functions, like shortestPath, are used by GR API and would have to be replaced with something else.\n* There is no guarantee for how much of our Cypher code would work with RedisGraph, and we wouldn't find out until we had invested significant work.\n\nBecause of the above, I would say that while it's very promising to use Redis for both the SSN graph and the primary data cache from Discourse, we should not go down that path until we are ready to commit significant resources to rewriting the entire API if need be. It's months of work, and should ideally be split among a team. It's the sort of work we could do if we got a grant or investment specifically for the SSNA tech stack.\n\n### Approach 3: One database with project SSN sub-graphs\n\nIf we're stuck with Neo4j for now, there are ways to fake having multiple databases. In the Neo4j developer community, there are various recommendations for how to [create sub-graphs with labels or new relationships](https://community.neo4j.com/t/proper-way-to-implement-multi-tenancy-on-neo4j/625/8). \n\nThis is the [approach I proposed](https://edgeryders.eu/t/it-development-plan-for-the-h2020-projects/9202/58?u=hugi) and that Matthias asked me to start working on. We agreed on that I'd let him know if it looked like it would be more than about two weeks of work to get it done. After working on mapping that out and some early code trials, I no longer think that it's possible to do in this timeframe.\n\n## Problems with Approach 3\n\nThis is what I have come to realise about the chosen approach:\n\n#### Importing Discourse content is the easy part\nBuilding subgraphs is easy. We would simply have to add a property or label to each node and relationship on import, and when updating we would just delete all objects with that property or label and import again. This basically means reworking importFromDiscourse.py and making it capable to accept hard-update calls for the different SSN graphs.\n\n#### There are more calls to Neo4j than expected\nI had not made a correct estimate of how many different  calls are made to the Neo4j database. I supposed that the graph data was front loaded in a few calls early on.  This is not really the case, there are in fact plenty of calls to Neo4j that happen at various times while interacting with the dashboard that I was not well aware of at the time.\n\nMost of these queries are probably not too hard to update with a clause to only consider objects with a property or label passed to the route. There are just very many of them.\n\n#### There are a lot of routes to reconfigure\nThere are more routes than I thought that need to be configured to be aware of multiple graphs. There is a lot of junk in the code and a lot of routes to consider. When I made my early estimate I thought that most of these were not used, but it turns out that they are, in places where I hadn't looked closely enough.\n\nAgain, this is not hard, just tedious and time consuming. \n\n#### The patterns are not standardised\n\nThe code is not as standardized as I thought. It is pretty clear that different people have implemented different practices in the modules they have developed. One example of this that makes things more complicated is that while the calls to Neo4j in the routes use pure Cypher, the calls in the importer and graphtulip sometimes use the  py2neo library, and sometimes pure Cypher.\n\n#### graphtulip is complicated\n\nAll of the complications up to this point are fixable with time and diligence. From what I can see, there isn't really anything there that I don't understand how to do. It would just take more time than I first thought.\n\nGraphtulip is a bit of a different story. While working on this, I have realized that I don't understand it well enough to confidently dig into it. I would have to first spend some time getting to know that library, which also has a lot of its own Cypher queries that look to be more complicated than those in the routes. \n\nSince Graphtulip is the part of the code that prepares the graphs for the dashboard, GR is little use without it working flawlessly.\n\n#### Bottom line: Time needed is at least x4 what is budgeted\n\nAll of these issues taken together, I think we are really looking at closer to 8 weeks rather than 2 weeks. Even if we had the cash, I don't think it would be a reasonable investment into the Neo4j based GR. With that amount of money, I think it would be a better idea to just start working on porting GR to RedisGraph.\n\nAnd now that we know that it is more complicated than we thought, I also think that putting such a big project on a single developer is bad practice. It would be money better spent to then have two people or a small team that can work together to  avoid getting stuck and to cross-review.\n\n## What now?\n\nThese are my recommendations, pending approval from @matthias and advice from @alberto.\n\n### Short term: We don't bother making it multi-tenant \n\nFor **POPREBEL**, I would recommend that we bite the bullet for now and run one new VPS per Graphryder. This will cost 30 USD per month per Graphryder install. This can also host the dashboard for its own Graphryder install. It is really quite trivial to set it up, if we accept that we will have a little cluster of VPS on Digital Ocean. I can take on the responsibility of running all VPS on Digital Ocean.\n\nTime for me to set up a new GR VPS like I did earlier is not more than a couple of days, tops. I would need to fix a few things on the one I have already set up, but then we can use it as a template and just clone it when we need a new instance. Then all that needs to be done is to update the config files and configure the domain. \n\n### Mid-to-long term: We plan for a big reworking of GR\n\nWith the POPREBEL deadline of our back and a way to deploy GR with VPSs, we should start experimenting with RedisGraph and refactoring the GR API. I am ready and willing to make room for this during the first half of 2019, in a way that allows for some more experimentation and less of a rush.\n\nHaving GR build a graph in Redis opens up for a pretty exciting opportunity, which is to create a complete graph mirror cache of all the data on the platform, updated in real time. This is obviously a completely new feature, but if we wrote a Ruby module for Discourse that could interact with RedisGraph it is perfectly plausible that this could work. This means that we would be adding some powerful functionality, and not just duplicating work done with different tech.\n\nThoughts?", "created_at": "2020-01-06 17:32:43.496547", "updated_at": "2020-02-03 12:54:58.329565", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2168, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 102.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5, 4861], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79291, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13932, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![Data-Economy.jpg](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1d8393ba32d0a3d1d5b59b9858abe3fa46be4d0b.jpeg)\n\nHow do we respond to the extreme centralisation of power in today\u2019s digital economy and the dominance of business models that favour the concentration and exploitation of personal data?

There doesn't seem to be any impact from what I say, and simply being completely informed about each stage of the process isn't enough for me.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-02-29 11:24:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:05.256126", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 125, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52446, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 9584, "post_number": 90, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2019-04-10 12:07:28.930346", "updated_at": "2019-04-10 12:07:28.930346", "deleted_at": "2019-04-14 22:16:43.533400", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 69041, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 11504, "post_number": 27, "raw": "Hang in there, @mstn.

In addition to existing concerns around privacy and security, a whole host of new harms and risks have arisen that requires the attention of computer scientists to find other ways of securing and protecting users, non-users and their environments.\n\nThe negative consequences of prioritising optimisation over user experience can be seen in Google Traffic and Waze, which sends users down surface roads to avoid freeway traffic. They don\u2019t care that this may have an adverse impact on the environment and local communities, or even that it actually may cause congestion over all. Further, Uber has optimised its system to outsource risk to its workers: instead of paying people for the time they work, Uber offers them a system that tells them when they are most likely to get customers, casting ``labor optimization\u2019\u2019 as paying people only for when they pick up a customer, and externalizing all further risks associated with the job, e.g., waiting time, sick leave, accidents, onto drivers.\n\nWhen this kind of tech injustice is applied to public institutions such as borders and social welfare systems,optimization logic and injustices the discrimination embedded in the very systems mean we are changing the fabric of society without having the necessary discussions as to whether that\u2019s something we want to do. We need to stop focusing so much on data and algorithms and pay more attention to the forms of governance we want these technologies to have. It is crucial that the computational infrastructure boosted by all the talk and funding invested in \u201cAI\"serves people, not the other way around.\n\n*Join our Workshop on Inequalities in the age of AI, what they are, how they work and what we can do about them.

We would like to create a small software to visualize the temporal development of a Discourse online forum in a video format very similar to this \u2013 just that this is about the development of the Discourse *source code*, while we want it for the development of the Discourse *topics* hosted in a Discourse forum instance:\n\n<iframe width=\"690\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T7Ncmq6scck\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe software to create this is [Gource](https://gource.io/), an open source tool originally meant to visualize Git repositories. Fortunately it also can read [a custom log format](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/wiki/Custom-Log-Format).\n\nFor Discourse, the custom log file would be a text file with each line containing the following components, delimited by \"`|`\":\n\n* timestamp\n* username\n* type of action (**A**dded, **M**odified, **D**eleted); the \"M\" is useful esp. for wikis\n* path to the affected resource. Usually this applies to files, but in our case it would be about posts. This is the part we'd have to adapt to Discourse. Our path format could be \"`category/subcategory/topic-id/post-id`\" or it could even include the full threading information with any depth of nesting, such as \"`category/subcategory/topic-id/parent-post-id/parent-post-id/post-id`\"\n* color for the affected resource (optional); this could be chosen according to the category color on edgeryders.eu\n\nExample line:\n\n```plaintext\n1275543595|matthias|A|earthos/reef/1234/1\n```\n\nSo the task is to convert the information from the Discourse database to the above log format. This can be done with any kind of scripting. Some example scripts are [here](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/wiki/Custom-Log-Format#custom-log-scripts) and [here](https://github.com/sloumdrone/CSVtoGource) \u2013 there is no framework to adhere to, and nothing that I found that directly works with Discourse already. So let's contribute that and have a pretty cool new mode of visualizing our stuff :) \n\nOf course, we can also create this kind of videos for parts of the Discourse conversation (say, one Discourse category or tag) by adding a command line option to that script. I propose that the script would directly connect to the Discourse database (with a readonly user account) rather than use an API.\n\nAnybody who'd love to take this on?

Especially when a Public Administration try to engage citizens asking them to contribute to a project, it faces the problem to incentivize them with concrete benefits in exchange for their time, effort or behavioural change, signing a sort of implicit \u201cpact\u201d. </span>\n\n<span>Particular attention should be paid to this aspect, in order to avoid misunderstandings and unfulfilled expectations.</span>\n\n<span>OpenCare engages citizens on care-specific challenges and envisages implementing concrete solutions to be co-designed by citizens themselves and prototyped by wemake.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>3 | Inclusiveness </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Different approaches are needed to outreach and engage a wider public, including migrants, the elderly, disabled people and other social groups. </span>\n\n<span>To engage effectively with citizens, one needs to ensure that the process is genuinely open to heterogeneous groups, not only the digitally confident. This must be organically embedded from the beginning. </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>4 | Push approach, not pull </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>To involve people, and in particular specific demographic groups, we need to go where those people are, instead of assuming they will come to us. Instead of a pull approach where for instance a traditional consultation assumes that the people will go the place assigned to be (either physically or virtually) to engage citizens, OpenCare needs to go where the people are really. These are maybe unusual locations for public administration to go.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>5 | Online-Offline balanced interventions </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Online apps and platforms can be useful to engage citizens and collect input. Face-to-face and group interaction is likewise valuable for driving discussion and co-creating solutions, particularly with non-digitally savvy groups. Online and offline approaches also come with different expectations that must be considered. There are many examples of both used for diverse ends. The nature of the online and offline interaction is very different. </span>\n\n<span>Online information enables the quick sharing of an important amount of content and enables swift short reactions, while offline approaches are necessary to reach less digitally savvy groups such as the elderly or less educated citizens that might not be otherwise included. </span>\n\n<span>Offline engagement also allows face-to-face discussions, sharing of feelings and perception, the building of trust, impressions, making a sense of community, sympathy and empathy, as well as co-creation and solution building.</span>\n\n<span>Particular attention should be paid to understand benefits and limits of different settings.</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<span>Timeline:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span>March, 12th 2016</span><span>, \u00a0Milano - Arci Olmi: </span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>Opencare meets an older age group used to dance old-fashioned style (in collaboration with Mare Culturale Urbano)</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span>March, 17th 2016</span><span>, Milano - Villa Pallavicini: </span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>Opencare meets a group of Migrants </span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span>March, 30th 2016</span><span>, Milano - WeMake: </span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>Opencare meets a group of Parents of disabled children (joined to x Vivaio Association)</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t<span>April, 19th 2016</span><span>, Milano - Spazio \u201cWelfare di tutti\u201d: </span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<span>Opencare meets the members of S.

It's a network of coworking space and co-living spaces, hosting both local and international entrepreneurs, who work remotely from Gran Canary in the Canary Islands.\n\nWe started our coworking space out of our own needs. We had a spin off project that needed to be relocated and we had a property available. We decided to prepare that property for ourselves, but as it was large enough to host other companies, other entrepreneurs, we decided to make it available. \n\nWhen we started, we didn't know too much about the whole coworking industry. It was more of a concept of a shared office. And we weren't aware that that was happening five years ago already in our hometown. And that's when we first decided to fully focus our coworking space into digital remote workers. And as this evolved, the second problem that we encountered was, that they needed flexible accommodation, which basically wasn't being offered in our home city. And that's how we started our first co-living, almost three years ago.\n\nThat actually worked out really well. It was a great experience. And it also made our business more interesting. A small coworking space, as you know, it's sometimes hard to make sustainable. Ours was already sustainable, but the co-living actually made the business even more interesting. And that's why we actually decided to invest more resources into opening more co-livings. And we kept the coworking sites the same.\n\nOver time, it evolved, in not only maintaining the original coworking space, but actually opening up three co-living locations, connected to the coworking spaces. But all our co-livings also have a workspace in-house. So, our co-livers are free to work from home, or actually walk over to the coworking space if they want.\n\nI don't think that we are really special. We are just really focused on the value proposition that our city, our destination offers. And again, we are really focused on hosting remote workers. And therefore, trying to solve all their pains, in order to make sure that we can facilitate as much, their [softlanding 00:15:38] in the city, to maintain their productivity as much as possible, and also allow them to engage with an interesting like-minded community of professionals, so that they also feel like home while they are working remotely from Gran Canaria.\n\nOne of our co-living locations, it's a very interesting architecture. It's a 300 square meter penthouse, with seven bedrooms, a very large, almost 600 square meters of rooftop terrace overlooking the ocean. So, the problem that we actually have at The Roof, that's what we call it, is that co-livers don't ever leave The Roof.\n\nSo, even if we encourage them, sometimes you come to the coworking space to connect and meet with the rest of the local community, and other coworkers from other co-living locations, they actually prefer to stay at The Roof, and work from there, enjoying the outdoors. So, sometimes it's hard to make them leave the house.\n\nWe have looked into technology aspects and solutions. The idea for the spin off from our family business was to implement open source solutions for companies, replicating what we have done and implemented in our own company.  Our family-owned business is for efficient tech solutions for hospitals. I have an engineering background I'm always interested in technology.  So, that's why I've always been, somehow, interested in the whole field.\n\nIn terms of technology, I know that many other coworkers that have seen a lot of very, very interesting tools, that could be interesting if we had a larger scale, so if we had larger coworking, or even provided more services.  \n\nBut then, also, I need to explain that, at the coworking space, it was not our primary business. \nWe needed to be very practical, in terms of particularly investing, to make sure that our business was sustainable.  In order for the technology aspect of business itself to make sense, we had to keep our investments shorter on that side.  If we had more skill in our coworking spaces, so if we have planned to open other coworking locations, we will probably have invested also more in technology.\n\nOur coworking location is very small, we can only host a maximum of 30 people at once. We always kept it simple in many ways, although found over time, some interesting tech solutions that solved some of our pains. \n\nIn terms of COVID-19 we are still evaluating how the situation evolves, and to see what the new normal is going to be like. Just look back, and think, how many changes and new regulations have we had over the last three months. If we had implemented, or done things for each of them, we'd be first, crazy, and second, I'd spend a lot of money. For a lot of this, it's not only for working spaces, it made more sense just to close, and wait until there is some sort of near-reality that they can understand, and know what the new rules are.\n\nSo far during this period for us Technology has not helped much more than before because most of the time our coworking space was closed. So, that has been the case for us. And, we will have to see, because we are still evaluating the different measures that need to be implemented, obviously still under a very small rate of usage, in terms of occupancy in the coworking space. So, we'll have to see how things evolve, and we'll have to analyze it, if there's anything else that we should implement, in order to comply with the new regulations under the new situation.\n\nDuring the first period, the first two months, we had to close down the workspace. There was just too much misinformation. The rules weren't clear, and most of coworkers have the ability to work remotely. So, they don't need to go to the workspace. They go to the workspace, because they like the atmosphere and the resource that we make available. But they can always work from home.\n\nSo, as most of them decided to stay home, we also decided that it didn't make sense to have the workspace available. And, we have just recently, two weeks ago, made it available again to current coworkers, and since last week to new coworkers.\n\nThe first measures that we have implemented are not connected to technology. So basically, what we did in the space was, we canceled the helpdesks. So, we separated the helpdesk, and made only permanent desks available, so that every coworker only gets to use their desk. And, there's no sharing of desks. Also, we implemented regulations to make sure that the minimum distance was respected within the space. Obviously made available all kinds of products for disinfection of hands, we have a face mask available in the workspace, if anyone wants to pick one up, because they missed their own. Obviously increased the cleaning.\n\nWhat I see more demand, is to have private offices.  Because of the current situation, a lot of businesses that have decided to leave their office space, want to replicate what they had in their office in a coworking, or in a flexible space. Therefore, request private areas, so that they can bring in their teams, and have their own office space. And also, because of obviously, security reasons, and health reasons connected to COVID. For example  one of the things that I've seen being questioned, are actually the phone booths. With COVID, nobody wants to go inside in a phone booth. They feel that, everywhere you touch, you're going to be infected. There is certainly a challenge around it. \n\nFor example if video conferencing rooms are needed, they actually are needed, and they need to be larger. So, that's a huge challenge for a coworking space, because they have to allocate a lot of space, and it's not going to be used the whole time, just temporarily, for this. And if there's several people wanting to have a video call at the same time, then it's a big issue. There's no easy solution for it. But, we have to see how things evolve. And, eventually, as I've discussed with other coworking managers, I think that we're going to see two phases from now on. We're going to see the pre-vaccine phase, which is the most difficult one, and we're going to see the post-vaccine stage, which you never know when that's going to be. But, eventually the things are going to go back to a new normal, that is similar to the old normal.\n\nWe'll probably have to see what happens in both. And, that's why in other hands, we'll be taking cautious measures, in terms of, we haven't invested in, I don't know, a lot of separations, and all kinds of accompaniments that people are trying to sell now, with the coworking space, because we don't really know how long the situation is going to take.\n\nAnd also, just thinking out with a little bit of common sense. We know that everyone working in the coworking space is taking a risk, unless they wear one of those dry suits. They're going to take a risk, no matter what you do. So, it doesn't make sense for a coworking space manager to invest on daily cleaning, or twice a day, or every hour, or ... I don't know how many different cleaning ratios I've read about ... or all kinds of different tools. Those investments might go into the trash after the vaccine is developed.\n\nSo, we as operators, particularly those who run small spaces like mine, that are hard to make profitable, or even sustainable, need to really be cautious about it, because otherwise ... we're already losing money, because our spaces are empty. If we invest a lot of money that is going to be trashed, that's even worse.\n\nFor us, in terms of technology, what I would emphasize, what has been super important and a lifesaver, it's the access control. \n\nSo, to have the facility on with an app, to be able to grant or cancel access to anyone in our community, to access the coworking space. Also, since we are not there as members all the time, or as managers, the visualization of what's happening in the space, so we have a couple of webcams on each floor, so that we can make sure that everything is okay, and there is no issues.\n\nIn order for our coworking space to be sustainable again business-wise, our coworking space is self-managed, meaning that every coworker has 24/7 access through an app that they can have on their phones. We don't have a member of the team presentially there, or during even office hours. Sometimes I'm there, sometimes one of my colleagues is there, but sometimes there's nobody there.\n\nIn the coworking sector there is some  nervousness about costs, about losing that personal touch, with putting in access technology. But in our case the opposite happened. Because when we took away the artificial host, some of the more stronger community members came forward, and became the host. Normally, new coworkers normally request appointments, in order to be shown the space etc. But sometimes people already using the coworking space take the role of the managers, and actually they are the ones, if somebody comes up without notice, and just knocks on our door, they are the ones who take care of it.  it's better, because it doesn't have to be always the same person. Otherwise, it becomes a job. Right? Imagine that that particular person is busy at that time, on a video call. If she feels that she has to leave the video call to attend the person, then it doesn't work. If there's someone else around, and knows the dynamic ... and funny enough, particularly with the new ones, see another coworker that they know that he's not part of the team, he's just another coworker, doing it, then they're like, \"This is cool. I want to do it too.\"\n\nit's our responsibility as managers, to detect who are those people that don't mind, and actually enjoy doing this. And just engaging in an informal conversation with them, and be like, \"Hey, would you mind doing this if there was the case?\" And normally, the answer is always yes. And it works really well\n\nWe implement the same strategy in the co-living space. And at the end, our way of thinking about this is that we implement the infrastructure. We implement the site services. But, we empower our co-livers, our coworkers to take ownership of this space, as if they were part of it. And that not only solves us a lot of problems, and makes us work less, but it makes them be part of it, and feel part of it. And it works very well.\n\nAlso I think the third tool that has been also for us a lifesaver, which we didn't have at the beginning, was obviously a tool to outmake the invoicing. \n\nSo that, in order to reduce the amount of administrative tasks, and time spent on that, a tool that can generate after monthly, the invoices, and send them, and make the payments easy for our customers. That has been also an important part of the tools that we have used.\n\nIn the short term, we are thinking about just implementing tools connected to sales and marketing. \n\nSo, we're looking into implementing the CRM, and we're also looking into the tools to automate our bookings a step further, so we make them available online. And also, we're looking into improve the access control in the co-livings, as the current doors that we have at the co-livings are mechanical, they are not electrical. And, it's a bit tricky to automate access with those, and make sure that it doesn't become a recurring problem, in terms of maintenance. Those are the things that we are looking into at the moment.\n\nOne of the general  thoughts that I could share connected to technology is, I believe that 5G, so wireless connectivity, will certainly change some of the needs for coworking spaces. Up until now, were a solution for remote workers that couldn't find good connectivity anywhere else. And I think that 5G could actually make that happen. In fact, we'll also probably allow people to work in from areas that it is impossible to work at the moment, like rural environments, et cetera, and with very, very good capacities and capabilities, as if you were connected in an office space.\n\nSo I think that's always going to bring challenges, but also opportunities to the flexible space. Also, connected to COVID, more and more new office spaces being started in rural areas where people decide to move to, but they also want to also go to a space where they can gather with other workers in their regions.\n\nAbove technology, the main reason, at least for us, why customers join our coworking space is, because they want a work environment. Work environments is also connected to community, because if you don't have more people, you don't have a work environment, you just have an empty office.\n\nBut also, to interact, and to generate positive synergies with other coworkers. And I see that this is even going to become more important, particularly because of COVID. I think that more and more communities are going to have to suffer from loneliness, and they are going to need that community aspect. So they're going to look for it, and they're going to be part of a community. And I think that flexible and coworking spaces have a lot to say. And for that, they definitely should be a priority to, not just provide a service, but also care a lot about the community [inaudible 00:25:06].\n\nCertainly we are watching how things evolve, and trying to understand the new trends. For example, one of the things that we are looking forward to, is to open new co-living locations and coworking locations in rural areas within the Canary Islands. I think that will provide a very good experience for those who visit us.\n\nWe've been mostly focused in a rural are here in Las Palmas De Gran Canaria. But right now, because of all of this, and because we see that this is a trend, and more and more people are asking for it, we're also looking forward to develop our network into those areas where more workers are wanting to be.\n\nRural co-livings they already exist in many places, and I think that they play a very important role, and they add a lot of value. But, on certain regions, where there's already a community of remote workers that don't want to work at home the whole time, and they would prefer to go somewhere close in their rural area, where they can be with other remote workers. I think that also, there are going to be coworking spaces offering services.\n\nI am very positive about the future of flexible work spaces, because of their connection with remote work, basically. We see more and more companies worldwide becoming remote-friendly, or even remote-first. And, all that workforce, it's going to look to relocate, or to stop going to the office, and probably start using their closest coworking space, if they don't want to work at home.\n\nSo, this whole transition that we've lived through over the last three months, where we have seen remote work evolve five or 10 years in three months' time, I think, it's certainly going to make a positive impact on the flexible workspace. And there's going to be a lot of new opportunities for operators.\n\nOne of the challenges is to defend the interest of the private sector in coworking. It's very common in many cities, in many regions in Europe, that there is a lot of coworking spaces financed by the public sector. Sometimes with conditions that compete against the private sector.\n\nFour years ago we created the Association of Coworking Spaces of the Canary Islands almost four years ago to ballad together, in order to make sure that the public sector was aligned, and that they were doing fair competition with the private sector. But also, it was an interesting way to connect, exchange, find different synergies between the different spaces that were spread out throughout the seven islands. \n\nIt was reactivated because of Covid. There are a lot of new operators in the Canary Islands. Right now, we have about 70 spaces in total, spread out through different islands. And the interest around the association was really high, as everybody understood that this was a very important time to stick together, to exchange information, and try to create positive synergies together. And that's what we've been up to in the last weeks.", "created_at": "2020-07-07 13:09:19.351374", "updated_at": "2020-07-10 10:06:47.058054", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 3277, "wiki": true, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 80219, "user_id": 6512, "topic_id": 14038, "post_number": 14, "raw": "I consent to this being published in my name/ on my behalf", "created_at": "2020-07-10 09:49:45.094241", "updated_at": "2020-07-10 09:49:45.094241", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59481, "user_id": 3812, "topic_id": 10805, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello Edgeryders people!\n\nIt is been a while since I have written something, but as usual this platform comes to my mind when I think of making something new :slight_smile:\n\nThe first year of ourghema was challenging, and still so as well but things are getting better even in terms of numbers, we have had more than 30 events in our first year, reaching more than 1000 person, we have an aveareg of 20 persons coming per day and guess what? more than 70% from our community are WOMEN :D also when launching ourghema I took a loan from the bank and I am happy to say that despite all the difficulties  next month I will finsh the first year (from ten years) payback of the loan :smiley:  \nAs I believe that ourghema and the space is a process, and that changing how things are going takes years, I decided I am not stoping on just being a cultural and a coworking caf\u00e9, but I am also launching a Fablab in 2020, the very first one in Medenine as well, and this is supported by an association called [Ibtakiroo ](https://www.ibtakiroo.org/) that supported me since the very early stages of the space.\n\nI wanted to share this here and see if you had any ideas that can support the hackerspace? know someone who runs a Fablab? had any experience in one before? \n\nThank you all!\n\nPing @noemi @matthias @alberto  @hugi @nadia", "created_at": "2019-09-17 14:48:52.242202", "updated_at": "2019-09-17 14:48:52.242202", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 243, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 108.2, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4022, 4, 2915, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 74392, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13226, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Thank you for sharing!\n\nhttps://euvsvirus.org/agenda/", "created_at": "2020-04-15 11:11:18.221975", "updated_at": "2020-04-15 11:11:18.221975", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 7.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 65853, "user_id": 5954, "topic_id": 11934, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Vem \u00e4r du?

And since smart cities are a big, big, big market, there are competing narratives here: Are they an opportunity to increase efficiency of energy use or service delivery? A threat to privacy? A bit of both, or something else entirely?\n\nThese are legitimate lines of argument, and there are many more. But it\u2019s important to remember that yes, these lines of arguments really are just narratives: Stories told to sell one concept (or product!) or another.\n\nI\u2019d like to share a few of the more interesting aspects that have crossed my radar, even though they\u2019re in a bit of a complex relationship to another, and think out loud \u2014 and to humbly ask for your thinking on the matter. \n\nIn no particular order, some loosely connected dots:\n\n- Is collecting data for its potential (economic) benefit always worth it, [wonders Bianca Wylie](https://twitter.com/biancawylie/status/1231244118950662146). The implication is, of course, that it isn\u2019t, that there are real risks involved. And also, as someone from the IKEA smart home division once mentioned to me, data can be a liability, because handling data securely takes a lot of effort. How would you argue that for the city? Could it be framed in economic terms? Should it?\n- [SDG goal 11 is about sustainable cities and communities](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-11-sustainable-cities-and-communities.html), a goal to which smart cities might have some value to contribute to. (Complementary, see [U4SSC (PDF)](https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/hlm/projects/SMART_CITIES/U4SSC-brochure.pdf), the United 4 Smart Sustainable Cities initiative that breaks SDG goal 11 down for the smart city context.) \n- The European Commission\u2019s [White Paper on Artificial Intelligence](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/white-paper-artificial-intelligence-european-approach-excellence-and-trust_en) (\u201ca European approach to excellence and trust\u201d) lays out that among other things, one of Europe\u2019s strong potentials for excellence lies in public sector and industrial data that is currently under-utilized but could be harnessed and made available in so-called \u201cdata pools\u201d. Does this apply to smart cities? Should it?\n- When in Toronto the government(ish coordinating body) decided that Sidewalk Labs\u2019 smart city proposal should be evaluated for its potential impact, that analysis was to be grounded on human rights and digital rights, specifically as per the UN human rights principles and the [Cities Coalition for Digital Rights declaration](https://citiesfordigitalrights.org/#declaration).\n- I\u2019ve argued that for data-driven infrastructures like smart city projects, we need a [very high bar to assess risks](https://thewavingcat.com/2020/01/cost-benefit-analysis-data-driven-infrastructure-edition/). Concretely, that the *guaranteed* improvement must outweigh the *worst case* scenario.\n\n(The latter few points also led us to launch a new initiative to offer that kind of evaluation and relevant trainings in which we look at smart city initiatives from, equally, human rights (UN) + digital rights (Cities Coalition), and how to align everything to also contribute to SDG goal 11. (We call it the [Berlin Institute for Smart Cities and Civil Rights](https://berlininstitute.org), and I\u2019m curious to see where that will lead us.)\n\nSo I\u2019m wondering how these things align, how they relate to one another. At the surface, the points mentioned above might imply that I argue against smart cities. I don\u2019t! I think there are real opportunities here: For sustainability, for participation, for government service delivery. But what are the trade-offs, projecting 10, 20, 50 years into the future? These are big decisions we need to make, and make now.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, these are complex trade-offs \u2014 and complicated stories. What are promising approaches to navigate that maze? How can we get there without getting bogged down by party politics or overly simplified talking points? Developing meaningful language for this space is tricky; it\u2019s also absolutely essential.", "created_at": "2020-02-25 15:15:49.392197", "updated_at": "2020-12-09 19:16:14.928964", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 714, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 77.2, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 1856, 4892, 4934], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81519, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13939, "post_number": 18, "raw": "Had a long chat with Niti, she is doing really interesting work with vendors of perishable goods in Kenyan slums.

Then basically in my normal life I worked for about 15 yrs in market and opinion research companies (ipsos, milwardbrown \u2013 being global players- and GPF, Lorien as Italian local agency but much more oriented towards consultancy in mktg, communication, strategy based on surveys , data analysis and social media.) I am also part of a digital start up in SFO called pick1, created by some Italian entrepreneurs. I have worked for the main Italian companies and institutions in the last yrs. at the same time I have contributed to social and cultural activities in Milan and Italy. Now I feel the need to find a kind of synthesis of all this experience that can be board and more meaningful (still being economically sustainable).\n\nI feel I can contribute in several ways (remember I am still full time job with the main company plus advisor to pick1 so I must find a way to have the normal thing I do at the service of ER not adding much stuff until it has become mature enough)\n\nI had an email /gdoc exchange with Alberto. And I ll start from some of the keypoint trying to explain my doubts and questions also in order to be helpful to the preparation of a \u201csale deck\u201d that can be useful for anyone promoting ER everywhere. \n\nLets start from the sale deck issue. Pls find a link here of an easy example. Pick1 is \u201conly\u201d a tech platform for social media pools, so much less sophisticated than ER. Its simple, focused and specific. Despite this its very difficult from clients to understand what is it and above all what to do with it,. Which benefits come from it. So the sale desk try to support the storytelling during the presentation. The use of images is very important to fix things in the mind/memory. The slide don\u2019t tell evry detail and keep some things open, because the usage depend often on the client side (situation, needs) and this is a good tip every time. Keep the \u201cproduct\u201d open..and talking about open consultancy we are already there..but don\u2019t have to be too open or the client comes out with the impression that there is not really its just smoke but no chicken there!\n\nThe Er website is well done and full of info but they must been seek and found . on the other side is probably good for the users and the member of the community but a bit too chaotic for a \u201cclient trying to understand it\u201d \n\nI feel its important to clarify in a 10 to 15 slide pres \n\n1.\tWhat ER do (trying to keep clear but open)\n\n2.\tHow (this very important)\n\n3.\tTry to clarify what is not and not to confuse \u201cconversation\u201d with just \u201ctalking\u201d\n\n4.\tWhy delivers: saying report or consultancy is not enough. Why is the benefit and the concrete take out fro a client (of course there can be several options and level)\n\n5.\tCredentials (council of Europe, cases)\n\n6.\tThe story of Er, Where it comes from, without being too much apologetic. Tis the less relevant because it talk of the past\n\n7.\tWhy different and better \u2013 key key eky\n\n8.\tWho is ER, definition of people, competences\n\n9.\tEventually a knowledge slide with reference to the key ideas, the core scientific ideas (this depends on the presentation style and flow, can be optional) \n\n10.\tCompany profiles, few core info on the company team, legal\n\n11.\tCases done, cases that could be done\n\nThe slides are not enough, people using them should be aware of many hot topics in order to give proper explanation and answer, but at least they help giving communication more efficacy. \n\nIt\u2019s good to use graph, schemes and so on. Nadia coming from consultancy should be already used to all this\n\nSale deck example: \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-3VmoqfFgrSbkNpdkpwM09XcTFwR3NURW10b0UtOVo5U3hv\n\nSo here below some questions or suggestion from a first read/thought\n\n1.comunity description (statistics) , possibly indicate some top profile (anonymous names). Qualify the community, state the value of knowledge in understandable term. Radicalism is a value, it\u2019s not a clear content. What is a citizen expert and expert in what?\n\n2. how it works . IMPORTANT: phases, tools, options, who does what, how much time last, take out. Example: selection of issues, problem, topic, community activation, moderated discussion..Role and commitments\n\n3. who take parts: the ER + local stakeholder + client + anyone willing to do? So how much is public and why. Which are the plus and cons. Probably there should be a typology of different situation along a continuum of \u201cmicro issues \u2013 global scenarios\u201d and \u201cER alone \u2013 ER with local stakeholder or clients experts - ER with all the people who wants\u201d \n\n4. concepts of participation/social dialogue and online conversation are abused, I see you did already a scale of level of people participation is a good image for explanation. Here we must qualify why the coming out of these conversation will be very interesting and useful for the client. How possible to \u201cguarantee\u201d the outcome of a conversation, is very intangible. The number of pages doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n5. which are the topics ER can cover and which not? Examples happened in my life. How much they fit?\n\nHelp telecom italia to define what tio do with about 30.000 old telephone points spread out in Italy which now are not used because of mobile tel.\n\nHelp Unicredit bank understand the new trends I banking retail and services\n\nHelp Unicredit bank understand the development and impact of new form of money..\n\nHelp unicredit or intesa bank  better connect to the local territories in roder to enhance developments \n\nHelp the Sardinia region or Savona provice to define their strategic future being now in a critical economic situation\n\nHelp enel identifying good projects /action to sustain better the communities and the areas where their energy plants created environmental problems.

Which outputs deliver? Probably a scenario setting can be a report a presentation a conference, while the others should become much more \u201cconcrete\u201d in terms of saying what to do and how. Here I really believe that a top down work (even if done with open consultancy) will not be enough, involvement of local people is crucial. Delivery a live community is still something that describe the process. What at the end of the process ?\n\n7. selling is very difficult in time of crises more\u2026in Italy..conservative countries much more..so important to map the influencer that can support ER in terms both of media and scientific publications and in term of introduction/support to potential clients.\n\n8. map potential clients (banks, big companies, foundations..) which is the target?\n\n9. possible to realize a mini pilot on a interesting topic in order to use it to show to all clients or to make a big media case?

In short: we have between 90 and 140m2 over in a durable food hub for fermentation or circular food related projects, and we need to fill it before september :) \n\n![58444204_418181348738312_7418964556778569728_n|690x517](upload://ejESwOlOHQHV7W0FdXWqOpRnX1T.jpeg) \n\nThe long story:\nIn 2017 i opened a shop around fermentation called [Fermenthings](http://www.facebook.com/fermenthingslab) that evolved into a more education and production centered project that is taking around 600m2 in a 8000m2 space called [Be-Here](https://www.brussel.be/opening-be-here) near Tour & Taxis\n\nThe plan is to open by september a total concept around fermentation (that can go from Beer, Cider, Natural wines to Miso, Kimchi, Hot Sauces, Bread or even Kombucha leather, vinegars or Bokachi): a space that welcomes professionals, hobby'ist and consumers of fermented products. For that we have three subparts in our space connected to three values: \n\nAn experience room / Education\nWe will give 50m2 to create a space where projects related to fermentation can give courses, workshops or tasting events. Where you can have access to the ever growing library and buy small batch products from our own production space or from local producers that also take part in the education part. \n\nA test kitchen / Zero Waste\nWith the testkitchen, a 90 to 140m2 we want to give space to starting producers and our own experimentation to grow professional and test new products out. This strongly linked to a zero waste mentality (using the unsold products from the bio market next door, or looking at how the waste of one product can be fermented to become another product) \n\nFermenterie / Local\nSo when we opened our shop, we saw that there was still much improvement in the variety of products offered on the market linked to fermentation. So we decided to start with 90m2 for a fermenterie, where we first will produce Kombucha, but want to facilitate the production of different products on a long term. We want to localise the production of different kind of ferments so we don't need to order from far away, what was the reality for a lot of the products we were having at the shop.\n\n**The challenge:**\nWell at the moment we have a group of people filling in the fermenterie and experience room already, but our test kitchen became a bit empty after one of the projects had to stop their activity for unknown time. So we are searching for project related to Food, zero waste, circular economy that want to share the space with us within this activity. From may till september we are already in the space creating it, so if anybody knows project that would be perfect for this kind of opportunity i would love to meet them. Time is a bit running out and we would love to find a solution for this. It's a quit \"total concept\" in which we really believe, but need to grow our team in order to succeed in every part of it\n\nThanks for reading through, hope you found it interesting.", "created_at": "2019-05-02 07:12:19.968685", "updated_at": "2019-05-08 14:15:56.663423", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 575, "wiki": false, "reads": 19, "score": 763.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63492, "user_id": 5204, "topic_id": 11443, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I&rsquo;m a Dutch guy working in Brussels at the Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS), a left-leaning think tank. Before that, I was at the European Commission where I worked for five years on competition law. I am close to home and &ldquo;far&rdquo; away at the same time, it&rsquo;s far enough to skip the occasional birthday because it's still International.\n\nIn my spare time I love reading, I could actually live in a library. Besides that I love to dance and I enjoy playing the violin.\n\nMy main focus at the EC was competition law and European regulations, especially focussing on the internal market. Questions like, how should we address big companies from a regulatory perspective? How should we deal with transport sectors as monopolies?\n\nWhen I started my studies in International Relations, I was always looking for some truth, but scientific truths aren&rsquo;t really existing in IR. It's very theoretical, but they don't really apply and everything changes when unforeseen events happen, such as the end of the Cold War.\n\nTo me, this wasn&rsquo;t very satisfying. That&rsquo;s why I decided to study law, because there are these rules which you can apply, you'll get to a certain point where you&rsquo;ll find an answer which makes sense. That's why I studied law. And that's why I ended up focussing on regulation. Unfortunately, I never really found the &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; because in law, the courts argue in one way or another: it's not completely consistent.The European court consists of several judges who actually don't agree on many things. The outcome turns into a judgment that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. When I decided to study law, and in particular competition law, is because it was relatively new and still kind of exciting, it's not that established. There's still room to maneuver new doctrines. But I guess always looking for certain truths in a post-truth world.\n\nWhen I was working at the EC, I always thought that there was someone at the top who knows how things work, that there's a grand strategy on how it all fits together. I never found that person.\n\nI started as a trainee at the application law unit. That sounds a bit abstruse, but it means that we were essentially checking whether the member states complied with EU law. There are quite a lot of directives coming out each year. Member states have to transform them into the national laws. And this is kind of a black box area. We don't really know: we come up with all these laws of up level, then we think it's done. But a huge part of the laws, how it's being transposed, how's the entire plan implemented, if it's being enforced. A good example of this is the data protection regulation. It's not that different from what already existed in 1995, the directive on data protection, but it was simply not enforced. So, how can we do better? How can you make sure that the law is not just existing on paper? What actually works? And this is a major problem for the commission: they don&rsquo;t have the staff or the resources to really ensure that the directives are enforced to a significant extent.\n\nAfter that, I moved on to the digital single market. I guess I got the position because I was the only person below 30s with a smartphone. Okay, that's maybe a bit too reductive.\n\nWhen it comes to the Digital Strategies, many people don't really understand what it's about \u2014 this also includes me by the way. We looked at the digital sector for a long time in terms of competition. We started with Microsoft in the 90s, how they sold a pre-installed Internet Explorer browser on the Microsoft Windows operating system. I arrived much later at the Commission. We looked at copyright laws, we looked at the digital single market strategy, at the revision of the ratio of digital single strategy in 2017, at autonomous and connected cars. We tried to define what kind of legislation we needed, to bring it into life in a broad manner. For example Audio Visual Media Services, we came up with a new directive two years ago. It was quite broad, but a lot of it was linked to economic law, and then what we call digital law. This included portability, geo blocking, all from a regulatory perspective. But I think this is very problematic. We wait to see what comes and then we try to regulate it, instead of coming up with more positive, efficient motivational transitions.\n\nI'm not neutral or unbiased to this. But I feel that if we look at the history of the European Commission, when they started in the 50s, 60s, the progressive rate was the future. It was to create an internal market to take power away from Member States and create one common market. The idea was that it would allow for political integration, and would block war: a nice progressive society where everybody would be happy. It&rsquo;s a very good story. But now we're in a different environment: we&rsquo;ve created this huge internal market, but the political structures are not there. And for me, this is a key driver for inequality.\n\nIt's kind of a neoliberal model where they let the markets do what it has to do. And then maybe if there's some kind of narrowly defined market failure, then EC would step in. For example with geo blocking that's the case. And we have many laws and copyrights. Whereas with competition, obviously, you&rsquo;d like to restore perfect competition, but it hasn't really worked. It's a very fragmented approach, in a way a very reactive approach. I understand that law is important, and we should have it. The general data protection regulation is I think a step in the right direction, but it can't be the only thing. You also need to govern. And for me, that means steering investment into a specific technology or a technological application that you want. To use public procurements and all your buying power to steer it all into a better direction: environmentally friendly, interoperable, etc. We're not doing that enough, because the commission isn&rsquo;t willing to intervene in a market like that. It's also difficult because of the treaties, the four key things are the freedom of movement, capital, services, and goods.\n\nOne of the reasons I left the Commission is because it is a quite hierarchical organization. This makes it sometimes difficult to get things moving. There's little room for personal initiative, especially when you're not high up. And it can take a very long time to get higher up in the Commission.\n\n## Creating a Tech for &ldquo;Good&rdquo;\n\nThat&rsquo;s why I was excited to join a smaller team, where you can have more of an individual impact. I was hired, essentially, to take on the digital portfolio. And my main task is to steer the digital transition in a more progressive direction. This means to use digital technology as a driver for young people's aspirations, to reduce inequality, and to create a more participatory democracy. In order words, how tech could be used for the good of the people. One of the items I focus on is data governance. This means access to data, which is extremely important in areas such as Smart City development: a lot of new digital infrastructure is being rolled out, but it's not very accountable. It's often driven by narrow efficiency concerns.\n\nThere's a lot of different motives for people to behave the way they do. It's not just market concerns. It's also solidarity, sociality. And the systems don't take that into account. Governments often don&rsquo;t understand the systems, especially on the local level, they don't have access to the data that's being produced. They outsource the entire management of the systems, the key criteria, to private parties. And I think that's a problem. And I think that if we take a very close look at how we design the infrastructure, we will be locked into long term contracts, with very expensive systems that will decide how people live together in a city for decades to come. I think we have a real opportunity to make this more participatory and more accountable, but we have to take it. The same counts for the debate about the automation of jobs: what kind of work will there be in the future, how can we help people you to find meaningful, remunerated activity in the decades to come? How does it look like?\n\nMany public authorities, and people working on policy policy \u2014 including myself \u2014 don't really understand the systems. But because of austerity, budget cuts, they're very sensitive to the narrative about cutting costs and efficiency. They believe the systems can solve everything, but actually don't understand them. That&rsquo;s why they outsource it without really asking the difficult questions: what exactly is the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve? Can we solve it by just collecting data ourselves and coming up with some automated system?\n\nA lot of those AI systems essentially feed on existing data. We feed an AI data system with occupational roles, and the jobs that people have. This means it will train on data that shows that a lot of managers are male, and a lot of cleaning personnel are female. If you add that data for a labor application, women will more likely get an ad for cleaning jobs, and not managerial roles. The system has learned that it&rsquo;s the most efficient, because that's often what we know.\n\nWhen we talk about predictive policing, it has shown to steer officers to serve the neighborhoods which are well off: the chance that certain people get caught is higher in those. So, you create a self reinforcing loop. If this is how we build systems \u2014by just importing existing data \u2014 it will penalize those \u2014 minorities, the poor people \u2014 and they&rsquo;ll become even more disadvantaged. It&rsquo;s a crucial problem.\n\nI read in a recent report that the Austrian labor department started to use AI to decide how they should spend the resources for rescaling and training the unemployed. And given the criteria, they would focus mainly on people that had the most chance to find a job. What happened was that people who needed help the least, actually received the most resources. Whereas the people that had the least chance to actually find a job again, were left out: it wasn&rsquo;t considered an efficient investment. You need to understand how this tech works, because the institutions using them often have certain targets. Probably the central authority tells them &ldquo;you need to help this percentage of people for this amount of money.&rdquo; The outcome, however, means that the people who need to help the most will get it the least, and the other way around. I found that quite instructive for the kind of thinking that that's happening on a more personal level.\n\nWhat I've seen when talking about technology, is the fact that we don't understand it. When I worked at the Commission, I was also involved in some IT projects. There was no oversight, and we wanted to have system deadlines, increase incredibly overturn. And it's just a sense of helplessness, because you don't understand it.\n\nWe outsourced something, which is not directly related to AI, but which I found quite instructive for myself. When I worked for a certain organization, we had a specific problem: a complaint form, and we wanted to lessen the workload for ourselves, because we got too many complaints and we couldn't handle it all. We needed to find a way to make us more efficient. Under the guise of automating things, it became no longer accessible. We made it more difficult for people to complain. Yes, we put the complaint form online, but we also created a number of technological hurdles. The result meant it was actually more difficult for people to complain, we restraint the options to complain.\n\nAnd this is also a part of the digital environment, you can design exactly everything the way you want it in a way that you can't in the physical world. But you can also inadvertently make it more difficult. For me that was very instructive, because the narrative is always &ldquo;we put things online, we make it digital, to make it more accessible. Closer to the citizen, to be more effective and more efficient.&rdquo;\n\nBut I feel that the underlying trends are that's what matters with technology. It's not the technology itself, it's the socio-economic environment. It&rsquo;s often austerity. &ldquo;We need to cut costs. We need to cut budgets,&rdquo; And the market logic is preparing the public sector. The result is often that people aren&rsquo;t held accountable by the solutions.\n\nYou see this a lot in healthcare and the social care sector where everything is digitized: you can't actually talk to a person anymore. There's often a binary logic, you can click this or that. But often, your case doesn't fit those options. And then you're left out, there's no one to complain to. And it means reduced access. You see it a lot in the US where, once they digitize procedures, the amount of people that are allowed to claim benefits goes down drastically.\n\n## Tech and economics\n\nUnbiased data doesn&rsquo;t exist. There&rsquo;s a bias in the criteria for which these systems optimize. The key problem for me is always the logic behind systems, not just AI, but with the entire data structure we're building. It's linked to the fact that we essentially try to automate humans.\n\nThere&rsquo;s actually very interesting parallels between neoclassical economic thoughts and cybernetic influences that kind of drive the digital revolution forward: the idea that humans are binary. If you look at neoclassical economics, it's just about individuals, there's no such thing as a society. And these humans respond to stimuli. There are certain preference set, they'll try to optimize that. It's a very reductive view of what human beings do, how they think, what they are. And if you look at the cybernetic movement, that thinking is also behind computers, the internet, etc. It's based on individual logic, an individual methodology, and it's very reductive.\n\nData is a simplification of the real world. And that's exactly the same with neoclassical economics. It simplifies things. You have a hypothesis about how humans behave and then you built an entire theory on that, which influences policy-making. In the end, people end up playing by those new rules and behave in a more simplistic way. And I see that when I'm on Facebook, I sometimes feel automated myself in the way I use language, for example. In a way, we&rsquo;re becoming automated. And I think that's the key problem.\n\nWe never regulated a space that we actually could democratically control. With the libertarian origins of the internet \u2014 and the fact that it became really crucial in the 90s, which was the height of the neoliberal period \u2014 we never did anything about it. And that means that all the potential those technical technologies, are being used by conservative forces that already have power. For them, it&rsquo;s interesting to ask how can we prevent people from reoffending. They only want to know which people would do it again and automatically lock them up. For me, this is linked with the conservative bias. These technologies are being used to amplify the logics which are dominant dominant already.\n\nYou won&rsquo;t get the right questions, because if you want to get the right questions, you need to have a new set of people, you need to have a more participatory style of governing technology. And this also means making it more local. These technologies are similar to major monopolies, but they actually govern the infrastructure of cities and communities around the world. They don&rsquo;t know their culture, their language, their interests, their problems. How can they offer an infrastructure \u2014 a system that will supposedly help them resolve issues \u2014 if they don't even know them?\n\nOne of the key examples is Facebook how operates. They pay a lot of money to engineers to come up with a massive one-size-fits-all system. Whereas people actually have to govern to innovate, such as the information which they would like to receive. But it isn't, it's selling us products. People actually check the info that's being put online, if it's illegal or not. In addition, they&rsquo;re outsourcing employees to people in the Philippines who have to make split second decisions about what would be appropriate or offensive to a certain community they often don't know.\n\n## Solutions\n\nI think some basic steps could be taken in the right direction, such as we would in other other areas, such as in the car sector. Before a car comes to markets, they have to comply with quite a lot of safety requirements. The same counts for the construction industry. Somehow, for physical infrastructure and for cars, we have these regulations, but we don't have them for digital infrastructure.\n\nLet&rsquo;s say Facebook releases a new algorithm on a billion people, we could introduce certain requirements. I think that's kind of a basic step. You have some key criteria, you have some transparency, and documentation requirements about how the systems work, what it's trying to maximize.\n\nSome may argue that it would stifle innovation. But I don&rsquo;t think we have to be worried. We saw the exact same arguments for the general data protection regulation. Companies said it would kill innovation. This is dramatic. Now, other countries have exercised legislating in a similar fashion and Apple has made it their competitive advantage. I don't think it would&rsquo;ve happened without GDPR.\n\nIt's a bit dubious for companies to say, we can deliver everything frictionless, we do things that you have never seen before. But when we ask them to explain how their system works to protect certain important principles, suddenly it&rsquo;s completely impossible, its &ldquo;beyond their capacity.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t believe them, it's just not in their own interest. And you see that across the board.\n\nFor me &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; means nothing. It just means new stuff. And new stuff can be good or bad, it can be useless, or useful. If innovation means coming up with better ways to exploit us online and ruin our privacy, that fisn&rsquo;t innovation. Innovation \u2014 abstract from context and important value, where human experience is valued \u2014 doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. I'd like to see technological applications that make sense for us, that makes our life better.\n\nA big question around how to come up with standards in Europe is related to those which don't undercut industrial production and outsourcing everything. One idea is introducing something like a carbon tax. It may be controversial, but we need to have this discussion regarding technology. Europe is a very important consumer market, it&rsquo;s too big for most companies to do ignore. And we saw this with the GDPR.\n\nThat's why ultimately \u2014 and perhaps this radical \u2014 for certain key services, like the way we communicate, talk online, or gather information it perhaps shouldn&rsquo;t be completely private. Companies will try to avoid the law where they can, and especially because a lot of these companies are global, they don't even have that like cultural link.\n\n99% of people passively comply with a law because it corresponds to their cultural values and social norms. If nobody would comply, and it's only enforcement and the law simply will not work. You can never have 100% enforcement, but maybe in the digital sector it's all about shared social norms. That's what makes laws effective, but it has to be based on something which already exists. This is more difficult in an international environment, because a lot of companies, don't share those norms, a lot of companies don't give a crap about privacy or data protection. This introduces some additional challenges for the effectiveness of law.\n\nThat's why I think that public authorities need to be more actively involved and have more ownership of these systems. That doesn't mean per se at the level of the state or the European level, it can be at the local level. Because just outsourcing everything to the market and then trying to control those developments will be very imperfect, and it will be too late.\n\nFor example, the way we communicate and talk to each other, that is crucial for societies and in the private in the past, that has never been fully privatized. So when, for example, when the US became independent, the first thing they did was making the Postal Service a public service, because they understood how important that was for the national community, it had a strategic value. Similarly, for TV, we have public channels which must carry obligations, strict limits on advertising, because governments understood this is important. This is what binds societies together. This is how they share values\n\nMy hope is that people are more willing to accept technological change if they have a saying in decisions. For example, at the company level people could be involved designing what criteria for AI systems. If they understand the purpose and the meaning, they are much more likely to accept it and work with technology. That's what I would like to see.\n\nWe don't know how technology functions. We don't know why it&rsquo;s being used and by whom, and to what effect. Why do I get shown certain ads, why does my Facebook feed looks the way it looks? That would already matter. Starting with basic transparency, accountability, and economic democracy, so the people that are affected by those systems have a say in the way the systems are built.\n\nWe never decided what we want to do with technology and how we democratically want to shape this transition. And I think we can do that.I think then we can see a lot of benefits. We&rsquo;re at a crucial paradox: we have all these technologies, a lot of the have proven that they work, but they&rsquo;re just not really delivering benefits. Especially with regards to important areas for how people live: I still have to go to work from nine to five, even though we have all this flexibility, we&rsquo;re just monitoring it more. I still have to drive to work and I'm still stuck in traffic \u2014 there are actually more traffic jams now in the past, we move slower. We pay more for the same houses. Why is all this innovation not channeled into ways for people to help them live a better life?\n\n## Post a thoughtful comment below ahead of the **[workshop on AI &amp; Justice ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them-19-11-brussels/10326)**  on November 19!\nThis will help us to prepare good case studies for exploring these topics in detail.

I do not want to have to talk to the Project Manager to get her approval for the invoice, and her explicit authorization that I may create a payment queue task for it, because that means waiting for some hours or days for an answer before I'm done with submitting the invoice.\n\nFrom that perspective, the option in your process of just sending the invoice to the Project Manager (who will then approve it, upload it and create a payment queue task) seems better. But it puts all the load on the project manager \u2013 exactly what we wanted to avoid with giving everyone access to FreeAgent.\n\nWhat alternatives do we have? Here's my idea:\n\n1. People upload their invoices to FreeAgent by themselves, and that is all they have to do to submit their invoice.\n\n2. All project managers log in to FreeAgent once per week until Sunday evening and authorize invoices they find there related to  their projects. This is done by adding \"authorized by <name>\" to the description, so that the bills overview list already shows which bills are authorized and which are not. Dynalist can contain tasks with deadlines for each project manager, so reminder e-mails are sent before each weekly deadline (in the next version of Dynalist Companion that @anu is about to finish).\n\n3. The Paying Director logs in to FreeAgent on Monday and pays the outstanding, authorized bills if there are no apparent issues with them. Similarly, weekly Dynalist notification e-mails can be sent.\n\nThis process forces Project Managers to take a look at FreeAgent weekly, which is \"not necessarily a bad thing\" :laughing: The proposed means of expressing authorization could easily be forged as FreeAgent has no version history of bills records \u2013 but the same problem applies to payment queue tasks created in Dynalist. I do not think we need to have a tamper-proof system here at the moment, as forgery would lead to ending a relation with a contractor immediately. However if we want a tamper-proof system in the future, we can easily create one: project managers would add a TAN (a single use transaction number, as used in online banking until recently) to each authorization, and the paying director would confirm that it's a valid TAN of that project manager by looking it up in a secondary access-protected list, and then deleting it from there to prevent double use.", "created_at": "2018-09-22 23:17:32.141403", "updated_at": "2018-09-22 23:17:32.141403", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 491, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 18.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68653, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 12381, "post_number": 6, "raw": "400 words are only enough to explain what the model is about.", "created_at": "2020-01-13 14:05:13.293140", "updated_at": "2020-01-13 14:05:13.293140", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [68649], "is_liked_by": [1514], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47544, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7394, "post_number": 45, "raw": "Ok, go for it.

See reviewers comments [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/field-methods-paper-reviewer-comments/9009/18).\n\nReading the first paper now. It is clear that semantic network analysis as per Jiang et. el. is closely related to semantic networks as studied in Guy @melancon's own work on, for example, analysis of news coverage in France. When @brenoust  developed his notion of entanglement, he was working on such networks. \n\nHowever, the framing and the language here look quite different. For example, if you consider the \"Research procedure\" section (p. 3717-3718) it slips from \"most occurring _words_\" to \"co-occurring _concepts_\". I have to re-read several times to make sure I know what I'm looking at. Additionally, there is the puzzling move to throw away everything except the 150 highest occurring words, which appears to destroy plenty of information without any consideration of how this would influence results. This might be because these authors, unlike Guy and his colleagues, do not like to deploy math to deal with large networks. The semantic networks that Guy showed me are very large. This seems corroborated by sentences like:\n\n> This study used eigenvector centrality as the criterion measure because it indicates a word\u2019s overall network centrality.\n\nWhich looks imprecise to me. There is no such thing as \"overall\" network centrality!\n\n\n Another important difference is whether analysis considers the _keywords_ associated to news pieces or their _text_. The reference to \"stop words\" in the paper seems to point to the latter method, with some simple NLP being deployed at step 1.\n\nAm I wrong? Are there two separate traditions of building networks from word co-occurrence? If so, we should highlight it, writing a \"related work\" section of the paper that would be structured like this:\n\n> * Semantic networks in anthro literature have been used in such and such a way [mostly @amelia] \n> * Network scientists also use semantic networks, but with some differences [mostly by @melancon]", "created_at": "2018-09-14 08:08:32.812392", "updated_at": "2018-09-25 14:38:25.380226", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 331, "wiki": false, "reads": 21, "score": 239.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58970, "user_id": 4986, "topic_id": 10714, "post_number": 3, "raw": "I'll provide one's I'm using.", "created_at": "2019-09-09 14:39:35.632614", "updated_at": "2019-09-09 14:39:35.632614", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 8, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 21.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [58969], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47429, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9013, "post_number": 8, "raw": "FYI, so far I am not convinced that _Autonomous_ has that much economics into it.

I want to share with you my story on how I became a part of this outstanding community. I believe most of you heard about the innovation booth camp that took place here in Medenine in late December 2017. Driven by my desire to change the world around me, I\u2019ve submitted my application, sharing my thoughts about what\u2019s needed to be done to make a change here in my community and what I suggest as a solution. I remember I wrote that people here are not creating any sort of positive change around them whatsoever, except bringing food to the table and supporting their own families. I am not saying this to belittle their effort maintaining a good living but I am trying to point out that we are not thinking about our future as a community, that we need to prepare the coming generation for what they need to face in the future. \n\nPeople here tend to finish their day in any way possible and just go back home. They are not making any sort of impact in their social environment. The same thing applies on children, and that's where the problem lies in the first place. Most of them goes to school and get back home, do their homework and that's it. They don't get the opportunity to manifest their interests and passions, or even to discover them. They are not given the chance to create their own dreams and long term goals. They are simply not familiar with this concept. As a results, we find majority of young adults not being able to figure out what they really want to accomplish in their lives, and if they do, they wouldn't be persistent and determined enough to achieve it. From where I see it, kids should be introduced to the concept of self-growth from a young age. We need to bring attention to this important notion by creating extracurricular activities that are sort of obligatory to attend, where we teach kids the importance of their creations and let them experience how they are able to make a difference in their environment if they work hard enough.\nThis boot camp experience was rewarding on so many levels. I had the opportunity to interact with amazing people, discovering that we share the same ideas and we are on the same wave length. Yet the biggest outcome was finding the courage to start my own initiative: creating a biohacking space. It was an excellent fit for me since I have been having these thoughts and ideas of practicing biology out of the academic context from the day I graduated. Special thanks to @anique.yael and @noemi who enlightened me to this new practice. \n\nWith the same mind set of helping people of my community to start leading their passions and living up to their dreams, I decided to create the biohacking space. It is called \u201cNebras\u201d which means the act of enlightenment. You may ask how this new practice can help people lead a good life. It is simple. When you learn the best way to deal with your own body, you end up knowing what works best for your health for example when you get to discover how your own metabolism work based on your blood type, you can create your food line, thus increasing and boosting your mental and physical performance. \n\n So my idea for this project is to create a Biohacking space where I can introduce Biology to non-professionals, with a focus on kids who would be interested to dig deep into science and really get to the bottom of something they want to understand that has to deal with either their body or their ecosystem in order to help them improve their live. \nI am keen to develop and sharpen my skills and potentials dealing with this new practice. Thus, I definitely need help from expertise, people who have gained a sound knowledge in this new field and here comes the magic of the Edgeryders community:  I got to meet @winnieponcelet here in Tunisia. \n\nIt was a fruitful encounter. We had the chance to share ideas and discuss different aspects of the project. By telling him what set of skills that I think I need to acquire in order to launch my initiative the right way, he pointed out the best practices to lead this project successfully and clarified many misunderstandings that I had in terms of defining the purpose of my project and establishment of my goals. He also shared with me how he started his initiative and the different stages that he went through and what are the obstacles he overcome to achieve his success. All of this gave me a great help to organise my mess of ideas and to try putting them into actions.\nSince then I have been sharing my idea on the platform with the Edgeryders and I had a great feedback. I have had some really encouraging feedback (@ramykim, @alberto), they even shared some knowledge with me such as workshop presentation and spared me some time explaining certain topics (@rachel) and trying to pave the way for me. All of this positive feedback couldn\u2019t be more reassuring for me to continue exploring this world and try to connect it with my real world. \n\nI\u2019m still at the stage of initiation and planning ([Nebras Project Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Xf9ywIB3qUETMgXFv7onCsc0UPWmBg4/view?usp=sharing)). \n What I\u2019m doing now is trying to create activities and projects that can empower and enrich potentials around me by searching and asking people of knowledge and students about their visions and thoughts science and biology now.\nAs far as I know, there is no such community here in Tunisia (biohackers), due to the lack of democratization of technology and the free access to information. Therefore, I need guidance on how to operate out of the academic and business environment in terms of managing and developing the biohacking space, and how to avoid producing concerns and fear of this new practice and to make sure to not develop anything that can cause damage. \n\nHereby I would like to take this opportunity and express my desire to come to the Reef in Brussels and learn from the biohackers leaders such as EKOLI and ReaGent in order to enhance my knowledge and skills in the world of biohacking.", "created_at": "2018-04-05 05:06:33.719610", "updated_at": "2018-04-16 13:22:17.236740", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1084, "wiki": false, "reads": 38, "score": 497.6, "like_count": 14, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4, 3362, 4265, 4034, 4085, 3811, 3703, 1935, 4040, 2915, 4357, 3904, 4041], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49131, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9257, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I also think @brooks might have some interesting leads on this.", "created_at": "2018-12-03 15:40:26.517763", "updated_at": "2018-12-03 15:40:26.517763", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 11, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 6.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49828, "user_id": 2569, "topic_id": 9308, "post_number": 18, "raw": "[quote=\"bob, post:9, topic:9308\"]\nMy feeling that this will work best if the project is 'artist led' rather than 'politically led' and where there is an entirely co-creative process between artists and communities, which is often very difficult to achieve in an artistic milieu.

One has to have a large amount of data to run it against in order, in this case, for the machine to decide what a news story was really about with any meaningful accuracy.

But, since we were at a newspaper with electronic archives going back decades, we were able to accomplish it so that our system was highly accurate.  It was the first - and only - one of its kind.

A group of 10-20 people will engage in a month-long online collective writing process where each act in a character of their choosing, similar to live role playing or improvisation theatre. No specific background or theme is provided, but the story emerges from the collective effort of their characters. A second group of people acts collaboratively in the role of ethnographer, continuously analysing the produced content to distinguish emerging patterns as codes. \n\n## Background \nSSNA has so far not been made on an autotelic or non-instrumental social network, i.e. a conversation or group without a specific purpose tied to real life issues. We believe it would be interesting to see what concepts and conceptual maps emerge from a non-instrumental process. There is several reasons we think this research might be interesting:\n\n**SSNA as an artform** \n\nThe resulting SSNA becomes an artwork in itself, as an abstracted concept map of an improvised process. We believe there is potential to exhibit this project as a freestanding artwork, explaining the process and telling the story. \n\n_How do we display this artwork? A book? Website?_\n\n**Mapping collective narrative evolution**\n\nUnderstand the evolution of narratives in collective processes. Could potentially be relevant research for other collective creative processes such as participatory events. \n\n**SSNA and performance ethnography**\n\nImprovisation theatre has been used as a tool for ethnography in the past, and \u2018performance ethnography\u2019 seem to be somewhat of a discipline in itself. Norman Denzin has written extensively on the topic and an example of it being used is Dara Culhane\u2019s use of improv in her \u201cStories and Plays\u201d project. SSNA is itself a form of experimental ethnography so it makes sense to test combining it with other forms. \n\nImprovisation is also in itself a basis for all culture making. In intentional ways as in example Theatre of the Oppressed (which has been used extensively in ethnographic research, for example Barbara Dennis Unityville project) or the use of improvised poetry as political discourse in Yemeni tribes, but also in every act of procreating and manifesting any culture. \u201cWe are all expert improvisers of the quotidian,\u201d as Bourdieu would have it. \n\n**Testing the limits of ethnographic coding**\n\nA sort of stress-test of the SSNA process in itself, by using it on an autotelic / non-instrumental process the functioning of the coding process becomes more apparent. E.g. in a community conversation about say water management the coding of keywords might be somewhat apparent. Specific techniques, regulations and tools gets codified into keywords. However, there might be certain qualities in the way things are said, formulated and presented that gets lost in the focus on the specifics of the topic - water management. This risks loosing the vital information about how this community works, their flavour or vibe so to say. \n\nIn this experiment the codes will not be limited to specific objects, but extended to also include vaguer concepts such as vibes, writing styles, and more broader general themes. Examples: \u201cgloomy\u201d - includes pieces of content that fits this specific vibe, \u201clinguistically playful\u201d - includes pieces of content that plays with the language itself, \u201cpolemic\u201d - includes pieces of content that goes into polemic against other pieces of content.  \n\n**Letting the SSNA influence the improvsation process**\n\n_Lather (1991) developed the phrase catalytic validity to refer to research projects whose_\n_validity rests, in part, on the effects they inspire for those involved in the study._\n\n## Processes\n\nWe have a number of different ideas around the processes, listed here. Nothing set in stone of course. \n\n**Characters**\n_Character - a contributor of content to the story._ \n\nA group of people willing to commit a portion of their time during one month. \n\nHow do we select these people? They need to be both good writers and comfortable improvisers. Actors, writers, etc.\nIs there a need for a vetting process? (Regarding the artwork-potential of the project a vetting process might be necessary to ensure some sort of quality.)\n\n**Story - Writing process**\n_Story - the full selection of content produced by the characters._\n\nThe writing occur on a forum, most probably a sectioned off branch of Edgeryders. The writing occur continuously, and every participant is encouraged to engage with and produce content as often as they like. \n\nThe content might be posts or comments to post (is there other types of content?). The content need to be of a minimum size to be codeable, so dialogue-style interaction is discouraged. There ought probably also be a maximum size and volume of each writer to not risk creating unanalysable amounts of data. \n\nThe only rule is yes-and which means that each contributor must assume previous contributions as true and valid. This is a common tool within improvisation theatre to keep the creative energy flowing whatever direction it takes, reducing the risk of creative stalling and competing ideas. \n\nThis is not a pass-the-paragrah game since each contributer acts as a character, and the story is continuously unfolding without specific turns. \n\n**Analysers - Ethnographers** \n_Analysers - the group of people acting as the ethnographer doing the coding_\n\nA group of committed people that are willing to put in time to analyse and code the resulting text. This group will work collectively as one ethnographer, using a group chat to collectively decide coding.\n\nThis ethnographer can potentially also act as a character in the story, presenting their result at specific moments, thus also influencing the direction the story is taking and introducing a level of catalytic validity (A phrase developed by social theorist Patti Lather to refer to research projects whose validity rests, in part, on the effects they inspire for those involved in the study.)\n\nThis group will be trained in ethnographical coding techniques, training payed for by Participio (see project plan.)\n\n**Analysis process**\n_Coding of the content_\n\nIn this experiment the codes will not be limited to the specific objects, but extended to also include vaguer concepts such as vibes, writing styles, and more broader general themes. Examples:\n _Gloomy_ - includes pieces of content that fits this specific vibe\n_Linguistically playful_ - includes pieces of content that plays with the language itself\n_Polemic_ - includes pieces of content that goes into polemic against other pieces of content.  \n\n## Project Plan\n\nHugi has suggested to put a small portion of Participio money towards this, that would go to training the group doing analysis in ethnographic techniques. \n\n\n\n## Questions:\n\n**How do we present this as an art project?**\n\n**What would be a good title of the project?**\nShould preferably include 'edge' somehow. \n\n**How do we select the contributors?** \nThey need to be both good writers and comfortable improvisers. Actors, writers, etc.\nIs there a need for a vetting process?

D\u00e4r hamnade jag f\u00f6r 2,5 \u00e5r sedan f\u00f6r jag har starkt intresse f\u00f6r internet \u00f6verlag. Vi m\u00e5ste \u00f6ppna upp konversationen mellan olika sf\u00e4rer och grupper och n\u00e4tverk om internets utveckling och demokrati. S\u00e5 vi f\u00e5r in olika perspektiv.\n\nJag har tidigare bott n\u00e4stan halva mitt liv utanf\u00f6r sverige. Kommer senast fr\u00e5n Montreal i Kanada. Vill rota mig i Sverige igen, i alla fall ett tag. Det \u00e4r kul.\n\nMitt intresse fr\u00e5n internet kommer fr\u00e5n b\u00f6rjan fr\u00e5n att f\u00f6rst\u00e5 hur vi m\u00e4nniskor samexisterar. Intresset var kommunikation. Gick fr\u00e5n att ha b\u00f6rjat studera European Studies, europastudier, till att t\u00e4nka att det \u00e4r j\u00e4ttebra kunskap, men jag beh\u00f6ver f\u00f6rst\u00e5 hur vi samexisterar, skapar institutionerna och mening. Det var en annan bana - kommunikation. Kommunikation idag \u00e4r sv\u00e5rt att t\u00e4nka p\u00e5 utan att t\u00e4nka p\u00e5 internet.\n\nSedan gjorde jag en master i Montreal som hade starkt fokus p\u00e5 hur internetrelaterade communities arbetar f\u00f6r att f\u00e5 fram internet och vad dess teknik ska ha f\u00f6r betydelse, i form av frihet och andra betydelser vi ger till internet och v\u00e5rt varande p\u00e5 internet.\n\nJag \u00e4r j\u00e4tteintresserad av hur vi alltid f\u00f6rs\u00f6ker f\u00f6rhandla med varandra vad frihet betyder. Ett kontextuellt \u00e4mne. Vi har annan id\u00e9 av frihet om vi snackar yttrandefrihet och \u00e5siktsfrihet i Norden j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med nordamerika, men \u00e4ven asiatiska l\u00e4nder och Kiina, d\u00e4r vi har en annan relation till individuell/kollektivitet. Undrade hur vi f\u00f6rhandlar den friheten n\u00e4r det g\u00e4ller internet. De teknikerna som alla anv\u00e4nder. Hur f\u00f6rhandlar vi det? Vilket spr\u00e5k anv\u00e4nder vi? Det resonerar med mig. Tittar mycket p\u00e5 kryptering och id\u00e9n att kryptering ger oss en viss frihet.\n\nJag tror det \u00e4r f\u00f6rsta g\u00e5ngen\u2026 en s\u00e5dan klich\u00e9. Det var nog h\u00f6gstadiet eller gymnasiet, n\u00e4r jag l\u00e4ste 1984. Jag tycker fr\u00e5gor om makt, kontroll, dystopier, auktoritet och kollektivitet \u00e4r superintressant. Id\u00e9n om \u00f6verrvakning \u00e4r en subtil eller dold maktfaktor som \u00e4r sv\u00e5r att f\u00f6rh\u00e5lla sig till, f\u00f6r det \u00e4r en maskin mellan dig och makten. det \u00e4r ingen m\u00e4nniska som f\u00f6rtrycker dig rakt, utan id\u00e9n om en m\u00e4nniska som kan finnas bakom en maskin. Sedan hur det p\u00e5verkar oss och hur vi sj\u00e4lva f\u00f6rst\u00e5r frihet. Det tycker jag \u00e4r j\u00e4tteintressant. Har inte slutat intressera mig f\u00f6r det. Yttrandefrihet, att f\u00e5 t\u00e4nka fritt, samtidigt  hur vi ska respektera och ge lika m\u00f6jligheter till alla.\n\n\n\n\n**N\u00e4r blev du sist hoppfull eller glad \u00f6ver internet eller dess framtid?**\n\ndet finns ju j\u00e4ttem\u00e5nga sp\u00e4nnande utvecklingar, egentligen. Vill inte n\u00e4mna n\u00e5gon specifikt s\u00e5, men just n\u00e4r man f\u00f6rs\u00f6ker hitta l\u00f6sningar till problem som faktiskt \u00e4r problem. Om vi nu ska huruvida till f\u00f6rel\u00e4sningarna h\u00e4r, ska det inte bara vara bullshitinnovationer. Vi har en otrolig kapacitet, egentligen. \n\nDet \u00e4r inte tekniken jag \u00e4r orolig f\u00f6r. \u00c4r egentligen hoppfull \u00f6ver all teknik. Det jag \u00e4r orolig f\u00f6r \u00e4r hur vi v\u00e4ljer att anv\u00e4nda den. N\u00e5gonting som g\u00f6r mig hoppfull \u00e4r att jag ser m\u00e5nga m\u00e4nniskor som vill g\u00f6ra gott och ser teknik som g\u00f6r det m\u00f6jligt. Om vi t\u00e4nker hur vi ska m\u00f6ta klimathotet och bygga ett s\u00e4krare internet, s\u00e5 klart. det finns en hel del teknik kring detta som man kan anv\u00e4nda som vi inte beh\u00f6ver vara s\u00e5 r\u00e4dda f\u00f6r. Om vi tar n\u00e5got mer konkret -trenden att stora teknikf\u00f6retagen, som Apple och andra s\u00e4ger att personlig integritet \u00e4r viktigt. Oavsett om de tycker det eller g\u00f6r det f\u00f6r att beh\u00e5lla kunderna \u00e4r irrelevant. Resultatet \u00e4r s\u00e4krare kommunikation. Det \u00e4r en positiv utveckling, att mer m\u00e4nniskor f\u00e5r vetskap om att det finns verktyg man kan anv\u00e4nda f\u00f6r s\u00e4krare kommunikation och s\u00e5. \n\nDet var en bred fr\u00e5ga. beroende p\u00e5 vilket \u00e4mne man v\u00e4ljer att prata om, i form av nya utvecklingar.\n\nAng\u00e5ende klimathotet. \u00c4ven d\u00e4r finns s\u00e5 m\u00e5nga lager. Om vi ser internet som ett samordnande verktyg d\u00e4r vi kan n\u00e5 ut till fler m\u00e4nniskor, till communitys och prata om klimatf\u00f6r\u00e4ndring, och hur vi kan n\u00e5 ut lokalt. \u00c4ven tekniskt om man med hj\u00e4lp av teknik kan visa upp, f\u00f6rst\u00e5 hur vi b\u00e4st f\u00f6r \u00e4ndra beteenden p\u00e5 ett s\u00e4tt som blir hanterbart f\u00f6r var och en.\n\nJag menar, m\u00e5nga f\u00f6ljer till exempel nyheterna. det \u00e4r inte bra att k\u00f6pa den h\u00e4r varan, den \u00e4r inte bra f\u00f6r milj\u00f6n. D\u00e5 k\u00f6per man n\u00e5gon annan. Sv\u00e5rt att veta vad som \u00e4r bra och inte bra, hur man ska leva. T\u00e4nk om man genom all stora data som \u00e4r tillg\u00e4nglig l\u00e4tt kunde se vilka beteenden vi borde och inte borde ta till oss f\u00f6r att veta impacten. Om vi b\u00e4ttre kunde koordinera och samordna kring efforts. Klimatr\u00f6relsen har kritiserats f\u00f6r att den inte kommer ig\u00e5ng. Det har en uppsv\u00e4ng med Greta, men vad h\u00e4nder sedan? M\u00e5nga v\u00e4ntar p\u00e5 m\u00f6jligheter att g\u00f6ra n\u00e5got, men vet inte vad. Vi kanske l\u00e4ttare kan tillhandah\u00e5lla s\u00e5dana m\u00f6jligheter. \n\nI slut\u00e4ndan \u00e4r det m\u00e4nniskorna. det finns s\u00e5 m\u00e5nga m\u00f6jligheter. Bara en fr\u00e5ga om hur vi anv\u00e4nder dem.\n\n\n**N\u00e4r gjorde internet eller dess utveckling dig arg, r\u00e4dd eller bekymrad?**\n\nJag \u00e4r r\u00e4dd och bekymrad \u00f6ver hur vi b\u00f6r anv\u00e4nda tekniken som finns n\u00e4r fler m\u00e4nniskor blir r\u00e4dda och bekymrade. N\u00e4r vi \u00e4r r\u00e4dda har vi en tendens att bli mer defensiva, mindre v\u00e4lkomnande och sprida mer ondska egentligen, mer hat och s\u00e5.\n\nD\u00e5 finns idag v\u00e4ldigt kraftfulla tekniker. det \u00e4r just fr\u00e5gan om kontroll. En extrem centralisering av information och insamling av data till f\u00e5 f\u00f6retag. Men \u00e4ven den h\u00e4r trenden att vi vill k\u00e4nna oss s\u00e4kra i alla omst\u00e4ndigheter. Om vi pratar om teknik som Ring d\u00e4r privatpersoner vill s\u00e4tta upp kameror f\u00f6r att bevaka n\u00e4romr\u00e5det, s\u00e5 att s\u00e4ga, som inte \u00e4r polis eller s\u00e5, med ansiktsigenk\u00e4nning och liknande. \n\nBiometrics \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 v\u00e4ldigt sv\u00e5rt. S\u00e4rskilt mot utsatta grupper som beh\u00f6ver mer skydd. Det kan missbrukas p\u00e5 s\u00e5 m\u00e5nga s\u00e4tt. Nu n\u00e4r saker och ting \u00e4r mindre stabilt politiskt och mer sk\u00f6rt, s\u00e5 \u00e4r det lite l\u00e4skigt ibland n\u00e4r vi har s\u00e5 kraftfull teknik som man l\u00e4tt kan ta mycket kontroll med. Det ser vi p\u00e5 olika platser i v\u00e4rlden, att man st\u00e4nger ner internet eller andra exempel p\u00e5 hur man \u00f6vervakar eller hittar individer som inte g\u00f6r det de ska enligt auktoriteterna p\u00e5 plats.\n\nDet har inte h\u00e4nt \u00e4nnu att det kommit n\u00e5gon d\u00e4r man inte tycker att de ska g\u00f6ra det de vill. M\u00f6tesplatsen GOTO10 \u00e4r i tidigt stadie, att prova sin id\u00e9 och se vad den kan leda till. Oftast vill m\u00e4nniskor alltid gott. D\u00e5 m\u00e5ste man ge alla samma m\u00f6jlighet att f\u00e5 prova f\u00f6rst och se vad det kan leda till. Vissa id\u00e9er g\u00e5r j\u00e4ttebra, andra g\u00f6r det inte, men alla m\u00e5ste f\u00e5 samma m\u00f6jlighet. I bland har jag undrat vad det \u00e4r egentligen. Id\u00e9er i tidiga stadier kan beh\u00f6va formuleras lite mer. Men har inte st\u00f6tt p\u00e5 n\u00e5got \u00e4n\u2026 jag har st\u00e4llt kritiska fr\u00e5gor och hittills har allt varit v\u00e4ldigt bra.\n\nM\u00e5ste vi jobba p\u00e5 annat s\u00e4tt f\u00f6r att nya f\u00f6retag inte ska vara naiva?\n\nJa, det hoppas jag och f\u00f6retag \u00e4r mer medvetna. Fast break things var inte ett vinnande koncept. Fler f\u00f6rst\u00e5r att man redan fr\u00e5n start beh\u00f6ver t\u00e4nka efter f\u00f6re. S\u00e5 har vi r\u00f6relser som Slow tech, att man ska fundera mer p\u00e5 reglering och alla potentiella negativa konsekvenser som en ny innovation, en ny teknik kan ha f\u00f6r potentiella konsekvenser. Vems problem \u00e4r det jag l\u00f6ser? Vem l\u00f6ser jag ett problem f\u00f6r? \u00c4r det ett problem som jag tror att alla m\u00e4nniskor m\u00f6ter eller om det \u00e4r n\u00e5got jag bara tr\u00e4ffar p\u00e5. Och vem representerar jag egentligen? En liten grupp m\u00e4nniskor och ganska priviligerad. Kanske borde fr\u00e5ga och inkludera folk i den processen fr\u00e5n start. Det b\u00f6rjar fler f\u00f6rst\u00e5. Det \u00e4r avg\u00f6rande.\n\nDet faktum att man pratar om etik i f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till teknikutveckling i studier, computer science och s\u00e5 vidare. M\u00e5nga akademiker har pratat om det under l\u00e5ng tid, s\u00e4rskilt de som inte l\u00e4st techstudier men kanske tittat p\u00e5 tech utifr\u00e5n. Som jag med kommunikation eller mediestudier, man ser p\u00e5 tech ur sociologiskt fokus med m\u00e4nniskan i centrum p\u00e5 n\u00e5got s\u00e4tt. Man m\u00e5ste f\u00f6ra samman de tv\u00e5, det tror jag \u00e4r avg\u00f6rande. Om man t\u00e4nker p\u00e5 fr\u00e5gor om ansvar. Vi har n\u00e4rmat oss den i flera keynotetal. Om piloter till exempel. Man anv\u00e4nder den som en krockkudde n\u00e4r inte autopiloten funkar. Planet kraschar f\u00f6r piloten har inte erfarenheten, men f\u00e5r ansvaret f\u00f6r kraschen. Vi har m\u00e5nga s\u00e5dana situationer - vems \u00e4r ansvaret egentligen?\n\nOm AI, det \u00e4r j\u00e4tteintressant i en krigszon eller som vapen, om vi s\u00e4nder in dr\u00f6nare. Om de inte styrs av n\u00e5gon, om de bara har ett target\u2026 s\u00e5 blir det fel. G\u00e5r m\u00e4nniskan fri fr\u00e5n ansvar d\u00e5? \u00c4r det den som skapat AI:n eller dr\u00f6naren? Eller den som s\u00e4ger \u00e5t den att skjuta? Sj\u00e4lvklart m\u00e5ste vi fundera p\u00e5 de fr\u00e5gorna innan vi skickar ut en dr\u00f6nare. Det \u00e4r sv\u00e5rt, m\u00e5nga tycker att regelverket \u00e4r f\u00f6r l\u00e5ngsamt i f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till teknikutvecklingen. D\u00e4r beh\u00f6ver vi mer dialog mellan beslutfattare och teknikutvecklare.\n\nDet \u00e4r det vi f\u00f6rs\u00f6ker g\u00f6ra h\u00e4r, samla folk inom utbildning, offentlig utveckling. Titta p\u00e5 fr\u00e5gor om hur n\u00e4tet fungerar.

Dionisos and other people were given some mock data in advance (obstacle height, sidewalk width\u2026), and were asked to complete specific tasks as if they were impersonating Minerva\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/2/281b92ecc5429dbc07bfb588ee0e2b6bbad81086.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\">\n\nDuring the tests we received very useful feedback on many different aspects: information architecture, user interface, navigation, text comprehension, tone of voice, need for assistance.\n\n## QUOTES\n\nHere are some key quotes from the testers:\n\n_SATISFIED QUOTES_\n\u201cThe math to calculate the slope is very useful\u201d\n\u201cThe automatic generation of the measured project would solve my issue\u201d\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5ad61200e77644dbd0e70b5bedda47f4f5f84951.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"278\">\n\n_IDEA QUOTES_\n\u201cIt would be cool to have a preview of the filled procedure before downloading so you can double check your data is correct\u201d\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/9/968a963770857c7483b08d15b6bb27bb0c3b5574.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"280\">\n\n_\u201cI DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND\u201d QUOTES_\n\u201cIn the screen where you are supposed to input the data is not clear if you need to take the dimension of the ramp or the sidewalk...\u201d\n\u201cHow do I proceed to the next screen?\u201d\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0f37148e091d8d2f01c5a9b8429d1f05fc9976d4.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"278\">\n\n_UNSATISFIED QUOTES_\n\u201c30 mins to complete is too long time...\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna buy a ramp if I\u2019m not 100% sure it will make me comply to the regulation\u201d\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5e679a6acf9e38da51be1d4e27cb5550c578383d.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"280\">\n\n## USABILITY PATTERNS\n\nBesides what the testers were saying we could observe interesting patterns in their use of the app:\nUser Interface\nMost of the testers faced issues in the navigation, they couldn\u2019t find a call to action when this is below the browser window\u2019s fold\n60% of the testers were able, at first try, to understand and use the interactive elements throughout the flow\n\n _\u00bb Wording_\nMost of the testers didn\u2019t properly read the full text before clicking the call to action, too long\nMost of the testers couldn\u2019t find a significative difference in the description of some of the different ramps one could choose\nMost of the testers have issues understanding which one is the right solution for them, even after reading the descriptions\n\n_\u00bb Information architecture_\nMost of the testers didn\u2019t understand it was necessary to look for a ramp online before being able to input the ramp\u2019s dimension in the procedure\n\n_\u00bb Wishes_\nMost of the testers showed interest in using this tool to fill all of the different procedures to regulate the shop for accessibility, and not only the one for temporary ramps\n\n_\u00bb Preoccupations_\nMany testers were worried of a ramp slope (15%) that, despite its congruity with the regulation, would imply for them to help Dioniso to enter/exit the shop\n\nAll the results above were collected and analyzed. This pool of data gave us a starting point to iterate our prototype fixing the architecture and the user interface on one hand, and take note of details that would need to be evaluated and discussed for a possible future re-design of the procedure in its entirety on the other hand.\n\nYou can also try the final prototype [here](https://pr.to/CK6W6O/) (Italian only) and give us feedback below, thanks!", "created_at": "2017-07-27 08:13:11.645349", "updated_at": "2017-10-04 16:20:54.594314", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 854, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 11.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 75162, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13306, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Hey guys this is going to be fabulous!

If I remember the numbers correctly, in management science, they calculate with 15-25% of non-productive but still paid employee time for on-site jobs, depending on the type of position and work.

That's especially true when they do detailed time tracking with software, because then even the smallest breaks are excluded.

Potem zrobi\u0142em licencjat: promocja zdrowia i zdrowie publiczne, i magisterk\u0119 z pedagogiki - ze wczesnego wspomagania rozwoju i zdrowia publicznego. Uczy\u0142em si\u0119 z przerwami ze wzgl\u0119d\u00f3w finansowych, bo ju\u017c wtedy mia\u0142em dzieci i nie by\u0142o mnie po prostu sta\u0107.

Gdy moja \u017cona zasz\u0142a w ci\u0105\u017c\u0119, przeprowadzi\u0142em si\u0119 do innego miasta, a pracowa\u0142em nadal w miejscowo\u015bci, w kt\u00f3rej si\u0119 wychowywa\u0142em. To by\u0142a praca z umow\u0105 na sta\u0142e, a w moim zawodzie trudno dosta\u0107 umow\u0119 na sta\u0142e, raczej preferowane s\u0105 umowy kontraktowe albo na zlecenie. Pracuj\u0119 tam ok. 13 lat. Zaczyna\u0142em od wynagrodzenia 750 z\u0142, a zarabiam jeszcze ok. 2 300 tys. z\u0142 plus 700 z\u0142 z dodatkami, a od przysz\u0142ego miesi\u0105ca - po podwy\u017ckach - b\u0119dzie ok. 3 800 z\u0142. \n\nW starostwie zmieni\u0142y si\u0119 w\u0142adze kilka miesi\u0119cy temu. S\u0105 zwi\u0105zane niestety z nielubianym przeze mnie PISem. Zmieni\u0142o si\u0119 podej\u015bcie do piel\u0119gniarek, do ratownik\u00f3w, do mojego zawodu, do lekarzy. Zreszt\u0105 od pewnego czasu jest taki trend w kraju, \u017ce likwiduje si\u0119 \u201eS\u201d, czyli karetki z lekarzem, a na ich miejsce powstaj\u0105 podstawowe, z ratownikami. St\u0105d m.in. ta podwy\u017cka: wi\u0119ksza odpowiedzialno\u015b\u0107, wi\u0119kszy zakres obowi\u0105zk\u00f3w. Jestem w zwi\u0105zku zawodowym. Poprzez zwi\u0105zek s\u0105 negocjowane wszelkiego rodzaju podwy\u017cki. Np.: sorty mundurowe, kt\u00f3re nam si\u0119 nale\u017c\u0105 co jaki\u015b czas te\u017c s\u0105 za\u0142atwiane przez zwi\u0105zek. Chocia\u017c my\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce gdyby nie nowa dyrektorka nie wsk\u00f3raliby nic. U nas jest niewydolny wr\u0119cz ten zwi\u0105zek. Te ostatnie podwy\u017cki oby\u0142y si\u0119 bez strajku. Wcze\u015bniej - w zesz\u0142ym roku - by\u0142 powt\u00f3rzony strajk og\u00f3lnopolski, a zacz\u0119\u0142o si\u0119 dwa lata temu. Wtedy zosta\u0142 wyciszony. Dostali\u015bmy dwa razy 400 z\u0142 brutto brutto. I w zesz\u0142ym roku dostali\u015bmy kolejne 400 z\u0142 brutto brutto, czyli 230 z\u0142 na r\u0119k\u0119. To nie jest podwy\u017cka do wynagrodzenia zasadniczego, tylko dodatek. To by\u0142o pok\u0142osie strajku piel\u0119gniarek, kt\u00f3re dosta\u0142y 4 razy 400 z\u0142 od razu. Uwa\u017cali\u015bmy, \u017ce nie wykonujemy gorzej swojej pracy ani te\u017c inaczej ni\u017c one, dlatego nale\u017c\u0105 nam si\u0119 takie same podwy\u017cki. Niestety dostali\u015bmy 230 z\u0142 netto, czyli w w sumie  690 z\u0142 po trzech podwy\u017ckach. Dwa albo trzy lata temu wesz\u0142a zmiana ustawy  \u2013 art. 183 Kodeksu pracy, kt\u00f3ra m\u00f3wi o tym, \u017ce na tym samym stanowisku, wykonuj\u0105c prac\u0119 tej samej warto\u015bci, wymagaj\u0105c\u0105 tego samego wykszta\u0142cenia, nie mo\u017cna zarabia\u0107 r\u00f3\u017cnie. Ze wzgl\u0119du na to, \u017ce piel\u0119gniarki pracuj\u0105 z nami na karetkach, zarabiaj\u0105 na chwil\u0119 obecn\u0105 o 1 500 z\u0142 wi\u0119cej ni\u017c my. Piel\u0119gniarki dostawa\u0142y swoje podwy\u017cki r\u00f3wnolegle. W tej chwili maj\u0105 4 500 z\u0142 na r\u0119k\u0119 po wszystkich podwy\u017ckach, a my b\u0119dziemy mie\u0107 3 700 z\u0142. Czyli nadal jest te 800 z\u0142 r\u00f3\u017cnicy. Nasze wojowanie o t\u0119 podwy\u017ck\u0119 wynika\u0142o z tej ustawy. Tylko przez dwa lata, kiedy rz\u0105dzi\u0142 poprzedni dyrektor, nie da\u0142o si\u0119 z tym nic zrobi\u0107. Dopiero teraz wszystkie pisma nowa dyrektorka wzi\u0119\u0142a i po kolei ustosunkowa\u0142a si\u0119 do nich. Zreszt\u0105 to mo\u017ce wynika\u0107 z animozji. Ona chyba nie lubi piel\u0119gniarek. Uwa\u017ca, \u017ce s\u0105 krzykliwe, roszczeniowe, za ma\u0142o pracuj\u0105. Pod koniec ubieg\u0142ego roku piel\u0119gniarki znowu wszcz\u0119\u0142y strajk w naszym powiecie. W jego wyniku dwa oddzia\u0142y musia\u0142y by\u0107 ewakuowane, bo wszystkie posz\u0142y na zwolnienie. Posz\u0142y do nowej staro\u015bciny, kt\u00f3ra mianowa\u0142a t\u0105 dyrektork\u0119 szpitala. I da\u0142a piel\u0119gniarkom kolejne 600 z\u0142 podwy\u017cek, co przela\u0142o szal\u0119 goryczy. Wszyscy ratownicy poszli do tej staro\u015bciny. Powiedzia\u0142a, \u017ce rozumie nasze postulaty, tylko chwilowo nie ma pieni\u0119dzy, \u017ceby da\u0107 jej troch\u0119 czasu, przyjdzie nowa dyrektorka, zapozna si\u0119 ze spraw\u0105. Rzeczywi\u015bcie zauwa\u017cy\u0142a, \u017ce piel\u0119gniarki zarabiaj\u0105 1 500 z\u0142 wi\u0119cej za tak\u0105 sam\u0105 prac\u0119; \u017ce lekarze na anestezjologii zarabjaj\u0105 200 z\u0142 za godzin\u0119, co w og\u00f3le ju\u017c jest kuriozum, bo my zarabiali\u015bmy 2 300 z\u0142 za ca\u0142y miesi\u0105c, wi\u0119c lekarz za jeden dobry dy\u017cur m\u00f3g\u0142 wzi\u0105\u0107 te same pieni\u0105dze. Przecie\u017c te\u017c je\u017adzimy na karetce bez lekarzy i odpowiedzialno\u015b\u0107 jest taka sama. Na karetce lekarze mieli chyba 70 z\u0142 za godzin\u0119, a my wtedy - 15-16 z\u0142 za godzin\u0119. Dyrektorka sama zaproponowa\u0142a kwot\u0119 dwa razy po 500 z\u0142. Przy czym chyba w obliczeniach si\u0119 pomylili, bo dali teraz po 600 z\u0142, a pod koniec roku mamy rozmawia\u0107 o kolejnych podwy\u017ckach. Ona wysz\u0142a na przeciw naszym oczekiwaniom sama z siebie. Sama zaproponowa\u0142a te podwy\u017cki w takiej kwocie. Nie wiem czy dyrektorka jest z PIS, ale staro\u015bcina na pewno, a przez ni\u0105 zosta\u0142a mianowana. Nie zmienia to podej\u015bcia do partii, bo mamy \u015bwiadomo\u015b\u0107, \u017ce to jest szczebel lokalny. Jednak na szczeblu krajowym troch\u0119 to inaczej funkcjonuje. Tutaj jest kontakt bezpo\u015bredni. Oni chyba nie maj\u0105 takiego g\u0142\u0119bokiego poczucia przynale\u017cno\u015bci partyjnej jak na przyk\u0142ad na szczeblu krajowym ci politycy. Tak mi si\u0119 przynajmniej wydaje.\n\nNie wydaje mi si\u0119, \u017ce moje wynagrodzenie jest adekwatne do pracy, kt\u00f3r\u0105 wykonuj\u0119 ani do odpowiedzialno\u015bci. Jeszcze rok temu by\u0142bym zadowolon. Wystarczy\u0142oby mi 3 500 z\u0142. Teraz kiedy je mam, wydaje mi si\u0119 \u017ce ok. 5 tys. z\u0142 by\u0142oby adekwatne. Ci\u0105gle kolejnymi ustawami poszerza si\u0119 nam zakres obowi\u0105zk\u00f3w, a do tej pory nie sz\u0142y za tym \u017cadne podwy\u017cki wynagrodzenia. \n\nRaz w roku mamy tzw. wczasy pod grusz\u0105, czyli dodatek do wypoczynku w kwocie... W\u0142a\u015bnie. Do tej pory mieli\u015bmy do po\u0142owy uci\u0119te \u2013 do 350 z\u0142, a nowa dyrektorka wr\u00f3ci\u0142a do tych w\u0142a\u015bciwych sum, i teraz mamy 750 z\u0142. To jest p\u0142atne po odbytym urlopie -  minimum 10 dni roboczych, 14 dni kalendarzowych. Nie ma wi\u0119cej funduszy socjalnych. S\u0105 nieoprocentowane po\u017cyczki z kasy zapomogowo \u2013 po\u017cyczkowej, je\u017celi kto\u015b sobie \u017cyczy. Oczywi\u015bcie to trzeba sp\u0142aca\u0107. Mamy grupowe ubezpiecznie, co jest chyba troch\u0119 ta\u0144sze. \n\nW czasie protest\u00f3w nie wszyscy ratownicy strajkowali. Nie wiem dlaczego. Mog\u0119 si\u0119 tylko domy\u015bla\u0107, \u017ce cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 jest zbyt leniwa, druga cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 mo\u017ce si\u0119 ba\u0107 represji ze strony prze\u0142o\u017conych, bo i takie straszenie by\u0142o ze strony kierownika. Tego typu s\u0142owa pada\u0142y, nie wiem czy \u017cartem czy powa\u017cnie. Ratownikowi kontraktowemu ci\u0119\u017cej si\u0119 zmobilizowa\u0107 do tego strajku, bo jak kto\u015b jest na kontrakcie, to on zazwyczaj pracuje du\u017co wi\u0119cej godzin ni\u017c ja. Ja na etacie maksymalnie 168 godzin musz\u0119 przepracowa\u0107 w miesi\u0105cu, a taki cz\u0142owiek, kt\u00f3ry pracuje na kontrakcie, miesi\u0119cznie, \u017ceby wyj\u015b\u0107 na swoje, zap\u0142aci\u0107 ZUS i podatek, musi pracowa\u0107 prawie 300 godz., a \u017ceby od\u0142o\u017cy\u0107 to pracuje po 400 godz. I jemu - jak pracuje 400 godzin - ci\u0119\u017cko si\u0119 zmobilizowa\u0107, \u017ceby p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107 na strajk. Nie ma zwyczajnie na to czasu. \n\nWidz\u0119 mn\u00f3stwo problem\u00f3w w s\u0142u\u017cbie zdrowia. Np.: brak \u015bwiadomo\u015bci ludzi co do zasadno\u015bci wezwa\u0144 \u2013 do czego powinna je\u017adzi\u0107 karetka, a do czego nie powinna.  Ludzie wzywaj\u0105 nas do b\u00f3lu kolana, bo si\u0119 uderzy\u0142 tydzie\u0144 temu, bo si\u0119 przewr\u00f3ci\u0142 i go r\u0119ka boli \u2013 tego typu rzeczy. Gdzie jest jedna karetka w rejonie i trzeba mie\u0107 \u015bwiadomo\u015b\u0107, \u017ce jak pojedziemy do takiej rzeczy, a w mi\u0119dzyczasie stanie si\u0119 co\u015b powa\u017cnego, to ta druga osoba, co potrzebuje pilnie pomocy, jej nie otrzyma, bo jeste\u015bmy na takim wyje\u017adzie nieuzasadnionym wr\u0119cz. A to jest pok\u0142osie tego, \u017ce w telewizji s\u0105 rozdmuchiwane afery. Kiedy\u015b jak by\u0142y wewn\u0119trzne dyspozytorki na pogotowiu, robi\u0142y przesiew, w po\u0142owie przypadk\u00f3w odmawia\u0142y, bo uznawa\u0142y je za nieuzasadnione. W tej chwili obs\u0142uguja to CPRy, czyli Centra Powiadamiania Ratunkowego, w kt\u00f3rych pracuj\u0105 osoby, kt\u00f3re nie znaj\u0105 ludzi, nie znaj\u0105 terenu i przyjmuj\u0105 wszystkie wezwania jak leci. Ze wzgl\u0119du na to, \u017ce telewizja rozdmucha\u0142a \u015bmier\u0107 osoby, bo karetka nie dojecha\u0142a na czas. \u015amier\u0107 zdarza si\u0119 na milion, 500 tys. wyjazd\u00f3w. Dyspozytorzy si\u0119 boj\u0105 i przyjmuj\u0105 wszystko jak leci. Natomiast \u015bwiadomo\u015b\u0107 ludzi jest na bardzo niskim poziomie. Ludzie s\u0105 bardzo roszczeniowi. Uwa\u017caj\u0105, \u017ce wszystko im si\u0119 nale\u017cy, a nie do ko\u0144ca tak jest. Po to m.in. powsta\u0142 NI\u015a, czyli nocna i \u015bwi\u0105teczna opieka medyczna. Taki lekarz rodzinny dzia\u0142aj\u0105cy od 18:00 do 6:00 rano, \u017ceby odci\u0105\u017cy\u0107 pogotowie od takich bzdurnych wyjazd\u00f3w, ale to nie funkcjonuje jak nale\u017cy. To jest zazwyczaj przy szpitalu albo przy jakiej\u015b przychodni. Teraz maj\u0105 by\u0107 przy SORach (przyp.: Szpitalny Oddzia\u0142 Ratunkowy). Tak\u0105 informacj\u0119 o NI\u015a mo\u017cna dosta\u0107 w CPR lub u lekarza rodzinnego czy w internecie. \u017byjemy w dobie internetu, mo\u017cna sobie doczyta\u0107. To funkcjonuje nie od wczoraj, to jest od kilku lat, a ludzie dalej o tym nie wiedz\u0105. Zreszt\u0105 lekarze ze \u015bwi\u0105tecznej opieki cz\u0119sto odmawiaj\u0105 wyjazd\u00f3w, twierdz\u0105c, \u017ce maj\u0105 du\u017co pacjent\u00f3w, a to nie zawsze jest prawda. To jest lekarz wyjazdowy, przyjmuje na miejscu, ale mo\u017ce te\u017c dojecha\u0107 do pacjenta, bo jest ich dw\u00f3ch na dy\u017curze. \n\nPoza tym problemem jest brak odpowiedniego sprz\u0119tu, arogancja i ignorancja bezpo\u015brednich prze\u0142o\u017conych, niekompetentni wsp\u00f3\u0142pracownicy. Pewne problemy jak s\u0105 zg\u0142aszane, s\u0105 ignorowane, przynajmniej w rozmowie bezpo\u015bredniej. P\u00f3\u017aniej przy przy wy\u017cszych prze\u0142o\u017conych, m\u00f3j bezpo\u015bredni prze\u0142o\u017cony udaje, \u017ce nic nie wiedzia\u0142 albo udaje pomocnego. S\u0105 rzeczy, o kt\u00f3rych nie chcia\u0142bym m\u00f3wi\u0107, bo to jednak b\u0119dzie publikowanie. Gdyby to wysz\u0142o na jaw, prokurator by si\u0119 tym zaj\u0105\u0142 pewnie. Ze strony ludzi jak to wygl\u0105da...? Czasem krzycz\u0105 w niecenzuralnych s\u0142owach: gdzie ta karetka? S\u0105 roszczeniowi, wszystko im si\u0119 nale\u017cy, czasem s\u0105 agresywni, czasem pijani. Ludzie s\u0105 r\u00f3\u017cni. Jeden wezwie karetk\u0119 o 3:00 w nocy, bo go paluszek rozboli, bo nale\u017cy mu si\u0119, bo podatki p\u0142aci, a inny tydzie\u0144 b\u0119dzie chodzi\u0142 ze z\u0142aman\u0105 nog\u0105 i da sobie rad\u0119. Na kilka tysi\u0119cy mieszka\u0144c\u00f3w jest jedna karetka. Zbyt du\u017cy rejon jak na jedn\u0105 obstaw\u0119. Si\u0142\u0105 rzeczy ludzie musz\u0105 czeka\u0107 kilka godzin, je\u015bli 3-4 osoby wezw\u0105 karetk\u0119 w tym samym czasie. Nie mamy wsparcia psychologicznego. Policja ma, stra\u017cacy maj\u0105, a my nie mamy \u017cadnego. \n\nNie szukam innej pracy, bo ta mi si\u0119 podoba. Nie wyobra\u017cam sobie, \u017cebym m\u00f3g\u0142 robi\u0107 co\u015b innego. A dodatkowej \u2013 odk\u0105d pojawi\u0142y si\u0119 dzieciaki \u2013 p\u00f3ki co nie mog\u0142em. Teraz aktywnie zaczynam si\u0119 rozgl\u0105da\u0107 i niewykluczone, \u017ce mo\u017ce od przysz\u0142ego roku albo pod koniec tego roku p\u00f3jd\u0119 do dodatkowej pracy. Ze wzgl\u0119du na te podwy\u017cki nie jest to niezb\u0119dne, a chc\u0119 teraz wi\u0119cej czasu po\u015bwi\u0119ci\u0107 rodzinie, bo tego czasu ju\u017c nie odzyskam. Na pewno nie b\u0119d\u0119 pracowa\u0142 po 400-500 godzin miesi\u0119cznie. \n\nOstatnio nie g\u0142osowa\u0142em w wyborach do Europarlamentu, bo by\u0142em w pracy, a chwilowo nie widz\u0119 opcji, na kt\u00f3r\u0105 mog\u0119 g\u0142osowa\u0107. Zawiod\u0142em si\u0119 na poprzedniej partii rz\u0105dz\u0105cej, czyli na Platformie Obywatelskiej. Wcze\u015bniej stale g\u0142osowa\u0142em na PO. Wprowadzili szereg ci\u0119\u0107, co by\u0142o uzasadnione ze wzgl\u0119du na kryzys, kt\u00f3ry przetoczy\u0142 si\u0119 przez Europ\u0119. A potem m\u00f3wili ci\u0105gle o dobrej sytuacji w kraju i nie posz\u0142y za tym wymierne korzy\u015bci dla nas \u2013 dla ludzi. Poza tym z mojej perspektywy wprowadzili tak\u0105 ustaw\u0119, kt\u00f3ra znios\u0142a z pracodawcy obowi\u0105zek wyp\u0142acania dodatkowego wynagrodzenia za prac\u0119 w nocy i za godziny dojazdowe. Wcze\u015bniej to by\u0142o regulowane ustawowo, a oni wprowadzili ustaw\u0119, kt\u00f3ra to znosi\u0142a. Teoretycznie dyrektor m\u00f3g\u0142 mi zabra\u0107 miesi\u0119cznie ok. 500 z\u0142. Zadzia\u0142ali na moj\u0105 niekorzy\u015b\u0107. Jak to funkcjonuje? W zak\u0142adzie opieki zdrowotnej dzia\u0142a kilka zwi\u0105zk\u00f3w zawodowych. Na wprowadzenie zmian w regulaminie wynagradzania musz\u0105 si\u0119 zgodzi\u0107 wszystkie zwi\u0105zki zawodowe opr\u00f3cz zainteresowanego. Wiadomo, \u017ce my\u015bmy si\u0119 nie zgodzili, ale opr\u00f3cz nas musia\u0142 nie zgodzi\u0107 si\u0119 jeszcze jeden zwi\u0105zek. Wtedy nas popar\u0142y piel\u0119gniarki. Nie zgodzi\u0142y si\u0119 i dyrektor nie m\u00f3g\u0142 tego zrobi\u0107. Nie zabra\u0142 nam wtedy tych dodatk\u00f3w. \n\nPO by\u0142o alternatyw\u0105 dla autorytarnych zap\u0119d\u00f3w PISu, kt\u00f3rego nie mog\u0119 znie\u015b\u0107. Ta ca\u0142a retoryka wydaje mi si\u0119 silnie postkomunistyczna. Jestem centrolewicowy. Obecnie nie przygl\u0105da\u0142em si\u0119 partiom lewicowym. Mamy co? Wiosn\u0119, SLD i Razem, Zieloni. Najbli\u017cej i najrozs\u0105dniej jest chyba Razem. Przy czym nie ma si\u0142y przebicia. Chyba na zbyt ma\u0142\u0105 skal\u0119 dzia\u0142aj\u0105. M\u00f3j g\u0142os w wyborach przy obecnych r\u00f3\u017cnicach procentowych nic nie zmieni. Samo poczucie g\u0142osowania na niszow\u0105 parti\u0119, nie utwierdza mnie w tym przekonaniu, \u017ce zmieni cokolwiek moja decyzja lub jej brak.\n\nKa\u017cda zmiana w kraju, je\u015bli ma nast\u0105pi\u0107, musi zacz\u0105\u0107 si\u0119 od jednostki. Stary \u017byd kiedy\u015b powiedzia\u0142: je\u015bli chcesz zmieni\u0107 \u015bwiat, zacznij od siebie. Nie mo\u017cna wymaga\u0107 od kogo\u015b, jak si\u0119 nie wymaga od siebie. Dop\u00f3ki pewne pokolenie nie wymrze, to nic si\u0119 nie zmieni. Na przyk\u0142ad g\u0142\u0119boko zakorzeniony antysemityzm w naszym kraju \u2013 chcia\u0142bym, \u017ceby go nie by\u0142o. W\u015br\u00f3d swoich znajomych ju\u017c nie obserwuj\u0119 tego. Jest inne podej\u015bcie, bardziej ludzkie, nieszufladkuj\u0105ce, otwarte. Ka\u017cdy prawicowy ruch mo\u017ce stanowi\u0107 zagro\u017cenie, dlatego trzeba to monitorowa\u0107. Chocia\u017c z drugiej strony ka\u017cdy ma prawo mie\u0107 takie pogl\u0105dy, jakie ma, ale nie mo\u017ce zabrania\u0107 nikomu mie\u0107 pogl\u0105d\u00f3w zgo\u0142a odmiennych. Mentalno\u015b\u0107 ludzka ma si\u0119 zmieni\u0107. \n\nSam nie jestem wierz\u0105cy chyba ju\u017c. Wystarczy\u0142oby, \u017ceby ludzie, kt\u00f3rzy deklaruj\u0105 si\u0119 jako \u017carliwi katolicy, zacz\u0119li wciela\u0107 w \u017cycie pogl\u0105dy, przekonania wynikaj\u0105ce z ich wiary, a tu jest zupe\u0142nie inaczej. Dla mnie wa\u017cne s\u0105: rodzina, orientacja na drugiego cz\u0142owieka i jego potrzeby, chyba st\u0105d zami\u0142owanie do pracy. \u017byj i daj \u017cy\u0107 innym po prostu. Religia nie pe\u0142ni roli w moim \u017cyciu. \u017bona mia\u0142a si\u0119 zaj\u0105\u0107 wychowaniem, w wierze ale chyba jej to nie wychodzi. Spotykamy si\u0119 przy \u015bwi\u0105tecznym stole i przyjmujemy ksi\u0119dza po kol\u0119dzie, chocia\u017c nie z mojej inicjatywy. Nie chodz\u0119 do ko\u015bcio\u0142a, chocia\u017c dzieciakom si\u0119 zdarza, coraz rzadziej, co wynika z mojej postawy. To wynika z nastawienia negatywnego do ko\u015bcio\u0142a. By\u0142bym ignorantem, gdybym twierdzi\u0142, \u017ce nic nie ma ponad nami. Nie umiem tego oceni\u0107, ale nie wierz\u0119 w ludzi tworz\u0105cych ten system i ca\u0142\u0105 hierarchi\u0119. Wszystko przeszkadza mi w ko\u015bciele: hierarchiczno\u015b\u0107, wyzyskiwanie, orientacja na pieni\u0105dz, pedofilskie skandale, wszystko co sprawia, \u017ce ludzie odwracaj\u0105 si\u0119 od ko\u015bcio\u0142a. Jest ogromny zwi\u0105zek ko\u015bcio\u0142a z polityk\u0105. Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 na pewno zapewnia wsparcie politykom. Nie wiem czy w drug\u0105 stron\u0119. Jest zwi\u0105zany z PISem. Jestem za rozdzia\u0142em pa\u0144stwa od ko\u015bcio\u0142a, ale nie chc\u0119, \u017ceby by\u0142a zepchni\u0119ta na margines, a ludzie wierz\u0105cy b\u0119d\u0105 si\u0119 tak czuli, a tego bym nie chcia\u0142. Niech ka\u017cdy ma prawo wyboru. Moje dzieci chodz\u0105 na religi\u0119. Jestem za zr\u00f3wnaniem zwi\u0105zk\u00f3w wyznaniowych i ko\u015bcio\u0142\u00f3w. Tylko to jest nie do zrobienia, bo my jeste\u015bmy narodem katolickim jakby nie patrze\u0107. Z tego co si\u0119 orientuj\u0119 ksi\u0119\u017ca dostaj\u0105 emerytur\u0119 od pa\u0144stwa, a tak by\u0107 nie powinno. Kto kontroluje ich dochody tak naprawd\u0119? To s\u0105 takie instytucje w\u0142a\u015bnie: ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142, PZPN, chyba nikt nie jest w stanie skontrolowa\u0107 ich finans\u00f3w. \n\nNie mam problem\u00f3w, z kt\u00f3rymi nie da\u0142bym sobie rady. Mam marzenia: chcia\u0142bym mie\u0107 sw\u00f3j dom, uprawiam sport teraz, jest dobrze. Jest to do zrobienia, to kwestia czasu, decyzja o sprzeda\u017cy mieszkania, wi\u0119cej pracy i kredyt. Mamy teraz kredyt na mieszkanie. Sp\u0142acili\u015bmy go w du\u017cej cz\u0119\u015bci. Nie jest mo\u017cliwe, \u017ceby\u015bmy kupili dom na rynku wt\u00f3rnym bez kredytu. My\u015bl\u0119, \u017ce mamy zdolno\u015b\u0107 kredytow\u0105, ale nie mamy wk\u0142adu w\u0142asnego na razie. \n\nNie mam chyba obecnie \u017cadnych autorytet\u00f3w. Sam dla siebie jestem autorytetem.

In my opinion this is the real value (and role) of social networks that we must create.</span></span></font></font></font>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<font color=\"#333333\"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\"><span><span>Yep, I have more material about Every1Tutor, I don't know where to load it in the platform.

What are you working on and why are you on the Internet Days?**\n\nI've been working with the internet, really, from when it started. Saw Clinton and Bildt when they sent emails in 1993. Mosaic, which the browser was called. Been a consultant in informatics. Had a lot of time because I lived in a different city than I wanted.\n\nWas in Japan and monitored the IT and technology area for Sweden's technical attach\u00e9. Worked on public procurement. Ended up on Sweden's radio and was acting chief of IT architecture. I'm now at the Royal Academy of Sciences, responsible for impact projects for the development of society. There have been several threads, but IT-related from when the internet got started in its modern form. This is the third year in a row I'm here. Good opportunity to listen to people and see where the development is going.\n\nWe at IVA are launching new projects that are about digitization for welfare. Have listened to the tracks with the public sector and AI. get to know the people, hear problem descriptions and where there are gaps in the discussion. Our recommendations are often policy-making.\n\n**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**\n\nNow, just now. I'm always both hopeful and scared. Mostly hopeful. Am very fascinated about the future, and enjoy watching movies and reading books. Now it's about Ai and where to go. 20 years ago it was about the web and what opportunities it could bring. There we are now.\n\nI was on SVT's Report tomorrow when I returned from Japan in 2000. Eva Hamilton was a reporter. It was about the commercials, how they would become when we had the colorful mobile phones. \"It'll be expensive,\" she said. That's how the conversation ended. It is moving forward with rapid steps. It is at the beginning of its development, really. There is much left to do. Very exciting. If you try and contribute with common sense and in a wise way, you might help make it more hopeful.\n\nThe discussion last year and a lot today about our integrity and the data, that is certainly needed for AI and it to work, but it must be made available for that benefit while being protected so that you feel secure in not being exploited. That discussion feels just right. Just listened to a politician. It has to be done just like that, he said. Hopeful, to hear politicians say that. Then came business executives from Microsoft and IBM that could only agree. That was surprising, that is not usually how it sounds. Possibly something will also happen in politics.\n\n**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**\n\nJust received a text message from someone named Vanessa who had a mysterious URL. Wanted to meet\u2026 you don't get that every day, but you hear about people who don't understand that something is bad. So they click on the URL. You see the closest circle of relatives and friends. It is a pity that there are people who do not have scruples but try to exploit people in that way.\n\nFuture technologies. artificial intelligence, in the way Max Tegmark describes in his book Life 3.0. If it goes in that direction, we succeed in creating general AI and it comes out without control, without setting rules and principles. It's a horror scenario. Even if we do not get that far, evil forces, criminals and rogue states use powerful technology to build weapons or make terrorist attacks or kill people. It's not hard to come up with those scenarios. Unfortunately, there are forces that want to go there. Also cyber intrusion that you shut down countries' infrastructure, just because you can. Such things are of course scary and unpleasant.\n\nRegarding IVA and AI, it's getting started a little. IVA has not been so focused on IT-related issues. Attempts have been made and now we hope we have started again with \"digitization for increased competitiveness\". In addition to seeing what we can do for welfare, we look at cyber security. The Armed Forces are happy to seek cooperation with the Swedish power grid and the energy sector, who are well aware of the threats and techniques and measures that would be needed. There have been attacks in Ukraine and other palces. Vinnova and others who understand the problem and make investments. At KTH, there are researchers working on it. Many people who want to meet. IVA is the player that is the independent meeting place for these types of meetings and discussions.", "created_at": "2019-11-26 13:53:50.367836", "updated_at": "2019-11-26 13:53:50.367836", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 801, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 26.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10714, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 3351, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Welcome to Edgeryders</b>\n\nHi @yinksy, nice to meet you!\n\nFundraising for the event is already happening, but we can't make any promises.

It started out that way but it was clear even then that the young were canaries in the coalmine- the precarisation of growing sections of populations at large. So we took an open approach asking how people, anyone who wanted to participate, were coping with life. How people were trying to make a living, managing our learning, trying to build healthy relationships with others and with ourselves and.... practical resilience. The diversity of participation lead to a number of things coming out of this including an experimental initiative in Italy called unMonastery. The diversity I think was due to the zoomed out perspective we took, starting from topics and challenges that matter to everyone.

The descriptions you requested are being developed behind the click \u2026\n\nI think this would be a really good first R&D project for The Reef's research facility, because:\n\n* **Major benefits!** Building operation is 28% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions ([source](https://architecture2030.org/buildings_problem_why/)), and the major part of that is space heating. So there is the potential for high impact some time into the future. (I'll find better numbers and sources \u2026)\n\n* **Interesting for everyone.** It's suitable for a mixed community as both a R&D team and a testing ground. Because to create heated clothing and small spaces that are enjoyable and truly better and even more comfortable than our current stuff, it needs both tech ideas, social interaction design (the norms developing around its use), artistic input, handicrafts work and attention to physical comfort and health. It also needs attention to the physical differences between men and women, starting from the volume-to-surface ratio differences, which in turn will influence the thermal lag time (the time somebody is comfortable in a cool environment without heating). So in total, this is a very cross-interest and cross-gender research activity: there'll be something interesting for everyone.\n\n* **An unclaimed area that can be ours.** This set of ideas is so far outside the mainstream of current industrial products that we'll have quite some years to develop this undisturbed before businesses etc. start picking up on these ideas. This is unlike in other areas, where our R&D contributions would stay largely invisible because there is so much competition already.\n\n**Edit:** Decided to split the idea into two, added some descriptions to both in the linked document.

As a result, we strive to produce cars, phones, and financial derivatives. But we don&rsquo;t strive to ensure biodiversity, clean air, and social inclusion. Contemporary economics has produced a way of thinking underwriting the above mentioned issues. From being reduced to a sad, uninspiring numbers game \u2014 1% deficit less here, 1% growth there \u2014 it has lost the blue-sky radicality of Marx and Keynes, and the audacity of Fourier, Owens and Olivetti. This has lead us a downward, rather than a forward, path.\n\n**\u201cThe climate crisis is not there because people are evil or because people are stupid and don't really see what's happening. The climate crisis is here because it is profitable.\u201d** Alberto Cottica, Co-founder and research director at Edgeryders, explains that the current system of economic thinking is broken, and both economists in high places of power, as well as academics, haven&rsquo;t been able to make a difference:\n\n**&ldquo;Economics, as we know it currently, has pivoted from being a place where you could imagine, to a discipline which re-enforces and improves itself in a single model,&rdquo;** explains @alberto.\n\nWhen economists started gaining power \u2014 from becoming ministers to serving in senior posts in international institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 they had to underwrite the system already in place in exchange for the power.\n\n\n&ldquo;Since I started my studies more than 30 years ago, we are left with a very narrow range of economic systems that current economics can expose. It's become impossible to think about any alternative, any radical alternative organization of our economies,&rdquo; says Alberto.\n\n**In academia, a similar problem has arisen.** Researchers looking to make a career in academia need to be published in well-known journals, discussing topics already part of the academic debate. Economics doesn't allow you to stray too far, Alberto explains. &ldquo;It's a kind of risky proposition to shift the academic debate and it doesn't make sense for a researcher striving to get tenure and to get a job to do that.&rdquo;\n\nAlberto decided to study economics thirty years ago, because he had the desire to change society and influence policy. &ldquo;I became an economist because I wanted to understand what was wrong in society and improve the way we all live together,&rdquo; says Alberto.\n\nIt&rsquo;s the same reason why he started the well-known and politically engaged Italian rock band, [Modena City Ramblers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modena_City_Ramblers): he wanted to contribute to a national debate, influence how people think and what they are trying to achieve together. It&rsquo;s for that same reason he decided to co-found Edgeryders, to try and make a difference in the world, running a post-capitalist enterprise working with a community of thinkers, economists, activists, doers, and makers.\n\n**When economists and academics can&rsquo;t dream up a new, plausible, economic system to help us divert the crisis we are in, who can?**\n\nAlberto has been looking for a solution to our economic systems for the past three decades, disillusioned by the inability of current economic systems to improve the lives of people. How can we find new approaches to rebuilding our societies, combining how humans interact, live collectively and make collective choices about their lives?\n\nIt is clear we are at a crossroads of change. From the Extinction Rebellion movement, to Facebook&rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg being grilled in the US congress for the platforms gross violations of people&rsquo;s privacy, to it&rsquo;s unstoppable spreading of disinformation.  \n\n**Right now, together with the Edgeryders community, he&rsquo;s set his eyes on science fiction as a tool to radically rethink our economy.**\n\n&ldquo;Science fiction is an intellectual exercise. A good SF author turns the fabric of society in his or her head, with a scientist&rsquo;s curiosity. What happens if I pull a specific thread? For example: what if progress in medicine and biotech made extreme longevity possible, but only for the very rich?&rdquo; explains Alberto, adding that science fiction authors have been creating fictional economies that aren&rsquo;t real, but plausible \u2014 doing exactly what economics itself is no longer doing.\n\n&ldquo;Science fiction was a very early interest for me,&rdquo; says Alberto, explaining he got into it when he was in primary school. &ldquo;I really liked the idea of imagining alternative universes.&rdquo; And that is why he&rsquo;s now venturing into combining science fiction and economics. Especially the world-building part of science fiction novels is what could provide an alternative: what would happen if robots could think? What would happen if there were a bunch of miners mining asteroids for precious metals? What would happen if we could travel through time?\n\n**A few science fiction authors have created fictional economies, which are completely different from the one we have, while also being based on economic thinking.** Some of them will be viable, Alberto says, some of them won&rsquo;t, and some of them wouldn&rsquo;t even be desirable (like the capitalism-gone-rogue worlds of many cyberpunk novels).\n\n**As a prime example Alberto mentions Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s books Makers and Walkaway, reflections on well-known economic problems.** \n\nIn the first, Doctorow describes a world in which people hack hardware, business-models, to discover ways of staying alive and happy even when the economy is failing them.\n\n**In Walkaway, the author dives into a world of non-work, ruined by human-created climate change and pollution, where people are under surveillance and ruled over by a mega-rich elite.** The main characters decide that they have nothing to lose by turning their backs and walking away from the everyday world or &quot;default reality.&quot; Through open source technologies such as 3D printing \u2013 and especially the ability to use these to fabricate even better fabricators \u2013 and with machines that can search for and reprocess waste or discarded materials, they no longer have need of Default for the basic essentials of life, such as food, clothing and shelter. This gives rise to a &ldquo;dual economy&rdquo;, with two co-existing economic systems: Default runs capitalism, Walkaway runs a sort of commons-based peer production.\n\n**Doctorow is one of the speakers at the first Sci-Fi Economics Lab event Edgeryders is organizing in Brussels on November 11th.** The event will consist of four parts: a double keynote lecture \u2013 which will also be live-streamed; Reclaiming Utopia, a workshop where you can learn how to mobilize yourself for a more humane, fairer, greener economy, in collaboration with Extinction Rebellion; a party, because &ldquo;if we can&rsquo;t dance, we don&rsquo;t want your alt-economy;&rdquo; and a brainstorming session to create abstracts for contributions to economic theory and economic policy underpinning fictional economies.\n\n**&ldquo;Basically, what we are trying to do from a societal point of view, is to build a range of alternatives that society could choose from. Maybe we want to keep the present system, but we shouldn't keep the economic system because we can&rsquo;t think of a better one,&rdquo; says Alberto**\n\n\n## The event is taking place in Brussels, as it&rsquo;s the capital of Europe where &ldquo;we can multiply the impact of a shift in thinking&rdquo;\n\n**The keynote lecture is going to be chaired by Kirsten Dunlop, CEO of EIT Climate-KIC \u2014 the European Union's largest agency, funding climate innovation.** &ldquo;We want to generate a fresh kind of thinking, which we can share with the public, the public authorities, the public powers.&rdquo; Alberto adds. &ldquo;**If we can show to economists and to science fiction authors the interest of the public powers, then we can incentivize them to do more work in this area**.&rdquo;\n\n## But we cannot do it without your support!\n\nHelp us with our crowdfunding campaign, choose your pledge and  **receive the ticket plus goodies for the Brussels 11th event:** \n\nhttp://bit.ly/ScifiEconLab\n\n## You cannot make it to Brussels?\n\nYou can still support the project, and **gain access to the live streaming of the event!** \n\nWe also commit to document the brainstorming session to write Sci-FI Economics papers, and share the documentation with you. \n\nAnd finally, we are Edgeryders: working together remotely is what we do. By supporting us, you gain a seat at the table of how we develop the Science Fiction Economics Lab into 2020 and beyond.**\n\nSee you on November 11!", "created_at": "2019-10-28 16:48:20.353842", "updated_at": "2020-05-08 11:26:12.285852", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1462, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 2605.0, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 4096, 2330, 3704, 8, 5449], "is_private": false}, {"id": 34309, "user_id": 3791, "topic_id": 6063, "post_number": 6, "raw": "Hello @iffat_e_faria.

Quotes are not verbatim but summarize what was said. If you feel something is mis-represented, please tell us in a comment or with the \"Flag \u2192 Something Else\" feature and a mod will fix it. \u2013 @anu]_\n\nIn 2018 a new law is going to enter in function in eu , regulate data \n\nThe issue is the 1st time focuses Europe accountability and responsibility. \nTiy would be clear to justify why this data is needed for your service. \n\nA person that will be independent from the board, and with his/her team is responsible for your data. \n\nSmall organisations will have it harder to comply with the law, because it does not make sense for them to have an independent manager of privacy.\n\nEg. now that the WAP2 protocol has been exposed as vulnerable, as a small business, you would need to get a new router right away, not wait for an update from the seller. Otherwise, by a literal interpretation of the law, you would be liable if data is leaked through a hack. But this does not make sense, there will need to be precedents in court, that interpret the law considering the scale of the organisation and the scale of the vulnerability or breach.\n\nThe law applies to everyone that is active in the European region, even those based outside of it. The US does not have a data protection responsible.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for the government to do open date, because it is always possible to make links by cross referencing with other data sets. Basically, they would need to anonymize it to the extent that it is not usable.\n\nThe telecom companies think about the data they collect as \u2018their data\u2019. According to the law, however, it is your data. \n\nTelecom companies for example thinks about the traffic data as its own data on how they work, although by law they are personal data. \n\n**How to enforce?**\n\nAbout privacy, it seems like a fragile system, if only one goes down, then you are also at risk. Everyone needs to be watertight for it to be work.\nThis could be done by the new law you must identify why you are collecting your data. \n\n\n**Is there a way to broker in a market way the data?**\nExchange consent to use your data in return for a payment (phone, $5, ...).\n\n* More of a question of exploiting vulnerability than a matter of exchange. \nThe example of phones for homeless people in USA is mainly a simple exchange just names in order to make sure everyone got only one phone. \n\nIn practical ( alberto), not having emails in spreadsheets for example, unless you tell people and enable a methodology for them to delete, as this is going to be pricy, [ encrypt or if you don\u2019t do it if you don\u2019t need it ]\n\n**How to check where data is going?**\n**As a small person blogger, where do you go for help in safing up your data handling ?**\n\n1st, question, the companies should appoint someone to do so according to the new law.\n\nAs a blogger, then this should be done by the company that runs the blogs, ( wordpress or so ) unless you are self hosted, then you have to do it yourself. You would have to monitor your infrastructure and this is not easy, but I presume if taken to court, a judge would rule you have no responsibility, but if you are running a platform with 200 contributor\nMay be it is about what data you are collecting\nYou are responsible equally on personal data, whatever it is.\nThen if you have no obligation in collecting actual names and emails then you have no sensitive data.\n\n**If a company is taken to court for not giving someone his data?, can they go for many people ?**\nDepends on the percentage, if the whole europe brought Fb to court , that's something but if one person, then its one person. \n\nRecenlty there was an experiment in  us uni, over 90% of students express extreme importance of data security ...and outside 100% gave all there data to get a free pizza at a stand just outside.\n\n**On the IOT, barcelona ?**\n\nThe problem of IOT , like environmental sensors that are inside homes, \n_[..................]_\n\nRise of citizen science projects and DIY data connection \nIf they work with Europeans according to law they should abeid by the new law, if applicable. \n\nCitizen science has an advantage, as they are communities not companies. As you will find lots of experts in between communities. \n\n_[...........]_\nEven if the community has their own rules and ethics, but once they publish something then they become visible and must justify the process. \n\n\n##Trust and credibility\n* **For audience \u201cHow do you a trust an organization ( or not ) ?**\n* **What\u2019s your criteria ?**\n* **Do i know the people , can I talk to them?**\n* **If a friend vouches for them, Where is the money come from or who owns them?**\n\nIn data ethics , 1st\nThe commitment of doing no harm.\nThis can not be trusted\n\n**But if they are enforced ?**\n\nThe issue of they are committed and must do this. \nWhen you are running an activity making sure to be transparent that you commit to protect the data from risks that can be now or in the future, in a transparent process. \n\nSo GDRP is extremely paralyzing in one way, but there is a rational behind it, and transparency and being open is a part from a plausible plan.\n\nFROM now till May, what is being done?\nWe are now already in a grey zone, the text was published last year. \nCurrently, lawyers are making some consultancies.\nBrussels for example data and groups come together every 2 weeks to discuss , including data experts, lawyers and so, and possibly in every other place.\n\n**What about the open source software and platform, like discourse, but what happens in these situation?**\n\nOpen Source in principle says it comes as it is, unfortunately it becomes the problem of who\u2019s running it. Otherwise you will have to do it yourself. \n\n\n\n**How did this law came about to be ?** ( John Coate as this didn\u2019t pull up in the US ) \n\n \nValue chain map as a better alternative for SWOT.", "created_at": "2017-10-26 23:14:06.363821", "updated_at": "2017-10-31 23:38:49.099984", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1068, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 21.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42196, "user_id": 3311, "topic_id": 8061, "post_number": 18, "raw": "@ramykim I'd love to but have to gauge my funds at the mid-end March 2018 to see if this is a possibility. @thomasmboa Do you have any idea of the costs associated with participating?

Which makes sense, especially if you add pollution potential of coal (I'm from Krakow originally, one of the towns most polluted by low emission). \n\nHaving said that, I must add that my original point was about stupidity of shutting down nuclear power plants and replacing them by gas (best case) or coal (worst case), where there's clear increase in emissions.  You can see this effect clearly on this graph which shows effect of temporary switching off 3 nuclear blocks in Cruas, France last week ([real-time data](https://www.rte-france.com/fr/eco2mix/eco2mix-co2)) which **immediately doubled CO2 emissions**:\n\n![France%20switching%20off%20nuclear%20blocks%202019|412x690](upload://wgzyNuL6QxnDx6STkOcCb8WgJnp.jpeg) \n\nSecond issue is the gas source - Russia is an authoritarian country that has long history of [weaponizing hydrocarbon supplies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia\u2013European_Union_relations#Energy) for political purposes.", "created_at": "2019-11-21 01:07:16.456573", "updated_at": "2019-11-21 01:31:06.892795", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 337, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [64798], "is_reply_to": [64798], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 70561, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 12720, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Where does this glossary come from?
