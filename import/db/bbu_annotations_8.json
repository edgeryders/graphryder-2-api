If there were stains, Miss Mary had to first apply powered bleach or detergent and allow the shirt to soak in lukewarm water for a brief period of time. After a few minutes, she would begin to massage it against itself. In bygone days, housewives would use a scrubbing board, but this would often damage the shirt if done too aggressively. Nowadays, we have washing machines so Miss Mary could afford to do only light scrubbing with her hands. Once that was complete, the shirt will be thrown against the air, allowing it to throw off any excess liquid. Miss Mary would then inspect it one more time to make sure the whole shirt has taken in the cleansing powder and any visible stains had at least been awakened.
