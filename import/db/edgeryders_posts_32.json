It starts from not counting on any government support, because government is usually captive to the influence of the lobbyists with the piles of cash. And, I also think it's useless to appeal to the conscience or foresight of consumers: often, they go for the cheapest food, produced by Big Ag companies, because they don't have money for more. Neoliberal markets are pushing consumers hard everywhere, and foresight for them would rather mean to save up for a rainy day than to support a local food system with uncertain outcomes.\n\nInstead, what I propose is a solution that, from the start, benefits everyone and achieves a localized food sovereignty. I assume many farmers on small farms in Serbia are already part-time farmers as they have to supplement their income from other sources. In such a situation, one could try to persuade a group of ~20 such farmers to become a food-sovereign unit. Each of them would specialize somewhat, which makes production more time-efficient compared to a case where everyone grows everything they need for themselves. And then they use a system of circular bartering to help each other out. Later, handicrafts people etc. can also join such a system, forming a local economy that is sheltered from any competition with Big Ag.\n\nI have written about the economic properties of such a circular barter system at length (you can [search for \"PayCoupons\"](https://edgeryders.eu/search?q=PayCoupons) here on the platform, which is the name of the prototype circular barter system we created). It's basically a deadlock resolver: people who were outcompeted by big ag companies and sitting at home idle can just as well re-start their small-scale farming and trade with others who were outcompeted in the same way. Compared to not being able to supply for oneself in a big ag dominated economy, a \"less efficient\" local economy of small farms is certainly preferable, as everyone will be able to make their own living.", "created_at": "2020-10-23 12:00:05.752559", "updated_at": "2020-10-23 12:00:05.752559", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 388, "wiki": false, "reads": 25, "score": 95.0, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 2915, 3206, 3, 1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32447, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 5720, "post_number": 32, "raw": "<b>Couldn't keep up \u2026 will try again</b>\n\n@Alberto It is on my list but I did not get to it so far.

That is, way before the fall of the Northern border front where Northern European tribes where always making trouble. A centrally controlled Empire that could not fund its armies adequately anymore was simply not something possible or worth it to keep up. Of course the Emperors did not do this, and we know the results. Using a backstory like this, The Reef spaces could be easily framed as seeds for quasi-sovereign organizations in a networked world of the future after the fall of nation states. Just be clear that the spaces and its members respect the laws of the powers that be (to not get prosecuted like the German \"Reichsb\u00fcger\" movement now). And then you're free to build up your sovereignty over time by minimizing influence of governments on the space and on its members, and at the same time minimizing all dependency on these governments. If nation states really fall, we'll not have to start from scratch. If they don't fall, it nonetheless makes fro a great story preparing for this, which will be attractive during troubled political timess :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-21 19:13:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:32.810225", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 290, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26644], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86413, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 192, "raw": "![Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2020-11-08 a\u0300 00.31.18|655x690](upload://1Gjvk9NWOK2MRB10KkPQlQmlhWG.png)", "created_at": "2020-11-07 23:31:49.451767", "updated_at": "2020-11-07 23:31:49.451767", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 47.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [86408], "is_liked_by": [2915, 1877], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87450, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14913, "post_number": 4, "raw": "ping @nadia, @leonie, here the event post for the next AMA. @LauraRoddy, could you quickly proofread?", "created_at": "2020-11-23 17:16:55.050803", "updated_at": "2020-11-23 17:16:55.050803", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 21.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 73179, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 13060, "post_number": 2, "raw": "Also, I just love this comment by Max:\n\n> Whatever happens I feel confident the ever-mutating hydra of chaos magic that is the borderland will float along the path of most resistance to allocate randomness in the least pareto efficient way.

The issue is that whereas everybody is more or less allowed to provide goods and services, the Monetary System is a monopoly that even stands above governments. Only about 2% of the money \"produced\" or created is actually coined by governments (physical money), the rest by commercial banks (digital) by means of what is known as Fractional Reserve Banking. Besides the actual monetary system's inner workings, the key issue here is that only a handful are allowed to \"produce\" money, and as it is nearly the only way to trade goods and services. it becomes the \"bottle neck\" of any economy. Worse. only about 2% of the monetary transfers deal with productive economy, the majority being FOREX, which means, currencies being traded to earn money from ... yes, trading money.\nStill, we should be able to differentiate money, as a human discovery (or innovation), from the official monetary system, which makes money a absolute need for everyone wanting to engage in economic exchanges.\n\n> If you look at Amazon, this is a company that comes as close as I can think of at this time to what I think you are suggesting.\n\nindeed, and to a degree, you are right. Many of the books are printed \"on demand\" and where not physically available before the order was made. However, most of the other goods do not fall into this category. There are people and companies that produce those goods (creating a supply) before the demand is there.\n\nHowever, in a proper \"Real Economy\" production happens \"after\" the need has been presented. So production is there to fulfill real needs. In our current Market Economy, there's a lot of waste and inefficiency in the supply side of production, because a lot of the goods and even services exist in excess of demand. Yes, this drives prices down, but also up when there is scarcity, which is another symptom of an inefficient system.\n\n> Now, of course the majority of production in the economy is not end products, but labor \u2013 capital (in the economic sense of machinery and buildings used for production) is second. So\u2026 if you want to be a kind of Mega-Amazon, you start putting the people who are skilled in producing \u201cx\u201d product in a position of making as much of it as the market demands \u2013 no more, no less \u2013 and of course at the same level of quality (and price) as customers want. This is what we call \u201cvertical integration\u201d\u2026 ;-). Utopia or dystopia? You pick. But it is just smart use of big data on a gigantic scale.\n\nI have given conferences on the subject of Real Economy vs. Market Economy, and have some material in ppt and some writings that I could share with you, if you are interested. An integrated system of economy is dependant on the \"limited resources\" and the ecological sustainability of its practices. One of the problems of our current Monetary Market Economy is that the factor \"monetary system\" is based on something called the 'growth imperative\" that goes against the \"natural growth\" of our ecology. In fact, in natural growth, systems tend to evolve towards efficiency and balance, rather than inefficiency and imbalance. So what we would need to do, among other things, is to learn via Biomimicry how it is that natural systems as complex as our planet manage to stay in balance, not only via homeostasis, but by means of something less known but just as important called homeorhesis.\n( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeorhesis#:~:text=Homeorhesis%2C%20derived%20from%20the%20Greek,state%2C%20which%20is%20termed%20homeostasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeorhesis#:~:text=Homeorhesis%2C%20derived%20from%20the%20Greek,state%2C%20which%20is%20termed%20homeostasis). )\n\nI believe that \"inventing\" a world through the lens of SF can be very helpful to envision solutions to current and future problems before they actually arise.\n\nAll the best,\n\nLeonardo", "created_at": "2020-11-29 20:28:38", "updated_at": "2020-11-29 20:29:09.008015", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 733, "wiki": false, "reads": 30, "score": 40.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [87761], "is_liked_by": [4, 6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86578, "user_id": 1877, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 198, "raw": "[quote=\"johncoate, post:197, topic:13292\"]\n... there would be an orderly transition to a second Trump term.\n[/quote]\n\nSee, this is why I can't get over what has just happened: **Artsakh/Karabakh is not a regional issue, it's a global trend**.\n\n*We* are, collectively, **watching democracy slipping, devoided of it's ability to make a difference, any difference, to stand for what we think are humanist values**.

True, every researcher develops their own taxonomy, but all that semantic tagging is valuable data that just begs for reuse \u2013 possible by relating the individual taxonomies to some broader concepts.\n\nThis leads to integration with the semantic web as these broader concepts are basically terms in existing semantic web vocabularies. But that's of use just for other software (other websites being able to query ours about stuff). A double use for non-researchers could however be a visual navigation tool, similar to the one of Metamaps.

I mean \"Real Economy\" not Teal ...\n\nI am in a situation right now where my wife got an operation, so I've been dealing with that (northing serious, but have had to focus on that), but basically the situation is that Market Economy is based on the usual Supply vs Demand (as they all say), and this is the \"structural fallacy\" because the third side of the triangulation is \"Money.\" In a Market Economy that uses Money to close economic transactions, what everybody is after, at the end of the day, is to \"get to the money\" because of the monopoly that exists on who has the right to \"make\" the currency used in transactions. And hardly anybody knows what money is, how it works, who controls it, etc.\n\nAs those who wish to access money create a \"Supply\" of goods and services, their real intention is to find the \"Demand\" needed to close the transactions so they can acquire the above mentioned Money. Such a system cannot be efficient.\n\nReal Economy is focused through an information system to find out what the Need is before production. So Production is based on Real Needs rather than an abstract Demand. A real economy is Need based, not Supply based.

Sometimes I get the chance to observe closely how a student develops over the course of three years. Altogether, it is much more helpful to NOT setting an equal standards and goals for all students alike, but to see where they (each student, individually, that is) are at the beginning of the first year, and then compare it to the point they have reached at the end of the third year. For me, it is by now clear that this is the only feasible (and fair) way to evaluate a student. Within these three years, you see a lot of \"latency\" time, where, on the surface, nothing much is happening, and it doesn't make sense to rush people in these latency phases. Comments like \"You should know this by now\" are not helpful, because they bring upon a feeling of frustration in the student, and the whole \"undercurrent\" learning process could be in peril.\n\nObviously, these ways of teaching are not always in line with the official agendas of the institute or the ministry of education. Which makes me wonder why education has all of a sudden become such a competitive thing. It's almost like putting out the decree that a pregnancy from now on has to be done with in only 5 months.\n\nWhile it is true that you have to do the hours to learn anything, it doesn't mean that you will see the fruits of these processes occur at a pre-calculated point of time.\n\nI am a supporter of the slow movement,\n\nhttp://www.slowmovement.com/slow_schools.php\n\nnot because I want everything to be slow, but because I know that latency and incubation phases are individual and relative to many other factors, and these phases, are, by default, slow.\n\nWhat you call, Noemi, the schedule of command, is actually a tendency to apply the logic and the pace of machines to human beings, the 24/7 full speed ultimate efficiency kind of thinking that leads to the burned out wreckage we can see all around us.\n\nThis is a discussion and a challenge that I'm very interested in, and I hope I can contribute with some of my thoughts/ideas.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-20 15:36:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:22.251058", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 407, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28333, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4393, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>An update</b>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Just received an email from<a href=\"http://capeemaroc.org/\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0CAPEE</a>\u00a0-\u00a0an interface between the members of the Collective and public institutions, businesses, donors, organized groups of civil society, media and other partners.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">CAPEE aims to help improve methods and conditions for learning; to raise awareness and mobilize the entrepreneurial network for involvement in education and entrepreneurship and to inform and promote the commitments of the Association and the various actions.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Asmaa Benyahia of CAPEE says their chairman would be happy to meet Alberto at 10AM on June 09 in Casablanca.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Please, let me know if I can go ahead and confirm this meeting.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Cheers</div>", "created_at": "2015-05-29 15:17:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:36.176154", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 332, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41716, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8068, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/da0ce7c12ca7dc17c2e14be92cf7fae39b3ca1d6.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"457\">\n*Our Jedi Knight-like djellabas came in handy in the cold of Moroccan winter. Photo credits: Matteo Uguzzoni*\n\nAs I moved in the OpenVillage House in Sidi Kaouki, in late January, I realized it was not the easiest place to live. Morocco was (and still is) undergoing a phase of exceptionally cold weather. We get plenty of sunshine, but it goes down to 6-10\u00b0 during the night, and it's always windy. Still quite good by European standards, but houses here have no heating. Also, the equipment and infrastructure could use more maintenance. In my two weeks in the House, we spent significant time and effort re-organizing the kitchen (everyone), chopping firewood (@matteo_uguzzoni, @AhmedMajdoub, @gregoiremarty and @SyMorin), fixing the bicycles (@matthias), uncluttering drains, and taking the washing machine apart (@johncoate for both). @hazem, housemaster, helped a lot with support and kindness. \n\nI was only the third person to move in. With so much to do, frankly, we were struggling, and not much project work was getting done. Ahmed arrived after a few days, but that did not fundamentally alter the dynamics. But then Gregoire and Simon moved in. When we were six, things shifted. \n\nFood got better. Now people wanted to outdo each other in preparing the best meal. As an Italian, I had a field advantage :wink:; but nobody wanted to be left behind. One evening that I was the main cook, Simon insisted in making dessert, and he ended up with something positively decadent: strawberries glazed in melted chocolate! This was the same effect we noticed in the unMonastery; if you can cook one meal out, say, four, and be served the other three, you try to reciprocate by making an effort when it's your turn to cook. Additionally, both at the unMonastery and here cooking shifts consist of two people, so cooking turns out to be social and fun.\n\nThe cleaning got better, too. People who had not been cooking did not want to be seen as slacking, and so threw themselves at doing the dishes. People who had missed on that got busy sweeping, or cleaning the bathroom. \n\nNone of this was planned, and no one had to say anything. Simon and Gregoire left, but were replaced by John and Matteo. The same dynamics stayed \u2013 and in fact was enhanced, since both John and Matteo are handier than most. Maybe six is a kind of Dunbar number, but a *minimum* number for these dynamics to unlock. Maybe there are other Dunbar-ish numbers, and new things will emerge when, say, there are ten or fourteen people in the House. We'll find out.  \n\nMatthias and I had a very interesting discussion reflecting on this. It went more or less like this:\n\nME: This is great. It's not broken, don't fix it. The informality works fine, and has zero overhead.\n\nMATT: I worry that the less visible house tasks will go unappreciated. It would be more transparent if we maintained a task list [we have one now], told people to expect to spend 1.5 hours per day on house tasks and to go find something to do on the list. \n\nIn a way, this goes back to the old discussion about how introverts and extroverts run things, as introduced by @trythis. Matt has a valid point, and so do I. What do you think? Should we have formalized task lists or does informality work better?", "created_at": "2018-02-10 22:48:44.062992", "updated_at": "2018-02-12 16:07:55.557098", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 587, "wiki": false, "reads": 39, "score": 622.8, "like_count": 15, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3811, 5, 1935, 4257, 3791, 2201, 3875, 4267, 4275, 347, 3362, 4022, 3, 3729, 4101], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41754, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 8068, "post_number": 9, "raw": "A clean house is one level of consideration for one's housemates and left undone makes the whole place unpleasant.  But I agree that just focusing on keeping things clean is a sort of entry level that everyone understands.  Taking on tasks that have longer-term benefits such as Matt describes should accompany standard household chores.  I'm repeating myself but this is where the list is valuable.  And it is very satisfying to do a task that has that longer term value.  That said, I have not cooked dinner here and have certainly enjoyed the meals others have cooked. And there are some good cooks here.  So I think if one is a better cook than I am and I am better at fixing things then that is a good division of labor, though I don't think it should become a rigid set of roles.\n\nI am pretty good at fixing things when there are few tools and materials around.  So, when I see that someone is handling things in the kitchen, I feel a stronger obligation to make my contribution in that other area.  I don't totally depend on the list - I made the shower head work better and that was just something I noticed needed maintenance - but there is a pleasure in checking something off of that list as a problem now solved.\n\nAlso it should be noted, \"who does the work calls the shots\" applies for sure.

I came across <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html\">this post </a>a while ago which brings up a distinction between the so called Manager's schedule and Maker's schedule:\n\n<em>\"The manager's schedule is for bosses. It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you're doing every hour.\n\nMost powerful people are on the manager's schedule. It's the schedule of command. But there's another way of using time that's common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can't write or program well in units of an hour. That's barely enough time to get started.\"</em>\n\nMany of my friends working in corporate environments' are evaluated in the 9 to 5 framework, and leisure time is almost institutionalized, whereas in areas and environments like Edgeryders' (where I do community management) or freelancing more generally, what matters is the focus on getting things done in one's individual time frame. This brings up a lot of questions around hierarchy and values shaping our work culture.. It's a pity the way we use our time is not really a choice for many peers, so what I notice is they often end up constraining their versions of fulfillment and hapiness within the given \"box\".\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-11-20 12:35:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:43.250331", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 294, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 1673], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41735, "user_id": 3811, "topic_id": 8073, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I now have left the Open Village since 6 days. I have been there from sunday 1st Feb to wednesday 4th Feb. In all aspects of the journey, it was a discovery. Here is the story of my 2 days in Dar Nezza, the house of our morrocan Open Village in Sidi Kaouiki.\n\n\n_PART 1_\n\n\n## **BACKGROUND STORY :**\n\n\n* **_initial steps:_**\nI was contacted last year just before winter by @unknown_author  He was trying to build a team around a project, and reached both @SyMorin and I in order to be a part of it. That project was to create a meshnet to host an independent radio in the area of the open village. I slowly but surely took the lead in this project, and we tried our best to keep in on tracks, though it was quite hard because of last minutes changes. This is written [in this post right here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/essaouira-projects-documenting-independant-radio-initial-steps-feb-2018/7863).\n* **_initials ideas:_**\nIf we all discussed the radio project, we also shared secondary options related to our main field of competences. As my main field of action is writing about local scale, and investigating both its related concepts and how they're activated in the parisian area regarding food (vegetables and milk), it appears natural to me that I could also study the fresh food cycles patterns near the Open Village, and see what it's all about. In my mind, I had the plan as option B, knowing that 2 days there would be short, and not knowing it yet that it would be activated in the end... I also had the motivation to document EVERYTHING \n* **_initial team:_**\nIn the discussions we had on the several ER tools, the team was supposed to gather @matthias @unknown_author @SyMorin @hazem and I... I never worked with/via ER before, and I didn't know what to expect. I quickly decided to wait and see once at the location. I was not disappointed, yet I was definitely surprised.\n* **_initial feelings:_**\nHow not be ecstatic about such project? In my mind, and for the first time, I was switching from writing my reflexions on my blog to actually investigating their fields of real \"activation\" somewhere else, with the excitement of the analysis, the ethnographic work, the documenting. I was looking to do what I thought about. To check the patterns, to learn from others, to discuss the topics, and enhance the visions I had about my fields. I was ON FIRE !\n\n## **PLANNING THE TRIP :**\n* **_plans change, insights change too, but the drive?_**\nAs the time was closer and closer to my journey there, the initial plans tangled, switched, twisted. With them, the insights that motivated them changed too. I was discussing both with the team in its full collective intelligence, and also with separated people that went in and out of the main discussion. As I said, I was a newbie, and as a newbie I needed to understand how ER worked, how all of this would eventually work. It wasn\u2019t doubt though. I never doubt anybody nor anything but the timing, because sometime, this little one is a tricky bastard. Both @anique.yael and @hazem answered many of my questions, and the more we discussed things, the more I was into the project, whatever event would eventually make me think that I wouldn't be able to fly over there. But the DRIVE to get there was too deep. It finally cleaned out everything with the help of ER admins of course, and there I was\u2026 In the plane.\n\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e7b4f28d011b354fc8fdb734305f37ecc5e3abbd.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></c></DIV>\n<p>\n<p>\n\n* **_looking for the best way:_**\nAt the last moment, Daily informed us that he missed his plane. And wont be able to reach Essaouira and the house before tuesday night\u2026 @SyMorin  and I were planned to leave the house on Wednesday so, it was short, but both @SyMorin  and I didn\u2019t overthink about that, as we both were in the same taxi, reaching Sidi Kaouiki from Marrakesh.\nIt was a 3 hours ride with Samir, our driver. A drive that obviously has been more a brieffing than anything. Naturally, we both came out with the same purpose, drive and motivation: in the absence of @unknown_author, we would investigate Essaouira and the fresh food cycles, as much as possible in such a limited time. The whole independent radio project was out of our minds. For the best of our trip there I presume. As Sy was telling me that he started digging restaurants in Rabat (Morocco, where he lives since 9 months) that were cooking local products only, I was discussing the concepts around local-scale power. We agreed that working together on that could be awesome. I definitely has been during two days at the house.\n<p>\n<DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fe48f89092649bf01ba8c92b62c654d88a20605d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></DIV>\n<p>\n<p>\n\n* **_finally getting there_**\nAfter quite a long travel (especially for Sy\u2026), we arrived for dinner. Hazem was our first contact there, coming to the gate and opening us. It was a cold, humid kind of night\u2026 The blue door of the house opened and I saw alberto, then Ahmad, then Matt. Everything was so quiet and calm. Diner was already served and we didn\u2019t miss a minute before getting around the table and having our first chat. _On a fait connaissance_, as we say in french. The food was awesomely cooked by @hazem and Ahmad, and we shared our first jokes around that very spicy salad that Ahmad cooked for us. We were a bunch of guys coming from Tunisia, Italia, Germany, Egypt and France, from different cultures, with different backgrounds and experiences : I am a french cheesemonger, former music industry worker with Anthropology and Sociology masters, looking forward to developp more about _local-scale_... I mean, these guys could be ANYTHING! (and they actually are!) Anyways... as our first meal was on, I understood that more than a collective effort to make a bunch of projects, if was more like the gathering of individual projects, in the same room, to maximize the effect of the collective intelligence on each journey. @matthias would work on the coffee sorter, @alberto had his own projects and thesis to write, @hazem was handling the organization of the house and of the Open Village, and so on... At the end of the day, I jumped into bed with the following goals: learning [the ethnographic tool](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ethnography-as-a-collaborative-science-with-open-ethnographer/5871) of ER with @alberto, going to Sidi Kaouiki and Essaouira with @SyMorin , cook a meal for the guys...

The Amish -\u00a0a culture of independance and thrift may be a way to balance community support and individual responsibility. A cost-conscious,\u00a0community-based take on American healthcare may be able to teach the general population a thing or two about dealing with a broken healthcare system. Health care practices vary considerably across Amish communities and from family to family. Many Amish use modern medical services, but others turn to alternative forms of treatment within their community. \u00a0The Amish society accepts responsibility for their own actions and chooses not to depend on services offered by the state and Amish communities opt out of the government-funded insurance. Opposed to commercial insurance and they pride themselves on taking care of their own. To assist one another, they willingly offer donations when a member of their community becomes ill.\u00a0It may not fit in this area, but I thought it was an interesting read a thought I would share. \u00a0\n\n<strong>Excerpt from the article: \u00a0</strong>\n\nPlain communities are highly interested in health education and disease prevention.\u00a0Coming from an ethic of thriftiness, many Plain people distrust the motives of hospital administrators and even doctors themselves. They believe a profit motive can influence courses of treatment. They are also keenly attuned to unnecessary expenditures within the system.\n\n\u201cIn the Amish world, healthcare is seen as a ministry,\u201d says Wengerd, \u201cwhich is exactly what healthcare in the [non-Plain] world used to be.\u201d Remember apprenticeships and house calls?

It starts by breaking down the design, manufacture, distribution, use and end-of-life of a product into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPO_Model\">Input-Process-Output models</a>.\n\nThis software/documentation framework should be a method to collect information about potential uses for particular parts, materials, compounds and so on \u2013 eventually once enough processes are documented you can start to plug the outputs from one process into another.\n\nOn a not-particularly detailed level, let's say that a pineapple processing plant has a process that inputs pineapples, and outputs tinned pineapple, pineapple juice, pineapple skins/husk and pineapple leaves. Perhaps the skins and leaves are currently only used for composting.\n\nA system like IPO Tables should be able to inform the company running the plant that pineapple leaves are being used as an input in another process to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/21/wearable-pineapple-leather-alternative\">manufacture textiles</a>.\n\nMy question for you is whether the Makerfox system of network barter could be plugged into this system in some way \u2013 so that not only can the pineapple company learn that there is a process which uses their waste as an input, but a deal can also be made for the textile company to receive this waste and in turn the pineapple company can receive an input they might require (fertiliser for example, or something much more valuable to them than compost) from elsewhere in the economy.\n\nThoughts?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-20 07:46:00", "updated_at": "2017-09-25 14:41:21.954248", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 444, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 50.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 41784, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 8077, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Yara = wonderful person.

Dzisiaj chcia\u0142abym opowiedzie\u0107 Wam histori\u0119 mojej choroby, z kt\u00f3r\u0105 \u017cyj\u0119 ju\u017c od ponad 6 lat. Tak naprawd\u0119 nie jest to jednak tylko historia mojej choroby, a historia funkcjonowania opieki zdrowotnej w Polsce.\nWszystko zacz\u0119\u0142o si\u0119 w lutym 2013 roku, mia\u0142am w\u00f3wczas nieca\u0142e 25 lat. Przez kilka dni czu\u0142am nieustanne mrowienie w prawej r\u0119ce. Zapisa\u0142am si\u0119 nawet do neurologa, ale termin oczekiwania by\u0142 d\u0142ugi (ponad miesi\u0105c), a objawy ust\u0105pi\u0142y tak szybko, \u017ce zrezygnowa\u0142am z wizyty i szybko zapomnia\u0142am o ca\u0142ej sytuacji. \n\nNiestety po 3 miesi\u0105cach mrowienia i dr\u0119twienia powt\u00f3rzy\u0142y si\u0119: tym razem ci\u0119\u017cko by\u0142o to po prostu zignorowa\u0107 - przesta\u0142am czu\u0107 swoje cia\u0142o \"normalnie\" od pasa w d\u00f3\u0142. Znowu zapisa\u0142am si\u0119 do neurologa, tym razem by\u0142am na tyle przera\u017cona, \u017ce skorzysta\u0142am z mo\u017cliwo\u015bci zapisania si\u0119 na konsultacj\u0119 \"po znajomo\u015bci\" w trybie pilnym. Neurolog po badaniu stwierdzi\u0142, \u017ce s\u0105 to najprawdopodobniej problemy z kr\u0119gos\u0142upem i zleci\u0142 rezonans magnetyczny dw\u00f3ch odcink\u00f3w kr\u0119gos\u0142upa w trybie pilnym. Na refundowane badanie rezonansem w trybie pilnym czeka si\u0119 oko\u0142o 3 miesi\u0119cy. Wykonanie badania prywatnie to koszt ok. 1000 z\u0142, a jednocze\u015bnie bycie poza wszystkimi procedurami NFZ. W praktyce oznacza to, \u017ce je\u015bli wynik takiego badania wyjdzie nieprawid\u0142owy to pacjent ma za zadanie sam pokierowa\u0107 swoj\u0105 dalsz\u0105 \u015bcie\u017ck\u0105 leczenia - oczywi\u015bcie prywatnie. Postanowi\u0142am poczeka\u0107. \nM\u00f3j stan pogarsza\u0142 si\u0119, a termin badania nadal by\u0142 odleg\u0142y i w ko\u0144cu trafi\u0142am na szpitalny oddzia\u0142 ratunkowy wojew\u00f3dzkiego szpitala w moim mie\u015bcie. Po wst\u0119pnym badaniu neurologicznym nie stwierdzono nieprawid\u0142owo\u015bci, ale od lekarki us\u0142ysza\u0142am: \"U takich m\u0142odych os\u00f3b boimy si\u0119 zawsze stwardnienia rozsianego, ale prosz\u0119 si\u0119 nie martwi\u0107, to raczej nie to. Zostawimy pani\u0105 w szpitalu i zrobimy wszystkie niezb\u0119dne badania diagnostyczne.\" \n\nW szpitalu sp\u0119dzi\u0142am ponad dwa tygodnie - stwardnienie rozsiane (SM) nie jest \u0142atw\u0105 w diagnozowaniu chorob\u0105, objawy pocz\u0105tkowe s\u0105 niespecyficzne i cz\u0119sto mylone z innymi jednostkami chorobowymi. Pierwsze badania nie potwierdza\u0142y podejrze\u0144 SM - lekarze i piel\u0119gniarki cz\u0119sto przychodzili do mnie, pocieszali, m\u00f3wili, \u017ce wszystko b\u0119dzie ok, \u017ce kolejne badania s\u0105 prawid\u0142owe. Czu\u0142am, \u017ce SM to co\u015b strasznego, najgorszego na \u015bwiecie, sugerowa\u0142o to zachowanie personelu medycznego, informacje, kt\u00f3rych zacz\u0119\u0142am wyszukiwa\u0107 w internecie, no i moje samopoczucie. \nMia\u0142am ju\u017c zbadany rezonansem ca\u0142y kr\u0119gos\u0142up, przyszed\u0142 czas na m\u00f3zg. Obraz kliniczny odpowiada\u0142 postawieniu diagnozy SM. Zdecydowano si\u0119 na inwazyjne badanie tzn. punkcje m\u00f3zgowo-rdzeniow\u0105, kt\u00f3ra mia\u0142a ostatecznie potwierdzi\u0107 lub wykluczy\u0107 SM. \n\nBadania potwierdzi\u0142y przypuszczenie SM. Lekarze piel\u0119gniarki i ca\u0142y personel przesta\u0142 ze mn\u0105 rozmawia\u0107. Nikt nie powiedzia\u0142 mi nic o mojej chorobie, mia\u0142am wra\u017cenie, \u017ce diagnoza jest tak straszna, \u017ce nie s\u0105 w stanie spojrze\u0107 mi w oczy. M\u00f3j stan fizyczny nadal si\u0119 nie poprawia\u0142, ale nie by\u0142 bardzo ci\u0119\u017cki - teraz ju\u017c wiem, \u017ce objawy pocz\u0105tkowe mojej choroby mia\u0142y stosunkowo \u0142agodny charakter. Po kilku dniach od postawienia diagnozy.... zosta\u0142am wypisana ze domu. Lekarka prowadz\u0105ca wr\u0119czy\u0142a mojej mamie kart\u0119 wypisu ze szpitala ze s\u0142owami \"Przykro mi\". Przez ca\u0142y czas pobytu w szpitalu nie mia\u0142am okazji porozmawia\u0107 z neurologiem czy psychologiem o swoim stanie, rokowaniach, mo\u017cliwo\u015bciach leczenia. Zosta\u0142am po prostu wypisana do domu \"po nieznacznej poprawie\" (cytat z karty informacyjnej), co by\u0142o oczywistym k\u0142amstwem, bo m\u00f3j stan fizyczny nie uleg\u0142 zianie, natomiast psychicznie by\u0142am zrujnowana. Podobnie jak ca\u0142a moja rodzina.\n\nDzisiaj mog\u0119 powiedzie\u0107, \u017ce uratowa\u0142o mnie tylko to, \u017ce urodzi\u0142am si\u0119 w do\u015b\u0107 uprzywilejowanej rodzinie - wykszta\u0142cona klasa \u015brednia w o\u015brodku miejskim. M\u00f3j ojciec pobie\u017cnie zna\u0142 \u015brodowisko lekarskie i w desperacji zdecydowa\u0142 si\u0119 prosi\u0107 o pomoc w moim przypadku - oczywi\u015bcie \"po znajomo\u015bci\" i prywatnie, chocia\u017c tak naprawd\u0119 leczenie prywatne w przypadku SM nie ma \u017cadnego sensu - koszty miesi\u0119cznej terapii si\u0119gaj\u0105 nawet 5tys. PLN miesi\u0119cznie i nawet mojej \"uprzywilejowanej rodziny\" nie by\u0142oby na ni\u0105 sta\u0107. W ten spos\u00f3b trafi\u0142am pod opiek\u0119 \u015bwietnej lekarki, kt\u00f3ra opowiedzia\u0142a mi wi\u0119cej o chorobie, po kilku wizytach prywatnych skierowa\u0142a mnie na sw\u00f3j oddzia\u0142 w szpitalu i wpisa\u0142a do kolejki na program lekowy (pacjenci z SM w kolejce do programu lekowego czekaj\u0105 ok. roku).\n\n**Min\u0119\u0142o 6 lat, \u017cyj\u0119, mam si\u0119 dobrze, lecz\u0119 si\u0119, jestem sprawna, aktywna i zadowolona z terapii.** \n\nPo co pisz\u0119 t\u0119 histori\u0119?\n\nBo wci\u0105\u017c nie mog\u0119 pogodzi\u0107 si\u0119 z niesprawiedliwo\u015bci\u0105 i z tym, \u017ce brakuje tak niewiele, a jednocze\u015bnie tak du\u017co, aby system opieki nad osobami z SM w Polsce by\u0142 przyjazny i dost\u0119pny. Pod wzgl\u0119dem medycznym pacjenci w Polsce maj\u0105 dost\u0119p do najnowocze\u015bniejszych terapii, takich samych jak w najbardziej rozwini\u0119tych krajach \u015bwiata: Niemczech, Kanadzie czy Australii. Mimo wszystko wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 pacjent\u00f3w z SM nie korzysta z terapii. Dlaczego? Dlaczego lekarze nie potrafi\u0105 rozmawia\u0107 z pacjentem o chorobie? Dlaczego brak wsparcia psychologicznego? Pomocy w zrozumieniu swojej w\u0142asnej choroby? Co maj\u0105 robi\u0107 osoby, kt\u00f3rych nie sta\u0107 nawet na jedn\u0105 czy dwie prywatne wizyty (koszt wizyty to ok. 250PLN) u specjalisty, kt\u00f3ry przekieruje ich do poradni przy szpitalu? Co maj\u0105 zrobi\u0107 osoby z mniejszych o\u015brodk\u00f3w lub takie, kt\u00f3re nie maj\u0105 w bli\u017cszym lub dalszym \u015brodowisku znajomych lekarzy? Osoby, kt\u00f3re nie korzystaj\u0105 sprawnie z internetu? Dzisiaj czuj\u0119 si\u0119 zaopiekowana, ale w ca\u0142ej historii o SM nie chodzi przecie\u017c o mnie. Osoby z nowo zdiagnozowanym SM przechodz\u0105 za\u0142amania nerwowe i ci\u0119\u017ckie depresje. Wiem, bo w trakcie mojej choroby pozna\u0142am kilka os\u00f3b, kt\u00f3re jako bardziej do\u015bwiadczona eSeMka stara\u0142am si\u0119 wesprze\u0107 i pokierowa\u0107 najlepiej jak tylko potrafi\u0142am.\n\nTylko czy to naprawd\u0119 zadanie pacjent\u00f3w, aby wspiera\u0107 siebie nawzajem?", "created_at": "2019-05-31 12:23:53.623995", "updated_at": "2019-06-18 11:09:30.118206", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 875, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 257.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3, 137], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42192, "user_id": 4313, "topic_id": 8079, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Hey @matthias and @alberto would love to meet you both. \n\nFeel free to send me a suitable time for you between 09.00-17.00 CET monday-friday.\n\nAlso we have a volunteer team of developers, and I don't know if you could provide any assistance to them?\n\nThey are really cool people from all around the world that just recently got together to asisst the movement.

I'm a Trinity MBA with a background in advanced marketing technology and I've spent the last few years working on technology that contributes to structural changes in the way we all work.\n\nWe provide virtual meeting rooms - a digital office space that is consistent and available from anywhere. We bring body language to meetings, focused on highly collaborative and participative meetings. Teams are more engaged, build rapport and achieve more than using traditional tele-presence. People use it for specific types of meetings. for high-participative, highly collaborative meetings of approximately three to 20 people, rather than one-to-one or one-to-many.\n\nThe idea for me is not to get everyone to wear these headsets all the time, but for people to be able to see one another when they need to. I know everyone's crazy for asynchronous communication right now, but for me this is the next stage. It cuts down on notifications which keeps people focused, until it\u2019s time to show up for a meeting, just like in real life.\n\nPre-COVID we had interest from specific teams - now that we have began adjusting as a global society, we are seeing more and more types of organisations looking to improve their collaborative efforts. We're seeing a lot of different co-working spaces looking to get people back with their bums on seats, but it\u2019s about getting people to look beyond and say, \"Look, what if I was here two days a week instead of three, what if I was here four days a week instead of the full five? How does that affect us?\"\n\nThere is a huge amount of interest in what we do at the moment. but in terms of bringing it through we've been focused on working with large enterprises. We know who we want to work with and we know who we can help today, and tomorrow. Our solution fits in in particular ways, and we don't try and compete with tools like Teams or Zoom, because that's not the point. We act as complementary tech for small group collaboration. We're in addition to your existing tool set, in the same way video calls didn't get rid of email.\n\nWhen a meeting is one to one, or one person addressing a crowd, video works really well. Where we kick in is when the \"Brady Bunch\" grid doesn't work. We focus on those three to 20 person group meetings, where you want to know whose turn it is to speak, where you want to make sure that everybody's engaged. A problem cannot always be solved or fleshed out via a Teams orSlack thread, or with four or five on one call - that\u2019s the difference between communication and collaboration. Our calls are very much a case of everyone's in, it's high energy and it's getting real problems solved.\n\nA lot of the tools that we are using these days are built for people to be on all the time, which turns into a notification battle station. That works to a certain point, but you get used to being driven by notification as opposed to driven by outcome. For us it's very much the latter rather than the former; the real collaboration as opposed to people showing up the right way on video calls.\n\nThe next stage of virtual collaboration is going to be VR first. Not just adding brand new tools to the stack, but changing behaviourally how people are operating, how they're working together. Our vision is to have over a billion people, or a billion task oriented rooms being used in our platform, and the idea is that there\u2019s a different mindset to each space. For example, I\u2019m here in the green room talking to you, and I might be going to a red \u201cmanagement\u201d room afterwards, which could mean being prepared for a tougher conversation, then meeting a customer in the blue room, where I want to make sure I'm in closer mode. Context switching is something we focus on, to ensure everyone is sure what is on the agenda for a particular meeting. \n\nWe learn by doing. Humans are social creatures, we get together to learn. When we're introducing people to a room, it's a tour, just as though I was showing you guys where we work at Regus today. Every client who comes on board with us is enrolled in our academy, which starts with a bit of education, but then then we're going to dig into what might this mean to your business, saying look, what are your metrics, what does it actually mean to you.\n\nThe industry is too young for people to be able to say, \"Hey, this is what we're doing, and this is what we're going to do for it, and here's the exact outcome we're going to get at the end.\" \n\nAfter the last four months, we're just starting to get to that point where people actually are able to reflect and say, \"okay, we made it through here.\" This period has meant an acceleration of what was already happening, and a lot of people have gotten two or three years worth of learning in three months. They are understanding that they can get away with working remotely and they want to be really specific about the competitive advantages they can bring out from that. Virtual meetings are a part of that.\n\nHow the co-working space themselves might adopt this is really simple. It might be adding a few extra rooms in a digital sense to their existing booking system, offering it as extra services to their memberships. More and more corporates are starting to look at co-working spaces, not just in the capital cities but also in a rural sense of things. \n\nWe can all agree that you'll never have one tool that fits everything for all teams, but it's still very much at the fledgling stage. This period has probably been the biggest output of our virtual and physical lives converging, and physical co-working spaces are best positioned to make their competitive advantage the fact that their offices are safest. We link in on top of that.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around generally, but overall, I suppose the biggest challenge from a technology point of view is that most people haven't tried these headsets before. Normally, you'd have someone on site to show them how to use it, to make sure it's a good first time experience, but that\u2019s all changed. On demand that actually helps with that behaviour change we mentioned earlier on, is all the more important. The best way to get people to adopt or to react and educate to these things is, making sure that everyone has the same ability to participate.\n\nWhat we always ask, at every stage, is this a good solution? Is this a good fit for this kind of problem? It's got to make a difference to the bottom line, to the budget, in terms of the business drivers. It\u2019s about removing subjectivity and making sure it's all objective. That's what we really focus on.\n\nWe're a VR-first platform, but by design we're a cross-platform. We let people come in from every device as they would today. \n\nOne of our own strong points is that we're not afraid to say no. We go through a discovery process with every large enterprise, that lasts anything up to 30 days. The reasoning for that is coming in with that mindset makes it a little bit easier not to be disappointed if it gets to that point, but for us it's always treating it as an objective. On the flip side, if we're not the right solution we get out of your ways as fast as possible and try to point you in the right direction. \n\nWe have some really strong partnerships building up at the moment and while we're not publicly released at the moment, that's a burning question on a lot of people's brains right now. Our focus, though, is very much on the large enterprise end of things. We prefer to point people in their direction, as opposed to take it on ourselves, because we have a specific set of skills. \n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n![37bc7a02ea7da6c5578c05f5ec5daaf8051be294_2_1380x776|690x388](upload://sWERRANdZc0cFVUI7ea9sTuu3Q4.jpeg) \n*Meet Jonny at our event on 21/7.

That means that your community is probably quite stable - what is the average time for the membership of a coworker? I can imagine that with a high turnover, this wouldn't be possible. Then again, if the co-workers are the same people also sharing a house together, then the relationships are probably deeper and the whole system benefits from more trust and loyalty?\n\nI also notice a paradox: you say that the cowork space is nowadays empty and therefore losing money, but also that the shift is towards other in-house company offices closing down and those employees coming to use your space - so  perhaps it's all just a matter of hanging in there till the new normal settles in?\n\nI'm happy to share more about our space in Brussels - now turned into an office for the people living there, not just for the Edgeryders co-workers. Perhaps good to mention: one of the things we discovered while trying to co-design a larger Reef is that while a shared office is useful in the house, work cannot be the common denominator for those living in the house - people looking into co-living are concerned about the trust relationships, the in group bounds first and foremost, with the shared office being just a function of the house, but not the centerpiece.", "created_at": "2020-07-13 09:16:09.843995", "updated_at": "2020-07-13 09:16:09.843995", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 256, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 46.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [80267], "is_reply_to": [80267], "is_liked_by": [8, 6512], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23510, "user_id": 1658, "topic_id": 3620, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Connections and Lote4 Session</b>\n\nThis looks great :)\u00a0<a href=\"/u/hazem\">@Hazem</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/u/dorotea\">@Dorotea</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/u/danohu\">@danohu</a>\u00a0let me know if you need me to connect you to people I have met in Berlin and the best way to do that.\u00a0\n\nI am writing up a session for LOTE4 to categorise different forms of Stewardship.

Applications for 2017 have since opened. We have decided to apply, since it rests nicely with our Open Village operations in MENA and helps strengthen our ties with parts of the community. \n\n[The original concept note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_tzNpA40bnywN22AoEJbGGm8CxQP-ung4lPgGAem60I/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs) will be treated only as a point of departure, because (a) the priorities for 2017 have since been unveiled and (b) as we thought about it, things got clearer in our head. We are now envisioning a **multi-site citizen science project in the MENA region, such as civic monitoring of water quality**. Data are collected, released as open data and discussed online (\"What are we seeing? Can we trust our data as evidence? Can/should we do anything to improve water quality?\"). Both the datasets and the results of the discussion are then offered to the local authorities as a contribution. \n\nThe idea is:\n\n1. Democratic activism by young people can be problematic, as \u00e9lites fear it might degenerate into unrest and view it with suspicion.\n\n2. On the other hand, all countries in the region are clamouring for STEM.\n\n3. That makes science a safer (and rhetorically more powerful) way to participate.\n\n4. Additionally, people in our community are worried that biohacking is coming to Africa in an \"imperialistic\" way.\n\n5. So, we use the project to train (northern) Africans in basic wet lab skills and data interpretation. We propose a model of mentoring; slightly more senior people in the biohacker community train \"absolute beginners\", like Rachel did in the Open Village Festival.\n\n6. We give the project a strong gender focus, calling in the female biohackers we know to both make up an advisory board and get involved on the ground as mentors) and prioritising women and girls as participants to the project. Again, this is about preventing the biohacking scene to become female-unfriendly as the software hacking did. It can be done in Africa, where the scene is still embryonic at best and nonexistent at worst. When the first spaces open, basic wet lab skills will be more than most people have. \n\n7. We partner up with local community spaces. Ideally some of them will end up starting biohacking labs.\n\nPartnership:\n\n* Edgeryders\n* [Arab women center for training and research](https://www.facebook.com/CenterofArabWomenforTrainingandResearch)\n* Yosser's [OurGhema](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ourghema-how-far-is-it-going/7740) as a community space\n\nWe cover the following UNDEF priority areas:\n\n* Gender Equality\n* Community Activism\n* Youth engagement\n* Strengthening civil society interaction with Government\n* Tools for knowledge\n\n\n### Questions\n\n1. **Does this sound like the kind of stuff they would consider doing?**\n\n2. **We could do this as a one-country project or a multi-country one.

Additionally / in other words, I see the project responding to democratic opportunities in four areas:\n\n* **environmental and infrastructure management** through community led citizen science and biohacking responses\n* the burgeoning **fablab/ living labs/ social entrepreneurship/ smart city fields** by incubating women practitioners and fostering inclusive workplaces towards a gender equal/ **democratized labour market**\n* **access to knowledge, knowledge production** and autonomy in the context of digital neocolonialism, where the development of \u201cSmart Africa\u201d calls for a response from empowered citizens in the face of increasing monopolies driven by Western capitalist interests\n* **civil society decision-making and governance models** that respond directly to the needs and cultural specificities of each community rather than unsuitable or exclusive \u201cdemocratic\u201d models\n\n**AMBITION:**\n\nDevelop a **MENA regional network of female changemakers** in the citizen science, livinglabs and smart cities fields that responds to an already male dominated labour market and cultivates opportunities for grassroots governance of local resources\n\nThis could look like:\n\n* Establish a **fellowship program for young women leaders** in the MENA region that will offer mentoring and resources to coordinate a **protoype citizen science initiative**\n\n* 1 - 2 fellows will be chosen from **Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt**, countries where Edgeryders is currently establishing its OpenVillage network and therefore will have resources and local collaborators available\n\n* **Strategic, collaborating and grassroots community partners** will guide and support each fellow and their community teams through the following stages:\n    * Situational and stakeholder analysis and project co-design\n    * Establish grassroots community partners across fablabs, living labs, co-working spaces\n    * Data gathering on local environment and infrastructure using citizen science tools\n    * Knowledge sharing, community management and coordination of responses on the ER platform\n    * Undertake biohacking response projects that address the findings of the data gathering\n\n* Underpinning these stages will be ongoing:\n    * skills development workshops for the fellows\n    * analyse of the collective intelligence on the ER platform through Graphryders\n    * community consultations across the local civil society networks \n\n* It is intended that at the end of each initiative, the findings - as an **open data** - will be presented to local governments and decision-makers by Edgeryders and its local strategic partners, with the intention of fostering an **ongoing government supported program** \n\n**In summary:**\n\n_Data gathering provides_ \n\n* Access to training and skills development\n* Platforms for dialogue, visibility, mutual understanding and social cohesion across the horizontal and vertical axis of the community \n* Data on local community, ecological and infrastructure needs\n\n_Data informs_\n\n* Autonomous response projects led by community members\n* Policy makers and other decision-makers\n\n_Responses provide_\n\n* Access to training and skills development\n* Opportunities and visibility for women and youth leaders\n* Increasingly inlusive fablabs/ social entrepreneurship/ smart cities labour market\n* Conservation and development of resources\n* Strengthened civil society through community collaboration\n\n**RESOURCING:**\n\n_Overarching strategic partners_\n\n* MENA and civil society\n* MENA and gender\n* MENA and smart cities/ social entrepreneurship\n\n_Collaborating partners_\n\n* Women training and mentorship\n* Citizen science\n* Biohacking\n\n_Grassroots partners_\n\n* Fellows\n* Open Village houses\n* Living Labs/ co-working spaces\n\n_Current partners being explored_\n\n* [Making All Voices Count](http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/) (Africa region civil society specialists) \n* [Hivos](https://mena.hivos.org/) (MENA region gender equality, policy advocacy and leadership specialists)\n* [Centre for Arab Women Training and Research](http://www.cawtar.org/SitePages/AboutUs.aspx) **This would actually be more through the Fondazione Brondolini's project [Regional Gender Advisory Services Programme 2016 \u2013 Frameworks for Access to Employment & Skills]((http://www.fondazionebrodolini.it/en/projects/regional-gender-advisory-services-programme-2016-frameworks-access-employment-skills))\n* [Roots Lab](https://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/our-work/gender-justice/womens-participation-and-transformative-leadership/roots-lab) (MENA regional female changemaker initiative) \n* [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/) (citizen science tools and tactics)\n* [Hackerium](http://wiki.hackuarium.ch/w/Main_Page#What_is_Hackuarium.3F) (biohacking)\n* [The Green Land](https://thegreenland.eu/?lang=en) (open data, policy advocacy)\n* [Search for Common Ground](https://www.sfcg.org/mena) (women leaders, track II diplomacy, community dialogue in conflict zones)\n\n_Other potentially relevant stakeholders_\n\n* [FRIDA Young Feminist Fund](https://youngfeministfund.org/what-we-do/)\n* Eg.

To give some background on us. We are two sisters Barbara Nolan and myself CarolAnn Hickey who come from a commercial property background mainly based in Malahide in Dublin, Ireland. In August 2019 we setup a co-working office space in one of our units called M-Space Malahide. It holds 19 people and its has top floor panoramic sea views over the water so it is a truly lovely space to work, We were consistently at 50% capacity when Covid19 hit. \n\nOnce that hit all our members retreated home & we shut down. Slowly our members are returning this month and we have some new members trying it out. But like everyone its a hard time as we all have to start again and re-invent ourselves.

The pros may seem plausible (and only have potential stakeholders/winners) but the cons seem probable (and often much more obvious to existing stakeholders). On top of that you may not even think of 8 of the 10 most important (positive or negative) changes before they are reliably entrenched.\n\nThat is why I rather lean to small scale doing &amp; documenting as approach. Perhaps the documentation should be done by three different parties to get more perspectives. Incremental changes are cool but tend to run into diminishing returns. Once you are faced with even a slight pressure for radical change (I'd argue that was about 30-40 years ago for \"The West\") you look for small and resilient (ineffective?) communities for which you can nicely document the inflows and outflows of their systems, give them an incentive (or simply permission) to change and watch closely.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-11-23 21:42:22", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:15.862972", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 202, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11758], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40031, "user_id": 4196, "topic_id": 6785, "post_number": 15, "raw": "Being a Sci-Fi Nerd, and especially a Cyberpunk fan, this hugely reminds me of the transnational post-state entities Bruce Sterling describes in _Islands in the Net_, or the Phyles Neil Stephenson describes in _Snow Crash_ and _The Diamond Age_. \n\n> Society in The Diamond Age is dominated by a number of phyles, also sometimes called tribes. Phyles are groups of people often distinguished by shared values, similar ethnic heritage, a common religion, or other cultural similarities. In the extremely globalized future depicted in the novel, these cultural divisions have largely supplanted the system of nation-states that divides the world today. Cities in The Diamond Age appear divided into sovereign enclaves affiliated or belonging to different phyles within a single metropolis. Most phyles depicted in the novel have a global scope of sovereignty, and maintain segregated enclaves in or near many cities throughout the world. - _Wikipedia/The Diamond Age_\n\nSo I can easily see Edgeryders becoming something like this, but in a good way. (In Cyberpunk, many of these are ultra-neoliberal, which I understand Edgeryders to be the opposite of) \n\nThis is to say, I like the Idea a lot, to be Part of the ER Network, visiting and working in the different places and using it in all the ways you describe. \n\n---\n\nNow to details:\n\n[quote=\"matthias, post:1, topic:6785\"]\nMarketers can use Google Translate to understand foreign language websites, and online translation services to translate marketing texts into European languages.\n[/quote]\n\nAlso, inside the Network it shouln't be difficult to find someone to check the automatic translation to avoid it being terrible. \n\nFor Example, I could check German texts.\n\n[quote=\"Yosser, post:7, topic:6785\"]\nso only the people who are within the network can order the products\n[/quote]\n\nWouldn't this narrow the amount of customers down to a fraction?\nAnd why not enable the single places to have an offline store? - If ER already \"imports\" these products from other continents, why not sell them in-house? This might depend heavily on the location of the Place, and on the Place Manager, or someone else, who will have the additional duty of manning the store. This might be tested once there this many houses. \n\n[quote=\"Yosser, post:13, topic:6785\"]\nwomen in the rural areas, and even women who wants to work from their homes in Medenine to earn some money, maybe we can have them trained by professionals and then they can start making their own artisanal crafts within the space, so through that we would invest in women whom would invet in themselves and other people as well\n[/quote]\n\nI like this Idea a lot. It's like outsourcing done right. Like, today scottish fish is shipped to china, prepared there, shipped back to the same village in scotland and sold there as being local (which is true). This is done because it's cheaper than processing it in scotland. But global outsourcing doesn't have to be like this.

I think the project will be in very safe hands with @winnieponcelet/ReaGent as the lead. \n\nIf you need though, I'd love to contribute to the conceptual part of the biohacking/community project. Urban gardening/farming is a great topic with lots of scope for implementation of DIY scientific practices in a valuable way. In Berlin we're trying to get a project started around community bioremediation of urban soils. I think this could be a very valuable practice for urban farming communities, should be very DIY-able, and taps into a wider discourse around land ownership, responsibility, preserving and reclaiming the commons. In case it fits, I'd love to see something like this take off inside an edgeryders project, whether together with or in parallel to our efforts in Berlin, and would be happy to help where needed with the proposal if you need this kind of detail. \n\nWe've already been working on building a network around the project and are already well connected with Prinzessinnengarten (long-established urban gardening project in Berlin) and various biohacking friends, and are looking to find funding ourselves.

I am used to conferences where people submit work, and the best of it is allowed to be presented. So my question was how many men vs women presented their work. Of course if we are speaking about invited speakers, then it is much harder to judge. In theory it would be fair if the percentage reflected the imbalance there is in reality. But I have no way of judging this. Plus such analysis would hardly be objective. And sometimes the organisers invite people from a minority to air out hard to find voices. That's their prerogative. So it should then approach 50% more... if the organisers felt the women had a different point of view that needed to be presented. This is the problem with conferences where people are invited. There really is a lot of power in the hands of the organisers. And this is why I usually prefer conferences where people can submit their own work!\n\nI absolutely agree that there are vast rages of possibilities yet to be explored. And more power to you if you can come up with formula that appeals also to women.\n\nBut one thing I know for sure, coding is absolutely not all there is.

There is however no legal form \u201cnot profit\u201d in Sweden, but for-profit organizations (foundations or other corporate entities) are registered as such. The non profit status is therefore deduced e contrario.\n\nOur problem is that the EU demands a document stating that we are a non-profit. As far as I know there is no official documents available that I could use to prove that we are not for profit (the combination of our approved statutes and a statement from the tax authority of not being subject to corporate tax or VAT was not sufficient). It might be possible to get a statement from some official that the registry works the way it works, or a statement from some non-official. We are presently trying to figure out how to get such a statement.\n\nI have spoken with the local Horizon 2020 representative in Sweden and she recommended the combination of tax-registration and statutes that I already had used - and that the EU explicitly rejected.\u00a0\n\nHowever, we cannot be the first non-profit foundation (or organization) that the EU have funded historically so there must be a solution.\n\nErik Lakomaa\n\n", "created_at": "2015-08-27 09:39:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:59.803758", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 267, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87974, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 14988, "post_number": 7, "raw": "@owen how do I edit the campaign contribution  buttons at the bottom (where they point to)?", "created_at": "2020-12-02 08:12:09.224718", "updated_at": "2020-12-02 08:12:09.224718", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10660, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 3289, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>On it</b>\n\nThanks for the feedback, Khatuna.\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>I can certainly add a bit of explanation to the Semantics page.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>You can perform the network analysis by yourselves, but that requires you teach yourselves a little bit of Tulip. <a href=\"/u/brenoust\">@Benjamin Renoust</a>\u00a0has added links to Tulip files at the end of <a href=\"/draft-of-network-analysis-report\">this post</a>: this means that the files have already been built, so you don't need to re-run the scripts (though you can, there are also links to the code) and can start exploring the graphs right away.

My wife was also in hospital early this year, so I TOTALLY understand (we have a now-nearly-three-year-old daughter).\n\nYes -- when you have time, more would be very nice ;-) I think I am following you. You are pointing out, which is true, that people are generally less interested in the products they supply than in the income they receive by producing them, selling them and therefore receiving money, so that they can acquire the things they really want, such as food, clothes, house, car, medical care, going to the theater, etc.\n\nIn a market economy the \"information system\" which has historically been remarkably efficient, has been built around the strong desire of people to live as well as they can, and therefore they seek out what people want so as to produce it and acquire money so they can fund the lifestyle to which they would like to become accustomed, etc. This has all been informal and pretty much word-of-mouth.\n\nIf you look at Amazon, this is a company that comes as close as I can think of at this time to what I think you are suggesting. They are putting together suppliers and customers, and acquire tons of data on the demand for everything they sell, as well as how much of it is sold. They busily suggest products to customers based on what they have bought or looked for in hopes of selling them more of it. This can be run as a utopia or a dystopia, depending on how you look at it, but it has proven to be a much more effective and efficient way of matching buyer and seller than any system previously invented.\n\nNow, of course the majority of production in the economy is not end products, but labor -- capital (in the economic sense of machinery and buildings used for production) is second.

So, it is always privately optimal to dump the cost of healing onto others, rather than assume the cost of prevention oneself.\u00a0\n\nSeen through this lens, community provision is fundamentally different, because the entity receiving the care is not an individual, but the (sub-Dunbar or equivalent) community,\u00a0<em>and that's the same as the payer.\u00a0</em>Hence the apparent lack of market failure in care provision among the Amish.\u00a0\n\nSo what's going on with prevention of unwanted pregnancies? Public health people I have talked to tend to shrug and say it's endemic. The window of opportunity for stupid and careless behaviour\u00a0is a little too wide, the drive for instant gratification over prudence is literally a biological imperative, and even the best contraceptives only have a 99.99% effectiveness. If, say, in Italy you have about 20 million couples, if 10% of them are having sex tonight and all of them use contraception, you are going to get 200 unwanted pregnancies <em>tonight,</em>\u00a0in just one European country. Best you can do is reduce the incidence of such incidents, but no human society ever achieved zero unwanted pregnancies.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-19 20:00:12", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:16.932306", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 302, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23368], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13552, "user_id": 605, "topic_id": 1325, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>I agree..</b>\n\nWhen I read John's story it just came to my mind this exact image..

I know this is short but it is still a draft and I hope @Driss will have time to update this wiki though I know he is very busy with work these days.\n\nTo address some of your questions, Driss is the founder and the leader of the team but each one works hard and contributes equally. He said his customers are mostly friends and friends of friends who get to know about his services from the word of mouth.\u00a0\n\nYou are right, the approach of the company depends on the flush of money and @Driss did mention that they hardly make ends meet as lots of customers pay very late<span>(up to 3 months)</span> after delivery and they struggle to find money to start a new project. I did advise him to ask for a deposit but he said it would not work as the other companies do not require one, so they would lose the customer that way.\n\nConcerning the attitude of parents/family, I'd like to mention, there is a huge gap between the new generation and the parents in Morocco, more than anywhere. Just imagine that parents can be illiterate and never traveled out of their village/town while the new generation is so much more active, they use internet, travel and have a broader view of life. So, as I see it, most of young people don't even try to upgrade their parents and just live their lives trying to combine the traditions with modernity. What parents care most about is that their children are safe and earning money/supporting them financially, the details are not important to them.\u00a0\n\nI remember, a few years ago when my husband told his mom that I'm considering a job in a guesthouse(as a manager) and she thought I am going to be a cleaning lady!I was first offended but then my husband explained to me that\u00a0<span>this was the top of her imagination of what can one do in a riad(traditional luxury guesthouse in the old town of Marrakech).</span>\n\nThis is not always the case, but we need to remember that Morocco has over 50% illiteracy and the ones that can only write their names are considered literate in this statistics.\n\nWhile in big cities there is a lot going on, the rest of the country still struggles to have running water, electricity and schools available in every village. Females start getting higher education and having more power in the business and government, however lots of them still do not have the chance to pursue a career/education because of lack of support from family/society/governmental institutions.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-08 09:37:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:32.563711", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 519, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86200, "user_id": 4968, "topic_id": 14654, "post_number": 37, "raw": "Hi, sorry not sure whether this pertains to the discussion on LC-GD-10-2-2020 call:\nBojan Bobic has contacted Francesca Rosignoli to invite her contribution in an EU Green Deal call; and Francesca contacted me (as we work together in Energy Justice Italy team).

Why do we discuss abortion at all? Once we solve the main problem, my body, my choice, the abortion problem will be no more.

And of course women rights are part of it but it's just about human rights in general now. So yes its good to have women protesting but it is not enough now to save us from global dictatorship.

In some countries you may have the right to get abortion, still you are forced to put your kids at school as soon as 3 years old and you are not allowed to decide how to take care about their health because the state does.

Probably after decades of liberal regulations to some extent women are aware of the fact that abortions are needed, but catholic brainwashing has been so effective, that they're trapped between the moral and the pragmatic views on abortion. Now what seems to prove this is that women are not interested in lobbying for their right to abortion - they somehow agree to comply with the rules by having them underground and accepting the stigma, rather than fighting\u00a0for their rights. Imagine even if the lowest estimate of 80.000 women having illegal abortions a year is right, and 10 percent of them would be up to fight with the system on that, we'd have a pretty great leverage to change the law by now. But we don't. have that. Well, at least until now - but this remains to be seen because we also have a conservative revival going on and if the church steps in, you never know who'd stay on top of things. I'd rather not expect us going any more liberal than we're at the moment.\u00a0\n\nAnother thing is that part of the available options just use the loopholes, they're not illegal.

We're observing a bit mobilization of civil society ever since the new government came into power, but that rarely brought any results. At the end, they use their democratic victory to pass any decision they seem fit - and giving up on a project of an outrageous reform just to keep rather shameful status quo is not a huge failure for them I believe.

I wrote \"potentially\". Of course disinformation exists. Since it exists, it follows that *any* source is \"potentially\" suspicious. \n\nIn cases where science has established something beyond reasonable doubt, I even *support* censorship in certain contexts, like education and mass media. For example, some people believe the universe is 6,000 years old, created by God like the Bible say. These people have their own paleontologists and scholars, their journals and universities. And they say \"teach the controversy between creationism and evolutionism in American schools!\". Their opponents say there is no more controversy, evolution has won it long ago. Let them keep their conferences, of course, but do not teach 16th century science in 21st century schools.\n\nSomething similar goes with climate change: denialists have also research institutes and deep pockets. They use them to get policies in favor of fracking and things like that. \"Why should we sacrifice our ways of life just because of some lousy prediction made by some scientists? Here, we have our own counterpredictions!\" And if you shut them down, they (rightly) call it censorship. But you still want to shut them down, because their tactic is doing real damage (if you believe the other side, which I do). \n\nWith COVID we do not know much yet, it is not a situation like creationism and climate change denial.

If asset-less people get business in barter but not (enough) in money, state can't do anything: there are no assets to liquidate, debtor's prison does not exist any more. Monetary tax debt loses its meaning for those who have no money anyway.\n\nThe only option is that state starts accepting tax in barter. And we'd welcome that: I want to emphasize that I'm not against the existence of government, in the functional definition of enabling synergy and stability in society through organization. In the case of mass unemployment, state services (like the monetary system) are obviously lacking, and innovation gets its legitimacy from that. Which means, iInnovators do not have to ask for permission to replace what does not work. Their innovation may even become a better state service after some time of conflict \u2013 in our case, when state starts to accept taxes in barter, and we woudl welcome that.\n\nI'm curious when Pirate Bay becomes a state service for content dissemination :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2013-06-06 18:32:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:42.373529", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 344, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 1457, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 42913, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 8297, "post_number": 15, "raw": " [quote=\"alberto, post:12, topic:8297\"]\nThree separate fora, one for citizen biochemistry, one for citizen ethnography and (maybe) one for citizen experimental econ. \nOne single forum on citizen science . \nOne single forum as a top-level category. divided into three sub-categories.\n[/quote]\n\nGreat discussion on this.

My call is this:\n\n* Case 1: the local community already has a lively, widely used online platform. In this case, the best is they keep using it. We will need to audit the specific situation: for example, it they are using Facebook, we kind of have a problem, both legal and technical. It is not long-term sustainable to to SSNA out of Facebook, but we could conceivably make it work during a funded project, where we can allocate paid technical support. That is pretty dreary work, though.\n* Case 2: the local community does not have a lively, widely used online platform. This can be because the community is being convened around this experiment or project, like  I imagine the case of Milan. In this case, the best solution is to allocate a category within edgeryders.eu. There are great technical benefits (the stack of tools just work, single sign-in and techno-social proximity with the other CCCP communities) and almost no social costs. If the community wants to keep going after the project, it can keep hanging out in Edgeryders; or export its data and set up its own Discourse (which is far and away the best open source solution for forums); or again adopt Edgeryders whitelabelling, which will have grown more mature. \n\nWorks?", "created_at": "2018-03-30 09:08:59.051600", "updated_at": "2018-03-30 09:08:59.051600", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 222, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 103.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [43374], "is_liked_by": [3362, 3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85746, "user_id": 3206, "topic_id": 14472, "post_number": 9, "raw": "I actually know more than you think about the inequalities in your country, the effect the northern hemisphere on Africa.

I am now a foreigner in my own country as well as in my country of residence...and I had to work 10 times more than any local to prove I earned my spot.

Our model is completely antagonist and tries something new: we believe in open and transparent news, to restore trust between authors and audience, to enhance the quality of the investigations, backwards from \u201cmass-click\u201d and to allow citizens to reinvest in such educational and journalistic mandatory work regarding our future and present challenges. Our platform is now ready to welcome our first communities, and because collective intelligence is at its core, it would be better to start these with constructive people.\n\nTo join us, drop your e-mail through the \u201cJoin Us\u201d button in the above right corner (see link below).

We started from a problem, a practical one, and try to find out practical solutions.

Of Austro-Egyptian origin, I founded and have served as founding director and teaching fellow at the Cairo Institute of Liberal Arts and Sciences CILAS -- a floating micro-liberal arts college situated in Fatimid Cairo -- since 2013. On the side, I offer courses in classical and contemporary sociology at the American University in Cairo.\n\nRecent talks I\u2019ve given and which could give you a sense of my inquiries were at a critical geography conference in Ramallah on the global emergence of liberal arts educations in relation to space; on aesthetic education and the importance of play (grounds) at the Dutch Institute in Cairo; and on the task of the liberal educator at a conference on liberal education at the University of Chicago. A writing project I've been working on with five scholarly friends introduces the notion of a pigeon tower as a metaphor to guide us in our efforts to re-envision higher education.\n\nI wish to tell you here a bit about CILAS: a scholarly cooperative guided by the principles of play, intimacy, ignorance, trans-disciplinarity and diversity CILAS was conceived of after a mostly joyous academic training in political philosophy, social anthropology and urban sociology and a predominantly disillusioning professional experience with so-called development cooperation.\n\nI suppose my work with CILAS could be summed up in two steps. The first step is to cater food for thought either to those left undernourished by the traditional (read modern/colonial) university, to people denied access to university altogether or to those who refuse to \"waste time\" at a traditional university. The second step is to provide shelter in a neighbourhood to make it effectively accessible to people from different walks of life to assemble around a meal (a range of topics) and eat together (contemplate, think and co-create knowledge).\n\nI created CILAS \u2013 first and foremost as a liberal arts-focused space \u2013 in appreciation of the tradition of the liberal arts which I was fortunate to have access to; and out of a sense of responsibility stemming from a sense of belonging to the Egyptian people in their entirety, beyond the confines of class and citizenship. CILAS has been inviting students on ten-month long faluka (an ancient Egyptian sail boat) rides; hence, the image of the faluka as portrayed in CILAS' logo. In other words, CILAS has been inviting students to engage with the liberal arts under a pedagogy of discovery. \n\nThe liberal arts are tricky to wrap up in one bundle. It's, however, precisely this un-wrappability or un-packageability that helps the liberal arts escape turning into a consumer product. It therefore goes without saying that an invitation to engage with the liberal arts is one that must operate within a pedagogy of discovery as opposed to the pedagogy of consumption that is becoming common currency in light of the corporatization of higher education. The metaphor of the faluka still resonates with when conceiving of CILAS, as I hastened to leave the so-called development world behind which had felt much too blatantly like a neo-colonial voyage on a cruise ship. This is how, together with E.F. Schumacher, I embraced the beauty of smallness and was drawn into sailing along the Nile rather than contributing to the command of yet another colonial voyage.\n\nThe mission statement as first formulated for CILAS was to offer students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds access to a liberal arts education. The vision, as first articulated, was to co-create a learning environment that would be conducive to critical inquiry, self-reflection and civic engagement. The immediacy of this statement served as a reminder of the social solidarity that had crystallised as part of the revolutionary momentum of the times. The vision was an implicit call for action to re-appropriate space in an effort to honour the generative force released during that revolutionary moment. Both the statement and vision played on the idea of grounding the liberal arts; of transforming them from something remote, mistakenly vague, void of instrumental value, liberal \u2013 carrying as it did a vilified connotation in Egypt's post-revolutionary, politicised climate \u2013 into something, well, artsy, that is, generating no practical, i.e. monetary, outcome. \n\nSo much for step one. With regards to step two, it occurred to me that the January 25th revolution had brought formation of reading circles and discussion groups that covered a wide array of topics relating to the potentials of the historical juncture presenting itself to Egypt's youth. What I noticed at the time is that many of the initiatives often came to an abrupt end within one to three months. I felt that an inviting and warm space paired with a loose program structure could do the trick in enticing eager learners to pull through despite the lack of formal recognition (accreditation).\n\nIndeed, the loose structure consisting of a fairly intense core curriculum and thematic coursework that would respond to students\u2019 concerns and questions struck the balance between intellectually challenging and imposed, and intellectually intriguing and self-directed. It is this balance that I think about most these days and that I find captured in the notion of play (properly understood!) and the metaphor of the pigeon tower, as I'd like to think of it.\n\nI shall say a bit more soon ...\n\nThank you for reading and for your questions and comments.\n\nWith best wishes\nKarim-Yassin", "created_at": "2017-09-08 17:55:01.146155", "updated_at": "2017-09-09 19:54:18.455801", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 911, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 1018.4, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3729, 2095, 3826, 1935, 2915, 3904], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40115, "user_id": 3769, "topic_id": 6670, "post_number": 32, "raw": "Life is a beautiful Zyara <3", "created_at": "2017-12-08 09:17:30.479413", "updated_at": "2018-01-01 18:55:25.444857", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 6, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 21.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3629], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87822, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14632, "post_number": 69, "raw": "Ping @Leonie @MariaEuler @johncoate.

This might be a small to medium farm, a coffee cooperative of small farmers, or a small artisanal roastery in coffee-consuming countries. For all of these cases, even your small color sorter is too expensive and has way more capacity than they need. So there is the opportunity that they'd buy a cheaper, smaller machine.\n\nAs [we found out](/t/id/8074/10), a worker can sort 5 kg of green beans per hour under average conditions. So, 200 kg in a 40 hour work week. On the other hand, your small sorter, when running 24/7, can process 250 kg/h * 24 hours/day * 7 days = 42 tons per week, as much as 42,000 kg/week / 200 kg/worker/week = 210 workers. That's way more than most manual sorting operations need. They might have 5 - 30 workers for sorting, could be replaced with a sorter sorting 25 kg per hour, replacing 21 workers.\n\nI'm not proposing to put these workers out of business, but to enable small farms etc. to produce higher quality coffee instead of selling it unsorted to wholesalers. Because then they get a much better price for their coffee as well.\n\nI hope this makes it clear, otherwise I can explain it more.

And to be able to know what type of initiatives one can take one needs to know that, or just shoot and maybe hit the wrong target.\n\nBut that is a different topic all together.\n\nI am happy to join the next ethno call and see from there how it develops to see how it could be used more practically in CM :).", "created_at": "2020-09-30 16:48:49.464738", "updated_at": "2020-09-30 16:48:49.464738", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 207, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 42.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [84029], "is_reply_to": [84029], "is_liked_by": [3, 3323], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2714, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 2681, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u0544\u056b \u0576\u0578\u0580 \u0561\u0577\u056d\u0561\u0580\u0570 \u0567 \u057d\u057f\u0565\u0572\u056e\u057e\u0578\u0582\u0574, \u0570\u0565\u0576\u0581 \u0570\u056b\u0574\u0561, \u0561\u0575\u0576 \u0574\u0561\u0580\u0564\u056f\u0561\u0576\u0581 \u0571\u0565\u057c\u0584\u0565\u0580\u0578\u057e, \u0578\u057e\u0584\u0565\u0580 \u0561\u057a\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0578\u0582 \u0563\u0578\u0580\u056e\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0565\u0576 \u0568\u0576\u0564\u0578\u0582\u0576\u057e\u0561\u056e \u0570\u0561\u057d\u0561\u0580\u0561\u056f\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u056b\u0576\u057d\u057f\u056b\u057f\u0578\u0582\u057f\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b\u0581 \u0578\u0582 \u056f\u0561\u057c\u0578\u0582\u0581\u057e\u0561\u056e\u0584\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b\u0581 \u0564\u0578\u0582\u0580\u057d: \"\u0546\u0561\u056d\u0561\u0576\u0577\u0565\u0576\u0584 \u0531\u057a\u0561\u0563\u0561\u0576\" (#Spot The Future) \u056e\u0580\u0561\u0563\u056b\u0580\u0568 \u056f\u0578\u0579\u057e\u0561\u056e \u0567 \u0574\u056b\u0561\u057e\u0578\u0580\u0565\u056c\u0578\u0582 \u0570\u056b\u0574\u0576\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0564\u0565\u0580\u0561\u056f\u0561\u057f\u0561\u0580\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b\u0576, \u0570\u0561\u0584\u0565\u0580\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b\u0576, \u057d\u0578\u0581\u056b\u0561\u056c\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0576\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0580\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b\u0576 \u0587 \u0561\u0575\u056c\u0578\u0581` \u056b\u0580\u0565\u0576\u0581 \u0570\u0561\u057e\u0561\u057d\u0561\u0580\u0561\u056f\u056b\u0581\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b \u0570\u0565\u057f: \u0531\u056f\u0576\u0570\u0561\u0575\u057f \u0567, \u0578\u0580 \u0569\u0565 \u0561\u0577\u056d\u0561\u0580\u0570\u056b \u0570\u0565\u057c\u0561\u057e\u0578\u0580 \u056f\u0565\u057f\u0565\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0563\u057f\u0576\u057e\u0578\u0572, \u0569\u0565 \u0574\u0565\u0580 \u0570\u0561\u0580\u0587\u0561\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0561\u0574\u0562 \u0562\u0576\u0561\u056f\u057e\u0578\u0572 \u0574\u0561\u0580\u0564\u056f\u0561\u0576\u0581\u056b\u0581 \u0577\u0561\u057f\u0565\u0580\u0568, \u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0563\u0578\u0582\u0581\u0565 \u0570\u0561\u0576\u0564\u056b\u057a\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0565\u0576\u0584 \u0561\u0574\u0565\u0576 \u0585\u0580, \u0562\u0561\u0575\u0581 \u0576\u0578\u0580\u0574\u0561\u056c \u0579\u0565\u0576\u0584 \u0573\u0561\u0576\u0561\u0579\u0578\u0582\u0574, \u0577\u0561\u057f \u0585\u056a\u057f\u057e\u0561\u056e \u0565\u0576 \u0578\u0582 \u057d\u057f\u0565\u0572\u056e\u0561\u0563\u0578\u0580\u056e: \u053b\u0576\u0579\u0576 \u0567 \u0574\u0565\u0566 \u056d\u0561\u0576\u0563\u0561\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0574\u056b\u0574\u0575\u0561\u0576\u0581\u056b\u0581 \u0570\u0576\u0561\u0580\u0561\u057e\u0578\u0580\u056b\u0576\u057d \u0577\u0561\u057f \u0562\u0561\u0576 \u057d\u0578\u057e\u0578\u0580\u0565\u056c \u0578\u0582 \u0574\u056b\u0574\u0575\u0561\u0576\u0581 \u0585\u0563\u0576\u0565\u056c` \u056b\u0576\u0579\u0578\u057e \u056f\u0561\u0580\u0578\u0572 \u0565\u0576\u0584? \u053f\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0561\u0581\u0565\u0584 \u0561\u057e\u0565\u056c\u056b\u0576 \u0561\u0575\u057d\u057f\u0565\u0572: /t/spot-the-future-making-a-living/561#sthash.tMzn3mfD.dpuf\n\nHere is the original text:\n\nA new world is being built by people working far outside the mainstream.

Introduction <a name=chap-1></a>\n\nThis document shows our process for adding images to our open source coffee beans dataset, which we use to train the decision algorithms of our optical coffee sorter.\n\nEveryone can create and contribute images, and all contributions are valuable because coffee beans differ wildly by variety and cultivation conditions. A smartphone with camera is enough to contribute. The image capture mode of our optical coffee sorter is more efficient (but the sorter is not yet finished, and not every contributor will have one).\n\n\n## 2. Capturing the images <a name=chap-2></a>\n\n## 3. Enhancing the images <a name=chap-3></a>\n\n* If you have pictures that are overexposed: use \"Colors \u2192 Levels\" and for channel \"Value\" map the visible part of the histogram (in logarithmic display mode) to target values \"0 \u2026 245\". For the source values, you can set the white point so it includes all white tones with high histogram values, mapping the even whiter ones (that occur rarely) to pure white this way.\n\n* If you have pictures that have a lot of stray light (\"whitewashed low contrast appearance\"): same as before, but map to 0 \u2026 255 since they do not have to appear visually darker overall.\n\n* If you have pictures that have the wrong light temperature setting: open the \"Colors \u2192 Levels\" dialog and use the \"grey point\" button to select a point on the white background. This will adjust the channel gamma values for each color channel differently so that the color of the selected pixel appears neutral gray.\n\n* Alternative if the pictures are overexposed: use the \"Colors \u2192 Auto \u2192 Normalize\" filter. If necessary use \"Brightness -30, Contrast +10\" after that.\n\n* If the pictures are underexposed: set \"Brightness +70, Contrast +20\". But often, pictures cannot be properly rescued in such cases.\n\n\n## 4. Splitting the images <a name=chap-4></a>\n\nThe Photo that you take of coffee beans is obviously collection of it; since that\u2019s not efficient and smart. So you take photo for collection of bad and good beans separately. Once you have finished taking photo, you might want to separate each of the beans from those photo.\n\nFollowing is the Steps/Procedures for splitting coffee beans:\n\n\n### 4.1. Renaming:<a name=chap-4-1></a>\n\n* Keep all good and bad images in separate folder. Example: Set01-good and Set01-bad\n* Rename each images. Example: Set01-good.01, Set01-bad.01, and soon.\n\n\n### 4.2. Install GIMP <a name=chap-4-2></a>\n\n\n### 4.3. Set up the export_paths_to_png.py script <a name=chap-4-3></a>\n\n* [Download this file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19JzJPO3Isd-turNsyrrO3ukgj2_OdIJY)\n* Paste downloaded file in \u201cC:\\Program Files\\GIMP 2\\lib\\gimp\\2.0\\plug-ins\u201d\n  \n\n### 4.4. Set up the set_paths_visibility.py script <a name=chap-4-4></a>\n\n* [Download this file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LjHMQeZrN8aSl0teAlhR-SOH5vxvqLh-)\n* Paste to the same location as you did in previous step.\n\n\n### 4.5. Configure keyboard shortcuts in GIMP to speed up this process <a name=chap-4-5></a>\n\n* Open GIMP [b]Edit[/b] \u2192 [b]Preferences[/b] \u2192 [b]Interface[/b]\n* Keyboard shortcut section  \u2192 [b]Configure Keyboard shortcut[/b]\n* Search for [b]Selection to path[/b] and [b]Set paths visibility[/b]\n* Click [b]once[/b] on disable of Selection to path not Selection to path(advance) and assign [b]E[/b] -->[b]Reassign Shortcut[/b]\n* Do same for Set paths visibility and assign [b]Ctrl + A[/b] \u2192 Click [b]Close[/b] \u2192 [b]Ok[/b]\n\n\n### 4.6. Create \"paths\" for individual coffee beans in an image <a name=chap-4-6></a>\n\n* Use the [b]rectangular selection[/b] tool and set its tool options to [b]Fixed: Size[/b]\n* Create a selection with one bean in its center.\n* Press [b]E[/b] to create a new path.\n* [b]Occasionally[/b] press [b]Ctrl + A[/b] to show the \"Set paths visibility\" dialog and use it to show all paths. So you can see which beans you did not yet \"process\".\n* Select one path in the [b]Paths[/b] dialog, press Return, rename it to a [b]two-digit number[/b] (01, 02, 03 etc.), press Return to confirm and an arrow to select the next one. This is the fastest way to work through the whole list to rename all.\n\n\n### 4.7. Use the export_paths_to_png.py script on an image of coffee beans to create 220\u00d7220 px images in PNG format of individual beans <a name=chap-4-7></a>\n\n* Select [b]Filter[/b] \u2192 [b]Paths[/b] \u2192 [b]Export paths to PNG[/b]\".\n* In the dialog, always select the [b]same output folder[/b] for the PNG export images of all source images.\n* In the dialog, select [b]Export Paths: All paths[/b].\n* In the dialog, set a [b]prefix Set01-good.01.[/b] (or whatever is the part of your source image filename before the [b].png[/b]).\n* Click \"OK\". The result will be files [b]Set01-good.01.01.png[/b], [b]Set01-good.01.02.png[/b] etc., for all your paths.\n* Also save the full image in GIMP's [b].xcf.bz2[/b] format, by choosing [b]File \u2192 Save as \u2026[/b] in GIMP. Example : [b]Set01.good.01.xcf.bz2[/b] for image [b]Set01.good.01.jpg[/b]\n\n\n### 4.8. Repeat the last two steps for all images of coffee beans for which the process has not yet been done <a name=chap-4-8></a>\n\n\n## 5.

There is\u00a0a similar\u00a0site called emotionalbaggagecheck.com, where you can either submit your thoughts anonymously or help someone who submitted a text by sharing a song and some kind words.\u00a0The platform I was thinking of was more an idea of improving the communication between affected people, so that there is a lower threshold of reaching out for support when you feel bad.\u00a0I was hoping to hear what experiences other people have had, what sort of stressors they struggle with\u00a0and how they handle this. This doesn't have to be a 'full-blown' mental illness, but any thing that has weighed on them emotionally.\u00a0\n\nThis was related to @NeleG post about how we are under so much pressure to function and to succeed, that we risk our emotional (and as a result, often also our physical)\u00a0well-being.

For the app to work, you need to secure a firm commitment of the authority in charge of fixing the street\u00a0<em>before\u00a0</em>you launch.</span>\n\nIn fact,<span> I recall an experience made by UNDP Montenegro that made exactly that mistake. They built the app, and initially people used it. But then, guess what: in Montenegro, responsibility for street maintenance lies with municipalities (in Italy, too). But municipalities have no money at all, they are stretched very thin. So, the sudden rise in expectations induced by the app put them through a lot of stress, and there was some conflict between the national authorities (who had helped UNDP in this) and the local ones (who found themselves saddled with the pressure and deprived of the resources to respond. It did not go well: they had to abandon the scheme, amidst citizen disenchantment. It turns out it is easier to build a mobile app than to change the balance of power between central and local government!</span>\n\nWhat is the situation like in Georgia?

If people are cooking for everyone, but have to take into account the changing dietary requirements of visitors and temporary guests how does that square? I can cook a huge variety of dishes that use meat, a handful of vegetarian dishes and maybe 2-3 vegan dishes.

My thoughts briefly on that topic:\n\nI love the idea of heaving someone in charge for the kitchen and food supply. We do this in our Wir bauen Zukunft project too. This person is responsible for checking what we need to buy, how many people are currently eating on site...I also believe it's important to check on for example what needs to be cooked each day, because it will get bad. For me I had difficulties with one thing: in the mornings everyone made breakfast for themselves. So the ones that ate first for example used up the bread and the ones eating later did not have any left. So for me this is very new, because even though there is no \"we all eat together\" rule in the mornings, I always look how many people are already awake and ask around who wants to eat. Then I also think about who might not have eaten, to make sure there is enough. Also I noticed in Sidi that there is not a big responsibility with the water issue. Meaning while I was there it was the same people getting water from the well. A kitchen manager could also check on that task and find different people to get water.\n\nIn general I liked the way dinner was prepared. It seemed organically to me. One thing I noticed is: the same people cooked together. There was no change in the group structure. But that's maybe because people like to cook with the people they want to spend time with anyways?\n\nOverall for me, a community short term or permanent needs a community manager or at least a kitchen manager, making sure that tasks regarding the kitchen for example keep running smoothly or at least keep running. It would also help to agree on a set of \"recommendations\" in the beginning. As for example what does \"a clean kitchen\" mean? If everyone has the same view and agrees on the same factor it is much easier to stick to those \"recommendations\". \n\nSo long! I would have loved to stay longer and be a part time community manager.

Unpreserved food is essentially free through gleaning and dumpster diving, and with a powerful preservation technology like this, a five year supply could be collected in one summer.

The small town dynamic that makes a mess of stewardship when it comes to notions of self-importance making Trolls key holders to what should be shared and open resources.\n\nBut back to the point, the Law in question is that feedback in human communication systems facilitates the natural function of consciousness which aligns with evolution in the generation of complex order as a means of dissipation. Those who get complexity theory and its beautiful corollaries in thermodynamics please shout!\u00a0\n\nThis means the more diversity among entities, the more entity-nodes on a system, the faster the rate of latency in communication, all of this amounts to an accelerated rate of order-generation in the subject of focus.\n\nTake for an example the strange result from the Australian medical preschool tests.

Scientifcally driven, but clear and accessible. -- Medium: a wiki, a blog, a video, an infographic, ...</li>\n\n<li>General outreach: A brief and general overview of diabetes and insuline, that describes the problems and solution. Here we could rely on metaphors, alternate non-scientific imagery and pop culture outcasts to paint a picture with layman's terms. The storytelling is strong in this one. -- Medium: a song, a meme stream, a video, an infographic, an app, ...</li>\n\n<li>Awereness: The aim here is for diabetes to reclaim the spotlight, without going into detail and without there being an obivous 'lesson'. This calls for a unique approach in terms of medium/execution and there has to be a synergy between the message and the medium as well. Ideally we can find a medium with which diabetes hasn't been presented yet.

They think that young people in MENA region could use a space to help each other boostrapping their lives and work. They were thinking about peer-to-peer support as an operations mode. They were thinking about social innovation as a space to expand into. In short, they were thinking about something that looks a lot like Edgeryders itself, or at least shares its key values.\n\nSo, they invited us to take part in a procurement process. The list of the entities invited to bid looked intimidating: NESTA, IDEO, MIT, Impact Hub Dubai and more. But we decided to give it shot, and we won. This is yet another step on our mission of connecting the edge of society with its center. It does not get much more central than the World Bank.\n\nSo. We will be working on this. effective immediately and up to February-March 2018. We cannot yet say much about it, as we need to iron out our executive plan first. But I can already say this: we are being ambitious. We are going for long-ranging, long lasting impact.\n\nWe are looking to connect with people with an interest in social innovation and peer-to-peer culture. We particularly welcome interest from residents of Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia.

It's being supported by Mask.fm.  Please check it out, let me know what thoughts you have, and if you have any suggestions for an episode.  Please email woodbinehealth@gmail.com.  Once we get capacity for Skype interviews, there are so many of your projects we'd like to highlight, so be ready :slight_smile:\n\nPodcast Description: \"This way of life is a war against our bodies. The air polluting our lungs, our breast milk filled with toxins, and our mental angst driving us to suicide. Proposed health cuts increase our general precarity in relation to a failing health system, a health system that fundamentally furthers our objectification and dependency on capital. Therefore the steps we make to gain and share skills and develop subterranean practices of care can return some of the agency we\u2019ve lost to the professionalization of medicine and the profitable mystery that is our bodies. As we think about expanding our capacity, we don\u2019t want to just \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d of public health infrastructure. We need to slowly break our dependence on these institutions in all the ways that we can and also look for ways to use them to our advantage. We think this happens through sharing knowledge and skills, an emphasis on preventative care, and finding ways to manipulate existing structures to allow us to move forward on this path of autonomy. We believe in the utter necessity of revolution, of the development of material lines of power. Questions of care and health autonomy are pivotal to that progression. From the Greek solidarity clinics to the Zapatistas \u201chealthcare from below\u201d to Black Panther Clinics and GynPunks, there is inspiration for this path all around us. We begin by finding each other. This podcast will be a step in that journey.\"\n\n[Health Autonomy at the End of Empire](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/health-autonomy/id1279639722?mt=2)  \n\n[Mask.fm](http://www.maskmagazine.com/the-rant-issue/work/introducing-maskfm)", "created_at": "2017-09-08 15:54:01.249854", "updated_at": "2018-11-22 21:31:15.651010", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 347, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 162.2, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3613, 3798], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87498, "user_id": 4096, "topic_id": 14918, "post_number": 1, "raw": "This is the space for coordination around [this call](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-7-1-2020).

Then, individual researchers can be asked to \"zoom in\" into issues they wish to bring to the attention of the reviewers. We need instructions in the form of:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>working titles of the presentations</li>\n\n<li>duration</li>\n\n<li>order in which they will be delivered.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nGuy was saying that it is not necessarily a good idea to organise the meeting by work package. This means giving some thought about how\u00a0<em>else</em>\u00a0to organise the presentation. One formula that I like is to look at outstanding issues, where we think we are making headway. In our case, we are proud of our engagement model and of the exciting methodological developments in ethnography + networks. The Monaco-Manzini-Hassoun-Salantiu paper might also be super-interesing, though I doubt it will anywhere closed to being finished. The data model is also an advancement with respecto to the state of the art.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-02-13 16:18:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:56.093865", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 247, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [31998], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37722, "user_id": 3595, "topic_id": 6670, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Congratulations for Zyara..I've already enjoyed few stories.

It was really clear to me once I started talking to people and from talking to Marina that, given the time we started, joining a mostly formed consortium was the only real viable option. \n\nCapacity is also definitely an issue. Even before getting sick, I didn't have the bandwidth to do the level of work I needed to do to get this together in the timeframe we had -- I had to put a lot on the backburner. If I shifted to working on Edgeryders full-time, this time commitment could be more viable, but I don't have that capacity only working part-time. This especially means that the \"this has to be done now\" kind of work is tough to do, which hammers home Marina's key point about starting early. \n\nAll that said, I generally enjoy grantwriting and if there's less time pressure, it's something I definitely see myself investing a lot of time in in the future. Expressing preferences from my end, I prefer to either reach out to people I already know/have some kind of connection to, even if we haven't met formally, or be looped in once someone else has made a connection to someone new --- cold calling/emailing is not something I enjoy (so Marina's conclusion about efficacy is a welcome one for me).

But then again, \"much earlier\" there is a lot of stuff on our plates, too: review meetings, other proposals to submit, some rest and holidays. Also, following the natural metabolic cycle of this scene also has some advantages. For example, we could attend the C-KIC networking event, which had like 300 people, instead of figuring out ways to reach similar numbers all on our lonesome. \n\nMaybe we could make this more viable by being proactive. I am thinking on an internal meeting on \"stuff that closes in the next 12 months\", where some promising calls are singled out by individual RezNet folks, who then start a slow burn. This internal meeting could even be a public event, which is what @nadia wanted to put at the center of the LinkedIn campaign (we ended up not doing that on my insistence. I was willing to compromise the amount of splash such an event would have made in return for speed, i.e. no need for a two-weeks lead to prepare it).\n\nBut that creates additional work, that of securing information a year in advance: for example, these calls opened in the period September 22nd-October 9th. We could have started in July, working on EU preparatory documents and betting on the texts of the calls being similar to those preparatory documents, but not much before.\n\nAnother solution is simply to slow down, waiting on people to get in touch with us instead of being so proactive.

It was @winnieponcelet, bless him, who pointed me towards people like [E.O. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson) and [Joseph Henrich](https://secretofoursuccess.fas.harvard.edu/).\n* Hence, the groups with the best apparatus for collaborating win. There are even speculation that humans are on the threshold of a major transition to becoming eusocial \u2013 the mammalian equivalent of ants. \n* So, we consciously push a culture of using (what we think is) the best protocol for human collaboration. Online is better than offline, because it saves bandwidth and every interaction is recorded and searchable. Asynchronous is better than synchronous, because it is more efficient \u2013 people pick up the interactions in their own time and according to their own interest. Self-selection is better than top-down selection, because people end up doing what they are best at and what they are most passionate about. Reliability and not dropping the ball on others is better than brilliance, because missing deadlines or going AWOL blocks the information flow. When people start working the way we like, we tend to stick to them \u2013 good people are so hard to come by. In this sense, yes, we are a tiny, embryonic phylum. \n* Like phyla in _The Diamond Age_, we are easy to join and leave, and we trade with people outside the phylum.

The students will research how local traditional practices have addressed these needs in the past. This approach will acknowledge the expertise and skills developed over generations while exploring how new technology and social innovation can improve or compliment traditional practices. This project will provide a way for young people to interact with elders in the village to learn more about local customs.

What we think might work is the part of it where people spend time interacting in an aligned way around a project, and they develop professionally (and often personally) as a result. But that is done best by a different technology than the incubator: the home. So we [set out to reinvent the home](/t/id/6239). It makes sense anyway, since we want to live in a space that suits our lives, and then started to test whether this new model [can also perform some of the functions of a business incubator](/t/id/6878). \n\nIn fact we have a prototype running right now, on the west coast of Morocco. I visited it in the early days, but now, from my base in Brussels it is not clear how well it is working. There are so many dimensions to it, from food preparation to interacting with local people (apparently discouraged by local authorities) to, of course, developing products for small businesses. Sometimes I think it's going great, sometimes I feel pessimistic. The [reports](/t/id/8273) from @hazem and @HadeerGhareeb seem on the positive side. What is sure is that we are far from having a smoothly running model. \n\nSo \u2026 what does _your_ project look like? What can we learn from you? Have you documented it anywhere?

I will give these more attention in the coming months.</p>\nGalGael, the organisation I work with, crossed something of a milestone this month. Since @markomanka suggested I write more about our work, I thought this would make an appropriate focus for this post. Not least because it\u2019s my observations within the context of my work with GalGael that led me to propose a theme for the Open Village festival - to explore what conditions generate health, and how this shapes our understanding of the role of citizens, policy and the state?\n\nA little over twenty years ago, GalGael received a letter from the tax man - recognising our charitable status. A week ago we held an event to celebrate all we\u2019d learned over the twenty years that have passed since then. Receiving a letter from the taxman, was something of an ironic landmark to celebrate as I\u2019ll explain. As the years have unfolded, we\u2019ve been more confident about sharing our unconventional beginnings. GalGael first constellated around a protest fire in a dark woodland on the edge of one of Glasgow\u2019s housing schemes - Pollok; the first of four such schemes in response to inner city slum conditions. It\u2019s an area that has been shaped by successive waves of regeneration policy, some that have recently been identified as contributing to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jun/10/glasgow-effect-die-young-high-risk-premature-death\">\u2018Glasgow effect\u2019</a> - Glaswegians\u2019 higher risk of premature death.</p>\n \n<p>While protesting a motorway that would cut off those in the \u2018scheme\u2019 from parkland, we learned much about how to create community in a difficult space. We had to learn how to create a place of relative safety in the midst of an area of \u2018excess morbidity\u2019. It was an exciting time; edgy and full of possibility. Videos uploaded to Youtube over the years capture some of that. We declared a Free State. We created our own passport, our own stamps, our own university.\n\n<i>Somehow the symbolic opened up so much possibility that wasn\u2019t there before. Looking back now, perhaps it was our co-creation of an alternative reality that revealed our normal mode of complicity with the set of assumptions and beliefs that comprise the dominant reality or socioeconomic structures of the present day.</i>\n<p>One of this month\u2019s conversations with Douglas Robertson, a sociology professor at Stirling University brought me to this quote from Bourdieu; \u201c<i>our denial, the source of social alchemy is, like magic, a collective undertaking\"</i>. Colin Macleod, my late husband, who spent much of his childhood in Pollok Park escaping the \u2018scheme\u2019, later described the Free State where he set up camp as an \u2018art installation\u2019 and a \u2018leading question\u2019.</p>\n<p>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/4x9-Wzzkp1w\n<p>\nDespite all this possibility, we lost the campaign and the motorway was built. But we had no wish to throw away all we\u2019d learned - often through excessive hardships. GalGael was our vehicle to continue working with those hard-won lessons and shift from being about what we didn\u2019t want to what we did want. There was a clear founding intention that this was <i>not</i> about establishing a charity but rather <i>reconvening peoplehood</i> - what it means to be a people. And that for me is why it\u2019s a little ironic that the landmark we celebrated constitutes our recognition as a charity. <i>Peoplehood</i> is fundamentally about relationship, identity and culture - all characteristics that institutions, not even charitable ones demonstrate particularly well (in my book at least). <p>\nThe problems of institutional responses is a thread I\u2019ve noticed running through a number of the conversations I\u2019ve engaged with these past four weeks. It\u2019s been a very live issue as I\u2019ve observed GalGael developing. There are certain pressures on an organisation as it matures to become \u2018mainstream\u2019 - often that\u2019s how we define success. The challenge I think we\u2019ve partly overcome is how an entity can sustain itself without becoming institutionalised. What Graham Leicester of International Futures Forum refers to in his book <a href=\"http://www.internationalfuturesforum.com/p/transformative-innovation-guide-to-practice-and-policy\">Transformative Innovation</a> as a \u2018creative integrity\u2019 seems to be a more useful description of GalGael as an organisation.\n</p>\n<b>Craft, relationship and conditions for health</b>\n<p>\nLiving in times when we have a myriad of products and services to meet every conceivable need, through GalGael we have witnessed that beyond this people have a greater need - to simply be \u2018needed\u2019 for who they are - to belong. I understand it as people who due to income deprivation cannot consume and acquire status also finding themselves dependent on institutions and statutory services to meet an ever increasing amount of their needs. No longer producing or serving our own needs and those of our families or neighbourhoods creates a devastating vacuum of meaning. This contributes to poor physical and mental health and a profound loss of self - far beyond the \u2018self confidence\u2019 prescribed for the workless by well-meaning professionals. It critically damages Antonovsky\u2019s <a href=\"http://pagepark.co.uk/news/feeling-good-wellbeing-the-built-environment\">sense of coherence </a>that is fundamental to health and that he defines as a person\u2019s situation being comprehensible, manageable and meaningful. My guess is this is an epidemic that stretches into the employed population too.</p>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7633ee97d7eefd5671f668b7f2e4dd860c4e9874.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n<p>So what does this tell us about the conditions that create health and wellbeing? For us in GalGael, in our workshop craft defines our relationships. It creates a purposeful workspace where you are not objectified as the \u2018service user\u2019 in need of help but an active agent - the focus becomes the object you\u2019re working on, often beautiful or useful, and new forms of identity get bound up in this act of creation. The sense of agency generated through the craft process is immensely important. Grayson Perry said: \u201ccraft is the physical manifestation of \u2018I can change the world\u2019\u201d The craft gestures themselves - chiseling, sawing, hammering - create new neural pathways, working with the brain\u2019s plasticity to erase negative past patterns. But it\u2019s also something about the immediacy of the experience; its embodied; its not abstract that is immensely important. And that you are engaged in producing something where you have a relationship to the end use in ways that is no longer so often the case in our global marketplaces. This is of course particularly true of the boats that slide from workshop to water for both literal and metaphorical journeys. Each stroke of the oar generates not only speed but agency, coherence and meaning as you inhabit the river that otherwise passed you by.</p>\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d3072d40060d6f0718d739a1eaf4ab90940e3310.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\">\n<p><b>Radical monopolies</p></b>Relating where this takes us to the theme of my fellowship - I see relationships as fundamental to creating the conditions for care and DIY welfare. The nature and scale of institutions make them inhospitable to the quality of relationship called for. @matteo described the problems this causes, as uncovered through the course of <a href=\"https://edgeryders.eu/t/enforcing-a-policy-collectively/786/7\">Open Rampette</a> - the detachment of legislators can lead to regulations that are hard to enforce because the lack of relationship leads to blindness in the legislation as to the realities of implementation. Quality of relationships also featured strongly in my conversations with <a href=\"http://www.anthonymccann.com/\">Anthony McCann</a> who describes himself as a \u2018thoughtful practitioner\u2019 - suggested by @dougald  as someone who has been exploring care for some time. Both Anthony and Marco spoke of the problems that have been generated by a welfare system based on a trauma care model. The efficiency of a \u201cconduit model of service\u201d works well for emergencies and disease. The problems arise when this displaces the home care or mutual and self care that used to be common place. Illich refers to this as \u2018radical monopoly\u2019 but it\u2019s also pervasive medicalisation of increasing areas of our health that becomes a problem, no longer the solution - in what Illich describes as the second watershed of modern times in his important book <a href=\"http://writingcities.com/2015/11/20/ivan-illichs-tr-conviviality/\">Tools for Conviviality</a>.</p>\n<p>So to bring this post to some sort of conclusion - quality of relationships are a condition for health. These relationships form the substructure of the architectures of love, to continue with that metaphor. I\u2019ll finish this post with a quote from Eduardo Galeano, the Uruguayan writer, which captures perfectly the kind of relationship that underpins our work at GalGael;</p>\n<p><i>\u201cI don't believe in charity. I believe in solidarity. Charity is so vertical. It goes from the top to the bottom. Solidarity is horizontal. It respects the other person. I have a lot to learn from other people.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>As a parting thought - this quote also captures the implicit power dynamic in our relationships and perhaps this is a further condition for DIY welfare in the context of OpenCare. Either way, I look forward to more insights and learning generated through being in relationship and conversation with others through the course of this fellowship.</p>", "created_at": "2017-08-03 12:59:11.719950", "updated_at": "2017-10-05 17:44:51.219744", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1683, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 628.6, "like_count": 6, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3769, 3622, 3362, 2754, 854, 200], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52864, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 9766, "post_number": 17, "raw": "Thank you very much for this discussion.

There are no production-level apps and I don't know how well it is all going to turn out, but in theory and prototyping it is looking fascinating. \n\nI think that there is a possibility of not needing to scale as much with self-hosting. Especially if we can bridge all of the different applications through the person using them. If it is as easy to create an application (or at least instance of an application) for three people as it is for 10 000 people then how large a scale would we need? \n\nOne aim with Holochain is to have small packets of composable code that can be used to create the local applications that are needed within a community. While there are probably going to be applications that span actors from all over the world, including knowledge sharing and bridge-building applications between networks, there is a possibility for an approach to network building that promotes smaller, evolvable applications that are run by a bunch of people that want to coordinate activities. Is there really a need for global scale applications? The one network? If not, what is the appropriate scale of a network? \n\nI am guessing that people will be bridging different networks and applications in the area of their interest and expertise.

It is a system to produce open source non-fiction books (which  is still way too rare and desperately needed) and built around the \"collective action\" idea. Like in pre-order type crowdfunding of innovative products, but specifically for content creation. In addition, it uses \"crowd contributions\" to actually produce the content.\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Users propose what non-fiction books should be written (title and table of contents).\n2. Users also offer to write certain parts of the books for a certain amount of crypto tokens (of the new kind created by Edgeryders).\n3. In typical crowdfunding style, users send crypto tokens  to  the proposals they want to become reality.\n4. If a certain amount of tokens has been reached within the campaign's time, the proposal is automatically accepted. Otherwise, contributors are sent their tokens back, also automatically.\n5. A system that includes peer review makes sure authors deliver quality work and receive their tokens in return. They can then cash out on an exchange, or contribute their tokens to a different campaign.\n6. The whole book content is published under an open content licence.\n\nAt first, this procedure is funded with our own crypto currency that has been airdropped into the Edgeryders community. Then, it should be simple for anyone else to get this currency, for example on the [Stellar Distributed Exchange](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/exchange.html). That, effectively, allows Edgeryders users to \"cash out\" their airdropped tokens if they do not want to use it to influence what content should be produced. Similarly, Edgeryders O\u00dc can also sell the tokens it did not airdrop on the open market this way (but slowly, over years, to not crash the exchange rate). Of course, with these tokens Edgeryders can also influence what content will be produced in a major way for the first several years.\n\nOnce all initial airdropped and retained tokens have been spent on content creation, the system should be running sustainably on its own, having achieved critical mass. At this stage, the system could also run with normal money, except that tokens will be less costly to send around and to manage with an automated software system. (However, the main reason to have tokens and not money stays the same: the proceeds from the initial sale allow to jumpstart the system and grow it to a scale that allows it to proceed on its own.)\n\nNote that this is not a direct solution to the problem of motivating people to contribute to the edgeryders.eu platform as it is \u2013 people presenting their projects and initiatives, giving and receiving feedback about their ideas, and organizing various entrepreneurial projects together. However, if it indeed works as a model for rewarding non-fiction authors, it surely will attract readers for the finished works, people proposing new works to create, and the discussions around both would happen on the edgeryders.eu platform.

But _Red Plenty_ does not build a world in which this system works. The 1990s real-life version also tanked, because it turned out that, if you ask people to state their willingness to pay for things, the results would be subject to all kinds of cognitive biases. For example, respondents would be willing to pay more to say a single seagull from poisoning after a tanker's oil spill, than they would to save the entire seagull species (real example). \n\nSo, the book is enjoyable, but its pathbreaking potential in economics is, in my view, small.", "created_at": "2018-06-20 16:40:46.749942", "updated_at": "2018-06-20 16:40:46.749942", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 209, "wiki": false, "reads": 33, "score": 46.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [45691], "is_liked_by": [4497], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52778, "user_id": 4897, "topic_id": 9766, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Good questions which makes me reflect on my post.

I think a look at the social structure of the Mosue, a matriarchal society in China, might be illuminating, although that society is being eaten by China's overbearing Han culture, or the Minankgabau in Indonesia. There are bits we can see in vanishing cultures which we, I think, will have to painfully re-create anew. Some people had great ideas along the way: Proudhon and mutualism; Henry George and the land tax; Major C. H. Douglas and Social Credit dividends for all from income from previously invented machinery -- all of which are represented in science fiction, which might fund government services. There is the stark warning from Orwell & Ayn Rand about the dangers of government overreach. I think it would speak to current social sicknesses if we could create small, more intimate, more supportive groupings than the huge impersonal societies we have fallen into. I detest the word \"greed\" -- it describes everything we all want, which only strong individuals can take: much better is to describe a society in which there is a place for every personality  type. It will come from human social evolution, not from social engineering, however well-meant. And it will not be soon.

Not really, because burnout is more about \"how\" we work, that \"how much\". So it's more nuanced than the work-life balance model. Burnout is not a problem of the individual but of the system, of the way we work, of how organisations are run (often bureaucratic, no matter if flat of top-down) and of the work culture itself. I have encountered people who take care of themselves but work in toxic work environments, and this includes activist groups or social change organisations. So self-care becomes a crutch to plough through. Burnout is often misunderstood because it's tackled at an individual level only, instead we need an approach that is both individual and systemic.

Go ahead and set up a post proposing a copy to be added to the <a href=\"/t/welcome/5345\">Community\u00a0base</a>\u00a0and edgeryders.eu admins\u00a0will do it.\u00a0\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\"><a name=\"Challenges\">Challenges and stories: the main collective intelligence vehicle</a></h2>\n\nAs we are spread all over the world, we meet and interact with Open Care community members here online, more than in any other settings. Publishing posts, reading each other and leaving comments to one another's contributions\u00a0is\u00a0how most of the interaction happens.\u00a0\n\nContent in OpenCare in shared in response to <em>challenges</em>. Challenges are assignments: we describe a problem (for example: what is your experience of giving and receiving care?) and ask the community to respond.\u00a0\n\nGood practice that you can adopt as much and\u00a0as often as possible:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Check the current <a href=\"/en/op3ncare/helping-one-another-to-discover-what-is\">Challenges and responses</a></li>\n\n<li>Submit your stories</li>\n\n<li>Leave thoughtful comments to other people's stories</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7a24bac52b42c68f2ed200b26a7dc3d532c4abab.PNG\" width=\"690\" height=\"449\">\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\"><a name=\"Story\">Submitting stories</a></h3>\n\nOnly users who have created <a href=\"/user/register\">an account</a> on Edgeryders and are logged in with their username and password\u00a0can submit stories.\n\nWhen submitting a story, the user is taken through a number of steps in order to clarify which challenge the story is answering, what personal question is the person trying to figure out, who would be an audience that they prefer, and what general topics they want to file the story under. The editing interface makes it possible to input text, links, to upload images or to embed video or audio files (using the HTML source).\n\nWhen users create a new piece of content, the other community members who have contributed previously in OpenCare will receive an email notification. Same is true when someone comments other stories.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\"><a name=\"Language\">Euro English as language </a></h3>\n\nFor a project with such a strong social networking element, it is absolutely essential that people can interact without mediation nor delay: having someone translate everything we post would be not only impossibly expensive: it would dampen interaction and feedback, making the Open\u00a0experience quite miserable. To get around this problem, we have agreed to encode some rules in the social bargain of Open Care.\n\nThese are:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>you are welcome to write in your own language. People can always get the gist of what you are writing by running it through Google Translate; however, we encourage you to write in Euro English, the lingua franca the majority of young Europeans use when they move about. I wrote Euro English, and I specifically don't mean the Queen's English: the former is an inclusive, connecting language that most youth speak enough to communicate, the latter is just another language, with its own solid grammar, pronunciation niceties and idiosyncrasies. There are many more people that speak Euro English, than people who speak the Queen's English.</li>\n\n<li>Community members agree to be tolerant of each other's grammar or spelling mistakes. No one is allowed to look down at anyone else for this. We are not stupid or under-educated, we are just writing in a foreign language. Our effort to communicate deserves respect.</li>\n\n<li>Community members who are native speakers of English are kindly requested to keep in mind they are part of a global community, and make their own effort to write in a simple, clear manner.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\"><a name=\"Anon\">Right to privacy and\u00a0anonymity </a></h3>\n\nGiven the sensitivity of a topic like care, we\u00a0are encouraging members to feel confortable writing online, but we are aware that this may not be the case for everyone. All our team members are aware of this setback and make it possible for people to submit materials or write their personal stories in two ways: 1) creating a user profile\u00a0which is not linked in any way to their real identity and uploading content from that account or 2) emailing stories and have one of the Open Care curators upload for them.\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\"><a name=\"Anon\">Research data </a></h3>\n\nAll written content submitted in the OpenCare online\u00a0spaces will be\u00a0aggregated, coded and analysed\u00a0by researchers\u00a0and in agreement with our Data Strategy. For details about the Open Care research, see our original proposal available <a href=\"/t/project/4861\">here</a>\u00a0(pp.18-19).\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\" style=\"\"><a name=\"Eng\">Other Online engagement tools and practices</a></h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"content-subsection\" style=\"\"><a name=\"Meetups\">Meetups</a></h3>\n\nMeetups are offline or offline\u00a0activities and events where community gets together.\u00a0OpenCare partners and members are encouraged to run OpenCare activities and announce them as Meetups on the Community Space. They can be as small as a presentation at an conference, or a community Meet and Greet.\u00a0\n\nPartners are already receiving invitations to tell about OpenCare in conferences, university lectures, hackathons etc. Our criterion for accepting or rejecting these invitations is their potential for engagement.\u00a0We do not recommend accepting last-minute invitations: allow\u00a0a minimum of two weeks lead time. This way,\u00a0all of us involved can spread the news that someone in our team is going to be presenting in venue X on day Y, and\u00a0reach out to others who might join you.\u00a0\n\nPlease post all your intended activities (online/offline, public meetings, conferences\u00a0etc)\u00a0as events in the Community space:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1.

They are\u00a0summaries\u00a0of what needs your attention\u00a0every 2\u00a0weeks, feeding in and out of the community calls.

For me the main reason to couchsurf/host was the exchange of ideas, knowledge and culture, so this project seemed to combine it all and I decided to meet up with Miganoush Magarian to find out more about it.</em>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/521a35aa6ff8bc31c544ab68109214afb6347a17.jpg\" width=\"654\" height=\"500\"><br><strong>How you got started and current situation</strong>\n\n\"The idea started at 2012 after I got the chance to attend \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.oneyoungworld.com/\">One Young World summit</a> which inspired me to set the goal to present a project on the stage of the summit next year. Me and my colleague Greta have a background in software engineering and decided to create this project as we always want to return to our community and try to inspire them and encourage them to reach something bigger and TeachSurfing would give a chance not only for expats going home but also for travelers to share their knowledge everywhere they go.\n\nI work at software enterprise company <a href=\"http://icn.sap.com/home.html\">SAP innovation center</a> in Potsdam Germany and when I told them about my project they agreed to \u00a0provide a team of 4 students \u00a0for developing TeachSurfing under the supervison of Gretta and myself. We basically pushed the company to collaborate and provide resources. A couple of months later, we had a prototype ready and then we started productizing it. SAP helped a lot to turn this project into a certified product. This was a part time project for me and then the manager agreed to give us a full year to proceed with the project.\n\nAfter we presented the project at One Young World Summit in 2013 we only had a landing page and got 300 base users from the summit itself which were in our network. Since then and now, the prototype has been iterated and successfully productized. TeachSurfing.org is now officially live and right now we are concentrating on <a href=\"http://armenia.teachsurfing.org/\">Teachsurfing Wave Armenia</a>, trying to find partner organisations to work with and if the model works here we will do the same for other countries too. We started TeachSurfing Wave Armenia since May 2015, and already now we have 9 local partners, 13 organization with their learning needs and most exciting we already have number of TeachSurfing success stories in Armenia, for instance a group of travelers from Germany, visited a village school in Armenia and led sport and team building exercise. you can read their story <a href=\"https://www.teachsurfing.org/#/stories/19\">here</a>.\n\nFrom April 2015 \u00a0- with agreement from SAP, \u00a0we decided to make it an independent social startup outside the company and we are working on our business plan and strategies now. Once we implement the business model/funding in Armenia, we would do the same for the other 95 countries that are already involved.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/8/846e3b61fe2050327b7caceb5f141da66c7dbbf5.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"345\"><br>\n\n<strong>Who's involved: \u00a0Who is in the team? Roles and responsibilities? Skillsets (what are individual team members good at?) Any partnerships?</strong>\n\n\"Right now there are a team of 10 motivated and international people:\u00a0\n\n<em>Co-founders based in Germany:</em><strong> </strong>Miganoush - responsible for TeachSurfing Armenia, software developer (back-end). Gretta - responsible for organizational and legal areas, software developer (front-end)\n\n<em>Team Armenia: </em>We got Armenoush who takes care of project coordination, Angela and Mariam who are the responsible of communications and Celina - designer (flyers, website, etc)\n\n<em>Team Germany:</em><strong> </strong>There are 3 more people in Germany - Marc business development and marketing responsible. Eva helping us with accounting and financial planning and Jose our expert web developer.\n\nWe also got Gaya in Sweden who has Armenian origin and takes care of funding applications. \"\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a11b770467920b6b8fc316dd5942db657596eafb.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"><br>\n\n<strong>Hypothesis guiding the work: \"I believe that to achieve x, we need to do y, through z\"</strong>\n\n\"Our plan is to find a business model to be sustainable. We are working on a solution for corporates, offering some knowledge-exchange services for their employee. Another solution - crowdfunding/donating. We are working on a benefit section on the website where people can donate money for the project - this works just like on Couchsurfing, travelers contact with local people and see non touristic places in the country offering a workshop or a session in return. \"\n\n<strong>What your main objectives are/why you do this?</strong>\n\n\"TeachSurfing serves 2 kinds of users: On the one hand, any business or tourist traveler can sign up and create a profile. Part of that profile is a listing of their skills - from languages, computers, marketing, and management to sports, cooking, singing, art anything that can be of value to others \u2013 and information on upcoming travel destinations and dates. Once completed, you can browse voluntary teaching opportunities at your travel destination or explore opportunities on the integrated map and plan your route around voluntary teaching possibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, representatives of schools, NGOs and communities can create an organization profile page and post their learning needs. Then, they can invite registered travelers with the desired skills to run workshops or courses. \u00a0\u200b\n\nTeachSurfing creates value for all users. By connecting with travelers, locals can expand their network and develop skills that will help them find jobs, or inspire them to continue their studies. In return, the travelers will gain a unique and deeper social and cultural experience through direct contact with local people.\u200b\n\nIt is easy to blame educational systems and governments for a country\u2019s educational problems. But we can all take action on an individual level today!\n\nAnother objective for Armenia is decentralizing the tourism - providing opportunities for travelers to go to non-touristic places. Everything is centered in Yerevan and people mostly visit the main touristic areas while most of the communities in remote areas never see a foreigner. We collaborate with<a href=\"http://www.idea.am/\"> IDeA (Initiatives for Development of Armenia) Foundation</a> which has several projects aimed at developing tourism in Armenia.\"\n\n<strong>What you enjoy about the work and what you enjoy less?</strong>\n\n\"I enjoy pushing the limits a little bit to have a bigger impact. Being a normal employee and trying to break this and do something more, working overtime,etc It all had a learning effect on me, even the worst situation taught me how to deal with the same kind of situation in a better way. In Armenia it feels like everybody tries to help which feels so good! We already have a big network and lots of positive feedback. Overall we are open to all kind of collaboration and it is amazing to meet new people every day.\n\nI do not enjoy bureaucracy, I am happy that my other team-mates \u00a0take care of it fortunately.\"\n\n<strong>What kinds of tasks do you do on a regular basis? Yearly, monthly, weekly, daily</strong>\n\n\"Daily - Technical stuff, website, meetings with partners, network, planning how to target, strategy, content and design, everyone is new except her and Greta so that the rest of the team gets the message right.Currently I am focused on the project in Armenia and Gretta takes care of everything else.\n\nMonthly - Applying for funding, at the moment we need some donors - European fundings, private funding, e.g. for Armenia we applied for Galust Gyulbenkian foundation. Fortunately they trusted me as a person as we are not registered yet and have no legal status.\n\nWe also have monthly discussions with the team to evaluate which direction we want to go and to make sure we are on the same page.\"\n\n<strong>What, other than money, do you think could help you in your work?</strong>\n\n\"We are currently looking for an office space, most probably <a href=\"http://yerevan.impacthub.net/\">Impact Hub</a> as it has a great \u00a0networks. Networks of other start ups could be very helpful for us to motivate and learn from each other. We also need partners who would provide us space for our events.\n\nThere is a huge brain-drain from Armenia, so I think if companies would provide their space for TeachSurfing events and open their doors to the public, lots of local participants would come and maybe they would be attracted to stay and work here instead of looking for a job abroad. We want to attract the local talents for local companies. We are also looking for gift partners and donors - we can\u2019t provide money but we can give gifts - printer, projector as a prize for TeachSurfing success stories.\n\nWe already have agreements with ARMIX, Microsoft, etc, and we want to partner with IT companies that could provide us with second hand equipment like printers, etc. We can not pay to our collaborators for providing space but we could provide them with the equipment they need instead. Lots of schools need IT equipment and it does not necessarily need to be brand new.\n\nThe biggest help we need is spreading the word about the project and visibility in order to have more members and ambassadors. Our perspective is to have everybody know what is TeachSurfing as an alternative possibility for travellers just like AirBnB or Couchsurfing.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4855bc1b18e29d9fd8c52beffafa58f55b48cf90.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"407\"><br>\n\n<strong>What help could you offer others and under which conditions (assuming no money is involved)?</strong>\n\n\"We plan to give visibility to our ambassadors and offer them training possibilities in leadership, management, etc to build our ambassadors ground and keep the people helping us to have an impact motivated.\n\nAs we have an existing network of 980 TeachSsurfers from 95 countries, we can offer connections and networks all over the world. \"\n\n<strong>Technologies or processes used?</strong>\n\n\"We use Bitirx24 - collaboration tool, Google Drive. We also got Amazon Web Services (AWS) sponsoring the infrastructure of the website. They offered their services for 2 years.\"\n\n<strong>Costs: What expenses are involved? Who benefits from the work? Who currently supports it, how and why?</strong>\n\n\"AWS Activate program will cover the infrastructure costs of our website for the next 2 years. What we pay for is:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\t\tCommunication costs - recruiting the hosts and TeachSurfers.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tSoftware developer - website, adding new features, etc. We constantly need to upgrade the website as it has Facebook and other tools integrated and if they change something and we don\u2019t, our website would not work properly.</li>\n\n<li>\t\tAccounting, tax consulting and resource costs. \"</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Existing alternatives: Who else is doing similar or relevant work/offering similar things- locally and or elsewhere?</strong>\n\nThere are lots of volunteer matching platforms(mostly based in US, less common in Europe) but they all require payments for organisation and the projects are normally long term but if one is professional and is not flexible with the time, then it will not work. We made a research and found 10 projects - 8 of them based in US. One in Germany. All of them provide donation and volunteer matching platform. What differentiate us is that we focus on offering flexible and free knowledge donation instead of money donation or long-term volunteering work.\n\n<strong>Important players affecting the work? (locally and internationally)\u00a0</strong>\n\n\"Personal connections and network. <a href=\"http://mitost.org/\">Mitost</a> NGO that supports Eastern European projects(they supported Miganoush to write the first application and connected her with their NGOs). One Young World - Miganoush is an ambassador and they provide a large international network.\n\nSocial Impact Lab - Where Miganoush and Gretta got a scholarship offering them office space, access to expert mentors and coaches in Germany.\n\nLocal network partners - <a href=\"http://teachforarmenia.org\">Teach For Armenia</a>, <a href=\"http://ecolab-program.net/\">Eco Lab</a>, <a href=\"http://yerevan.impacthub.net/\">Impact Hub</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kolba.am/\">Kolba Lab</a>, <a href=\"http://www.idhr.am/\">IDHR</a>,<a href=\"http://www.idea.am/en/\"> IDeA Foundation.</a> - they offer outreach to network of NGOs, schools, volunteers, and experts.\n\nIT sector partners - UITE.org, Microsoft Innovation Center - they are our network/venue/gift partners\n\n<strong>Long term perspective: any Business or sustainability plan?</strong>\n\n\"We want to include donations as a way of contributing on the website.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bc25037d380330bab561e5024072450de20d1c5b.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nRegulation and policy affecting this?\n\n\"We found out that in order to collaborate with the educational system in Armenia schools need an approval from the Ministry of Education. We know we need an official letter and we need a special authorisation to start collaborating with the school staff, hope we can get it easily.\"\n\nWhat does the concept of pooling resources mean to you?\n\n\"Nothing will happen without a network.

The first option is the GrEEK campus <a href=\"http://thegreekcampus.com/\">http://thegreekcampus.com/</a>\u00a0(I recommend this place because it's pretty awesome)\n\nThis is going to be Egypt's first technological and innovation park! It was the old American Univeristy in Cairo campus, and now it's being turned into a huuuuuuge co-working space for tech-enabled start ups, SMEs and companies. We had a visit there last week, and the place is amazing. They are going to offer many services like co-working spaces, innovation lab, office space a space for arts, dance etc and even a rock-climbing wall. They hosted a very big youth entrepreneurship event there a few months ago called Rise Up (<a href=\"http://riseupsummit.com/\">http://riseupsummit.com/</a>) and they're renting out some areas for lots of activities. It's all about youth for youth, and they absolutely love it! Also, it's in downtown cairo, the heart of the city \u00a0:)\n\nSome parts of the campus are still under construction, but they are capable of having events there. I checked out some rooms for the workshop and I took some pictures (eventhough they're still not complete I was assured everything will be ready by the 1st of April, they're working very fast)!! I think the innovators would be very relaxed and comfortable there because it's a very dynamic place for those innovators. Here is a link to a 360 virtual tour \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.360daleel.com/embed/theGreekCampus/\">http://www.360daleel.com/embed/theGreekCampus/</a>\n\n2. Another option is ICE Cairo, a smaller-scale innovation hub for youth!\u00a0<a href=\"http://icecairo.com/what-is-icecairo.php\">http://icecairo.com/what-is-icecairo.php</a>\n\nThey also have a really cool co-working space for young innovators, and it's location is also in downtown! The only drawback, however, is that the place is much smaller and I think it can take a capacity of up to 30 people only, I need to check with them!! We can see the availability there too!\n\nIf you guys have any suggestions or questions let me knoww!\n\nLooking forward to your feedback :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-21 21:27:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:13.719187", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 413, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61303, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11041, "post_number": 9, "raw": "In case your need some data sets for the event I found nice repository of  Data for Environmental Intelligence: A mega list of Earth System Datasets covering earth observations, climate, water, forests, biodiversity, ecology, protected areas, natural hazards, marine and the tracking of UN's Sustainable Development Goals \n\nhttps://github.com/rockita/Environmental_Intelligence", "created_at": "2019-10-14 10:27:21.986914", "updated_at": "2019-10-14 10:27:21.986914", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 53, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 47.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 2346], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22352, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4365, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>The network effect</b>\n\nMersi <a href=\"/u/roxana_rugina\">@Roxana_Rugina</a>!\n\nAs it happens <a href=\"/u/ruxandra\">@Ruxandra</a>\u00a0is already on Edgeryders and shared <a href=\"/t/we-are-all-together-working-slowly-but-surely-for-a-new-paradigm-we-just-need-vision-patience-perseverance-and-collaboration/4125\">her story</a> of Babele a while ago, plus the two of us are working already on another project.

I keep running into difficulties with either the neo4j-graphql-js library or neo4j itself when I write my own cypher queries.\n\nFor example, neo4j-graphql-js automatically generates mutations to add/remove relationships defined with the @relation directive in the schema, but I had to swap out the @relation directives for the more raw @cypher directive since the @relation directive doesn't allow us to filter soft-deleted nodes. That meant I had to write my own queries for updating relationships.\n\nSince I've had to skip the neo4j-graphql-js library and write my own queries in many places, I've also started running into problems when those queries don't return every related node that the frontend might have asked for in the posted graphql query. For example, I might have a mutation that adds a Responsibility as a dependency to a node. The qraphql mutation returns the node and the responsibility. In graphql, I might want to also return the nodeId for the Need that the Relationship fulfills. That's easy enough to define in the graphql mutation, but it means that when I write the cypher query for that mutation in the backend I have to make sure to fetch the FULFILLS relationship for the Responsibility. Now what if I also want to fetch the guide and realizer for the Responsibility, etc, etc. It quickly gets complicated.\n\nI think we'll need to refactor the backend and write our own resolvers (and do away with the neo4j-graphql-js library) as we continue to expand the graphql schema. That way we can set everything up so that a graphql query like the one above automatically fires off several, simple cypher queries that puzzle together the requested data. That's easy enough to do with the graphql js library on the backend if we do away with neo4j-graphql-js. Maybe it's also possible to do something similar while reusing stuff from neo4j-graphql-js, but we'd have to research that a bit. The library is still very new, so there might be undocumented features. \n\nSorry for the dense paragraphs, but I wanted to capture this here while it was still fresh in my mind. \n\n**Next steps:**  \n\nI'll start documenting everything in the README files to make it easier for people to contribute to the project. I'm also considering if I should spend an hour or two to add the ability for users to set the \"name\" property for their own user in the database. Right now people who sign up are only identified by their email, although everything is built to work if a Person's \"name\" is set. What do you think @hugi?

A datacoop is a way to share and process business data. Datacoops are useful to charities, cooperatives and other socially oriented orgs to do business intelligence in a way that allows them to compete on an equal footing with private business. It is an alternative to open data, perceived as bad because they would turn over business intelligence to private sector companies.\n\n<strong>Pain point</strong>: people in the social sector in the UK don't get digital. Many even hate digital, perceived as a polar opposite to \"helping people\" even if it helps them to do their job better and faster.\n\nProjectification:\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n\n<thead>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Activity</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Skillset</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Who has it?</th>\n\n</tr>\n\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>Getting buy-in from the decision makers in cooperatives</td>\n\n<td>That breaks down into the three subactivities coming next:</td>\n\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><em>Demonstrating a case</em></td>\n\n<td>Following a charity using data awareness to improve what they do.

The director that was appointed without any attention being paid to community oversight was Patrick. While all of this was going on, Matthias was in Nepal.\n\nI dug through the historical records that i still have access to, and, none of the information about this issue has been re-instated.\n\nThis wasn't a \"rocky start\", but something that took place after it had been running for a few years.\n\nThe fact that this is still unacknowledged, and hidden, means that all of the talk about transparency, and, responsibility towards the community, is still untrue, as this has never been resolved.\n\nIt also means that, should a similar situation come about, then the people involved could behave in the same manner, which will mean that they could fuck over the community members, and then deny it took place, just like last time.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nI'm posting this as a warning.\n\nYou and every other community member needs to watch your back.\n\nIf they had been open about this, had admitted their errors, and made reparations, then i wouldn't have to write this, as it would be part of the historical record of how people in an organisation screwed up, and then fixed things.\n\nSince this has not been done, and, they are still in denial about the problem, then they are making sure that this can happen again, and again.\n\nOne housing co-operative that i was a member of, 25 years ago, had a slightly different problem, but used a very different approach towards resolving it. The Chairperson, and the Vice-Chairperson, disppeared to India with 90% of the co-op's funds. Some of the members put a large amount of effort into cleaning up the mess that was left behind, documented how this fraud had taken place, and, changed the co-ops constitution &amp; policies, to make sure that this form of fraud could not happen again. This co-operative is still running 45 years after it started.\n\nThis was a complete contrast towards the way that the EdgerydersLBG company were, and still are, doing things.\n\nIf you are comfortable with the situation as it stands, then there's no problem.\n\nIf you, and the other community members, did not know that this had taken place, then there is a problem, as the lesson has not been learned, and the potential for fraud will continue to exist.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-07-17 08:47:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:04.183361", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 468, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 13.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [33460], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 3066, "user_id": 1880, "topic_id": 3033, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\u00a0\n\n<span>Firstly, I would like to express my personal admiration and pride for the devoted and enthusiastic work that each of you has done and is doing for commonwealth and better changes in our societies, because the atmosphere of mutual assistance and compassion is the main guarantee for the change. And this is what Edgeryders do.</span>\n\nHaving the apportunity to work and participate in the events organized by the UNDP and Edgeryders Team in <span>Armenia</span>, I came to a very optimistic conclution, that everything is possible if there are interested people involved in. <span>Particularly, the meeting and cooperation of different journalists, civic activists, innovators, students and entrepreneurs, the flow of their ideas and suggestions, as well as the crowdsourcing methods of singling out the most current social problems in<span> Armenia</span> delighted me. This gave us an opportunity to listen to each other, to understand the issues, to segregate the resources and the needs and to make some sketeches for future actions. So the first important step has been accomplished.</span>\n\nThis was actually another great experience for me to work with a group of talented people, to enlarge my knowledge about <span>Armenia's</span> current problems and situation, to find new faces and contacts, as well as to learn new ways of engaging others in the processes. I am impatiently waiting for new meetings and actions.\n\n<span><span>What I like about Edgeryders is their transparency</span> <span>and the linkage of different societies in their work. I mean, when dealing with a problem you have different similar examples in front of you, and you can follow the challanges that other societies also face, it gives you better/deeper understanding of the situation and much more confidence in your future actions.</span> What I'm expecting from Edgeryders is their continuous devotion and desire to work together and to expand their fields of activities</span>. <span><span>To engage more people in the events and to organize more face-to-face meetings.</span> I am also eager to have some cooperative undertakings and projects with <span>Georgia</span>, <span>Egypt</span> and other countires engaged, which will definitely give more effectiveness and attraction for future participants. Maybe kind of \u00abKnowledge exchange meetings\u00bb or traditional \u00abseminars for futurespotters\u00bb, held regularly, they will be meetings of consultation and reporting.

There are quite some doers out there that will not be happy campaigning for governments or EU institutions to take steps, and prefer to actually get in and build things, even on a small scale. \n\nIt seems to me that *local, but deep* deployments could be a nice addition to EU policies in this direction.

Right now there are zero incentives for adjusting electricity demand to available renewable electricity supply. Electricity prices can go negative at times on wholesale markets (happens in Germany when there's a lot of sun and wind at the same time). But consumers always pay the same per kWh. And so there is no demand for products that control loads based on the supply of electricity \u2013 and also, no such products are on offer, and I think not even technical standards exist for this yet. Instead what we have is offer management: large photovoltaics plants are required to throttle down when the grid receives too much electricity input, and there are standards for this kind of artificial scarcity.\n\nHowever, if one town or city would decide, as one of the local deep deployments you propose, to invest into a cooperatively owned photovoltaics plant, actual electricity consumption will be free as long as consumption stays within the limits of the available power. And for that, there would be a new kind of device that is added to a dishwasher, washing machine, charger for an electrical car or even a deep freezer (within more tight limits) and communicates with the grid and the user to schedule operation according to both the available renewable energy supply and user demand.", "created_at": "2019-07-11 11:21:56.648696", "updated_at": "2019-07-11 14:38:02.709462", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 300, "wiki": false, "reads": 18, "score": 48.6, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [56511], "is_liked_by": [1856, 4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5490, "user_id": 2481, "topic_id": 5457, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Local staff of opencare (Comune di Milano and WeMake) meets some parents of boys and girls with different abilities.\u00a0The presentation will take place @ WeMake (Via Stefanardo da Vimercate 27/5 in Milan - MM1 Gorla) on 30 march 2016. h. 4.00 pm\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/af05e6f47a6a1e7f350e9fa2de8d3864d0906b73.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\">\n\n", "created_at": "2016-03-24 16:48:59", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 08:27:25.105862", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 68, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37691, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 7344, "post_number": 4, "raw": "@markomanka you are looking at it.

We have been talking about autonomy in a health care context mostly influenced by <a href=\"http://digg.com/2016/amish-medicine-mosaic\">this article</a> about the Amish and their community-based approach to health care. The article is striking on many levels. They use the word \"autonomy\" in the sense of \"a state of\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0having to be coupled with the world at large in a way we find troubling.\" Some people in Edgeryders uphold a similar concept, dependency reduction.\n\nIts implications are manifold (I have made a short summary <a href=\"/t/a-challenge-on-autonomy-in-care/5636\">here</a>, but I would recommend reading the whole article if you have not done it already). But basically, it comes down to emphasizing prevention. Illness is not only bad for the individual, it is a burden for the community. You don't want that, so you try to take responsibility for your health. You adopt a healthy lifestyle: you still might get sick, but at least you'll have down your best, and you will know that the community knows. This is close to your own attitude, if I understand this right.\n\nWhich brings me to a question: wellness, exercise, nutrition\u00a0are the low hanging fruit, the place where you are likely to get most results per unit of effort. Why not stick to them? Why struggle with licenses and regulatory hurdles?\n\nAnd again: you mention sustainability, and well you should. Are your <em>present</em> activities sustainable? Or are they bleeding out money?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-11 17:00:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:53.944269", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 288, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 6.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 84916, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 9517, "post_number": 20, "raw": "We now have no less than five SSNA datasets available live.

The event has grown in scale and scope as IoT sinks more into everyday life. For the 2017 edition, there were 58 events across the globe, ranging from people in a bar talking about the changes that they see in their daily work, to panels and seminars and professional workshops. The purpose of IoT Day is to get an organic, local public debate going, resulting in larger groups of diverse people asking what kind of society they want. For the 2018 edition, Council will team up with the IoT Consortium ([iofthings.org](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8090451/iofthings.org)). Starting this fall, using the [iotday.org](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8090451/iotday.org)/ events link, you can upload events for 9 April 2018.\n\n\nCouncil is a timely ecosystem.

Both the Ashram Kitchen (link above) and the Jungle books use people from the camps to organise (cook, clean, serve, staff etc) their operations. Some parts of it a situated in specific areas of the camp and the people who live close to those amenities operate as security and safety overnight.\n\nIt's very much a case that the residents are very active on site. Whenever organisations start to build additional shelters, or do maintenance/repairs the locals get heavily involved. At the moment we aren't allowed to bring large-scale building material onto\u00a0the site so resourceful communities and individuals are doing a lot of self building using scavenged wood and tarpualin/waterproof fabrics. There are lots of skilled people on the camps, some of them have been engineers, large scale construction workers so us volunteers are always happy to bring equipment, hand it out and then stand back and let the professionals handle the work.\n\nIt is probably true to say that there aren't any refugee-led projects on site, or if there are, i am not aware of them yet. It's certainly something i could find out more about by asking around.\n\nMy view is that most people living on the camp consider it to be a temporary pit stop before they get to the UK (even if it's 'temporary' for 9 months or more) and so aren't\u00a0keen on setting up services long term on the camp when they could be in a lorry tomorrow night\u00a0heading to Britain. Longer term residents who are more settled in the camp and are looked at as community leaders do a lot more than i am aware of, but in order to find out more about what they were doing to support each other it would be really benefitial to have a few translators who could have more detailled conversations with them.

One could pre-organise a series of questions that you want to answer and post them in a digital space so that whilst the discussion happens people can aso engage online to think of answers.

Je vous invite de nous joindre comme \u00e7a et nous tous trouverons une fa\u00e7on de se comprendre._\n\nIn short, **Racines work across accountability, emancipation and solidarity to promote culture as an influential factor in human, social and economic development.** With cultural practices as their central focus and means, they work transversally across **anthropology, cultural policy advocacy, participatory democracy, education and economic development**. Actions take the form of **debate, advocacy (copyright, access to information, freedom of expression), research, trainings/forums/conferences, cultural events and urban interventions.** Partnering with the likes of cultural and political organisations, UNESCO, the European Commission, SouthMed CV and more, they have an impressive suite of initiatives across diverse communities and fields in Morocco, Africa and the Arab region. \n\nThere a few specific opportunities for collaboration that I\u2019m seeing right now, and some introductions/ other conversations that may seed further potential.\n\n## Cultural statistics and participatory democracy\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5e48d1ecf97f3edf762848ab6b89346b556d797f.JPG\" width=\"690\" height=\"517\">\n\nAs a part of their advocacy and cultural heritage work, Racines have done **fieldwork and surveying to map cultural practices and organisations** across Morocco. They have a comprehensive **repository of various statistics** - such as usage of new technologies and the internet - and an [artmap](http://www.artmap.ma/). This is coupled with their projects in **access to information and training in civil rights, processes and democracy** - such as their urban theatre interventions and comics to inform citizens of their rights. I think it could be really interesting to explore bringing **our aligned approaches in sensemaking towards citizen empowerment, solidarity and policy change** here. More specifically, how EDGE approaches to collective intelligence, social semantic network analysis and dense networks could be leveraged in this work. Mehdi, I spoke about this at our meeting where most simply it could look like collaboratively hosting an online forum on edgeryders.eu (such as [opencare](https://edgeryders.eu/c/opencare)) to induce dialogue, debate, knowledge sharing that is then analysed via our methodology in ethnography and network science and produces quali-quantative statistics from community members themselves (the methodology has been very well received by the European Commission\u2019s DGCNECT and most recently effective in policy change with our partners at the City of Milan.). This collaboration would unfold through the OpenVillage project I also spoke of - a self-sustaining R&D ecosystem for next generation social innovation and political renewal - currently focused on a network of autonomous physical spaces for innovation and political renewal linked through a powerful online community. So we could combine quali-quantative stats gathering with debate, P2P training and shared resources (such as your existing co-working space and our [Academy for the engaged citizen](http://academy.edgeryders.eu/)). Some food for thought for now and let's discuss when we next meet...  Ping @alberto @nadia @hugi @matteo_uguzzoni  \n\n## Culture is the Solution/ MARSAD\n\nRacines focus most of their work in Morocco but have begun to collaborate across the MENA region most recently on the **\u201c[Culture est la solution](https://www.facebook.com/LaCultureEstLaSolution/)\u201d initiative, a diagnosis of the cultural sector in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Lebanon.** Led by Racines under a partnership framework MARSAD (Mediterranean Action and Research for Sustainability and Development), the project assembles expert research with storytelling, testimonies and example projects. As above, it seems there is great potential in incorporating online dialogue, knowledge sharing and collaborative sensemaking towards societal change in the next evolutions of this MARSAD partnership.\n\n## FRIDA on the EDGE\n\nThe clear standout for initial partnership is the [FRIDA on the EDGE project](https://edgeryders.eu/t/frida-on-the-edge-holistic-security-focus/8304). Indeed it was @nadiael from FRIDA that introduced Mehdi and I and all of us are intererested in collaborating around the Moroccan prototype planned for the summer/ fall. Dialogue around this will continue separately on the FRIDA on the EDGE thread.\n\nShout out to @alex_levene and @natalia_skoczylas  and who may find Racines\u2019 [SpeakArt](http://www.racines.ma/node/1750) project of interest (I'll bring the CD and book to the retreat). And also to @noemi @matteo_uguzzoni regarding the FADAE project, a manifesto on public space in Morocco (on your desk and locatable [here](http://www.racines.ma/node/1263)). \n\nI\u2019ll also be connecting Mehdi with you @bob based on alignment around cultural capitals/ change and Alberto Alemanno / the Good Lobby team around lobbying.\n\nAnd so yes, although hugely inspiring, I won\u2019t cover all Racines' work here but rather have touched on some initial points of intersection that are generating ideas around collaboration. Mehdi gave me a bunch of resources that I\u2019ve brought back to The Reef Brussels and have left out, so feel free to dive in there or on [their website](http://www.racines.ma/) if you want to know more.

I have 2 caveats to add to the idea:\n\nAny space created by Edgeryders must interlock with the people already on the ground in those areas. If we are seen as 'fly by night', get out when it gets too difficult, then are we really any different to the Multinational corporation? My gut is that we know we are, but to the local person in that town/city we are the same.\n\nFollowing on from that:\n\nWhilst having a highly mobile, responsive component to the Reef should be seen as a priority and a core section of the structure i believe we need to come together around an existing permanent structure. There are 2 reasons for this. 1. An existing structure will be likely to have access to core amenities (water, sanitation, electric) Whilst the aim may be to divest ourselves of these needs, or create alternative sources for them in the short to medium term access will make transition smoother and more accessible. 2. Legacy. If we do need to move on from the space we leave behind us a core structure that can continue to do some of the work, if only in the hands of the remaining local supporters.\u00a0\n\nIf we look to the Monastery model as the concept then i think we need to think about the importance that permanence and physical structure played in the ability to become central to their communities. There will always need to be the wandering monk, but there must also be the fixed point. The relationship is symbiotic.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-12-21 15:56:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:35.766040", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 277, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44545, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 8567, "post_number": 2, "raw": "I read this when @matthias first shared it.

I recently became involved in the executive staff of our university (Bordeaux, where I've been appointed as vice-president for \"digital transformation\", that's how people like to call it here).\n\nMy post aims at identifying potential partners willing to deploy the SSNA methodology on a set of selected European university campus, in order to help our community get together and design the future of our institutions. I see lots of initiatives being taken to reform how universities work, how students may design their curriculum, how students may engage ... It is actually quite hard to make sure that directions taken are good, and even harder to get feedback from community members as those processes are designed or deployed.\n\nUsing the ER method would in a sense equip an institution such as a university with more acute ears to listen and hear what community think, want and certainly are already doing. One difficulty (at least here in Bordeaux) is our institution gathers about 60000 people: 50000 students, 6000 personnel and 4000 researchers (who also teach) -- that can be seen as a challenge in itself for the ER/SSNA methodology (!).\n\nI figured other universities must be following the same type of initiatives, facing the same type of difficulties/challenges.\n\nHow about turning this into a research problem, putting up a H2020 consortium where universities are entities being observed (and others -- maybe the same -- are research partners)?

At these times, it is useful to have an experienced tutor at hand who can assist with equipment or provide assistance at the time when an obstacle is encountered.\n\nSituated learning is most useful with regards to more vocational subjects (arts), or subjects with a large vocational component (sciences, engineering).\n\nThe secondary useful part of synchronous contact is in the lecture environment.

I'm close to my field of study, which is the dispersed community living in a rural area in Poland. It\u2019s rather a case study than a general theory on how to introduce the people to rural areas. \n\n**In this area there is a lot of new immigration from the cities** - from Warsaw, Wroclaw, and from different countries, not only from Poland, because the land for the past years was quite cheap to buy. **There was this fashion/trend to have an old stylish house in the rural areas. It goes also with the food sovereignty movement and trying to keep the quality of food in this area,** and preserving the traditional ways of cultivating the land and keeping the seeds, creating a food bank for them.\n\nEven though it\u2019s called a cooperative, the community has very diverse activities, also cultural ones.\nThe group is very fluent, it depends what the initiator of the activity is: for example - someone working with seeds gets help with harvesting by other people. We have maybe 10 active people who initiate activities like this, managing the cooperative to not lose the contact with farmers..\n\nIn the session about [bringing back human potential to rural areas](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-we-are-learning-about-re-ruralisation-food-is-only-part-of-the-story/15000/), there was one question about **how do you convince people about the rural alternative.** \n\nI can say how \u2018I convinced\u2019 - you cannot do much, there is a mix of factors which attracts people. In this case, in my region, a lot of base work was made by cultural organisations, the first ones which landed here, and even after the collapse of communism 30 years ago. They were looking for an alternative to the official culture, and they found an old railway station and were stubborn to renovate it. They also created the Laboratory of Social Eco Village, very small in the beginning and very unwelcome by the local community. Then slowly, by organising bigger festivals, by making living in the village trendy, they showed different ways of understanding the village. They attracted a lot of artists that are currently living here, and people who would go to the festival as volunteers, and were the kind of escapists looking for a meaning in living. This gave a nice vision of the future, to have a community nearby.\n\nI am also part of the researchers of this organisation: they have a lot of declarations of ecostyle, but it\u2019s more hippie culture, not ecological in a strict sense. As they started to attract people, there was a snowball effect, and a lot of people interested in the ecological movement were looking for land, so now it\u2019s a mix. We organised two local sovereignty forums which were dedicated to making a lively community around seeds, and local farmers - there aren\u2019t a lot of them left in the countryside. \nWhat attracts people is an already settled group and a good marketing of this group: if you come, you don\u2019t have to feel like a total outsider, with a lot of gossip around them as new settlers. We still have a cliche idea about new settlers, that are not part of the ethos. Before, it was Germany, and after the II world war there was a complete replacement of the existing population with newcomers from very different parts of Poland, as well as from the present-day areas of Ukraine and Belarus, which had previously been Polish and had a largely traditional Polish population. This resulted in the loss of the local identity to a large extent, the circumstances required to find oneself in a difficult climate, completely different from the previous one. **So this place is absorbent like a sponge when it comes to new cultural trends.** \n\nSumming up, it\u2019s a particular case, but I think it is important to have the leader group (not a person) that is updated with the local law; and permaculture which is gaining popularity are important. We also have good local government here. The person who landed in the hippie festival is now a mayor of the town. It\u2019s like a happy ending, he\u2019s organising open circle forums and attracting new settlers to do something active here, by facilitating cooperation with local institutions..", "created_at": "2020-12-02 15:24:17.739562", "updated_at": "2020-12-02 15:34:59.951776", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 770, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 537.0, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670, 8, 3, 2915, 3206], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44707, "user_id": 4068, "topic_id": 8581, "post_number": 8, "raw": "The fruiting is triggered by the blue box, Pleurotus loves blue light ;)", "created_at": "2018-05-13 14:34:16.791726", "updated_at": "2018-05-13 14:34:16.791726", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 12, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 86.8, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4349, 3362, 2095], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22596, "user_id": 104, "topic_id": 5459, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Video script</b>\n\nIs there a possibility of voice over?

In the last week I have worked on network reduction. The (social) interaction networks of SSNA projects are usually small and low-density enough that visual inspection reveals a lot about them. This, for example is the joint interaction network of both POPREBEL (yellow) and NGI Forward:\n\n![two_studies_network|690x414](upload://9lKKyu1mluqEXA3PcnLUN0IunJo.jpeg) \n\nThe human eye can immediately make sense of it. Notice how neatly they resolve into the two subnetworks, while the respective communities are still in contact via the people who participate in both discussions (gray nodes). This is a nice result in itself, wonder if @melancon and @brenoust have some comment to make!   \n\nThe situation is different for the codes co-occurrence networks. These are very dense by construction: if a single post is annotated with 20 codes, it gives rise to a 20-clique between all these codes. This means adding `20 x 19 / 2 = 190` edges. And it is just one post! This is why, in Graphryder, we need a good filtering utility. Traditionally, we filter by count of co-occurrencies. This is fairly effective... but really, the effectiveness depends on the intensity and style of coding. The more annotations there are, and the more coherent the ontology of codes (which reduces the number of nodes via merge), the denser the graphs become.\n\n![image|690x273, 75%](upload://kd9Xp3UlKLyyHWeJLCfh7eY2MHb.png) \n\nFor OpenCare (project 1), discarding edges with `k=1` already reduces the edges by almost 80%. But for NGI Forward, with a tighter coding practice, that reduction is less than 50%. \n\nReduction is effective for low values of `k`, then it tends to plateau. Nodes decrease slower than edges, and there are differences across projects. A visual representation of this:\n\n![net_reduction|690x348, 75%](upload://bRuxVlKdO1qKRpc43xamAKNIitI.png) \n\nDensity (number of edges divided by number of nodes) also decreases. Guy has a paper somewhere arguing that humans process best networks with density lower than 4. \n\n![net_reduction_density|690x350, 75%](upload://2oZSAmeAGARZcmiJoq788cDBN6y.png) \n\nSo, I decided to explore a different reduction technique. The reduction implemented in Graphryder, based on `k`, is a sort \"one post one vote\" mechanism. Given an edge `e`, `k(e)` is the number of post associating the codes connected to each other by `e`. Now, let `kp(e)` be the number of *authors* of the posts that have made that association. What would reduction based on `kp(e)` look like? And what does it mean?\n\nWhat it means is \"one person one vote\". Suppose Alice has authored one post where `code1` and `code2` both co-occur. Suppose Bob has authored another one. Call `e` the edge `code1, code2`. Now \n\n```\nk(e) = 2\nkp(e) = 2\n```\nNow suppose Alice believes `code1` and `code2` to be really important, and deeply connected. She writes five more posts where she makes the same  association. Now\n\n```\nk(e) = 6\nkp(e) = 2\n```\nAlice only gets one vote on `e`. Additional posts by her will not further change `kp(e)`. The only way that `kp(e)` can go up is if someone else, say Chris, writes a post that also associates `code1` and `code2`. From a social theory perspective, the main disadvantage of this method is that it loses the information about how important the connection is in the world view of each individual contributor. \n\nHowever, there are merits in the special case of a reduction by dropping all edges where `kp(e) = 1` . In this case, any connection that has been brought up by a single participant in the corpus disappears as a one-off, even if it resurfaces in several contributions of that participant. This seems to be consistent with the way we think about \"collective intelligence\".\n\nSince, by definition, `kp(e) <= k(e)`, reducing the network based on the values of the former is more effective than on the basis of the value of the latter. Now, for all three projects, 90% of the edges are discarded just by moving `kp` from 1 to 2.\n\n![image|690x225, 75%](upload://bC96A2xsrCKmdbh7KLC4bWcdfXq.png) \n\nDensity also drops faster:\n\n![omov_net_reduction|372x357, 75%](upload://2QElJWmbmVLOzf9O2YgxMXeVjhu.png) \n\n![omov_net_reduction_density|368x357, 75%](upload://3n0belMPd13DBSt7BdaL9bM2KRP.png) \n\nIt is worth noting that the correlation between `k(e)`  and `kp(e)`is positive, but weaker than I expected: less than 0.3 for our whole dataset. This means that the two reduction methods emphasize (in part) different connections. Below, you can admire the codes co-occurrence networks of POPREBEL, already filtered by `kp(e) > 1`. Redder edges denote higher number of co-occurrences. In case you are wondering, that bright red cluster contains `healthcare`,  `low quality`, `medical treatment`, `Prague` etc.\n\n![ngi_kp>1_red_to_k|690x441](upload://fQChaM03jOUw1CS4Yv7tT8eH5Fg.jpeg) \n\nHere is what happens if we color-code for `kp(e)`:\n\n![ngi_kp>1_red_to_kp|690x441](upload://pUHkthML0bB2nMjkC2wK6YuwQFe.jpeg) \n\nQuite a difference! The bright constellation at the center links codes like `Law and Justice Party`, `big cities`, `inadequate income`, `social benefits`, and `low quality of the health care system`.\n\nIn general, as so often in data science, there is no \"best\" (Dutch \"allerbeste\") method. The preferred reduction method depends on what you are interested in. \n\n@amelia, @jan, @Richard, @Jirka_Kocian, @Leonie, @katejsim, @Wolha: I would welcome your thoughts on how well \"one post one vote\" and \"one person one vote\" mesh with the ethnographer's research ethos. \n\nThe good news is that I have already implemented the code to compute `kp(e)` when stacking the codes co-occurrence network. :-)", "created_at": "2020-12-08 15:39:43.310308", "updated_at": "2020-12-08 17:48:07.468411", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 927, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 222.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3323, 4022], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24073, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2321, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Great idea</b>\n\nI really like this idea.

And there is the more fundamental reason that money as a \"token of value accepted by a multitude of parties\" is inherently a social construction and needs social governance to be successful, and that often fails, both in states and in grassroots projects.\n\nSo what we did to support economic exchange in [PayCoupons](https://pay.coupons) is to switch from money to mutual credit notes. In a way, everyone there issues their own currency and we solve the problem of \"but how does everyone get what they want\" with an algorithm for multi-party bartering that we made.\n\nI remember we looked into Holochain, Bancor, Stellar etc. but so far, there is just no distributed ledger technology that could run PayCoupons in a privacy-protecting way. The mathematics for running our algorithm in that manner are just not there yet. So we have to stick with a centralized or federated platform architecture for now (and it shows that distributed ledgers have some limitations left, but it will be figured out).\n\nWhen it comes to actual use of any new value accounting or exchange system, the experience we made is this: it's a challenge to hide away all the tech complexity from the end user, but without that there will be no mainstream adoption.", "created_at": "2019-04-24 10:51:59.106222", "updated_at": "2019-04-24 10:51:59.106222", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 285, "wiki": false, "reads": 34, "score": 16.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [52772], "is_reply_to": [52772, 52773], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 44718, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 8603, "post_number": 2, "raw": "The sheet will probably have bumps on it.
