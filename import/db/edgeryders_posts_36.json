Edgeryders itself is an attempt at partial packetization: we are looking at the very big, very entangled problem of the transition of youth to an independent active life. We split up the observation part in discrete packets, the quanta of experience brought by each Edgeryder with each mission and each comment. But in the end, someone needs to do a synthesis, and that someone needs to go through all of the materials on the platform and aggregate them. I am afraid this will have to be done in the old-fashioned, hard way. So collaboration in Edgeryders is packetizable (relatively easy) at the observation level, but not at the synthesis level.\n\nAnyway, I am very proud of the subtitles to the Edgeryders video.

That's a really thoughtful piece of writing, thanks for sharing. I checked most of your links, and I understand something but not all. Here's what I do understand: there is no overarching reason for money to be a scalar. In fact, in David Graeber's book on debt I found many examples of societies and communities that use more than one form of money: a currency for buying potatoes, another one for thanking your wife's clan for bringing her into the world and letting you actually marry her. Graeber is an anthropologist, and claims that a lot of currencies have been used to rearrange the relationships between human beings not as a byproduct, but as their core functionality. His arguments seem solid to me.\u00a0\n\nThis opens up a way into design currencies; in the digital age it makes sense that such design currencies become reputation indices computed from a stream of acts that lives on some server. So far so good. The next level of your piece is a reflection of what money really is, why is it that we use the same word (\"currency\") for something we use to \u00a0acquire potatoes and something we use to acquire a family. This level of abstraction is beyond me, for the moment.\n\nI would be really interested in the empirical part of this story. I know people are experimenting with local or community currencies, like the famous Wir in Switzerland. A friend of mine, a VC, has just invested in a company that hosts a currency called <a href=\"http://www.sardex.net/\">sardex</a>\u00a0(yes, they are from Sardinia). You probably know a lot about these things. So I have two questions.\u00a0\n\nOne is about these people. How many are them? What are they doing? How are their currencies faring? Which projects are considered successes?\n\nThe other one is about yourself. You and your crowd have obviously spent a lot of time thinking deeply about this stuff.

It's interesting to see things from the perspective that's more \"inside\".

I think very few people, sometimes myself included, have any idea what the work actually entails...what constraints people are working under.\u00a0\n\n<blockquote>\u00a0 <span>It is increasingly difficult for a group of people (politicians and technicians) have the capacity to carry out positive policies for the public to whom they are accountable.</span>\n\n</blockquote>What does this mean, and how do I recognise it ? why is it increasingly difficult? And \"why can't they just fix it\" ? IIt would be so helpful to have politicians and civil servants really tell their stories, about their rydes and their work. Perhaps then the sheer scale of the issues becomes tangible to people who aren't on the inside of institutions.\n\nAlso, I ask myself what it would take to get a culture of cooperation and collaboration to solve major issues going. I notice that in my contexts, the drive towards sharing- information, resources, skills- comes naturally. But that is often because there is little percieved competition for funding etc. So how do you/ we/ they create the incentives so that behaviors of people within institutions works with, not against good initiatives?

However, it has not defined a common European OpenData license which should by applicable to all European Public Administrations.\n\nThe creation of a single public information re-use space in Europe requires much more, it requires a common European OpenData license applicable to all data generated by European public administrations.\n\nThis is possible. Royal Decree 1495/2011, approved by the Government of Spain, provides an example of how a simple legal notice serves as an open data license applicable in the public sector \u2013 this sets an easy to follow roadmap for implementation in Europe.\n\nFirst, define a European OpenData license compatible with the principles of information re-use without further conditions.\n\nSecond, set a transitional period after which the license is associated with all information generated by the public sector in the European Union.\n\nThird, provide for the compulsory publication of such license in all public administration websites giving legal certainty to all European infomediary entrepreneurs and citizens wishing to make use of the information.\n\nRight now the European Commission and Member States are developing the new directive, it is time that WE the OpenData community get our voice heard in Europe.

Primo tra tutti: nessun essere umano \u00e8 illegale. Con tutta l'avversione per gli slogan, questo \u00e8 prezioso.\n\nInfine, tante amicizie si sono sviluppate a partire dalla nostra scuola, e persino degli amori, un matrimonio tra un'insegnante e uno studente che ha dato vita a una bimba che sta nascendo in questi giorni.\n\nMa per tante storie felici ce ne sono altre terribili: amici arrestati e internati nei centri di detenzione solo perch\u00e9 senza un permesso di soggiorno o con un permesso scaduto... altri espulsi... altri impazziti dalla depressione nonostante tutti i nostri sforzi.\n\nMa l'esperienza resta comunque meravigliosa.

Definitely exciting news! How many unofficial cohousing neighborhoods are there?\n\nComing from the US and working at the Cohousing Company in California, I find that the cohousing concept is usually unfamiliar territory for most people stateside. It is definitely an old idea, originating in 1960's Denmark. Charles Durrett and Kathryn McCamant, the principals of our office, brought this concept to the US, even coining the term cohousing, almost 3 decades ago. Still, it's a housing option that usually requires explanation, clarification, and destigmatization. It's not a commune, personal space is still honored, and you get your very own private home still. What differentiates cohousing from typical housing options is that the private home is located within a physically and socially supportive neighborhood, which can facilitate sustainable habits for healthier people and a healthier earth.\n\nCohousing should be a more accessible option; it's long overdue. For more info check out the third edition of Creating Cohousing: Building Sustainable Communities, by Chuck and Katie. Also, check out our website for info on past and current projects.\n\nhttp://www.newsociety.com/books/c/creating-cohousing\n\nhttp://www.cohousingco.com\n\nI look forward to seeing the Milan neighborhood come together.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-02 19:30:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:14.338040", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 223, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18074, "user_id": 760, "topic_id": 1367, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>Some background and comments</b>\n\nDear Noemi,\n\nthank you for your comment and for pointing out Giacomo's report.\u00a0\n\nI am close to being done with school as well, and while I do find the bureaucratic aspects of university pretty frustrating, I have to say I am satisfied with most of my coursework and professor. \u00a0I study in Italy as well and I have been exposed to the american system during an exchange. I agree with Giacomo that theirs can be a lot more engaging, but I think that experience helped me see the advantages of our \"methods\" \u00a0and I am satisfied of the choices I made so far. \u00a0\n\nHowever, having some meaningful work experience before graduation feels much harder here than it would have been in the US, and even if you do manage to get an intership you it's likely you are going to have meaningless tasks. That's why I find personally and from the experience of other friends that volunteering for a non-profit you can get more exerience and responsabilities by doing something meaningful. I think we badly need some framework allowing students to do exactly this instead of intership, and a general recogniction that this kind of experience can be valuable.\n\nMoving on to languages, we are not so lucky in our country. Even english is still a challenge for some, and high shcool programs offering two second languages are disappering, with the exception of the \"language high school\" track.

As the old man in this corner of the Edgeryders community, I feel it is my duty to say that the vast majority of people lived in rented dwellings up until the 1980s (in most European countries but not in America). The idea of mass ownership of homes was, according to historians, Thatcher's: she wanted more people to be ideologically tied in with the haves, or something to that effect. Apparently, her administration thought\u00a0 that a society of home owners would be more invested (literally) in the status quo. They turned out to be mostly right.\n\nAnyway, my point is that before that time people did have families, and they did not feel particularly flaky, quite the contrary. So I would submit that the perceived stability of a familial arrangement has little to do with home ownership. Maybe an important factor is, rather, the rigidity of the agreement that binds it members together: practically indestructible in the case of parent-to-offspring, solid but less committal in\u00a0 that of sibling-to-sibling, more instable in that of life partner-to-life partner, and even more in that of the housemate-to-housemate.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-13 11:52:09", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:47.678510", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 210, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11006], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23384, "user_id": 120, "topic_id": 1405, "post_number": 16, "raw": "Hey!

After some test driving of the space, I decided to get the minimum membership: that meant I was on the mailing list, I got invited to all the events, I had access to the hosts and I had a right to actually work from there for 10 hours a month - the minimum quantum of time you could buy.\n\nI did this in part because I enjoyed so much my home office. The other part is that I felt that, outside of events, the networking benefits of being present in the space were really not that great: most people who spent a lot of time there (with exceptions) were more junior than myself, very happy that they had met a nurturing environment where their vision of social innovation would not be treated with contempt. But there is a difficult balance to strike there. Everybody wants to hang out with people who are a little more senior than oneself - that's where the benefits of networking are. If the more established members see that the space caters mostly to people who are just starting, they will be inclined to drop out, therefore reducing the networking value also for the junior members!\u00a0 So, the hosts are constantly struggling to retain the more expert members and keep a balance between juniors and seniors, while it's mostly juniors that want to come in! An additional problem is that, if someone's startup or whatever makes a breakthrough, that person needs much more space and has to move out of the coworking... and the community loses a very precious member.\n\nI went through your sketches on the Facebook page.

One no longer wants to be engulfed by the perpetual agitation of the outside world.\n\nThe <u>intuitive</u> mode is the fourth level.

You must learn to trust your ability to get to fully know yourself. Confirmation that inner world is good.\n\nThe <u>creative</u> mode is the fifth level. Achievement in life is based on inspiration, the development of artistic or scientific creativity, and passion of discovery. You keep inventing new goals, new concepts, and to discover new facts. This creativity seems to spring from nowhere - the unknown simply generates new thoughts. It is the inspiration. Amazed by the beauty and complexity of life.\n\nThe <u>visionary</u> mode is the sixth level.

I have worked for the Royal Armouries Museum in the UK for the past five years (and, should HM Government approve my visa and allow me back into the country, I will continue to do so). Even before that, my work as a swordsman on the Renaissance Faire circuit was literally how I made my living during those summers. I also sang at many of these events (a faire performer is expected to be a bit of a jack-of-all-trades).\n\nHow it has been 'good' for me is quite a deep question, really. Have you ever read 'The Book of Five Rings' by Miyamoto Musashi? He was a swordsman in 17th century Japan who's expertise made him one of the few people in Japan to bear the title <em>kensei</em> (sword saint). In addition to being one of the best manuals of swordplay to have ever been written, it can also be read metaphorically, strategies of combat being used as allegories for ways of navigating adversity in life: the 'Way of the Sword'.\n\nThis is what I have taken away from my time as a swordsman.

On which basis do you want to become linked in the community</em>?\u201d When Gilda Farrell created the Edgeryders project, this is the aim she had in mind. (see <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/2011/10/meet-team-gilda-farrell/\">Meet the team: Gilda</a>)\n\nI have more confidence in this model of collaboration between a government and its citizens, since it allows to really align governments projects and policies on the deepest aspirations of the population.\n\nCitizens often feel disconnected, or disengaged, about what the governement is proposing. Participatory budgeting <span><span>could be</span> <span>a source</span> <span>of division and</span> <span>conflict, if the</span> <span>budgets</span> <span>that are proposed</span> <span>do not correspond to</span> <span>projects or</span> <span>directions</span> aligning with<span> the</span> <span>aspirations of citizens</span><span>.</span></span>\n\nFor instance, there has been many cuts in budgets, <span><span>but if</span> <span>these </span><span>cuts put an end to </span> <span>agencies</span> <span>struggling to</span> <span>maintain</span> <span>world peace</span><span>,</span> <span>or </span><span>diminish</span> <span>efforts</span> <span>to lower the level</span> <span>of</span> <span>greenhouse</span> <span>gases</span> <span>prioduced within the country</span><span>,</span> <span>these</span> <span>budget</span> <span>cuts</span> <span>may not</span> <span>be accepted by</span> <span>citizens</span><span>.</span></span> <span><span>Participation</span> <span>and collaboration</span> <span>will then turn into</span> <span>confrontation</span><span>,</span> <span>and policy makers</span> <span>will find</span> <span>the exercise very</span> <span>difficult to handle</span><span>,</span> <span>and citizens will </span><span>not</span> <span>enjoy</span> <span>their experience</span><span>.</span> <span>Everyone</span> <span>will lose</span><span>.</span></span>\n\nI believe that what lies beyond, and behind, the participatory budgeting, is crucial, and should be more explored by governments. So far, most of the intiatives have been about 'what do you think about this specific bill or thing that we are doing?', instead of asking what the citizens would like to see happen.

Each project has a short description a video and associated networks (i.e Twitter, Github, etc). \n\nWhat I want to be able to create is a sort of widget, that principally has a link to where the project is posted on EdgeRyders, potentially a project page of it's own on the site, a simple link could suffice but ideally I'd like it if we could automate (with RSS or JSON) links related to the conversation around the project - which updates automatically. \n\nSo my first question, what sort of support do we currently have for RSS or JSON feeds, and what could I do to help with this. More generally it would be really great if going forward people could put a kind of EdgeRyder badge on their own website (similar to the twitter one: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines - so to create multiple portals/points of entry for the platform. \n\nLet me know your thoughts! \n\nB", "created_at": "2014-03-02 17:59:36", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 05:48:26.079825", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 208, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12764, "user_id": 52, "topic_id": 1480, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>the key point</b>\n\nDear Carlien, thank you so much for your answer.\n\n\"<em>I think that one of the pitfalls of quantifiying social value is that we will establish a different kind of measurement but will not redesign the decision making proces iself\"</em>\n\nI totally agree with you. This is the key point!\n\nI think that we need more participation on two different levels:\n\nmore citizen participation in decision making processes and more participation of policy makers in the evaluation of events such as occupations or other events that come from the bottom.\n\nAnd this takes time and dialogue.\n\nIn this case I mean that before deciding to evict a space the Administration should give time to the project to evolve, if a project has been clearly presented. The Administration should observe how the district and the whole city react and it should dialogue with the occupants because they are the most direct interlocutors, they are the problem that is looking for a solution.\n\nOn the other hand, citizens (workers in the cultural sector in this case), should participate in process of decision making about the allocation of funds and about the destination of public spaces. (And internet is a perfect tool) Because if the citizens have this kind of reactions it means that the Administration have made some \u200b\u200bmistakes in the allocation of funding and destination of spaces\n\nSo I think you need time to evaluate and dialogue. Also to understand what kind of support given when the project is worthwhile, because in this period of crisis the support may not only be financial, but could be a support also sharing of tools, means of production and skills, like support to write business plan, consulence to get to European funds or to dialogue with the highest levels of the institutions. The support can also be mapping of unused buildings and understand with citizens what they could become .\n\nevaluating in this horizontally, transversal, accurate, participated way discourages who want to occupy without good reasons or good projects , but it is a credit and expands the perspectives of who have done something illegal, but that is absolutely legitimate for the social value produced.\n\nwhat do you think about?\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-10 19:19:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:12.545376", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 386, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11481], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23552, "user_id": 102, "topic_id": 1479, "post_number": 7, "raw": "I have a real love/hate relationship with Facebook.

She could diagnose easy cases of flu - even better, validate people's self-diagnosis \"Phew, I think I'm catching the flu\". She could be connected to other people like her elsewhere, who she could turn to for expert advice.

That would make consciousness a part of a cybernetic hardware/software system, and would mean that experimental psychology etc. has much to say for informing spirituality.

I drew an (unclear/unspecific) image from my online experience that got much clearer and much sharper after an offline experience - meeting in person with Noemi. I view this gap as an opportunity to contribute to the EdgeRyders online community some ideas from my experience with design.\n\nFollowing the meeting with Noemi I began thinking about (and compiled a document of) questions (with some temporary answers of my own) that may form a foundation for a design process. I would like to give these questions to the wider EdgeRyder community, but this requires some preparation. I believe it is important to first share why these questions need to be asked before actually asking them. Which brings me to this session proposal (thank you Noemi for providing the structure).\n\nI would like to suggest a\u00a0<strong>30 minute session</strong>\u00a0to share some ideas about design (hint: beyond graphics, beyond screens, beyond user experience). OK, another hint ... have a look at the session title again. I believe that design is first and foremost an inquiry of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.yogastudies.org/sanskrit/dharma/\" target=\"_blank\">dharma</a>\u00a0- a precious opportunity to identify and connect with purpose. When you want to create something (for example a website), having a clear sense of the purpose of that thing can be very helpful. It may sound obvious and/or far-fetched (funny how such extremes can coincide), but I believe it can have very practical implications.\u00a0\n\nThat would be followed by a\u00a0<strong>1 hour session</strong>\u00a0in which I would be happy to facilitate a discussion during which we could begin a process of EdgeRyders design. I will bring my list of questions as a starting point and together we could review those questions, ask new ones, suggest answers, hear different views ... and maybe co-create a new view/approach to our community effort of creating an online EdgeRyders presence.\n\nThough much of this session will be aimed at EdgeRyders' online presence, it will, (by design!), touch the heart of EdgeRyders itself.<strong> It is the purpose of EdgeRyders that connects the website, the business model, customers, projects, community ... everything.</strong> A wonderful thing about EdgeRyders is that purpose is abundantly available. We need to put a bright light on it and find tools and techniques that will keep us attentive to it as we continue our journey.\n\nI have an additional secondary wish/agenda in this proposal. I believe open-source development suffers from a systemic flaw when it comes to design. Most people speak of user-experience, but I believe that flawed user-experience is a symptom of something deeper (and that trying to fix user-experience without going deeper is a flawed effort). I have been on the sidelines of open source for some years now, occasionally attempting to contribute through my design skills (not much luck so far). I believe that if we can find a way to introduce practical and relevant design into our own community, that in doing so we may be able to provide something valuable to other open-source / community efforts.\u00a0\n\nIf you are interested in this and wish to come more informed and better prepared I recommend this inspiring and fun to read book:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672326140/\" target=\"_blank\">The Inmates Are Running the Asylum</a>\n\nSession Requirements\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A writing-board with colored pens to write on may be useful.</li>\n\n<li>A computer + web browser + internet connectivity + projector setup may be useful.</li>\n\n<li>Writing tools (pen and paper) for participants may be useful (bring your own!s?)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Update (original post left unedited) Sep 18th:</strong>\n\n<u>Structure</u>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>I'd like to leave the first session early in the event as already planned: 30 minutes introducing ideas + 60 minutes workshop. Hopefully this will leave us all thinking and wanting to say more ... and so</li>\n\n<li>I'd like to add a second 2 hour session later in the event where we can let ideas flow and try to move in an actionable direction.

However I doubt if the idea of translators for that, when taken literally, would help. It's not that we don't understand each others words, it's that our mindsets are mutually foreign and the room to bridge that gap has been missing so far.\n\nA one-and-half hour debate like the MTPM session is not the space to reach mutual understanding, of course. But it can be learned of course, if both sides are open to it. It just needs way more time. Like (crazy idea ahead) sending a group of 10 or so Edgeryders to be in kind of a co-working space with the EU parliamentarians. They should just get a small room of their own and an info&amp;meeting booth right in the EU parliament, permanently. They would draw all kinds of ideas and input from the web community, and get questions from parliamentarians discussed there ... after some months, if we're successful to understand and communicate well and happen to be \"liked\", the policy maker people might stop by frequently to get inspired, discuss a policy issue with the grassroots people, and experience a fresh kind of communication and collaboration ...\n\nPersonally, I would like this experience. I see way more chance for positive changes with this way of long-term communication than in a MTPM session that (per my experience as a panelist there) just could scratch the surface and clarify muttual positions, but without a chance of mutually affecting each others mindsets.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-08-02 11:06:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:30.270151", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 322, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24116, "user_id": 41, "topic_id": 1657, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Emergent Governance</b>\n\nI guess that when one talks about politics,\n\none often means so called \"representative politics\" ?\n\nWhich is a form of delegation of a certain kind of decision making power ?\n\n//\n\nI may join some of the ideas already expressed in this thread, and then suggest one approach :\n\nI believe everyone is involved in politics,\n\nthough not necessarily in representative politics,\n\nthrough every individual action,\n\nthough these actions are certainly influenced by context.\n\nHence what I wish is for people to make informed choices,\n\nabout the economic networks they choose to support,\n\nenabling each individual to choose the intentional economic networks they wish to contribute to,\n\nby having\u00a0access to an information system that enables them to do so,\n\ncollaborate with each other, express their needs , their conditions, enable contracts,\n\nand progressively build up a reputation which itself becomes the true currency.\n\n//\n\nThis is unlike the current monetary monopoly.\n\nThe current monetary system does not in my current understanding provide such opportunities,\n\nas it is systemically based on artificial scarcity, and rests on the goodwill and decisions of a centralized private banking system,\n\nenabling a minority of the population to choose the context they are willing to create.\n\nThe current economic system is not democratic.\n\n///\n\nI suggest using existing protocols, such as <strong>semantic web</strong> protocols,\n\nto express the kind of interdependencies we need and wish to contribute to,\n\nand visualize existing interdependencies and their consequences.\n\nSome ongoing work done to enable an interface to input and visualize such data :\n\nhttp://automenta.com/netention\n\n( http://sharewiki.org/en/Transaction_Graphs )\n\n///\n\nSuch tools, from my point of view, can enable emergent forms of governance,\n\nincluding all existing transactions,\n\nand enabling each of us to truly understand the consequences of the current system,\n\nand the alternatives we can create and wish to support.\n\nFor example, current money is created through contracts ( it is , in effect, a form of metadata )\n\nBy creating alternative forms of metadata, we can reduce our dependency on the current monetary units,\n\nand progressively overturn the ( in my view destructive ) effects of the current dominant information system.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-05 09:59:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:13.728455", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 426, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 31525, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1662, "post_number": 43, "raw": "<b>I meant theoretical and conceptual modeling..</b>\n\nModels make it easier to see the big picture, and even when they lead to some simplification. they help understand processed, and figure out what impacts what, and under what conditions..\u00a0\n\nAbout attitudes, Nadia's recommended article just above -

Looks dangerous without quality control, but.</li>\n\n<li>The supply chain basically goes from maker to distributor to pharmacy to home. If globalisation works, stocks can be small. Then, if globalisation doesn't work, stocks are too small. So it might be a good idea to have larger stocks for vital medications - where? Probably in pharmacies, because keeping lots of insulin at home might be a bad idea.

Albertos questions below are ones I'm also curious about, Im going to be in a workshop on funding and evaluating social ventures this weekend and it would be good to know more about your experiences.\n\nThanks, Nadia\n\n", "created_at": "2012-01-11 10:08:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:42.727086", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 93, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13806, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 1667, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I guess people are all different.\u00a0\n\nFor some reason I'm thinking about stories of people being stranded by air crashes, or at sea.\u00a0 They didn't always fight over the last tin of food - although sometimes they did.\u00a0 I think that facing adversity can strengthen the ties between people.\u00a0\n\nOf course it is a fact that some people really don't feel much empathy for their fellow human beings and I guess that such people would be more inclined to get nasty if things get difficult?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-12 23:32:55", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:18.058349", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 97, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25970, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1671, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>report</b>\n\n<span>You reckon, focus less on causes, and level but rather on the out of the box solutions?

I quickly realised that an idea comes when it has to come, and that often these ideas come from interactions and experiences. I also realised that a good way to facilitate creativity is to always look beyond what i already know, always learn and look for new experiences. And also that a wide range of various activities including artistic, production, spiritual, social, etc feeds creativity and empowers people.\n\nEdgeryders seem to have something in common : multi-disciplinarity and a wide range of interests and concerns.\n\nProjects could be personal through collective accomplishments as we all have this idealistic common goal : \"make everything better\".\n\nWriting a book, meditation, and other \"solo projects\" may be included in a collective effort to make things happen as \"collective projects\" need help from many individuals to happen.\n\nThe point i'm trying to make is that solo and collective projects will inspire and feed each others.\n\nTaking good care of a permaculture garden requires hands and willings, and it's an inspiring activity.\n\nThe main difficulty to make it work is to have a good balance between individual and collective investment.\n\nA way to get to that is to make collective projects priorities : individuals are part of the unmonastery, they don't simply benefit from it, and so they have to contribute when collective efforts need it.\n\nSo everyone should be concerned by cleaning the dishes and make sure the place stays clean and welcoming, help with the food and everything that covers basic needs. It seems like the first responsibility. The second one being collective projects and final one individual projects.\n\nDon't serve anybody.\n\nDon't be served by anyone.\n\nJust take part of it.\n\nHelp with it, collaborate.\n\nFeed your creativity, and express it.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-08-02 13:04:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:30.468625", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 359, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27998, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 1672, "post_number": 9, "raw": "100% On board.\u00a0\n\nWe've (Edwin, Nadia and Ola) been working together since \\#LOTE to pull some structure/foundations together to get this off the ground. So what have we go so far?\u00a0\n\nDuring the session at \\#EdgeCamp we wrote down almost everything that was said, that document is still in a fairly unordered format but since then we've broken it out into 3 practical documents; Scoping Report, Website and Framework. About 10 people from the session said they were fully onboard for this, if you're reading this, you might on be one of those 10 people, are you still onboard?\n\nIf you are -<strong>get involved</strong>- leave a comment with email and twitter!\n\nThe ideas that came out of the session were pretty mind blowing and broadly speaking seemed to reflect a desire to make the transient nature of the EdgeRyders platform solid, sustainable and capable of more than just knowledge discovery for the benefit of policy.\u00a0\n\nThe goal for me is to establish a network of spaces throughout Europe, half hackspace, half live/work - as was highlighted in the session; spaces of this nature are numerous already but many follow a single agenda, that isn't reflective of the transglobal attitude that was expressed at \\#LOTE. I see these spaces becoming a sort of physical node in the network. It seems most of us have already been prototyping this \u00a0in isolation, if we begin to pool that knowledge into a single project we could build an incredible amount of momentum.\u00a0\n\nBut we're a long way from the above, there's work to be done - beyond committing to the project; <strong>What are your ideas for taking this forward?\u00a0</strong>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-20 13:44:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:34.420390", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 305, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1707, "user_id": 30, "topic_id": 1674, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hi Alberto,\n\nso here's the key, to me: getting people together for prolonged thinking on deep topics is usually very expensive or impossible. Part of the reason my own main activity, the<strong><a href=\"http://hexayurt.com\"> hexayurt project</a></strong> moves so slowly is because we don't have much money - all progress is decentralized, volunteer, and \"it'll get done when it gets done.\" I tried once to get around this, with the idea of Guptafest (the name was a joke) - a nine-day conference in Cloughjordan, Ireland. The idea was that we'd all come in on Friday night, with the following schedule:\n\nFriday night, arrive\n\nSaturday, Sunday: meet, greet, discuss the big ideas and the topics of discussion\n\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday: work your day job 9-5 so you're \"working from home\" then, each night, have a dinner where we pick one of the topics and discuss.\n\nSaturday, Sunday: finalize conclusions, and prepare a report on the event, and then leave to be back in the routine for Monday\n\nThe idea was to have a chance to think deeply without interrupting people's flow of paying work, a chance to pack in just a little more.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow compare to the Unmonestary. It's a month, two months, three months. It's a chance to think at length, with the same group of people, with a few coming and going, on something. For me, I'd try and arrange to have some of the very smart software people I know get together and do some work on Free Software for Enterprise Logistics - figuring out on maps and spreadsheets how to manage resources for events like Burning Man (fun) or natural disasters (Work!). That's not a topic there's much work on, we'd be starting more-or-less from scratch. The NGOs doing that kind of work do what everybody else does: excel spreadsheets. The military use billion dollar ERP systems. There's nothing inbetween. Doing a project like that, in the initial stages, requires face-to-face meetings, discussions in front of whiteboards, real thinking about the structure of the job. \"What are we trying to achieve?\" is often a much harder question than \"how are we going to do this?\"\n\nSo to colocate a team to start a project like that, at the moment, requires a ton of money - flights to a location, somewhere to say, room and board. It needs people to clearl their calendars, too. By the time it's all done, you can't really afford to give away the software you wanted to make Free Software in the first place, and you might as well have started a company. It's not The Way.\n\nAnd that's why we need spaces like the Unmonestary. Cover the basic costs to buy the time to create great things to put into the Commons. It's a way of building big, complex things in the Creative Commons pool, rather than simply constructing more outright-owned artifacts just because independent hackers couldn't afford a hotel.\n\nIt might sound strange, but the difference between open and closed is often as simple as a workshop space.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-23 18:01:18", "updated_at": "2018-06-03 06:12:53.287031", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 561, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8172, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1674, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>I totally agree, have you seen the list of potential projects...</b>\n\nHey Hexayurt, have you seen the other thread in response to the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/few-us-living-together-somewhere-and-changing-things-unmonastery\">original post</a>\u00a0?\n\nIt seems this thing is moving forward faster than expected.

We adjust our time investment based on competing possible uses for that time, and the benefits they give us.\u00a0\n\nI am not sure what you mean by a filter that covers the platform as a whole.

Actually, it it not so simple to execute. The way it works is this:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>we do a dataset dump via the internal pluming of the platform (Drupal). It results in three JSON files,\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>then, a Ruby script (http://github.com/dragontrainer/edgeryders-mapper) parses the files, pulls the relevant info and reassembles them into a .net file, correctly formatted for network analysis software</li>\n\n<li>at this point, I load into my NetAn software of choice (Gephi in this case), apply the Louvain algorithm and obtain the partition into subcommunities. Notice that, though the same person is assigned to only one subcommunity, she generally interacts also with people from other subcommunitities. For example, look at the picture below: if you look to the top right, you will see that Beckery is connected to edges of different colors. So, it is not enough to take the mission reports and comments of all people in a subcommunity and do a word cloud of that: you have to assign each individual comment to the right subcommunities. And even that is difficult, because some comments (represented in the graph by edges) connect people in different subcommunities, so you have to figure out a way to parse those words.\u00a0</li>\n\n</ol>But having said all that, it is a GREAT idea. Thanks, I owe you one! I will pass it on to developers.\u00a0\n\nEdgeryders team members have been dropped out of the dataset to draw this graph. The reason is this: it is the team's job to talk to everyone, so we - by design - pull the network away from the segmentation into subcommunities (in the full graph there are many more edges, about 1500). What you are looking at is what I call the induced conversation, i.e. the pattern of interaction\u00a0among community members that no one from the team is involved in.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-08-07 12:54:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:40.363141", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 331, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12575], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22414, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 1686, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Unlocking pressure to perform a certain way</b>\n\nThe ways Edgeryders have to be making the transition, as illustrated in the paper, reveal a number of personal strategies that feel immensely useful for me personally..

Migration, with its direct and immediate human impact, is a very complex phenomena. Migration is not simply an economic issue. It generates composite ties, both interpersonal and organizational ties, as in dense, multiplex networks.\n\nNetworks hold greater potential for evolution, because of combination and increasing differentiation.\n\nTherefore, online networks and social cyberspaces do not just enhance of facilitate the transformation of identities.

If we agree on the fact that each individual is a 'designer of the future', and therefore plays a role in the blueprint of progress, of evolution, we could then realize and consider the need for studying the deeper transformation currently taking place in human beings. The transnational hyperspace allows us to be more conscious of it, just like social media allowed us to become conscious that where are all linked together (as opposed to separation).\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-18 22:02:52", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.381354", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 239, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30338, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 1688, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>Organisational theory / structure</b>\n\nHello K :)\n\nAs I've laid out in my response just now to Noemi I think organisational structure is very improtant.\u00a0 To get it right, I guess, requires looking at what type of organisation you want and how you want it to operate?\n\nFrom your description the project you are wokring on sounds quite exciting.\u00a0\u00a0 Certinly there are huge potentials in linking up civic actors at networking events.\u00a0 I wish you luck.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-09-05 22:06:39", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.086134", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 87, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [25273], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26308, "user_id": 128, "topic_id": 1688, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>\"Make everything better\" fund ?</b>\n\nI liked the idea of a make everything better fund, someone asked about it in the dear funder's letter thread if i remember well.\n\nConsidering crowdfunding, i'd like to see something like <a href=\"http://www.goteo.org\">goteo</a>\u00a0-which is supposed to allow to ask for money and services- but without the necessity to actually run a formal structure to access this kind of request.\n\nER structure could be funded through many ways : public help, private donations...\n\nThe more money it can get, the more people and projects it can help.\n\nBut projects and individuals could also express specific needs to allow crowdfunding for an individual or the project he carries.\n\nSo basically, the idea would be to have a mother project which goal would be to connect people, create events and unmonasteries... and sister projects which would be individual or collective projects.\n\nSo funders would be able to chose between supporting the entire structure, or a specific project.\n\nER members could then benefit from the structure and its members and from external funding and services.\n\nResource allocation could be discuted between ER members in a transparent way.\n\nMembership could be open to anyone.

I mean, we are leaving on the edge and yet in our on-line presence many of us choose as mainstream as it gets - just because of the network effect!\n\nSo here's the idea for EdgeRyders website (and something I will push to other places, too): why not use an open, decentralized protocol (like those used/implemented by Diaspora or Identica) and let EdgeRyders website be simply a user interface (with a vengaence!) to them?\n\nImagine if every account on EdgeRyders would be a Diaspora account at the same time. From the user experience perspective nothing would change - missions, comments, et caetera. But, other people using Diaspora would be able to connect to those accounts, re-share those posts, like and comment them, too! Suddenly, the EdgeRyders community would extend to the whole thousands upon thousands of users of free and decentralized services.\n\nI would love to get into details of this with some technical minds here!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-10-03 08:09:26", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:55.243300", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 286, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6503, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1719, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Finite?</b>\n\nHello Max,\n\nI have not read the thesis and I don't know much about marketing.

From what I hear, desire is endlessly regenerating itself - and indeed marketers have been able to create needs that were completely unanticipated before they came into being. No one could predict that round-the-clock access to Facebook would become a heartfelt social need, so much that parents punish unruly teenagers by withdrawing it.

Its insane for a country to put this kind of pressure on families. \n\nIn any case we went on to talk about how free education online might meet with official accredation by invention of a method of peer accredation where graduates and post graduates collectively mark papers based on online free online educational services as part of an initiative to provide support for students in these kinds of situations. Service to the comminity can come in mny forms other than risking ones life in someone else's war. \n\nAnd so we came to the issue of internships through this channel.

This kind of transparency would make it easier to coordinate a collaborative process of building the unMonastery space I think, and in a low trust environment is especially important.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-30 10:49:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:01.351624", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 285, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20355, "user_id": 1457, "topic_id": 1876, "post_number": 6, "raw": "\u00a0\n\nOk, here are some experiences...\n\nWhat do you guys think?

And then I realised it's totally relevant to this conversation, as well as that it would be helpful to have access to a number of examples of successfull and failed crowdfunding campaigns and how they were built....\n\nA: I don't think there's anything wrong with crowdfunding. Some people have inspiration and are expected to share it with friends. Others have money, why shouldn't they be expected to share?\n\nB: I think that over time social norms will develop to tell us when it is ok to try to get someone involved in crowdfunding and when it is not. As every other social interaction it takes times for the norms to become clear\n\nC: so, lets discuss, Mattias. when do you think it is ok, when is it not ok?\n\nB: I don't know. I hope smarter people will figure that out for me. And I am eagerly awaiting their results\u00a0\n\nC: i meant on a personal basis. when do you get annoyed or when do you get excited about a crowdfunding?\n\nB: I never get annoyed when people send me links about it. I get annoyed if they ask me to commit directly. I get excited when other people than the ones asking for the crowd funding are the ones pushing for it.\n\nB:i quite agree with you.\n\nE: Do you mean that you feel \"forced\" to donate because it's a request from a friend albeit indirect? Then I would say - donate if it's something you feel for and want to donate towards. If not, don't. You shouldn't feel guilty for not donating.\u00a0\n\nF: \u00a0I feel there are also different kinds of crowdfunding. Some resemble more \"Group Buying\" ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_buying ) , and some others tend to resemble more a charitable gift in support of a project. - I also have the feeling that depending on ones context, the feeling can be different. I know I started feeling much more at ease about the prospect of asking for money in Switzerland ( even if I did not ), feeling that money was not a problem for people around me ( during the short time I spent there ). Yet as most of the people I hang out with have no money, or very little, and as we all seem to be engaged voluntarily some way or another, it can feel annoying to see others ask me for money for things I do without being paid, or for which I do not get my expenses covered for.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-08-01 10:11:27", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:52.195891", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 494, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1504], "is_private": false}, {"id": 10603, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1836, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Abstraction =&gt; bad</b>\n\nHmm. From what I hear, this is sound advice, but kind of vanilla \u2013 it could apply not just to Economy App but to a great many projects; and not just to [Matthias], but to a great many entrepreneur.\n\nBartering seems simple, but I suspect it might prove quite tricky to get right. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years\">David Graeber</a> argued convincingly that the barter story we all hear (in a nutshell: barter was the primeval mean of exchange, then currency was invented to simplify the process) is simply false. This should ring an alarm bell: if our notion of bartering 101 is flawed, how can we be sure we are modeling it well enough to improve it via algorithm? And even if <em>Matthias</em> gets it right, how can EA work correctly if <em>users</em> hold flawed ideas about barter?\n\nHere's where I am going with this: my feeling is that it is time to focus on the product itself more than its business model. Mentors like to tell you about business models, because that kind of knowledge carries through more than technical or domain-specific knowledge; that's all good and well, but it still leaves you with the need to prove your point.

I think you are, because the attitude is the same. Glad to see we agree on this one \u2013 though one must always remember that we have little skin in the game, and that our advice should be weighed accordingly. Essentially, @ilariadauria, to answer your question: what I think is that we don't understand barter the way we understand, say, auctions. Economists get auctions: we have a well developed theory. This made it possible, even conceptually simple (though implementation is never straightforward) to combine auctions and the Internet to get online auctions. Famous academics helped design eBay's auction mechanism, as well as Google AdWords's. <em>But we don't get barter</em>. And the reason for that is that both currency and debt predate economics, and even philosophy. We have no written record of a society based mostly on barter. It's not a return to the past; it's an acceleration into the future. So you can't build a model of it. At least, I can't, and I can't point you to anyone who can.\n\nThis should not stop you. We had no model for the sharing economy either; in fact, textbook economics teaches that any non-privately owned resource must be maintained by the state, or succumb to the tragedy of the commons. But it appears you can build things without having a model. When Torvalds, Jimmy Wales and the others created the great knowledge sharing projects of our time they did not start by deriving a model: they started by making something. Later, people like me (only smarter) tried to reverse engineer why the hell this stuff so working so well, and explain it analytically to themselves and to other economists.", "created_at": "2013-07-26 19:45:06", "updated_at": "2019-06-22 15:28:42.348414", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 299, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [19611], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11413, "user_id": 82, "topic_id": 1837, "post_number": 3, "raw": "That's right: it's a pain for governmental institutions and large NGO's to apply on-the-edge methods.

Its very easy for a project like Edgeryders to be seen from above (i.e from those to whom you seek to sell services, or in the least by those upper houses\u00a0whom Edgeryders seek to mediate between) \u00a0as a kind of 'Ship of Fools' for the cap-in-hand precariat.

You can buy a ticket directly at the driver (though that's nearly nowhere advertised). Instead you're usually told to buy a ticket online at <a href=\"http://pugliairbus.aeroportidipuglia.it/\">pugliairbus.aeroportidipuglia.it</a>. This works when you're still at your desktop computer, but this is a <em>very</em> cumbersome process with a mobile device and needs printing a PDF as last step, so not applicable when you're already travelling (at Bari Airport, there is no option to print something whatsoever).\n\nBooking online however includes a guaranteed seat (through a reservation), but that additional Euro is actually wasted since the buses seem not too much in use (5 people in a 30 people bus today). But maybe for travelling back when you have to catch a plane ... but for that case, Noemi's linked document says that making a reservation is also possible by calling +39 835 901443 (not tried yet).\n\nAlso, depending on when you arrive, you might have to wait for the next bus for 3.5 hours. In this case, it's faster to go by train: there's a train station directly at the Airport from which trains go to Bari Centrale, and from there you can go to Matera.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-26 20:45:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:24.081524", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 261, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2154, "user_id": 81, "topic_id": 2121, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Following up on the <a href=\"/t/unmonastery/315/unmonastery-the-mothership-of-all-updates\">mothership</a> of all updates on the unMonastery and the documentation uploaded during and after the LOTE, here is a tentative of pinpointing actionables, priorities and practical issues linking them to what has been built in Matera.\u00a0\n\nSeems clear that the unMonastery is going to happen in Matera, and if we don't build on all the resources we have it's gonna be \u00a0hectic, to say the least: I guess there is not going to be much place for narrative and speculation in this post, it's more gonna be about organization and connecting the dots.\u00a0\n\nWe have 9 weeks to go starting from the 1st of December. \u00a0\n\nSelection procedure\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>when do we know who's going to be selected?\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>when unMonastariens are selected, they should: 1) send a video with the description of their project and the questions they want to ask Materani 2) send a written description of their project (+ eventual evolutions since some of the applications date quite back)</li>\n\n<li>video + project description is translated in Italian and posted on the 2019 online platform for p2p review.

It is not clear where to put news and discussions. If not, we will need to be quite tidy within the unMonastery project, which is the virtual room of Edgeryders where we are now. Create wikis, communicate clear what goes where etc.\n\nAnyway, latest news:\n\n*Paolo accepts the strategy we outlined. I am going to prepare a memorandum of understanding that covers the partnership between MT2019 and Edgeryders LBG for the CheFare application project.\n\n* @immaginoteca: we should <em>definitely</em> prepare a budget \u2013 even if it is not very precise \u2013 of what happens in the event we do, indeed, win the 100K euro. This is important for expectation managament and to avoid bad vibes in the aftermath. The budget is going to be based on activities: \"Activity A costs X\". So, if we decide we need some parametric design done, it goes in there. That is where you pencil in how much you get paid, and also what other stuff might be needed (materials?). In fact, to a first approximation, that's what a project is: resources needes, activities, outcomes. This will be @ilariadauria's key concern in writing the application!\n\n* Remember that some of the money need to be allocated against overhead (administration processes, infrastructure such as websites/social media presence/incorporation etc). In this case, overhead is particularly fair since both MT2019 and Edgeryders LBG have been investing significant resources in making the unMonastery happen for the best part of a year. For now, as you can see from the budget that was published, not a euro has gone to pay anyone in Edgeryders LBG (whereas some money has been put down to pay people in the community involved in the unMonastery project).</li>\n\nLet's keep working.", "created_at": "2013-11-23 11:01:06", "updated_at": "2019-06-22 17:14:59.867984", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 310, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30704], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12383, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2138, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Design tower</b>\n\nI will do you one better: your \"building bridges\" purpose (or function) is a legitimate way to see ER. Why don't you just <em>assume</em> this is indeed ER's mission for design purposes and build your design tower on top of it? And see where this takes you.\n\nAs for me, I have tried to tell you what I want: I focus on the protocol level of this thing. So I want a community that interacts fruitfully, with minimum entropy from trolling, beating about the bush, veto attempts etc. I want to watch in fascination what people actually do once they become ninja level collaborators on a large scale, and don't want to predetermine the direction and outcome of that collaboration. I (try to) design the low level of ER, but let the high level emerge.\n\nBut I am also an individual member of the community, swarming about like any other. In this capacity, I am trying to use ER as a way to get paid to work on interesting problems, and to be able to hire (at least temporarily) great people out there that have contributions to make. This does entail interfacing with the mainstream world, because it carries resources we need. However, I see this as a necessary evil: every time you interact with mainstream orgs you slow down by a factor 100.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-11-11 09:51:30", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:10.654405", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 239, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 6.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11180], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15355, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2154, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>It's on Wednesday from 8:30 am</b>\n\nI already made myself available and as of now trying to mobilize more of us in the community.\n\nSome of us also have an<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/crhkaecsiu35pqvjac26dlce5ng\"> informal online call tomorrow </a>and could be a good opportunity to\u00a0explain in more detail.

Concrete actionables. Then talk, email, phone, FB and twitter your existing personal network with calls to action. In doing this is it is\u00a0 helpful to have a focus, aim if you like, expected deliverables and deadlines to keep upp the energy. Other members of the community are happy to help if you are in the driving seat and people see that you are active in terms of drawing in people to work on initiatives with you in South Africa. If you want we can have a google hangout where we play around with ideas and maybe come up with a roadplan together if you want.\n\nCompetitions can be a way to get started because they have focus, deadline and built in incentive to start building the network. I was contacted and encouraged to involve Edgeryders in something called <a href=\"http://ideas.makingallvoicescount.org/\">Making All Voices Count</a>.

These are all very sleek and professional. I personally like Sentinel and Galeria\u00a0best.\u00a0\n\nDo you have any idea as to how a separate corporate website would be made sustainable? [Matthias] is skeptical of it, because:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>it means one more installation and maintenance tasks. He points out that many tech projects run into \"death by entropy\" as they become unwieldy and require lots of time and effort to maintain.</li>\n\n<li>On top of the technical issues, there are content issues: websites\u00a0need to stay up-to-date, with fresh content, deleting spam comments if comments are open etc. However sleek the design, if your last post was three months ago your website is going to communicate abandonment and desolation.</li>\n\n<li>Finally, there are SEO considerations. If all links point to the same website, we get better treatment by search engines.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWhatever its aesthetical issues, the Edgeryders community website is not an abandoned one. It has fresh content and new users\u00a0every day, and it has been so for more than two years. Rolling the corporate website from within the community site has the advantage that you get both technical maintenance and content updating for free. You (and others who are more familiar with the rules of \u00a0commercial communication) seem to think whatever we do with Drupal Commons is going to be subpar. So, I guess, there is no win-win solution: we either take the simple path (clean up the code of <a href=\"/company/home\">this</a> and keep everything on the same website) or the aestherically pleasing one (we run two separate installations).\u00a0\n\nSo, my question: what is the absolute simplest version of the aesthetically pleasing path? For example:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>no corporate blog, only static pages \u2013 how many, at a minimum?</li>\n\n<li>comments closed \u2013 no spam to delete</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAt this point, we need to estimate money and time costs of the operation and decide whether to take them on or not. What do you think?\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-23 09:53:38", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:52.702800", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 364, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13232, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 2283, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>Commission system</b>\n\nThe commission is charged from the seller. And it is\u00a0<em>really</em> charged in barter value only, meaning that the seller is <em>not</em> required to put in legal tender money. Think of this as the seller receiving a product called \"platform services\" for 7% of the value of his sales. The network barter algorithm has the task to make it all balance out, as usual. Since this product is required every time, the task is more difficult though. So we solved it by generosity: the platform gives credits to all its users, to pay for \"platform services\" that cannot be paid otherwise at the moment. These credits have a low limit of about 30-50 EUR, and the platform operators promise to only settle them in barter value alongside future deals \u2013 we think that users can be comfortable with these credits.\n\nIn effect, it means that the platform can get 7% of a trade's turnover and get products and services for it in that very deal. We will use it to build up the platform itself by getting us marketing services, community management services etc.. And for the financial needs, we will have a (prioritized) order for the \"money product\", which only comes in when people voluntarily spend it by using the buy-now feature. (In sort, a buy-now offer is for example: You can get this 50 EUR product right now instead of waiting for an automatic trade to happen, but then you have to put in 9.67 EUR in money, and only the rest is paid from your offers. The exact buy-now offers are again calculated by the network barter algorithm, so they differ according to the solutions it can come up with instead of being one fixed percentage in money. Effectively, money as a \"fluid\" product can be used this way to catalyze network barter deals to happen right now, also including products and services of 10-15 other users typically, who profit from the one user who agreed to put in some money. So if you want, what we propose is already a hybrid economy because of this buy-now feature.)\n\nHow to proceed? Let's first get the beta version finished I think, which is some weeks still :) Then we will show it to the directors and the community, and discuss a detailed strategy based on that.\n\n", "created_at": "2013-12-30 05:23:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.905534", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 410, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13229], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23391, "user_id": 105, "topic_id": 2313, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Choosing utilities providers?</b>\n\nDo we have any options in Matera of choosing who provides electricity, internet, phone, water, gas?

For example, if VA needs social media activity, it could put some money into ER that would bundle it with other streams of money to build a more-or-less full time social media job, which would then support all community projects including VA (perhaps with some provisions that VA gets an allocated amount of attention since it is paying part of the person's salary).

You try it, it can work or not, but the experimentation is valuable in itself - and the impact, if there, blows your mind..\u00a0</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-06 22:00:02", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.165212", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 277, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24881], "is_liked_by": [1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17222, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2470, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Thanks Pavlik</b>\n\nComing from you, this support means a lot!! :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-03-06 08:44:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:36.150948", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 14, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 1.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14650], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 14259, "user_id": 1680, "topic_id": 2505, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>clicky linky click click click</b>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/meadows/unmon/members\">https://twitter.com/meadows/unmon/members</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/benvickers_\">https://twitter.com/benvickers_</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BemboDavies\">https://twitter.com/BemboDavies</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elfpavlik\">https://twitter.com/elfpavlik</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/unmonastery\" style=\"line-height: 1.7;\">https://twitter.com/unmonastery</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/fortyfoxes\">https://twitter.com/fortyfoxes</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/adora___\">https://twitter.com/adora___</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rita_orlando\" style=\"line-height: 1.7;\">https://twitter.com/rita_orlando</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustLoveLois\">https://twitter.com/JustLoveLois</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cristianosiri\">https://twitter.com/cristianosiri</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AntonioElettric\">https://twitter.com/AntonioElettric</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Matera2019\">https://twitter.com/Matera2019</a>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-02-08 07:06:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:20.626034", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 180, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23575, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 2505, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>some data about my project for twitter storm </b>\n\n\u00a0\n\nsome data about\u00a0my project for twitterstorm\n\nmy twitter is @adora___\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/adora___\">https://twitter.com/adora___</a>\n\n(3 times _ )\n\nmy project name is , or can be referred as :\n\n\"upSkilling in Empathy\" \\#unMon project by Dorotea Mar\n\nmy \"tweet of the project\" could be\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/adora___/status/432636051253764096\">https://twitter.com/adora___/status/432636051253764096</a>\n\n<span>upSkilling in Empathy - how do we relate to each other better while co-Loving and co-Working - let's study this together at </span><a class=\"twitter-hashtag pretty-link js-nav\" data-query-source=\"hashtag_click\" href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23unMon&amp;src=hash\" style=\"background-color: rgb(245, 248, 250); color: rgb(8, 130, 83); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span>#</span>unMon</a>\n\nbut actually there is more in my project, but maybe for the first twitter storm just this will be ok :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-02-09 22:17:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:10.855121", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 234, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32414, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2523, "post_number": 28, "raw": "<b>Thank you!</b>\n\nHi Marina, I figured with George was not there, so no problem :)\n\n<a href=\"/t/spot-the-future-team/357-coordination-space/working-out-loud-what-were-all\">Here is the summary,</a> but essentially building on the twitterstorm communications and briefing ppl manning the twitter accounts.

Projects like small-scale social innovation and social change activism that happens, so far, at the fringe of society.

My question is which strategies and ideas you would use to connect us with these groups so we can discuss their experiences and learn from their ideas on this online platform.

As we discussed at the unMonastery - a great way to maximise the synergy between these two projects is to take advantage of the difference between the time-scales of the two projects. While the unMonastery-in-Matera project is hoping to extend its stay from the end of May this year, and secure additional funding, the Viral Academy has a longer timescale. I'm currently negotiating to reschedule the project and extend the timescale to the end of the year. The best strategy for effective synergy is to use the Viral Academy project as online support for any technology related training here in Matera, and to link it as strongly as possible to the unMonastery project I have here to create a sustainable festival owned and run by the local community here.\n\nThe link between these two things - festival and Viral Academy is already explicitly scheduled into the project plan agreed with Nominet (the funder), and is part of my original proposal to the unMonastery to work on the festival here as part of my residency, and lay the ground for a September event in Matera (working closely with the local community). We've made a lot of progress on this over the last two weeks which I will post about tomorrow.\n\nThe rational for this link is that the core outcomes for the Viral Academy are:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>To make learning technology more exciting</li>\n\n<li>To make learning technology more relevant</li>\n\n<li>To make learning technology more accessible</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThese three outcomes fit very closely with the methodology of project based learning, hackathons supported by an ongoing programme of online group work, and an eventual celebration of these projects in a couple of public events designed to inspire contributions and give projects a firm deadline for completion. \n\nI understand from @alberto, that the <span>September Edgeryders event to build a community-owned digital asset repository in Matera (back-to-back with OSMIT14 and the Italian OpenStreetMap community's meetup) would be a great focal point for both the original festival proposal I've been working on here with the unMonastery, and a chance to celebrate the work of local students of the Viral Academy.</span>\n\n<span>The Viral Academy is not a project focussed explicitly on teaching coding, but is designed to be applied to any form of learning. The context of the current EdgeRyders project is to teach technology - this includes elements such as video, radio, and more general skills such as event and project management.

I\u2019m adding a few thoughts here because I\u2019d been invited to by Nadia. Now, one thing I\u2019m going to say up front is that we\u2019re built on a perhaps somewhat different principle than what you guys might be aiming for, in that we believe that the final translation needs to be translated by a team of no more than perhaps 2 or 3 experienced, agile translators and a coordinating copy editor to bring it together, in order to be the very best quality translation that the material deserves. Our own experience with crowdsourced translation in the final result is that, while the experience might have been quite rewarding for the participants, the translation suffers. We\u2019ve been involved in helping to improve the end result of more than one of these crowdsourced works, so we speak from intimate experience.\u00a0\n\nWhat I\u2019d offer is that we might find some mutually beneficial ground where we can collaborate, if you\u2019re interested in participating in our process. We\u2019re hoping to team-build up to the point where our model can be spun off as one or more \u201cphyles\u201d, and to do that we\u2019d need to work in close cooperation with any potential participants in order to keep the quality standard up to the reputation we\u2019ve built.

In this way, the offeree agrees to a constantly renewed baptismal consecration according to the Benedictine spirituality \" (Statuto degli Oblati Benedettini Secolari 1,1). \"The Oblates in the monastic community recognize the primary reference point of their spiritual journey, and the community recognizes Oblates in an articulated expansion of their own charism, in a relationship of reciprocity and complementarity\" (Statuti, al n. 7).\n\nIn this sense, I do not want to create a category or a label (which I do not like in any case), but it is a way to improve the prototype by sharing personal experiences in the unMonastery. unMonastery is a prototype, and we are living it every day so it is important that we share our experiences and our reflections so we can improve it.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-05-08 22:08:01", "updated_at": "2018-06-01 06:16:46.333771", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 454, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [173, 4, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1536, "user_id": 128, "topic_id": 1503, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.37776332069188356\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; \"><span>I'm Nirgal, i'm 27 and until recently, i never managed to feel comfortable in this messy world.</span>\n\n<span>I never liked going to school, I was bored and i was often reading books or dreaming about being somewhere else while teachers were preaching their rules, their world. I truly loved some teachers, but i ignored most of them not because i didn't like them, simply because I didn't feel concerned.</span>\n\n<span>I've also suffered a lot, physically and mentally when i was 11-14 years old. I had to go to town in college, and i hated this place, these people, these rules, these never-ending days made of vomited knowledge. I hated it so much that it made me sick plenty of times. I was not happy in this world.</span>\n\n<span>It started to get better in high school. When i was 16, i met some guys with whom i could share some of my thoughts, it helped. I contributed to a anarchist newspaper called \u201cr\u00eavons des r\u00e9volutions\u201d. </span>\n\n<span>It was a revelation. I realised i needed to write, to share, to alert people about what\u2019s going on !</span>\n\n<span>Since then, i\u2019ve never stopped thinking about how to stop this mess...acre.</span>\n\n<span>Cause i see this mess as a mass massacre. Nothing else. Nothing less.</span>\n\n<span>It always haunted me, and somehow i feel responsible about it.</span>\n\n<span>At the end of high school, i had a choice to make. You know this time in your life you have to decide what your life is gonna be. What you\u2019re gonna learn and what you re gonna work during your entire life... I chose philosophy. I wanted to debate and develop my own thoughts, confront them to others. It wasn\u2019t the good place. I ended the year and watched for something else. </span>\n\n<span>Back then i was thinking : \u201cget quickly a job to be autonomous, then you will have time to write stories.\u201d It wasn\u2019t my smartest idea, but it lead me to fields I would have never been. And I sure don\u2019t regret it.</span>\n\n<span>It\u2019s quite accidentally that i found a job and a school to prepare a management graduate. It was quite cool, half the week sleeping in class, the other half selling and repairing computers in a small shop. But i got bored, repeating the same words and gestures. My boss proposed me to stay after the graduate, I refused.</span>\n\n<span>After that, I\u2019ve worked as a commercial in a small communication company that also had some publishing activities while preparing a communication graduate. I stopped it after nine months because, whatever my efforts to sell the communication products, I wasn\u2019t successful and the only thing i enjoyed during this process was designing and organizing the various actions I intended to find customers. </span>\n\n<span>After I graduated, I tried psychology.

After a few months, a friend working in video games industries told me about a project, and i did what I always wanted to do : I wrote. A fever made of words and worlds took me. </span></b>\n\n<span><span>My friend got a job and the project stopped, but I continued writing.</span>\n\n<span>In a few months, i had<a href=\"http://ecrire.ou.mourir.over-blog.net/\"> a blog</a>, I wrote three short stories. I was starting to meet readers and correctors as well as other writers, it was exciting as I was learning so much from all of them. I was in a wonderful community on a website where you can publish your stories, get corrected by others and correct other\u2019s stories. One day I published the beginning of a strange story, something brutal and dark. It came from nowhere and some people in the community loved it and gave precious feedbacks that allowed me to correct and rewrite it like I could have never done it alone. I was happy.</span>\n\n<span>I continued the story on the forum, i posted half a chapter each time. Improved it with the help of the correctors, then i posted the following half chapter. It was working well, but, somewhere like in the middle of the story, the moderators closed the discussion, arguing it was not the place to write a book.</span>\n\n<span>I had no other choice than to make my own forum and get the correctors on it. Some of them were ok, one more half-of-a chapter has been written there, but in the end, it didn\u2019t work as there were a lot of one-time contributors in the writing community.</span>\n\n<span>But the major reason why I couldn\u2019t write anymore is that I had to get a job. My social rights that allowed me to live poorly but happily were about to end. During one year, I tried to find a place, in big shops, door-to-door, mc donalds...</span>\n\n<span>Then, I realised i couldn\u2019t sell anything anymore. It was against everything i strongly believe in. At start, i told myself i was providing advices and services to people in need. It made me like my job selling computers, and i was good at it. But the other experiences told me it\u2019s much more about manipulation, tricks and lies with one goal in mind : steal more of their money. I felt that, to become a good seller, I had to turn off a little switch called humanity.</span>\n\n<span>I then decided that I would never be part of this shit again.</span>\n\n<span>That just lead me into another shit.</span>\n\n<span>No money, no job, no home, no future.</span>\n\n<span>I was pretty lost and confused, not to say almost destroyed, when a friend got me a job in the high school where I \u201cstudied\u201d.</span>\n\n<span>It just saved me.</span>\n\n<span>It pulled me together. </span>\n\n<span>Some broken pieces found their places.</span>\n\n<span>Some scars stopped bleeding.</span>\n\n<span>And I wrote again.</span>\n\n<span>The more I was helping the students, listening to them, caring about them, the more I wanted to help myself.</span>\n\n<span>During the last three years, I got a diploma of screen-writing, finished the strange story, got finalist to a writing challenge, worked again on the video-game project\u2019 scenario which, again, aborted. This second fail on the same project told me a few things :</span>\n\n<span>First, do not count on others. If you really want something done, do it.</span>\n\n<span>Do not invest yourself like a blind man in another\u2019s project. It it falls appart, you fall with it.</span>\n\n<span>If I carry my own project, it depends on me. And I wanted to do something concrete, something cool.</span>\n\n<span>That lead me to think more and more about what kind of life I really want. And how to get there.</span>\n\n<span>Eight months ago, Lionel, a dear friend I met in university while studying philosophy, announced me an important decision he made. It\u2019s only now I realise how his life\u2019s choice has changed mine. For ever.</span>\n\n<span>Talking about him could be a long ryde, longer than this one for sure...</span>\n\n<span>We had something in common. He carried a cross, I carried guiltiness. He believes in God, I believe in Humanity.</span>\n\n<span>We talked a lot about people, good and evil, the world. We shared many points of vue, except for one thing. Our faith. Our oath.</span>\n\n<span>And this day, there was something missing in his eyes. The darkness, the pain were gone, as if he had lost his cross. I saw him serene, decided, strong as I never thought he could ever be.</span>\n\n<span>He said he was going to live in a monastery, maybe for ever. </span>\n\n<span>His choice has been hard. He sacrificed a lot of things for something he believes in.</span>\n\n<span>His choice resonated with the crucial one I was thinking about.</span>\n\n<span>At this moment, I had two options in mind : stay in the society, the world where I am born and growth, or leave it to see if the rain is better elsewhere.</span>\n\n<span>It took some time, but I realised that I want to stay in this world but also that there\u2019s no place for me in this world.</span>\n\n<span>I want to be good, be an honest man, and most importantly, I don\u2019t want to have any god or master, a boss or whatever. It\u2019s been a while since I try to follow these words from Nietzsche : \u201cYou must become the man you are. Do what you alone can do. Become always who you are, be the master and the sculptor of yourself\u201d.</span>\n\n<span>I also want to have a simple life, to live on my own without having to depend on a system, an organisation. I want to produce my own food, share it with neighbours, share services with them. I don\u2019t wanna eat frozen meat from new Zealand that spent two years in a freezer traveling the seas. I cooked one of these, it was delicious, but it left a strange taste in my mouth.</span>\n\n<span>I need to stay connected. I love music, I use internet daily to stay in touch with friends, search, learn, share... Internet is what you want it to be. For me it\u2019s an extension of my brain. I can live without it, if it disappear, I will not fall apart, I will just be less efficient and lose plenty of time. And I just hate not to be efficient and to lose my time. I\u2019m always looking for better ways to organise and get things done properly. Internet is the perfect tool for that.</span>\n\n<span>I also want to be able to travel to see friends, meet new people, visit new places, new horizons... I want to learn from people all around the world, I wanna meet them, share with them.</span>\n\n<span>I want to travel the world.</span>\n\n<span>That\u2019s all I want and that\u2019s a lot, I realised.</span>\n\n<span>As far as I remember, I\u2019ve always wanted to contribute to something great, something not selfish, something for everyone. I\u2019m a dreamer, and I dreamt a lot about other worlds. I\u2019ve always thought things could be different. Should be different. </span>\n\n<span>And six months ago I had an idea about it. At first, I wanted to make a website to debate about problems to find a solution. During four months, I\u2019ve designed it, talked about with friends, teachers and students. Everyone of them gave me really interesting feedbacks.</span>\n\n<span>It took me a month to get something working with Drupal and the website is online since maybe two months.</span>\n\n<span>It\u2019s called <a href=\"http://demopolitique.com/\">d\u00e9mopolitique</a>.</span>\n\n<span>A web site designed as a tool to help a constructive debate which goal is to democratise politics, to discuss how we can live well together.</span>\n\n<span>The project is actually in beta stage and only in french. As a lot of tools are not completely designed or are under development, it\u2019s mostly a place to discuss about the idea of demopolitique. But we also started, with some other contributors, to discuss about subjects like capitalism or education. Some interesting things have already emerged, and we all have learned from other\u2019s contributions.</span>\n\n<span>It\u2019s mostly about learning, sharing knowledge and point of vues with people that want to see things change. A place where anyone can speak about his life or work conditions and suggest how it could be improved.</span>\n\n<span>The idea is partly inspired from the cahiers de dol\u00e9ances from the french revolution. With modern communication tools, it\u2019s easier than ever to learn, share, discuss, collaborate...</span>\n\n<span>D\u00e9mopolitique is about that, and it\u2019s about promoting responsible and autonomous ways of life.</span>\n\n<span>As i work in a high school, i\u2019m working on another project pretty close to d\u00e9mopolitique. The project is partly designed and is discussed with teachers, students and librarians. I need to design a new website for this matter for many reasons. it will take time, but it could be running in a couple of weeks. I already have a teacher ready to work on it with two classes before the end of the year. A lot of other teachers I talked to showed interest for this approach. In fact, the project is just a tool to help teachers organise working groups by using community tools. I\u2019d like to make this website a game, where every talent is rewarded. Some students like to search, and are good at it, some others like to synthesise and do it well... A lot of small actions can make something move faster. </span>\n\n<span>I am also part of a fab lab project which will use a tool mostly like d\u00e9mopolitique. The main idea of it is to provide a place with production capabilities and to allow anyone to come and produce anything for a cheap cost.</span>\n\n<span>This lab will encourage creativity, learning and sharing in a sane and autonomous place. We are designing it to be a place where you can live and work, eat, learn and share knowledge with various people.</span>\n\n<span>Ultimately we want to build something like an open source university, where every knowledge and skills will have a place. Somewhere you can learn anything the way you like. You could spend the morning in the field, learning perma-culture, breeding, tracking... and spend the afternoon learning economics, management, programing...</span>\n\n<span>These projects are ambitious and will take a lot of time and efforts. We\u2019re working on it since a few months and can\u2019t count the time spent on it. To be honest, we don\u2019t count it because we just have the feeling we are doing what we\u2019ve always wanted to do.</span>\n\n<span>Since I invest that much in something I believe is good for people, I now have the energy and the willing to make my dreams come true. And I realised lately that some people shared the same dreams and are working for it all around the world. It gave me hope, it gave me faith. Something like a month ago, I said to someone I\u2019d gladly die if I was sure it would help humanity. Sounds a bit fanatic ? It wasn\u2019t. I was pretty desperate about Humanity at this time. </span>\n\n<span>Now, I wanna live.</span>\n\n<span>Anyway, anyhow, I want to help good things happen.</span>\n\n<span>I want to help all of you, with my bare hands if I can.</span>\n\n<span>I\u2019ve always felt I was leaving on an edge. </span>\n\n<span>Between good and evil, others and me, peace and madness.</span>\n\n<span>And I feel like my ryde is just starting.</span></span>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-08 18:02:12", "updated_at": "2017-08-30 10:50:14.344322", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 4649, "wiki": false, "reads": 8, "score": 56.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3729], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6818, "user_id": 1933, "topic_id": 2967, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>One of the best ever activist campaigns in Armenia!</b>\n\n<span><span>It was really iinspiring to see how many people got involved - basically the whole nation!

They've used a micro-processor-based switching system, that switches between having all three cells in parallel and having the cells in series.\n\nIn series, they get more amps but less voltage, in parallel, they get less amps, but more voltage. They require a minimum of 14.4 Volts to charge the battery banks.

(I see that you may view the \"ticket for a dinner contribution\" as the same, but people usually arrive for dinner with a dish to contribute, and do in fact get a dinner as well in exchange.)\n\nSorry, i do not mean to be negative. I see you are doing an amazing amount of work. It is just that navigating the different interests and sensibilities in town is not easy, as we learned also the hard way. Marc may be a more useful contact for that than Ramona.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-29 09:47:23", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:57.862219", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 247, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32526, "user_id": 137, "topic_id": 3701, "post_number": 23, "raw": "Katalin, I am just checking the ground here - and as sheck is an example of stewardship, I just saw it really interesting to use it.

Welcome here from me too, BTW \u2013 I'm Matt, managing the tech side of this project.\n\nIn addition to the differences pointed out by Alberto above, here's one from a tech-centered perspective: in contrast to annotation tools meant for text study, ethnographic coding can easily lead to data for semantic web integration, basically as a side effect. Sure, <a href=\"http://openannotation.org/\">Open Annotation</a> as used by <a href=\"http://hypothes.is\">hypothes.is</a> also results in data for the semantic web, but the semantic level is low: software will only know (for comments) \"this is an annotation\" and (for tags) \"this is a concept\" but understand nothing about the concept itself. That's because people working informally with text can't be bothered to enter data in a more structured way. Ethnographers can, and in fact regularly do when they work with text. So later, there will be several specialized features that integrate RDF vocabularies and ethnographic tagging, and other features known from informal text annotation will no be there (no free tagging, for example \u2026).\n\n<a href=\"http://hypothes.is\">hypothes.is</a> is a great find anyway (thank you! didn't know it either so far). They include a severely <a href=\"https://github.com/hypothesis/annotator\">customized version of annotator.js</a>. Open Ethnographer will also use annotator.js and has to customize it, so we should take a deep look and see what we can reuse :)\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-03 00:27:29", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.921266", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 333, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [10295], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12995, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3969, "post_number": 5, "raw": "As far as I have seen, hypothes.is is not about argument mapping, either. It is for <em>informally</em> working with text, in the tradition of marginalia in paper books. The tagging scheme in it is simply free tagging, and it's meant to be used in a not-so-consistent manner and on a low semantic level. Semantic processing happens entirely within humans here. The only thing software \"knows\" if two pieces of text have been tagged with the same tag is: they relate to the same \"concept\", and concept could be anything.\n\nWhat I tried to say: the special thing about how ethnographers code things, at least as far as I have seen, is this: they develop their own vocabulary for one corpus of texts. It's subject-specific and idiosyncratic, but applied consistently, and well thought out. So these lend themselves naturally to be connected to <em>other</em> vocabularies of the semantic web, thus making the software \"know\" what these tags / codings are about, on a semantic level (e.g. about an <a href=\"http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/details/vocabulary_emotion.html\">emotion</a>, an <a href=\"http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/details/vocabulary_event.html\">event</a>, an <a href=\"http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/details/vocabulary_inno.html\">innovation</a> and many <a href=\"http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/\">much other stuff</a>). It provides \"effortless\" semantic web integration, esp. as a means of sharing and collaborating around the ethnographic research data. I have not investigated in detail if this matching to existing vocabularies would work out \u2026 maybe we'd better define an open vocabulary for ethnography some day.\n\nNote that this is not about forcing an ontology on an ethnographer. They can code however they like to. It's about capturing and reusing <em>some</em> of the meaning in these idiosyncratic codes by describing them additionally in a common vocabulary. If one day I can do a SPARQL query across 100 or 10 000 websites to serve me all text snippets talking about \"innovation\" and \"precariousness\" \u2026 that's how I see the potential of massive open online ethnography.\n\n", "created_at": "2014-12-03 14:10:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:13.647538", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 365, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [12697], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20546, "user_id": 119, "topic_id": 3975, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>Updates!</b>\n\nHey everyone,\n\nAs you might have noticed, I started to clean up a bit and - especially - to connect the dots.

I am very interested in that - mainy because I think it is largely a question of UX. For example, the amount of text you had to skip through to get an overview of the conversation, clearly resulted in a misinterpretation of what I written,most likely influenced by the perception you had of me once we spoke in Matera.

Most of the time spent working on the platform is done on volunteer basis. When client projects started to come in last year, there was a surplus after costs associated with producing deliverables were paid for. This surplus has so far gone into 1) paying for travel grants for lote4 participants and 2) some bugfixing work. E.g. we are waiting for Arthur and Alberto to find a little spare time to set up a financial dashboard so we can be totally transparent about money etc.\n\nI have never felt comfortable with there being closed groups on the platform. It was a compromise made based on a number of conversations in which the consensus was that we needed to have something semi-private but accountable, lest everyone just default into email or google docs etc which are far less transparent and or manageable (too many docs and hackpads spread all over the place). The reasoning was that once all the issues and concerns about privacy were ironed out it would be possible to just open groups to everyone in the community.\u00a0\n\nIdeally this would be resolved so we can get rid of them, but this requires more people to step up and help with solutions which do not make admins and content managers entirely dependent on developers for changes to the platform. For example, the platform really does not work well for making decisions where a lot of people are concerned, imho loomio is much better. But it's a mess when communication around projects is spread across platforms so we need some integration between them. So far the only person consistently handling the tech development and development has been Matthias, with some support sometimes from others, and he is already overstretched. So if you or anyone else can help, this would edge us closer towards a better setup.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-03-10 22:36:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:50.255684", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 345, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30746], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17569, "user_id": 2334, "topic_id": 4196, "post_number": 6, "raw": "You could localise the maintenance, and run diagnostic maintenance classes, so that users could get a discount, if they can catch the future problems early enough, that it would extend the useful life-span of the bike.\n\nThe maintenance classes could also be aimed at the bike owners, so that their costs are minimised and spread locally.\n\n(Note to self.

Quick thought: When basing your licence on copyright laws (which is easiest and does not cost patent application fees and stuff), you can <em>only</em> meaningfully have the rules you mention for digitally manufactured parts. For anything that requires users to download a file with data (3D geometry, gcode, whatever) to their computer. Because when they make a copy, copyright applies, and you can put in the conditions you like into the licence grant. Just like GPL requires shipping the code with the binary (or on request) \u2013 and the binary would be based on your code. However, if users can make a tool from OSHW documentation without making local copies of the documentation, you have no legal say via copyright. And viewing something in the browser does not count as making a local copy (in Germany at least, and I guess in many other legislations).\n\n", "created_at": "2015-04-08 21:43:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:41.528722", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 336, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17047], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1687, "user_id": 42, "topic_id": 1654, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.887308461824432\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; \"><span>Premise</span>\n\n<span>Since Edgeryders is first of all an experience-sharing platform, a session was devoted to show selected different projects from members of the community. From viewpoint-changing experiences in Iran to the use of the internet to organise protests in Poland, the diversity of profiles and interests of the community got to the fore, and did so in force, alongside with the community diversity.</span>\n\n<span>The experiences</span>\n\n<span>Micha\u0142 Wozniak - Participation reloaded: from anti-ACTA to citizen-institution collaboration</span>\n\n<span>The experience presented by Micha\u0142 was a light of hope for many of those present in the room, mainly those from countries where copyright laws and Internet control initiatives are being put in motion by governments no matter what. That is, most of Europe, in fact.</span>\n\n<span>When the Polish government was going to sign ACTA, Internet freedom activists (already experienced with the campaign to stop SOPA-PIPA just a few hours before) allied with the general population thanks to the history of Poland (with its lack of freedom of expression since the end of World War II) and coordinated street protests all around the country.</span>\n\n<span>And all this was done with the most basic tools current communications can provide: e-mail lists and phone numbers.</span>\n\n<span>Finally the Prime Minister, against the position of the Minister of Culture, accepted that the government had made a mistake by supporting ACTA and put a stop to it.</span>\n\n<span>This comes to show that social organization with new formats is possible (as was demonstrated in May 2011 as well by the \\#15M movement in Spain and later by the \\#occupy movements all around the world), and that governments are ill prepared for massive, coordinated but decentralized initiatives from the citizens. When there are no clear actors to negotiate with, nor representatives to bring to meetings, two outcomes are possible: either the government relents and cedes to the petitions (as long as they are kept clear and to the point) or commits political suicide and carries them out anyway against the will of an important segment of the population.</span>\n\n<span>Ginevra Sanvitale - Building digital commons: Wiki loves monuments</span>\n\n<span>The idea of an heritage photography contest is quite a given in most countries. However, using that photography contest to create creative commons licensed images to be used in any project, anywhere, is an initiative worth looking at. </span>\n\n<span>The creation of such a contest had a clear goal: provide Wikipedia with useable images not subjected to a restrictive copyright, while at the same time creating an awareness on the good side of the commons. In that sense, the initiative is laudable, as countries have been using their cultural heritage as an income source (often in an abusive way) for a long time now, as can be observed in national museums (not taking into consideration the possible damages a flash-taken photo can do to archaeological pieces, the main goal is to sell the postcard).</span>\n\n<span>With this contest, it is hoped the collection available to the public at large will increase massively, and reduce the stranglehold of copyright on creative people around the world. These kind of initiatives can be the basis of the emerging, commons-based economy, and indirectly a way to avoid the coming storm of intellectual property-based laws that will try to keep profits at all costs, culture itself if needed.</span>\n\n<span>Brindusa Luciana Grosu - Broken dreams: Transition to family and working life seen from the trenches</span>\n\n<span>From the apparently simple statement that work nowadays doesn\u2019t leave enough free time for family life (a statement that may seem overly simplistic at first glance), Brindusa tackled a problem that has been present in fights all around the world, from unions to feminist collectives, for years. How can we conciliate our work lives with our actual lives?</span>\n\n<span>The theories of sacrificing our own time for triumph in our work, with the current employment destruction all around the world, are losing their appeal. What was proposed here is a new type of contract: less working hours for a fuller life. While many will say that is unlikely to happen, and in fact the opposite is more likely in the near future, new job diversity and the almost mandatory need to become a freelance, depending on the area one works in, may see models emerge that manage this combination of personal-work lives far more efficiently than current 8-hour schedules, models of such variety that the only way to see them is to carry them out.</span>\n\n<span>Idil Mohamed - Meaningful diversity: navigating the different spaces of modern-day social interaction</span>\n\n<span>The management of social networks (physical as well as virtual and any mix thereof) is a worry for many today. It is fairly easy to collect hundreds of contacts and receive input from all of them, making social life a nightmare.</span>\n\n<span>Idil\u2019s proposal is to fine-tune the relationships, in order to keep diversity in one\u2019s own networks while at the same time keeping in check the respective contacts according to one\u2019s interests. </span>\n\n<span>It is an interesting approach, although a controlling one, which is sure to find adepts around. Although many people prefer to keep things simple and control as little as possible their environments, and by extent their networks, the sense of chaos can be sometimes overwhelming. The sole problem with this approach is that it limits cross-pollination of diverse individuals and experiences using yourself as a conduit, which could lead to lost potential.</span>\n\n<span>Ben Vickers - The graduate with no future: myth or reality?</span>\n\n<span>In the changing environment of labour, it does seem that traditional venues for work life are not exactly thriving. So, someone developed a program at Brighton University students to realize how things are out of the classrooms, and to prepare them for the big world.</span>\n\n<span>How is that done? For starters, forget about employment. The programme is designed to show examples of self-employed professionals and entrepreneurs for students to realize that there are several ways of making a living beyond the traditional job in a company. </span>\n\n<span>It can be posed that believing that everyone can create their own companies is a mistake: although graduates are supposed to be more capable of setting up their own jobs, the truth is that the educational system is based on traditional values and tends to create workers, not entrepreneurs. This program might be a good start to change this trend, and the way the world is changing, it was about time someone thought about that.</span>\n\n<span>Eimhin David - Social enterprise and social capital as a future solution for Europe</span>\n\n<span>The </span><span>homo globalis</span><span>, the perennial idea that with technology humanity will evolve into a new paradigm that will let us become a more just society. The idea of a new society emerging from permanently connected human beings has been there since at least the </span><span>cyberpunk </span><span>literary movement, and is rapidly growing as, in fact, society </span><span>is </span><span>changing thanks to interconnectivity. Now, defining how the change will take place is quite another issue. </span>\n\n<span>The fact is that connectivity is empowering, in a way. There can be as many venues to an evolved society as there are individuals in it, each choosing their own paths. Trying to articulate a system out of a mass of disparate individuals going their own way is a daunting task, and one probably doomed to fail. Still, modelling the future with predicted trends can help avoid, at least partially, the \u201cfuture shock\u201d in traditional structures as the new paradigm emerges. Of course, the survival of traditional structures in a new paradigm may or may not be desirable, and it remains to be seen if the modelling will actually help anyone understand what is going on.</span>\n\n<span>\u00c1sta Helgad\u00f3ttir - Travelling through Iran: freedom as a virus</span>\n\n<span>Using a travel experience as a conduit for thinking about freedom, \u00c1sta\u2019s talk revolved along some serious issues that are not yet overcome in Western society. </span>\n\n<span>Going to a country where most freedoms, as they are understood in Western society, simply do not exist, can be a sobering experience. Iran is a country with a government diametrically opposite to regular European ruling systems, and it may come as a shock finding, for example, a specific body dedicated to \u201cprotect morality\u201d by checking and policing clothing on the streets and make sure no religious rules are violated.</span>\n\n<span>At the same time, getting to know the citizens of Iran (and, in fact, of almost every other country one can imagine) can tear down several barriers set up by mainstream media in Western countries. While all one sees in media is an oppressed people ruled by a tyrannical regime (and there certainly that is part of Iran), the people are living their lives with as much normality as possible, and over all want their voices to be heard. Tourism is one way of managing to bring those voices across borders, and is far less risky than using the highly controlled Internet channels.</span>\n\n<span>Conclusions</span>\n\n<span>As a sample of the Edgeryders voices, the session presented enough diversity of projects, experiences and thoughts to be quite representative. Several aspects that worry many people today, such as activism, the future of work and intercultural understanding were addressed by the seven cases shown. </span>\n\n<span>The members of the community were shown to be idealistic, dedicated, conscious and most of all driven. Such passion combined with the chance to carry out the ideas and actions proposed could make society a fairer, better place to live in. Now, for that all that is needed it to drive the message home. Young people in Europe will not inherit the world. If the Edgeryder community is any indicator, they will change it.</span></b>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-29 15:54:44", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 00:24:11.320200", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2475, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5649, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5616, "post_number": 1, "raw": "\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/3/34504471b7c94c6f30bc80209538dde4cb1b447c.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"427\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/5/54d168c849b143d8a2784f1ca5123cab15af5afd.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"411\">\n\nWhen I visited Berlin-based artist and hacker Bengt Sj\u00f6len\u2019s studio earlier this week he was developing the hardware for of <a href=\"http://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/?page_id=392\">OpenDrop</a>: an open source digital platform for controlling small droplets of liquids using electro-wetting technology. It struck me that we ought to be looking at open wetware and synthetic biohacking in Opencare. Because there is a lot of scope for DIY and citizen science to actually make advances in developing new care solutions. There are many areas where this could help us to solve pressing problems like antibiotics resistance.\n\nBengt mentioned an experimental<a href=\"http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:Harvard/2007/Brainstorming/\"> initiative to use some of the properties of silk produced from recombinant bacteria to break quorum sensing</a>. This means you break cell-cell communication within and across bacterial species. It matters because this is a contributing factor to a number of clinically relevant things like making harmless bacteria produce enzymes which attack host tissues, produce toxins, stick to hosts and protect themselves while outside hosts. It may also be a way to break their antibiotic resistence\u2026.\n\nThe reasoning is that antibiotics typically kill or prevent proliferation of bacteria by targeting biomolecules involved in such essential processes as cell wall synthesis, DNA proliferation, or protein synthesis. Treating large populations of bacteria with such agents inevitably selects for a few resistant mutant cells. These proliferate, mutate further, and give rise to antibiotic resistant populations. So you want to get at the entire propulation and since the ability to communicate with one another affects behavior of the entire community....\n\n<strong>What makes these kinds of intiatives especially interesting is that they are being done in hackerspaces and garages using equipment that anyone can put together from recycled materials.</strong>\n\nThere are already examples where unleashing scientific experimentation amongst the citizenry at large has exceeded expectations.The <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/drug-research-thinking-inside-the-malaria-box/a-17239829\">Malaria Box</a> was an experimental initiative in which 400 diverse compounds with antimalarial activity were distributed in a bid to catalyse drug discovery and research for neglected diseases such as malaria. At a recent medical conference I heard that this initative <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jul/24/open-source-drug-discovery-research\">resulted in several breakthroughs</a> and a number of patents shortly after it was launched.\n\nI've only begun to scratch at the surface and have come across the Registry of Standard Biological Parts - a growing collection of genetic parts use for building biological devices and systems and IGEM (\u201cwhere future life scientists go to get their freak on\u201d). You can see the mind boggling list of what participants have come up with here (click on <a href=\"http://igem.org/Previous_iGEM_Competitions\">\"team abstracts\" from previous iGem competitions here</a>).\n\nWhat could be achieved if many more people were engaging in this kind of open experimentation?

I came across your website and saw that you are currently looking for local engagement managers for Future Makers Nepal Project under your kind control. That\u2019s why I would like to propose my candidature for this position. I have a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Agriculture (graduated in 2013). After finishing my thesis I was a project coordinator of the European Union funded project (Agriculture and Nutrition Extension project) for one year. Currently I\u2019m associated with a agricultural company as a part-time technical consultant. But after the earthquake, I really want to use my time and skills to support the earthquake affected areas of Nepal till the creation of a good working environment for agricultural services. I\u2019m very interested in this position because it\u2019s a great opportunity to support people, whose lives have been affected by the earthquake. It would be a great honor for me to work with Edgeryders because of its good reputation. I\u2019m very interested in association with an international team working for Nepal.

Currently I am associated as a faculty at Department of Conflict, Peace and Development Studies, Tribhuwan University. I teach political economy of conflict, human security and gender modules to the Master's level students at the department. Having graduated in Conflict, Peace and Development Studies itself I posses sizable knowledge on nuances of conflict, peace and development. I have experience of engaging with community at different level and I am of the view that engaging and binding communities is the best way to deal with any kind of crisis. The crisis that struck Nepal recently demands the high engagement of people and the state. More importantly what is needed is a border coordination between state, society and the international community. With an influx of aid from Nepal's friends far and distance, what lies ahead of us is the proper management and utilization of the aid. \u00a0Its time that we the people fill up the void and engage in whatever way we can to build our nation and probably that could be the only best way to revive and shine \u00a0at this moment of crisis. I myself was engaged in collection of relief materials for the earthquake stricken people in the Dahachowk- a village near Kathmandu. I took the lead to collect relief materials from my locality to be dispatched to the victims. Likewise, we conducted cleanliness and sanitation awareness campaign from the department at the wake of crisis. And surprising we were able to bring about a great deal of impact-- people coming out of their houses with brooms to clean up the street after seeing us doing the same brought joy to us. I have networks with people and institutions directly and indirectly involved in disaster management and with all the skills and network i have, I feel I can positively contribute towards this great initiative. \u00a0\n\nBest wishes for this great cause!!

These videos were aired on several thematical programs on IDP, all necessities and needs of people were given to organizations that were dealing with financial, material support for IDPs. These people are being checked upon, and there are plans of the second wave of investigation - one year after, since a lot of things have changed. And it will indeed portray the whole picture of the development of the conflict and situation in Ukraine (many return back, due to economic hardships in Ukraine, even though in occupied territories, economic conditions are even worse. Many launched their own initiative and totally changed their professions and life course. Some were disappointed in Ukrainian realities, some on contrary, became an active volunteer/journalist etc. Plus opinion of the situation has been changed in minds of Ukrainians in some cases.

Definitely challenging, engaging people merely online is not an easy job, but I guess that's what the engagement managers are for who actually live in the countries involved ;).\u00a0\n\nAlso, as the name indicates, this should mainly be focussed on youth projects? One interesting example I just recently discovered is about Ucha Kemashvili who lives in a remote village in western Georgia. He saw how devastating the braindrain of young people from his village was (everyone goes to tbilisi for jobs/education) and decided to create an incentive for them to stay: free wifi on the main square with a board which tells the inhabitants what kind of events are going on. It completely changed the village, a real community feeling was created. There's also Kedeli community in Sighnaghi (inga may have written about them last year?), a family who is helping people with disabilities - they live with them, are being cared for and help around if they can. For the ones who are able enough, they set up a social cafe where they work in the city center, to empower them. It's not youth, but a great example of grassroots initiative, and they often have young german volunteers helping ot for several months in a row. May be worth a follow up as well.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, I'll check some other things that were posted later.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-11 17:04:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.741063", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 280, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 1.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30383], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33662, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 6543, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Agadir is a sister city to Oakland California.

So, if we take that into account, greater goals are difficult to coordinate as people involved have their own schedules.\n\nAlso, people need to trust the larger goal and their leader(s).

The lag is of course very high compared to a skype call or an email, but the interface is MUCH more inclusive (not even literacy required). Also with the sneakernet bandwidth is really competitive, so you could much more easily pay for audio (and perhaps images).\n\nYep, people would be recording the incoming content themselves, and the devices with their stories would pass through curator/engagement manager hands every so often, to process the recordings that were made. Depending on how you \"program\" the agents, you should also be able to establish connections to very engaged people who are very remote from the internet (or dislike it somehow).\n\nPerhaps the architecture can be modified and adapted to aims, content, circumstances, and workload distribution somewhat but I think at some point you'll be involving some sort of curators that listen to a lot of audio content and take some notes every few minutes. The DAISY link I gave should show some options of improving efficiency. Of course you could also put some outgoing content on the players that will help the heavily engaged people to link up with you/leverage online resources without internet connection. For the general incoming content I could imagine to publish it twice: one \"raw\" version, and one version that is more heavily processed to highlight the presumably critical bits (perhaps with links back to the full context).\n\nThe network architecture, agent instructions, and incentives will probably involve quite a bit of specialization and small scale trial and error. It'll be somewhat tedious but it I imagine it is a near ideal playground for p2p and edgy approaches.\n\nI originally had this envisioned as a sort of distance education/home schooling for very remote and very poor areas. The info flow would be mostly (but not fully) outgoing in that case - but perhaps this way of using it will help designing it better as well. I got stuck somewhat on the issue of trying to keep fundamentalist propaganda and advertisement from taking over this as distribution channel. I also wanted to include an incentive to translate e.g. wikipedia articles into very small languages or something similar (just so you know where I come from with that idea).\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-15 08:52:37", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:46.721684", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 425, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [17202], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30630, "user_id": 2772, "topic_id": 4517, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>I'll be there</b>\n\nI heard about this at a Global Shapers event and really got my attention.

Our info panels and board games manly revolve around urban development, how to understand the legal system, how can you participate in discussions about municipality projects etc., but an important and I think crucial add on to this rather unsexy subject would have been to bring around initiatives active in the areas that we go to, to make it into a sort of local StreetDelivery and transform a neglected public space into something more for a few hours and offer local the possibility to engage with initiatives in their areas.

We might still do it as part of the engaging paid posts. But admitted, subtitling / transcribing videos or audio is a lot of too-much-work, just \"old school\" inefficient ethnography \u2026\n\nHowever acting as journalists or being embedded reporter who takes part in a project on the edge is however not really an option in our case, b/c this project is meant to be an active dialogue space in the end. (Also I'm somehow personally against including third-party reports into ethnographic research \u2026 so much gets lost by a different choice of words etc..)\n\nWhat remains as long as I see is (1) journalistic texts where the engagement manager posts all the key sentences verbatim (written down during the interview) and combines it with some photos and intro texts and (2) creative, low-barrier ways to attract both original input and discussion contributions <em>in writing</em> from participants. Will collect ideas for the latter in a comment below.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-18 13:19:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:38.273648", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 289, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [15549], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19094, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4417, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<a href=\"/u/community_service_of\">@Community_Service_of_Nepal</a> Hey Lisa, you sounded like a resourceful can-do person!

I really enjoyed the events and was very impressed by the diversity, talent, creativity and passion of the people who showed up to each event,\u00a0 and by the diversity of projects that seem to be going on in and around the community.\u00a0 I don't spend a lot of time using social media and am fairly average with technology and I haven't particularly engaged with the community in between those events. I'm now looking forward to learning more about Edgeryders and the extraordinary community.\n\nA brief introduction to me. I followed a fairly traditional career path, spending over 10 years working as a lawyer for large companies in the UK, France, Canada and Russia.\u00a0 I left that world in 2002, after I had a wake-up call. I was reminded that I had a deep love for the life in all its various forms and particularly things that are wild like oceans,\u00a0 forests and human creativity.\u00a0 Yet the one I was working in didn't seem to value these things.\u00a0 at the same time, I liked in respect of the people I work with. So I set off to see if there was a better system somewhere. Since then I have worked with cooperatives, fair trade companies, social enterprises and others\u00a0 looking for better ways of organising the bring out the best in people and serve all.\n\nOne thing I am working on at the moment it is\u00a0 a \"festival of human organising\" in London in spring 2016.\u00a0 I'm hoping to catalyse a celebration of lots of different ways that people are found to live and work together in ways that don't require top-down control. I feel this fits well within the range of projects that edgeryders gets involved with.\n\nBeing on the Board of Directors of edgeryders brings a particular challenge. It is the most formal part of the community, the part that anyone who wants to formally engage with the community will expect to work with.\u00a0 Thus we form a bridge between more traditional institutions and the more unconventional, wilder edgeryders community.\u00a0 Inevitably, in this role, at times we will appear remote and conventional (hence the image I attached to this post).\u00a0 I hope that we can also be truthful, inclusive and act in a spirit of service to all.\n\nI look forward to engaging with more of you on this great journey.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-22 10:34:56", "updated_at": "2017-09-14 18:39:33.702080", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 478, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 7.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1856, 4, 1485, 5, 8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12849, "user_id": 9, "topic_id": 4443, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Before taking unilateral action.</b>\n\nIn an open community that's focused on honest open discussion, however difficult and conflictual, I'd advise that before taking unilateral action based on your own perspective and unique technical rights that you at very least poll those taking part in the discussion whether it would be more productive to move the thread.

Doesn't help anyone, creates confusion. About the company / community relation, I still like the idea of having one community and lots of companies, embedded into it but separate entities from it, with clear rules that allow them all to equally \"capitalize\" (bad word, I know, just used b/c it's a commercial context here) on the open dataset of the community and to interact with its members. By being separate entities, and not governing the community website, the internal affairs of these companies incl. appointment of directors would be their own business, as it should be: decisions made by those who bear the liabilities. This would avoid a current source of conflict. I'll make and pursue a more detailed proposal re. that, but it's not the topic here now. I propose we let Arthur, Alberto and Patrick sort out the procedural and personal issues at hand here on their own, no need to interfere.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-05-23 08:29:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:37.551737", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 242, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [28172], "is_liked_by": [8, 2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28783, "user_id": 1687, "topic_id": 4433, "post_number": 17, "raw": "<b>The point</b>\n\nI referred to Patrick's angry accusation that Arthur is not serving the community.

I already have a very specific use case in mind. But it is a tickly one. I would like to push it with @ElaMi5 and perhaps one or two people from EdgeRyders who can attest that this is not completely bonkers and makes some sense (from their experience, and also so we don't completely rely on the UN to push this). It is out of competition for the ongoing challenge though. That challenge just sparked the idea. The idea does not threaten any business field of Airbus and they could use it as a test case to see if they actually can get more agile.\n\nOther story:\n\nIf Edgeryders were to help me with my current entry in the challenge (e.g. through illustration, or something I can't think of right now) - and I make a lot of monies. Then I would be very happy to fork some back. They have 3 categories including community prize, I don't think \"storming the election process\" would be fair - even though it would be easy money with 10k$ for the first prize. The other prizes are considerably more substantial.\n\n@johncoate : I'll answer here if that is okay. Airbus is a organizational dinosaur that has existed with no real predators going after it for decades. It is afraid that natural selection will soon ring its doorbell. They can see the future markets shifting to their disadvantage and realize they probably have to re-invent themselves. This drone challenge is only a placeholder (even though it is one of the actual threats to many of their products). It could also be the move to electric aviation for example. It is probably just as much a test case for implementing different info flow/process architectures\n\n", "created_at": "2016-04-26 16:35:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.745498", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 329, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30386], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26536, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 4454, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Some more leads</b>\n\nWill get in touch with David Windest\u00e5l, thanks looks interesting :)\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ashley.dara1?hc_location=ufi\">Ashley Dara</a> does hardware in extreme environments and has done work in Nepal ping <a href=\"/u/matthias\">@Matthias</a>.

for comments - and any help/advice for grant application</b>\n\nThanks for comments everyone.\u00a0 I've got a busy few days but will respond when I get some time\n\nI've been collaborating on another nomadic project that is very similar to what Jay is working on - I'll start another project on the platform to give some details shortly.\n\nI've been working on a grant application to support development of the project - the deadline is immanent so any quick thoughts / pointers would be most useful.\u00a0\n\nGot to sum all this up in a few hundred words + describe where the project should be in a year and what would be the deliverables (learnings to share to help get more new entrants into land based enterprises)\n\nWondering what to say about where the project will be in a year -\n\nHard to say exactly where things would be by then - based on experiences with previous projects maybe not far -\u00a0 could of just formed a team,figured out governance structure and working practices and possibly funding model.\n\nAlternatively (and often I like to be optimistic) If everything went very smoothly/fast could have a bit of land in 6 months and be engaged in food production by the time the funded period ends.\n\nNot sure which story to tell of where it will be or if I should map a range of possible trajectories (all within a very limited number of words!!)\n\nStuff I was thinking was to highlight that the project is somewhat unique as anyone investing or working will have a stake in the ownership/governance (be part of the commons) unlike in many other models where people are either hands off investors or renting growers or employees without any direct control.\n\nDeliverables no matter what the trajectory would be assessments-\n\nwhich channels found people that were interested - different social media, print media, events, real life networking\n\nonce people were engaged what channels strengthened participation in project governance/development from the demographic that are engaged -\u00a0 sms/email/meetings/snailmail/social media/video conferencing\n\nAlso looking at the demographics of those that express interest or start to participate in different aspects of the project -\u00a0 age/location (rural/urban)/other stuff?? education?????\u00a0 Who are the people interested??\n\nAnything else people can suggest for

And efficiency map \u00e1 la \"if we put X type of transportation option here Y people will save Z amount of time\" would be cool. But that is really hard to pull off if your name ain't google (or local telecom monopoly). But basically that is pretty much the direction of thrust. Of course you can't put all grannies on skateboards for example - so you probably won't get absolute values for each location. But for starters I'd suggest checking which important connections a lot of people need to do very often (backbones) can be directly or indirectly improved by doing more intermodal transport. Skateboard is not necessarily the most important bit in the scheme. You'll only know that in the end. But one more thing that a skateboard could do is the following: Sometimes people wonder if they should put bike racks on the PT (esp bus). If you have a skateboard you can usually \"play bicycle\" very easily. So you could test how the (subjective) improvement of transportation would be on a specific line <em>before </em>you have to refit all the buses. This is far from precise - but it also is much better than nothing. Duta could probably help with many of the details of what to pay attention to as well. But that is just a minor point.\n\nThe bigger point is the \"map\" - which really is a (complex) network though. But again - Duta will know this stuff pretty well already. One thing I did not think about is to hook this up the OSM - that is probably a very good idea! I wonder how long it'd take to get a few of the skater kids mapping stuff (I should learn it too). They could easily spot issues around town, as they get around a lot, have their hands free, and typically live right next door to the issues...\n\n", "created_at": "2015-06-03 20:38:28", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:06.033953", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 337, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [22225], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23157, "user_id": 1679, "topic_id": 4509, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Futurespotters at the Ouishare Drink event on Thursday</b>\n\n<span>the event on Thursday is taking shape, we believe there will be around 50 people <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/400763993458698/\">attending</a> .

But how to make sure they work for the right, sustainable kind of prosperity, not the crappy kind that has entrapped us in the west for the last 25 years at least?

I would also suggest reconsidering that decision. If these people meet them on your terms (fully wired and transparent), what do you have to lose? You can always agree to disagree?\n\n3. I agree that this is harsh, but in the larger context this is where the overwhelming majority of us is heading. Some faster, some slower, and some with a head start. I am quite sure that very, very few people will be heating with electricity in a few decades. It is madness. Unless you use heat pumps, which I don't think the people in question are doing. If you don't become more energy independent in the future - you will get hurt. One way or another. Almost always the short term cheapest and most effective way to become more energy independent is to use less energy. The alternative is doubling the price and building renewables (or as in your case nuclear power plants - but I don't think that'll make you more independent) with the money. There are no easy fixes.\n\n4. That may be so, but as one says in the US: \"Even a broken clock is right two times a day.\"\n\nI am not in a position to say anything with certainty, but I would urge you to check out the peace science/historian I referenced earlier.\n\nAbout energy for large communities: I strongly suggest you look closely at wind + heat pumps + insulation + solar thermal heating, and if it is possible to bridge some of the downtime with the other power sources you have available. If you have anyone organized in this regard it would be interesting what his/her take is on the situation, and I could discuss further details. There are options to involve or not involve the USA there.

A base implies that there is something on top of it, or refined from the base (usually not ad-hoc but more in the direction \"once and for all\").\n\nFor me leadership is not \"completely individual\". It depends on many factors if I feel motivated enough to participate (rare), or even lead (extremely rare). Most of the times I'd want to lead - I am not participating, and so have difficulties justifying taking the lead in something I perhaps oppose. Generally my readiness to participation or leadership is strongly predicated on the reaction of the people involved and close to me. It typically outweighs my internal motivation by a large margin. So in essence it is mostly my environment says if there is a chance that I'll move to a leading position.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-04 12:18:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:50.544362", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 490, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25148, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4623, "post_number": 11, "raw": "<b>!!</b>\n\nWow, this was fast and super effective, thank you!\n\nWhat do people think?\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e9b862b38a49cfc95c4356c4c7269c873786ba5e.jpg\" width=\"353\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/6/626710149ec3e60bee62e50d8a8870c2c5dae75b.jpg\" width=\"353\" height=\"500\"><br>\n\nMost important:\n\n- Is it on an A3?

Especially black (what you use most is not hard to improvise). You won't be able to reproduce the shades again - but given the nature of your work that doesn't matter much. What you pay for with paints is to a large degree the reproducibility and convenience. If you have a decent mortar + pestle (maybe 2-3 for different colors) and some time you can make the stuff on the side. I could imagine it is similar for some of the others from the wider group.\n\nIf you ever want something really, really permanent - get fast curing 2 component epoxy instead of yolk. You can adjust viscosity with aceton a little (try out first). Especially if you do pigments this is an option. But make sure you get fresh air when you mix pigment into the seperate components, fill them into a syringe (make sure you keep the ratios right), store cool, mix components directly before you use (perhaps in 2 batches). And mix well.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-10 10:51:18", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:59.508947", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 321, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [2201], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23440, "user_id": 2201, "topic_id": 4634, "post_number": 6, "raw": "So in 2013 the guys had brought a huge poster in front of the Parliament house in Yerevan which said\u00a0\u00abxe\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043a \u0441\u0443\u0439\u00bb (it's a word game - coming from Russian activists who did the same kind of protest in Moscow(\u0445\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d \u043f\u0443\u0439), when x\u0443\u0439 means dick and the first letter of the president's name is replaced with\u00a0x and is used as the first letter of\u00a0x\u0443\u0439).

If the design favours small actors enough, the capitalist idea of profit maximization is no longer applicable even though it's a market \u2026\n\nAbout regulation (second paragraph): I'll leave the nanotech and biotech etc. areas, where regulation might indeed be needed, to you :) Being in a \"least developed\" country right now made me forget about these areas \u2026 the areas where people here should self-organize require just expertise, not regulation: building roads, earthquake-safe buildings, Internet connections etc..\n\nI like the \"Rule of the Hand\" model. I can't really predict its socio-economical outcomes as I don't understand it enough, but it has some really nice innovative elements for sure. My only concern is that it only works with some coercive power to implement it, right? For that it needs a well-meaning functioning government (or army ;-) \u2026 which is absent in large parts of the world currently, so what I try is to work around this \"environmental limitation\" by relying on self-organized movements for getting things done \u2026 which has its own limitations of course \u2026\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-22 03:33:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:07.950796", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 254, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23042], "is_liked_by": [2551], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12417, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 4655, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>Ecovillage...</b>\n\nHello <a href=\"/u/ratmir\">@Ratmir</a>, welcome!

Matthias even <a href=\"/t/quakes-create-movements-but-can-we/4649\">wrote a piece based on these discussions</a>.\n\nAt the same time, I keep in mind times when I was studying at the University of Iceland and I took \"grassroot activism\" as one of my subjects. It was 6 years ago, and we went through a lot of literature, and the problem of motivation was always present. Very few movements, organisations, initiatives and ideas will ever manage to involve enough motivated people to do all the work.\n\nMotivation surely is a key factor and a tricky matter. About discipline - i hear a lot of stories saying that people are not really disciplined in Nepal, but I would disagree. They're just differently disciplined, with different objectives. They need discipline to survive, as they can only rely on themselves.\n\nI guess we should turn your piece a little bit upside down and start from this point: \"Many complain today that there is no room for improvement in our country because there is no room at all to begin with\". This seems so wrong in a country where so many things beg for improvement! Now, I am not sure if we should demand from masses, living poor simple lives in the villages, to feel motivated while they're just left aside and forgotten - first, basic improvements in their lives need to be done. We start then with inclusion, with a sense that everyone is provided and taken care of. Then, you can imagine there will be space for motivation. About discipline, the kind of discipline they teach you at schools is not exactly what I am a fan of. There is a need for independently thinking people who can work on they believe in and know the ways to make it happen. And the right amount/kind of it should be coming along with motivation I guess;)\n\nI'm sorry I am not making things clearer or simpler, just asking questions and wondering, but this is where we're all at these days - overwhelmed and puzzled about how to make good things succeed, searching for the right answers.\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-22 03:29:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:56.054549", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 415, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 22325, "user_id": 97, "topic_id": 4661, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>And 'Tree Crops'</b>\n\nAn interesting old book that inspired many people who have worked in this field is Tree Crops\n\nYou can read the most interesting parts here\n\nhttp://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/smith/treecropsToC.html\n\nor get the whole <a href=\"http://soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/010175.tree%20crops.pdf\">10 mb pdf</a> (probably a lot will not be relevant to the Nepal climate)\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-22 16:39:34", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:04.316307", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 74, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21312], "is_liked_by": [2551, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16320, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 4674, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>How to organize progress in construction?</b>\n\nWell <em>obviously</em> Nepal needs improvements in construction \u2013 means you chose a good area where to organize progress.

The \"local contact persons\" from villages who were active in post-earthquake volunteer efforts might even want to come to Kathmandu for trainings in earthquake-proof construction techniques \u2026 might that work?\n\nSo you are telling us by example that progress can be organized by raising awareness and spreading knowledge about existing solutions, right? Means, there's no need for a big social movement as long as awareness and knowledge are enough for everyone to \"do the right thing\" next time. I like that idea, because it is efficient. It can be even more efficient though by incorporating some PR / marketing techniques into your outreach efforts. A physical awareness raising campaign in an earthquake affected settlement might make you talk to a lot of people who can't or won't follow your recommendations later.\n\nSo, could there be more time efficient ways of awareness raising that also fit for the communication culture in Nepal?\n\n", "created_at": "2015-07-22 09:00:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:31.458080", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 202, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11875, "user_id": 2551, "topic_id": 4674, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>my 2 cent</b>\n\nOkay, I am far removed from the action but here are my 2 cent:\n\n1. Start where it is easy and somewhat effective. That would be KTM in my opinion. But do this in a mindful way that will let you ramp up and branch out where it is more difficult but has even more impact - clearly the rural areas are even more in need of this.\n\n2. Thus, as soon as you've got the first little bit of momentum in your group, and a tiny bit of oversight where things are going - split of a \"commando group\" that does a very improvised prototype of a rural workshop version in a conveniently situated village. You have to physically go there to work out and document all the little issues that can become show stoppers in such a more challenging environment. Don't send your \"best builders\" but send circumspect people that can listen and take pictures. Go through a bunch of what-if scenarios (while you are there). Prepare to fail, try to achieve 80% - be fair to the village community! This should be a very short gig.\n\n3. Come back to the main effort and keep the lessons in mind while you ramp up the main effort.\n\n4. Slowly start to establish a connection and a schedule for reaching out to villages/training some people on site in KTM.\n\nIf you search for \"holcim\" on the platform you'll get to some other contacts and material that may be relevant for you. If you need I can try to give you more support in specific things, especially if you want to reach out to people.\n\n@hector may also have some good advice.

I like this idea of protocols for human interaction, and I consider it to be generally applicable. You don't need an unMonastery (or a monastery) to derive benefits from good protocol. In the proposal I submitted to 32C3, I do not talk about the unMonastery at all, except to say that some of these reflections came out of its Matera prototype.

Specifically: do some work in making this idea communicable through a 20 mins talk, then put it in front of 32C3 and see if they come up with anything interesting. Plenty of smart people in that crowd, if they get engaged I bet we stand to learn something.

Today, every 67 seconds, a dementia case is found. It is estimated by mid-century that that will happen every 33 seconds because of the aging population.\n\nBetween 60 percent and 90 percent of people with dementia also have behavioral or psychiatric problems that come from the disease. And about 98 percent of people \u201cwant to live at home with dementia,\u201d Rabins said, \u201cNot everybody can. \"\n\nThe goal in Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatment, he said, is rehabilitation. \u201cWhat do rehabilitation specialists do?,\u201d Rabins asked. \u201cThey figure out what can the person no longer do, and then we give them an aid. If someone needs a cane because they\u2019ve had a stroke and they are weak on one side, we give them a cane. If they need a walker to be steady, we give them a walker. \u201cBut equally important, they also figure out what can the person still do.

There is even a CAPS\u00a0project called SciCafe 2.0 that returns broken links.\u00a0\n\nThis does not happen because the people behind those projects are stupid, but because running social media accounts, blogs, websites etc. is hard work. Doing it well on a project that will only live two years is wasteful.\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, if we did score a resounding success, we would start a spinoff producing care services.\u00a0\n\nBut then again we would probably run into copyright/trademark issue if that spinoff were called OpenCare.\u00a0\n\nSo.\n\nDigital squatting is cheap \u2013 good idea to squat everything opencare.\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, our dedicated social media channels are hard to grow into useful tools. For now, we get much more mileage pushing OpenCare content on the Edgeryders Twitter account than on the OpenCare one. For now, we use the OpenCare one to put out a sort of \"corporate\" feed about the project, with most of the interaction done through Edgeryders or our personal\u00a0Twitter accounts. Same thing for Facebook.\u00a0I predict most of the social media traction will be exerted through the partners, rather than the project.\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 500px;\">\n\n<caption>Twitter followers, Facebook page likes</caption>\n\n<thead>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">\u00a0</th>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">OpenCare</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">Edgeryders</th>\n\n<th scope=\"col\">WeMake</th>\n\n</tr>\n\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">Facebook</th>\n\n<td>134</td>\n\n<td>2,915</td>\n\n<td>4,420</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\">Twitter</th>\n\n<td>144</td>\n\n<td>3,579</td>\n\n<td>1,581</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\nWhen you move beyond FB and Twitter, I do not think it's worth putting any work at all in keeping OpenCare social media accounts. Our web analytics show that other social networks bring in a negligible amount of traffic. Uploading stuff onto project accounts should be viewed as an admin activity, not a communication activity, and therefore should be kept to a minimum.

Bordering on rock.</b>\n\nI must say I have avoided delving into any real detail on the issue. I did listen to a presentation of an official from Hebron not too long ago, which did make me more curious. As you describe above the issue is so badly deadlocked, I've become afraid that if I spend my time on this issue in a \"conventional manner\" it would likely not be well spent. That said I do little things here and there mostly as a consumer, where I hope not to make things worse.\n\nTo be honest my impression is that this issue is one of the remarkably few constants of geopolitics (even though it also seems to be oscillating this way and that). My interpretation is that this is because the issue has become a focal point political tensions from all over the place, which are now almost naturally channeled into the existing conflict. Like a tangle of lines tend to focus on a few knots, even if you pull on many random lose ends. And unfortunately, like you describe above, the situation has become chronic and developed all manner of secondary issues.\n\nThis has become so bad that I am not certain if it can be effectively addressed on a legal level. I am half of the opinion that if you naively apply (weak) international law to the conflict, you won't\u00a0 cut through the knot, but you may rather end up \"blunting the law\". Here I need to admit that I am generally skeptical about solving ongoing problems by law. It is certainly often part of the solution, but all in all I find myself more than a little unhappy with \"the mental model of the world\" that appear to underlie most legal considerations I know of. The binary thing is certainly a part of that. The other is the effectiveness of prescriptive vs descriptive norms.

Those substrates relate to one another through nodes on the right panel (catalysts). Catalysts are the \"reasons\" why substrates relate to one another. In the demo example, people get connected because they co-participate to political lodges (you may have recognized names from the so-called Paul Revere night ride from the American revolution). The quest is to try to figure out, for instance, who was in a position to reach all of those guys pretty quickly (in order to organize a mutiny before the British authority could counterfeit them).\n\nThe x, y position of nodes is decided in the following way: nodes on the right panel are displayed using a force-directed layout (ask me if you have no idea what that is). There is no absolute meaning in the x or y value, nodes are just positioned so as to have a readable display.\u00a0Nodes on the left panel are positionned according to how they relate to nodes in the right panel. The layout attemps at mimicking the layout on the left, substrates are positionned \"around\" the catalysts to which they correspond (although catalysts are not embedded in the panel. The reason is to make the selection more natural: when you select substrates\u00a0at the top in the left panel, you may expect the corresponding catalysts to be located at the top in the right panel.\n\nThe main feature is the easy selection of substrates or catalyst\u00a0using the lasso.\n\nWe'll be using Detangler with substrates=people and catalysts=topics, for instance.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n", "created_at": "2016-02-17 13:17:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:45.181728", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 307, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 32297, "user_id": 2464, "topic_id": 5227, "post_number": 36, "raw": "<b>Blame it on me</b>\n\nHi @MoE,\n\nyou are right, we decided in the end not to include anything about Wikipedia/data in the final program,\n\nmainly because we feared there wouldn't be much to investigate.

There are several ways to compute similarity between entities described by a \"bag of words\" (which you can actually see as embedded in a high-dimensional vector space ...). The better your index (words associated with entities), the better the similarity measures, from which you usually derive a topology by linking similar enough entities.

They say:\n\nZenodo is an archiving service. You upload one or more files, describe it with a bit of metadata and publish it. After that, we give you DOI so you can cite the data. Zenodo is a CERN service, so your data is stored in our data centres that we also use for the Large Hadron Collider, and CERN guarantee the data's long term persistence.\n\nIt sounds like you have your own \"data repository\" with live data that you can query and export. The way Zenodo is usually integrated in such as system is by taking snapshots of a dataset and archiving that snapshot in Zenodo (as you can change the files in Zenodo after you have gotten the DOI). This allows you to focus on creating a great service for your data, but not care too much about long-term preservation.\n\nAs for API documentation tools we haven't found sounds that satisfies our need fully. Usually, auto-generated documentation from the code is not very developer friendly but can be display without extra servers, where as developer friendly documentation is usually best hosted by external tools.\n\nSo, Zenodo does not really work for \"evolving\" datasets. It can be a place to store backups. But we have daily backups on Edgeryders, so I fail to see the point.\u00a0\n\nI propose we host data in the Edgeryders server, accessible via APIs.

Here are all the documents (selection criteria, deadlines) etc., altso useful for @LuceChiodelliUB):\u00a0http://projects.sigma-orionis.com/catalyst/open-call-collaboration/. I was involved both consortium-side (as Wikitalia) and open call-side (Edgeryders applied and got funded, and delivered\u00a0<em>great</em>\u00a0value for the project). Engagement in CATALYST was very low, nothing like OpenCare, and that move saved our asses.\u00a0\n\n<strong>Proposal</strong>: we (Edgeryders)\u00a0already cleared with Luce that it is possible for partners to hire independent workers. This is done through something the GA calls an \"equivalent appointing act\" to an employment contract.\u00a0She has a list of four conditions for that to happen.\n\n1. The partner keeps results from the person's work.\n\n2. The employee's tasks are duly determined by the partners from the start.\n\n3. He/she works in the partner's premises.\n\n4. The costs related to his contract are not significantly different from those for personnel performing similar tasks under an employment contract with the partner.\n\nThese conditions are all met if we accept that OpenCare's premises is the platform... which is true, this is the place where we are doing most of our work. It would be ironic if a DG CNECT\u00a0programme called Collective Awareness Platforms did not recognize digital platforms as a legitimate workspace! Condition 1 is a bit stressful on the social contract, but we can solve this by specifying we release the content as CC-BY immediately.\n\nSo, three possibilities, from easier to harder:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Easy: we invoke the CATALYST precedent, copy their procedure and go ahead.\u00a0</li>\n\n<li>Hard: we structure fellowships as \"employment equivalent\"\u00a0paid collaborations, done through equivalent appointing acts.

It's a creative use of that piece of software (albeit a bit overkill / heavyweight software, but it's fine). My task was to figure out how the consent funnel quiz can be made a requirement before users can (for example) post content to the OpenCare group and / or an OpenCare Challenge. I had a look. There are no off-the-shelf methods for this behavior, and I estimate the best solution is this:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Create a small custom module.</li>\n\n<li>Implement <span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules!system!system.api.php/function/hook_form_alter/7.x\">hook_form_alter()</a>, or perhaps more specifically <span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/comment/25048#comment-25048\">hook_form_node_form_alter()</a>.</li>\n\n<li>Determine if the user intends to post to the OpenCare group (via the og_ref GET parameter in the URL) or an OpenCare challenge (again via the og_ref GET parameter identifying the challenge, and a list of challenges considered to belong to OpenCare).</li>\n\n<li>Determine if the user has passed the consent funnel, using <span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.drupalcontrib.org/api/drupal/contributions!quiz!quiz.module/function/quiz_is_passed/7\">quiz_is_passed()</a>.</li>\n\n<li>If the user did not yet pass the consent funnel, display a link to that quiz instead of the node creation form, and a link back to the node creation form at the end of the quiz.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nI estimate this to be 1.5 \u2013 2 days of developer time. @Alberto etc., please decide if this type of integration is what you are looking for, and who should do the development. Unfortunately there is no way to do the integration by just configuring things (though I had hoped there is, and there are some <a href=\"http://drupal.stackexchange.com/q/154022\">leads</a>). So some coding has to be done, and I'd be happy to not having to do it right now.

Testing the consent Drupal module led @Matthias and myself to figure out how to do the implementation. We have one remaining doubt: at this point, the funnel will not allow you to post until you answer correctly. This encodes three possible\u00a0states:\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>The user has completed the funnel. She is sharing her content in full understanding of what she is doing.</li>\n\n<li>The user has not managed to complete the funnel. She does not understand the implications of sharing her content.</li>\n\n<li>The user has not yet completed the tunnel. We assume she has read our policy and is OK with it.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nBut there is a fourth possible state: the user understands the implications of sharing, and decides, after all, not to.\u00a0This means that the funnel \"works\" in enhancing her awareness. However, there is no way in the module for her to tell us, so that we can drop her previously submitted posts from the research material.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe suggest there should be an opt-out mode, where people explicitly deny their consent to having their material shared under the usual provisions. If they do this, their previously submitted material will be dropped from the Opencare research. Agreed?\u00a0\n\nHow to incorporate that into the module?\n\nIn practice I do not expect this to happen. But Matt and I think this would be a more solid procedure.\u00a0\n\nHow to proceed: let's agree that ther would be an explicit opt out. Next, you and your people can add it to the module (which should be easy). Meanwhile, we build the integration and deploy as soon as both things are ready. We estimate two working days for the integration.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2016-06-13 11:03:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:09.300088", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 342, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 5.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23268], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26811, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 5596, "post_number": 29, "raw": "<b>Remaining points resolved</b>\n\nAlberto and I fixed the remaining points.

Having someone who has engaged with the funded before would be really helpful when i comes to opening a dialogue with the organisation. I really appreciate the thoughts you've shared here.\n\nI think right now that the strength of the work i'd want to develop would be around the social/cultural therapy end. I have an early stages crazy idea that i'd like to use a platform like Edgeryders to encourage engagement and story sharing from people working in the tech/online communities (often, but not exclusively, young socially disengaged men with a disproportiately high risk of mental health disorder and often lacking in social support networks). My idea is currently that these stories, poems and thoughts could then be collated and presented through an number of ways, but my favourite (right now) would be to create an app that uses the same technology as the Pokemon Go system. Allowing these poems or stories to be placed into a real landscape (perhaps one that the writer identifies strongly with). People can then download the apps for free and engage with the works outside. Encouraging people to share, to go outside and see their words, but also to see others engaging positively with difficult truths in an anonymous way.\n\nAs an idea/project, it's right at the egde of my abilities but i think it might have enough edges of interest that might draw in other ER people if we can find a way of funding their work to develop the tech/care sides.\n\nSuper early days right now, but i think there's a bare bones idea in there somewhere that has real value.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-07-15 18:57:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:23.475492", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 298, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [23857], "is_liked_by": [4, 3228, 3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23857, "user_id": 43, "topic_id": 5729, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>Good thinking</b>\n\nI've done quite a lot of work on Wellcome funded sci-arts projects, or directly for the Wellcome Trust.

The site has undergone a number of iterations to get to where it is now and i think that we have a site that is much smoother and more aesthetically pleasing than when i joined the community a year ago.\n\nI agree that the mobile access is a problem, and it seems there are people working in the background to solve that. My view is that when i log in on my mobile i just want to read a comment or post. I'm probably not going to sit and write a response on my phone because i prefer to think deeply about my responses and respond in depth. My view is that i don't need to site to act as a social media platform. I want depth of field, not speed here.\n\nI quite like that the 'obsolete comments' remain in the system. Every few weeks i spend a day digging through the old projects, conversations etc on the site. It helps me see how things have developed and where the issues have been. I gain a much greater understanding of the path, the battles and the 'big picture' when i get lost down the old blind alleys and dead ends.\u00a0I think if we moved to a position where we only showed the finished product and not the working out we are giving a false impression, plus i imagine it would have negative impacts on both the 'openness' and the ability to analyse and extract quality data from the platform. But i wouldn't know anything about that specifically as i'm not a computer network scientist. I'm a poet and creative producer.\n\nI too am a big fan of the Google Docs set up. We use it to set up some of the Culture Team documents, and i think Alberto has had some successes using it for the OpenandChange application. It seems to work best for input from between 4-5 active collaborators though. I do think that it does decrease the number of people who engage with the document and\u00a0there are some on ER that are disincentivised to use Google products. Where input is wanted\u00a0from as many people as possible i think the messy solution on the site is still best for collecting that information from everyone.\n\nThose are my initial thoughts on your points. The Google docs link doesn't connect to a file so i can't participate in the process much further right now.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-09-21 12:43:51", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:20.050295", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 466, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [24803], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27204, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 5853, "post_number": 7, "raw": "<b>You are unusually politically sophisticated!</b>\n\nI may be way off the mark here (I am not British), but I think @steelweaver is thinking of the way the Leave campaign in the recent Brexit referendum used NHS funding as am electoral promise to sell their product:\u00a0\"Support us, and there will be\u00a0more money for health care!\".

As you say, I am not talking about true codes in the second example. The first is a legitimate organizing code that we could nonetheless use to write the paper.\u00a0\n\nThe second (Noemi's paper)\u00a0is more along the lines of what we discussed very early on with OE (and what is discussed a bit <a href=\"/t/open-ethnographer/578/would-ethnographers-do-open-notebook-science\">here\u00a0</a>)---- that people could have their own individual annotations. They could have their own codes (true codes), but I am suggesting that they could also use OE to create more of a project or paper workspace.\u00a0\n\nAs an example: if I am working with my own data on my own machine as an ethnographer, and I am writing an article on people's feelings about their medical devices, I would go through my own data and pull out sections of interviews and field notes and assemble them in another document, while leaving the original documents with the interviews and the field notes intact.\u00a0\n\nBut we are doing collective ethnography---- so it would be useful, within the tool, to be able to organize these pieces of information as they are relevant to a particular project in a computational way. So in the case of Noemi's project, say she clicks on pre-existing tags like \"acupuncture\" and \"alternative medicine\" and finds some pieces of information within those tags that she wants to use for her paper. She highlights them and tags them \"Noemi project.\" Then she can go and see all the annotations assembled under her project, and write her paper from there. Perhaps we would need to specify a different kind of tag ---- like a \"project tag\" as opposed to a code or normal tag (true or false).\u00a0\n\nI could see this being done really easily using the existing infrastructure, and it would be another step in promoting open notebook science when it comes to all stages of the ethnographic process.

On a related note, I'm getting posts popping up in the OC explorer that are marked as \"new\" when they are already coded----any idea why? Different from the \"x new comment\" posts, they are marked as though they are entirely new, but they are all coded.\n\nAlso, I know we are strapped for resources in this area, but now that I'm heading into a second pass, I could really use a way of visualizing all of my codes (VERY ideally without Inga's) so it is straightforward to move them into hierarchies and merge/fork/delete/rename them. Think of the priority at this stage as a categorization and editing of existing codes rather than doing new coding, and then we can imagine ways of making that more straightforward. I've just sent a WP to @Alberto which details the process--- I think even though new stories are being generated (that I am still coding) it makes sense to put energy into refining and categorizing (so stages 2 and 3 of the ethnographic coding process).\n\nAn interface to drag, drop, and rename (like @melancon suggested very early on in this process) would be ideal. I know that it is technically possible to rename codes as it stands (and I've been doing it when a needed change is immediately obvious) but it is very difficult to visualize all the codes (or even multiple codes) at once to see what needs to be edited.\n\nAnd as always, it would be extremely helpful to be able to only see uncoded posts in the oc explorer especially now that the majority are coded now.\n\nThank you!\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-29 00:15:57", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:55.847757", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 335, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8797, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 5949, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Packing for the OpenCare international network </b>\n\nThanks @Moushira, seems like a marathon!\n\nIf we can prepare a presentation post for each of the four projects - similar to <a href=\"/t/fostering-productive-potential-in-refugee-camps/670\">what Berlin students did</a>, asking questions and detailing their process\u00a0- we can better help them in their outreach, crowdfunding efforts should they wish to continue the work.

What insight could it produce and how? Ping @trythis and @dfko .\n\nIn your case, you have a blanco somehow with the \"team only\" conversation. It allows for some crude conclusions. I wonder if you can refine the insight somehow. An other possibility: how would a blanco look if you ran this on a random research project? Run an algorithm on a classical lab diary and an open lab diary on a highly similar research topic, with types of contributors etc. taken into account? This and other options seem\u00a0unpractical as the format of classical research is not very compatible. Does anyone have any ideas?\n\nOn the matter of \"the crowd\": this is prevalent on so many levels. Going against this is at the core of why\u00a0we do what we do in science communication and engagement. The narrative is always \"the public\" and \"science\" as seperate entities. This\u00a0vocabulary already skews everything at the base. There's always some form of elitism, paternalism, laziness in justifying research, general lack of insight in the role of science in society and so on. Even, and most\u00a0harmfully, from those that work in the exact departments dedicated to \"linking\u00a0science and society\", often unintentionally.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-03-14 20:32:33", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:30.510838", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 279, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 7.0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [26661], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 28450, "user_id": 3323, "topic_id": 6159, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Depends on priorities </b>\n\nAs I see it, there are two options depending on the scope of the paper.\n\nThe first option is that we leave the collective coding/ethnographic work for later, and focus on the question of action. If we do this, then I suggest I just do the coding to keep everything standardised. I will use Ezio's codes, and ideally we could separate them out using the colour scheme discussed with @melancon and @Jason_Vallet . To be able to distinguish these visually would be really useful. I could also sit down with @Federico_Monaco and we could do it together, or we could all as a paper-writing team sit down and do it together (so, multiple drivers, but only one manifestation on the platform itself). Via a hangout call or something like that. Could even record to preserve the inevitable hilarity :p (So more like option 1a and option 1b here)\n\nOption 2, the option discussed with @Federico_Monaco and @Jason_Vallet is to run the coding test off platform, on google docs or using a survey, so we can see the different things people come up with. I agree with them that it is too complicated to have everyone on the platform right away, especially given that the question of collective ethnography/coding isn't at the heart of this particular paper. We have to remember that we have a LOT of great data here as well as experiments in mind for the future that we can use in different papers.

Therefore:\u00a0 well done!\n\nGiven that, \u00a0@Noemi perfectly summarized what emerged: \u201c<em>we will need to explain\u00a0how to use best the material in opencare, <strong>starting from that which\u00a0already\u00a0exists</strong>; this allows us to develop a methodology, even if stretched\u2026 Emergence seems like a good concept\u201d. </em>\n\nI like this description because it proposes to focus our session on what, for me, is really the main point to be discussed. This <em>\u201c material in opencare \u2026 which\u00a0already\u00a0exists\u201d </em>should \u2013 of course- be better defined.

I propose to keep this within Google Drive, sharing project (sub-)folders as needed with more team people and making it a policy that everyone uploads the original artwork there. We have all our project files there already, so this would be the consequential solution. Even videos can go there, in their master file format.

Every thread (=topic in Discourse speak) belongs to exactly one category, and categories are used as the main structuring element in Discourse. I think they name it \"catagories\" only because posts from all categories appears in the same list on the homepage. It's not like \"being in a board / sub-forum\", where you could then see only the content of that board / sub-forum.</li>\n\n<li>We can of course disable the whole badges system (it's in the admin settings). I'd also recommend we don't go down that gamification path.</li>\n\n<li>Likewise, we may want to not use trust levels the way they are intended to. We might want users to start at level 1 or 2 instead, and disable automatic demotion of level 3 users by setting leader_promotion_min_duration to infinity (setting is mentioned <a href=\"https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-do-user-trust-levels-do/4924/6\">here</a>).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nSo there is some flexibility in the Discourse settings to adjust how it works, and I hope it will be enough for us.

October is also a harder period, as the season ends in september. The suitable places are 60-100km away (one in Flanders and a few in the Ardennes), and then still it would mostly be a club or an artificial pond because of the time of the year.\n\nHe gave me contacts at <a href=\"http://mouche-t.com/\">Mouche'T</a> (fly fishing club in Brussels), <a href=\"http://www.castingclub.be\">Casting Club of Flanders VZW</a> (fly fishing club in Ghent) and <a href=\"http://www.fario.be/\">Fario Fly Fishing Club</a> (fly fishing club in Diksmuide, West-Flanders).

By the way of example - my story about the failings of the Romanian medical system is[ here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/when-do-you-decide-that-running-from-a-failed-medical-system-is-no-longer-an-option/652/4).", "created_at": "2017-09-29 12:24:07.893825", "updated_at": "2017-09-29 12:24:07.893825", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 153, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 13.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [37165], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37866, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 6632, "post_number": 30, "raw": "Ok cool works for me. @natalia_skoczylas  and I have done some work to help facilitators structure documentation & sessions so that they are feeding into a concrete and usefull outcome.

No, we cannot use the codes associated, nor we should be using their topographic information (even in \"anonymous\" because basically it would take just a bit of work to re-identify the posts by comparing the links and the raw data available on the platform). According to this document -> http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/ethics-guide-ethnog-anthrop_en.pdf ethnography should adopt an opt-in stance and refrain from presuming implicit agreement by publicity. This is a huge hit on the networks, I understand... but under this interpretation the solution should be sought with the partners/contributors.\n\n2) we can consider the funnel as an informative process, adhering to what seems to be the use in humanistic research as acknowledged here -> http://aoir.org/reports/ethics.pdf \nThe idea that the funnel did not exist in a void, but it was accompanied by TOS and plenty other explanations about the functions and uses of this platform and its content was also embraced by our ethical deliverables. In this sense, although a transition towards opt-in is recommended (see above), it is not prescribed, in recognition of the reality that consent is a process, not a point-contract, and that for a long observation like ethnography, community managers and ethnographers on the platform served as part of the consent machinery.\n\nThus, after discussing with our advisors, we see only two choices: \n1 seeking consent or full removal from analyses,\n2 full inclusion, in clear.\n\nSince we have not read in full the entirety of the content on the platform, we are not aware of the feelings of the community and of those of the subset we are discussing here.

It's hard - but only once you manage to do it are you really independent and don't have to waste time chasing funders or whatever.\n\nIn the context of building the [OpenVillage](http://openvillage.edgeryders.eu) it could be very interesting to experiment with different ways in we can do commerce as a collective. It gets especially interesting if they are situated in economically lagging regions. How can we go about building it in such a way as to foster an entrepreneurial culture of community driven and owned commerce?

The system we were using in the restaurant worked like this. At the end of one week would choose the recipes for the next week - this would give us a list of groceries with exactly the right ingredients and quantities for the number of people who plan to be in the house. E.g. if someone is travelling it's less, if we have guests it's more. We then organise it so that people pick the days that they want to do kitchen duty and they prepare the meals either the evening before or the same day. This saves everyone time and it ensures we have no food waste. It also means we can keep a the food budget to a level that works for everyone by choosing appropriate recipes.\n\nThoughts?", "created_at": "2017-08-31 08:47:47.472216", "updated_at": "2017-08-31 08:47:47.472216", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 146, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 17.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 35705, "user_id": 3791, "topic_id": 6892, "post_number": 17, "raw": "All of those ideas are great   @matthias .

Full employment, high growth, the works. The town is called Sassuolo: it was then, and still is, the world capital of ceramic tile production. At the time, it served 40% of the _world market_ in ceramic tiles.\n\nCeramic tiles are a support of clay which gets sprayed with a kind of paint called glaze. The whole thing is then baked at high temperatures ( ~ 1,000 C\u00b0). The glaze vitrifies, and the tile becomes chemically inert. Glazes, however, often contain heavy metals to make pretty colours and aesthetic effects on the finished tile. This stuff was liberally sprayed in the air in manufacturing plants, where it entered the lungs, skinpores and bloodstream of workers. \n\nOne of these metals was lead. \n\nOnce in your bloodstream, lead stays there forever. It can even be transmitted from mother to foetus. \n\nWhen I was 6, in 1972, someone discovered that 12% of elementary school kids had \"too much\" lead in their bloodstream.  There was a major scandal. I remember that teams of doctors and nurses would come to our schools (very basic back then, we had no infirmaries etc..) and take blood samples from all the kids. \n\nWalls were black with dusts. Most of it was just clay (but even chemically inert PM10s are dangerous, as we now know). It was a hideous place. \n\nMy mother and one of my sister still live there. It's unrecognizable now.

And I agree, it is impossible to predict what is unfolding large scale. Harbingers would include for me the barriers that have become blurred between work and home since the heyday of office and factory, that the internet and home working have facilitated. 3D printing and other forms of small scale production like fab labs also play a role in that as does the new wave of 'cottage industry' that would include the growth of sites like Etsy and other forms of peer-to-peer commerce that also free more work from the factories. The potential to produce or buy directly from the producer has increased - around here at least the return of Farmers Markets in the past decade that I'd also see as part of this potential - more community gardens are part of that. I'd add to that stories of people leaving art school and university and starting up their own self organised places of learning within their communities. Perhaps even the difference in attitudes to home births and the existence of death cafes are somehow part of that convergence, the return from compartmentalised life. But also perhaps I'm over-stating something and am open to this being over-simplistic.\n\nI struggled with the rights/liberties. My re-telling of it may not have helped ([p78](https://www.ica.art/sites/default/files/downloads/Ivan%20Illich_%20The%20Right%20to%20Useful%20Unemployment.pdf)). It was partly the strong link Illich makes between health and liberties that interested me and beyond that long having had a sense that something did not sit quite right with me and narratives around human rights. I found the distinction that rights without liberties do not ensure  freedoms helpful.

I am having these sorts of discussions with many of the people I work with these days. I often find myself during my low days ignoring people entirely (it's especially different when I'm not needed to be face to face which often affects my mood and ability to engage.) It's been a liability for much of the way I've organized my projects and I haven't found a good way to manage. It's my ability to get really passionate and excited that energizes and instigates the communities I participate in, and then when I drop off the map during my low times things fall apart. For most of my life I've taken this as a personality flaw, some thing I need to work on (drugs, meditation, diet/working out etc) and my loops keep happening, my projects fall apart, and what hurts me the most is the feeling that I keep letting people down. \n\nNot sure what I'm saying other than, I'd love to discuss the individual within organizations - we've designed much of our societal systems assuming rational actors working at their best. How would organizations looked when it takes people with mood swings and the jaded and the in progress and and in mind? \n\nSometimes it's tough for me to realize that other people don't have minds like mine. A lack of empathy because I have no idea what it would be like to not be so bimodal. \n\nPerhaps an aside... I once went to 5 different therapists and they all thought I needed some work, one claimed I was bipolar and should be on drugs. So I went to a spiritual/life coach/philosopher/trained therapist dude, he said my energy was too high and I wasn't grounded enough to be able to channel it well - hence the highs and the crashing. I worked with him for a while - much of what I worked on in those days was to be grounded and accept what was happening without desire for any other states. I became quite neutral and my loops ended. I also felt inanimate, the whole point of lithium was to avoid those states. So I stopped and here we are in loopy days again.
