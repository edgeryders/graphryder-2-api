Let me offer ideas in the book which might answer some of your questions, just as a starting point:\n\n<em>how can unreliable people make a reliable organization?</em>\n\nNot sure why or where from you got this assumption that people are unreliable, although I agree there is a degree of free riding. Falkvinge's example is for \"disorganised\" people. His answer to this is by inspiring leadership: starts with formulating an epic goal which is measurable and gets everyone go \"Yes that's where I wanna be\", follows by setting up a credible path and measurable results. Administratively, getting there involves releasing control and delegating authority (eg decentralisation). This works in so far as everyone taking a management role fully understands the major organisation goal and doesn't let peripheral interests trump it. Coordination between those in key positions who are taking responsibility for the org is tight, but <em>people are let to do</em> <em>whatever they want and when they want it,</em>\u00a0because it leads to people self-organising and earning a vested interest in seeing their work get through and move towards change, on their own merits. Of course there are many other structure/value related stuff, but I thought this\u00a0<span>is the greatest insight of the book.</span>\n\n<em>which projects have managed it, and how?\u00a0</em>\n\nIn Falkvinge's book - the example is The Pirate Party\n\n<em>do we need reliability anyway?</em>\n\nIf by reliability we mean the capacity to perform (oversimplifying maybe), and the capacity to perform is vital to the very existence of the organisation, then yes.\u00a0\n\nBut I'm curious what references you have before engaging more in the discussion.. Coming in to the session with a shared understanding of terminology would take us farther I think..\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-09-23 07:33:14", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:50.538012", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 409, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 8254, "user_id": 66, "topic_id": 1463, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>Hello, Florina!\n\nNice to meet</b>\n\nHello, Florina!\n\nNice to meet you!\n\nIt's very interesting what you wrote and I really agree that all of us we have to learn how to learn and that we could learn anything, you know how they say : Nothing is impossible, the word itself says: I'M Possible:)\n\nBut, I want to add that we have to take in consideration also the talent that you are born with, and wich you have to work a lot in order to develop it. I mean, yes, we could learn anything, that's how they learn us in schools, a little from everything but not everyone has talents for drawing or dancing or not everyone is given to understand sciences or to practice medicine, that's why we have many specializations.\n\nThe idea that i am trying to say is that in my opinion we have to discover first of all what are we the best at and after that trying to \"sell\" our skills.\n\nLook, for example, i have a very good friend, she had nothing to do with music, she doesn't even know the piano notes, but when she hears a melody she can reproduce it in 2-3 minutes only by hearing the sounds. And i was really amazed because I took classes of piano and I could see other people who learned technical things that you could learn, but they didn't had the sense of music.\n\nSo basicaly, I agree with you, but we have to take into the consideration our individual talents and to develop them.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-04 09:54:41", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:47.822449", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 282, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60285, "user_id": -100, "topic_id": 10764, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Removed content", "created_at": "2019-10-01 13:01:58.517844", "updated_at": "2019-10-01 13:01:58.517844", "deleted_at": "2019-11-04 10:55:14.048968", "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 0, "wiki": false, "reads": 0, "score": 0, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88556, "user_id": 6756, "topic_id": 15075, "post_number": 5, "raw": "That can actually work.\n\nImagine a work of art: the raw ingredients are the canvas and paints.

Some join in, actively listening, asking questions or giving thoughtful responses. (This is a safe place and not for debating opinions or speaking for others.)\n\nThe discussion begins with first hand accounts of attempts taken to solve societal issues and moves to navigating the personal challenges experienced by members. Nuances and the various different contexts surrounding these challenges begins to show.\n\n* Listening sessions around key issues.\n* Webinars to present and discuss case studies.\n* Special P2P support sessions dedicated to individual members projects\n* Online co-creation workshops to design and plan joint actions.\n* Online hackathons and adaptathons to accelerate existing initiatives through technical support\n\n#### Information analysis & Action\n\nNext open source technology is used to make connections between topics being discussed, the people discussing them, places, projects, solutions and struggles. When we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources.\n\nBy the end of the process, our community members have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.\n\n* Preparation: Collecting and discussing case studies, preparing initiatives for the hackathon, Pre-event introductions and networking\n* During the event: Rigorous documentation, definition of a list of follow up action points with clear allocation of roles and responsibilities, open participatory budgeting for the activities.\n* Follow up: Rapid deployment of the actions (1 week cycles), followed by open participatory evaluation and codesign of next cycle based on lessons learned.", "created_at": "2020-06-25 09:28:22.622454", "updated_at": "2020-06-25 09:28:22.622454", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 404, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 41.8, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [79336], "is_liked_by": [6455, 6679], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15896, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1490, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Like a seed</b>\n\nAs I am marking this mission report on the map of future builders, I send you a 'reminder'.\n\n\\#justsaying\n\nI noticed that you often say that you have difficulty defining who you are, and what you do, or where you want to live. I have read this in many places, ie 'About me' in your profile, etc.\n\nPersonally, I have found is that when I state an intent, it actually provides an anchor.\n\nSometimes it is rather really hard for people to state an intent, because they feel they have to commit. Sometimes people just aren\u2019t ready to do that or they really don\u2019t know what they want. A lot of people have so many things in their heads and hearts about what they feel they would like to do.\n\nThe process of actually articulating it is important. The process of writing it out, and letting go of it is very powerful. This is what Edgeryders is doing, it helps people to write about their dreams, goals and intents, and other participants encourage them. That\u2019s what\u2019s so cool about social media today: there are tools that make you feel more connected and even more happier by sharing.\n\nLike with a seed, we have to plant them, but don\u2019t go and take the seed out every day and check it. It is going to grow, because we nurture it and we give it time and space. In achieving intents, we can\u2019t be obsessive and too attached.

But herein I diverge from the same:-\n\n* magic convertor: The concept is slightly different. I already mentioned that the raw materials and the finished products can be traded like in a commodities exchange, but that's not I am after. I am after the value derived from the conversion. Let me give you an example: in US - both natural gas and electricity (in the form of \"kilo-watt hours\") is traded. But please note that they are traded separately. What if one commodity can transmute into another? What's the benefit of this? Unlike the futures contracts traders (who would be present in such a system), there would be traders in the process who would try to maximize the profit from the conversion: that of natural gas into electric power. If we have a cap on the price of power, in order to maximize profit - they would try to drive down the price of the natural gas. This puts the downward pressure on the price of natural gas and reigns in inflationary trend. \n\nNot only we are using this platform to drive raw material prices - but to see which alternate emerges the best? Solar/hydro/nuclear would/can be cheaper than the gas guzzlers. If we transmute this form of energy into electricity \"kilowatt hours\", then traders would realize more value from renewables than the gas guzzlers. This would incentivize green-tech at the foundation of this trade. \n\n* Human labor as stocks: @Bill & I were discussing on the same. One of the ways that we can put a price on human labor is by trading in indentured labor contracts, but that moves in the direction of slavery.\n\nSo certain human labor has to be out of the stock exchange. What we can trade in - this is where we want to bring the service industry into play, is \"experiences\": movie-going experience, buying a piece of art. The state tends to earn more through services than through manufacturing, as the RMs and fixed costs are low. So a % of that can be given to the artist as an incentive.\n\n* Innovation: In the same manner, we can incentivize the innovators. By giving them a % for their intellectual labor. \nThe innovative product would command a higher prices on the bourses than a commodity. Let me give you a crude example:\n\nIf abacuses trade on the bourses and someone invents a computer. The value of early computer would be say 100X an abacus. Hence, it would trade for more than an abacus. Of course, we have to streamline its costs but you get the gist. It is possible.\n\n\nSo @yudhanjaya & @alberto, is there a way in which we can incorporate the idea in the world that you are building? I would like to work on one of the cities with this idea as the core. If anyone would want to collaborate to write a short story on this - looking at you @Bill.", "created_at": "2020-12-08 03:08:51.652573", "updated_at": "2020-12-08 03:08:51.652573", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 496, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79544, "user_id": 6455, "topic_id": 13924, "post_number": 8, "raw": "Okay Nadia, happy to do this.

Mining my / our own data in an open way would indeed be interesting! However, there's one beneficial side-effect of all this secrecy around corporate data mining: no need to really, properly anonymize the data.\n\nI'd say that nobody knows how to properly anonymize it all. Remember that case where Google released some archive with pseudonymized search queries some years ago? Some days and people had identified the first one who was behind a row of search queries: an old woman, and she confirmed this were her queries. Google pulled that package, and never offered something like it since ... . (Sorry I have no source for that ... I looked, but could not find it on the web for now).\n\nSo dumping all Edgeryders data (and even with these semantic annotations!) into the open is like obtaining a dump of Facebook's user data or similar ... . Properly anonymizing would be the way to go in the long term, but that's unchartered territory for now that I'd not like to tackle in the limited scope of the Edgeryders project. Given the frequent references to personal projects in the Edgeryders data, anonymizing is pretty darn complicated ...\n\nIf you didn't find it already, I re-started this privacy discussion in its own mission report, as proposed by Alberto.

In this case, the project manager would have to inquire from the person who was paid or from the payment manager if the payment was made, and at what date. The total time efficiency is higher, and the number of annoying messages with questions lower, if we make the payment manager enter the payment date (into the same row that contained the data relevant for payment, so no need to look around).

Spirituality and religion should be separated from the church. I know they pretend to be representatives of God on our mother Earth and they would love to set the moral/ethical standards for humanity but my truth is: They have become disconnected from spirituality, churches are institutions, organisations full of corrupt men which don't live what they preach. I know there are good men in there as well but, I researched the subject a lot and I must say my feeling is they were corrupted by enormous power.\nThroughout history religions had many roles, most of the time necessary. I read the Bible, Qu'ran, many books on Budhism, Hinduism, myths of creation from different cultures, historical books on the subject as well. I also regularly have discussions with Priests, whenever I get the chance actually, so I am not a total outsider there.\nWhen I read the holy books I understood parts addressed the issues of that era, they often offered good solutions for those issues. Most of it shouldn't be taken literally as far as I am concerned ;) .\nHowever i believe Churches need to evolve, accept reality in which they exist at this moment. They also need to work on their credibility if they want to have a chance of participating in future decisions. Their structures protect some very corrupt people and as long as that is the case they will keep losing members. \nAs far as the moral code goes, I focus on human interaction and try to make sure the end result in any case is beneficial for everyone involved.\nFor me key things are empathy, humility, understanding and taking responsibility: if you at least try putting yourself in other person's shoes, if you try to understand them then you hardly can have negative intention and act in a way which would be detrimental to someone else. Combine that with owning your actions, taking responsibility for your actions, words and thoughts, would also naturally lead you to a better moral code...simply because ego wouldn't find excuses so easily ;) .\n\nAs you said, family and our immediate surrounding are crucial for establishing that set of cores values, which becomes our guide in life...to each his own perception of this reality.", "created_at": "2019-06-29 00:35:13.090129", "updated_at": "2019-06-29 00:35:13.090129", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 384, "wiki": false, "reads": 22, "score": 44.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 4773], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58003, "user_id": 5292, "topic_id": 9878, "post_number": 30, "raw": "Great discussion here! \n\nTwo ideas I wanted to add to the mix.

It creates instant websites based on files of a special type, called the *configuration files*. Each configuration file  generates a website. The webkite can in theory support an infinite number of websites. This addresses a strong need in Edgeryders, that of having multiple, simple, specialized websites. The platform is great, but it is very big (70,000 posts) and can be intimidating. For example, you could want a simple website for your unit (like [this](https://research.edgeryders.eu), or for an event you are organizing. \n\nThe webkit allows us to do this, with:\n\n* **No need to install anything**. No matter how many websites we make, they are all created by the one installation already on our server. \n* **No need for software** other than the browser you already use to access the Edgeryders platform. \n* **Full compatibility with the platform**. You can tell the webkit to display on your website the content of a single Edgeryders post, but also of a category, or a Discourse tag. Anything you can display on edgeryders.eu you can also display on a webkit website. \n* **Automatic updating**. Suppose your website contains a feed from the #campfire category: when a new post is made in that category on the platform, it will automatically show up on the website. This last feature is useful because it means we can control what's on our website simply by making normal edits to posts on the platform. For example the list of projects here: https://research.edgeryders.eu/#projects is taken from [this post](/t/13664/1). If we want to add a project we just need to edit the post, and it shows up automatically on the website. \n\n## How it works: introducing configuration posts\n\nTo access a webkit website, type in the address box of your browser:\n\n> `https://live.edgeryders.eu/12345`\n\nWhere `12345` is the number of a topic in edgeryders.eu that contains the configuration file. You will find the same topic at `https://edgeryders.eu/t/12345`. For example, the Research Network's website lives at `https://live.edgeryders.eu/13865, and is generated by the configuration file that lives at https://edgeryders.eu/t/13865. \n\nConfiguration files contain the instructions for the webkit to render your website. They live in posts on the edgeryders.eu platform. This means you can create and edit one just as you do with any post. But they look and behave a little differently from normal forum posts. In the rest of this manual, we speak therefore of **configuration posts**. \n\nWebkit configuration posts are in a format called XML. XML files are made of \"blocks\"; each block contains some content and some styling decisions about that content. Look at this example: \n\n![image|690x259](upload://zbcDSeWh3ziIyBhLPHw7HSezCS0.jpeg) \n\nYou can see seven blocks: `Config`, `Menu`, `Header`, and four  `Content` blocks, called   `\"about\"`, `\"methodology\"`, `\"projects\"` and `\"partnership\"`. You can have as many blocks as you want. Making a website with the webkit is about deciding which blocks you want; then preparing the content (text, pictures, videos... ) for each block; putting the blocks into your configuration post; and adding some finishing touches as needed.", "created_at": "2020-06-25 10:30:08.394618", "updated_at": "2020-06-26 08:25:08.482133", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 552, "wiki": true, "reads": 16, "score": 8.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63533, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 11396, "post_number": 6, "raw": "So nice!

I look forward to hearing more about your experience in Brussels :slight_smile:  \n\n@markomanka Of course and thanks for asking. There are a few domains that I am currently loosely exploring.\n\n- Voice interaction in Arabic. This is an area that has been growing very rapidly in North America (think Amazon Echo, Google Home, wearables like smart watches that rely predominantly on speech for interaction) and will continue to grow. The software required to enable anything like this is far behind in Arabic, and I am exploring 1) how to change that and 2) if there is a business opportunity at the moment in doing so.\n\n- AI for living life. This may sound a bit abstract, but I find myself spending a huge chunk of my time trying to answer the question of \"what should I do with my time?\". I have the hypothesis that AI can help with that question, but I need to dig deeper into that to know for sure. My theory is, if life is a set of experiences, then it should in theory be possible for computers to enumerate all the different experiences you could have and figure out the optimal experiences to pursue. I don't have concrete thoughts on how something like this could be monetized, but I feel like there's something there.\n\n- Intracity Logistics. The ultimate goal of this is that, if you and I live in the same city, and I want to send you something tangible, it would take me at most 5 minutes of work and you\u2019ll receive it in at most 24 hours with no work on your part. Cairo was the city that inspired me to think about this. It's incredibly busy with a lot of traffic, and having an efficient system to deliver goods would be incredibly valuable (for both people and businesses) given how much time people waste in traffic.\n\nAt the moment, ideas are a bit broad and there isn't an overarching theme necessarily to the ideas just yet. I'd say the two obstacles I am facing right now are:\n\n- Finding people to brainstorm with (and potentially work with as well)\n- Learning about different industries and their problems. My knowledge on most industries (say, healthcare or aerospace) is super limited and I'd be interested in exploring how software and AI can be helpful in those arenas.\n\nLearning about people's experiences in the gathering in Brussels would be what I look forward the most, since it would serve as inspiration and/or remedy to the obstacles above.\n\n@bilal So looking forward to catching up again in person!\n\n@matthias Do you have a dataset to work with already, or is that something you plan on curating yourself?", "created_at": "2017-10-13 16:14:31.358800", "updated_at": "2017-10-13 16:14:31.358800", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 459, "wiki": false, "reads": 33, "score": 171.6, "like_count": 4, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3729, 4, 854, 3838], "is_private": false}, {"id": 1528, "user_id": 92, "topic_id": 1495, "post_number": 1, "raw": "I like getting rid of things.

I took it to the office and asked my girl peers: who wants a pink eyeshadow? I want, said Olya. Next day I see her wearing on the new eyeshadow. It's been more then half a year since then,I still see her using it. Isn't it cool? This is such a win-win situation that you could not even think of better. She's got a thing she needed. I am glad to see it in use. Eventhough evidently it  was not a smart shopping decision, and one might say a waste of money ultimately, it gave me such a cool feeling of satisfaction and something much more...\n\nI cannot say it was a life-changing experience, but it did change me from within in a certain manner. I have re-thought the material value of things and the feeling of separation from them is rather a pleasure than a feeling of loss.

Room F was where a lot of the discussion on the economic dimension of the data ecosystem happened. \n\nTo my surprise, the MyData community seems to have a rough consensus that monetizing personal data is not a long-term sustainable way to run a data economy. The person that came up with the clearest formulation was perhaps Finnish lawyer Jussi M\u00e4kinnen (not verbatim, I am quoting from my notes):\n\n> When copyright was invented in the 17th century, lawmakers conjured up a new property right, the right to own something immaterial. They knew it was a bit of a ghost, with little grounds in terms of the legal system of the time, but they wanted a way to reward the creators and their publishers. That, however, created more long-term problems than it solved. So, we have learned from the copyright story that legislating  private ownership of personal data is probably a bad idea.\n\nThe parallel with copyright seems a profound intuition. On reflection I see how it is, in practice, a similar situation. Humans had been producing content before copyright, but when large-scale reproduction was invented in the 16th century suddenly there was an economic value to (cheap) copies. This created a conflict on who got to appropriate that value, and as a result a new legal subsystem sprang into life. With personal data is the same: they existed before the Internet and data science, but now they are worth money, and this creates another distributive conflict. \n\nThe chair of that same session, John Wunderlich, is Canadian. He remarked that Canadian First Nations have created [their own set of principles](https://fnigc.ca/ocap) around data  management. The reason:\n\n> In the past, Aboriginal people have not been consulted about what information should be collected, who should gather that information, who should maintain it, and who should have access to it. The information gathered may or may not have been relevant to the questions, priorities and concerns of Aboriginal peoples. Because data gathering has frequently been imposed by outside authorities, it has met with resistance in many quarters.\n\nThe most enlightening presentation was Ingrid Schneider's . She is a political science professor at U Hamburg. She described four main proposals around the economics of a data society:\n\n* Individual data ownership + micropayments (Jaron Lanier, 2015). \n* Data as public goods, managed by the state (Evgeni Morozov , 2017) \n* Data as commons (Elinor Ostrom, 1990), managed by communities.\n* Fiduciary trust (David Winickoff (2003 &amp; 2005), where people commit their data to fiduciary trust, who governs the system.\n\nSchneider discussed the relative merits of these four models, and made a case that Europe is currently \"squeezed\" between a Lanierian-dystopian America and a Morozovian China, but maybe Europe could (and should) develop a third way.\n\nShe went on to remark:\n\n> The discussion about property rights is an Anglo-American one. In the European legal tradition, we have the notion of inalienable rights: we have them, _and we can never give them away_.

When?\n\nSomething in your project reminds me of a different project we are working on at Edgeryders. It's called Future Makers, and it's about DIY urbanism. Not so much city\u00a0<em>planning\u00a0</em>as city\u00a0<em>making</em>, directly. It happens in three cities: Yerevan, Armenia; Rustavi, Georgia; and Luxor, Egypt, under the aegis of the United Nations Development Programme. Working with UNDP, we have noticed that there are groups of people who are trying to \"edit\"\u00a0the city as if it were a wiki, without necessarily going through all the mandated procedure. Some of the \"edits\" are good, great in fact: look at this Cairo neighborhood were people got out with\u00a0<em>bulldozers</em>\u00a0and build <a href=\"/en/constructing-a-ring-road-exit-by-the-people-egypt\">four new ramps to access the ring road</a>!\u00a0\n\nIn Future Makers. the city authorities and the\u00a0local \"city hackers\" agree on a street, or a square, or a park, that is marked as \"editable\". Within the limits set, everything is allowed, as long as the people build it themselves. We will then see what happens.\u00a0\n\nFuture Makers has a workspace here on this platform, but they have decided to keep it private, so, I can't share what they do with you. But if you are interested you can ask for membership of the workspace \u2013 just send a message to Noemi from here: https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/noemi , then click on the \"Contact\" tab.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-14 15:07:16", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:40.012266", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 313, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26488, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 3884, "post_number": 14, "raw": "<b>Welcome, also to codesign the tool</b>\n\nThanks for the introduction, Irene.

But most of the mistakes seem to come in during execution / organization building, and for that part a kind of \"anti<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language\">pattern language</a> of failure in social innovation\" would be a very valuable tool for any social entrepreneur \u2026\n\nAnd: since you're one of the early adopters to do online ethnography, please feel invited to try out the Open Ethnographer tool when we get to a first release :) It should be agile development with weekly releases, starting around early/mid December.

Not an expert, but I reckon issues they will have to come to grips with could be\n\n- scope of the rules (what 'AI' systems should be covered, only top consumer/citizen-facing applications, or other/underlying infrastructure)\n- type of obligations (only transparency/documentation requirements?, what should they contain?)\n- How to differentiate, depending on scale (i.e. me building system affecting 10 people vs FB unleashing a new content ranking algorithm on a quarter of world population) and risk (system to distinguish which cat video I will be shown vs. decisions on employment, insurance, housing, predictive policing). \n\nCould it be an idea to look at case studies at the event, with these questions in mind? For case studies itself, AlgorithmWatch produces yearly reports looking at automated decision-making in Europe (Jan 2019 report, \u2018Automating Society - Taking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU'). UK Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation is also carrying out a review of positive and negative effects of automated decision-making, first interim results just out I think. Interesting examples could be insurance branch, or the case of Austrian labour authority using it to decide whom of the unemployed to help in finding a new job (criterion: efficiency narrowly defined, i.e. those already have highest chance to find a new job in the first place...). \n\nApologies for lengthy post, but it\u2019s my first here, so please cut me some slack :)", "created_at": "2019-10-03 13:58:34.769213", "updated_at": "2019-10-03 13:58:34.769213", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 288, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 47.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [60500], "is_liked_by": [8, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27188, "user_id": 3021, "topic_id": 5193, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Thank you, I gotta read that information thoroughly on a wider screen(Archos here.)\n\n@Naomi : Thx very much.

I suppose that in order to solve a problem, we must first clearly understand its main components, and then from that understanding look for possible solutions, or at least palliatives while we are advancing a possible solution. For that reason I would like to discuss the true nature of power and hierarchies, which are just at the root of the domination game. After this analysis we can begin to outline possible solutions from the common base of our understanding. Then I'll be posting three separate comments, one that will be discussing the true nature of power, another about the true nature of hierarchies, and a third that will be attempting to outline questions that I hope are interesting enough to advance solutions (questions that will be used to guide the <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/living-together-session/mission_case/implementing-real-social-project-case-european-commission\">'Living together' session</a>).</font></font></font>\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-11 10:50:59", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:11.125299", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 232, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29193, "user_id": 330, "topic_id": 1584, "post_number": 18, "raw": "<b>*L\u2019arl\u00e9sienne du brevet europ\u00e9en...*</b>\n\n<b>M.

It's not only that it is caring about God and dealing with, tackling, the basic questions in life that many tend to avoid (and are miserable doing so).

She is a cultural anthropologist studying Internet governance culture. Her PhD presents an ethnographic case study of human rights NGOs working in Internet governance organizations. She is interested in the Internet companies most people have never heard of but use every day and the human rights organizations targetting them to develop \"human rights-respecting\" computer code. Her other research interests include AI governance, digital activism and the politics of emoji design. \n\nPrior to joining the OII, she worked as a policy officer for the digital team of human rights NGO ARTICLE 19 and as a policy advisor for the US House of Representatives. She has an MSc in Social Science of the Internet from the University of Oxford and an MA in International Relations from the University of Utrecht.\n\nIn her spare time she loves coffee, comics and capoeira. \n\n////////\n\nDoes that work for your purposes?", "created_at": "2019-10-07 13:51:27.208503", "updated_at": "2019-10-07 13:51:27.208503", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 188, "wiki": false, "reads": 5, "score": 26.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [60800], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 60757, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 11031, "post_number": 1, "raw": "@augusto\n![10626_2|240x240](upload://kUEvgtrIBixgwOZqhqkewmLtxax.jpeg) \n**Partner**,  **Super Good Life**\nI\u2019m 37 years old and I have a background in cultural management.

I think people's voice need somehow to be heard, direct demogracy is the answer! I really feel touched seeing foreigners to protest with us for our rights and support us in simple ways (like this March) we need this feeling of community and this is why they were so grateful to you. I think you already noticed that\u00a0even in awful situations and times as this one, Greeks never lose their hospitality and their smile. They would always offer you food and drink if they don't have the means :)\n\nSome days ago I got aware of this <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GreeceIamfacingtaxingtimes\" target=\"_blank\">documentary</a>\u00a0by a young Greek guy living and studying in London (friend of a friend). I saw the trailer and seems REALLY interesting and I can also notice that it got also great reputation and critics. \u00a0I am trying to get in touch with him to ask him to share online so I can watch it full but still I didn't hear from him.\u00a0\n\nAnywayz as at the moment I am not living there (but still all of my life is there...) it would be good to get in touch with Lina about Athens' initiatives (she is part of <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/sarcha\" target=\"_blank\">Sarcha</a>) and also for open democracy content I would recommend you to read Lucyanna's report on <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/democratic-utopia\" target=\"_blank\">Democratic Utopia</a>.\u00a0\n\nThank you and Keep in touch :)\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-14 14:13:46", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:26.619701", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 327, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 27962, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 1453, "post_number": 13, "raw": "<b>Encourage responsible participation</b>\n\nStefano, since we last talked this has become much more convincing. What I like most about your approach is the budgeting part in PB: people are playing with figures, and that brings home straight away that policy making cannot be a book of dreams, in which we want everything and don't worry about who is going to pay for it. The lack of the \"who is going to pay up\" question is my main critique to participatory non-budgeting tools like, for example, online consultations based on tools like Ideascale. These tend to be just that, books of dreams: see for example the ongoing one about Italy's digital agenda: http://adi.ideascale.com.\n\nI also like (in principle) your idea that it should be citizens to do a budget and then involve politicians, but I don't see how it could work. The problem, there, is that the initiator cannot really promise to other citizens that their contribution will be taken seriously. I like to say that you can't do government 2.0 without... government: you can do civil society initiatives, but if no institution has a commitment to actually using the participatory budget, the whole think risks using a lot of people's time for nothing.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-02 10:24:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:34.232972", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 219, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 26242, "user_id": 30, "topic_id": 1503, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>I wonder how you'd do...</b>\n\nwith the International Otherhood of Artmonks (it exists!) or similar organizations.

She mixes different formulas of powder and presses them into pills with some big machinery. What I didn't know is that there are people working on night shifts doing vitamins. You know, this blew my mind away. I had no idea that people were buying so many vitamins, to have a huge plant active 24/24 hours, 363 days a year.

They look for answers. They try to find what they should do.\n\nWanting to be happy and reach happiness, this should be the noble goal of every person. The path is the same in every human heart (although many are not aware of it). It is one for all mankind. And this path is leading to one world, one humanity, one happiness.\n\nWhat happens, once happiness has been reached by an individual, a perennial condition of happiness sets in, often called spiritual extasy, or illumination. There is an expansion of the individual consciousness. It creates transports of inexpressible bliss and intensely absorbed state of ecstasy. Better than any sex or any 'normal' physical sensation.\n\nOnce the condition of happiness is reached, one gets '<em>stuck</em>' with it. It doesn't stop. It is constantly there, hour after hour, day after day, year after year.

Such unique individuals become instruments in causing mass upheavals to change the fate of empires and the multitudes under their sway.\n\nCurrently, mankind is at a critical state because a good number of the many leading minds lack some of the essential qualities needed for a balanced evolution.\n\nThe nuclear devices and the present precarious conditions of the world are the grim outcomes of the disproportionately evolved personality of many leaders.\n\nI worry considerably about these issues. But I tell myself that the technological leap to an almost unlimited power of destruction must have been foreseen, somehow.

It is simply better: people like a personal message, and people do not like to be greeted by bots. So we want to create a welcome message that has a human touch, in addition to the automatic e-mail people get when opening their account.\n\nHere are the instructions:\n\n1. **Get the notification about a member signup.** To be notified, you have to first subscribe to the \"[New members on edgeryders.eu](https://edgeryders.eu/t/new-members-on-edgeryders-eu/6710)\" topic. This topic gets a new automatically created post whenever somebody creates a new user account. Use the \"Tracking\" or \"Watching\" notification level, and a notification about that will be included in your regular Discourse notifications, both on the platform and via e-mail.\n\n2. **Wait for a day.** The new member might create a first topic or post right away within the first day and / or fill in profile information, which has two benefits: **\u2460** it allows to discern who signed up via edgeryders.eu and who via biofabforum.org, **\u2461** it gives more inspirations about what to include in the welcome message.\n\n3. **Choose how to write the welcome message.** There are three cases:\n\n    1. **Member posted in the [Biofabrication](/c/biofab) category or one of its sub-categories.** This indicates that the member signed up via [biofabforum.org](https://biofabforum.org/), the first (and so far only) [self-branded platform based on edgeryders.eu](/t/id/8036). In this case, just do nothing \u2013 members signing up via this platform might be confused by a welcome message from \"Edgeryders\". Other users who do not post within the first day could also have come via biofabforum.org, but we have no way to know this (yet).\n\n    2. **Member created a post** (outside of the Biofabrication category)**.** In this case, it is usually better that you write the welcome message as a reply to their post.\n\n    3. **Member did not create a post.** In this case, you should write the welcome message as a \"direct message\" in the edgeryders.eu platform.\n\n4. **Write and send the message.** After a while, you will have created multiple message templates from which you choose by copy & paste. However whenever possible, always adapt the message a bit to make it personal for the people you message. For example, when you know who they are (\"friends of friends\") or if they tell something about themselves in their profile information or previous post, you have a way to react / connect to that. In all cases, welcome them, say something nice about Edgeryders, and also mention that they can message you when they need help :slight_smile:", "created_at": "2018-03-13 17:47:50.574063", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 14:13:11.235041", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 488, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 132.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 58938, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 10703, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Hi Jason, maybe some of the people in the internet of humans conversations can point you in the right direction when it comes to existing activist platforms.

Our urgency to achieve change often unfolds a calculative, strategic mindset; results, rather than process, become primary. Yet a closer look at how life actually lives reveals that means are the ends that we arrive at \u2013 that our points of departure foretell our places of arrival.\n\nThe approach introduced in these five days offers the possibility to understand and work with radically different, more appropriate, more organic approaches to social and ecological process and practice. To work in ways that are respectful of the complexity and true nature of our challenges. Encountering the problems we face in the world today requires the exercise of a responsive creativity premised on our own transformation in the process of engagement. This, we suggest, is built through the disciplined practice of observation as it enters the living processes through which life on earth unfolds. These five days introduce a grounded, aware, engaged and imaginative interpersonal practice.\n\nPratical Information:\nLocation: Set amidst the hills, in a beautiful valley in the heart of Algarve, the Monte Mariposa Retreat Centre will offer the possibility of a deep individual and group immersion.\nhttp://montemariposa.co.uk/\n\nArrivals to Faro (closest airport) are expected on the 5th of February and departures on the 11th of February 2018.\n\nRegistration fee: 650 euros (early bird before 31st of October); 720 euros after that.

The \"two directors rule\" is useless here: if a director is not directly involved in the project requesting the payment, she will typically not know if the payment is legit or not. Payment requests are of the kind \"can you please pay X's bill?\" or \"can you refund Y's plane ticket to Frankfurt?\". Outside of a project framework, there is no way of knowing what the bill or the trip to Frankfurt are for. It is not realistic to expect a random director to take responsibility for this stuff.\n\nI propose we fall back on the project manager. Projects are sovereign in Edgeryders, and with great power comes great responsibility. It could work like this:\n\n**Scenario one: a planned expense comes to maturity**. For example someone delivered something they were meant to. In this case:\n\n1. The project manager receives a bill or a claim for expenses fronted relative to her project. She creates the bill or expense payment claim on FreeAgent (remembering to assign them to her project on FreeAgent too), and uploads any receipts or PDF invoices that go with it.\n\n2. The project manager requests the payment in any way (Matrix, even orally).\n\n3. The person charged with making the payments (for the time being, this will always be a director) checks the budget spreadsheet of the relevant project. They should find an entry to the name of X, or dedicated to a travel budget. They may also find a second column or entry, dedicated to the money already paid to X or spent on travel. As long as the former is there, and the latter is not smaller than the payment requested, the payment can be made without further ado.\n\n4. After the payment is done, the project manager updates the spreadsheet to keep track of how much money she has left to spend.\n\n**Scenario two: an unplanned expense comes up**. This would be requesting a payment for something that is not on the budget spreadsheet. In this case:\n\n\n1. The project manager receives a bill or a claim for expenses fronted relative to her project. She creates the bill or expense payment claim on FreeAgent (remembering to assign them to her project on FreeAgent too), and uploads any receipts or PDF invoices that go with it.\n\n2. The project manager requests the payment with a short post on the platform, in the cat judged most appropriate (normally where the project is coordinated). The post should contain a short explanation (\"I have decided to hire W for a day, as I am trying to build a strategic partnership with her and want to show trust\"), and the indication of where it gets recorded in the spreadsheet. There should be a residual category in the spreadsheet template for this kind of stuff. If the project's resources are all spoken for, the project manager should indicate what other expenses she is going to slash to support the new expenditure.\n\n3. The person charged with making payments need only confirm that the project still has some available funds overall (by looking at the spreadsheet), and can then make the payment.\n\n4. After the payment is done, the project manager updates the spreadsheet to keep track of how much money she has left to spend.\n\nNote that we are duplicating some information: occurred expenditure are being recorded both on the spreadsheet and on FreeAgent. I propose this is provisionally a good thing, as it teaches us sound financial project management and pushes financial responsibility back where it belongs, with project managers. If this turns out to be useless, in the future we might use the spreadsheets for planning purposes only, and use FreeAgent for ex-post monitoring of our finances and project profitability.", "created_at": "2018-06-13 15:05:36.721693", "updated_at": "2019-03-08 00:30:18.456503", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 673, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 97.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38271, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 7415, "post_number": 14, "raw": "where is it @bilal? @DeniseJabbour and @MurielAboulrouss are coming from Beirut, if they know where it is maybe they can bring it along with them?", "created_at": "2017-10-14 08:47:09.923006", "updated_at": "2017-10-14 08:47:09.923006", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 25, "wiki": false, "reads": 32, "score": 31.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [38234], "is_liked_by": [4044], "is_private": false}, {"id": 63261, "user_id": 3908, "topic_id": 11146, "post_number": 30, "raw": "Dear Nadia, unfortunately I dont get your emails.

Another reason is linked to the need of replacing the employed personel that is in vacation and so the new one could, lets say learn more and help more in the office.\n\nSo, to stop this prevailing issue, we have to make aware governments about this problem (maybe they know about it) but being more public and heard by the right persons, in time it should change something.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-09-12 12:58:03", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:25.593399", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 300, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38273, "user_id": 4044, "topic_id": 7180, "post_number": 21, "raw": "Yeah, me too, perhaps at the festival?

It has at least one laptop per team member, and all members have fully understood the instructions for how to do the documenting (see below) Do make sure that someone who is on your team is taking very thorough notes from the discussions. This means: sitting with a laptop and typing, word by word, what different people are saying. It is important to differentiate when different people are saying different things giving each person a codename (their initials, almost like the format for scripts that actors get to learn their characters' lines).\n\n**After the event: Ensure follow up**\n\nPublish a big Call to Action post with what has been agreed at the event, and send a personal message to everyone in which you remind them of the collective mission and direct them to where the documentation is posted online.\n\nWrite a follow up email inviting people to continue to share their stories and that the best stories will be rewarded a storytelling prize.\n\n# The Role of Documenters\nAt each event, documenters ensure that what is being discussed in the group is then uploaded on the community online platform. \n\n**During the event - Instructions:**\n\n* Remind everyone about the purpose of documentation in the beginning\n* Make sure URL for a collaborative document and note taking is visible everywhere in the room (shared google document, titanpad.com or other platforms). Ideally the URL or document is projected on the screen/ wall and accessible to all participants.\n* Reminder during the opening/welcome speech, and ahead of every session that people should contribute and take notes themselves, and give instructions for how. Reminder during checkout, so it&rsquo;s the last thing before everyone leaves the venue!\n* If you use a lot of paper and other materials onsite, make sure to take photos and transcribe everything digitally after the event.\n\n**After the event: Upload documentation**\n\n* Create a +New Topic on the platform for each session. Make the Topic into a Wiki and invite participants to edit or respond/ clarify/ make suggestions in the comments section.\n\n![c1|534x93](upload://yrJ2BLwbHN1DXmk4ki7bzpcJIOO.jpeg) ![c2|597x390](upload://qZ3nApxJZHCb2C1lM6kRriw7XZi.jpeg) \n\n* Refine most relevant content into short blog posts (+New Topic). Blog posts are more edited and high quality than raw documentation. Make sure to include visuals, and ask permission to add people&rsquo;s photographs in the posts. An example [here]( https://edgeryders.eu/t/follow-up-lote4-thoughts-on-stewardship-in-context/3845).\n\n* Remind each participant and community reporters (volunteers) to write one personal summary blog post and post on platform.

Reputable bloggers like Salvatore Aranzulla have given [a cautious thumbs-up](https://www.aranzulla.it/come-funziona-lapp-immuni-1215043.html). \n\nSo why are people like, er, me, still dragging our feet? In my case, it's because of the Manning-Snowden revelation. Everything looks good on the surface, but we now know there is a depth of backdoors, shadowy deals and gigadatabases watched over by three-letter agencies (and their private sector partners). \n\nIn other words: I cannot fully trust Immuni because I cannot fully trust *anything*. That makes me feel a mild irritation, an itch that I cannot scratch. There is really no way out. No hiding from Sauron's Eye. So, I might as well download the app... but my motivation is low, I would be serving even more data on a silver platter (and willingly, ticking the \"I accept the T&C\" box) to a system I cannot believe in. I will still do it... but I need to see a large and immediate gain.

The most common first name among entrepreneurs registered at the Chamber of Commerce in Milano, as of March 2012, is Mohamed.\n\nOther parts of your analysis hold, though. We have a lot of racial hate in Italy. But at least part of it seems to be due to an inferiority complex: the Moroccans, Egyptians and Romanians that flock to the country to start small businesses work hard, know their respective trades and are in their way to do well.

Betweenness centrality is the quality of one node of being part of the shortest path between many pairs of other nodes.

The betweenness centrality of a node (call it N) is given by\n\n<em>[number of shortest paths of N]/[total number of shortest paths in the network, excluding those starting or ending at N]</em>\n\nIn this network, there are 10 paths that do not start or end at the central node, and all 10 go through it. so, the betwenness centrality of the central node is 10/10 = 1. The betweenness centrality of all other nodes is 0 \u2013 you can easily check that by taking one node, for example the one at the top, and verifying that no shortest path between any two of the other nodes goes through the one at the top. The betweenness centrality is always a number between 0 and 1.\n\nIn sociological literature, betweenness centrality is often associated with brokerage and power. This is because, if two individuals interact only through you, you can derive advantages by this, through withholding information or outright lying (\"the other guy says that...\").\n\n", "created_at": "2015-02-27 22:04:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.568868", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 262, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [13080], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23355, "user_id": 931, "topic_id": 1521, "post_number": 10, "raw": "<b>objectivs and assembly model</b>\n\nHi,\n\nthanks for having a look to the thesis (just for clarification, it is a master thesis not a PhD thesis, it is much modest and amateur...)\n\nComenting on your post, well, objectives are not defined, there is not a program or decalogue in the 15M.Blocking evictions, blocking raids against illegal inmigrants,... are the more visual and concrete actions with results. But the objectives, although undefined and variable depending on the indignado you speak to,\u00a0 go much more further, go towards changing subtancially somethings.\n\nThe failure or success of the model of organisation depends a lot on how you see it. Depends on the hurry, the timing is different; depends on where you put the value, in the result or in the process.\n\nOf course, it has all the problems that you mention and more (although the groups are intelligent enough to react to systematic vetos and boycots, moving to wide majorities of 4/5 in some assemblies when consensus couldn't be reached; as well there are continouos change of roles to avoid manipulations or trolls).\n\nBut the 15M can't be understood without the horizontality, materialised through the assembly system.\n\nSome examples:\n\n-it has been easily propagate thanks to this horizontality\n\n-the authorities have problems on fighting against it (the difuse enemy)\n\n-the assembly model matches with one of the main success of the movement: recover the confidence and responsability of the people, recover the feeling of power of citizens, don't let you always dictate what it has to be done, give your opinion, move the political discussion on the street and don't be full of complexes if you are an expert.\n\n-it has been basic to make people involved and to gain momentum.\n\nIt is something to be seen if the decentralised assembly model followed in 15M in Spain can be coordinated in the future for deeper actions, agreement, for building alternatives,... or it will go through a disconnected groups which meet periodically.

This because Discourse hides some elements, including XML tags. So, don't worry if the configuration post does not look right: edit it, then look at it in the edit window, and everything will be there. :+1: \n\n## Make a copy of the example configuration post\n\nIn theory, you can start writing a configuration file from a blank page, but no one does that. Instead, \n\n* Head over to the pre-prepared example configuration post (https://edgeryders.eu/t/resilient-livelihoods-xml/14040).\n* Click on \"edit\". Once in the editor window, select the whole post and copy it.\n* Head back to the topic where you want to park your configuration post, edit it, select all content and paste-replace the example configuration post into it. Next, save. \n\nAt this point, you can already see the first step of the construction of your website. If the topic number of your configuration post is `12345`, a website immediately appears if you type in your browser `https://live.edgeryders.eu/12345`. The content of the website, however, is all wrong: this is because it obeys the example configuration post. In order to make it look more like what you want, you will need, step by step, to change the configuration post. \n\n## Edit the `config` block\n\nWhen you first open the configuration post, look at the top for the `config` block. It looks something like this:\n\n```\n<Config>\nsite:\n  title: Research Network\n  template: campaign\n  theme: research\n  lang: en-US\nheader:\n  image: https://i.redd.it/x5zojh91awfz.jpg\n  social: ['url', 'twitter', 'facebook', 'linkedin', 'email']\nmenu: \n  edgeryders: \n    icon: classic\n    color: #fff\n    url: https://edgeryders.eu\n  other: \n    icon: https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/be232a915d18e16a2b3e17c3d21dc47261e42689.png\n    color: #fff\n    url: https://edgeryders.eu\n  links: \n    anchor: false\n    fade: false\n</Config>\n```\n* Next to `title:`, type the title of your site.\n* Next to `icon:` (under `other:`), copy-paste the link of the icon you want (if any). This you already have uploaded onto Edgeryders during step 2, so it has an address starting in `edgeryders.eu/uploads/`. \n\n\n**All parameters**\n\n| Parameter  | |  Accepted Values |\n|---|---|---|\n| **template**  | |  name of the Vue template to load (can be ignored most cases) |\n| **theme**  | |  name of the CSS theme to load (see [themes](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-an-edgeryders-website-with-the-webkit/13969/6)) |\n| **header**  | |  see header parameters (below) |\n\n### Header parameters\n\n| Parameter  | |  Description | Example |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **image**  | |  url of the image to set as background | https://www.noc.ac.uk/files/images/story/Dan%20Grinwis%20image_.jpg\n| **position**  | |  position of the background image   | 0 -300px (*meaning 300px vertically up, 0px horizontally*)\n| **social**  | | social media buttons to display in the header | ['url', 'twitter', 'facebook', 'linkedin', 'email']\n\n## Edit the `menu` block\n\nThe menu block looks like this:\n\n```\n<Menu style=\"background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(75,137,145,1) 2%, rgba(240,240,240,0) 190%)\">\n## Research Network\n</Menu>\n```\nThere are two things here. \n\n* You definitely want to change the text `Research Network`. It displays to the left of the menu bar: \n\n   ![image|690x289](upload://b1xo02uZNMAnhhTOqtk6onaDJBB.jpeg) \n* You probably also want to change the first line, after `style=\"`. `style` is a general parameter used to control the aesthetics of the block. In this case, we want the `background`of the menu block to be a color `gradient`from one color (the green-grey of the Research Network) to another one (white). To make a gradient from, say the green of #docs:collaboration to white, you would need to write  \n\n```\n<Menu style=\"background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(83,159,68,1) 2%, rgba(240,240,240,0) 190%)\">\n```\n## Edit the `header` block \n\nThe header block looks something like this:\n\n```\n<Header style=\"background: url(https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/5b6f4dd67b8bbca24e1f9b1106c159530b781071_2_1035x621.jpeg); background-position: 40vw -50px; background-attachment: fixed; background-repeat: no-repeat;\">\n<Text>\n## Collective intelligence, at scale {style=\"color: rgba(75,137,145,1)\"}\nWe are the Edgeryders Research Network. We do research with participatory, inclusive methods, to harness the power of collective intelligence.\n</Text>\n</Header>\n```\nTwo things probably need changing. \n\n* The background image. If you want a background image below your header, upload one in your assets post (see [above](/t/13939/3), then put its link in the parenthesis after `background: url`. It should start with `https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/`. Make sure you select one that does not interfere with the text. \n* The text. Just replace the sentences here with your own. Notice that we have made an exception to the rule of having all content in separate topic. This text (\"Collective intelligence, at scale. We are [...]\") is actually written in the configuration topic itself. This is because we have decided to have \"Collective intelligence, at scale\" in one color (green) and \"We are [...]\" in another (black). The webkit can only handle one color in each block, so we have to include the other in a `{style=\"color: ...\"}` instruction. If we put everything in a different topic, it would render incorrectly. \n\n## Choose, arrange and edit the `content` blocks\n\nThere are several types of content blocks. The example configuration post contains at least one block for each type of content you might want. So, the first thing you want to do is look back at your wireframe scheme, and reproduce it in the form of a sequence of blocks. For example, your site might host an \"about\" page; a blog; and a signup form. \n\n* The \"about\" page is just a static text blog.\n* The blog is done by calling all the topics with the #blog Discourse tag. \n* The form is custom-made.\n\nIn this case: \n\n1. Locate the static page `Content` block in the example configuration post. Copy-paste it directly under the end of the `Header` block. **Notice**: the `Header` block ends after `</Header>`. \n2. Locate the Discourse tag  `Content` block in the example configuration post.  Copy-paste it directly under the end of the first  `Content` block, i.e. after its `</Content>`\n3. Do the same thing with the form `Content` block.\n4. Delete all the other blocks, but do not delete the closing tag, `</Webkit>`. \n\nAt the end of this phase, you have a website with the right menu, the right header, the right number and type of blocks. All is left to do is to edit each block so that it does what you want it to do.\n\nHere is how you handle the different types of block.\n\n### The static text content block\n\nThe static text is contained in a post somewhere. This block, then, is simply a call to that post. \n\n```\n<Content id=\"methodology\">\n## Semantic Social Networks\n<Text topic=\"13663/1\"></Text>\n<Text>\n```\nThe `id=` declaration within `<Content [...]>` tells the webkit that this block is called `methodology`. This word shows up in the menu automatically. \n\nThe title of the section (\"Semantic Social Networks\") is written directly in the configuration post for better control over the font, but it could also be in the content topic. \n\nThe `topic` declaration within `Text` says \"take the text from `https://edgeryders.eu/t/13663/1`\". This means that, if you want to change that text, you have no need to edit the configuration post anymore: just head to the normal Discourse post containing the text, in our example  [`https://edgeryders.eu/t/13663/1`](`https://edgeryders.eu/t/13663/1`). You can verify that this post contains the same text that shows up in the websites, under the header \"Semantic Social Networks\".\n\n### Adding a video to the `Content` block\n\nIn any `Content` block, simply add your video (YouTube or Vimeo) URL inside a `<Text>`  tag:\n\n```\n<Text> \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8XYL0gj-R8 \n</Text>\n```\n\n```\n<Text> \nhttps://vimeo.com/video/120778280\n</Text>\n```\n\n### Adding a picture to the `Content` block\n\nThere are several ways to insert pictures into a webkit site: (1) as an **Image View** that will be presented on its own next to or above any other view, (2) inside a text view using markdown syntax, (3) as a background image on any element using custom CSS.\n\n#### 1. Image View\n\nThe simplest way of adding an image would be to put a URL of the image in between an `<Image>` tag.\n```\n<Image>\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/5b6f4dd67b8bbca24e1f9b1106c159530b781071_2_1035x621.jpeg\n\n</Image>\n```\n\nPlacing an image followed by a `<Text>` view in the same `<Content>` block, will present the two side by side:\n\n```\n<Text>\n\nMy text on the left\n\n</Text>\n\n<Image>\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/5b6f4dd67b8bbca24e1f9b1106c159530b781071_2_1035x621.jpeg\n\n</Image>\n```\n\nIt is also possible to set an image url with the attribute `url` as such for a more condensed form:\n\n```\n<Image url=\"https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/image.jpeg\" />\n```\n\n*Important: If you opt for this form, remember to close the tag with a forward slash at the end of the tag.*\n\nYou can apply dimensions to your image (such as width) by adding a `style` attribute to the tag:\n\n```\n<Image url=\"https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/image.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px\" />\n```\n\nThis will set a width of 200px to the image.\n\n#### 2. Inline images\n\nIn many cases, we want to place images within a paragraph of text. To do this, use the Markdown image syntax or HTML `<img>` tag inside a `<Text>` view:\n\n```\n<Text>\n\nFirst paragraph.\n\n![my_first_image](https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/image.jpg) \n\nMore text..\n\n<img title=\"my second image\" src=\"https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/image.jpg\" />\n\n</Text>\n```\n\nIf I want to apply some styling to the image in markdown, I can do so using markdown attributes:\n\n```\n<Text>\n\n![img](www.site.com/image.jpg){style=\"padding: 10px; border: 2px solid gray\"}\n\n</Text>\n```\n\n#### 3. Background Images\n\nFinally I can set a background image on any element using the `style` attribute. This is particularly useful for setting images as backgrounds on a `<Header>` or `<Content>` section:\n\n```\n<Header style=\"background: url(site.com/image.jpg); background-size: cover; background-position: center\"></Header>\n```\n\n### Displaying text and images side-by-side vs. one below the other.\n\nSometimes you will want to render different contents side-by-side, other times arranged in a column. To display them side-by-side, with the text in the left column and the video in the right column, use `---`, like this: \n\n```\n<Content id = \"forum\">\n<Text>\nThis is my text.\n---\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ag-GxG8Uiw\n</Text>\n</Content>\n```\nTo display them in a single column, with the text above the video, close and re-open the `<Text>` tag, like this:\n\n```\n<Content id = \"forum\">\n<Text>\nThis is my text.\n</Text>\n<Text>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ag-GxG8Uiw\n</Text>\n</Content>\n```\n\n### Displaying data from Discourse\n\nWe've seen how to display text from a topic on a site. There are situations, where we want to present multiple topics or posts from Discourse on a site. To do this, we can use **views**. `<Text>` is one view, `<Image>` is another, but we also have `<Table>`, `<Grid>`, `<Slider>`, `<Cards>` and more.\n\nThese components can not only display topics from a tag or category, but any arbitrary set of data provided it is correctly formatted.\n\n#### Table\n\nThe table view presents topics from a tag or category in a table format (and as a list on mobile)\n\n```\n<Table category=\"workspaces\" display=\"date, author\" search=\"true\"  />\n```\n\nThe example above will fetch all topics from the workspaces category.\n\nThe display attribute determines to show the `date` or `author` of a selected item.\n\n\n\n| Attribute  | |  Accepted Values |\n|---|---|---|\n| **category**  | |  *discourse category name* (e.g. '**campfire**' or '**workspaces**')  |\n| **tag**  | |  *discourse tag*  |\n| **data**  ||   *discourse topic id* containing a json array  |\n| **display**  ||   author, date  |\n\n#### Grid\n\nThe grid view presents topics from a tag or category in a grid format (and as a list on mobile)\n\n```\n<Grid tag=\"covid19-event\"  />\n```\n\nThe example above will fetch all topics tagged [covid19-event](http://edgeryders.eu/tag/covid19-event.json).\n\nThe display attribute determines whether to show the `date` or `author` of a grid item.\n\n| Attribute  | |  Accepted Values |\n|---|---|---|\n| **tag**  | |  *discourse tag*  |\n| **display**  | |   author, date  |\n\n#### Slider\n\nThe slider view presents topics from a tag or category in a slideshow format.\n\n```\n<Slider tag=\"edgeryders-summit-conversations\"  />\n```\n\nThe example above will fetch all topics tagged [edgeryders-summit-conversations](http://edgeryders.eu/tag/edgeryders-summit-conversations.json).\n\n| Attribute  | |  Accepted Values |\n|---|---|---|\n| **tag**  | |  *discourse tag*  |\n\n#### Cards\n\nThe cards view presents a row of cards from a tag or category or JSON data inside a topic.\n\n```\n<Cards template=\"topics\" tag=\"webcontent-edgeryders-summit-2020-topics\"  />\n```\n\nThe example above will fetch all topics tagged [webcontent-edgeryders-summit-2020-topics](http://edgeryders.eu/tag/webcontent-edgeryders-summit-2020-topics).\n\nThe template option `topics`, will display the cards as topics.\n\n| Attribute  | |  Accepted Values |\n|---|---|---|\n| **tag**  | |  *discourse tag*  |\n| **template**  | |  topics  |\n\n### Blog\n\nThe blog view presents topics from a tag or category in blog form: title, author, date, and a preview of the full text. \n\n```\n<Blog tag=\"sf-econ-blog\" title=\"Blog\" template=\"standard\" items=\"6\" columns=\"2\" display=\"author, date\"  />`\n\n```\nThe example above fetches the 6 most recent topics tagged #sf-econ-blog, and arranges them in 2 columns. \n\n| Attribute  | |  Accepted Values |\n|---|---|---|\n| **tag**  | |  *discourse tag*  |\n| **template**  | |  topics  |\n| **title**  | |  *string*  |\n| **items**  | |  *integer*  |\n| **columns**  | |  *integer*  |\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Form\n\nThe cards view presents a form with fields for the user to fill in.\n\nTo set up the form a table on AirTable must be created with identical column names matching the ID of each field.\n\n```\n<Form airtable='airtable_base_id'>\n\n### Form Title\n\n### Your City\n\n<Field id=\"city\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"City\" required=\"true\" />\n\n### Your Country\n\n<Field id=\"country\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Country\" required=\"true\" />\n\n### Your Personal Site / LinkedIn profile\n\n<Field id=\"site\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Your Website\" required=\"true\" />\n\n### Your Bio\n\nPlease provide 2-4 sentences about your life experience as it relates to your domain, or anything else you would like to add. (Optional)\n\n<Field id=\"bio\" type=\"textarea\" placeholder=\"Tell us a bit about yourself\" />\n\n</Form>\n\n```\n\nThe example above will display a form and post it to AirTable database with a matching base ID.\n\n| Attribute  | |  Accepted Values |\n|---|---|---|\n| **airtable**  | |  *airtable base ID*  |", "created_at": "2020-06-25 13:02:19.398722", "updated_at": "2020-10-21 13:56:50.242403", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2318, "wiki": true, "reads": 13, "score": 17.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82053, "user_id": 6655, "topic_id": 14245, "post_number": 11, "raw": "**Your name** <br /> sad <br /><br /> **Your email** <br /> sf <br /><br /> **Your motivation or background** <br /> sdfdf <br /><br /> **Which of those categories would best fit you in context with this event?** <br /> teacher <br /><br /> **undefined** <br /> true <br /><br />", "created_at": "2020-08-19 10:20:33.326707", "updated_at": "2020-08-19 10:20:33.326707", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 42, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 6.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24563, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 4452, "post_number": 8, "raw": "<b>Jumpstart etc</b>\n\nYes, jumpstart is pretty big in the open data discussion in Georgia. <a href=\"/user/5634\">@ericnbarrett</a>\u00a0will be able to tell us more.

This would be a whole day workshop including a kickoff talk, creative prototyping and speculative design project presentations following the established model of the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design.\n\nPlan:\n\nRecruit 1 expert on retirement planning for a talk.\n\nSend invitations to groups of students, creatives/unsecured employes and retired citizens.\n\nProgramm will include:\n\n* 1 talk on retirement planning/possibilities/challenges\n* 1 introduction presentation in the methods of speculative design and rapid prototyping\n* 1 inspiration presentation for the speculative brief of DIY retirement solutions\n* Material for quick prototyping\n* Material for proper documentation and presentation\n\n*1-2 Speculative design experts helping with conceptual ideation, prototyping and documentation*\n*If possible would be great if retirement expert could stay for counselling*\n\nParticipants will be teamed up in Generational mixed groups with retired members and the retailers of the future working together.\n\n#\nMotivation:\nThis workshop would provide the young participants both with valuable information for planning their retirement as well as learning about the methods of speculative design and rapid prototyping. It would also encourage intergenerational dialogue and understanding between the retired and young participants and foster the development of new and unconventional ideas through the freedom of the speculative approach.\nThe nature of the prototyping focus will also lead to outcomes that we can present and share easily.\n\n#\nWhat do you guys think? Might there maybe be some budget for material and the expert I would like to invite? (travel costs)\nMaybe we could add another topical motivation like: the best outcome will be presented to lawmakers in the field? \n\nAnd does anyone already know an expert in retirement planning in Stockholm or where I could contact one?

It is a driving force, like wind in the sails, and as such I welcome it.\n\nBut wind will not carry you to port without a good rudder and the will to use it (see, I can do metaphors too). If we decide that the way to go is individual food self sufficiency, guess what? We will probably increase land use. Hunter-gatherers of 50,000 years ago did a lot of ecological damage. The archaeological record in\u00a0Israel, Turkey and Italy reveals that the first modern human beings around the Mediterranean\u00a0switched from eating horses, rhinos, mammoths, bison and tortoises to rabbits, hares, partridges\u00a0and smaller gazelles. Reason: they had largely wiped out the slow-breeding species. Those guys slashed and burned and hunted down game, then they moved on - and this system uses up a lot of land, fast. Switching to farming meant a very considerable decrease in land consumption (99% according to some estimates).\n\nSo, we could start jettisoning the privileges that do weigh on the planet and other human beings. For me the obvious first thing to go is the private car, and all that goes with it (suburban lifestyle, independent houses etc.); the second one is the low cost filght. I may be wrong, but I am quite sure that whatever a sustainable solution might look like it will involve exploiting all the efficiency we can get.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-05 22:58:58", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:12.090852", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 285, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11960], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87541, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 13190, "post_number": 54, "raw": "hmm dunno?

Thank you for that!\n\nI believe that a major concern I myself have around the topic of commons is the way they are communicated about. I have first come across the notion of commons in elementary school and I still clearly remember that nobody in the class got engaged with the topic, as an adult however I can see and experience the harmful effects of ignorance, lack of understanding and individual action. In my community most people have first heard the notion of commons through the Al Gore global warming campaign.\n\nI have been working intensively on advocating rights of oppressed groups living in post-communist countries for more than a decade now. Within the world of the 3rd sector I have seen several charities fail many times trying to convey their beautiful and moving goals and objectives with their campaigns.\n\nAfter several failures I learned that getting a message across to people and getting them engaged in contemporary sociaties is not about what values you represent but how you communicate about them. Governments today are simply not good enough in promoting commons probably for many reasons however three major ones I can see today are the way we learn about them in school,\u00a0the lack of engaging information in the media and the lack of modern promotion/communication skills.\n\nThis is how I got hooked into online marketing and have been assisting non-profits as well as businesses to better engage their audiences. If we had a real understanding of the topic of commons the world would very probably be a better place.\n\nWell, obviously the first round of people to engage are the policy makers we are meeting at the edgeryders' conference.\u00a0But what is it exactly they can help us with and how do we engage them? What would be the desired action on their behalf? Any policy recommendations you already have or is there a source that could be consulted?\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-23 16:54:43", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:44.452423", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 372, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 5.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5635, "user_id": 3074, "topic_id": 5602, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hello,\u00a0\n\nI had a look today at all the currently\u00a0EU-funded research projects which could be related / similar to the opencare approach (care issues, policy-making for citizen empowerment)\u00a0and listed their information.\n\nI thought it could help us in avoiding subjects being too much evoked, but also maybe build some bridges or inspire us.\n\nFor the consortium members having access to our archive, it is stored under the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxnwAmGNB9t9VEJFSFM3NDZOMGs\">opencare admin folder (CORDIS_... doc)</a>\n\nMost funded topics: the elderly, people with diabetes, mental health.\n\nOther topics funded:\u00a0Parkinson or chronic disease(s), HIV\n\n", "created_at": "2016-05-09 15:20:44", "updated_at": "2018-05-26 05:49:18.955478", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 119, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3411], "is_private": false}, {"id": 29278, "user_id": 1935, "topic_id": 2724, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>no bigger picture -waiting for Tbilisi</b>\n\n<span>\u00a0quote @noemi \" there is no bigger plans\"\u00a0 I think this sums everything up .... there is always no big perfect plans just small dots suddenly clustering up to make a bigger picture .</span>\n\n<span>for environmental protests I think Vake park is an exceptional case , as most of them actually fail against the monster of capitalism and real estate development\u00a0 .</span>\n\n<span>I am actually waiting for the event in<span> Tbilisi</span> to meet other people and see other perspectives because actually since 2011 and the revolution and our optimism <span>as<span> Egyptian </span>Youth boosting up to the extreme change of all institutions and reaching a narrative like the one DINA is talking about ,till what we end up with now in a military state and trying to get back to the \"small\" projects or dots trying to keep them alive and so on</span> ,</span>\n\n<span>lately most of the discussions - that i have been involved in - rotates in the same loop we can't think outside it , it is always good to see other perspectives for similar problems , like vake park and the situation that @ericzoetmulder</span>\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-06-05 10:17:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:41.078813", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 293, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 87535, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 13190, "post_number": 53, "raw": "Is it just me or do other also have the feeling that when they edit the main post here with the links for the outreach that it get slower and slower, pointing at discourse having to work rather hard with a very long post?

I think the answer is no, since I just merged Jiri's \"education\" with my \"education\" manually. \n\nIf not (and from what I see in the backend, the answer is likely no), when I merge the codes, does it matter which I choose as the primary \"populism\" (mine or Jirka's)? I am keen to ensure that if I choose mine as the code to be merged into that I do not accidentally delete the Czech translation. EDIT: I tried merging the code \"labour\" and am worried I've lost annotations by doing this...\n\n@Jirka_Kocian and @SZdenek, if you could take another pass at my codebook (like you have in the past) and link any new \"related codes\" you see as equivalent between our two codebooks, I can keep doing this merging. I have made some links on yours as well, so feedback on whether you think they are merge-able would be great (e.g. your \"multicultural environment\" and my \"cosmopolitan\")\n\nAlso, I've split most of your codes still in slash form into English and Czech to make this easier. \n\n(@alberto, looping you in so you can follow this if you want to).", "created_at": "2020-05-29 09:56:06.874634", "updated_at": "2020-10-17 12:05:34.136385", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 387, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 13.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 19332, "user_id": 943, "topic_id": 1531, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Thanks Ginevra - that mission report sounds interesting indeed.

Many community members have written about the difficulties of working from home and uncertainty (@DanicaLacarac), the lack of support for our young generation (@Mila), for mothers and young families (@Pracownica, @matka), and climate action needed (@Arkadiusz). How you see your future at work nowadays?\n\n## The future is here - the transition towards remote work\n\nWe now see that nobody has a job for life anymore: you don\u2019t have one job or a fulltime job your entire career. For the first time in history, we have 5 generations working at the same time, said @joduinn John O\u2019Duinn in his introduction during our event. But the ways in which we work are changing: about 4 in 10 employees in the EU were working remotely this spring ([source](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/report/2020/living-working-and-covid-19-first-findings-april-2020)). There is a new normal and the work culture is changing, even before the AI, the globalized digital economy and other futures of work take over. Covid is said to have accelerated the transformations which were already coming.\n\nBecause of covid19, many companies will not be going back to the offices - and it\u2019s not just digital companies and giants like Twitter, but also service providers are shifting to working digitally. This Portuguese veterinary care online is a good example.\n<br>\n![|480x360](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oGCEGycWgfo/hqdefault.jpg)\n\n*Website at https://www.barkyn.com/.*\n\n<br>\n\nFrom my own little research, there are many benefits coming from not using office buildings as we know them - crowded and concentrated around cities:\n\n* **Economical benefits**: In the US it was calculated that a typical employer can save about 11000$ per year for every person who works remotely half of the time ([source](https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/global-workplace-analytics-in-the-news)).\n\n* **Environmental benefits**: what happens when we don\u2019t have to drive a car to work? Reducing our commuter travel could drastically reduce our carbon footprint. An example from California: cars going to work make for 28% of the state\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-climatechange-california-insight/a-climate-problem-even-california-cant-fix-tailpipe-pollution-idUSKCN1PQ4MJ)). Imagine how our cities could begin to serve their people again and not just be office and pollution hubs.\n\n* **Social benefits:** Even if we are still to find out the exact ways in which remote working affects our interactions, social and family lives, remote working has also been raised as a way to create more inclusive workplaces. Some research suggests that for example women with young children value even more the flexibility brought by remote working.\n\nWork life balance is a difficult thing in any situation: a Eurofound EU survey results reveal that 18% of all workers report working in their free time at least every other day; however, over 1 in 4 workers (27%) who work from home as a result of the pandemic state that they work in their free time to meet the demands of work (at least every other day).\n\n![|624x241](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CtAxZwitUCAj-k5LFMqJdlgcjSTAo2FmaypTh2WXMby4LnfCEbrZ7V1vqUfNAYM6JMTmpY9IkEOtXXye0FMnknWdfTNuK3acNIn69tpV1l-D50qX-Jm1FRpZ5Cg69lsL6vdbCbpf)\n*Image source: Eurofound report (April 2020)*\n\n## What about co-working spaces? Are they well placed to meet this need for healthy workspace, sociality and support?\n\nHere are some key insights from the Edgeryders event with dozens of co-founders and managers of such spaces:\n\nWhile in the early days co-working spaces were mostly the kind of business in real estate, this has changed: It\u2019s not a real estate business anymore, because with social distancing and all, all of the economics of coworking have changed. \n> You\u2019ll probably have to bring in less the number of people in the space\u2026 At least for some amount considering moving by a number of people. I think now it\u2019s time to focus on building the human connection rather than building the space. - @mayursontakke writes about this [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/coworking-has-the-potential-to-be-a-great-equalizer/14034). \nNacho Rodriguez, founder of Coworking and Co-living Canary Islands, makes a similar point:\n\n> I think that more and more communities are going to have to suffer from loneliness, and they are going to need that community aspect.\n\n## Co-working is not only about startups, unicorns, and the digital economy. Nowadays some coworking spaces are focusing on the hyperlocal to meet real community needs\n\nIt seems that the days when co-working spaces were targeting only digital workers or nomadic workers are gone, and there is a shift to meeting more local, or \u2018hyperlocal\u2019 community needs:\n\n* **More local membership.** Some coworking spaces that were trendy for digital nomads are starting to see more local people coming in, due to the travel restrictions: \n> Before the pandemic, 80% of our members were foreigners. Now 80% are Indians. This change has happened in less than 4 months. -says @mayursontakke  \n\n* **More intimate and more social than normal offices:** we are talking about 15-20 seats or more, but likely not hundreds. Within this range, you can actually focus on building a community, make knowledge more accessible for people who want to learn from others, who are also not their bosses.\n\n* **Rural offices:** Another benefit of having a co-working space around is that through 5G, wireless connectivity, it would allow people to work from areas that are more remote. Can we bridge the rural-urban gap by setting up offices in smaller towns or rural areas, connecting them to the Internet and teaching more people how to use it? In India, one of our community members is running skill sharing programs to bridge this divide and create more digital and work equality. In Ireland, the National Association of Community Enterprise Centers (NACEC) are developing quality standards for digitization and climate change and are using co-working as a regional development tool!\n\n> The government also needs to focus on building the ecosystem. Not just spaces, but then encouraging internet service providers to invest and have better networks at such places, or creating some basic facilities [(source).](https://edgeryders.eu/t/coworking-has-the-potential-to-be-a-great-equalizer/14034)\n\n\n* **\u2018Coworking has the potential to be a great equaliser\u2019.** It makes effective remote work possible, by offering access, opportunities, and community. Some spaces are very much pursuing inclusivity: My space managed using social enterprise principles. During this pandemic our beneficiaries (50 children workers) and children of farmers visits our space even more often to access internet because they have to, schools are close and things go online, so now they see the needs of technology, says Asih Murniasih. We also see opportunities for support groups: one co-working entrepreneur has started hosting Virtual Coworking Days to facilitate peer support among women workers: http://womenwhocowork.ie/\n\n## Are co-working spaces going to be better prepared to deal with social distancing/ regulations than the traditional office?\n\nCo-working managers told us they are of course dropping the shared desk, and have hygiene routines in place. But there are also challenges with regulations:\n\nJust look back, and think, how many changes and new regulations have we had over the last three months. If we had implemented, or done things for each of them, we\u2019d be first, crazy, and second, I\u2019d spend a lot of money. For a lot of this, it\u2019s not only for working spaces, it made more sense just to close, and wait until there is some sort of near-reality that they can understand, and know what the new rules are. -@nachorodriguez\n\nWhat is easier to do than larger businesses or organisations is to shift quickly to technological solutions: they are granting and revoking access to the space to anyone in the community 24/7, through an app. This makes it possible for co-working spaces to practically self-manage.\n\n## What do you think about this?

But recently I've tried to work , just to have a first contact with the labour market and to understand what I'd like to do further. Well, I must say that I was extremely disappointed and, during the month I used to work there, I've been asking myself everyday \"What am I doing here?\". The company I've worked for is a huge one, with thousands of employees all over the world, so I thought that I would learn a lot of stuff there.\n\nThe \"problem\" was that I'm completely against the corporatist environment, where every employee is like a little robot, who has to do a lot of things, but he actually doesn't know why he is doing those things. Unfurtunatelly, I believe that this is not just a problem of the company I used to work for, but is a problem of lots of companies, more or less. The huge problem is the perception managers have about those who are on a lower position. Managers sometimes don't know how to motivate people and how to take benefits from employees' ideas or skills.\n\nI think the fact that o lot of people work just because they have to, without any personal contribution on what they are doing, it's a very worrisome reality. We should create a new way of seeing things, a new way of being. We should work for pleasure, do the better we can to be satisfied, ask ourselves: \"why am I doing that task? Why is it important? What can I learn from this?\"\n\nIf we continue being passive, execute orders coming from bosses, it's just fair to be consider like little robots, without personality and without opinions.

The Archetypes the Fool meets and events that befall the Fool on his way result in his personal growth and spiritual transformation. Despite this linear narrative however, the shuffling of the cards, or conscious use, combined with the opportunity for interpretation of the images, allows for multiple narratives and paths to emerge. The cards offer a point of provocation for us to create patterns and pathways for Social Transformation.\n\nMany stories are being told of our future.

It is not made any easier bu the fact that I cannot very well do much without programming. But basically:\n\n1. K-core reductions have a big problem: they tend to generate graphs that are highly connected, and become difficult to read, even for low numbers of nodes. I can see the codes, but visually not really keeping track of which code is connected to which. This is true of all types of K-core reduction.\n\n2. Giatsidis has the opposite behaviour: graphs reduced to a small number of codes tend also to have few edges, and they break down into many connected components. A clear giant component is still visible at ~150 codes, but for smaller ones (~50 codes) the giant component breaks down completely. This is not necessarily a problem. Additionally, it tends to produce trees. This _may_ be a problem, as clearly trees cannot be interpreted as hierarchies of codes, and then you do not really know what you are seeing. Triangles and clusters of triangles help see deep, multi-way relationships.\n\n3. Clique is like Giatsidis, but even more extreme.\n\n4. I have formed an opinion about the qualitative side of the different reduction methods (do they highlight different things?), but I will not share it here, as I do not want to influence Amelia unduly.\n\nSo, here is a suggestion for representing this result in one figure. \n\n* Consider a smaller domain (0-200 nodes, for example). \n* Put your curves onto one single graph\n* Use the same scale for both axis; if this is impractical, draw a reference 45\u00b0 line, the locus where the number of nodes is equal to the number of edges. \n\nThis will show us how different techniques reduce the graph in the relevant domain. Your own work, @melancon, tells us that networks where `number of edges > 4 x number of nodes`  become unreadable.  Ideally, we still want a giant component to emerge, as that will represent the core of the study. This means that the optimal zone is somewhere between 1.1 and 4 edges per each node. \n\nIt would be simple to also make curves depicting the number of connected components vs. the number of nodes for each method. I am not sure what that would teach us, because I am an unsure as to how @amelia would interpret a graph divided into many components.\n\nFinal issue: I think @amelia needs a bit of help in arriving at graphs that she can attempt to interpret.

I was given an 8 minutes time frame, to present the Edgeryders experimental project, which I consider works and delivers good results.\n\nAnother woman was given 8 minutes to talk about her analysis of the tweets of the Canadian federal governments (her message was basically that this gov doesn't tweet much, and the days where occurs major releases of information, like the national budget for instance, the tweeting rate goes down by 89%).\n\nThe rest of the day, guess who talked? Men, men, men, men, men, men, men, men, men, men, men, men, men, and more men. Sometimes, there were panels of 8 men sitting next to each other, replaced by more panels of more men.

I'm continuing to foster connections across our networks in Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco in the hope that we can move slowly forward with a citizen science network in the region regardless of the outcome of the UNDEF funding. For example, I'm here in Medenine for the Social Innovation Camp and already have one young extraordinary female biological engineer now interested in setting up a biohacking lab in the city after two conversations with @noemi and I! \n2. We wait. The UNDEF process is a slow one and should we get shortlisted we'll find out in May or June. This will then see us engage in a deeper scoping and project proposal process when I would certainly be looking to people like yourself for your insights, perspective and expertise.

You've happened upon one of the passages that I was first taught about by my first instructor: the 'sticky feeling'.\n\nAt the practical level, this means to try to keep your blade as near to your opponents as possible as often as possible, as this allows you both to better control the other blade and be able to sense where it is going to go next.\n\nAt the 'speculative' level, the same approach when dealing with a conflict can have great benefits. Keep 'contact' with the thing so that it doesn't get away from you, allowing you to monitor it closely and control it's course/progress where possible.\n\nThe key passage, which is repeated over and over throughout the text, is (paraphrase) 'this should be considered/meditated on long and carefully.' The more you are familiar with the text, and the more you mull over it, the more bits of it will start to 'click' in unexpected areas of life after a while. Sounds faith-y, I know. But in my experience I have found it to work this way.\n\nI cannot help you with regard to keys for songs.

How to develop this potential?\n\nIndividuals create and shape languages to communicate and share experiences, to produce order and assemble other individuals around a common goal.\u00a0 Individuals of higher status can influence or manipulate others by utilizing language.\u00a0 Awareness of complexity is found at different levels in organizations: through words, arguments, and narrative discourse individuals can create new realities from lower to higher levels in organizations. These organizational levels are defined by the degree of influence and control that some individuals have over others.\n\nIndividuals with higher levels of consciousness are able to deeply observe the world, their relation with other individuals and their interaction among organizations. Observation is the first step before we absorb ourselves into the system. When we are able to identify ourselves as a part of a whole we can contribute to or modify the whole, creating new fictions. As a result, we experience evolution of consciousness. \u00a0\n\nObservation, assimilation, transformation, and evolution are defined here as interactive in all levels of the ascending spiral of the evolution of consciousness.\u00a0 These are the conditions that individuals should attain to create new fictions. This difficult task is impeded by the social standards or the cultural center of gravity that acts like a magnet on individual development. If you are below the average level of consciousness it tends to pull you up. If you try to go above it, it tends to pull you down (Wilber, 2000).\u00a0\n\nOnce individuals attain a higher level of consciousness they feel obligated to add to the whole a representative part of their own existence. The creators of fiction have the duty of creating or contributing to the global meaning, or sense, of the whole system, since organizations are created not only to serve a function, but also to achieve transcendence.\u00a0 A meaningful organization is the result of its individual member\u2019s comprehension. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-05 08:21:21", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:39.757753", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 369, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11796], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30414, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 2973, "post_number": 20, "raw": "<b>Emailed you last week</b>\n\nHi @2mavin, thanks for bringing it up, as a matter of fact we're working to set up an overview of the event here:\u00a0/t/futurespotters-event/410\n\nRe: who is participating - anyone who wishes to, but funding is limited so we're inviting most active community members on a rolling basis via email.

I think your emphasis on collaborative culture is a key to protecting against sliding into the continuous conversation mode. \n <br /><br /> **Please, tell us about the best remote work experience you had up to this point: ** <br /> My best remote work experience was on a 2 person team where the responsibilities & decision-making was clearly delineated.

Their attention is being split between work, school, families, & the research project so it becomes difficult to know if they have received necessary information or have made progress on goals if they do not respond or regularly share updates.

And this seems to be a pattern in economics. I remember the outrage I felt when I was an undergrad upon discovering Sraffa's claim that [neoclassical theory determines incorrectly the profit rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_Sraffa#Production_of_Commodities_by_Means_of_Commodities). The model leaves it undetermined, he explained. Of course, in the real world we see a determined profit rate. It follows that it must be determined *outside* the model \u2013 in the world of wielding power to appropriate a bigger slice of the cake. Historical data on profit rates seem to be compatible with a political determination of the profit rate. \n\nMy outrage was because economists saw this, and simply shrugged it off and carried on. And that seems to be a pattern. It goes like this:\n\nNEOCLASSICAL ECONOMISTS: Here's a nice, elegant model. It says that the economy rewards us on the basis of our productivity.\n\nEVERYONE: Nice! But your assumptions are bizarre (Murray Gell-Mann: \"You guys *really* believe that?\"). \n\nKAHNEMAN AND TVERSKY: Yep, assumptions do not stand empirical tests, even in the lab.\n\nPOLANYI: That model never existed, and can never exist. Human societies treat it as extreme dislocation and react by producing fascism.\n\nMAUSS: Hm, interesting. Why is it that people find this thing so unfair and intolerable? And what would a fair model look like? Let's develop one! \n\nKEYNES: Your model leads to disastrous policies.\n\nSRAFFA: Even in pure theory the model is inconsistent. \n\nNEOCLASSICAL ECONOMISTS Lalala we cannot hear you we go right ahead. \n\nNow *this* is unscientific. This is betrayal. It's as if 16th century astronomers had looked through Galileo's telescope and decided to ignore what they saw. Which, actually, they did, and then they got Tycho Brahe proposing an earth-centric cosmos where planets move on all kinds of supercomplicated curves to reconcile observation with the untouchable truth that Earth must not move. So maybe we are in Tycho Brahe economics right now. Certainly [Ole Peters thinks so](/t/12085), and it is hard to argue with his statement that \"if you need to invoke two hundred biases to reconcile your theory of rationality with the data, you probably have a wrong theory and should start over. It sucks for you, but it's how science is supposed to work\".\n\nI am not qualified to judge Graeber's work. I use him as a popularizer: I realized keeping in my head a history of economic thinking perspective helps me, a lot. But, like @atelli here, I see no contradiction between being an activist and doing science: Bertrand Russell and Einstein were activists, and used their prestige to push denuclearization, involving Born, Pauli and others.

When you feel ready, tell your own story to introduce yourself to the community! Use these notes from our discussion at the workshop to help you get started with your own story\u2026\n\n\n**ROUND 1**\n\nTopics discussed\n\n\n\n* **living environment** - how it affects your life, how you live. Working environment. How to raise your family and kids. How this affects the new generation. When you live abroad for many years you come back to your country you feel a gap between you and friends. It's very hard to change the red boundaries, the settings of your mind the values are the same. Every case is a unique case. An individual cannot create a society, it's the society that creates an individual. Eg Yemen, complain about one leader and then you get another one who is also rubbish. Because they are coming from the same environment.\n\n1. It important for the **individual to develop himself** to succeed in life. Maybe he can think of new ventures.\n\n1. **Self respect and self improvement are tied**. If you don't respect yourself you will not improve yourself.\n\n>Sophie :\n struggled in childhood due to lack of self-esteem. You are more comfortable with what you are now and this state of self respect  was due to self improvement.\n\n> Self improvement thought she could do it on her own which is not real. Thus for her the idea of OpenVillage is interesting\n\n> As an introvert didn\u2019t have much self esteem, but after getting outside her comfort zone, decided to change things in her life. This helped her in improving and getting stronger, also swimming helped ?\n\n*  **Access to information and contacts.** We are in a world that is changing very fast, information sources are huge. The genuine information is hard to get, usually you need to check the resources but then validate it by asking people and building contacts in different countries. Information is our target to freedom. Because unless we know what is going on we can hardly know where is our freedom. freedom is the way to value things, if you do not have freedom you cannot see value in things. We have to pass to our next generation, our children, so that they can understand and live with it in their time. Also to teach them how to pursue information and tell us how to live the last 3rd of our lives. We have to have healthy contacts on a social level or we will be robots. For professional purposes we have to have wide and diverse kinds of contacts so we can explore opportunities, build ways of communication for creative issues and for how to move forward in life. If we do not consider information and contacts on the global spectrum I think we will be contained wherever we live and this will affect our freedom\n\n\n\n6. **Mobility**. the idea of freedom of traveling and changing places. So if I am in middle east I can work elsewhere. Meet people and be inspired by them as well as share what you know. Peace of mind- how we can have inner peace in an environment where the future is not known to us, in terms of family in terms of work even stability in the region. All kinds of peace, can we find inner peace or not?\n\n\n>Amro:\n\n>Mobility: idea of loving to travel and out of comfort zone in many countries.like meeting new people and seeing new places, chose jobs with travel opportunities. Been to more Than 30 countries. Learn and inspire people and vice versa. Amazing experience for him.\n\n>Question: instability? \n\n>Agrees that things come with a price, no feeling of a place as home, have friends and family in Jordan, Egypt, Europe. Willing to pay the price. Happy about the term wanderlust, likes travelling and is in his dream job. \n\n>Question: would leave this without a job? \n\n>Seems like a huge risk so maybe not, but if left with no choice, will do this because staying in one place is unacceptable. Go regionally and to other countries if there is a project or training someplace he will go. Was in Denmark and Bangladesh for 1 month, tunisia for 1 week. Ideal length depends on people in the country eg friends, can stay for longer\n\n\n>Amro kamel:\n\n>Peace of mind: facing stress in work, on streets, in family. Does not have but wants to have. \nWants to separate stress at work then go home and not worry about the future. Don't know how to achieve this. Not honest about it previously, only superficially practice eg read about yoga but not active.\n\n> Thinks that when thinking about future can't achieve peace of mind. Engineer, thinks related to logic, thinks worrying about future incongruous with having peace of mind. Eg que sera sera, what happens will happen\n. \n\n>Currently  not convinced about having peace of mind? \n\n>Thinks about job security, ngos depend on funds and if no funds, will not get job. How to have peace of mind if worried about job? Maybe faith not that strong, when think about job and family and not knowing what happens next, Egyptian and not expecting bright future,everything is a potential threat so how to have peace of mind. Needs to sit and reflect on these questions. \n\n>Mobility and peace of mind may be in conflict. Mental and emotional balance may help with inner peace\n\n* I also chose peace of mind and transparency of communication. Peace of mind was shared by Amr. So transparency of communication. With transparency I was concerned or mad that a lot of things happen in this world and later we discover that we didn't know anything about it, all of these big games - that we will be cheated and laughed at in history. I feel so small and why not involved in this thing. I feel frustrated that there is a lot of things happening and I cannot think about it. The most important part is transparency of communication with people around us with friends and family. In egypt is judgemental community so people are afraid to be transparent in case it affects their relationships with others - people fear being judged,. I often feel not supported when I share my fears and insecurities. It affects me and I think it affects society. ( Hadeer )\n\n>Hadeer :\n\n>Peace of mind is very important for me, at certain moment I had this peace of mind , when I return from Colombia to Egypt, I started to worry about the future, I started to ask about what I am working on and what I am doing  , I am working at ICRC I feel judged where I work, and don't have that freedom of making decisions because of work structure.\n\n>My contract will end soon and I m concerned about my next step, so thinking about the future I love that peace of mind.\n\n*  **Self improvement and self respect, Mental and emotional balance**. Shared from my own journey, for me the road was different - self improvement was the way to get to self respect. My own approach to inner peace - accepting that there are things I cannot affect, so if I don't try to control everything then I can adapt.\n\n>Assem ELkahteeb :\n\n>Based on this talk, in order to develope yourself you need to have more self confidence. Your ability to work and produce comes from your self confidence. \n>Then one can make a plan and start working on it from start to beginning. Having a personal inner wellbeing makes you more confident. \n\n\n\n>Sophie :\n\n>In Singapore, as a physician, dealing with patient's death was not easy, she couldn\u2019t stand it or have control, she needed time to understand it, to know how to have more balance. \n\n>This brought a lot of self reflection; why to do that, still striving and working on small related things.\n\n*  **Reflection**. Education and healthcare and goals of sustainable development. Even if you have in good health community it doesn't mean that we will reach a better place, that we will be more productive or innovative or happy. Even if a society has a resources, the individual can be his or her own worst enemy. We always think the human is the centre of the story. Maybe this is the wrong way to see things or judge things.\n\n\n**ROUND 2**\n\n*  **Goals**. If you have a goal, you can have passion and a plan. After that you will learn from your failures.\n\n2. **Funding**. Because I know what i want to achieve, it's just lack of funding and source of funding. In our case because we moved from Yemen and have to start from scratch, this is the main thing. We have already done so many things and know our goals. This war has destroyed our businesses and our lives. \n\n**Feedback**:  in the place I work with Yemeni people in solar. If you want money for doing things in Yemen you need to get it from Saudi (sanduk Malik Salman) or Emirate (Emirati red crescent).\n\n* **Funding**. Any project needs money. You can have many ideas, but without money you will do nothing. Three types: Service projects, trading/commerce, production. Service doesn't need much but the other two you do\n\n4. I work as a trainer for startups so my life is good. People are happy but I am worried about **what happens after training.** Do no harm. When you train females or other vulnerable groups they might fail, so what happens if they don't get funding or meet difficulties with laws or governments or whatever. So I am worried about whether I am helping them or creating false hopes. **How can I make sure that I am not harming those people. Because most businesses fail.** \n\n5. **Passion**. Because even if some of us have ideas but passion dictates how we go about it. If you have passion you have energy. My issue is how to find my passion which areas I can be passionate about\n\n6. **Funding. Taxes**. Any time you try to do anything in Arabic country even if you have money/ are generating revenue you will end up losing money. That why if I want to do something I will do it abroad. **My biggest project is to leave the country.**\n\n7. **Factors for success**. Obstacles against success are the hard thing we need to know. Factors for success are available in books and workshops But the main issue is **factors against success** - if you know them, you can find solutions for how to get around them. \n\nOne example there was startup not submitted to oasis or any other- their value offer was whatever you need I will bring it to you. In no time they closed. A nice lady started a venture in silicon valley called catchy. Similar thing. And in 3-4 months she came to UAE and was very successful. One factor of success was she started in Silicon valley not in Jordan. Second is that she didn't continue in UAE she wouldn't be able to compete- she got support because she was coming from Silicon Valley, she managed to get local funding. In general you have to know what is the obstacles and who your enemies in the market are - then you have to decide whether you will enter the market or if you have to play on a different playground.* Sharing failures and solidarity.\n\n* **Partnership**. What I am thinking about is that I need to have connections into the communities where I would like to work, can give me social or cultural access to the communities. Funding. I want someone to fund my travels because I am traveling to remote communities. I also want to create a team - what I do i always need volunteers.  I have a project. I give workshops to kids to teach them how to turn trash into toys. I believe every child has the right to have a toy. In underprivileged places the you can find trash. I find it's a way to make bridges between people. I managed to give workshop in India, and when I showed them the toys from Egypt it created connection.\n\n*  **Registrations** - put your name in different platforms. How to find the right platform to put your name on- how to pick the right one and when. There are many different places, and times an.

I would narrow it down to three areas and then ask the community to get involved. For example if you have noted that the language of the commons is an important issue, make the case: Based on your experiences why and how is it a challenge ? To whom? Who (which stakeholders) has an interest\u00a0 in addressing it- perhaps there are examples of initiatives where there is some kind of solution or that hint at how things would work if the language of the commons were not a problem? Helene Finidori is interested in the commons and she\u00b4s coming. Maybe other\u00b4s who posted either mission reports or replies in the Caring for Commons campaign might be able to give some good input or help by asking friends to help build the session. We still have a number iof funded travel places left so if people want to help that are not already in Edgeryders there is still room...\n\nThen I would maybe also ask Feel free to ask the social media volunteers to help formulate questions to push out onto the community both on the platform and on e.g. Twitter or FB to get more input and help us flesh out the background to the topic so when we meet in June we have already gotten somewhere in the discussion and can nail it down to concrete proposals together. What do you think- could this work? I would like to review the material myself so we could maybedo this together\u00a0 if you like :)\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-05-25 15:18:31", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:25.340705", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 300, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 40954, "user_id": 3362, "topic_id": 7935, "post_number": 14, "raw": "What an inspiring review!

Common resources are not the same as commons, or dont necessarily have to be commons.\n\n2. Commons deeply ingrains the idea of relationships, practices = commoning, more than the objects of care or resources per se. <em>commons as community</em>\n\n3. The complexity and power of \"property\" and \"rights\" - particularly in terms of access, public/private relations, commodification and the legitimacy issues they pose. How this is framed institutionally and politically has an impact on enabling commoning at policy level or <em>commons as a political paradigm</em>\n\nThanks Helene and apologies, I'm learning and enjoying it :-)\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-03 20:02:08", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:12.712358", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 262, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 15.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 3, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24238, "user_id": 605, "topic_id": 1407, "post_number": 35, "raw": "I am also wondering every day about these questions.. the meaning of life for me is to feel happy and fulfilled which can be achieved also if your daily activities go towards this way, meaning that your \"job\" should be something that motivates you.

Please make any changes there, not here.\n\nhttps://d1ehvogakajzfe.cloudfront.net/cmsAssets/articles/HowtoCode_hero.jpg?mtime=20181030144926\n\n## Big Picture\n--\nWhen we are coding, we need to think about the rigour of the coding system so that others can easily understand and use our codes and the data structure we are producing in the SSNA. This means:\n\n- creating codes that carry meaning, are salient and are essence-capturing when viewed *on their own* \n- defining everything in enough detail and documenting why you chose to use a specific code \n- creating consistent and clear categories so that other ethnographers can easily navigate a large codebook\n- thinking about how someone who has never read any of the underlying data would read and understand the code if they saw it \n- thinking about what meaning the code will carry when it co-occurs with other codes in a visual network\n\n## Coding Conventions\n--\n## Spelling and Formatting \n\nUse British spelling for English-language codes.\n\nUse lowercase letters (unless capitalised letter has semantic meaning, as in a proper noun).\n\nUse accented letters as normal in all languages.\n\n\n## Avoid compound codes \n\nBecause the SSNA detects co-occurrences, it is important that each code carries one meaning, that can then be linked to others. \nFor example, code `homosexuality` and `discrimination` rather than `homosexuality and discrimination` or  `homosexuality:discrimination`.\n\nAs @alberto aptly puts it: \n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:21, topic:13988\"]\n`homosexuality:discrimination` destroys the information that two *separate* experiences are mentioned in the same post. In SSNA, you are supposed to enter two separate codes, `homosexuality` and `discrimination` . The connection between the two is meant to be emergent: if (and only if) many posts mention both experiences, the semantic graph will show a strong connection. Formally, connections between experiences or concepts are represented by edges, not collapsed into nodes.\n\nThe advantage of coding thus is large. Somewhere else in the conversation you could have `discrimination` associated to something else, say `age` . The ego network of `discrimination` will then show you the various aspects of discrimination in the corpus. With double coding, you have to fall back on human memory to rebuild it. \u201cWait, did I not see discrimination elsewhere?\u201d With large corpora and several people coding, this problem becomes more severe. SSNA\u2019s main advantage is scalability, so it is essential to code for that. Your codes are no longer a memory aid for *you* , but a memory aid for the *collective effort* of several researchers plus a computer system.\n[/quote]\n\n## Specificity vs Generality\n\nIf the code does not carry any real meaning on its own (e.g. ` approaches` ), it is too general. \n\nIf the code is too granular to ever be reused (e.g. ` hyperactive mosquitos` ) then it is likely too specific. \n\nSometimes this requires creative thinking. If you're trying to capture the idea that informants are expressing that Romania is more awesome than Poland, the code ` Romania is more awesome than Poland` is likely not going to co-occur in many places (though @noemi might disagree :D ) . However, we could use the code ` country comparison` and co-code it with ` Romania`  and ` Poland`  (or ` Romania-Poland`  if we really felt strongly that we didn\u2019t want to lose that specific country comparison as tied to the country comparison code, though see why we should hesitate to do this in the compound codes section above. We could always go back and copy the code ` Romania-Poland` if we found it was too specific, assigning one instance of all the annotations to ` Romania`  and the other to ` Poland` , so no harm done as long as we keep that more broadly useful ` country comparison` there.)\n\n\n## How many codes to assign?\n\nIt is much easier to merge (and copy) codes than it is to fork them. As a result, aim for greater granularity and merge into a more general concept if you find upon review that the granularity is too small. \n\nIf we code everything ` discrimination`  and realise that we wish we'd coded ` homophobia`  and ` racism`  and ` sexism`  differently, we have to go back and re-read and recode all the annotations assigned to ` discrimination` . If instead we code the other three and decide they are too granular, merging them all into the code ` discrimination`  is easy. If we decide ` homophobia`  is occurring on its own broadly enough but the other two are too granular, we can always merge ` racism`  and ` sexism` into ` discrimination`  but leave ` homophobia`  alone. If we want all of the instances of ` homophobia`  to also be co-coded with the higher-level code ` discrimination` , we can easily copy the code ` homophobia` and merge that second instance into ` discrimination`  so that all its annotations are also coded with the code ` discrimination`. This is what we use hierarchies for in the backend, to more easily keep track of such concepts, as I will return to in the next section.\n\n\n## Code 'that which goes without saying\n\nPart of our job as interpretive analysts is to use our sociocultural understandings and our training to read between the lines. If community members are talking about two concepts explicitly (say `remote working`  and ` e-learning` )  if ` Covid-19` is the context from which this conversation emerges, and the community members are clearly assuming that shared context in their conversations without stating it explicitly, be sure to code it. \n\nCulture is often termed 'that which goes without saying', and part of our job as ethnographers is to explicitly say it. This is especially important in the context of populism, where ` family values` ` traditionalism`  and ` housing policy` might be used to speak about something like ` homophobia` in subtext. \n\n## Code only what has *meaning*\n\nBack to ethnography as an interpretive method. One way not to overproliferate codes is to make sure that a code is only applied if the community member uses the concept *meaningfully*. \n\nFor example, if an event takes place in the United States, but the activities that happened at the event are not meaningfully connected to the fact that the event took place in the United States, in your interpretive assessment, do not apply that code. If, however, the fact that a certain activity happened in Prague (a major city) rather than a rural area, apply the code  `Prague `. Use SSNA thinking here: a co-occurrence network around cities might differ substantially to one around a rural area (certain ideas might be more widely held and repeated in the capital city than in a rural town, for example), which we would want to capture in the SSNA. Code with intention and interpretively. \n\nAs another example, a community member might mention that they are 50 years old. You would only apply the code  `age ` if age was a meaningful frame used by the community member -- if the story was about growing older and life changing, for example. But if the fact is incidental and they go on to talk about  `monster truck racing `, do not apply the code  `age `. \n\n## Three Tiered Invivo System\n\nIf a code is *descriptive* (your term for what informants are describing, or a word that is used in ordinary parlance to refer to the thing you are referring to), use unmarked text. Example: `sustainability` or ` mental health` \n\nIf a code is *invivo* (a directly quoted word or phrase that your informants used that is unique, interesting, or salient as a concept, or does not necessarily fit the 'normal' use of that word) use double quotation marks. Example: ` \"witch\"` , ` \"the East\"`, ` \"punk\"`  \n\nIf a code is *in-between* (a conceptual category used by informants that you are aggregating into a term yourself and/or that does not fit the dictionary or academic use of that term), use single quotes. Example: ` 'communism'` or ` 'patriotism'` \nReason: \n[quote=\"amelia, post:36, topic:13700\"]\nWe are tracing an emergence of codes that are somewhere in between invivo codes and strictly descriptive codes. These are conceptual categories used by informants that differ from the way the same categories are used in the political science literature. For example, @Jirka_Kocian is finding that his informants are using the category \u2018communism\u2019 in specific ways, but ways that differ from the definition as used by political scientists.\n\nThis framework will help us understand meaningful differences between informant conceptual categories (in and across language fora) and academic literature conceptual categories \u2013 and hopefully will let us start an analytical conversation with other partners, particularly the glossary deliverable.\n\n[/quote]\n\n## Hierarchies\n\n\nHierarchies do not appear in the SSNA itself, but we use them to enhance our ethnographic practice. Here are some ground rules. \n\n**Every code in a hierarchy must make sense on its own.** `Discrimination` could be the parent of `homophobia` or `sexism` , but creating a code like `approaches` and nesting it under `discrimination` is a no-go.  \n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:21, topic:13988\"]\n\n\n**Beware false hierarchies** . `Discrimination` is definitely not a child of `homosexuality` . Hierarchies are meant in a proper ontological sense: `cat` is a child of `mammal` , and `France` is a child of `Europe` .\n[/quote]\n\n**You can create null codes to organise codes in the backend**, which will not affect the SSNA. For example, we created the code `geographical location` (with no annotations assigned to it, by using the \"new code\" function in the backend) to nest locations like `Prague`. \n\n**Wait to assign hierarchies / parent-child relations *in the backend* until we do this together** in calls where we analyse the SSNA visualisation alongside this practice, since our hierarchical relationships affect each other. Instead, create categories in your own codebook. We will then discuss them and apply them in the backend together. \n\n\n**Use hierarchies to toggle specificity and generality.** \nLet's return to an example we used above. If we want all of the instances of ` homophobia`  to also be co-coded with the higher-level code ` discrimination` , we can easily copy the code ` homophobia` and merge that second instance into ` discrimination`  so that all its annotations are also coded with the code ` discrimination`. We might do this if we decide that discrimination as a code by itself would co-occur meaningfully with other codes in the SSNA. \n\nHowever, we don't want this to happen automatically, because excessively higher-level codes can end up dominating the graph too much, and may not carry enough meaning on their own to be represented (like `geographical location`, which is a useful organising category but not a very useful SSNA category). We use hierarchies in the backend for different purposes, and not all are worth representing in the SSNA. \n\n\n## Codebook Structure\n\nThe codebook should have three tabs. \n\n### Tab 1\n\nA list of the codes, ordered linearly (in the order that you coded them) with definitions. It is important to have this linear order so that when other ethnographers come to do code review, they can pick up where they left off and easily see new codes. \n\nA minimum viable codebook entry includes:\n\n* Column 1: Code name in source language\n* Column 2: Code name in English  \n* Column 3: Definition of the code\n\nAdditional information can be added: \n* Column 4: Links to related codes (in own codebook or in other ethnographers' codebooks, to suggest merging in future)\n* Using google sheets comment function: Memos about the code (questions for other ethnographers, notes to self) \n\n### Tab 2\n\nSame as the above, but organised alphabetically for clarity. \n\n### Tab 3 \n\nA list of categories and/or hierarchies that organises the codebook. Important for 2 reasons:\n1. So that other ethnographers can easily find similar codes in your codebook to ones in theirs, to suggest merging or to use your code to apply to their dataset. \n2. So that when we come together to create hierarchies in the backend every month, the task is more streamlined. \n\n## Document Everything\n\n\nDefine your codes immediately. \n\nDefine *every code*. I mean *everything*. Even if it seems self-evident. See above on saying \"what goes without saying\". This applies to our own frames as well -- what seems self-evident to one of us will not be self-evident to another one of us. \n\nAssign both English and source language translations in the backend, so the codes are connected. \n\nIf you're not sure about a term or code, note it down and explain why so that others can help you hone it / you can return and refine it \n\nCreate categories in your own codebook as often as possible to help you structure and streamline your codes. I recommend creating these as you code, or at least frequently, to avoid having to do this in a big batch. Doing so makes you less likely to assign different codes to the same concept and have to merge later, since you can see your existing codes more clearly. \n\n\n## Interacting with Other Ethnographers' Codebooks\n\nReview other ethnographers' codebooks at minimum monthly. \n\nCheck if:\n* the code name accurately expresses the definition (is everything in the definition captured by the term used? Is there a more salient or accurate term for what the ethnographer is trying to express in the definition?)\n* the code is too general to carry meaning on its own\n* the code should be broken up into two separate codes \n* the definition/concept is already expressed by another code used in the codebook\n* the ethnographer has asked any questions that you can answer \n* the hierarchies and categories they use in Tab 2 make sense\n\nLeave comments attached to particular cells using the comment function on Google Sheets (right click or \"add comment\"), so that the ethnographer receives a notification when comments have been made \n\nNote any related codes you have in the \"related codes\" tab and make a hyperlink to the cell in your own codebook where the related code is.\n\n*Merging codes.* If you think your code means the same thing as someone else\u2019s (or close enough that you should seek to align them), make a note of it in the related codes tab. Once you discuss the merge with the other ethnographer, merge the codes. Hyperlink the merged code in English to indicate that it is shared across codebooks (on Tab 1 Column 2). Remember to check with the other ethnographer if you want to change the code or its definition.", "created_at": "2020-06-25 18:50:06.212511", "updated_at": "2020-09-14 14:38:54.870997", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 2373, "wiki": true, "reads": 18, "score": 148.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [79442, 78750], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6484, 4, 4794, 6339, 5479], "is_private": false}, {"id": 61444, "user_id": 5423, "topic_id": 10596, "post_number": 4, "raw": "Czy uwa\u017camy, \u017ce na ka\u017cdy temat warto podj\u0105\u0107 dyskusj\u0119, czy jednak chcieliby\u015bmy uruchomi\u0107 co\u015b, co nazw\u0119 na potrzeb\u0119 tej kr\u00f3tkiej wypowiedzi \"zdrowym rozs\u0105dkiem\" i je\u017celi kto\u015b propaguje kompletnie chore systemy i postawy - mo\u017ce jednak chcieliby\u015bmy spu\u015bci\u0107 na to zas\u0142on\u0119 milczenia?

Indem wir Erfahrungen miteinander teilen, verwandeln wir unsere kollektiven Erfahrungen in n\u00fctzliches Wissen, um letztlich damit bessere Entscheidungen f\u00fcr uns und unsere Familien, sowie Freunde, Kollegen und Mitarbeiter zu treffen.\n\nWir glauben dass die politischen und sozialen Agenden von den B\u00fcrgern ausgehen m\u00fcssen, wir brauchen offene Forschungsprojekte, die den Teilnehmenern ebenso M\u00f6glichkeiten zur Mitgestaltung einbringt. Wir stehen daf\u00fcr ein, dass alle unsere Gemeinschaftsprojekte zu konkreten Chancen f\u00fcr unsere Mitglieder f\u00fchren.\n\n## Warum Edgeryders und was hat das mit \"Wellbeing\" zu tun?\n\nWir gehen zusammen auf eine Entdeckungsreise. Sie beginnt hier im Forum an, und f\u00fchrt uns zu Veranstaltungen, Projekten und Gelegenheiten f\u00fcr die engagiertesten Mitwirkenden. Und zwar vor dem Hintergrund der Coronakrise, die wohl weitreichendsten Krise der kollektiven Erinnerung.\n\nDabei kommen wir zu den Wurzeln von Edgeryders zur\u00fcck: Gegr\u00fcndet in der Finanzkrise von 2011, ging es bei Edgeryders von Anfang an um das Zuh\u00f6ren, das Lernen, und das Zusammenwachsen.  \n\nDass wir dabei auf Einfallsreichtum und stellenweise sogar Gro\u00dfz\u00fcgigkeit treffen werden, haben wir zumindest gehofft. Aber wir fanden auch etwas, womit wir nicht gerechnet hatten: ein gemeinsames Gef\u00fchl der Chance. \n\nIn einer Krise wird das Zentrum (der Gesellschaft sowie Institutionen) schw\u00e4cher, weicher, durchl\u00e4ssiger. Gleichzeitig finden sich Menschen am Rand oft mit mehr Handlungsf\u00e4higkeit wieder. Und pl\u00f6tzlich h\u00f6rte man uns zu. Wir versuchten, die Krise als ein Flo\u00df zu benutzen, um uns von der kaputten alten Welt in eine bessere, vern\u00fcnftigere Welt zu tragen.\n\nNat\u00fcrlich muss man in 2020 sagen: Die alte Welt ist noch da. Doch haben wir denen, die mit uns auf dem Weg waren, gemeinsam Neues geschaffen und geholfen, die richtigen Menschen, Ressourcen, und Chancen zu \u00f6ffnen. \n\nSo arbeiten wir z.B. an gemeinschaftlichem open-source Gesundheitswesen, der Evolution des Internets, einem Modellprojekt zum semi-suffizienten Zusammenleben in der Stadt, [The Reef](https://thereef.brussels/), und geben Raum zum Experimentieren mit v\u00f6llig anderen neuen Wirtschaftssystemen, dem [Sci-Fi Economics Lab](https://scifieconomicslab.net/).\n\n## Gemeinsam auf Entdeckungsreise f\u00fcr ein gutes Leben\n\nAls Entdeckungsreise k\u00f6nnen wir noch nicht genau sagen, wohin es gehen wird. Auch werden die Formate sich noch entwickeln - denn wenn wir eines gelernt haben, ist dass es kein echten Zuh\u00f6ren ist, wenn das Ergebnis schon feststeht.\n\nZum Gl\u00fcck haben wir viele Erfahrungen gesammelt, die wir in diesen Prozess einbringen werden, um selbst schwierige Phasen zu meistern. Und durch die Kontakte und Allianzen die wir seit 2011 geschmiedet haben, ergeben sich vielf\u00e4ltige M\u00f6glichkeiten deine Geschichte, Arbeit, Projekt, oder Fragen vorzustellen und oft an die richtige Stelle zu bringen. Unsere Analysemethoden sind wissenschaftlich fundiert und unsere Ergebnisse wurden schon in EU Direktiven 1:1 im Wortlaut \u00fcbernommen. Und unser Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis ist, dass wir mit denen, die unsere Community bilden, so zusammenarbeiten, dass f\u00fcr alle etwas dabei rausspringt - denn nur so kommen wir zu einer besseren Gesellschaft.\n\n## Wie kann ich jetzt mitmachen?\n\n1.

So what should this prompt to action be? \n\n\n1) This post is part of a conversation on .... *depends on the project (e.g NGI and POPREBEL)*\n2) What will come out of it is... **\n3) You access it by leaving a thoughtful comment\n\nAny thoughts on how to best make this happen @matthias @hugi @alberto @noemi @MariaEuler @johncoate @lroddy @stefanoboski ?", "created_at": "2020-06-21 11:58:22.402489", "updated_at": "2020-06-21 12:15:32.579853", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 377, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 273.0, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 2915, 6679], "is_private": false}, {"id": 5845, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 5812, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<h2 class=\"content-section\"><strong>WORK IN PROGRESS DO NOT USE THIS YET!!!!!!</strong></h2>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<hr>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n\n<a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" data-size=\"large\" href=\"https://twitter.com/edgeryders\">Follow @edgeryders</a>\n\n<h1>help us spread the word</h1>\n\n<h1>pick a line and make a tweet!</h1>\n\n(or post it on your blog/facebook/googleplus)\n\n</div>\n\n<h2>Join a team on \\#OPENandChange and complete one task today\u00a0<a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-size=\"large\" data-text=\"Join a team on \\#edgeryders and help prepare a \\#lote session\" data-url=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/making-living-session/mission_case/making-living-and-social-networks\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet It</a>\n\n</h2>\n\n<h2>Save the date for our \\#OPENandChange crowdconference!\u00a0<a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-size=\"large\" data-text=\"At the beginning of the end, or the beginning of a new Europe? \\#lote\" data-url=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/2012/06/at-the-beginning-of-the-end-or-the-beginning-of-a-new-europe/\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet It</a>\n\n</h2>\n\n<h2>@ladyniasan says three things you can do for \\#lOPENandChange this week\u00a0<a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-size=\"large\" data-text=\"@ladyniasan suggests three things you can do for \\#lote this week\" data-url=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/help-build-june-conference/mission_case/boomschakalak-lote-countdown\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet It</a>\n\n</h2>\n\n<h2>Noemi needs help to translate 5 \\#OPENandChange crowdconference\u00a0tweets\u00a0<a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-size=\"large\" data-text=\"Betta needs help to prepare the \\#commons breakout session at \\#lote\" data-url=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/help-build-june-conference/mission_case/i-want-do-more-i-need-support\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet It</a>\n\n</h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"content-section\"><strong>Can you contribute more?</strong></h2>\n\nThank you!

What message does that send about the way that the unMonastery team and a Viral Academy team would work together in the future? I like scrambled eggs. I don't like scrambled projects.\n\nSecondly, an egg shell is pretty strong but too much pressure will make it crack. I agree that the unMonastery needs to adapt to survive in the long term, but i don't think at this stage it would be resilient enough to cope with such a change in its structure, power dynamics and core objectives.\n\nThis leads to the last issue - most people love eggs becuase they are small, simple, well defined and fullfilling. We're already struggling to complete the simplest tasks and the main reason is that they often end up being over-complexified, intellectualised and digitalised to the point where we end up in such a mess that very little action that actually has any impact in the community ends up getting done (without a lot of effort and time). As we're already becoming increasingly overburdeoned with systems that are stiffling our creativity, I'm concerned that the Viral Academy would add another heavy load of complexity without actually adding any value to the community of Matera.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-13 14:14:15", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:59.523117", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 268, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 5.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45688, "user_id": 3904, "topic_id": 8764, "post_number": 13, "raw": "This sounds great and @alberto and I will discuss further.

And it should not be considered as the unique possibility.\n\nDiversified strategies - not putting all eggs in the same basket - are usually more successful than single ideologies.\n\nI see your tool as having a potential to explore possible solutions to global problems. There is a great need for discussions about responsibility, citizen engagement, and many other topics. In many areas, governments are not sure how to go forward to, and how to engage citizens.\n\nThe OpenIDEO platform does a fantastic job at applying a creative process to find design solutions to global problems. Although this is a wonderful platform, I find that it is too oriented toward design to address \u00a0broad social or political problems in an effective way. \u00a0But I like its brainstorming portion of a process. Edgeryders also has a process unrolling through time. Themes are explored, and this leads to a certain degree of convergence, at an event, with possibilities of deliverables.\n\nOne factor for success about Edgeryders is that other than asking participants base their contribution on their personal experience, there is not really a way to go about it. There is no requirement that participants to comply to a strict discipline. Timeless and virtual environments help to discuss about ideas. One can interrupt the conversation and come back at any desired time, to add another layer, or comment, or introduce a different angle.\n\nFinding the right support is a recurring theme raised by the Edgeryders participants. One of the biggest challenge is securing financial support from outside one's own personal network, said researchers Rebecca Collins and Valentina Cuzzocrea (ref, systhesis report).

And that is of course fine -- they are an underappreciated group that could use help, and that help would probably boost not only them, but also the economies of the countries where they live.\n\nSo first I guess I would ask her what is so great about this group, based on her years of study? We know that Grameen Bank and other similar groups have focused on a poorer population that benefits from very small loans. We know that in Brazil there is a program Bolsa Familia (which I didn't get into earlier, but it is another population that is being assisted), and there are other similar programs, which keep the children of poor families in school through direct cash transfers. We know there is a program Kiva which provides small loans from individuals online to very small trader-type businesses, but also for other purposes including education (I have an account with Kiva, for example).  We know the World Bank has identified Small & Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) as businesses that it has targeted to receive subsidized loans to increase the size of their businesses. There are a number of groups and a number of programs. Could she please tell us what is special about the cash-based trader group that makes helping them important?\n\nSecond question is: How does she propose to provide help? Help can be provided at the scale of multinational governmental organizations such as UN agencies, government-to-government assistance such as USAID or the Canadian International Development Agency or any of various government groups, or through NGOs, which might work with national development agencies, or private sector groups such as Rotary International or others, and of course faith-based aid agencies. The pluses and minuses of these organizations are known at this stage. Does she think any of these kinds of organizations might provide the assistance that is needed? Or does she think another model would work better? How would a model she thinks is a good one engage with small-scale traders on the ground?\n\nDoes she have in mind a particular mode of assistance that she thinks is best? Training? Loans or some other form of finance? Cash transfers?\n\nDoes she have in mind a particular place she thinks would be the best place to start? Why?\n\nHas she an estimate of the monetary and other types of benefit that would be achieved by the particular form of assistance she thinks would be optimal as delivered through the modality she thinks best -- for this group (as well as secondary benefits to their children, neighborhood stores, taxes, etc etc.)? Not to put anyone on the spot, but just to get an idea of how worthwhile she thinks her effort would be, because if the benefit is great then I suppose Edgeryders would be especially interested to help.\n\nAnd as far as science fiction is concerned...\n\nThis a small story, about a humble group that works hard to make a life for their families. So no space empires. There must be technology -- transformative fintech? There is really an ideal protagonist in Teresia, the single mother trader in Malaba, Kenya, on the Ugandan border. She hangs her clothes for sale on a tree. I don't know Teresia's background, but that area is home to many Kalenjin people, one of the large ethnic groups of Kenya and Uganda. There is a Kalenjin mythology which could be integrated into a story. The tree could be a \"prayer tree\" -- a medium between the mythological and human spheres. The boy, probably Teresia's son, who looks skeptically into the camera in one of the photos shown in Niti Bhan's TED talk would of course be \"inspired\" with the design of this financial technology, various gods of different local ethnicities would fight over the resources that it creates, etc. So maybe a sci-fi/fantasy of the African sort...", "created_at": "2020-06-26 05:48:22.689728", "updated_at": "2020-06-26 05:48:22.689728", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 673, "wiki": false, "reads": 13, "score": 27.6, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79543, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 13969, "post_number": 1, "raw": "This is a step-by-step guide to making an Edgeryders website with the webkit.\n\n\n# Content \n\n### [Understanding the webkit and why we use it](/t/13969/2)\n\n * Why we need the webkit and when to use it\n* How it works: introducing configuration posts\n\n### [Step 1: Make the design decisions](/t/13969/3)\n\n### [Step 2: Prepare the content](/t/13969/4)\n\n  * Choose and structure a home for your content\n* Make or choose high-quality content\n\n### [Step 3: Prepare the configuration post](/t/13969/5)\n\n   * Make a copy of the example configuration post\n * Edit the `Config` block\n* Edit the `Menu` block\n* Edit the `Header` block\n* Choose, arrange and edit the `Content` blocks\n  * Static text `Content` blocks\n  * Discourse category `Content` blocks\n  * Discourse tags `Content` blocks\n  * Form `Content` blocks\n\n### [Step 4: Finishing touches](/t/13969/6)\n\n * Themes\n* Polish\n* Third-level domain", "created_at": "2020-06-25 09:34:28.684719", "updated_at": "2020-11-06 22:41:31.679832", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 137, "wiki": true, "reads": 16, "score": 68.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 15179, "user_id": 8, "topic_id": 1561, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>The wealth of evidence</b>\n\nhi Bridget,\n\nI think the topics are interesting.

Continuous tremors terrorize all the people and all the Italy are trying to help this piece of land. But the question is: \"how they are trying to help them?!\"\n\nI'm an expert of this situation, because as a voluntary I did the Molise earthquake and Abruzzo eartquake and I saw many problemes during this moments and I would to speak here and in the conference in june (if is possible... :D) to think a way to emprove the situation during this bad moment...\n\nI understand about my experience that one problem of the people is that they lose all the comunication with the rest of the word. many people try to call the friends and parents immediatly after the first tremor and so all the lines are overload. Then after two or three hours all the mobile are dead and so everything need to recharge the mobile and so they need of the electrician.\n\nThen many people call and ask all and nothing because at the beggining there is a lot of panic and confusion.... who ask an house, who ask a bed, who ask to enter own house, who ask where they should to go, who ask to call, who ask where are theyr parents, who ask to eat, who ask the sheets, who ask dress, who ask to speak with the major, who ask to speak with theadministration, the <span><span>firefighters</span></span> and so and so... and all the people have many problems!\n\nSo I thoughtk that the priority is the possibility to call in every time! And so I thought to built a page or a forum but inside the website of the city and this space start oly when there are an emergency. This page could have many pages as the page of the comunications (major, Protezione Civile, doctors, policy, fireflighters, and so and so...), the page to write help about the house, the people, dress, eat and so and so. It will be to have a page with the progects or the events to help. To built a task force to help to rebuilt...\n\nThus my idea was to think a instrument useful to help the cityzens, the administraction, the protezione civile, law enforcement, the firefighters after 5 minuts of the eartquake and also after months of the event,\n\nMany time, after 5 days of the terrible moments, all forget the situation and they abandon these lands... and so la possibility to have every time a site where to work continuosly to help the people for me it will be very right....\n\nThese is only a my idea and if someone would to speak, for me it's ok.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-04 00:36:40", "updated_at": "2017-09-09 06:47:41.777426", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 497, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 15.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 12069, "user_id": 100, "topic_id": 1287, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Innovation et bricolage</b>\n\n\u00a0\n\n<div class=\"yui_3_2_0_45_132713467053871\" style=\"font-family: times, serif; font-size: 12pt; \"><span>Je trouve cette plate-forme OpeIDEO tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante et avec une d\u00e9marche r\u00e9aliste: r\u00e9glons un pb local.

A system of insulin production that is lighter on logistics and more reliant on local production is more robust to external shocks \u2013 an additional advantage to your idea.\n\n", "created_at": "2016-08-27 09:24:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:51.726719", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 154, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 11.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 24707, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 2998, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>How to read the matrix?</b>\n\nI see colored cells, but not all color-codes are clear to me.

Slept over it, and the next day when I read the Italian version I thought \"hm, this will not work for Materani\". I modified it trying to do a mix between what the ER have edited in the past, Noemi's letter, some hyperlinks and what I thought would be important to add in order for local people to understand also what brings you to Matera beyond the unMon and why you want to involve the community. Personally, I think that in general there could be a first elaboration of texts in English so all can contribute; the translation, however, is not only a matter of language - in this case. What I mean by that is that we are not only addressing people who do not speak English, but also who do not know ERs, who have probably never heard of \"Euro hackers\" or don't grasp the sense of \"leveraging creative communities\". However, this is a very precious occasion to spread the word and go on with the contamination process: language has to be direct, simple but also speak to the heart of Materani. Although there are some tangible proofs of conservateurism and resistance to change, I also believe that it is easy to find the way to the local passion, curiosity and interest. So yes, I personally prefer your version in Italian and I think that one should start dispatching the material in English and then, in a second moment, in Italian.\n\nConcerning the video.

Right now, the situation is:\n\n* Ethno coding is done in OpenEthnographer. OE is a piece of our Discourse platform, and so pretty robust. All the ethno data are saved in the same (relational) database as Edgeryders content.\n* Graph analysis is done in GraphRyder. GraphRyder is *not* robust, just a prototype so far. GR does not build graphs directly from OE; it first imports data, and stores it in a Neo4J (graph) database and then builds a JSON version of this data which is stored in memory and served to GraphRyder.\n\nThis wiki is a concept map of important entities in SSNs, and of the relationships linking those entities. The idea is that, by doing this, we set the scene for improving the stack. We might also get ideas to streamline it and make it more robust. \n\n## Logic\n\nWe follow the logic of the graph database. The annotated corpus is represented as a network. This network, however, is more complex than the SSN as proposed by [our paper](https://www.overleaf.com/12648480fhjgndgsbjgz#/48227893/), as it includes more entites (ethnographers, collections) and more relationships.\n\n## Entities\n\nEntities are:\n\n* **Participants**. People who participate in the conversation.\n* **Contributions**. Quanta of content with a unique identifier. In our case, posts on the forum.\n* **Annotations**. Quanta of meta-content, associating contributions to some information created by analysts. \n* **Codes**. Keywords used to assign semantic value to contributions.\n* **Researchers**. Analysts who take part in analyzing the data. \n* **Projects**. SSNA studies: collections of posts that make up ethnographic corpora, and of annotations thereof. \n\n## Relationships\n\n* participant **is-author-of** contribution. \n* contribution **is-reply-to** contribution. \n* annotation **annotates** contribution. \n* annotation **contains** code. \n* researcher **is-author-of** annotation. \n* researcher **is-author-of** code. We might even omit this, given the \"wiki\" nature of codes. On the other hand, different researchers and different studies might want to use the same code in *different* ways. This creates potential for confusion at the human level. How to solve it? \n* annotation **forms-part-of** project.\n\nAll relationships can also be followed backwards: for example \"contribution is-authored-by participant\".\n\nCombining these relationships one gets all other relationships, including the mathematically meaningful ones we use in SSNA proper. For example, one edge in the co-occurrence network in GraphRyder means \"code1 *co-occurs-with* code2\", which resolves in: \n\n> code1 *is-contained-in annotation1, that annotates contribution1, that is-annotated-by annotation2, that contains* code2 \n\nwhen \n\n>*annotation1 forms-part-of project1 AND annotation2 forms-part-of project1* .\n\nA radical approach to Graphryder functionalities would be to simply store the data in Neo4J according to this structure, then use Cypher queries to \"flatten\" the awkward six-mode graph into visually intuitive one-mode graphs. Neo has native layout algos, so visualization should not be a problem. There is also some limited export facilities ([see](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15459615/loading-a-neo4j-subgraph-into-networkx)).\n\n**However, if we do it that way we lose the nice lasso interactor in the Detangler view in Graphryder.**", "created_at": "2019-09-05 11:15:54.807602", "updated_at": "2019-09-05 13:44:23.641528", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 509, "wiki": false, "reads": 17, "score": 90.4, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4022, 1856], "is_private": false}, {"id": 30345, "user_id": 243, "topic_id": 2070, "post_number": 19, "raw": "<b>its already there :)</b>\n\nIt's already there, at the unDojo\u00a0Space :-)\n\nexactly as you say, but at any time :\u00a0\n\n<span>communal activity / group exercise / assembly which focuses on health, togetherness and happiness</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2013-10-24 17:21:44", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:47.121732", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 63, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [30080], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 50135, "user_id": 4773, "topic_id": 9366, "post_number": 1, "raw": "**Challenging populism through culture**\n\nMaria Asavei, Charles University, Prague\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/acc7e356397ed8a65b24f8e81231de900c8ad34e.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"361\">\n\n### Why are you here?\n\nI\u2019m here because I\u2019m deeply interested in how communities produce particular knowledge or clusters of knowledge, which would be difficult to find elsewhere. It is experiential knowledge in the sense that it emerges from interaction with others. I am also interested in the participatory platform as I want to understand how communities work in a truly participatory manner \u2013 how they collaborate as a group and how this can be fostered, while avoiding pre-contested ideas about the definition of populism or why people are attracted to these ideas, for example. Closely connected to this, I\u2019m also interested in more practical aspects \u2013 what participation may entail and how we understand the knowledge of the people; what can we call knowledge in the first place? There is a distinction in my mind between collaboration and participation. Collaboration has to do with interaction and participation is when you have prescribed tasks set by a leader. This kind of participation is not feasible. For me the most effective way to deal with opinions is to have an actual collaborative platform, not participatory in this sense.\n\n\n### What are you interested in?\n\nIntellectually and professionally, I\u2019m interested in the idea of restoring peace and justice. One of the most interesting topics has to do with spirituality, broadly conceived, i.e. the way people long for orientation. This is a very important topic, although people tend to deal with it in a very trivial way \u2013 we should unpack this. I am also interested in art and culture \u2013 POPREBEL is both an academic and practical exercise and has a militant dimension. Ideology as a form of private discussion or engaged discussion has to do with community and communication. It was from this meaning that the idea of ideology slowly developed into something familiar.\n\n\n### What are you struggling with?\n\nI am struggling with many things.

I'll try to explain it more clearly, including some information you already know for completeness. \n\n## Graphryder architecture\n\nGraphryder is a dashboard, a backend API and database. Let's call them GR-client, GR-API and GR-DB. \n\n**GR-client** does all its work in the browser on your machine. It's a static JavaScript app that  runs on your end, and loads data from the GR-API which runs on the same server as GR-DB. It's built completely in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It uses a whole range of libraries, which are all front-loaded when you load the client in your browser. GR-client never talks to GR-DB directly.\n\n**GR-API** is built in Python and does the heavy-lifting to generate data for GR-client. In addition to Python, it has quite a lot of Cypher queries, sent to GR-DB using the python neo4j interface library. It also contains Tulip libraries, used to generate the graphs. GR-API is also responsible for building GR-DB with data from Discourse and OE in the first place. In fact, anyone can trigger a rebuild GR-DB with the latest data from Discourse and OE by simply calling the 'hardUpdateFromEdgeRydersDiscourse' API route from their browser.\n\n**GR-DB** is a Neo4j database with data loaded into it from Discourse and OE. Here is a query result that demonstrates the data structure. I have removed some of the results from the graph for clarity.\n\n![26|690x330](upload://wKwwt9V18f83QmYnoVolh8OgGU.png) \n\n## Graphryder data\n\nWhen GR-client is launched it starts by downloading a lot of data, including [every single post](http://graphryder2.edgeryders.eu/api/posts), [every user](http://graphryder2.edgeryders.eu/api/users) and [every tag](http://graphryder2.edgeryders.eu/api/tags) in the corpus, as well as some other data. These JSON-files are generated by processing data returned by querying GR-DB on demand every time GR-client is loaded in a browser. These JSON files are not cached on the GR-API server but freshly built every time.\n\nIn contrast to the posts, users, and tags, the JSON data containing the graphs is not front-loaded. These are instead built on-demand when the user loads a graph in the client. These are built with Tulip python  libraries included in GR-API, using the available algorithms. [See here for an example of how this data looks](https://graphryder2.edgeryders.eu/api/draw/usersToUsers/FM%5E3%20(OGDF)).\n\nThere are also Tulip files stored on GR-API, used to generate the JSON graphs. These are not generated on demand, but pre-built. They can be re-built with the buttons in the client settings dashboard. Clicking these buttons has no effect on GR-DB, it only triggers a rebuild of the JSON graph files using the data in GR-DB at the time.", "created_at": "2019-09-05 15:41:47.149519", "updated_at": "2019-09-05 16:19:50.550560", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 543, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 27.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [58831, 58832], "is_reply_to": [58831, 58832], "is_liked_by": [4], "is_private": false}, {"id": 23475, "user_id": 61, "topic_id": 1453, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>Participatory deliberations as rejuvenating democracy</b>\n\nThis is brilliant -- One more profound social invention coming out of Latin America's beautiful mix of Liberation theology, serious marxist scholarship and presumably indigenous community practice.\n\nHow can this be made more visible:\n\nsay by building a to-scale version of it into the procedures of the occupy movement?\n\nI'd gladly spend some time on this Stefano... as for your friends the chronic politicians, I'm working on the antidote for that too.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBembo\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-30 10:46:40", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:10.343081", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 98, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 45642, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 8764, "post_number": 12, "raw": "I have the page open and am looking it over.

It has both static and dynamic content in all its right places. Despite this, there are still some steps that you can take to make it easier to access and more professional-looking.\n\n## Themes\n\nMany aesthetical features of your websites are controlled by an external file called a theme. It is part of the webkit software, and lives in the same server. A theme decides, for example, what kind of font the website is going to use. The `Config` block in your configuration post contains a line that tells the webkit which theme to use for your website: \n\n```\n<Config>\nsite:\n  title: Research Network\n  template: campaign\n  theme: research\n  [...]\n</Config>\n```\nYou can try editing that line in the configuration post to see which them  fits best your website. Currently available themes are: \n\n1. `research`: a minimalistic theme developed for the [website of the Research Network](https://research.edgeryders.eu).\n2.  `edgeryders`: the standard Edgeryders theme [see resilience livelihoods website](https://live.edgeryders.eu/resilience).\n\nIf none of the themes fits your needs, talk to the tech team in Edgeryders, they might be able to make one for you depending on their workload. If you feel adventurous, you can also try to develop your own theme: again, talk to the tech team if you wish to do so. \n\n## Polish\n\nThe webkit is made to be used by people who are not web development professionals. However, for particularly ambitious projects, you might need expert help. An example is the 2020 policy summit's website (@hugi please insert link here?). Check with your team leader to make the necessary procurement decisions.\n\nThat said, you can add some polish yourself. For example\n\n\n###  Add a background to a `Content` block\n\nYou can do this by adding a `style` instruction to your block: \n\n```\n<Content id=\"long-termism\" style=\"background: #efefef;\">\n```\nThe color `#efefef`  corresponds to a light grey expressed in hex format. [This](https://hexcolorcodes.org/) is a website where you can pick colors in hex. You can, however, also express colors in other formats, such as RGB.\n\nWhenever you are using `style`, you are giving the webkit instructions in a format called CSS, and must observe the proper syntax. Be sure to copy all the `;`, `:` and `\"`, or the website will not work. More on this [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background.asp).\n\nYou can also add an image as a background: \n\n\n```\n<Content id=\"long-termism\" style=\"background: url('https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/your-image-file.jpeg') no-repeat; background-size: cover;\">\n```\n\nMore on this [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp). \n\n## Third-level domain\n\nYour website lives at `https://live.edgeryders.eu/12345`. That's fine, but we mostly prefer to add a third-level domain to make the URL easier to remember and more snappy looking: something like `https://your-project.edgeryders.eu`. Ask @matthias to make one for you, and point it to your website. \n\nAll done!

This device is designed to address the rising incidence of breast cancer in developing countries where women have limited or no access to breast cancer screening services.\n\nThe test is painless and radiation free, and takes less than 5 minutes to complete. The device can be used by any doctor or health worker and the results are available at the point-of-care.ibreastexam\u00a0assesses differences in tissue elasticity between malignant and non-cancerous breast tissue, and its tactile sensor measures shear stiffness and tissue compression when applied to the skin.\n\nA clinical study\u00a0conducted in India reported that the test maintained high specificity and outperformed an expert clinician who conducted a conventional clinical breast examination. All malignant lesions were identified by the device, while the clinician failed to identify a non-palpable lesion.\n\nUE Lifesciences won the 2016 Hitlab world cup at the Hitlab Innovators Summit in New York for their ibreastexam\u00a0system. This prize is awarded to a healthcare startup deemed to have made an outstanding contribution in improving the delivery and accessibility of healthcare worldwide.\n\nMatthew Campisi, CTO of UE LifeSciences made the following statement:\n\n\u201cWe are truly grateful to have won the HITLAB World Cup and to be part of such a terrific program.

We\u00a0opened an elderly home twenty years ago, but stopped a couple of years ago because the field wasn't interesting anymore. Now\u00a0\u00a0we\u00a0are active on all kind of different levels inside healthcare organizations but we still have a dream to realise a new way of looking at elderly care.\u00a0\n\nWe come from different backgrounds from Africa, mixed cultures, and saw\u00a0how they treat their elderly within the community. We lost that touch with our elderly here in the west, we use the homes a place to bring the elderly, but we we forget they are viable resources for the development of our society. Their knowledge, their experience is a vital organe for society. So why not build more inclusivly we tought?\n\nThat is where we started thinking about a mini city where the elderly home would be in the center, but where families, schools, shops could intertwine with the daily practice of the elderly. Having elderly people in your surroundings is great for the development of a local neighborhood so why don't we finance more project with that in mind?\n\nFor me it is partially because the politics isn't ready in Belgium to start this discussion. People started to have the idea it is ok to bring your elderly to a home, so why brutally change it? But for me it is something politics need to invest now, to experiment and learn about these new methods so we can prepare the future, where the elderly will even be an even bigger number of people if we follow the population piramde of Western countries.\u00a0\n\nI would love to find out if other projects around the world are looking at the same problem, and using more design solutions to reconnect the elderly and their homes with the other generations.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"/t/introducing-openvillage-festival/36\">\n\n<img src=\"/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"85\">\n\n</a>\n\n", "created_at": "2016-10-10 13:14:14", "updated_at": "2018-05-22 08:29:35.724538", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 381, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 30.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11474, "user_id": 79, "topic_id": 1567, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Open gov in UAE and Arab World</b>\n\nThanks Alberto for your time reading my post and commenting on it. I'm glad you found it \"super-interesting\"!\n\nAnd thanks for the sharing the story of Spaghetti Open Data, I've checked it's website and mailing list and I have to say that you guys are doing amazing job! I loved how the group focus on \"delivering\", the OD manual in two weeks! and the public spending website wich is richer and more attractractive than many other government-backed websites.\u00a0\n\nThe story in UAE is a bit different, the OD initiative is initiated by government (a small team within the federal eGovernment where I'm the key datageek and evanglist!). This situation goes in sync with how things work here, government has been always taking the lead and people ( around 8 million, 90% are expats like me) used to expect the government to deliver services that match their needs and expectations. This model has proven its success, but we notice an increasing wellingness from the society to be more proactive and also from the government to be more open and encourage the public to engage in desiging the government policies and programs.\u00a0\n\nAs i said in my post, it's time to leverage this momentum and focus on building up an open data community. Knowing how dynamic UAE and Dubai are, I can see great potential if we managed to succesfully bring togeter the right people and institutions to work togehter.\n\nThe story of Spaghetti Open Data gave me some interesting ideas that are applicable here.\n\nOn the wider scene of the Arab world, yes there are other two official Open Government Data initiatives in Gulf reiong: in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and I've published a paper on this for at the 12th European Conference on eGovernment and will share it here when the proceedings is officially published later this month.\u00a0\n\nBUT the most interesting news are coming from Tunisia where the Arab spring was sparked! the community is playing a major role in the open government movement. I'm following the development there closely, here is my latest post on this:\n\n\u00a0http://ibadawi.com/?p=1215\n\nAnd here is the website of an active community group:\u00a0http://www.opengov.tn/ar/\n\nI hope you find this info useful.\n\nThanks again and would love to hear more from you when meeting you at Strasbourg!\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-06 19:15:49", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:06.158349", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 434, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 10.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 393, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 360, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Living on the Edge (LOTE) is a no-spectator event.

Some of them commented in the threads below the post they created, with only a few active enough to generate multiple posts and remain actively engaged throughout a thread\u2019s life. All activity ended, sadly, around December 2019.\n\nThe respondents inferred demographics: predominantly young people (aged 20-40 something, a few pensioners, seemingly no teens), living and/or working in big cities (some foreign), well-educated, socially sensitive, doing quite well financially with only one or two people who can be said to suffer poverty.\n\nPolitically, among those who declared it, the vast majority of respondents seem to be somewhere in the centre of the spectrum, quite a few are left-leaning (with one radical anarchist), with only a handful right-wing supporters (no radicals found).\n\nAs for the topics, we decided to set the primary cutoff at 20 annotations, which gave us:\n\n* Catholic Church (38 Polish annotations)\n* Inadequate income (38)\n* Big cities (32) (being mostly a piece of metadata)\n* Law and Justice party (31)\n* Emigration (28)\n* Nationalism (26)\n* Need for change (22)\n* Polarisation (22)\n* Low quality healthcare (20)\n* Lack of support (20)\n\nWith the cutoff set at 15 we also got:\n\n* LGBT (17)\n* Provinciality (17)\n* Schooling (17) - to be recoded\n* Mental issues (17)\n* Social support (17)\n* Democratic backsliding (16)\n* Welfare state (15)\n* Political inaction (15)\n* Religiosity (15)\n* Sense of agency (15)\n\nConclusions and preliminary hypotheses\n\n\nThere are three main overarching areas people seem to be particularly concerned with:\n**1. The cardboard state**\n\n**2. Polarisation**\n\n**3. Conservatism and right-wing** concerns, such as the Catholic Church and religiosity as well as nationalism. We also sense critiques of neoliberalism, given that people often talk about inadequate income, low-quality healthcare, and the lack of) affordable housing.. This needs to be further substantiated if a firmer conclusion is going to be reached.\n\n\nTHE CARDBOARD STATE\n\n1. People often complain about living in the so-called \u201ccardboard state\u201d, a state \u201cmade of cardboard and sticks\u201d - a caricature of what a true state should be, a facade with nothing behind it, an entity on the verge of collapse. It shows when people complain of inadequate income (38), low quality of the healthcare system (20), 17 for (lack of) affordable housing, 15 for political inaction, 11 annotations for institutional failure, 13 for democratic backsliding and probably a few more dimensions.\n\nRespondents are tired of struggling, feel despondency (14 annotations), and need for change (22).\n\nThe main concepts that people mention when talking about this need are inadequate income (seems to be one of the main issues in Poland for this demographic), issues with schooling and things related to the ruling party (Law and Justice). Despondency is related to people\u2019s sense of weak agency (sense of agency), considerations of emigration or already being outside of the country. rExpressions of despondency are also liked to fear. Since the vast majority of our respondents are centre/left-leaning it\u2019s no wonder.\n\n![|458x351](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EG3krKBQ6H6evuP_hgrucMAMNb4H6YGJwGAkPQJNVw8i2Yn9kTmfKHeKp7dsB_ws4F3Qgh9cTrgxAiRzrpCtlBWZudmY9cHB04nrTEdyuxMkIxTDVUUL_NFjAuwqlRW3olYmKdlX)\n\n\n![|417x318](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Bb1pLYsMs9YrutsAGgbCRSPf3cizIbHYxsA6QScZy0v689LtYFzl1zATCoB4YzJ6tTuVvYUe6dsp2e6A_5chj7BFlbB2pv_fR1GnKeXBJ-vJaihMaTrwIh3Mc0U47c55ALGpJo6K)\n\nSometimes despondency was reported by social activists, those who tried to induce changes and who fought estranged authorities on changing the housing policy, and inadequate wages. Activists talk about altruism and creating support groups for one another and people from the outside, e.g. in the form of acceptance (as opposed to discrimination).\n\n![|457x333](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jyNokJya97x7CxgESJzu9GfaTPwEKxfUZZJ5RuOvkaxnssPErNZzRmE_eLuItGAFBncffdvs5ioyi0Gv1VjMbwZH0WFP3Exa-vnKGBr4wphe46tAQ6GZ2ro_lQJwK8QSbwEQyWWe)\n\n\n\n2. There are 38 annotations related to inadequate income, which indeed is a problem in Poland, where most recent economic studies show growing economic inequalities and skewed wage distribution (e.g. median and mode are less than half of the mean, and Poland has a high Gini coefficient).\n\n![|442x329](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/I7DXh8GeM_kiTl4bKA5ohp-49z7epgQ5WqV49jXtRL_z4aupPImRs_N4VLh0FhEcQCjIEBhYV4YRrLGqm6Nw1iqj6rk-QoOVK7SEkeOKraF5m6hozKMS0S9VJs6OjtzdEIx7pdep)\n\nLow income families often mentioned the social benefits introduced by the Law and Justice party in 2015 (the infamous 500+, first direct social money transfer in modern Polish history, paid now to each couple for every child they have, until their 18th birthday). Inadequate income is experienced even with people with higher education, and in big cities (our dominant respondents\u2019 demographic), makes them fearful (with low quality of the healthcare system and lack of affordable housing, no wonder) and painfully aware of inequalities in Poland. Some of them, driven by ambition decided to emigrate.\n\n3. Our respondents experience a lack of support (20 annotations), especially in smaller cities (provinciality), where there are fewer support groups, NGOs and activists.\n\n ![|535x346](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LBMFR5VZ84OHNNmqwCvaFWAr07dc3RvA4l2ty2-Ltw6oVhh9vKV2Tw4YcCzmqgMemEnsERYcYqYrtVBOFGN6vk0Qxh5wYEUUgHKiUVByjRbzTVxHifoVtxJzo_lJD_pPD_0wlD7b)\n\nSome of it stems from inadequate income (were their income adequate, they could afford to patch the shortcomings of the cardboard state and its institutional failure using their own means and resources) and results in mental issues.\n\nPOLARISATION\n\n1. Respondents complain of polarisation, especially in the political sphere. Instigated by the ruling Law and Justice party, it stems from dogmatism, breeds hate, affects social cohesion and results in the lack of solidarity. But our respondents believe that a civilised debate (or dialogue) in the search for consensus and peaceful coexistence, together with teaching and spreading tolerance (the opposite of discrimination), pluralism, some form of psychological intervention (\u201cneed for therapy\u201d) may alleviate it (alleviating polarisation). One of the more specific ideas mentioned was organising \u201cliving libraries\u201d. Generally people believe Poles need to start talking to each other.\n\n![|537x424](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/omrE2vP1pt3KASIguhIMXmdQNhxzLzmMzH2PdxvhtvzpW1l-igiYYwzMtakYatYGYlOWSXpv3MogflFZdv02nFHxVQ1F1a6Kt_NrZR1-lyv6FBLTVsppXMS4wJu9-DvM_YpjQCWX)\n\n\n\nBTW recent research shows that supporters of the Civic Platform/Coalition have a much more negative view of \u201cthe other side\u201d and are quite a bit more dogmatic and orthodox.\n\nCONSERVATISM AND RIGHT WING CONCERNS\n\n1. CATHOLIC CHURCH\n\nMany respondents mention the role of the Catholic church in their lives (religiosity, religious upbringing) It has close ties with the ruling party (Law and Justice party), which suggests its politicisation (politicisation) and is mentioned (co-occurs) with a few of the main issues in the Polish community, namely: inadequate income, low quality of the healthcare system and lack of support. It is said to be the defender of traditional values (more often an accusation than a compliment) and a sower of discrimination.\n\n![|535x336](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/53a9keASp7j08G9yuSE-ihEIxtI8OP-hJFWQRJPGPyjKSt_iUZ478OCui8owssqYRMg5BPDiDMAk7xB5fes5FtSOIYi_bLse--XVRhhtZRsGubdqTUQQZTMgzH3gbgNu7KlAEeFy)\n\n\n\n2. NATIONALISM\n\nWith its 26 annotations it\u2019s one of the most salient topics in the Polish community. It prevails in less populated areas (provinciality, as opposed to big cities) and has strong ties with the ruling party. In the context of Poland it\u2019s often directed at the growing Ukrainian minority, engages in violence, but encounters resistance in the form of anti-fascist movements (anti-fascism) and anarchists (anarchism). Quite a few respondents, who by and large suggest that Poles need to start alleviating polarisation by engaging in a form of peaceful dialogue, believe that nationalists should be denied any platform for debate (denying platform).\n\n![|405x336](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uEaI3AGmVC0l8TnOc0-5neX9eZ3YBvd6KnxqUwLrHzINW2P20rB01HmHLEO-hy5CSinspveIOlUQlrvbvmQ0MQFMcmuw3it-38rTlQVCGpulCjx1hckVo9k8C29mxN4CNdE_Dz3r)\n\n\n*\n\nIf our reading is correct, more recent events, the fight about LGBT rights (Margot et. al.), CoVid\u2019s second wave and the disastrous policy of the government, lack of preparations, collapsing healthcare, and the most recent (today\u2019s) ruling of the Constitutional Tribunal against the so-called eugenic premise in the debate about abortion (de facto resulting in a complete ban thereof) may aggravate the cardboard state, polarisation and right-wing issues (at least in our demographics).\n\nAlso it would be great if we somehow managed to attract younger and older respondents (though we have a few 50+ (it seems) and e few pensioners in our midst) and, it\u2019d be super great, if we had more right-wing voters.\n\nThis would give a much broader image, especially on the draw of populism (right wing supporters) and a fresh insight into the lives of people not remembering PPR, communism, and many other things defining our current political landscape (the youth).", "created_at": "2020-10-23 12:51:18.664771", "updated_at": "2020-10-23 13:00:37.684970", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1328, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 26.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6484], "is_private": false}, {"id": 86377, "user_id": 2915, "topic_id": 13292, "post_number": 189, "raw": "Today I think we will know that Trump has lost.

All of these aimed at finding new kinds of functions for the space that perhaps could become self sustaining in the longer run..?\n\nI'm asking because I can imagine how co-working in some rural areas in Europe, particularly East where I come from, would definitely not be able to generate revenue early on, and wouldn\u2019t even have people with the need to cowork per say, but are severely lacking spaces for new contexts for getting together with others.\n\n@Yosser is running a cowork but mostly cultural space in south Tunisia, maybe she has some thoughts after over a year of having set it up?", "created_at": "2020-08-26 05:46:28.906486", "updated_at": "2020-08-26 05:46:28.906486", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 221, "wiki": false, "reads": 12, "score": 22.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [82136], "is_reply_to": [82136], "is_liked_by": [6442], "is_private": false}, {"id": 20761, "user_id": 282, "topic_id": 1567, "post_number": 9, "raw": "<b>The importance of commitment from the highest spheres</b>\n\n18 months corresponds to the exact same number of months that one member of parliament of the government of Quebec has been studying open data and open government principles.

You highlithed a very important issue: the poor engagemnt can be seen also within the open gov community members and activist! So it's an issue that goes beyond poltiicians. I think one reason behind that is the way we (open gov/data\u00a0evangelists) talk to those politicians and various groups. Sometimes, we assume that they look at open gov/data from the same angle as we do and overlook the the fact that they might have different priorities and challenges that might make them see things in a different way.\u00a0\n\nI've always belived that it will be good for open gov/data evangelists\u00a0to focus their resources on answering one simple questions: what is the value that open gov/data can deliver to those differnet stakeholders?\u00a0\n\nI'm sure that there are a handful of policy issues or challenges that politicians, activists, people in the streets and business companies can agree upon as common priorities for all of them.

It reminds me of the late Albert Hirschman, who pretty much founded modern development economics: he believed in something he called \"the principle of social energy conservation\". In his view, once some kind of social capital of mutual trust, recognized interdependence and actioni profiles is established, it tends not to go away, but to migrate from one experience to the next. So, for example, workers involved in union struggles might learn to work together, and use that knowledge to start a cooperative somewhere down the line (Hirschman himself had an example about fishermen).\n\nIt is like the second principle of thermodynamics, but for \"social energy\".

And a lot of resources are spent to put the new network into force. (And are losing the momentum for real change.)\n\nI can explain why this is happening. Politicians (I am a member of the city council of Amsterdam) and government are used to cooperate with legal entities which are easily to define. For example: we know who the members of the board are of a foundation. In the case of a labor union we know the number of registered and paying members. Social networks and online communities can be far more vital and effective than those old organizations but are less clear to define. I think that tools and methods for social networks analysis as you described are very important to get an overview of dominant network and communities to focus on. But it also works the other way round: citizens can make a better selection of the networks they want to join. (Or keep connected to the network they are most used to instead of signing up again for another network.)\n\nIn addition to that I also think we need to pay more attention to digital identity as well. I can have various accounts on one and the same network. I can use my own name for that or can use all kind of fake accounts. For effective citizen participation we need to solve this problem. As a government you want to talk to those networks which exists of members who are willing to identify themselves, not by showing their full name and address in public constantly, but at least at the moment of registration for the network.\n\nI am curious if the problem of digital identity is also tackled within your project.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-08 22:36:32", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:32.774886", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 331, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 85779, "user_id": 4934, "topic_id": 14530, "post_number": 44, "raw": "Hello @Vann, we can not share the whole recording, but we will soon publish a writeup.", "created_at": "2020-10-26 10:23:32.393467", "updated_at": "2020-10-26 10:23:32.393467", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 16, "wiki": false, "reads": 14, "score": 22.8, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [85740], "is_liked_by": [6442], "is_private": false}, {"id": 78890, "user_id": 5429, "topic_id": 13572, "post_number": 11, "raw": "Another update here:\n\n- I've gone through and ripped out the importers and neo4j references in the Graphryder API, and gotten some initial integration requests going through as expected.

However, for the session, I would suggest we focus on the proposal made by Lucas to do some <em>actual</em> resilience, and specifically (since the theme is too vast) how people can deploy an ultralow-cost health care system that does not depend too much on external support in Greece in the worst case scenario of financial meltdown and cutoff of imported supplies which could happen three days after the conference if the hit should really fit the shan in next Sunday's elections. In very bad scenarios, of course, Greece, would just be a forerunner, with Spain, Portugal, Ireland and even Italy going the same way.\n\nWe have a big advantage there: Lucas is a doctor, and he is in charge of pandemic flu planning. If we get a really vicious flu bug that kills millions, his job is to take over the hospital system of the Canary Islands and run it according to some contingency plan.

Not only do our daily lives look different, but parallel to this, the climate change emergency seems more stark than ever. Images emerging of Californian wildfires show what the future may hold.\n\nAt Edgeryders, we have been asking how we can better prepare ourselves for the coming years. We have been analysing new ways local economies may help us as we transition to a green economy.\n\nWe held a webinar, recently, that looked at the local economy of the Messina district in Sicily. It is a really good example of not only how a social enterprise can gain trust among people that have severely distrusted civic institutions, because of a history of organised crime, but also how green energy subsidies could be used in a way that benefited a local community by reducing fossil fuels, reintegrating serious mental health patients into society, spawning several new businesses and providing further funding for the organisation.\n\nIf you would like to read more about how Fondazione Communit\u00e0 di Messina achieved this, you can [read more here and join in our conversation](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-we-can-learn-from-messina-s-economic-model/14424/4).\n\nCoworking has been a major theme for us and the impact the virus has had on the sector. Since running our coworking events during the summer months, we have been asking [what\u2019s the next step for the sector](https://tell.edgeryders.eu/14316)?\n\nAs many countries are now facing their second wave of cases, this may be an even more urgent question. Many of us are balancing family needs and work life while daycare and schools are closed.  In the long term this is unsustainable and will likely lead to burnout. But maybe that's where coworking can come to the rescue. Some spaces are innovating in the sector to offer childcare options to parents that are working remotely. If you have any thoughts on this or would like to join that conversation, please comment [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-two-cs-coworking-and-childcare/14322). \n\nThere are other ways that the sector could help others throughout the crisis too. One of our founding members Noemi has asked if there is a way that co-working spaces are helping freelancers during this period? If your government is supporting work-from-home programmes or has a policy in place, please join the conversation [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/co-working-spaces-can-they-help-employees-and-freelancers-in-the-covid19-world/14200).\n\nIf you\u2019re new to the co-working game, then take a look at some of the tips and advice our members who have been working from the home office for years have [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/remote-work-for-everyone-what-we-stand-to-gain/14192/27).\n\n**Don\u2019t forget...**\n\nOur conversations aren\u2019t only happening on the platform, an NGI Summit will be taking place between [28-29th September exploring an ambitious European vision for the future of the internet](https://summit.ngi.eu/).\n\n**And finally\u2026**\n\nTell us about what\u2019s going on in your part of the world below or [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/status-report-ii-whats-up-with-you/13292/139). Our What\u2019s Up With You?

The main scope of doing a conference session outside is that we as human beings, we\u00a0need nature and light, even in the moments of working on something (see the reason of having bigger windows at work, transparent walls and plants or aquarium).

In order to get informed, I started call friends and the information I was receiving from them was quite different from what I was expecting, expectation that were so different because of having lived in Denmark (2nd most expensive country in the World, right after Norway) and for having thought that there is not possible to be impressed by living costs of other (at least) European country, but of course, CAPITALS ARE CAPITALS!. It took me a few moments to reorder all my mental schemes and to start looking for an apartment.\u00a0\n\nI was lucky enough to be helped by Spanish, French and Romanian friends that were living in Paris with useful links, special social networks, and the results were as they follow:\u00a0\n\n1. February - 2011 I lived in a Spanish friend's, 30 m2 flat. (for free!)\n\n2. March - July 2011 - A French friend helped me renting one of her father's many apartments in Paris, 25 m2 (750 euro/month). I started to look for another apartment given that in this one, winter it would've been quite FROZEN\u00a0\n\n3. August - December 2011 - I found a French guy looking for a flat mate, in his 55 m2 3 rooms apart. (650/month, all included, quite a deal)\n\n4. January 2012 - I lived (for free!) with a Romanian friend in his little tiny flat given for almost one month. I\u00a0was too confident that in one month I would find an apartment (because of the luck I had in the two previous occasions).\u00a0\n\n5. January 2012 - I finally found a nice 30 m2 flat, for me ONLY, BUT starting with March and UNTIL September 2012, I went lived in other friend's house for one month.\u00a0\n\n6. Now September is coming and I will have to move all my stuff FOR THE 7th time in 17th month time.\u00a0\n\nThis is my Parisian Housing adventure until now and it doesn\u2019t stop here!\u00a0 But, it would've been so much hard without all this friends, that other day I helped in different ways.

While using the Internet we want to be free and we want to be safe.\n\n\u00a0It is an old paradox: if we want to be safe, we want everyone to follow some rules and regulations. But at the same time, regulations often seem to interfere with our freedom.\n\nSo what we want to be free from while online, and what would we like to be protected from?\n\nCan we find a common ground for our freedoms and safeties? How can it be put into the policy which is working for all?\n\nThat is what the latest conversations over the internet policy are about: SOPA, PIPA, Anonymous, Privacy, Sharing, Intellectual Property - all these buzz is about combining safety and freedom.\n\nSo what do we have now?\n\nIf I try compare the current situation with politics: internetwise, we seem to get stuck somewhere between anarchy and dictatorship, and we usually feel awkward about both extremes.\n\nTo create a clear and useful proposition for policy, which does make life of humans better it will be a good idea to define very precisely what do we mean by Internet Safety and Internet Freedom, and to see where do we agree, where do we disagree, and what, after all, do we mean by \"We\".\n\nI would like to end my report with a quote from Wikipedia\n\nThe terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used in everyday speech without much distinction. However, the Internet and the World Wide Web are not one and the same. The Internet establishes a global data communications system between computers. In contrast, the Web is one of the services communicated via the Internet. It is a collection of interconnected documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs.[5] In addition to the Web, the Internet also powers a multitude of other services, including (among others) email, file transfer, newsgroups, and online games. On the flip side, Web services can exist apart from the internet, such as on a private intranet.\n\nReferences and suggestions for further reading.\n\n1.

Use it to let the user approve access of your application to their edgeryders.eu user account. Which means, the URL to forward them to for approving the application's access is **NOT** `https://communities.edgeryders.eu/...` but:\n\n```plaintext\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/user-api-key/new\n```\n\nThis is the default mechanism provided by Discourse for authenticating external applications. We should not try to roll our own alternative for this, because we'd have to maintain that for years, and we already know that all authentication related customizations easily break during Discourse updates. We spent three hours looking for other alternatives like JWT based authentication, but there is no ready-made solution for Discourse anywhere. So we'll go with what Discourse provides out of the box.\n\nAs a result, you'll have three cases:\n\n1. If the user does not yet have an edgeryders.eu account, your application uses our custom [`multisite_account.json` API endpoint](https://edgeryders.eu/t/using-the-edgeryders-eu-apis/7904#heading--3-4) as before.\n\n2. If the user as an edgeryders.eu account and is logged into it, your application forwards the user to `https://edgeryders.eu/user-api-key/new` for approving access to their edgeryders.eu account. That takes only a single click, and then the user is forwarded back to your application.\n\n3. If the user as an edgeryders.eu account but is **not** logged into it, your application also forwards the user to `https://edgeryders.eu/user-api-key/new`. From there, the user will be forwarded to communities.edgeryders.eu for login, then back to approve the application, then back to your application. This is obviously annoying, but will happen only in 5% of cases as people typically stay logged in.\n\nYou can (and should) save the resulting `User-Api-Key` value in offline storage into the user's browser. That way, authenticating the application has only to be done the first time the user uses it.", "created_at": "2020-07-28 19:32:12.616446", "updated_at": "2020-07-29 10:03:59.251535", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 352, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 26.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3622], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38212, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 7389, "post_number": 7, "raw": "Understood.

The world slowed down over the past few months, economies grinded to a halt and those who were not \u2018frontline\u2019 workers were ordered to stay inside their homes as public health became a priority.\n\nFor some it was a time of inward reflection. Across the world we saw conversations that were long overdue take place around racism in the US - which has spread to other countries.\n\nDifferent areas of society began to critically evaluate the way in which they have operated and started to challenge things that had been considered \u2018the norm\u2019 up until this point.\n\nOther conversations began to turn to the immediate impact the crisis is having on human behaviour.With more people working from home and depending on software produced by the major tech giants, they have profited throughout the pandemic.\n\nSome have questioned steps taken by governments to control the spread of the virus by using tracing apps that stockpile data on individuals - with commentators such as [Edward Snowden ](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/bvge5q/snowden-warns-governments-are-using-coronavirus-to-build-the-architecture-of-oppression)- saying governments are passing laws totalitarian in nature that will survive longer than the virus itself.\n\nIt seemed like the world was listening.This week at EdgeRyders, we have to ask ourselves if some of these conversations have been forgotten about since the world has begun to hit the resume button. With economies opening back up and workers trickling back to their offices, has the time now passed? Are these conversations a distant memory?\n\nOne of our co-founders [has asked](https://edgeryders.eu/t/germany-introduces-corona-virus-tracing-app-why-arent-people-more-sceptical/13906) why more people aren\u2019t sceptical of the new tracing app the German government has introduced. Edgeryders had a community call recently with experts across Europe who said the technology infringes civil liberties in fighting the virus. Some of those previous conversations can be read [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-results-of-the-community-listening-post-on-risks-for-freedom-in-the-wake-of-covid-19/13183) and [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ethnography-team-reflection-on-a-surveillance-pandemic/13248).\n\nAt Edgeryders we haven\u2019t forgotten conversations around the establishment of a free open-source internet that\u2019s free from big tech interest. Some of our members have been discussing how that looks, with a post this week describing a [new mod](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-do-we-organize-society-for-a-whole-systems-approach-for-developing-the-internet/9766/36)el for book sellers, libraries and online publishers.\n\nWe\u2019re still talking about what the future governance of the internet will look like, with one member [discussing](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-internet-governance/13818/8) Apple\u2019s new data summary label - inspired by nutritional labels on food products - that\u2019s included on each app available to download in the app store.\n\nWe want to [draw your attention](https://edgeryders.eu/t/support-the-movement-for-racial-justice-in-the-usa/13794) to this call from action from one of our EdgeRyders members on how you can help support the movement against police brutality and racism in the US.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nOur session on precarity in higher education took [place last week](https://edgeryders.eu/t/session-on-endangered-researchers-and-precarity-in-higher-education/13414). It\u2019s spurred much conversation on short-term contracts, and low paid wages.\n\nWhile we have transcribed the webinar we held with DeLab on how to interpret data related to Covdi-19. Take a look [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/webinar-making-sense-of-a-covid-19-world-applying-collective-intelligence-to-big-data-3rd-of-june/13537).\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n\n*Video art: Lethe by Sina Saberi*", "created_at": "2020-06-26 09:01:06.686922", "updated_at": "2020-06-26 11:26:04.104878", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 690, "wiki": false, "reads": 23, "score": 164.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 5393, 6425, 3, 347], "is_private": false}, {"id": 18647, "user_id": 5, "topic_id": 2805, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Works now.</b>\n\nIn your first post, you had a trailing whitespace after the link and before the end of line.

Hierarchies are meant in a proper ontological sense: `cat` is a child of `mammal`, and `France` is a child of `Europe`. \n2. **Double codes are bad practice**. `homosexuality:discrimination` destroys the information that two *separate* experiences are mentioned in the same post. In SSNA, you are supposed to enter two separate codes, `homosexuality` and `discrimination`. The connection between the two is meant to be emergent: if (and only if) many posts mention both experiences, the semantic graph will show a strong connection. Formally, connections between experiences or concepts are represented by edges, not collapsed into nodes. \n\nThe advantage of coding thus is large. Somewhere else in the conversation you could have `discrimination` associated to something else, say `age`. The ego network of `discrimination` will then show you the various aspects of discrimination in the corpus. With double coding, you have to fall back on human memory to rebuild it. \"Wait, did I not see discrimination elsewhere?\" With large corpora and several people coding, this problem becomes more severe. SSNA's main advantage is scalability, so it is essential to code for that. Your codes are no longer a memory aid for *you*, but a memory aid for the *collective effort* of several researchers plus a computer system. \n\n@amelia, what's your take here?", "created_at": "2020-06-24 09:00:54.478970", "updated_at": "2020-07-02 12:03:28.233475", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 311, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 33.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [79433], "is_reply_to": [79433], "is_liked_by": [6484], "is_private": false}, {"id": 33164, "user_id": 1487, "topic_id": 1782, "post_number": 52, "raw": "<b>depends on what we want to achieve</b>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>simple cooking rocket stove:\u00a0 approx. 20 firebricks</li>\n\n<li>better cooking rocket stove: approx. 40 firebricks</li>\n\n<li>The \"better\" cooking rocket stove is a good demonstration of the core of heating rocket stove ... though to build a heating rocket stove is much more work and requires more materials including: a metal barrel, chimney pipes, rocks, clay and cob.

In a forest fire, it may be enough if a few teams are interconnected by radio.

It is its own type of parameter, and gets sent with every request to the domain for which the browser has stored the cookie (here communities.edgeryders.eu). The SSO payload return value does not contain the cookie, instead it is directly received by the browser when logging a user in to communities.edgeryders.eu.\n\nWe have configured the server to allow cross-domain use of that authentication cookie. (Like the manual says: \"This only works because we allow cross-domain use of the session cookie via the permit-api-cors plugin.\") So you only have to care about CORS whitelisting and doing a successful SSO login, and the system should care for the rest.\n\nHere's how the process works as a whole:\n\n1. Get your site's domain added to \"CORS allowed origins\" on communities.edgeryders.eu.\n\n2. Initiate a SSO authentication in your JS application, via communities.edgeryders.eu.\n\n3. During SSO login, the user has to enter their username and password on communities.edgeryders.eu. As a result, they get the authentication cookie served from that site. Their browser stores it for domain `communities.edgeryders.eu`, giving them an active session on communities.edgeryders.eu (in addition to the SSO session on other sites via SSO login).\n\n4. From your JS application, send a request to `https://communities.edgeryders.eu/multisite_account_api_key.json`.\n\n5. Since there exists a cookie for `communities.edgeryders.eu`, the browser sends it together with the request automatically.\n\n6. That cookie authenticates your script's request to `multisite_account_api_key.json` and the API call should be successful.\n\n7. The API call returns the user's Admin API key for the requested Discourse forum(s) and can use that to access them from your JS application under the user's account.\n\nIf that does not work, let me know. We tested and confirmed that cross-domain use of the cookie is possible.\n\nFinally, here's a way to get an idea what this cookie actually looks like (though no need to know, as it should be managed automatically): you log in as your normal user @owen to communities.edgeryders.eu and then analyze what the browser sends for authentication, and how:\n\n1. In the Chrome web developer tools, go to \"Storage \u2192 Cookies\" and see what cookies are there in logged-in state.\n\n2. Delete the cookies one after the other to find out which ones are essential for being logged in.\n\n3. You will find that the following cookie is the only essential one (here with a fake value, but it looks like this):\n\n    ```\n    _t:\"d1afe7345cd1f6389a0d2ab7792569\"\n    ```", "created_at": "2020-06-24 14:44:35.410491", "updated_at": "2020-06-24 14:44:35.410491", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 483, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 21.4, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [79271], "is_reply_to": [79271], "is_liked_by": [3622], "is_private": false}, {"id": 81539, "user_id": 3622, "topic_id": 13926, "post_number": 69, "raw": "Good news again :slight_smile:\n\nI've solved the problem by setting the `nonce` parameter as the `topic_id` of the form, which is then included in the returned payload and loads the correct form.\n\nIt now works, hurrah - http://tell.edgeryders.eu\n\nThe last remaining feature to implement is to save the `user_api_key` in local storage so users don't have to re-authenticate again.\n\nIn general terms, this is how it works:\n\n* A private RSA key is read from the .env file\n* The application generates a public key from this, which is included in a url parameter (along with api scopes, nonce, redirect url) to the endpoint `https://edgeryders.eu/user-api-key/new`\n* When the user is sent to this url and authenticates, Discourse sends a payload encrypted with the public key back to the application\n* The application decrypts the payload containing the user API key (using the private key) which is then used to post the topic to the platform\n\nIt sounds a bit simple, but it was a pretty long and windy road to get it working. The upshot of this is it can be used now for many other purposes, we've got a working solution for interfacing with the platform from a front end application.\n\nI have also published [documentation for anyone who needs to set up a form here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/using-edgeryders-forms).", "created_at": "2020-08-07 23:26:12.583458", "updated_at": "2020-08-08 14:20:04.744700", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 232, "wiki": false, "reads": 6, "score": 21.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [81506], "is_liked_by": [5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38120, "user_id": 4088, "topic_id": 7405, "post_number": 3, "raw": "Happy time, full of positive vibes ... such amazing debate \ni really miss that workshop !!

The person that came up with the clearest formulation was perhaps Finnish lawyer Jussi M\u00e4kinnen (not verbatim, I am quoting from my notes):\n> When copyright was invented in the 17th century, lawmakers conjured up a new property right, the right to own something immaterial. They knew it was a bit of a ghost, with little grounds in terms of the legal system of the time, but they wanted a way to reward the creators and their publishers. That, however, created more long-term problems than it solved. So, we have learned from the copyright story that legislating private ownership of personal data is probably a bad idea.\n[/quote]\n\nIngrid Schneider's super-good talk at the same conference went on to list four main proposals around the economic models for a data society. One of them was \n\n[quote=\"alberto, post:1, topic:10893\"]\n+ Individual data ownership + micropayments (Jaron Lanier, 2015).\n[/quote]\n\nBut, as I said, at MyData these ideas seemed to be shrugged off as old and overtly neoliberal, not ideas that a respectable adult can really entertain, and certainly not in Europe. *A fortiori* this should apply to identity, no?", "created_at": "2019-11-07 22:11:50.386440", "updated_at": "2019-11-07 22:11:50.386440", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 261, "wiki": false, "reads": 9, "score": 16.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [59998], "is_reply_to": [63402], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 88638, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 14342, "post_number": 9, "raw": "[quote=\"martin, post:8, topic:14342\"]\nI guess, to learn you need an independent view on the methodology section done by a person that is unfamiliar with technology that you are using\n[/quote]\n\nGood idea.", "created_at": "2020-12-08 16:31:08.458405", "updated_at": "2020-12-08 16:31:08.458405", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 35, "wiki": false, "reads": 7, "score": 1.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 1, "quotes_posts": [88635], "is_reply_to": [88635], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16800, "user_id": 605, "topic_id": 1632, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Hello from my side! \n\nI was</b>\n\nHello from my side!\u00a0\n\nI was hosting the \"?\" table and my experience was similar with the one I have from the online interaction... most of people have the same questions, seeking for the same answers and trying for a better future towards making a living and being happy!\n\nSome of questions that raised during the session were:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>What drives us to find a job?

I am ever more impressed.\u00a0\n\nAs an economist, I would describe what you call a \"gray\" area as a\u00a0<em>nonmarket\u00a0</em>one. Stuff gets done by people who get recognized for what they do. The proof of this in the pudding: you guys survive, get free entertainment, free food, free booze and lots of other freebies. \"Free\" in this context means that no money changes hands, NOT that you don't do anything to earn these things.\u00a0\n\nThe move towards nonmarket economies is indeed a radical one. And yet, I don't agree with your closing statement:\u00a0\n\n<em>we'd like to create positive change but as it currently stands the jobs, institutions and organisations available to us, do not appear to have the frameworks or courage to instigate that change and until they do we're unlikely to build any meaningful allegiances.</em>\n\nHere's why: you don't need to have a theoretical agreement with institutions. They might like what you do with art; or find value in your experiments with a low-cost life, without necessarily buying all of the disruption you attach to them. Who knows, they might even be right! Certainly the strategy of co-opting radical changemakers into creating incremental change instead is centuries old, and very successful so far. The pension system, for example, was introduced by Otto von Bismarck: not a social democrat, but a Prussian militaristic nobleman who despised the masses but feared them enough to make keeping them above subsistence level a high priority.\u00a0\n\nYou can walk some of the way wth some of the existing institutions and organizations, as we have so far with Edgeryders. When we get so far that paths diverge, we will see: but notice that even getting there will be a huge, huge success.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-06-25 21:17:54", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:41.822474", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 336, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 37813, "user_id": 4003, "topic_id": 7350, "post_number": 3, "raw": "[text-direction=rtl]\n\n\u0647\u0649 \u0645\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u0649\u060c \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642\u0629\" \u0645\u0646 \u062d\u0642 \u063a\u064a\u0631\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u060c \u0648\u0643\u0644  \u0645\u0648\u0647\u0628\u0647 \u062a\u0643\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0628\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0647 \u062d\u0642\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u064a\u0631\u060c \u0648\u0642\u062f \u0634\u0627\u0631\u0643\u062a  \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0648\u0643\u0646\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0626\u0632\u064a\u0646\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0629 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642\u0629\u060c https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLcBYl8zTVI&t=43s \u060c \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0648\u0649 \u0641\u0639\u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0643\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0639\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u064a\u0635\u0627\u0644 \u0635\u0648\u062a\u0649 \u0648\u0645\u0648\u0647\u0628\u062a\u0649 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\n[/text-direction]", "created_at": "2017-10-07 12:50:47.669055", "updated_at": "2017-10-07 14:03:33.273949", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 56, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 48.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [1935], "is_private": false}, {"id": 59858, "user_id": 1856, "topic_id": 9821, "post_number": 109, "raw": "This isn't a solution to moving away from the ad-based internet economy, but it surely seems to be a nice niche tool to not having to see those ads (if it at least ensures it can't be detected by the websites):\n\nhttps://edgeryders.eu/t/a-hardware-ad-blocker/10858", "created_at": "2019-09-25 08:52:43.134001", "updated_at": "2019-09-25 09:16:51.766731", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 53, "wiki": false, "reads": 11, "score": 57.2, "like_count": 3, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [59838], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [4, 8, 2915], "is_private": false}, {"id": 52935, "user_id": 4679, "topic_id": 9820, "post_number": 1, "raw": "![pension%203|690x454](upload://wYS4nEANUgpTdPv7ji21ZUxuvqi.png)  After working on pension systems worldwide I believe there must be a better way, which might need to be created.

Some of these ideas I shared in my earlier post. Currently, I am prototyping a voice assistant like Siri that works with colloquial Arabic (e.g. Egyptian, Lebanese, Moroccan, etc.)\n\n- Productivity: I am interested in a lot of ideas related to saving time. Having lived in Egypt and Lebanon, I found that a big portion of my time is wasted due to infrastructure issues. For example, in Cairo a lot of my time would be wasted in traffic, and that\u2019s where the idea that I mentioned in my earlier post on intracity logistics came about. Or, in Beirut, internet connection is both terrible and expensive, and a (perhaps far-fetched) idea that I had was around providing high-speed satellite internet to that region.\n\nWill you make it to Brussels this week?

This however does not mean the houses become \"commons\" in the full sense including ownership - they might just be used like commons for some time. We kinda resolved this by saying \"usage for the common good\" when presenting the results, but there seems to be more to this.\n\nNamely: Knowing too exactly what the commons are and what not might lead us to pass by at opportunities that are similar to commons and useful to society, but not strictly commons. It's the danger of conceptualization: while concepts help to simplify and communicate, reality is always more blurry. And at times, it makes sense to forget concepts for a while and be just pragmatic ... .\n\n(On the other hand,, strong principles also have their place ... cf. Richard Stallman and his Free Software philosophy, leading to countless exclusions of packages from Debian Linux because of small \"licence incompatibility\" issues.

The world slowed down over the past few months, economies grinded to a halt and those who were not \u2018frontline\u2019 workers were ordered to stay inside their homes as public health became a priority.\n\nFor some it was a time of inward reflection. Across the world we saw conversations that were long overdue take place around racism in the US - which has spread to other countries.\n\nDifferent areas of society began to critically evaluate the way in which they have operated and started to challenge things that had been considered \u2018the norm\u2019 up until this point.\n\nOther conversations began to turn to the immediate impact the crisis is having on human behaviour.With more people working from home and depending on software produced by the major tech giants, they have profited throughout the pandemic.\n\nSome have questioned steps taken by governments to control the spread of the virus by using tracing apps that stockpile data on individuals - with commentators such as [Edward Snowden ](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/bvge5q/snowden-warns-governments-are-using-coronavirus-to-build-the-architecture-of-oppression)- saying governments are passing laws totalitarian in nature that will survive longer than the virus itself.\n\nIt seemed like the world was listening.This week at EdgeRyders, we have to ask ourselves if some of these conversations have been forgotten about since the world has begun to hit the resume button. With economies opening back up and workers trickling back to their offices, has the time now passed? Are these conversations a distant memory?\n\nOne of our co-founders [has asked](https://edgeryders.eu/t/germany-introduces-corona-virus-tracing-app-why-arent-people-more-sceptical/13906) why more people aren\u2019t sceptical of the new tracing app the German government has introduced. Edgeryders had a community call recently with experts across Europe who said the technology infringes civil liberties in fighting the virus. Some of those previous conversations can be read [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-results-of-the-community-listening-post-on-risks-for-freedom-in-the-wake-of-covid-19/13183) and [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ethnography-team-reflection-on-a-surveillance-pandemic/13248).\n\nAt Edgeryders we haven\u2019t forgotten conversations around the establishment of a free open-source internet that\u2019s free from big tech interest. Some of our members have been discussing how that looks, with a post this week describing a [new mod](https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-do-we-organize-society-for-a-whole-systems-approach-for-developing-the-internet/9766/36)el for book sellers, libraries and online publishers.\n\nWe\u2019re still talking about what the future governance of the internet will look like, with one member [discussing](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-internet-governance/13818/8) Apple\u2019s new data summary label - inspired by nutritional labels on food products - that\u2019s included on each app available to download in the app store.\n\nWe want to [draw your attention ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/support-the-movement-for-racial-justice-in-the-usa/13794) to this call from action from one of our EdgeRyders members on how you can help support the movement against police brutality and racism in the US.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nOur session on precarity in higher education took [place last week](https://edgeryders.eu/t/session-on-endangered-researchers-and-precarity-in-higher-education/13414). It\u2019s spurred much conversation on short-term contracts, and low paid wages.\n\nWhile we have transcribed the webinar we held with DeLab on how to interpret data related to Covdi-19. Take a look [here ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/webinar-making-sense-of-a-covid-19-world-applying-collective-intelligence-to-big-data-3rd-of-june/13537).\n\n---\nhttps://youtu.be/k5OAjnveyJo\n\n### Join Edgeryders\nSign up [here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/campfire) to: \n* \ud83d\udcac Find the right conversations \n* \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f Get invitations to our events\n* :open_book: Learn & build new knowledge \n* \ud83d\udee0 Co-create new projects and programs\n\n\n\n</Text>\n</Content>\n\n---\n\n<Content id=\"Support our work\">\n<Text>\n\n##  You can help.\n\n**Get in touch.** Edgeryders can support the work of changemakers in more than 80 countries because people like yourself support us with knowledge, contacts and resources.\n\nContact us on [Email](mailto:nadia@edgeryders.eu)  /  [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/JawU61gzONdIftzzvAyvUg) \n\n \n\n\n</Text>\n\n</Content>\n\n---\n\n</Webkit>", "created_at": "2020-06-26 14:20:05.071976", "updated_at": "2020-12-15 19:57:21.984249", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 797, "wiki": false, "reads": 15, "score": 38.0, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 47116, "user_id": 4022, "topic_id": 8998, "post_number": 3, "raw": "[quote=\"alex_levene, post:2, topic:8998\"]\nJust to say @hugi that i'm very much up for some beta testing on this service once things are into a more developed stage.\n[/quote]\n\nDuly noted!

Me?</b>\n\nHi Alberto,\n\nI doubt I've presented an all-out conflict in the session. In fact, my main point there is /precisely/ that the two groups have to learn to talk to each other in a mutually understandable language. Even if the Cryptoanarchy tweet was on the far side of the spectrum (which is precisely the reason I chose it), I do agree that the conversation can be carried out, as long as everyone is willing to listen.\u00a0\n\nThere were, however, those who had no desire to listen. Of course from the point of view of the \"policy makers\" present the session can be considered as a great success and face to face communication with citizens. From no communication at all to pleasantries there is a huge gap. But there were cases (such as Spyros Pengas deflection of the possible collapse of Europe question to a totally unrelated potential employment creation via the Occupy Theatres project presented by Alessia) where the will to listen was just not there.\n\nAs for the economic-based backing of projects, there I was just quoting Emma Toledano, who said exactly that and precisely related to Access Space. Policy makers are people, of course, and people worried about their professional life. And currently that means austerity. There is nothing wrong with that (until there is, of course, which can and probably will happen eventually), but it is a fact.\n\nI do agree that humans on both sides can understand each other, but from what I perceived at the session, the common language is not yet there.\u00a0\n\nThat being said, it is likely my grim outlook on humankind has tinted some of the text...\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-16 11:24:07", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:08.591013", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 298, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 10.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 17584, "user_id": 1141, "topic_id": 1658, "post_number": 4, "raw": "<b>thanx </b>\n\nYeah the salento guys look great! I'll see how it goes this summer with the project, and what possibilities it throws up for future developments. The nature of it is definately inherently collaborative... right now i'm figuring out how to make it happen on 1/4 of the money i initially wanted for it without exploiting all my friends/ other volunteers (probably a subject for the making a living section). But basically it is going to be like a 'pilot' year - we do workshops at local youthcentres to build up/ customize a vehicle,, so its like we bring a workshop to their summer holidays programme,, and then on the day of the big event - at the end of the holidays - we host the big 'grand prix expo' (at the 'interim' estate!) and all the youth centres come represent.. So (this year) not gonna spend weeks installing rollercoaster style structure (!!!), jus focus more on the peeeeple.\n\nIt's funny how failing repeatedly at getting funding (just now relying on the cash that an artist raised from doing a print run) has actually succeeded in focusing the project towards what i know feel is a better place. i initially wrote an arts council application for this, it strikes me that sometimes big lumps of outside funding\u00a0 and the holistic, clearly defined proposals you have to write to get the cash, often eliminate the space for collaborations and negotiations between local groups that can make them feel like they have a stake in the project.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-07-05 09:04:25", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:38.162035", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 262, "wiki": false, "reads": 3, "score": 0.6, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 49774, "user_id": 4792, "topic_id": 9288, "post_number": 10, "raw": "Thanks a lot Raluca!

I believe Jason linearized the scale of the slider. In other words, if the lowest co-occurrence k is 2 and the highest is 15, it would divide the horizontal length of the slider into `15-2 = 3` parts. Then the slider, going left to right, would hide weaker connections linearly. This is all good, except suppose 50% of the edges have `k=2`, 49% `k=14` and 1% `k=15`. Then your first move to the right would hide the 50%. Then, as you slide further tight, nothing happens until the very end, when suddenly the other 49% disappear. \n\nA better system is to program the slider so that it orders the unique values of k. In the example above, the length of the slider would only be divided into two. All left you see everything: at 50& of the way you see `k= {14,15}`, and all the way to the right you see `k=15`. I am sure @matthias knows already this is good Ux practice.  \n\n[quote=\"Wojt, post:172, topic:13988\"]\nCan I query the Graphryder to show me more than two codes co-occuring? Say I want to see how often \u201cCatholic Church\u201d, \u201cpoliticians\u201d and \u201cconservatism\u201d co-occur.\n[/quote]\n\nNo, and I do not recommend you do that. It takes you into [hypergraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph) territory. Hypergraphs are cool but kind of pointless, you can do with normal edges (connect exactly two nodes) everything you can do with hyperedges (connect n>2 nodes). \n\nI suggest the following:\n\n1. In the codes co.occurrence graph, locate one of the codes you are interested to, say `catholic church`. Select the neighborhood interactor, then click on that node. This highlights the node itself and all its neighbors.\n\n![image|690x458](upload://gcIUjQO7rUzkA4GusNzP7k5LV8b.jpeg) \n\n2. Locate the other codes you want. They should be in the neighborhood of the first one. Here we do not have `politicians` and `conservatism`, but we do have `politicisation` and `discrimination`. Note that `politicisation` and `discrimination` are connected to each other, and thus form a triangle with `catholic church`. A triangle is not exactly the same thing as a triple co-occurrence, but it is a powerful topological feature, well studied in network literature. What it tells you is that these three codes form a cohesive group: removing any single connection does not break it down, it simply reconfigures the triangle into a V-shape. You can then click on the eye interactor and (if Graphryder works, which at some point it will) go read the posts on each of the three edges of the triangle.\n\nYou could also look for larger cohesive structures, of which graph theory knows many (cliques larger than 3 nodes, k-cores etc., modularity-maximizing partition classes etc), and knows how to interpret them, has created the open source software libraries to find them etc. Hypergraph math is much less developed, it's a cool generalization but, to my knowledge, no one has yet come up with a concrete issue that can not be attacked without hypergraphs.", "created_at": "2020-10-07 22:58:19.987581", "updated_at": "2020-10-07 22:58:19.987581", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 576, "wiki": false, "reads": 10, "score": 37.0, "like_count": 2, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 2, "quotes_posts": [84578, 84575], "is_reply_to": [84578, 84575], "is_liked_by": [4022, 6484], "is_private": false}, {"id": 6549, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 4122, "post_number": 2, "raw": "<b>I'm into figuring out assumptions</b>\n\nAt least the first two community calls sound very useful for completeley non-market wise people like myself.

dedicated to the [Green Deal Call](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1669) (deadline 26th of January 2021) and the strategy for RezNet. We mapped the calls most relevant for us and the aim is now to go deeper in each and decide on the next steps. \n\nWe will try to keep the call to 1h but please budget 1h30 just in case.\n\nAs it was our usual practice so far, in applying for these calls we can distinguish between two scenarios: \n1)  offer our methodology and integrate our \"standard\" workpackage in the already forming consortium. \n2) start from the concept note and build the consortium ourselves. \n\nThe Agenda is as follows: \n\n- welcome (5 mins)\n- Green Deal Call presentation by Marina (20 mins)\n- team discussion (30-45 mins) - let's try to answer these questions: \n\n    - where do you see the most potential for us? On what call(s) should we focus more? \n   - What do we want to achieve? How the participation in this programme can contribute to RezNet's long-term goals?\n   - what is THE call for which we could write a concept note? Any ideas to pursue?\n   - which call could be used as a \"bridge grant\" before we apply to the synergy grant in 2022? (this point requires some context - @amelia do you want to present briefly the idea and then we discuss which call would be a fit?) \n   - any partners to suggest? \n   - tips & tricks on reaching out to potential partners? The basic idea is to first register our interest for each specific call on the participants portal then evaluate the invitations we receive and enter in negotiations; reach out to individuals via Linkedin and arrange 1:1 meetings; attend online networking events; reach out to personal connections. Anything else?\n\nWe can consider using the breakout rooms and group the questions above in three topics: \n\n1) Green Deal potential - calls to pursue \n2) Longer term RezNet Strategy \n3) Outreach strategy for building or getting into the consortia\n\nEach discussion in the breakout room would last 15 mins, after which one representative from each room would present in 5 minutes the main points, followed by a 10 minute group discussion. \n\nWe can decide on this before or at the beginning of the call.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or anything to add to the agenda or in the questions above, please do so by Wednesday (this is a wiki). \n\nIt would be great if the whole team could be present: @alberto @nadia @amelia @hugi @matthias @johncoate @noemi @MariaEuler @martin\n       \n@IvanC could you take notes this time as well? @bojanbobic will you also be joining?", "created_at": "2020-10-19 09:58:57.086279", "updated_at": "2020-10-22 10:28:47.172415", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 444, "wiki": true, "reads": 13, "score": 92.6, "like_count": 5, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [6670, 4022, 4934, 3, 5], "is_private": false}, {"id": 2749, "user_id": 1867, "topic_id": 2716, "post_number": 1, "raw": "Hey,\n\n<span>Hope you're enjoying your weekend so far!

Registration </span></strong>\n\n<strong><span>2. 5 min intro by UNDP </span></strong>\n\n<strong><span>3. Call with Edgeryders begins</span></strong>\n\n<span>So we thought it would be interesting to have you present for the <strong>opening circle</strong> so you can have an idea of what the attendees are doing and who they are. Basically each person will introduce themselves and what they're doing in social innovation in one sentence. </span>\n\n<span>Then you guys will tell us <strong>Edgeryder's story, including success stories</strong> so that people can get to know you; attendees will have the chance to ask you questions and you will then get their <strong>feedback </strong>on <strong>how they think Edgeryder's can be effective in Egypt. </strong></span>\n\n<span>Finally, we also feel it is important that you give them a brief description of <strong>how to use the Edgeryder's platform</strong> for Spot the Future.</span>\n\n<strong><span>4. Skype call ends </span></strong>\n\n<span><strong>5. Open Space: </strong>we will set up three rooms one for 'share your initiative', 'caring for commons' and 'making a living'. Attendees will go to whichever room they prefer to and engage in general discussions.</span>\n\n<span><strong>6. Individual Harvest -</strong> We will ask them to sign up on Edgeryders and share the ideas they came up with during the dinner We will set up a laptop station in each room so they can at least sign up on the platform there.</span>\n\n<span><strong>7. Closing Circle</strong></span>\n\n<span>The whole idea is to introduce the social innovators to Edgeryders on a direct and personal level, and this will be done best by you of course!! No one can ever tell your story better than you will! If the evening is successful and we were able to get them really interested, they will definitely be motivated enough to join the community and continue the discussions online by their own choice!</span>\n\n<span>I hope one (or more) of you will have enough time on Monday - it probably won't take more than 30 mins! We're planning on moving fast and for everything to be brief and to the point as possible. I really think this dinner will also be a great opportunity for you to get a sense of what some the innovators community is like in Egypt and for you guys to have a chat. There will definitely be lots of interesting people!</span>\n\n<span>Let me know what you think :) </span>\n\n<span>Here's a link to the event for anyone who's interested :https://www.facebook.com/events/603892006370040/</span>\n\n", "created_at": "2014-04-12 17:59:20", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:38:14.931123", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 606, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 13786, "user_id": 650, "topic_id": 1452, "post_number": 5, "raw": "<b>reply</b>\n\nHello Luna!\n\n\u00a0\n\nNice to meet you as well. :)\n\n\u00a0\n\nYour questions are not new to me.

The problem of village logistics](#chap-1)**\n\n**[2. Basic idea and design outline](#chap-2)**\n\n**[3. Design details](#chap-3)**\n\n**[4. Operation as a logistics system](#chap-4)**\n\n**[5. Ideas that extend the concept](#chap-5)**\n\n------\n\n\n## 1. The problem of village logistics <a name=\"chap-1\"></a>\n\nOver the recent months, I spent quite some hours thinking about adequate logistics systems for rural, hilly Nepal. Especially for the villages not having road connections for now \u2013 is getting \"the road\" really the only way of development? Because with the road comes pollution, road accidents, and a faster pace of life.\n\nActually, transport for people is not that much of an issue (except for medical emergencies of course): for their occasional travels to the cities, people walk to the next road / bus stop.  Means we only need a solution for transporting goods \u2013 the big problem is indeed load transportation. Where this takes much effort, access to market is difficult, earning money is difficult, and supply is difficult. Load transport has to be more efficient (in personal time units) than relying on porters, carrying things oneself, or using mules.\n\n\n## 2. Basic idea and design outline <a name=\"chap-2\"></a>\n\nAerial ropeways are one solution for this, but the problem is that they require a lot of additional infrastructure, and the cost of that hinders the widespread deployment (they are also infrastructure with a single point of failure, which was the demise in [previous ropeway installations in Nepal](http://www.nwcf.org.np/cms/resources/pdf/Ropeway.pdf)). This is not the case when reusing the existing foot path network!\n\nSo here is a proposal that I think is my best idea for this so far. It would put Nepal into the same league with the countries most advanced both in electrical transportation and autonomous vehicles, while at the same time needing no additional roads or other infrastructure. The technology is cheap and can be managed locally (given some training).\n\nThe basic idea is a narrow (max. 80 cm wide) autonomous vehicle for load transportation on foot tracks. The vehicle would be able to carry 40-100 kg, depending on the exact design, and navigate autonomously using a line on the ground, or optical beacons, or a guide wire. To be able to drive on even narrower footpaths, the vehicle could also have only two in-line wheels, using [self-balancing technology](https://www.bikesales.com.au/editorial/details/a-105635) as known from motorcycle innovations.\n\nAnother advantage of transport on foot tracks is that these transporters can use the small wire bridges which are popular in Nepal's hilly area and mountains. No need to create much more expensive, heavy-weight bridges for cars.\n\nI'm not saying that constructing such a robot is simple, but it is much simpler than building one for full-scale city traffic. It can completely avoid roads, since there is always a footpath available in Nepal as an alternative route.\n\n\n## 3. Design details <a name=\"chap-3\"></a>\n\nI propose it would be a transporter built with bicycle parts like an electric cargo quadracycle, but without a place for a rider. And since standard bicycle parts are used, maintenance and repairs are simple and cheap. For example, wheels should be standard 26\" mountain bike wheels. These vehicles will be slow (say 3 km/h uphill, 8 km/h on flat terrain, up to 15 km/h downhill) and can carry much less than trucks, but since they are autonomous, they can drive all day and even through the night (at least the way back downhill, and also uphill if having access to grid-connected charging stations in houses along the way). Also, even with modern jeeps but safe driving you get hardly 8-10 km/h when offroad driving on \"roads\" in Nepal's hills (been there, done that) \u2013 so the autonomous vehicles will be just a bit slower given that they can shortcut the road with footpaths.\n\nIt will be powered by a relatively small Li-Ion battery and recharge with photovoltaic cells that it carries as a roll with it, and deploys on the roadside in sunny spots when it has to charge. (Alternatively, there could be charging stations every few kilometers, but that is less flexible and more expensive for the first few vehicles.) Frequent charging stops are not a problem when transportation is automated.\n\nFor energy storage, free, used 18650 Li-Ion cells harvested from notebook batteries, powertool batteries and the like are a more affordable and more economic solution than ultracapacitors \u2013 it is more economical even though ultracaps do not wear down. Because to cover 1 km between charging stations at 17% slope uphill with a 80 kg total weight bicycle, about 33 Wh are needed, which cost 430 EUR in supercapacitors at 13 EUR/Wh. Li-Ion cells on the other hand are free when harvesting used ones, and can be used for 1000-2000 cycles if charging to only 3.92 V/cell. Assuming 1500 cycles and one cycles per day on average, that's 4-5 years on one battery pack until it degraded to 70% its original capacity (and even then, it can still be used).\n\nThe Li-Ion battery has to be large enough to allow a 1.5 W load per cell or lower, since that is how used cells last the longest (due to their reduced current carrying capacity). That is easily solved by letting the vehicle go a very slow speed, which is also great for reducing breakage and maintenance anyway. At (say) 3 km/h, driving 15% uphill with a 80 kg total weight vehicle will need about 100 W, so about 66 Li-Ion 18650 cells (very doable). At 2 Wh/cell typical charge capacity (3 Wh/cell remaining capacity, charged to 3.92 V/cell or about 66% capacity), this means 130 Wh total energy content, or 80 minutes of driving, covering 4 km. So a reasonable proposal would be 100-cell batteries and recharging approx. every 5 km (or further, depending on how steep the uphill slope is).\n\nThe low power needs of 100 W maximum (or even just 50 W maximum if reducing the uphill speed to half) mean that DC motors from battery power drills or (better) electric wheelchairs can be used. These are available nearly for free second-hand.\n\nIn the case of powerdrill motors, no gearbox is needed, since a max. speed of 3 km/h is acceptable and the motor can cover a range of 0-3 km/h by itself by just using a PWM motor controller as integrated in power drills. For a constant reduction gear, one can simply use a bicycle chain gear, a bicycle chain, and a very large (ca. 30-40 cm diameter) DIY gear mounted to the bicycle wheel. Each wheel or each axle can have its own DC motor, and the DC motors incl. the reduction gear mechanism of the front axle would simply move with the wheel when it is steered. This way, the vehicle is a 4x4, making it much more capable on muddy tracks.\n\n\n## 4. Operation as a logistics system <a name=\"chap-4\"></a>\n\nTo make operating this device possible in the long term (means, incl. maintenance), it would be operated as a service, with village people paying to get items delivered to and from their village, or later also to other places (like, to and from their fields). This is in contrast to people owning their own vehicles.\n\nThe vehicle would have a simple display with a selection mechanism so people can select its next destination. This allows to build a network of paths using optical beacons, but also requires that the vehicle can navigate bifurcations etc., and determine its position.\n\nThe operators would have to be technologically skilled, perhaps young people from a nearby city creating a startup. Though I am not sure yet what the fees could be and how profitable a company would be offering this as a service. However, such a company has the advantage that scaling comes with cost advantages: one team can operate a fleet of 100-200 of these devices driving around in one district. They will all operate autonomously, until they break (in which case, they can be towed by another device and collected in a workshop until the travelling operators get there).\n\n\n## 5. Ideas that extend the concept <a name=\"chap-5\"></a>\n\n**Operation as a trailer.** In addition, it should be possible to tow this vehicle as a bicycle and motorcycle trailer, allowing to move it faster when accompanied by a person. This is useful to move it around within a settlement, or when it broke down and has to be towed to a workshop.\n\n**Combination with aerial ropeways.** In addition to using foot tracks and wire bridges, the transporters could even be enabled to use aerial ropes by themselves (hooking themselves to them with an overhead arm, rolling along them, hooking off at the end). This allows shortcutting the way over creeks (where a bridge is not existing or much further) and also to navigate aerial 1-3 km ropeways to go a shortcut over difficult mountain terrain. The cheap battery power enables this new kind of ropeway. What makes it esp. cheap is that it only needs bamboo towers and a single steel rope (or chain or fabric belt), no moving elements at all. The carriages will propel themselves along the rope with rubber wheels on top and below the carrying rope (or, in the case of chains, hard rubber or plastic wheels with cavings to grab the chain elements). Also, since footpaths are used for most of the way, only a bit of new construction is needed, driving down costs further.\n\n**Protocol for interaction with humans.** For operational safety, the vehicle needs a way to avoid collisions with humans, animals and objects. On footpaths, the worst that can happen is encountering a motorcycle. Having a flashing beacon light on its top will help, and a simple protocol like \"autonomous vehicle will stop at the side of the road when you honk three times, so you can overtake it safely\". Which would make it the 1001st use of the horn in Nepal :D", "created_at": "2016-06-21 10:54:00", "updated_at": "2018-10-30 16:52:19.356650", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1715, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 35.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 16418, "user_id": 128, "topic_id": 1670, "post_number": 6, "raw": "<b>Using flags</b>\n\nReally interesting analysis !\n\n\u00a0\n\nConcerning platform functionnalities, there are some good modules for drupal that can help to track, share and organise content i've tried on demopolitique platform :\n\n<strong>Flags\u00a0</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/flag\">Drupal module</a>\n\nAllows users to bookmark content and can be extended to much more uses.\n\n\u00a0\n\n<strong>Community tags</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/community_tags\">Drupal module</a>\n\nAllows users to participate in organising data by using tags.

I think I disagree about Red Plenty! \n\nFirst, I think he's careful to withhold judgment about shadow pricing. He's all about saying \"what if?\" and then withdrawing (which makes it great for discussion, right?). But also, we are acclimatized to assume that shadow pricing and centralized control would have been a disaster, so I think he does nudge us to try to imagine it working. He invokes this brief window in the 60s when Soviet planners were preparing to set aside their abacuses in favour of these new magic calculating machines filled with mysterious promise; when Khrushchev was in charge and wanted to beat capitalism at the things the capitalists said they were best at (material abundance for ordinary people); and when mathematical economics was flourishing and people like Kantorovich were proposing radical new reforms to how centralized planning worked. But then that window closed: Krushchev was deposed, Kantorovich's ideas were not really adopted, and ... well, lots of stuff happened. The direction changed. I think Stufford is asking us to imagine what might been.\n\nI would love to find out more about shadow pricing, by the way. I don't think Spufford really explains it -- something about calculating the value of commodities (or actually, factors of production) in terms of their opportunity cost, and getting each producer to maximise profit. But I don't really understand how it works. I know there was also the socialist calculation debate in the West, and market socialists like Oskar Lange proposed something which I think was similar, wasn't it? \n\nSecond, bureaucracy as such is also not Spufford's <i>major</i> focus, is it? It's true that, in that excellent chapter describing the material balances method of central planning (the system that haphazardly grew up during the Stalin years), there are thousands of folders and an extremely onerous decision-making process. \n\nBut it felt to me like his focus was really on: (a) the artistry and imagination of the planner (who is able to sort a problem out much more quickly than the mathematicians have \"proved\" would be necessary); (b) the fact that these decisions emerge from the personal power of an official, rather than the impersonal power of his office; (c) the possibility that this process is ripe for some kind of techno-scientific rationalization, and especially ...\n\n(d) the vast network of informal decision-making that is neither bureaucratic in the strict sense, nor market-based. Maybe this is really the same point as (b). By \"bureaucratic in the strict sense\" I mean formal, legalistic, to do with the application of rules (whether those rules are applied well or poorly). Spufford seems way more interested in things that don't have formal procedures: the negotiation, the bluffing, the tricks, the favours, the threats, the kindnesses, the artistry, and as you say, the power games. \n\nWe could call all that \"corruption,\" but I think we might miss some of the interesting questions if we did that. It might be better to think of it as \"embeddedness\" (term associated with Karl Polanyi): the way that economic decisions are always shaped by the non-economic context in which they occur. This theme of embeddedness runs throughout the subplot about the vicose factory, first when we see things from the planner's perspective, and then from the perspective of Chekuskin the fixer or 'pusher' (tolkach). Tolkach deal-making, Spufford says, is halfway between a purely commercial black market, and a \"thoroughly mystified\" gift economy consisting of a \"backscratching of many overlapping circles of friends.\" For the tolkach, \"The money was there, the price of a transaction had to be paid, but the object was to find non-money reasons for the transaction to take place.\"\n\nYou could question to some extent whether shadow pricing IS entirely \"centralized.\" Isn't it an attempt to synthesise a centralized plan with a certain amount of de-centralized decision-making?\n\nBTW, interesting note on bureaucracy:\n\n\"They acted as progress-chasers, fixers, censors, seducers\": but not, by design, as bureaucrats, in one very specific sense of the word. The Soviet Union had regular campaigns against \u2018bureaucracy\u2019, hard though this is for an outsider to make immediate sense of in a system where every employee was a state employee. \u2018Bureaucracy\u2019 as a Soviet pejorative implied coldness, impersonality, slowness, trivial rulefollowing. Apparatchiks were supposed, by contrast, to be quick, \u2018conscious\u2019, lively, free to engage in brilliant improvisation to get the job done by any means necessary. See Fitzpatrick, Everyday Stalinism, pp.28\u201335.

Still, a great opportunity.\u00a0\n\nhttp://translate.google.com/translate?sl=it&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=it&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fmilano.repubblica.it%2Fcronaca%2F2012%2F09%2F29%2Fnews%2Fcomune_le_nuove_regole_per_gli_spazi_abbandonati-43494208%2F\n\n", "created_at": "2012-10-27 23:44:06", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:41:01.435771", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 136, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [14198], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 25214, "user_id": 605, "topic_id": 1321, "post_number": 12, "raw": "<b>Inter Esse!!</b>\n\nI am another yourself and thanks for this amazing mission answer!! I really enjoyed reading .. so much new and interesting things in there!\n\nLet me start with my name. \"Chara\" in Greek means \"joy\" or \"hapiness\" and my parents gave this name to me because as a baby I was all the time laughing and smiling! And I think they were right because I am still doing it :)\u00a0\n\nI think you are right that by saying that people tend to identify themselves according to their professions and jobs, because this is the easiest way to do it. For me it is more doing a lot of things, feel fullfilment and happyness. Yesterday actually something really weird happened to me.. I went for a job interview in a very well known company in Vienna. They are this kind of company who seem to hire more open minded and creative young people. During the interview they asked me if I am going to keep some other professional activities in paralel with the new job. I said of course I will keep some social entrepreneurship projects that I m currently doing.. This apparently was the minute when the CEO of this company got mad and crazy!! He told me that I am old enought (25 y.o) and I need for the rest 10 years stay focused on just ONE thing in my life, not being spontaneous and not \"moving so fast\".... I felt so bad and so upset... It s maybe the way I am raised, but I don't want to be this one dimension person that just gets up every morning and goes to work to stay there for 8 hours and then back home! I need to have different things in all my aspects and this is the way I keep being motivated and inspired.. I really didnt get any of his points specially when they want to sell the image of a very fun, young and cool brand :S\u00a0\n\n<em>\"the point of living is to experience happyness\"\u00a0</em>this is one of the most nicest things every read..

Thank you so much for sharing this!\u00a0\n\nYour story reminds me of <a href=\"http://collaborativeconsumption.com/\">this book</a> on collaborative consumption - you've probably come across it. The gist of it is that you can reconcile frugality (of money) with abundance (of things) by increasing the efficiency in consumption. Your children's game consoles are a perfect example: instead of lying unused or being thrown away, they go in for another round of entertaining another kid (this is waaay more difficult with housing, by the way, but even there people like <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/who-ryder-what-edge/mission_case/permanent-collective-leipzig\">Dante</a> are trying to find ways).\u00a0\n\nAnd this is a skill. A very, very important one. Me, I think I could benefit from someone with that skill in two ways. Firstly, as a teacher. Can I learn to control my consumption? I feel constrained on the cognitive side: since my own intellectual journey takes up so much space, I find it impossibly difficult to hack my lifestyle. I can not buy stuff, that's relatively easy, but selling stuff on eBay is kind of too big a project. Secondly, as a symbiont. If you and I lived in a partially collaborative constellation (like the one <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/spotlight-social-innovation/mission_case/cohousing-milano\">Simone</a> managed to get going) you could help to optimize resources, whereas I am probably better at collecting them. The whole would make exactly what you have in mind: doing more for more people, with less.

Thus, the whole event becomes more of a master-pupil relationship and there is no proper feedback to obtain.\u00a0\n\nWith the kf\u00e9, we (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/margaojeda\">Marga</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/israelkp\">Israel</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/jorgetarres\">Jorge</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/cataspanglish\">Chris </a>and myself particularly, though I will undoubtedly leave someone out) tried to recover an old tradition of gathering in a coffee shop and talking in a relaxed environments of subjects that matter to all present (instead of just talking of football, which is the usual subject in current bar chats), but where there is no single person that runs the show. The venue coordinator figure is just a person that sets up the subject to be treated, and then tries to ensure the smooth development of the discussion.\u00a0\n\nWith a format like this, the collective knowledge of all 20 people present can be mixed together to create a picture far more interesting, and I believe it's a good way to avoid protagonism and create both ideas and projects that participate in a more 'common' ownership of the information.\u00a0\n\nThat's what made it worth for me to participate, personally.

It worked pretty well and such an approach for various other annoying but necessary tasks such as cleaning can have various side effects :\n\n- no wasted money on such services\n\n- investment in community spirit as these common tasks are shared and can lead to precious shared moments (i remember many good times doing such tasks as cleaning, cooking or washing dishes with friends or family while having loads of fun)\n\n- increased responsibility : the more an individual is aware about what it means to get such a place running well, the more he would be responsible and try to do their best to respect the place.\n\n- awareness on how we can depend on others to do these tasks. Restaurants and pubs are good exemples as you pay for food and drink but also for a service.\n\n2. I'm not sure some time has to be set aside in a strict manner. Volunteering could work well, but depending on the number of people living in the same place, some organisation tools may be needed to circumvent some issues. Like a mobile API that allows to see ongoing projects, their needs and dates and a subscription form, or a simple board may be enough.\n\nAnyway, there are many things to do to get such a place running, and it seems important that everyone takes part of it in a way or the other. At least no one should be a complete burden for the community and just benefit from other's activities.\n\n3. Considering that many people seem to have ideas or projects including locals, i don't think it could turn into solo writers doing their thing and not interacting with others.\n\nWell, we can never be sure. :)\n\nBut interactions seem a crucial point in this project. Sharing knowledge, practices, etc and also simple life moments may be the tissue and power of such a place.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo answer more shortly : yes, you got it right.\n\nHelping and sharing should be part of the deal to be in such place.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-08-03 00:24:00", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:43.280780", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 391, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 5.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 1, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 79637, "user_id": 5059, "topic_id": 13964, "post_number": 4, "raw": "@johncoate, I think that for the purposes you are using the material for, your approach is totally fine (as long as you don't edit so heavily that everyone sounds like a robot).

I don't think we have any in public elementary school (I'm not completely sure) and while we have them in middle school and high school there would be a few \"classi\" of 25 (?) kids having access to them. We also have a language track in high school, in which you study (I think) three foreign languages but the possibility I mentioned before is disappearing with the lastest reform and soon we are not going to have any foreign language beyond english in the other tracks.\n\nPersonally I also went to a bilingual school early on, went to summer programs, and later on exchange programs... It feels like in Italy much depends on private efforts.\n\nHowever, few things have probably changed since I went to primary school and I know that now even some public kindergarten attempt to familiarize children with english.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-10 14:28:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:14.413583", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 257, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [11650], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 54547, "user_id": 4, "topic_id": 9517, "post_number": 9, "raw": "Aha.

This was kind of hovering in the air at and immediately after \\#LOTE: fair play to you for actually going out in the open and making the proposal.\n\nMy two cents: I think an official Edgeryders organization would have <strong>added value to the outside world</strong> if it could feasibly mobilize Egderyders around certain goals or projects. Take me: <a href=\"http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/what-would-you-bring-unmonastery\">I might have a backer for the Unmonastery idea</a>. But there's a catch: I am a little nervous about pushing it through without being sure that a core group of smart. hard working and charismatic people from the community will apply to join the Unmonastery- an make the whole idea more attractive and credible by powering it. An ER organization with a little traction would make me feel more comfortable: once the board says it's in, it's in.\n\nAt the same time, I think that an official Edgeryders organization would be <strong>sustainable if it could provide added value to the Egderyders themselves in pursuing their own projects</strong>. Who wants to be a member of an organization when membership does not really mean anything in terms of how we live our lives? And in fact, you seem to attribute to it only one function: fundraising.\u00a0\n\nFunctionally speaking, it could be feasible. The question is who is going to put in the heavy lifting, and do all of the hustling for the others to go out and play! It is very possible that many people would want in, but few would want to raise \"common\" funding. A solution to the dilemma could be to give this organization a more detailed mission, that allows it to act as an enabler while still being cool while it does so. Again, the Unmonastery is a good example: it is essentially an enabling mechanism, but I am up for doing (well, trying anyway) the heavy lifting because it is a <em>very cool</em>, potentially game-changing enabling mechanism.\u00a0\n\n", "created_at": "2012-08-09 18:53:48", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:33.696694", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 364, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 75.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 15, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 21618, "user_id": 7, "topic_id": 1687, "post_number": 6, "raw": "I just wanted to say that this is a great project :) Extremely interesting, especially within the theories of nationalism and national identity.

What drew me to the Internet was not the presence of shiny, easy-to-use, free services \u2013 they were not there in the early days. On the contrary, you had to put in time and money if you wanted to, as we said then, \"connect to the Internet\". \n\nBut the reward was high. *Whatever your tribe, you would find it*. Whether you cared about particle physics, detective stories or board games, countless like-minded people were waiting for you \"out there\". And yes, you would occasionally encounter conflict and rants, but they would be overwhelmed by the sense of being welcome, of belonging. For me \u2013 a bookish, weird kid from an Italian small town, who was into weird music, it was a lifeline. \n\nBut, of course, it was not about me. The sense of community was pervasive, generalized. \n\n> My direct observations of online behaviour around the world over the past ten years have led me to conclude that whenever computer-mediated communications technology becomes available to people anywhere, they inevitably build virtual communities with it, just as microorganisms inevitably create colonies.\n\nThese words were written by @howard_rheingold in 1994, in a seminal book called *[The Virtual Community](https://books.google.be/books?id=fr8bdUDisqAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=rheingold+virtual+community&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0_MaQsa7oAhXHMewKHffIBlAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=rheingold%20virtual%20community&f=false)*. In the intervening years, however, some of that sense of community has been lost. Some American computer networks had been offering commercial services since the late 1980s; in 1992, US Congress pass a law that allowed the academic NSFNET, to connect to those commercial networks, and the latter to use NSFNET as their infrastructural backbone. Seven years later, the dotcom boom showed everyone the money-making potential of the Internet. The original \"digital settlers\" described by Howard's book were still out there, but increasingly drowned out by corporate types. The idea itself of virtual community gave way to that of social networking service (Facebook and similar), and the communitarian early Internet of the 1990s to the surveillance capitalist one of today. \n\nThen COVID-19 hit. \n\nSuddenly, everyone's social media feed is full of bottom-up, self-organized initiatives for mutual aid. Everyone is releasing previously paywalled content, offering help, creating resources and directories. Is the communitarian Internet back? The question is important, because Edgeryders considers itself a virtual community, one of the last of the original, early wave virtual communities. We were born as a response to the previous crisis, the 2008 financial collapse. In the wake of COVID-19, we are mobilizing, just like everybody else ([example](/t/12962), [other example](/t/12886)). But: are we doing enough? Are we making the right moves? \n\nThe right person to ask is obviously Howard himself. He and @johncoate are old friends, so I asked John to ask Howard if he would agree to a video call between the three of us. He did, and just like that we were conversing across an ocean and eight time zones. \n\n### On coordinating and integrating the community's response\n\n @howard_rheingold:\n \n > Have you guys thought of taking on the work of coordinating between large organizations and this patchwork of initiatives that are popping up in response to COVID-19?\n \n@alberto \n \n > Yes, but we struggle. Everyone is shouting for attention. And what you call greenspaces (nice name, by the way!) seem mostly hyperlocal, ephemeral \u2013 they are out there, but I do not see them connecting. No one is keeping track of the big picture.\n \n@howard_rheingold:\n \n > Right now, people are super focused on just doing the job. I would suggest to compile a list of things that are happening, putting it online, and then inviting everyone to meet others. Point to something, and tell people \"Look, we can get together and help each other!\"\n >\n > I know it sounds difficult. It is. But look: with COVID-19, this is the first time that everyone on Earth is thinking about the same thing. Additionally, everyone is closer to each other because everyone is online. We now see people organizing Zoom calls with their friends. \n >\n > And note this: this is all happening two years into a backlash against \"big tech\", when people \u2013 at least here in America \u2013 are starting to regard Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook with suspicion and even fear. There is again some space for doing good online. We can take back the Internet! The start of a network, of an online community is very much like what we are doing here, the three of us having a Zoom call. We look at our computer screen, and see people. Hey, it's people! I see their faces!  We are all doing it anyway because of the pandemic, let's maintain this greenspace online, these convivial spaces. Note that some of it is not even on the web, but on the indieweb \u2013 spaces like [Scuttlebutt](/t/9802), that run their own protocols.\n\n\n### On helping folks to bringing work online\n\nHoward thinks the COVID-19 fallout offers an opportunity to rethink the way we collaborate in our daily work. \n\n> I have been working for a few years on the idea of remote working. I see the COVID epidemics as a force that could accelerate a societal shift that we should do anyway, for the sake of climate change. \n\nAn *id\u00e9e fixe* of Howard's is [move conferences online](https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-to-plan-and-34594233). Just [like ourselves](/t/11263), he got interested in it mostly because large international conferences have a large climate impact. Of course, this is not at all easy, and requires effort; but suddenly, from lockdown, we are discovering that it might be possible after all. A similar advance is happening in the world of online learning (again, Howard was one the pioneers of this), as schools and universities bend over backwards to reach out to locked-down students.\n\n> You could be bringing orgs to remote work. In my experience, most people doing it have an approach oriented to deploying tools, typically chosen by some IT department. They miss completely the human and social dimension of working online. Community managers have existed for almost 40 years \u2013 actually John, here, was the person who first used the expression \"community manager\"! They are key to getting humans to work together well online, but they are typically excluded from the corporate world. \n\nHelping people to work online is super powerful, because it increases manifold the efficiency of their organizations. @howard_rheingold:  \n\n> This is a historical transition. I predict that, at the end, medical/scientific work will be enormously accelerated by this connectivity. \n\n@johncoate: \n\n> Howard, do you think that Slack is a complete solution to online collaboration?\n\n@howard_rheingold:\n\n> No, I do not. Slack is good at coordination, but not at accumulating/organizing knowledge. For that you need a forum. Also, in general, different people are comfortable with different media. So, a mix of media is needed. Like now we are talking on videoconference, then I suppose someone will do a writeup of it, and so on. That is a good thing.  \n\n@alberto:\n\n> ... though then curation becomes even more important, both human curation (community management) and content curation (wikis, documentation etc.). Very easy to lose the overview of a workstream that happens in many different spaces. In Edgeryders we have found nothing better than a combination of recaps (written, as posts in the forum) and periodic (virtual) team meetings.\n\n(*Photo: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HowardRheingoldJI4.jpg*)", "created_at": "2020-03-25 12:58:04.797664", "updated_at": "2020-12-15 15:50:23.663295", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 1266, "wiki": false, "reads": 52, "score": 4042.4, "like_count": 12, "reply_count": 2, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [8, 3, 4096, 2915, 4934, 5, 3677, 1877, 5209, 3293, 3310, 6444], "is_private": false}, {"id": 68530, "user_id": 3206, "topic_id": 11945, "post_number": 11, "raw": "[quote=\"marijanesque, post:10, topic:11945\"]\n\u0160to se ti\u010de planova za dalje, kada su u pitanju radionice u Be\u010deju, mogu potvrditi da biblioteka, kao ustanova, pa i direktorica li\u010dno, daje punu podr\u0161ku za dalje korake u realizaciji ovih radionica.

As my knowledge in electronics is based on open source and DIY, the devices included in the laboratory are portable replications of a microscope, a speculum done with a 3D printer, an incubator, PCR, centrifuge ... \n\nSince September 2012 I collaborate with the international network of biohacking Hackteria and I currently developing a line of hardware (HardGlam) for Gynepunk project and also working as a collaborator for the Strogens project with Mary Maggic, Byron Rich and Gaia Leandra.\n\nDuring the last year we were collaborating and making grow this project at Barcelona https://www.gridspinoza.net/en/programs/prototypome that comes from the interaction of Pechblenda and Hackteria lab \n\nhttp://jellypin.hotglue.me/\nvisual map of projects, reading from right to the left, from individual to collective body ( net of iteractions )\n\nhttp://hackteria.org/ \nbiohacker biopunk network and wiki to document all the process and DIWO projects from hardware to wetlab \n\nhttp://calafou.org  \nhttp://wiki.calafou.org/index.php/Pechblenda  \ncollective space for autonomous free and open tech/nature projects\nHardlab TransHackFeminista - lab0rat0rio experimentaci0n bio-electr0-qu\u00edmica \nhttp://pechblenda.hotglue.me/ \nhttp://network23.org/pechblendalab/\n\nhttp://biosensing-blog.tumblr.com/  \nplants queer microorganism beings more than Human...  machine interactions (2012-2013)\nphotosynthesis love\n\nhttp://transnoise.tumblr.com/\nhttp://akelarrecyborg.tumblr.com", "created_at": "2017-10-16 21:42:23.954169", "updated_at": "2018-11-22 21:24:45.875758", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 471, "wiki": false, "reads": 16, "score": 113.2, "like_count": 1, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [3], "is_private": false}, {"id": 38404, "user_id": 3973, "topic_id": 7416, "post_number": 5, "raw": "Natalia -- That's amazing!

This is a distributed body both locationally and also in terms of valus and skills. 'Distribution' as an organizational aspect, or as a value, may be the very thing that links us all.\n\nThen there is community building, if we are new, then (and we are already making great headway here) we need first explain our position to the elders (Lote1) then, with their consent, we educate the community with the most structured educational form being for youth, as they will be the future creators and so need at least some basis in an informed notion of the present as percieved by people who live and work here.\n\nI see YY (Yunus Youth) as being very interested in this. Then there are other social investment companies who will fund the nodes locally once they understand the model. Such as the 'Business in the Community' foundation and the ' The community foundation for Ireland' here in Ireland who fund seed initiatives with small startup grants. These must exist in every country surely. \n\nFor placemaking we need an integrative strategy, looking at locale's and figuring out the best way to operate within them. Take my hometown for example, we have lots of single mothers, so childcare is important, and it just so happens there is a social enterprise in Ireland focussing on childcare, so we team up and go find a building from local council and approach a social investment company for startup funding based on clear measurable metrics. \n\nThis kind of organization can only be done by local nodes, whereas it requires the authority of a transnational organizatioon with EU backing to overcome the local bias (in Ireland this is a defininte must...v.conservative)", "created_at": "2012-11-21 15:26:04", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:54.928478", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 409, "wiki": false, "reads": 2, "score": 0.4, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [21546], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 39095, "user_id": 4034, "topic_id": 7625, "post_number": 2, "raw": "A warm welcome to Edgeryders, @NickKauf.

Our idea is that the people\u2019s needs or \u201cprojects brief\u201d come from the interaction between students and community. Needs are based on problem that community faces every day. Community care about that problems and is interested in solving them. Nowadays we have students that go out of the university just to collect information and then come back to develop in a \u201csecret\u201d way they project they are working for. We would like to change the current design process through activities such as co-design to make feasible our project and make the people of Bovisa feel part of the \u201cteam\u201d.\n\n<b>WHAT?</b>\n\nThe people of the neighborhood offer us information about the real problems present and we provide them with solutions. Since design students work on different topics every year there is the possibility to develop projects from different areas of expertise and give to teams the opportunity to learn on the fly and testing their ideas in the real world.\n\n<b>HOW?</b>\n\nWe would like to achieve that goal through the involvement of some fix representative of University such as professors. They work as facilitator in order to promote this projects to different courses or levels. We would create an Identity for this initiative in order to make it visible and recognizable. By using a common platform, we want to show what we can do for them and stimulate the conversation about what could be done. Students will have the possibility to organize activities such as focus group, workshop, games etc. to collect knowledge and involving people. Exhibitions of the projects in the neighborhood could be the possibility to share the outcome with the community and make an evaluation of them. In this way, there will be the opportunity to take the most suitable solution and implement them.\n\n", "created_at": "2017-05-10 08:20:01", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:40:33.503944", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 402, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 4433, "user_id": 2546, "topic_id": 4400, "post_number": 1, "raw": "<a href=\"/u/community_service_of\">@Community_Service_of_Nepal</a>\u00a0has been actively participating in relief of Earthquake Victims in Nepal.

Please check https://preciousplastic.com/en/machines.html\nThe blue prints for the machines are all open source, and Precious Plastic created a series of YouTube tutorials to help those interested with the construction process. \nMoreover, Precious Plastic doesn't revolve around design alone, it has grown out to a global community that shares skills and knowledge. \n\nI checked their community map and, as of today, there is no Precious Plastic Lab in Egypt yet. \nWith Cairo in mind, a mega-city struggling with massive amounts of (plastic) garbage being thrown away every day, I could imagine teaming up with informal-sector garbage collectors (Zabbaleen) to get the plastic you would need to produce the designs, and/or connecting with the already existing Zebala stores.

But by the time of LOTE1 many people who are active in the community now were already on board.\n\n2. We managed to build a very radical, high energy event format.

But in general, we are not trying to achieve anything except stay in touch: the value, what helps us advance our projects, is in the community, not in the event. The event is simply a way to touch base, start new projects, make alliances... Also, we built autonomy: LOTE1 was heavily funded by the Council of Europe, LOTE2 was community driven but with a bit of money by the COE, LOTE3 was completely autonomous (though Comitato Matera 2019 gave us a building and connectivity), LOTE4 has again a bit of money raised by the company and community.\n\n5.

I know for example that the description of how the banking system operates can at best be described as extremely misleading.\n\nAgain, I don't like these ideas that it is necessary to increase the money supply to allow production to increase. The price level can go down as well as up, and production deflation which occurs when more stuff gets produced benefits everybody. Also when Economist talk about increasing the money supply they somehow neglect to discuss who ends up receiving that money, and what that does to the wealth gap.\u00a0\n\n1)Not entirely sure what you mean here. Parameters do affect the equations, that's the point of having them. It's perfectly valid to make assumptions such as in the short run it doesn't change very fast for example. But that's just a simplifying argument, and again - I rather suspect what is actually happening is that V is being used as a convenient fudge factor to allow problems in current understanding of the money supply's behaviour to be papered over. So it's not a parameter - it's a magic number - which the economic magician uses to divert attention from the underlying reality of the cold hard numbers.\n\n2) Once velocity is taken out of the equation, and with the assumption that the money supply is held constant, and that GDP is being measured based on the price of all goods and services exchange for money, then yes that is correct, GDP would be constant.\n\n3) GDP is measured as the sum of the value of a certain basket of goods sold, that is the price of those goods, multiplied by the quantity sold. The quantity theory of money says that Price (P) = Total Money Supply(M)/Total Number of transactions(T). Ergo, the total quantity of money is a factor in the calculation of GDP.\n\nThe thought experiment is just a simple example to show that there is at least one value of M, for which V doesn't affect the price level. It's a general rule of mathematics that one counter example is all that you need to disprove a theorem.\n\nCorrelation does not equal causation. Also, the money supply bounces around because of the banking system, and when it contracts it's generally because of some kind of credit crisis.\u00a0\n\nI'm sure V doesn't affect the price level. What if anything it does effect is an interesting question - I'm not quite ready to discard it entirely - but that's why i'm building a simulation.\n\n", "created_at": "2012-04-22 20:45:17", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:13.054249", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 484, "wiki": false, "reads": 1, "score": 0.2, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 11465, "user_id": 21, "topic_id": 1694, "post_number": 3, "raw": "<b>Il nodo edgryders</b>\n\nAbbiamo affittato una fattoria per 350,00 al anno, sono 30.000 mq prato, ed e circondata da boschi di conifere e faggi secolari, tutto di propiet\u00e0 pubblica. il comune dispone di 20.000 euro comunitari, per la ristrutturazione dello stabile, composto da fienile, 2 stalle, un tipico laboratorio per il latte. probabilmente ti sara capitato di vedere il panorami che pibblicavo l'estate passata, abbiamo voluto sperimentare la resilenza passando 3 mesi in loco.\n\nin questo tempo abbiamo lavorato la terra, seminato, e raccolto. il prato lo abbiamo falciato poi l'erba lasciata essicare l'abbiamo raccolta in cumuli(covoni),abbiamo raccolto la legna secca per cucinare e scaldarci, abbiamo raccolto i funghi, abbiamo ripristinato un antico acquedotto dato per spacciato.

For one thing it never fails to amaze me how risk averse certain people I have come across who work within insitutions are. Even though they are as close to impossible to fire. I was asking myself whether it is risk aversion that draws people to working in insititutions or whether insitutions foster risk-aversion in their employees. Who knows. In any case it never comes down to what one or the other person is, says or does. I think that if you want to affect change in which insitutions are a part, insitutional actors have to be put into different feedback loops with their environments. Uncharacteristically for myself I penned a post. Its an invitation to the Edgeryders event in Brussels in December. It is also my synthsis of what we need to make happen together to be able to affect change: http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/blog/2012/10/edgeryders-are-coming-to-brussels-in-december-save-the-date/", "created_at": "2012-10-26 13:49:10", "updated_at": "2017-07-31 18:39:16.542463", "deleted_at": null, "hidden": false, "read_restricted": false, "word_count": 238, "wiki": false, "reads": 4, "score": 0.8, "like_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "quote_count": 0, "quotes_posts": [], "is_reply_to": [], "is_liked_by": [], "is_private": false}, {"id": 82206, "user_id": 3, "topic_id": 14192, "post_number": 18, "raw": "40% is a lot! But especially if the people surveyed are new at this remote working, it does make sense.\n\nIn the first 5-6 years of doing it, I had no filters: no 'working hours', my whole life was working hours, my desk was 2 metres from the bed where I slept, i would wake up and sit at the desk in pijamas, without breakfast for the first 2 hrs, sometimes even smoking (in my bedroom!). If I'd be working from a cafe, i would carry my laptop in a bad bag on my shoulder, even though i had back issues.\nI would work on my holidays (friends would go fishing early morning in a beautiful natural parc and I would start my working day; or we would be in Iceland in a remote cabin and from 6-9am i would work on a pitch before everyone came down for breakfast!). I was unhealthy but very passionate. Maybe it served me well, but at one point your body tells you no.\n\nWhat I do to disconnect:\n- not work on most weekends (when I do, I plan it ahead)\n- not check emails after working hrs (could be 5pm, but also 8pm, again: as long as I am in control)\n- no popup or sound notifications from emails on my phone\n- I dont keep my work communications on social media to not mix the two - only email, slack etc\n- long walks and yoga at least 3 times a week\n- being part of a community of people, like Edgeryders, where health is a topic we address a lot, so I discovered my own challenges by talking to people who shared theirs. This motivated me to become more aware and move in the right direction, by realising overwork and burnout are more widespread than I thought they were.\n- a few years ago, I started to read more about life's bigger purposes, from philosophy all the way to self-help books (!)

I was super busy at that time, and even though I was following along on the new discussions, I was waiting until I finished a big project so I'd have time to participate more once I introduced myself:\n\nI'm Brady, and I live in San Francisco. I am currently the CEO of The WELL, the wonderful 31-year-old online community where I met John. A group of longtime users bought the community a few years ago from the corporation that owned it before us in order to make sure we could keep the historic community going.\n\nAside from running The WELL, I am also a playwright and a theatre arts educator. I have a background in circus (I trained with Ringling Bros and Barnum &amp; Bailey circus) and as a performer, but most of my work these days is from backstage. It was some of the recent discussions in the Op3ncare group that inspired me to finally come and say hello, so I won't be a mysterious stranger if you see me commenting elsewhere.\n\nI teach as an artist-in-residence in the public schools, as well as teaching improvisation and physical theatre to adults. I'm in the very early stages of developing a new project that will use the kind of theatre work I've been doing with teenagers and\u00a0 young adults to strengthen emotional health in disrupted communities.\n\nI am looking forward to seeing you around this site and reading up on what you are all working on, and hopefully we'll all meet somewhere or another one of these days.\n\n(I'm happy to get messages in French or Italian, although I am not very good at writing or speaking.

However, there have been some attempts in some Arab countries. For the current status of Voice Interaction Applications in Arabic, I have Googled around and compiled the following information for you. I hope this helps.\nThere is a company in Dubai, UAE called Votek (operating in Dubai Knowledge Village) who adapted an Arabic Speech Recognition Engine to work with smart phones. The app is available on the App Store for iOS devices.  One domain of applications is to allow iPhone users to search Dubai Government Housing database using Arabic commands in Emirates dialect. Another domain is targeting the development of Smart Toys for kids. They developed a Toy in which the child inserts her/his smart Apple phone inside the Toy and interacts with the Toy in Arabic. The applications require iOS 7.0 or later and can be run on iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. They have other applications. Any way here are some links you can get more information about Votek and their ambitions.\nhttp://votek.me/\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ae/app/m-rf-alaskan/id926512630?mt=8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNI0pMF5eFw&feature=youtu.be\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1A3Tc4WLDI\nYou can also go to these links from their main web page.\nApparently, Votek are very optimistic about the business opportunities for their products! And I am sure the business opportunities will grow with the increase in availability of more applications that will satisfy the market needs. You have to study the needs of the Arabic market for voice activated applications, in particular for popular smart devices, and make your business cases. However, as most Intelligent Personal Assistant Systems (IPAs), like Siri, Google Assistant and others, use already available online resources on internet to answer user queries and because such resources are predominately in English, the biggest hurdle, for voice activated application development, will be the development and availability of open source Arabic databases and online information resources on internet (however, this can be part of the development for special purposes). \nI am sure you are more aware than me of the speech recognition engines, IPAs and the speech recognition API\u2019s for Arabic and other languages that allow you to develop your Speech Activated Application. However, the following information is specific for Arabic speech applications and may be of interest for you.\nSince 2015, Apple has released first Arabic version of Siri for its iOS devices, I think for iOS version 9 and over: https://www.thenational.ae/business/apple-releases-first-arabic-version-of-siri-1.110001\nRecently they introduced the Apple Siri API SiriKit for application development:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/sirikit/\nSince they have Arabic support you can use the API to develop your specific Arabic voice activated applications.\n\nI am not sure if Google Assistant and Google Assistant SDK support Arabic yet but I think that is forthcoming. It is a matter of time. However, since 2012 Google has developed Arabic Speech Recognition for many Arabic speech dialects.\nIt is available for iPhone and Android users. Check out the following links:\nhttps://www.wamda.com/2012/03/arabic-speech-now-recognized-by-google\nhttps://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/languages\nhttps://cloud.google.com/speech/\n\nAndroid and Google have Developer\u2019s Platforms that allows developers to develop voice activated applications using their Speech Recognition API\u2019s. I think you can use them for developing Arabic applications. Please check out the following links:\nhttps://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/Voice interaction in Arabic. This is an area that has been growing very rapidly in North America (think Amazon Echo, Google Home, wearables like smart watches that rely predominantly on speech for interaction) and will continue to grow. The software required to enable anything like this is far behind in Arabic, and I am exploring 1) how to change that and 2) if there is a business opportunity at the moment in doing so.\nhttp://code4reference.com/2012/07/tutorial-android-voice-recognition/\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/SpeechRecognizer.html\n\nDragon Speech Recognition Engine was also available in Arabic for iOS users.

Ethnography of improvised fictional character interactions, how does this strike you? This is obviously very different from what we usually do, but it could be a fascinating project. As the ethnography will be an effort to understand an emerging fictional universe, the ethnographer will in reality be equal parts an author of the fiction and a researcher of the emerging collective consciousness of the group of authors.

The value of work done by students and young graduates at the beginning of their careers is nothing below that of most people in the labor market, and deserves more recognition. We can address current exploitative practices by drafting a law to ban unpaid internships without exception. Another way to go is incentivize payment through funding organizations: we would crowdsource a blacklist-database of organisations that exploit interns. In applying for funding or tenders there is an obligatory check of the database, and if orgs have a bad record they are automatically given lower status in the process. Allies in implementing these would be primarily youth organizations, because fighting for youth rights is in alignment with their goals.\n\n<h2>Help prepare this topic \u2013 right here!</h2>Here's an EtherPad so you all can prepare this part of the LOTE2 \"Policy Hero Challenge\" together ... edit it right here!!
